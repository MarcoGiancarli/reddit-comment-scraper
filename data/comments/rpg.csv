""The Dumbass Coin""  The Dumbass Coin is for use in ongoing campaigns were regular attendance is preferred. If a given player cannot attend that day's session, that player's character will be assigned to the dumbass coin.   The character effectively dumbly follows the party, until the DM calls for a Dumbass check. At that moment, the present players decide what the smartest and dumbest things that character could do. The coin is flipped, and the DM calls the side.   Play then proceeds normally after the missing player's character performs whatever action the coin dictated. Usually to hilarious results."

Honestly, if the players did decide to have a character jump off a cliff, I'd probably veto it.   My favorite two examples came from the same campaign (same character as well).  Guy was playing a sniper. Our party had 3 .50 cal bullets left. He had a rifle, and we had a machine gun mounted to the back of a humvee. His choices were to shoot the engine block with the rifle or the machine gun. He put all 3 rounds we had through the BFG and missed all three shots.   The next time we had to use it, the sniper had the choice of switching to a different gun (his pistol had run dry) or throwing the gun in his hand at the BBG. He also missed that attack roll and the pistol skidded 30 ft down the corridor."

He would be mute when ever it suited him (aka Shoehorn the story) but when it came to combat or plan making he would always call the shots.   After a few sessions I told him every time he talks out loud (in-game) he would have to roll a d20 for a random demon encounter. Every time he talked I'd add -1 to his roll (stacking of course).    After rolling rolling a 2, and having -12 to the roll, I summoned a Demon titan that murdered their home city and another player. He retconned his character from being mute to just whispering.

rpg,3e2jx7,Dexterous_Baroness,28,Tue Jul 21 16:38:47 2015 UTC,"some silly rules we used to use on a d&d group  1 - The farts  If you fart in real life you also fart in-game.  Also, the world frowns upon farts - they think it is much more disrespectful than in our world. Fart in a social interaction with the king and you may even get arrested.  It reduced the amount of farts, so i guess it worked.  2- The silence   people with voice impediment (metamorphosis, silence spell, trying to be stealthy, gagged, etc) can't speak out of game. good luck trying to mimic something as a wolf, druid.  3 - the constrained movement  If you are constrained (grapple, handcuffed, etc) and must put your hands behind your back.  4- the restroom break  If you go use the restroom, your character will also use it. If he is in a situation that prevents him from going to the restroom, neither can you.  5- The feast  your character will eat and drink whatever you are eating and drinking. Good luck trying to speak to the king while drinking beer.  6- The immersion  To speak out of character you must put your fist over your heart, like in a live game. You cant do this in the middle of a social interaction.  7- The caster handicap  You need to actually make funny movements and rhymes when casting a spell.  It was a directly nerf to me who would always play sorcerers. It was a low magic setting anyway  8- The illusion of epicness   When we feel like it , if you roll a 20 on a skill check you may rol again with a cumulative +20. Same thing with a 1 (roll with a -20). Enjoy the negative or epic skillchecks (we had a incredible funny situation where the bard bluffed and saved us from a sphinx because of it, with like 4 20s in a row.)  9- Creative/unusual solutions give more xp.  I got more experience for killing a beholder by shooting a shrinked tree as an arrow who would turn back into normal size on impact. We didnt have a rule for damage but since he had low hp left it just pierced him through his eye.  10- the chaos  If you roll the dice outside the table, the DM will roll it secretly for you.    Those rules we used on a group that ran for 5 years, but we didnt use them all everytime.  I also had a one-shot adventure with a internet group where you would strike directly to the CON score in a d&d session in case of a critical hit, and rolling a 20 was enough for a critical hit (didnt need to confirm). it was silly and i didnt like pratically one shoting things with a well shot arrow at level 1."
rpg,3e2jx7,GaiusCoffee,15,Tue Jul 21 16:04:07 2015 UTC,"When I DM D&D games(which I haven't done for a while now), I handle out Coward and Courage points whenever they do something that make sense involving being one of those 2 things. They can trade out these points for help figuring out future puzzles, events and problems.  I started doing this because I found out that players(and I DM'd for a lot of people) in D&D would never back down from a fight or a dire situation. They would always assume that if something is happening, it is clearly something they can deal with. I thus created the Coward points, which I could give out whenever I wanted, but would always remind the players that maybe, the answer was not to go forward this time.  As for the Courage points, I added them in ''Good'' games to reward players who would throw themselves in dangers for others. I wanted to reward these players without giving them items, experience or any sort of lead over the rest of the group. So having story ''help'' in the form of Courage Point was the way to go.

Critical failures confirmed by rolling a two 1's in a row become a DM fiat of shit going wrong. So far this had only happened to the players. Stuff like failing an attack during battle and getting your sword lodged in a wall, or trying to do a spot check in a dungeon, failing and walking face first into a gelatinous cube etc...  So as DM running a minor boss fight, a very well set up, intense confrontation between the party and a steampunked lesser dragon who had held a grudge from a previous minor encounter.  Fight begins, baddy attacks first and does big damage with his breath weapon and party goes into ""OH SHIT!"" mode. They attack with everything they've got (and do way more damage than they think) and init comes back around to the baddy. He goes to use an attack that would leave the party blind or temporarily stunned depending on saves. D20 rolls a 1. I roll again to confirm... 1 again. Critical failure.   Baddy's attack cooks off and backfires, he blinds himself. Sigh... Okay could be worse, he's got blind sense after all so the fight's not over just yet.  Party goes through attacks again and baddy's turn comes up again. I change dice, different D20. Try to do a bite attack that nearly cut a player in half. Roll a 1. And just stare down at the dice for a moment. No. Don't you do it. Roll to confirm... 1. Attacks and unhinges his jaw by accident, cant bite any more.   Needless to say the fight was short and the bad guy didn't win. The players still enjoyed the scene though, and thought they just got through by the skin of their teeth.

rpg,3e2e41,trevlix,3,Tue Jul 21 13:04:12 2015 UTC,There is an indie RPG room?  I had no idea!   Edit: proper grammar.
rpg,3e2e41,MilesZS,2,Tue Jul 21 13:15:54 2015 UTC,"I assume so. Its actually called Games on Demand. Link  From what I understand, it works like this. Each GM chooses 2 games that they will potentially run. At the beginning of the session, everyone lines up outside the room and as you enter you choose which table you want. Once a table fills up, its closed.  At your table, the players vote on which game they want to play and thats the game that gets played."
rpg,3e2e41,trevlix,5,Tue Jul 21 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"The way it worked last year was: give over your tickets for a number. Just before the next session starts, they randomly start calling numbers. You walk up to the table, and trade in your number for a place at the game you want to play.   I played a couple games this way last year. There might have been a few GMs running multiple games where you could vote once at their table, but I did not have that experience.  Sometimes the game you want is full, so there's an element of chance. If you only care to play once specific game they have available, you might be disappointed. If you're excited to play nearly anything, you'll have a good time. Last year I played Ryuutama with one of the translators as the GM, and Project: Dark with its creator as the GM. It was a great time."

I've had good experiences there, the only downside is that it has become REALLY REALLY popular so they've had to try different things to make sure people have a fair shot at games.  A couple years back you had to line up really early, and that sucked, so last year there was the lottery system, where you got a number and then hoped your number was called while there were still games you wanted available, etc.  You know they're doing something right if the worst thing about the event is how damned many people want to be part of it, though."

Combat is extremely slow, NPCs are a massive pain to work out because of the way everything runs, and many of the rules openly contradict each other.   The editing is terrible, in all but a few of the most recent books the creator pieced together everything with glue and scissors (Not joking), and many of the rules are just inane, or so complicated when it could just be resolved with a single dice roll for the same result.   I haven't played or GMed it in a while, last game was about a year ago, so I can't give you any specific examples, but hopefully the explanation helped. If you can just handwave a lot of things, and keep the insane power balance in check, then it is actually a lot of fun. If you or your GM can really commit to making something of it, it can be brilliant, but the way it's written, it never will be. There's an official conversion announced recently, changing the system to Savage Worlds, hopefully that will bring some new players to the incredible setting."

Back in the day when you fired micro missiles at something it was roll 100D6, so 100 d6s had to be rolled for one attack. Back then we just used a container to shake them up and each person had a cut of the dice to count but still you got the idea of the time that took up. SDC and MDC I do like a lot however but it's two different scales of damage but pretty much if you have good armor someone who is doing SDC can't hurt you."

SDC, MDC, OCC Skills by percentages, missing on a 1-4 no matter what, different rules for dodge and auto-dodge, the same basic how to role play intro in every game, except with transposed characters appropriate to the lore with the exact same typos."
rpg,3e1it6,Kheldras,3,Tue Jul 21 10:30:51 2015 UTC,I'd argue that SDC and MDC were a good thing since you got a good scale of damage. Nothing like turning a MDC weapon at a human.

I even went to the Palladium open house and even Kevin Siembieda (Owner of Paddium Books and Games) doesn't follow the rules to the letter. Like any role playing game it's fun. But it is not my go to."
rpg,3e1it6,blacksheepcannibal,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"TLDR: There's no ""core mechanic."" Learn the 3 types of checks, and the reasons for them, and RIFTS becomes more simple, and a lot of fun.  When I was 12 years old, on my way to Scout camp, I dropped a bag of garbage off in a public dumpster, and, inside the dumpster, was a brand-new copy of the first edition RIFTS. Some people in the hobby today will tell you I should have left it there, but I feed them to the Xyticix.  My first RPG was Palladium's TMNT, so I was used to the system, but the setting was totally new and awesome. I think most people acknowledge that the mythos and setting for RIFTS is pretty cool, but feel that the system is quite bad.  But it's not. It's an older system, and it can be a bit clunky, but I have a few tips to make it easier. Most new games have a ""core mechanic"" - some simple, universal ""skill check"" to help determine the success of a given action. Palladium games don't have that. They have three:  • The Skill Check • Combat Checks • Saving Throws  There is a glaring omission, and that is something like an ""attribute check"" for stuff like ""Am I strong enough to lift this"" or ""fast enough to catch them"" or ""observant enough to notice that."" I have a house rule for that.  Here's my explanation for each check, and some house rules I add to make it fun.  THE SKILL CHECK: In RIFTS, skills are a percentile, so successfully rolling D100 under the number equals success. There are often some environmental modifiers that affect the number. Also, since there is no such thing as a perfect mastery of a skill, the max skill level is 98%.   So, if you have Climb 98%, but are scaling a slippery surface, while being chased, the GM might add a -30% modifier. If you roll 68% or lower, you succeed.  Simple.   Rifts XP system potentially rewards you more for use of skills than for defeating enemies, (25 XP per skill use, successful or not v. 25-50 xp for defeating a minor foe), and, by the end of character creation, you will have all kinds of skills, like herbology, demolitions, and dance. Use the skills as much as possible, not just for XP rewards, but for fun roleplaying as well.  My house rule on skills, is that any time a skill is used, I have the player increase it by 1%. I omit the automatic +5% at level up, so the skills you regularly use, you improve upon. Got that idea from The Elder Scrolls.  THE COMBAT CHECK: Combat is more complex in RIFTS than in other games, and I think it is more fun. Can also take a bit longer, but for me, it is the perfect combination of tactics and cinematics. There are two main things that set RIFTS combat apart: Number of Attacks per round, and Active Defense.  Palladium was my first system, so when I tried systems that didn’t have these options, I found them lacking. I like the attacks per melee (round). An untrained NPC can get of one (effective) attack per melee round (15 second). Most PCs start with two. If you are trained in some type of hand-to-hand combat, you’ll likely end up with four. Then, some skills or racial abilities will add more than that. Anything over four, and you will be doing serious damage in combat. The official rules suggest that, after determining initiative, you go back and forth between characters, until the character with fewer attacks has to stop. Then, the character with more attacks can rattle off the last few attacks, once the slower character runs out. Sometimes I will permit the character with more attacks to evenly distribute his attacks throughout the melee. GMs call.  Active defense means that on a successful attack roll, you get to decide what defense your character takes. I like this better. In DND, a fast character was rewarded with more armor class, making them more difficult to hit. I like being able to decide what my character does. So, if my opponent successfully throws a punch, I can choose to block (parry) or dodge. Most hand-to-hand skills permit an “automatic parry.” That is a confusing term, because it doesn’t mean you automatically succeed, it just means that choosing to parry doesn’t use one of your attacks (actions). Most of the time, dodging requires an action. This leads to some silliness, because you can opt to “dodge” a bullet. I don’t see it as actually dodging it. I see it as staying in cover (thus costing you an action).  Active defense is cool, though, because it really helps you picture what is happening, leaving less description to the GM, and making you a more active participant in the combat narrative. Also, as you get to higher levels in your H2H skill, there are often some cool, combination dodge/attack moves you can do.  Finally, there are SAVING THROWS: There is a table hidden somewhere in that vast tome (All saves can be found on page 346 of RUE.), that define what the saving throws are for various dangers. You roll a 20-sided die, add your modifier, try to get lower than the save.  I know this is already long, but, I'll add one more house rule for the ATTRIBUTE CHECK. Attributes, for the most part, are determined by rolling 3D6, so range between 3-18. After skill and race/occupation bonuses, they usually end up between 10-25. To make a check, I apply a modifier, and ask my players to roll under their attribute (similar to a saving throw). Characters with exceptional attributes (Physical Strength over 30, for example) will still usually succeed on most checks. Seems realistic to me.  Hopefully those explanations help you enjoy the game. I love it. Have fun!  TLDR: There's no ""core mechanic."" Learn the 3 types of checks, and the reasons for them, and RIFTS becomes more simple, and a lot of fun."

So a game system that is clunky, out-of-date, with un-intuitive mechanics is only a good game if no game is out that can do it any better."
rpg,3e1it6,Ell975,17,Tue Jul 21 17:50:27 2015 UTC,"Technically I didn't GM it, but Eclipse Phase was a bit of a nightmare to run a campaign in even if it was only several sessions long. Your body (morph) determines your primary stats almost entirely and those in conjunction with your actual character are used to calculate your several dozen skills using different formulas you just need to memorize (but always involved adding at least three things and often also required multiplication along the way). Changing your gear, morph or taking wounds had effects on the different skills to different degrees. We had a huge and very complicated excel sheet (one per character) to help us keep track of all of that. So not so bad, right?  Wrong. Hacking, using the net, personal assistant AIs, morph making and a whole bunch of other things had their own individual systems that worked in different ways. We never even got a chance to look at half of them but you needed to know them all to GM the system effectively.  Not to mention there was very little actual connection between skills. I played a neurosurgeon/morph maker/geneticist (I was thinking mad scientist with an emphasis on creating fantastical creatures) that could make creatures from scratch but couldn't bind a wound or set a bone."
rpg,3e1it6,DrunkColdStone,4,Tue Jul 21 09:59:40 2015 UTC,"What? The game is supposed to be about how the body isn't important, just like a set of clothes to change out of and yet the rules make changing morph a nightmare? No wonder friends warned me off the system."
rpg,3e1it6,Andere,6,Tue Jul 21 13:29:09 2015 UTC,The setting flavour is that changing bodies is relatively easy but the mechanics make it a huge pain. If you switch between bodies of the same model nothing much changes but as soon as you change models (and there is quite the variety to choose from) you have to recalculate every single one of your many many skills. Also being good at something is more about being in a body that is good at it than your character's intrinsic skills. Your intrinsic knowledge is what pushes you from very good to great but a civilian in a super soldier body will wipe the floor with a veteran soldier in a baseline human body.

I can't tell, parts of this read like The Neverending Story, wherein the world is made during the act of playing the game.  Other parts read like a weird meta-joke about gaming in general.  Other parts make it seem like the game is a game about playing the game itself.  I don't think I'm high enough to understand this, but I kind of want to try.  Here are a few of the... interesting quotes I found in the book.   The meaning of the story sometimes kind of gallops past you like a cowboy on the back of an overcharged ur-toad, so it's good to keep a wary eye out and hope you'll find out what it is.   Thanks for that delightful imagery.   If you still cannot come to a consensus on how to resolve rules disputes, you are no longer playing WTF. God knows what you're playing. Probably Hybrid.   Still a better game than Hybrid.   The author has a strong sense of what you're supposed to be doing when you play WTF. That said — you can't read her mind. It’s protected by the fundamental isolation of personhood and the unbridgeable divide between soul and soul!   Okay, so you aren't going to clarify what any of this means?   It turns out that the world doesn't exist anyway. It's made of Prameya or quantum foam or something. You have lost WTF. Anyway, if you DEFY THE CLEARLY WRITTEN RULES and ARE STILL WINNING, that's as good a place as any to end Book 2.   Wait, what?   You may encounter the dragons of the deeps when you are not aware that you are playing; then you will turn around and realize that you were playing WTF all along.   Note that the book never defines what a ""dragon of the deep"" is, and directly contradicts itself on what ur-toads might be.  There are 6 cardinal directions, plus areas above and below the world.  Oh yeah, the stuff about planets and donuts and mandela and flow charts and prameya and all that rot?  Never explained or put in anything resembling context.  No idea how to use it for actual play, it's just there.  The example of play starting on page 86 is hilarious.  I don't even have any words for it.  This game is amazing.

To be honest, it was just... We did CharGen, which took fucking hours to get the math right. Seriously try to minimize the possibility of an NPC interacting with players beyond basic exposition because stats are retardedly hard to make up, just cookie-cutter everything. Tried to get through a basic story about some bandits who raided a village. The multiple rapes are funny to talk about, afterwards, with people who weren't there, because everyone who was there remember it was the most boring forced action atrocity to resolve. The combat, aside from the rape (which is a big aside), is clunky if you cut out most of it. It can take ages to resolve the most simple of encounters if you have anything magical at all involved and no one at the table thought to value the benefits of an action versus the labour of resolving it, because seriously fuck the rogue for wanting to be sneaky.

rpg,3e1it6,anothga,12,Tue Jul 21 14:02:57 2015 UTC,"1) Yes, its a bitch for how often rape can happen, you may want to pre-roll it up, though certain factors can adjust it at some weird point in the equation which means it bizarrely shrinks or grows. The math is broken and you need to do this every time anal insertion comesup, which is a lot if you didn't remember during chargen to make sure you could easily resist rape urges.   THAT IS A FUCKING THING, THAT YOU HAVE TO STAT AGAINST A FORCED REACTIO  TO RAPE A PERSON UPON ENCOUNTERING THEM AND EVERY ROUND IN COMBAT.  2) We did this over a long weekend as a sort of dare, on Monday as the sun was falling we ritually burnt all the paper involved, reformatted all hard drives that came into contact with the pdfs and dumped the ashes into the sea. We didn't say much, some of us actually took showers to physically scrub ourselves To cleanse that horrible experience.   THIS IS A GAME THAT WILL MAKE ANY RATIONAL MINDED PERSON FEEL UNCLEAN.  3) At first, the idea of doing the impossible was europhoric, it got shot down fast. There is no fun if you try to play it with intent of telling a story or experiencing the wonder of adventure; between being one of the most disgusting texts it is also very bad with crunch. I can't look at 2 different PC's sheets who are at the same level and tell which is better optimized. You can't at a glance do anything. Pointless exceptions exist for everything. Even the stuff you would think would be woeth a chuckle like the rape rolls, it drags out so much you can't feel any perversion from it, it comes off sickening because you look up at the rest of the group after spending 5-10 minutes doing math purely so your character commits rape on another character, which you may not have wanted to do in the first place, say instead wanting to ask directions. You sit and askyourself ""I just did an exam on advanced algebra with some quadratics thrown in because I'm meant to find rape enjoyable and need to have mathematical representation that has no reference to reality"".  If its not the thoroughly foul nature of it, its the garbage amount of effort to a basic action that the game will frequently force on you.

rpg,3e1it6,Rhev,5,Tue Jul 21 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"I recall Alternity having a rather slow system involving tables for most of your attacks. There were 3 levels of success you could have with any given weapon attack, and 3 different pools of hitpoints. Though nothing as simple as one pool being assigned to each level of success. The dice you rolled for damage often completely changed in each success bin, so there was no good way of anticipating what die you'd roll next if you succeeded on an attack. Advantage/disadvantage of rolls was in the form of a large graded slider with the die hierarchy ranked by average value. Everything took forever.  On the plus side, they released a StarCraft boxset that was kind of neat.  Edit: Added images"

That being said, there were plenty of clone systems like this through the 80s - though I think many of them died in the 90s.

There's just too much going on and to keep track of. Gear, Spirit bonding, how much this costs, and who has to buy it, but hold on, you forgot to remember this from this chart! It's cluttered and confusing.  2) Gear. WAY TO MUCH GEAR. Instead of providing a structure of tech to pull from and innovate on the fly, they provide every single thing that you could possibly or possibly not buy in the whole world.  3) Inclusion of stats to things that the PC's shouldn't really ever have access to. Like Military grade tec. In lore, if someone has Mil-Spec armor, it's the equivalent to someone driving a tank down main street. It's hard to hide, hard to use, and if someone is actually caught with it, it's not like today's society where they will politely ask you to stop blowing stuff up with the tank. The head corporation will drop a bomb on you, and claim the rebuilding of that portion of the city on their tax returns.  4) Spirits and Magic. It's a headache. It's complicated. And there's no good way to measure effectiveness until Street Grimoire was released. It's a steaming heap of awful and it's a pain in the neck to play and memorize.  5) It's specific enough to be vague. We statted exactly how many magic user there are in the world, the number of bolts you'd find in a gun, but that ONE rule that you really need to know? Yeah it's not on the page that we said it's on. Actually, it's not in the book at all. Good luck!  6) Rules lawyers love it. See above. It's just specific enough to be vague on many many issues. Which allows people to pick and choose how they interpret it. I can't remember how many times i had to argue with my players over on /r/runnerhub or /r/shadownet because of one thing that boosted them ridiculously didn't work that way specifically because it broke the game. It also allowed GM's to get mean with people. ""Oh look, he's getting too powerful with a rule we completely missed. Well, since it's just an interpretation and i have a problem with that guy, let's give an official ruling on how it works against him. YAY!""

Epic 4E is a slog, which is massively unfortunate because it had no reason to be other than the devs just didn't really know what they were doing. There are also other problems as well, but that's the one with the most dramatic effects at the table.  Also, DnD 4E is one of the few games I ran, and technically the thread was about what you've run. I've read and played worse games than 4E, but not actually run that many. Call of Cthulhu actually comes in a close second given how clunky the d100 is as a randomizer and how arcane and arbitrary the SAN rules are. Reading the Necronomicon never actually drove anyone crazy in the stories, it was learning that the things in the book were TRUE that usually unnerved people.  If we take the ""running"" qualifier out of the running, pretty much all editions DnD save maybe Basic (since it's the only one I haven't read) are usually their own special kinds of messes. I love nothing more than watching a game grind to a halt as a player and the GM argue about this obscure property of that obscure spell and I have to go onto the SRD to resove it for them. Shadowrun 4E is also hugely complicated with a massive open-ended character creation system and really complex rules. Firing a gun twice in a round can call in something like four or five situational negative modifiers depending on when and how you do it.   As for what games I run now: None currently. I ran a game in the World of Darkness setting using a half-finished homebrew system a friend of mine made recently, but that was a oneshot. I haven't run a game regularly in years.

Obviously you would have to hack it to fit the setting, or find an existing hack you liked.   You might also look at Age of Arthur.

rpg,3e1p0p,dytianquin,11,Tue Jul 21 07:29:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're on the right track. Lady Blackbird and Dungeon World are excellent choices. (Fiasco, Dread, and Everyone is John would also be good choices.)  Sometimes novice players just want a railroad. They've gotten used to quest pointers in skyrim. They're not used to improvising.  Try this:  Instead of asking them what setting they want, ask them what movies they like.  Instead of asking what kind of character they want to make, ask them who's their favorite fictional character.  For your first one-shot, consider using pregen characters.  When you get into the game, ask pointed, loaded, direct questions. Save the open-ended questions for later.  Example:   ""You're all in a vehicle together. It's being chased. You're driving at top speed. You just crossed the city limits.""   ""Are you going into the city, or away?"" ""What's under the blanket?"" ""Who's chasing you?""   If they answer those questions well and the scene goes well, consider asking more open-ended questions.   ""Fighter.. who did you look up to at the academy? What caused their horrible, untimely death?"" ""Healer.. why were you excommunicated? How did you get your revenge?"" ""Bard.. what happened to make you flee the last city?"" ""Wizard.. You've heard the Bard's story. What really happened?"""

I looked into Dread, but I don't have Jenga, so I'd have to get that first if I choose to play that game.   That's honestly some great advice. The questions I was thinking of asking were more open-ended since a lot of people kept saying to ask questions that give more possibilities to the player. I forgot to consider that I might need to give the players a bit more of a direction for the first few sessions with my questions, so they can get into the swing of things."
rpg,3e1p0p,plexsoup,5,Tue Jul 21 08:15:51 2015 UTC,Everyone is John is a game where players get to play voices in John's head. (Mental illness is hilarious.)  Players each have competing goals for John and they vie for control through willpower tests.  Here's a variant: Everyone is Joker
rpg,3e1p0p,plexsoup,3,Tue Jul 21 08:30:37 2015 UTC,"Everyone is Joker seems to be awesome to me. I might use that variant for an awesome one-shot for the players. It sounds like it'd be a whole lot of fun if people get into the spirit of the game.  By the way, I was reading the description of James D'Amato, and I looked on the word Kobold. I hear that name thrown around in forums and whatnot, but I'm not exactly sure. Is it a publishing company for roleplaying books?"
rpg,3e1p0p,Almeidaboo,3,Tue Jul 21 08:55:31 2015 UTC,No idea:   Kobolds are fictitious reptilian humanoids. Kobolds ate my Baby is an RPG. I've never played it. Kobold Press is a company that made some Pathfinder supplements. Sage Kobold is the name of the publishing company that released Dungeon World. It was named after the cofounders Sage Latorra and Adam Koebel. Adam Koebel is a guy who co-wrote Dungeon World and now works for Roll20.net running games. He's done a bunch of stuff with RollPlay (itmejp) as well.
rpg,3e1p0p,MadxDogz,2,Tue Jul 21 09:09:04 2015 UTC,This is some excelent advice! Congrats man!
rpg,3e1p0p,mirtos,3,Tue Jul 21 11:08:56 2015 UTC,"Hey man, just reading your story is awesome and I hope you're able to get your friends as invested into role playing games as you are. I've been in your position a number of times (I'm basically the only one who reads ahead on systems and actually knows how to play with every group I've been in).   I did a lot of what you did, that is, reading up on how to GM and ideas and what not. Taking notes, etc and it definitely helps. But I will say the only way to get better is through experience and not to worry if you're doing a good job, because you probably are. I know a lot of times I was worried that people maybe didn't like the game but it was just me doubting myself. Now onto the system.   I love the Apocalypse World system. If you're going to introduce new people to roleplaying, this is what I would use. I've done DnD with new people before. Even people who have role played before. It turns into you creating their character for them if they're not invested. After running Dungeon World, I never want to run any other fantasy system unless it's like Burning Wheel or something and everyone is a hardcore rules-reader like me (I pray for the day that happens).   I actually just had the pleasure of being able to run Apocalypse World for the first time after like three years of reading and rereading the rule book and it was a great learning experience. I would definitely say Apocalypse World is more difficult of a game for ""newer"" players to get into than say Dungeon World simply because of how much Apoc World expects characters to put effort into investing themselves into the story. Dungeon World will definitely allow you as the GM to kind of force a story if necessary, as it still has a lot of the high fantasy DnD tropes to rely on. In truth, I would ask your friends what sort of setting they're interested in, and the suggestion to ask about their favorite movies is great advice. Having inspired players that WANT to be a part of the world you're making will basically do your job for you, as opposed to having to make up reasons for why your players should get invested if they're just playing because everyone else is. Sorry if this rant got out of hand. I just love to see new GMs trying to get their friends to play because it reminds me so much of my struggles to get people to fall in love with RPGs like I have lol."
rpg,3e1p0p,MadxDogz,3,Tue Jul 21 12:32:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of respect to you man. I just think it's polite and respectful to everyone on the table to take some time to understand the game you're playing. You don't have to know absolutely everything, but at the very least, know the concept, so you're not completely lost. For example, I don't like spending an hour or two trying to explain the rules of the game for board game night.  I'm kinda struggling with getting the players invested. Two people seem interested in doing it, but the others are kinda just in it because the three of us want to try it out. The other two who are interested are completely new and don't really know what they want to do, so even if I try to ask, I don't get much out of them. It's unfortunate, but that's life. I just hope that I meet some people, or make new friends that are really into this hobby, so I can finally have some fun roleplaying.  I've been thinking of joining a group on roll2o, but my schedule is a bit erratic and the time differences really prevent me from trying it. I'm trying to see what i can do though.  Thanks for what you've said. It's really encouraging, and I don't mind reading. After all, I've gone through thousands of pages of books this week."
rpg,3e1p0p,neithrantulre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:35 2015 UTC,"you could always start with just the two who are really interested.    i grew up in a very small town (not in the middle east, so i had more access to the actual games) and few friends who were actually into roleplaying.  We used to have one DM and one or 2 players.  Its doable.  Obviously its more fun with more players.    If you feel, for example, you need a party of four characters for the little adventure, and you have only 2 players that really want to try it out, you can either let them each play 2 characters (not my suggestion), or let them play one character each, and play the 2 other people in the party as NPCs (just make sure that if you do so, let the ""main"" characters get most of the spotlight).  Its extra work on you as a GM but it can still be fun."
rpg,3e1p0p,neithrantulre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words. If you already have players getting good board game time in, I don't think you'll have too much issue transitioning to roleplaying games as long as you have people who enjoy creating. In regards to players who aren't that interested, I feel the need to comment again because I just experienced the exact same situation you've been in when I got to run that Apocalypse World campaign. Two players who had some degree of experience with roleplaying/video games, and two players who were the opposite. In part some of it was my fault for springing Apocalypse World onto the players without doing a thorough job making sure everyone was ok to play it, but I just have so much love for the system and I feel a lot of that carried over.   So my advice to you is if your players aren't giving you a preference, pick a system that really interests you, so that your enthusiasm and desire to play will be infectious. My first session of Apocalypse World wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. In part because I was a bit overloaded with running this system for the first time, but also because I was too worried about playing the game ""right"" instead of ""being a fan"" of the characters like the rulebook itself says. This is something I fixed in the second session, where those people who were less interested, I made their lives interesting and really made them feel like the ""heroes"" of the story, which is what I should have been doing all along. Even if you don't plan to play Apocalypse World, I really recommend just reading through the Master of Ceremonies section, because that information is just great GMing advice no matter what game you're playing."

rpg,3e1p0p,plexsoup,2,Tue Jul 21 07:39:06 2015 UTC,"The only rules-light system I've used is Risus. Not a bad system but it can get kinda silly.

Because of players trying to do stuff like that, I tend to stick to the more rules-heavy systems."
rpg,3e1p0p,AndrewTBP,2,Tue Jul 21 07:42:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't put Risus in there because I thought that things like that could happen. I'm not against using rules heavy systems, but I'm thinking about the players and how they'd handle a more rules heavy system. Character creation might be a complete nightmare for me if I'm going to use a rules heavy system, so I might just give them pregenerated characters if I go with D&D or Pathfinder.  I don't think they'd be into the idea much if I make them read a huge book just to create a character."

(Basically, roll all the dice for the cliche and take the highest dice instead of adding them up.)  Don't worry too much if things get silly. That's not a bad way to introduce players to rollplaying. If they can laugh, they won't feel so nervous about improvising."

rpg,3e1srx,mirtos,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:37 2015 UTC,"The hardest, for me, is the rollplaying stuff. Followed by trying to get them out of the murderhoboism mindset. The murderhobo thing comes from the whole ""EXP for killing"" stuff and players just focusing on advancement, because this is the only real way to progress in DnD.   The rollplaying stuff comes, I think, from bad GM's trying to fuck over players.     Example: GM: You enter the corridor and ... Volker: <rolls dice, before asked> WHAT DO I FIND?!   For me, as a more narrative driven GM, this breaks my flow. I ask for rolls, or you ask for a roll and we decide as a group what happens. Don't just roll dice and ask what happens! The shit you want to happen could also happen without rolling dice!   State what you want to do and how you try to achieve it, then we look at dice, IF we need them. Not ""I ROLL SEARCH! <rolls dice>"" because that makes me mad."
rpg,3e1srx,Stranger371,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:30 2015 UTC,"This ended up being a long post.  Yes.  this is the ""rollplay"" vs ""roleplay"" argument.  And I dont disagree that its annoying, and this has been a discussion on roleplaying forumns for quite some time.  I remember having this very argument over 20 years ago, on bulletin boards in the early 90s.  I would imagine its been going on longer than that, but in the 80s i lived in a small town.  Rollplaying is a term that is actually insulting people whose style of play is more the hack & slash game.  And I prefer story-developed, character-developed games, but its actually a completely valid game style.  The problem is when you start a group you have to find like-minded people.  I dont think its the fault of any one system.  Some people just dont care about characters and story.  I think they are missing out, but ive learned over the years that you cant make people love story.    Its also become more and more prevalent with video games (which i love), but people are used to just immediately getting the gold, or whatever, when they kill their opponents.    I will admit with all the rules of D&D (and other systems that are even more heavy, like GURPS), you're going to find more of these style of gamers than you would in a light system such as FATE or a no-system like Dread.  But i dont think it comes from bad dms trying to fuck over players.  I dont think it helps, mind you.  The murderhobo thing does drive me mad, and thats one of the faults f D&D, no argument.  There have been times when it was better.  For example, at very times during first edition, when you get the experience for the kill, 2nd edition introduced story awards and awards for doing things appropriate to your class.  Clerics would get experience for healing, Thieves (as they were called in that edition) for stealing, Wizards for researching new spells (back when researching spells or creating magic items wasnt so mechanic driven).    I get around that by the idea that was once presented in 3rd edition (which with its CR had a good idea that you dont get XP for killing things beneath you), that instead of experience per kill, figure a person should level every n sessions (whatever n is).  So they would get similar experience for a session that had 13 combats and one that was all roleplay.  These were all variant rules, mind you.  I wish they had stayed.  People would get experience and level up every so often, and they would enjoy the game more, rather than waiting for the next thing to kill.  Very easy to do as a DM, by the way.  The funny thing, in my opinion, and i like 3.0/3.5 and pathfinder, they're fun, but they are the ones that introduced these crazy rule after rule after rule.  D&D used to be simple.  The original D&D?  Very simple.  Much more simple than even the simplest of games out now (except perhaps a few).  It also left a lot more up to story and the mind of the DM?  Remember early 2nd edition magic creation?  There werent complicated rules for it.  It was all esoteric things up to the DM.  There were crazy tables for fun, but it was things like ""breath of the dragon"" and ""blood of the wind"".  You made quests out of things like that.  Somewhere along the way, people wanted more rules.  I liked the concept of the classes being able to mix, so you could create the character you had in your mind.  It was a definite improvement over wizards are wizards, and fighters are fighters.  But that led to min/maxing, for those that would.  Originally PRestige classes were supposed to be about the campaign world.  they even said that when it came out.  Eventually all the splat books came out and players expected prestige classes.  Is it the systems fault?  Or is it the type of player?  A little of both, I think.  Powergamers are always going to want to powergame.  Storytellers are always going to want to storytell.  Both will take advantage of a system to be able to do what they want, to play the type of game they enjoy.   TL;DR: its really about the type of gamer and what they play.  also the complaints about D&D being too heavy are actually much more about 3.0/pathfinder era than the older game."
rpg,3e1srx,mirtos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:11 2015 UTC,One of the bad habits is the DM being and adversarial role as opposed to an antagonist.  An adversary is trying screw over the characters.  The antagonist is trying to get the characters to grow and change. If your new to the genre it's easy to see being difficult to the players. Keep in mind that I haven't played 4e or 5e so my interpretation could be very outdated.  Dungeon World or any system that's built on Apocalypse World hammers in being a fan of players.  It has good DM advice built into the system. It gives an excellent framework for planning games and allowing a group narrative.
rpg,3e1srx,Spooon6t9,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:54 2015 UTC,"I've seen that a lot in different systems.  I dont think thats a fault of D&D, but a fault of bad DMs.  I think a lot of DMs confuse creating challenges with trying to ""beat"" the players.  Even in the 70s, the role of the DM was always meant to challenge and grow the characters.  at least in good games.    ill have to dig out my old books, but even then they talked about the role of the DM.  i think part of this stems from the old ""role player vs roll player"" arguments though.   Dont get me wrong, there are a lot of things i dislike about D&D (havent played 5th edition), and the main reason ive stuck with it isnt because i like it more than the others but its usually been when finding a new group of players (im the perpetual DM) to play in my world (homebrew), D&D is the system they tend to have been more familiar with.    One of my complaints about the more modern D&D (3.0 and above, again, havent played 5th, and didnt like 4th), is that they are too ""rulesy"" and that leads players and DMs into the trap of thinking ""well, if it isnt in the rules, then it cant be done"", and it stiffles innovative thinking.  (a good DM allows creative things, even if it doesnt always follow the rules, in my opinion)."

Since literally everything but damage is 2d6+whatever it's easy for people to learn and easy to run. It also requires no prep on the part of the GM at all if they can improvise even a little. I've started every game of it I've run just by asking the players questions until we had enough information about what situation they're in and going from there.  It's a nice way to get into roleplaying games, and if they decide they want something crunchier there's nothing stopping them from grabbing some version of D&D or whatever."
rpg,3e1srx,aholeinyourbackyard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:14 2015 UTC,"i think thats a valid argument to stay away from D&D, though, i think 5e is pretty basic, and I've heard the starter set is one of the better starter sets.  To be fair, I havent played 5e yet.  one of the advantages (and maybe the only advantage) of D&D is that its the most mainstream, and thus if you're starting out, its going to be a lot simpler to find a D&D group.  This can be important for people in small towns, etc.  Obviously, this is less important than it was say 12 years ago because the internet makes it easier to play online, and find groups if you dont have local groups.  Of course, if the entire group is starting out, thats a different story.    Then I would start with the simplest system that allows you to simply tell the story."
rpg,3e1srx,mirtos,0,Tue Jul 21 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"I love Savage Worlds because of its simplicity. Since literally everything but damage is  ability die+wild die vs TN 4 whatever it's easy for people to learn and easy to run. It also requires no prep on the part of the GM at all if they can improvise even a little. I've started every game of it I've run just by asking the players questions until we had enough information about what situation they're in and going from there.  It's a nice way to get into roleplaying games, and if they decide they want something crunchier there's nothing stopping them from grabbing some version of D&D or whatever.  ;D"

rpg,3e1srx,PrimarchtheMage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:34:14 2015 UTC,"There are lots of systems out there. I'd find one that interests your group and go from there. Obviously things like D&D are very good gateways, but not everyone enjoys fantasy.   As far as learning how to play, really, only 1 person really needs to know how to play. And that is the DM. It is useful for the players to learn the rules because it can really help you create the character you want, but it is not required and between the book and someone who does know the rules, you can figure out how to make most anything you want to do work.  But usually play sessions revolve around the DM creating scenarios for the players and then ask how they want to resolve it.   You're walking down a street when you notice 3 shadowy figures start to tail you. As a player you can then say, I turn around to fight them, or I turn around to talk with them, or even, I start to run away. Then the DM will have you make appropriate checks based on your actions. Fighting them would be combat, talking with them may include things like bluffing or diplomacy. Running may go into your acrobatics if people or things start to get in your way. None of these are necessarily wrong which is the true beauty of an RP.   But that is RPing on the simplest of levels. Ultimately, you are working with others to write a story.   As for getting a game together, its often the hardest part. I talk with my group to find a date and time that works for everyone and we've been lucky to find a weeknight where everyone can play. But everyone's schedule is different and finding enough time to fit in a play session which are often at least 3-4 hours can be difficult.   Still, I wish you the best of luck with everything. The hobby is a lot of fun. Especially with the right group."
rpg,3e1srx,Haen_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:37:44 2015 UTC,"First off, figure out what you and your friends are wanting to play. The easiest route is fantasy - everybody is familiar with it, everybody understands how it works. Find a good beginner game with this genre. Personally, I think D&D - even 5e - are terrible beginner games. I'd stick with Dungeon World or Savage World. Look up info on both systems to figure out which you would rather have.  Second off, somebody is going to have to be the GM. This person will put way, way more time and effort into the game than anybody else, and will need to be imaginative and creative more often. In return, they'll have ultimate say on what goes and what doesn't in the world, and will be the primary source of plot in the game (but not the only one).  After that, the GM learns as much as they can about the rules, teaches it to other players, all the players make a character, and you guys set off on awesome and imaginative adventures that often-times lead to lots of fun and stories you tell people for years to come."

I still remember my friends starting to play, and learning the rules as a player is difficult enough; our GM learning the rules at the same time was... I'll charitably go with ""interesting"".  Go on Google and find a game store near you.  They almost always have a bulletin board available for people to post about games that need players.  Many will have space in the store to play games, and you may be able to find a pickup game right there.  Alternately, find a living world-type game that you can join. They are almost always set up for consistency, which itself provides a certain level of simplicity, and they are always welcoming new players.

My group learned from reading the players handbook, and I learned to DM from reading the guides, as well as watching the Rollplay series by itmejp, and the DM series Being Everything Else Here and Here.   You can also find games at local gaming stores. You'd probably have to search in your area, but a lot of board game, comic book or magic the gathering stores also do rollplay nights.

Mouse sized critter, yes a regular web will hinder movement if you are talking about a full web and not just individual strands. Outside a few of the larger spiders or more prolific spinners anything larger than a small rat will be at best annoyed but otherwise unhindered by a web. Some spiders can produce webs large enough to hinder or even catch something the size of a rat but they aren't that common.   = Is regular web strong enough to hold a mouse-sized critter suspended in the air?   Yep [KIWF]   = What would be a good way to use spider web globules or web-infused tools as grappling hooks or immobilizer tools?   A few strands of web woven into a rope would work. The stickiness would need to be removed for any silk tool to be useful as the web is as likely to stick to itself as any target.   = Is there something that could cover web and render it un-sticky, but quickly shed away for deployment (say, a glob of carefully gathered web at the end of the rope, covered in lacque -- safe when carefully covered in a steel box, but quickly cracks and sticks to whatever it can on impact)?   Not really. The stickiness of a web is due to the application of an additional glue like substance. This substance could be harvested from webs and stored in a container and applied to a weapon. Do be aware however that this substance has some interesting properties of its own, namely its function depends on the speed at which the target strikes the globule. At low speeds it will stick but at high speeds it acts more like rubber, stiff and bouncy. It is also electrically conductive and will be attracted to an object with a static charge.   = How can you remove yourself from the web quickly?   At mouse size a mouse size knife is your best bet. Afterwards water or saliva or just a bath in general will remove any traces."

Is regular web strong enough to hold a mouse-sized critter suspended in the air?   Depends on the web. If it's a densely made web it could do so, that's assuming it's acting as a net. I wouldn't think the stickiness would hinder a mouse.   What would be a good way to use spider web globules or web-infused tools as grappling hooks or immobilizer tools?   I'd use it wherever you want something better than rope, it could be woven into fabric as well. We don't use spidersilk because we would need so much more silk for it to be useful, mice however would need less and would thefore make better use of it. Also, not all silk is sticky, the spider uses two types of silk for making webs, it travels via the unsticky threads but catches creatures with the syicky threads.  Unsure about the globules and removing yourself from the web."

It's like a cellophane film: you can tear it easily, because it's so thin, but once you're wrapped in several layers of it, and in a way that restricts your movements, it becomes much much harder.  Add to this that some spiders can secrete glue with their silk to entrave their prey even more, and “regular” web becomes quite threatening actually ;)"

Animal wise you've got bears.  You could also potentially encounter diseased water sources, or plague carrying animals in the area. Soil that is too poisoned to grow anything.

Overcasting was already a part of RoleMaster 2. I think that it was mentioned in RMC II, along with a discussion on how many powerpoints multipliers and adders gave extra.  Arguably, the metamagic feats in D&D 3.0 / 3.5 / Pathfinder allow you to 'overcharge' too - Empower, Maximize, and even Heighten all change the result of a spell being cast.  In Wizardry: Bane of the Cosmic Forge you could also overcharge through spending more spell points.  Fatigue has been a part of the Dragonlance franchise from the word go. It's been part of the computer games, the various roleplaying games, and the lore.  Fatigue has also been a part of Ars Magica (at least 4th edition) and Shadowrun (all editions), and the Corruption mechanic is part of MERP (all editions), while an optional Fatigue mechanic was discussed in RM: Spell Law. And that's off the top of my head.  The Bard's Tale games had spells that arguably changed with syllables. Rune magic has been a part of many roleplaying systems - though the best system I've seen for a multi-syllable kind of thing was in GURPS Magic. The one that dynamically implements this kind of thing best might be Spellbinder."

IE: you can do whatever you want, be whatever you want, have whatever skills you want, as long as you spend the points. Oh, but you can't have Fireball without at least 3 other fire spells first, so all fire mages have pretty much identical spellbooks. There is a precedent for ""prerequisite skills"" in other areas of the game, but magic is the only place you find 6 or 7 prerequisites for the only spell you actually wanted in the first place.

Bear in mind the system we use is a bastardization of d&d3.5  While exploring, the pcs can find mithical gems that are changing colors, and when they ""activate"" it, they choose a color to stop it on. Then I (the gm) come up with a power/magic that corrisponds to the gem. The more unique the color, the more unique the power.  For example, if they chose green Id let them have a grass/plant based power, like being able to grow vines on any surface for them to use how they want. If they chose medical green id give them some sprt of healing power.  Another example would be like silver would give them metal minipulation, but to make it less op, they have to be touching the metal.  The gem based magic allows players to be less locked into ""the rules"" or ""what the book says."" They have mana, witch Imake them role 4d6+int/wiz modifier(they can choose) to each.  Then depending on the scale of the move, take out a cirtain amount of mana. They can use more that their total amount of mana, but if they go to -10 they are knocked unconsous.  This is just what ive done for our groups bullshit system, as all of us are lazy and would rather invent rules based on our own thoughts then actually learn how to play, that in mind, it allows for more unique magics than what the books provide."

Stun damage is the same type of damage dealt when you get punched, poisoned by knockout gas, or exhausted by running, so it's basically limited by fatigue.  Second, as an addon to this, mages have a maximum force they can cast spells based on how powerful their magic is. However, they can overcast by up to double their magic rating, but at the cost of turning that stun damage into lethal damage, the same kind you get from being shot or stabbed.

The setting is something like this: some evil mastermind villain figures out how to cause and/or direct a hurricane, and sabotages city infrastructure over a long time.

Not really familiar with those except for exactly one WoD one-shot I played, but those iirc only require rolling a set number of dice and counting how many got a ""10"" or higher.   That way there aren't any modifiers involved, and even if there are, it's added onto how many dice are rolled, so you don't have to do the math in your head.   WoD also leans a lot more on the roleplaying imagination side, iirc. Once the character sheet is set up, there shouldn't be a lot of math involved other than counting.

rpg,3dz9h6,myripyro,16,Tue Jul 21 01:05:42 2015 UTC,"To take a different track ask your players to describe places or events. When the group enters a new city for example give them just the highlights, such as it is filled with towering spires flying the kings banner, then ask them what catches their character's eyes, or what is the first place the key in on. This takes pressure off you as a GM to fill in all the blanks and helps to add unexpected flavor to people and places. Of course this works better with some games than others.   With games Powered by the Apocalypse, you can have the players virtually write all the sites and NPCs. In D&D there are times when you will need to take the reigns, particularity around NPCs with numbers under them.     If this style of GMing is appealing to you, practice how you ask questions. If a character is investigating a murder, you can ask them questions like what make's you think the victim's throat was slit? This puts the player in charge of describing what they say that let them to this conclusion. (A crafty GM might ask questions like this when the character fails their rolls, leading the PCs in the wrong direction.)"

How long are we talking here?   I think this is probably something that's really obvious to you, because you know you're thinking furiously and trying to put words to things in your imagination. The players probably don't notice the pauses as much as you do.   My first instinct is to say, ""Don't orate."" An oration is a formal speech. Games are not formal. I mean, if the King needs to give a speech, ok, maybe have a speech planned in advance and deliver the shit out of it, if you can, but otherwise this shouldn't be a big formal thing. I'm probably just being pedantic, saying this, but just in case.   Personally I aim to not talk for more than about 10-20 seconds at a time. I always want to be throwing the ball back at the players, asking them what they do. Because a long monologue from the DM isn't going to embarrass the players, even if you say 'UM' a lot, but it might make them tune out a bit."
rpg,3dz9h6,flat_pointer,5,Mon Jul 20 20:12:10 2015 UTC,"That being said, how do you handle throwing it back to the players? Could you give an example?"
rpg,3dz9h6,flat_pointer,9,Mon Jul 20 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. There's a lot of ways to do that. You can take the more story-game / Dungeon World approach and ask them their questions back at them. So like if they're asking about something in the setting or the area or about a person, ask them what they think. Just be prepared to use what they say, don't just nod and move on with what you had prepared. I have had players ask about random buildings on detailed city maps, asking 'what's here?' and I ask them in turn, well, what is there? It turned out it was some warehouse; now I have to try to turn that to something useful (frequented by smugglers), but I wasn't using that particular building then and didn't have to pull that out of my ass, thankfully. I don't do this a lot with big elements of the setting, but I definitely do it when I can take whatever they give me and run with it.  In general, just don't plan to have a long description to read to people. Ground the setting in familiar enough terms so that you don't have to do this. If the PCs are in a city, you don't need to spend a minute describing the city, its history, its leadership, its factions. Not in advance - obviously if they're asking about this, you should give them info. And if they ask for things you didn't expect, it's OK to say ""let me think, I really didn't expect you to be so interested in the cheesemaker's guild and implications that it supports the ivory revolutionaries, but let me think..."" And these are the kind of questions that are good to throw back at the players. Maybe the wizard PC knows a lot about exotic cheese, well, does she know a lot about the cheesemaker's guild?  You need maybe 'you are in the city of X' and one or two small details that stick out - the buildings are all roofed in gardens of fungus, which people eat, and the city guards are literally trained baboons. One spire in the city stretches up into the sky, you can't see the top, that's where the wizard magistrate lives. Ancient golems patrol the city and enforce unknowable laws on the present population.  Just tell them where they are, what the situation is (the bar is on fire and under attack from a gang-leader and some hollows/zombies), and ask them what they're doing. They know what a bar looks like, just tell them if it's trendy or shitty, posh or on the way out. If they need to know more, then look to your notes or make things up. You don't have to describe exits if they're standing and fighting, you don't have to describe chandeliers until some zombie swings from one. If you don't know if there's a chandelier or not and they ask if one is there, just say yes. Default to yes if they're not asking you to break all challenges and let them auto-win. Are there exits? Yes, and zombies stream in through them. Are there chandeliers? A second story? Sure, why the hell not. Can I carve the anti-zombie sigil in a chair and drive them all away at once? Nah, that's boring.  The games I like to run (Ghost/Echo, Numenera, these days, Blades in the Dark) don't require a lot of deeply detailed prep, thankfully, but even running 5E DnD, I always try to listen more than I talk.

rpg,3dz9h6,randomguy186,8,Tue Jul 21 09:12:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's easy to get into the trap of over describing locations and such to your players. You want to add flavor to the world so that they aren't playing in a blank plain that stretches to infinity, but you also don't want describe the color of the floor tiles if nobody gives a flying fuck what the colors of the floor tiles are.  So if you ever want to cut yourself, simply put the onus of conversation on the players. Ask them ""Well John, what are you looking at?"", ""What does John think about that?"", ""What are you going to do about that John?""  whatever detail you throw at the players, force a reaction out of them. After they give you their reaction, it's usually easier to come up with your own.  Although tactic, if your willing to put in the effort, is to prepare visual aids either on paper or with a computer monitor you set up. PC's walking to a dungeon? Show them a picture of some fantasy art you've pulled from somewhere so they get the general idea. A picture's worth a thousand words after all. Just make sure that your PC's understand that this is figurative depiction, and not a literal one. If they want to know specifics, they'll have to query you. If find this stuff works well if you want to convey a sense of landscape, or general architecture style, and less well if you're trying to describe a specific room."

Seriously, the 'uhs' and 'ums' are from you trying to flesh that picture out in the moment.   This may run counter to what others are saying, but IMHO, you probably need to write down very loose descriptions that put your head in the right space to just describe what you see in your mind's eye.   I find that trying to write and follow a script is harder than just describing what I see to other people. I won't get hung up on artsy fartsy words, and I won't have a dicked up rhythm.   I also think a lot of people try to take on the radio guy's voice when they are reading a description, which generally takes me out of the game."

It helps to note that ""uh"" literally means ""I have no idea what word should come out of my mouth"" - you will appear remarkedly more intelligent if you learn not to ""uh."" The rubber band trick can help - when you notice yourself doing it, snap your wrist with the rubber band.   just sit quietly for a few seconds   This is OK when GMing. Shuffle papers. Flip to a page in a notebook. Roll a D8 and a D20. You'll look like you're referring to a prepared description or explanation. Too much of this can be a problem, but a bit of activity gives you a couple of additional seconds before the players wonder why you're not talking."
rpg,3dz9h6,TheMindfulFool,5,Mon Jul 20 22:01:53 2015 UTC,"Don't write scripts write general ideas. Don't make things where you need to remember or read a lot. If your campaigns have a preset story then you're going to have to do a lot of remembering in ways that are hard to keep in the mind.  I'm in the same boat as you. The way I get around it is making sure the players are in an environment that's good to roleplay in. I typically have a character in the party that helps spark the roleplay if it's needed. I recap what happened the last session and what their characters might be feeling based on what I know about their characters. I make sure my players know that anything they want to make up, as long as it doesn't give them power or wealth in an overly direct way, is fine. They can make up towns, people, or whatever on the fly. I just write them down when they make them up and if I have a character in the conversation I'll say something along the lines of ""Never heard of X, what's X like?""  The most important thing to nurture this kind of environment where roleplay is king over advancement of some story is to create relationships between the characters. My favorite way is through a Fiasco-like set up. This will give them motivations as well. Numenera also has something that gives them relationships and motivations within the system.  With this kind of set up it allows me to be reactive to them rather than me leading them along. I still try to nudge toward an end goal but the game is about the journey rather than getting to the end as efficiently as possible.  Sometimes a small time campaign can be the most interesting. Not all campaigns need to be an epic through the hero's journey. When the setting is the same every campaign description isn't the most necessary thing. I've had a campaign in a small mining town in the West where they were all vying for a different outcome, but all hated the Chinese and planned on stopping their next opiate shipment. It was without a doubt my most successful campaign and most emotionally charged one after they started shooting each other at the climax."
rpg,3dz9h6,foxsable,4,Mon Jul 20 22:31:08 2015 UTC,"Sure, pauses are fine. But try re-thinking this. Are you the sole person responsible for describing the fiction and making the world interesting? If not, then hand off parts of those responsibilities. Ask a player to describe details for the group, for example.  I seek out games in which GMing isn't tasked with such a huge burden. Primetime Adventures, for example, ultimately gives all players equal directorial control while still having a GM."

You said you've dealt with issues of having to manage too may people so don't let the group get above four people (including you). Yes, you can't invite all your friends but you should practice in a small group before expanding into more people. A few years back, I could hardly handle two people. Now I manage six pretty damn well.   With fewer people, you might feel less stressed which is what I feel is the problem right now. You're worried about sounding cringy, and thus it happens. So, start small. Practice lines and description in the mirror when you are alone. Write out a bunch of stuff. Oh, also keep a list of random names on a sheet of paper. Whenever you run into an NPC you weren't really expecting to use, grab a name from the list. I learned that from a podcast mate of mine. Works like a charm!"

If the party does something or you are saying something that might cause you to ""uh"", stop, don't say anything, flip a page in the book while you gather your thoughts.

As they approach/enter the town ask the players leading questions so they invent those details. Ask the player of the fighter: ""what do you see about this town that makes it clear it is well defended?"". They might say there are high walls with guard towers, or a military training base, or a large chapter house of a organisation of mercenaries. Let them make it up. Ask the player of the cleric: ""how can you tell this town follows a religion different to yours?"" And ask the wizard: ""you overhear someone talking about a place of power in the city.

rpg,3dz9h6,mirtos,2,Tue Jul 21 00:23:51 2015 UTC,"Easiest trick I've learned is: say less. I've decided that I won't say much until everyone is done guessing, and cross talking, and discussing things. Don't chime in, unless you are directly asked.  Second best trick I've learned is: never lie. Always say the truth when it's demanded. You can always keep information from them, but you should never lie about information. If you are a liar, you cannot be trusted and people know this.  Third trick I've learned is: use the player's information against them. Very often a player will say something and I think ""Wow, that is actually better than what I had planned!"" And because I keep things they don't need to know a secret, I can easily shift things into the direction they think it might be going.  This is amazing because it gives you less work to do, it makes things more dynamic and interesting for everyone if no one person knows everything, and it makes the player who thought it up feel like they are starting to understand the world and the story more.  Fourth trick I've learned is: you need dynamic content that is always exciting and feels alive. At first thought this may sound really difficult, but it's not. It's easy, and here's how:  Make a list or a set of tables (if you like to roll) that have dynamic content in them. Not only this, but there are countless generators online that will give you plots, NPCs, treasure and encounters. Most of them can easily be adapted on the fly just for the flavor! Keep the mechanics as you need to.  For instance, I have a book full of 1-2 lines of compelling, interesting bits of story, or hooks. Every time I watch a show or movie and I get excited over some idea or setting, I write it down! I'll give you some examples I've used in the past.  In this example, I have a whole triage of lists of content I could grab at any moment and throw it into the scene. This is listed under [WANDERING INTO TOWN]:   This small village seems to be having a fair of some sort today. The public-ways are lined with tents and merchants of all kinds, trying to offer goods and services for somewhat fair price. It's hard to make out the theme of the festivities, because everyone seems to be wearing different colored hats, and grouping together in like colors. Why is there such a high tension in the air with such jolly happenings and laughing children everywhere?   I just keep thinking up this sort of story hook. These are so easy to makeup and they can be anything you want. I've been able to adapt sci fi scenes into fantasy and vice verse. It's important that you twist it with the last sentence, and give the players something to do here. It's a sign that there's more happening here if they are willing to investigate. It's not pushed.  By the way I don't read these to the players. I keep the hook in mind, or in front of me, when DMing and give out details when asked! It's fun to DM.  This makes it easy on you, and the players never know what's around the corner! Every little place they come to might have one of these hooks (sometimes you have to make a town nothing important, not everything can be 100% adrenaline.).  I dunno, hope that helps."

Also, you can practice your lines before a session happens, say it in front of a mirror, do it over and over and it will come easier to say during the session.

It was for them, and I'd see what they needed or wanted and just go with it. See if thinking in terms of what your players want and how you can help them achieve that.

rpg,3dz9h6,mazinaru,2,Tue Jul 21 02:50:16 2015 UTC,"Let's talk about talking.  Pausing, 'uh'-ing, etc., not cringeworthy, I promise. I mean -- let's be honest -- we're playing games in which we are half-drow half-orc space warrior princesses. This shit is already awkward; it's reasonable that you may, from time to time, be describing something 'cringeworthy'. The brilliant reality is that no one cares -- they've suspended their disbelief already, and so a bit of cringe isn't going to phase them.  Secondly -- sitting quietly for a few moments before describing a scene is totally reasonable. You can even make it a point in favor. The scene was so awesome you have to sit in awe of it for a minute -- it takes some time for your brain to mentally explore the room the party is in, or to visualize the destruction they caused.   Recently, while playing a game of Dark Heresy; the local tech-priest decided that the best way to deal with the 60,000 + feral ork horde chasing them was to overload a fusion core and create a 500kt nuclear blast. My response: ""Uh... Okay. Give me a few minutes to figure out what's going on with that...""  About 5 minutes later I had landed myself on a few dozen watch-lists and had wiki pages for nuclear bomb physics open. When it finally came time to describe what happened, I had to pause for a minute, I just opened with, ""Now, I've never seen a nuclear explosion, but I know the physics, so let me see if I can paint a picture."" What followed was a fair amount of 'uhm's and 'uh's -- but my players didn't care. They just nuked 60,000 orks, they were busy outrunning the blastwave and hoping this wasn't the end of the campaign.  The other thing to remember is that -- in addition to 'uhm's and 'uh's being totally reasonable -- saying less is often saying more. What I mean is -- you don't have to describe every detail, sometimes, ""You enter what appears to be a study, a room with two walls lined in bookshelves, and a heavy desk with a leather chair turned away at the far end.""  I didn't describe the smell of the room, or the colors on the walls. I didn't really describe any details at all, but there is a clear picture of that room in your head -- I guarantee it. When you describe less, you naturally will have fewer 'um' and 'uh' moments in your speech.  Finally, something I learned over time; whenever you start to say 'uh' or 'uhm'. Stop talking, take a breath and think about what you want to say. It's a discipline thing, more than anything. Instead of filling the space with noise, pause and come up with something to say. It sounds like, to be honest, the 'uh' and 'uhm' thing is probably mostly bothersome to you. That's totally reasonable (it annoys the crap out of me too), the only way I've been able to combat it is by really being disciplined about not using it; and instead embracing the silence. Eventually you will find those pauses get shorter, and you'll see them coming more readily. Then you'll feel much better about it, I think.  Parting remark -- listen to Obama speak sometime. He's clearly not a terrible orator, but there are plenty of 'uh's, 'uhm's, 'yknow's, and so on in his speech."

If you get hung up at any point either re-write that part or remove it. This will help your natural voice flow better.  Practice, practice, practice.

I mean, I can't say that for certain, but I wager heavily that your players are more concerned with their own performance and their own verbal tics to worry too much about yours.  There are lots of functional tricks being bandied about here, but as a sort of alternate suggestion, have you tried going along with it? By all means you can push and teach yourself to get into the stylistics you imagine. But I don't think it's necessary. You may have this idea in your head of MORTALS I COME FOR YOUR SOULS, of descriptors to match pace with Homer or Lovecraft, and the players hanging on your every dripping adverb. And that idea can get in the way of your actual comings and doings, of being a more quiet, measured DM. There's nothing wrong with avoiding bombast, and keeping to a much more casual and cozy atmosphere.  Like don't be afraid of pauses. Really don't be afraid of pauses. The pause is your friend. It's letting your unconscious do its thing. The only reason to fear the pause is if you have a preconceived notion of what you're supposed to sound like, in which case you're thinking ""oh, I don't sound like I should"" rather than just letting the game come out. Those pauses would have to be incredibly extreme for the players to notice.  I'm especially thinking that this might be the case because of the way you stumble over what you write out previously. That's a sort of clue that you're trying to be far too cerebral about it, and it's far more to you about the perception of how you should sound with words rather than your actual experience.

Not to find anything in the notebook, just to look like I'm looking for something during those periods of thought. When you need time to think up descriptions etc, just appear to be doing something other than thinking and you'll have a more comfortable and faster time with those thoughts.

First things first, realize that you are noticing these things a lot more then your players are.  Every DM you have ever had has had to pause, think, um and ah, but as a player you filter it out, just like you do during normal speech.    One of the things i did to help is to pick a character/voice/whatever and listen to NPR.  When they are doing a news interview I will mute the response and instead answer it as the NPC I am portraying.  It is easy to do this in your car, alone, and harder to do it in front of people, but getting batter at it means you have to actually do it."

It's definitely a nice piece of software, and I've tried a lot of the other virtual tabletops, and none really do as well. It's very reliable, and has every feature that I really would want to use for a vtt.   The only thing, is it's online, and if you are dealing with online people, they are usually pretty flaky.

Be prepared to spend another tracing every single wall with VBL. Or, you could spend one minute on almost-as-good fog of war.

rpg,3e2wt3,Quastors,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"With a surface temperature of -178 C, oxygen is going to freeze solid at night. That's the ballpark of cold that they're going to be dealing with. Without some serious survival gear anything unprotected will be dead in minutes (including any gear). Needing to scavenge weapons should put some pressure on them from the start.  If they aren't really well equipped, then simple survival is going to be the biggest priority. I'd suggest having a time limit of before sunset. They might have the survival gear for the day, but the night could drop the temperature far to low for their equipment. I'd imagine they need heated suits to survive, so dealing with short lived power supplies being chilled below ideal operating temps (or simply being pushed to the limit to keep the wearer alive) requires them to be on the hunt for more power.  They're also going to be much hotter than the surrounding environment, so playing up stuff like their footsteps melting the ground temporarily, or even creating unstable areas. This could be an extra risk when indoors, as they can begin to melt any ice caves they shelter in for too long due to body heat and little moving air.  Oxygen supplies would also be a good thing to find, depending on how much they have, as they won't exactly be able to breath the atmosphere.  So they're unarmed, badly in need of supplies, and will all die when the sun sets, almost no matter what. (If they can find better suits and heated shelter perhaps they can change). While being hunted by a skilled, and presumably better equipped adversary. That's a full session right there. Remember that stealth will be impossible against someone with a thermal imager or similar, as being near the environmental temperature is lethal.  I actually ran something kind of similar recently, though without the combat part, but it was a similarly cold planet. The party was pretty significantly different from a ME party though, so survival was less of a problem."

Those guys are hilarious, and their GM runs a great game. They have 75 or so good episodes before the group changes (for the worse, unfortunately), but if you start from the beginning that will occupy you for a long time. It's a great series, but give the group an episode or two to gel.  Campaign is another favorite of mine. Whereas Nerd Poker is a cross between stand-up and an RPG, Campaign is a cross between RPG and improv. The players are a group of improvers in Chicago and they also run an awesome game, very funny and great narratively. Their GM is also incredible, I wish I could run a game like her. I can't recommend this and Nerd Poker enough.  One Shot is what Campaign was birthed out of - it's run by various improv and writer-types around Chicago and is exactly what it sounds like. Every 3 or 4 episodes is a new one-shot of a new RPG.

So, combat is lethal, to highlight immortality... I don't think you know what lethal means. Lethal means, your characters are gonna die if you take two hits, not ""Everything your characters touch dies.""  I'm not really sure why I should care about this RPG system over any other, since you decided the lore was most important and left the gameplay to a single paragraph, basically saying ""Dice pools."" and that's it.  I'm not reading through a wordpress to figure out what you made, you should've just straight-up said what your system is. Also, that's an unfortunate choice of name, because every time I look at it, I think that you misspelled ""Inkscape"" which is an art program.  Also, let me explain the issue with lore; You're putting that first, as if that matters more than the system. It doesn't. If you're trying to sell a system, you put the mechanics first, and the intent of the system.  So, that's where you would put your dice pool description and what your mechanics reward you for, then you say ""The characters are gods, and the mechanics support that play."" then you link to a blog so we can read more about it.  I'm not trying to attack you here, I'm just trying to explain why this kind of post out here isn't doing you too many favors.

You could even make it sympathetic by giving it two conflicting goals, because it wants to protect them but it's also not allowed to tell them about how underequipped they are. Give it a morally ambiguous verbal tic whenever those two goals are conflicting so that they think it's crazy.  So yes, they do have a medical lab that can raise the dead.

If you want the AI to be ultimately helpful, make it have orders to withhold information and erase itself if captured so that the traitor fleet doesn't know they've been found out yet. Another option could be that it has received conflicting orders from fleet command and the traitors and it actually doesn't know what to do. A third option is that it has been given orders to blank out and ignore any communication outside the ship so that it can't be suborned by any backdoors.  There's a lot you could do with this. I would try to lay out as much ambiguity as possible and hint at several different things, so that you can pick and choose which options are the truth in later sessions."

As the players see how smart high level alphas get, it can add an ""oh crap!"" element once they realize what would happen if the plague got control of the kind of processing power a Ship's AI plays around with.

One really good thing to do is talk to each player individually and get them to come up with a goal and backstory for their character.  This can get them more involved with the campaign, as it helps personalize it for everyone.  As the GM, you should make an effort to include at least one player's obligation/back-story each session.  One other trick to do (especially if you're playing a game like Shadowrun, Spycraft, or Mutants and Masterminds) is to come up with a character secret.  It can involve their character directly, or involve another player's character indirectly.  These are all things that can really get the players more invested in the story."

Even just thinking about things for 5 minutes is enough.  Some days I end up drawing a map or writing some things or creating NPCs or whatever, but most days I just mull over the plot a bit more.

All good times to ponder.  2) Adjust your schedule. If you aren't getting enough time between sessions to plan to your satisfaction then reduce the frequency of your games. Instead of playing two games a week, play one game a week. Or play every other week, or monthly. Maybe run one game and play in another since playing is less work than running.  3) Borrow from other places. Making everything yourself is fun but there's a reason publishers make campaign settings and supplements. The adventure paths for Pathfinder, for example, are pretty popular. Take what you need to the extent that you need, whether it's a map, a custom enemy, a whole adventure arc, whatever.  Really, it's a question if time management. If you're just too damn busy you might need to stop and think about what you really want/need to be doing and maybe something needs to be cut.  Also, those good ideas when you're falling asleep might not be so great in the morning when your brain is fully functioning. If you can jot them down, great!

We use rules-light, collaboration heavy systems with my larger, more casual game group. We're just about to kick off a new game of Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies. We're meeting this week to create characters and motivations. As we move forward, I expect the players to take advantage of the system that allows them to take over the narrative. Using a game system that allows for this level of collaboration really reduces the burden of planning on me.  I mostly stick to authored game materials for my other group, we're even using pre-generated characters in our new game of Godlike. The game will only run four sessions, so we don't expect to see much in the way of character progression. Given the research that goes into the Godlike supplements, using them not only cuts down the overhead for all of us, but increases the quality of the scenario. I cannot offer up the time to pull together an authentic sounding WWII setting.   I also only play each game once a month. That helps, a lot."

The important thing is to capture the idea, if you don't it will disappear, likely forever.  Use an egg timer for timing your blocks and be strict about it.

We've been doing this without fail for the last five years, so I know a bit about trying to come up with some stuff!  What helps me is not rushing an idea. My group has five GMs who are ready to GM when the moment strikes them. At the end of each session, we plan for the next game, and if someone isn't ready with something, we ask if anyone is willing to run their idea. If no one is ready, we take a week or two off from playing. By that point, one of us is usually ready to run something.  Also, there is something known as overplanning. If you know your group and your group knows you well enough, a simple idea and a few sentences might be all you need to run something. For my group, I know one guy will always want to use magic, one guy will always want to be the talker, and I know for a fact that a lady in our group is going to be anti-magic and most likely a warrior. I know their attitudes, their personality quirks, and thus I know what kind of hooks I can drop to get them to chase an enemy or even make up their own problems in a setting. I wouldn't recommend this with a new group, of course, but after awhile, I highly recommend atleast trying going into a session with merely a vague idea for a game plot.

They provide their characters One Unique Things, their backgrounds, and their relationships to the Icons (the major movers and shakers of the world). I'll start with something simple, or steal ideas from old modules, and as we play they'll often talk to each-other hypothesizing on who the bad guy is, what's the problem, what's the solution... and I steal the ones that sound good and move them around a bit.  If they're going to meet a well-known NPC I may ask what rumors they've heard about them- two of my favorite NPCs came from the players.   Another good tool is montages (I got the idea from 13th Age's free adventures) where you ask a player what problem they came across on their travel from A to B, then ask the next player to say how they resolved the issue. Ask that player to describe another thing that came up, and keep going around the table 'til everyone's had something to say. You can get some fun hooks that way!"
rpg,3dyg6e,Rubrum_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:07 2015 UTC,"I keep a notebook, or notebooks, near at hand almost constantly. Failing that, I use my phone's notepad app. The critical point is, jot down notes, ideas, stray thoughts, images, names, traps, and everything else as they pop in to your brain. You never know when it will come in thematic handy during planning, or better yet, plug a hole when the PCs leap over your campaign's rails.  I'm a passable improviser, so I don't exhaustively plan much, but I like to have a large framework in place. I'll plan a scenario entirely differently if it's based more around political intrigue than if it's a typical smash-and-grab dungeon crawl. The former needs a structure to the various factions and their motivations, as well as leaders and agents at the very least but don't expect your players to follow Point A-Point B-Point C with any regard for your planning. A dungeon obviously has different concerns.  In any case, once I have an idea of what type of campaign/scenario I'm going to run, I usually try to throw on music or a movie that matches the tone I've got in my head, and try to turn those scattered notes into a coherent structure. My current projects are a long-term political-economic oriented Eclipse Phase campaign and a one-shot Cthulhu scenario. Both necessitate different approaches. I have a story for the latter, and a network of relationships for the former."

Over the years, I've written a handful of spreadsheets and generators that spit out bare-bones settlements, dungeons, and story outlines.  I've pre-printed several of each and stuffed them in a binder.  I've also settled on a handful of 'loaner' characters that I keep in the binder to lend out to new friends or guest players.  Those go in the binder too and serve as a pool of NPCs when needed.  I've also played them as a player from time to time as well.  I've slowly (very slowly) built my world and printed regional maps of all the major adventurable places, and put them in the binder.  And finally, I wrote a little smartpack that I keep in my work backpack which serves as my on-the-go writing prompt.  It's got a series of questions I like to ask myself which help guide my prep.  It also has a list of names for places I haven't put on the map yet.  And it has a little oultine of the Hero's Journey and the Five Room Dungeon that I can use to frame a quest or adventure location.  All this has made it to where as long as I spend a few minutes at work with my adventure questionnaire,  I'll ask myself those key questions during prep and can pull pre-made products from my binder when it's time to play.  I love my binder and smartpack.  I used a computer to make it, but can prep and play totally on scratch paper if need be.

rpg,3dydxw,FireVisor,10,Mon Jul 20 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"I used to be a huge advocate for TT on this sub, but I'm largely over it. It's always changing, so maybe some of why I left got fixed. I think combat is really boring in the system, especially if anybody in your group has the eye to optimize their damage. It's like a standard d20 system, except you hit more often than not and everybody can take a ton of damage. It's the exact opposite of gritty combat in that respect, and your heroes will rarely feel like they're in actual danger. The stat system is way wack in my opinion. You get to assign a set array of bonuses to a few different things, but what each of them do is really subjective, so players will always use their biggest bonus. For example, it's explicitly in the rules that you can use whichever attribute you like for attack rolls. The powers that you gain are pretty cool, I have to admit. If you've played FATE and wanted some more fantasy-specific quirks to add to the system, TT might be what you're looking for. TT can be a good system for a good GM, but I don't think it brings much to the table the way Burning Wheel, D&D, WoD, Traveller and a lot of other systems bring their own personality to the table."
rpg,3dydxw,dugganEE,11,Mon Jul 20 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, let me say 'thanks' for making the system free. I got a far amount of mileage out of it, and I know for a fact it's open-sourceyness was a huge help in recruiting players and GM's. It's probably the only reason I survived trying to run a table of 8 people for a semester, what with the intuitive rules and character creation. I took another look at the rules, and I remembered what I liked about it way back when: it encouraged players to contribute to the story. I think that's fantastic, and I wish more systems acknolaged the give and take of storytelling in an RPG.   That said, it broke my heart every time I saw players trip over the stats. The problem is, if somebody's got high brawn, they'll come up with brawny ideas all day long. If they're finessey, they'll come up with finesse ideas. I've seen players go half-way through describing some awesome attack, only to realize that it would probably use a weaker stat and say ""Nevermind, I'll just throw a fireball (again)"". Mechanically, if you want to encourage players to go against the grain and do something that doesn't play to their character's strength, you have to give them advantage, otherwise it's very obvious sub-optimal play.   Some of my favorite RPG moments come from times when characters know they're not well-suited to a task, but they have to try despite the odds. I distinctly remember watching a rough and stoic barbarian try to charm a medusa as a last ditch effort, and when he crit the table exploded. That does happen-can't happen-in TT because everyone is lock-step in the stereotype of their primary attribute. Sometimes it's amusing and interesting to see characters try to shoe-horn their best stat into an unlikely task, but most of the time it's really obvious and a bit of a drag.   In the interest of productive discussion, I might point to other systems and what they do to alleviate the same problem. In D&D, the combination of stats that add to a given roll is incredibly well defined, and tasks are of varying difficulty. If you say that applying a smart or creative plan requires a lesser DC than the good 'ol hack and slash, you get orcs that charm and shrewd elves, and generally a wider range of character expression. In nWod, there's attributes that apply more to the style of the task while there are skills that are more ridgid, which lets characters have more nuanced aptitudes. Common sense goes a long way here, but TT lends itself to more pulpy situations. ""I'll befriend the sheriff WITH MY MUSCLES"" is a thing that was said at my table once. Everyone laughed, I let him roll brawn, but it sort of sums up the problem nicely. As u/david2ndaccount pointed out, when everybody gets to use the same big bonus for everything, what's the point of having a bonus in the first place?  Apologies for the ranty format, on my phone."

Perhaps a player gets 2 of these, or 3 of these and one negative one, like 'Clumsy as an Ox' or 'Ugly as Sin'.  Or, I'd leave the stats entirely game related, so like 'Attack', 'Defense' 'Ranged' and 'Toughness' for combat stats and 'Perceptive' 'Rugged' 'Knowledgeable' for exploration stats and 'Diplomacy' 'Persuasion' and 'Insight' for socialize stats."

rpg,3dydxw,heavysleepinplamp,4,Mon Jul 20 22:19:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't played the game, but if you can just use your highest stat for whatever, then what's the point of stats? why not just give everyone the same bonus to everything? and if you're doing that, why give bonuses at all? I believe that most people want someone who is strong to approach situations differently than someone who is smart and have this be represented mechanically rather than just dressed up in flavor."
rpg,3dydxw,david2ndaccount,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"Because otherwise, rather than Brawn / Finesse / Mind / Spirit, you might as well name the stats Melee / Ranged / Magic / Defense.    I prefer the situation in which people don't feel obligated to be a brawny, roid-raging barbarian for their melee character if they'd prefer a duelist with a bit more finesse or a character that strikes pressure points to take down opponents as gently as possible."
rpg,3dydxw,heavysleepinplamp,5,Mon Jul 20 17:44:19 2015 UTC,"We've done that in our latest game - each class (we call 'em roles, but they function like D&D classes) has a built-in melee, ranged and defence score, and we leave it at that. (We don't even have magic stats; if it's ranged magic, use your ranged stat, etc.) We've found that it opens the door for some really interesting fluff around weapons and attacks whilst not getting bogged down in mechanics, which is pretty much my least favourite thing when I'm playing a game.  (Also, as a house rule, in combat, applied liberally to any and all D20 systems: characters roll to hit and damage as though they were using their best weapon at all times, and you can just say what you want in the fiction. So it means that, while on one hand the bar counter does greatsword damage when you smack someone's head off it, it lends a huge variety to attacks with no worry about being sub-optimal for doing so.)  EDIT: Oh, also, Tavern Tales is lovely, I really appreciate how free-wheeling it is with class and power structure. There's so many ideas just waiting to be made out of it."
rpg,3dydxw,gshowitt,2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:36 2015 UTC,"Sure, but why have stats at all in that case? Why not just have a duelist class that has finesse moves and such and forget the minutiae of exactly how graceful you are? Although at this point in my RPG career I feel that strength scores etc. don't work too well with classes."

rpg,3dydxw,invictus_potato,5,Mon Jul 20 21:49:17 2015 UTC,"It's a great system, I love it because it fits my GM style, fast and loose. Everything can be adapted to a wide variety of situations, and it seems to get out of the way, while still providing a lot of nice options both in combat and out of it.   However, it does, require player cooperation and understanding. It is really easy to abuse the vague nature of the game's rules to overcome just about any obstacle that a GM can throw. Since so much is up for GM and player discretion, an argumentative player can slow the game down considerably.   The combat is lackluster, again, a player who wants to be the best instead of rolelplay can quickly leave every other player in the dust by orders of magnitude.   However, choose your players wisely, and know that this is a game that is more about communually telling a story rather than about playing a game. Since I found my players on a role-playing site, that was easy to get across and I fell in love with the system.   Out of boredom, I'm converting its rules to Python, rolling dice, modifying dice, creating and maintaining players (including traits) all that. Why? I'm not exactly sure, but it's a fun project."
rpg,3dydxw,Pseudoboss11,4,Mon Jul 20 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"I love Tavern Tales.  I ran a campaign that lasted about 30 sessions. Every session was fun. At times we had 7 players and it never bogged down. We took a break to play D&D 5e, but I think Tavern Tales is a better game.  The biggest challenge I had was managing the power level. It plays a little like fantasy-supers. Starting characters can have powers equivalent to 9th level spells from D&D or Pathfinder.  Clever players can easily maximize their capabilities so nothing poses any challenge. Having done that, they might then find the game boring because they're overpowered. So I'd say Tavern Tales isn't well suited for minmaxers.  I granted level-ups based on XP/number of sessions played. I might rethink that approach. Level ups in Tavern Tales might be better if they're tied to milestones and quest rewards. Ask the players what trait they hoping to get next, then ask how they plan to acquire that trait in-game. Make a quest out of it.  I suspect everyone can find some aspect that they don't like about any game system. With Tavern Tales, that's compounded by the open-development process. Sometimes the game changes in ways you might not agree with.  I like the 4 stats which can be used in creative ways. I like having the dice options: you can use multi-roll (D&D style, IgoUgo) or Player-Only (apocalypse world style) rolling. I'm not onboard with a recent proposal to remove mixed-results from the player-only rolling. I'm generally opposed to increasing the power level, because PCs are already so damn over the top epic awesome.  I like my campaigns grim and gritty, so I came up with a couple of houserule tweaks to make the game harder. Rolls were: Disadvantage = 3d10 keep lowest 2, Normal = 2d10, and Advantage = 3d10 keep highest 2 (same target numbers). If I ran it again, I'd also use half the normal starting health.  Here's a recording from one of our sessions if you're interested.  Finally, I think Tavern Tales, like most games, works best when the GM is a fan of the Characters. Just like in Improv, the GM should generally say yes."

rpg,3dydxw,whoevenare,2,Tue Jul 21 00:05:55 2015 UTC,"Ran a few good games of it, players seem to really like it! It has a very heroic kinda feel to some of the powers. However, some seem to be little op like there is one that lets you take anything from a foe if you achieved victory. One of my players squeezed information out of a guy, wanted to consider it a victory and take his house. The other players had to convince him otherwise and we weren't sure if it would be considered a victory. So we settled it mute and he took his family gems.  That aside its very fun as you aren't limited to class stats and can basically be anything you want."
rpg,3e0ahb,mercury-shade,5,Mon Jul 20 23:37:47 2015 UTC,"So, let's go through the things you didn't like about 4e and see what 13th Age does regarding them.      Healing surges: These still exist, in about the same way they do in 4e and 5e. That's because hit points are not meat points and haven't been since original DnD. So if you don't like them, well, that might be a dealbreaker.    Classes feeling the same: Doesn't really happen in 13th Age, since their combat powers tend to be all be pretty different. You might find the core paladin or barbarian a little boring though, since they're focused on getting passive talents that buff their basic attacks. Of course, you might as well say that a ranger and a paladin in 3.5e are the same, since they're both armor-wearing half-casters that have some kind of animal friend. Or that sorcerer and wizard are the same because they have the exact same spell list.   Skills and noncombat: This is a more complex one to get into. 'Skills' in 13A are now 'backgrounds', and they're freeform, but you have a limited number of points in them, which some feats let you increase. For example, 'climber +3' might be a background. It's a pretty boring one, though - 'Survivor of the Doomed Misty Mountain Climb +3' is a much better background. You can use your backgrounds on whatever you can convince your GM it applies to. For example, climbing something your GM might say ""roll Strength"", but you might say ""hey, I'm a survivor, I know how to climb"" and your GM says ""sure, you can add that to the roll"".    However, here's something you may be missing - the reason the class powers are mostly all to do with combat is because DnD is a combat game. For the past 3 editions, DnD has been about the combat (OD&D was a heist game about busting into a dungeon, getting treasure, and getting out, and if you ask ten people what 2e was about you'll get 11 different answers). It's why 3.5e assumes you'll use minis and a grid, why 4e assumes minis and a grid, why 5e assumes minis and a grid (you can say you don't, but then you're nerfing anyone who relies on positioning in battles, like fighters and close-range mages). If you wanted a game that wasn't about combat in a significant capacity, then you don't want DnD (or 13th Age, which is essentially The Other 5e).    On the other hand, 13th Age would like you to use minis, but you don't need them, and unlike every edition of DnD, not only do you not need a grid, but you can't use a grid with the combat system - it just doesn't work. You're just either 'engaged' with an enemy, 'nearby' them, or 'far away' and can't get close to hit them. So you might like that.    I hope that helps out!"
rpg,3e0ahb,sarded,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"Hey, just wanted to reply to a couple things, first of all that was a lot of really helpful info, so thanks!  In terms of healing surges...that was the one part I knew was in 13A from 4. Its less about that I want damage to be permanent or anything and more that it doesn't make sense to me why a totally nonmagical fighter can suddenly be not hurt anymore of his own accord. I've heard many explanations but none are especially satisfying to me, so while I understand this and the various per time powers from a mechanical / balance perspective and why some people like them, there's flavour in it that rubs me the wrong way. That said, what I'd be wondering most about 13A as regards surges is would removing them unbalance the game, or would it be just a case of ""make the encounter a bit easier and it'll be fine."" If I wanted to houserule it out.  I won't argue that D&D's rules centre on combat, that's pretty indisputable, although I don't think that means it's not possible or even necessarily not good to do other stuff in it. Although that said I didn't mean to sound like I was harping on crunchy fights or simulation, I have pretty much equal love for most types of games on a high level, I don't mind rules weight or game type differences really. More just that my personal experience was that there were more spells and feats and different things in general for dealing with travel or crawling or urban situations. May have just been my experience though.   I actually have played far more gridless d&d than with a battle map, especially in 3.5, and we never really had any issues with it. I think that's part of why the range bands appeal to me is even just the fact that the system is designed to be used this way. D&D certainly can be but it means discretionary calls which isn't everyone's favourite."
rpg,3e0ahb,sarded,2,Tue Jul 21 05:19:15 2015 UTC,"You can set healing surges to 'triggered only' by spells and potions. This would require showering the party with healing potions, though, to match the number they'd need to get through the number of fights (8 per full heal-up). That, and maybe make full heal-ups more often, maybe roughly every two or three fights instead of every four or so fights.    Hit points only really work when you realise that they don't measure ""how much life you have left"" but ""how much luck you have left"". It's not that the warrior got ten times by an axe but only the last one counts - it's that every other hit was a glancing blow, or a minor cut, or a near miss, draining their fatigue and magical buffs and luck, until finally they couldn't avoid that one last hit that dislocates their arm and sends them to the ground.    When they use a healing surge, it's not ""my cuts have magically healed"", it's ""Let's all catch our breath and remind each other what we're fighting for."" In narrative terms - an action movie, when the heroes run away from an explosion, get sent flying, and then get up mostly unharmed, they still lost a lot of hit points. They just didn't get sent to zero - because zero would, if not kill them, make them a screaming heap on the ground."
rpg,3e0ahb,sarded,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:36:35 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the different interpretations on how stuff work, some of those are things I hadn't considered.

rpg,3e0ahb,ScooterinAB,2,Tue Jul 21 12:49:59 2015 UTC,"If you disagree with that interpretation of hit points, you disagree with how they've been described in every single edition of DnD ever written, including the original Dungeon Master's Guide. You can even google search ""gygax hit points"" to see the original opinion (which has been consistently repeated, though naturally not in the exact same words)."
rpg,3e0ahb,Oshojabe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, realized after that I replied to the wrong one of your posts to make that clear. The interpretation comment was meant to tie into the class stuff above, it's a neat idea. I was at one point aware of the concept of hit points not strictly as damage but I'll admit none of my DMs really ran it that way, and our groups on the whole haven't been especially concerned with following the letter of the rules. Still, it does make that particular mechanic have a much better internal consistency at least, so thanks for reminding me of it, it's been a while since I gave any of the books a cover to cover read, and not having used it that way I had forgotten that was the official stance."
rpg,3e0ahb,esoares,0,Tue Jul 21 13:39:56 2015 UTC,"Though to be fair, every edition of D&D has been a combat oriented miniatures game (seriously, every edition, it's kinda ridiculous). I agree though that if you wanted to do a political intrigue game with no combat, there are probably a million games that are going to do it better than any version or iteration of D&D."
rpg,3e0ahb,ScooterinAB,6,Tue Jul 21 04:28:00 2015 UTC,"Your first sentence is wrong on the face of it. Old School D&D was actually a tightly designed dungeon crawl/heist game: you got most of your experience from gold, and there was no concept of encounter balance which means any combat could be deadly - so instead of the ""kill monsters, take their stuff"" formula of later editions, you had ""find some way to overcome or bypass the monsters, and take their stuff.""  The transition from combat being just one of many obstacles faced while exploring dungeons to the central focus of the game started when D&D became a fad in the 70s, and became more and more cemented with every edition."
rpg,3e0ahb,Oshojabe,2,Tue Jul 21 05:37:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly  Anyone claiming that OD&D, BD&D, 1st AD&D or even 2nd AD&D are about combat, clearly never read any of those books."
rpg,3e0ahb,ScooterinAB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:38 2015 UTC,"Except that the book Designers and Dragons spells out the contrary. In it's description of the people and company behind D&D as well as it's history of the game and its development, D&D is always described as a combat game. For years, the game completely lacked any mechanism for the heist game that you describe. Sure, maybe you should think your way through a given fight, but that follows the tactical framework of a combat oriented miniatures game, not the roleplaying framework that we see in modern era games. In fact, the book points out that 2nd edition AD&D was specifically designed to try at add more play options to the game, although it continued to be focused on combat tactics. Despite being the first roleplaying game, it surprisingly failed on that front."
rpg,3e0ahb,pasabaporahi,0,Tue Jul 21 15:19:49 2015 UTC,"What mechanisms was it lacking to make it a heist? The two most important mechanisms in my mind are XP-for-gold, and deadly combat - and those were both there from the beginning. The point is not that it didn't have combat rules, but that if you wanted to live and get the most experience possible the rules pushed you towards stealing treasure and avoiding fights where possible.  D&D did grow out of war-gaming, so it initially used miniatures for combat, but by the time AD&D and Blue Box Basic were released it had started to move away from miniatures. I don't think it's an accident that the 1e DMG has only about half a page describing the use of miniatures in a 240 page book.  It's just flat out wrong to say that D&D has ""always been a combat-oriented miniature game."" The game has changed and evolved over the course of its history, and for some of that the use of miniatures was de-emphasized, and for much of that combat was deadly enough and the XP from it meagre enough (compared to the XP from treasure) that a heist-style of play was implicitly encouraged by the rules."

rpg,3e0ahb,Niallism,3,Tue Jul 21 12:37:59 2015 UTC,"encounter / daily / whatever frequency powers   These still exist in some classes, but are completely absent in others. Some classes in 13th Age also use ""flexible attacks"" which are rider effects on basic attacks that trigger on things like a natural even hit, a natural 16+, a miss when the escalation die is even, etc. The result and intent behind these power structures differs philosophically with 4th Edition on two fronts. In 4th edition, the power division was intended to create a ""challenge metagame"", so tacticians and power gamers could optimize their decisions, whereas the power division in 13th Age exists more for the sake of variety and cinematic flash while preserving a degree of simplicity.   the fact that we felt all classes felt very similar (not helped by the powers)   Classes feel very different in 13th Age, each with their own ""schtick"". One thing that might cause some consternation is some classes are deliberately designed to be more simple than others.   the extreme focus on combat and reduced focus on noncombat   13th Age has more non-combat features built into the system than 3.5. 3.5 just has skills and few spells/feats that often get ignored. The specific subsystems 13th Age uses to create more non-combat roleplaying include Icon Relationships (ties characters have to important people/organizations in the world), One Unique Thing (what makes the character special), and the skill system, which can be used to inform the world.   We also liked the progression in skills that 3e offered over the more static skills in 5    Skills are more static in 13th Age, but if you can justify something with your background, you can use your skill bonuses on a task.   whatever aspects of 13th Age I'm not aware   Combat in 3.5 and 4th Edition can often slow to a slog. One way 13th Age handles this is the Escalation Die. Starting on turn 2, a d6 is place at 1. Each turn thereafter, it increases by 1. Players (and really, really important enemies) get the escalation die as a bonus to their attack rolls. Some powers are also keyed off the escalation die. A simplified version of the design philosophy was applied to the monsters, creating encounters that run themselves. 13th Age is less designed to be a combat or fantasy world simulation engine than 4th and 3.5 respectively, I would almost call it a crunchier version of Dungeon World in that it seeks to create fantastic fiction.  I'd say pick up a copy, if only to crib ideas from for your fantasy d20 games, whether you ever play 13th Age or not."

I guess the main issue I have with the per whatever powers is that some felt...narratively unjustifiable, in the sense that a fighter can do something that basically equates to magic when logically there's no reason he should be able to?  Some people will berate me for this and point to Tome of Battle but again, don't want to start an argument here,I recognize 4e works for some people in what it does, I just happen not to be one. So I suppose the powers are of lesser concern to me if the way they're flavoured makes sense with what their class should be able to do? I hope I explained that well."

Event:  In LORE there's a trait system, and one of my players chose the ""famous"" trait, and thought up something called the Pondama Affair as the reason for his fame. He said it was something that pretty much wiped out both sides, and through luck and some skill he was  the only combatant survivor, but he got a reputation for being a bad ass because of it.  I took that idea and tried to tell a story with the illustration. I was thinking two gangs clashed in the town of Pondama, and ended up killing most of it's inhabitants, and burning it to the ground in the process.  That's 10-15 years back in the story.  World:  The world itself is a bit cliche. Standard post-nuclear war kind of wasteland, but 100-200 years down the road. ""The Wastes"" is a hot dry area, but there's no radiation. North is where most of the fallout is. To the east is a large mountain range and beyond that are more civilised lands. West is the ocean. South is the bone dry, rocky canyons where no one lives. Most of the rivers run through heavily irradiated areas, and thus the water is tainted. But there's one river bordering the poisoned lands to the north called The Mercy that is clean. So most people live near that.  Technology is just starting to get developed again. New revolving firearms can be made. There's some minor understanding of electronics among the very educated.  The only bit of ""magic"" is a drug that grows in the irradiated areas, called Sweet, that lets one slow or speed time for themselves to a limited degree. It's addictive, and perhaps has some unforseen consequences. There's a cult that uses it living in one of the less deadly areas, but where the drug still grows.  My players are enforcers working for a guy called ""The Duke"". There's a big time outlaw that The Duke executed via radiation poisoning 10 years ago, but turns out he's not dead (or is he?) and he's come out of the poison lands threatening to raze the wastes, and kill The Duke.

That being said, I'd totally be interested in a Destiny tabletop RPG!   I'm sure it would be easy to convert a system to work with Destiny flavor, but as someone who does not play the games I don't think I'd bother unless there was something official."
rpg,3dyg4u,Approval_Pending,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:25 2015 UTC,"I think if you started it off as some low level guardians you'll be fine. The coolest memories of Destiny I have are in the lower levels; when you just get your super and find a main weapon you like. No worries about Gjallarhorn or Thorn or any exotics. Just strait up discovery, aliens, and space magic. That could easily be put into a PnP RPG.   FATE might be worth a look. You could use skills such as ""Super"" ""Long Range Combat"" ""Mid Range Combat"" ""Close Quarters Combat"" ""Ghost"" ""Armor/Shields"" ect. And you could use aspects such as ""Suppressed"" ""Blinded"" (from flashbang grenades) or whatever else fits.  Something else you might want to keep in mind is that if you introduce your game to players as an ""Destiny RPG"" then you present an already established expectation of the universe and game. You might want to try titling it as an ""RPG heavily inspired by Destiny"". That will give your players the impression that it will be like Destiny but still have something fresh. You will have extra wiggle room to fluff things like characters, places, weapons (perhaps a guardian with a sword enhanced by light tickles your fancy?) and even events, should you need to stretch the boundaries of the lore.  Good luck! :)"

Lots of weapon tables with unique effects for each gun and cool critical tables plus a magic system split into three types of magic: essence, channeling and mentalism, that with a little tweaking could be used to represent the classes 'supers' (Arc, Solar and Void).

It is entirely possible to play a game set in the destiny verse without the focus on combat, and particular assets of the game like super/grenade/melee energy."
rpg,3dyg4u,NecronPariah,2,Tue Jul 21 08:51:23 2015 UTC,"I wrote this last weekend. It's a conversion for D&D 5e to the Destiny setting. WIP, but I think it's got something going for it.  Explanations of some design decisions:   I wanted players to have the choice of more than just three classes and two subclasses. Additionally, many of the D&D classes seem to line up well in their playstyle and play experience with the different classes of Destiny. As such, I simply listed the classes and subclasses from D&D that people can play in Destiny, and divided them into three groups: Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks. There is no separate pool for ""Shields/Armor"" on top of your HP. This is because I figured that Shields/Armor was taken into account with how the armor you character wears affects their armor class (and thus how hard it is to injure/wear them down through HP damage). It is worth reminding players that in D&D, taking HP damage does NOT mean you got physically hit - it means you had to physically exert yourself to avoid the attack, or the attack came so close to killing you, it drained your composure. The only times you are physically hit is when an attack knocks you to half-HP or to 0 HP. A sniper shot that damages your HP but does not put you at half-HP or 0 HP whizzed right by your ear and scared the piss out of you. I made the difficult choice to cut pulse rifles as a separate weapon category. I did not have enough flexibility with the dice damage to include them and auto rifles, and since auto-rifles effectively function as pulse rifles, but also with a ""spray and pray"" mechanic, pulse rifles felt just a bit too redundant to be in there as a separate weapon type. I also lowered the firearms damage so that the melee weapons in the Player's Handbook would still be useful. I visit this subreddit, too, and the number of people clamoring for melee weapons in the video game did not go unnoticed... Weapon ammo capacities differ between weapons. When your character finds a weapon, the DM will roll for the size of its ammo capacity. Generally, a hand cannon can hold 1d6+4 bullets in a chamber, a scout rifle can hold 1d8+10 bullets in its magazine, an auto rifle can hold 2d10+20 bullets, a shotgun holds 1d4+4 shells, a sniper rifle holds 1d6+2 bullets, a machine gun holds 5d10+50 bullets, and a rocket launcher holds 1d3 rockets. I don't have any monsters made yet, but I'm interested to here what some people might use as surrogates, how they might design each different enemy, and whether or not they feel I should be more enemies than what we saw in the game (and if so, what they should be)."

In the same way that D&D is about combat, Destiny is a game built around fighting to get... something.   Some people fight for the story, others for the guns, and others for the lore. Whatever the case, the game is about fighting swarms of enemies to get to what you want.  Games that are Powered by Apocalypse are rarely about combat in this way. Sure, some of them have fairly robust combat rules (Dungeon World, for example) but even then combat is only the tiniest corner of what those games are about."

The caster will have disadvantage to hit if they cast a ranged spell adjacent to an enemy. And if the spell duration includes Concentration, they will need to make a Constitution save to keep the spell, target # = half of damage, minimum 10.  Magic missiles have been getting out of hand in my campaign due to that. Three (or more) Con saves of 10 is difficult now..."
rpg,3e01gg,thaneofEurmal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:32:26 2015 UTC,"For clarification, the Concentration check is done when the spellcaster receives damage while maintaining a spell that requires Concentration.  Your wording was a tad ambiguous."
rpg,3e01gg,Maebure83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:13:23 2015 UTC,If the spell is instantaneous like magic missile then the spell is cast and goes off.  If its a spell that can last and requires concentration then things can happen to force the caster to make checks to keep concentration.  Easiest way to tell is if the spell can last for more than 1 turn.
rpg,3e01gg,warpedwigwam,0,Mon Jul 20 22:37:39 2015 UTC,casting a spell while in melee range causes the spell to be cast with disadvantage(ie. the attack roll). Taking damage can cause a caster to have to make a concentration check to sustain a spell.
rpg,3e0hhp,bkelly,15,Tue Jul 21 00:35:13 2015 UTC,Not at all. In fact I think you came off a little too easy. Those penalties don't seem all that harsh. In fact I think they add a little more flavor to the pc.

At 3rd level they have no built in access to any sort of ""bring back the dead"" spell.

You said that he died due to the other PCs inaction, and that he felt the cleric should sacrifice more. I think he wants a larger sacrifice on part of the cleric than on part of himself.     Honestly, this seems like the perfect opportunity for Pelor to turn against the cleric. Claiming to worship a Sun God but using necromancy to create a creature of darkness? Sounds like a path to redemption story if I've ever heard one.      It could be a driving force of a story arc. It's feasible for Pelor to remove the cleric's powers until he proves himself again - maybe returning his powers in stages 1 level at a time. Some outcomes of this could be a final demand to slay the abomination of a necromancer, or a blessing and return to full ordinary life, or something else entirely.     I feel that something as big as dying and returning to life should make huge waves."
rpg,3e0hhp,annoyedandgame,2,Tue Jul 21 08:09:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, uh, considering the alternative is just dead-dead, I'd say you're being pretty easy on him. If he doesn't like it, he can stay dead.  If he rolls up a new character, make sure it's a lvl 1 character, too."

Like some otehrs, I think you let him off easy, really. Just point out that raise dead is normally only available to much higher level characters, he's lucky to still be playing the character.   I love the drawbacks (why wouldn't a necromancer like those drawbacks? they seem to fit very well!). Plus, you can tell him if he doesn't like them, he can always search for ways in game to cure them. Nothing needs to be set in stone in an rpg.  I'd also consider this a learning experience. Many players will not be happy no matter how much you go easy on them. So, often, it's just better to let things stand. If a character dies, let them stay dead unless the players come up with some means to bring them back. Because if you try to be nice and make it easy to bring them back, they'll still complain and make you feel bad."

You begin the game sitting with your friends around the table, playing a roleplaying game, when the events of a supernatural apocalypse suddenly erupt around you. From there, you’ll navigate the streets of your own town and beyond, fighting hostile animals or hiding from cultists as you gather the supplies you need for survival.   Hell no. Heeeeeeeell no.  My GM already did that to us years ago, playing ourselves through the early beginnings of a nuclear holocaust. It was a fucking nightmare, I had never suffered such anxiety and emotional distress outside of actual IRL problems. Never again. I still have painful thoughs about it sometimes."

Playing as yourself in a familiar setting around people you know dearly makes the RPG experience extremely stressful and emotional.

At the time we lived 800km apart and it became obvious that I would never see her again. Because as my friends pointed out, there was no reason for the group to start travelling such a distance during an apocalypse just for MY sake. What about THEIR loved ones ?  Seriously. I LOVE tough decision making, and games that wreck my emotions and engage me. BUT through the faint filter of a character. Not even a superhero, a regular joe is fine.

rpg,3dxqdc,TorsteinTheRed,6,Mon Jul 20 12:03:55 2015 UTC,"First, it's good to see I'm not the only one who had that thought while listening to this album.  It's pretty easy to see why you're having trouble coming up with things. The Electric Castle is less of a puzzle/encounter setting and more of a test of character. You see the characters encounter obstacles, then sing about their past, and either draw the strength from that to carry on or get lost in reminiscence and die as a result. That's easy to do narratively but a lot harder to do at the table.  If you're wanting a more traditional tabletop experience, I'd say a go with a combination of Expedition to the Barrier Peaks and Ravenloft. Take the basis of Ravenloft (spooky castle, no easy exit) and instead of zombies and skeletons have the weird sci-fi shit from Expedition (keeping the vague descriptions of things so as not to say ""ray gun"" or ""robot""). In the very likely event you aren't playing AD&D, you can still take the trappings of those modules and run with them."

Example: ""I must show the Barbarian that my way of warfare is superior""  And then you somehow reward the players, when they act upon that sentence.  Depending on the system, it'd have to be solved in different ways. But FATE points, Bennies (Savage Worlds), Hero points (D&D) all have the thing in common that they let you reroll. Other things you could reward the players with for playing to their beliefs is XP.  But its most important function is of course to invite conflict drama, and driving the story forward.  Another equivalent are the bonds in Dungeon World."

Any allied NPCs that were worthwhile I just made a wildcard and lesser ones were just extras.  The biggest thing about the difference between an extra and a wildcard is the wild die.  However, since your sniper buddy needs to make shooting rolls and the TN for shooting is always 4 (barring modifiers), a d8 in shooting will be good enough without the wild die.

Most of the advice here indicating that a few nasty run-ins with the Mythos are fine, are assuming that you have some veterans in the group who will be calling out predictions anyway. It doesn't sound like you have that problem.  I think most CoC players will agree that you never want to be replying ""yes"" to the question ""does my character know what that thing is?"" That fear of the unknown-- both for the player and the character-- is something they get to share. Unlike D&D, where you can always say ""but I'm a hero!"", the players will actually get the opportunity to sit and think ""what would I do in this situation"", because the player and the investigator are not really that different in power level.

If you have any players that aren't fully studied in Lovecraftian horrors, I'd be loathe to squander the gift. After all, an awful lot of Lovecraft's work has made it to the mainstream.  The rules assume characters know nothing and has a mechanical effect when they do start learning the Way the Universe Actually Works (i.e. Cthulhu Mythos skill and limiting of max sanity).  If I had story that relied on veteran investigators that already understood their insignificance in the the face of existential threats, I guess I'd make them take a random insanity, roll 2d6 or 3d6 and give them that much Cthulhu Mythos skill % along with losing twice that in starting sanity."

rpg,3dx4hl,zombiebunnie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:22 2015 UTC,I've played characters with a little mythos knowledge and it can work. I found it best when the PC knowledge was still very incomplete and mysterious rather than academic. The GM would drop me a few hints but never explain things properly. Of course I told everyone else I was an expert. It helped that I had run CoC myself so it made it easier for me to not have to pretend to know nothing.
rpg,3dx4hl,xipetotec1973,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:14:51 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite CoC methods is to take a different 'modern day' game (Spycraft, etc.) and insert CoC Mythos into it. The players start with no knowledge at all and not even the expectation of supernatural happenings. This works best as a one-shot.   Since the players know they are playing CoC, they will be on the look out for the supernatural horror elements.  Having anyone with Mythos skills might ruin any ""Oh it was just the cat"" scare moments you have planned.  Every Call of Cthulhu game I've ever played I've enjoyed the more than others is when I am playing a regular ol' joe character - a detective, a photographer, or cab driver - who gets caught up in this bizarre world."

The entire game can be boiled down to ""Conflict of Interest Simulator"" because the most important part of the player's character sheets is something called ""Beliefs"" and the GM's sole purpose in life is to see just how far your PC believes in that. Those moments when players get to choose if their belief that ""even the smallest people matter"" really means something when the player is stuck between only saving a family of peasants or his own flesh and blood brother.

The rest of the system is all about having players describe their intention and then how they want to do that and the GM gives the target number of successes. (Intent: Open the door safely. Task: Igor the Rogue will trace the frame of the door with his gloves looking for traps.)  Successful rolls means your intent comes true. Unsuccessfull rolls means your intent just doesn't come true EXACTLY how you wanted. Perhaps you unlocked that door safely---but a monster heard you!

rpg,3dxuwr,PartyMoses,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:06 2015 UTC,"A consistently rewarding device is to make characters make difficult decisions. It can be as cliche as A) shoot the guy just bitten by a zombie or B) chop his arm off to try to save his life, or as complex as backing a political faction in a cloak-and-dagger campaign.   I've got a character in one of my campaigns who had stated, openly and forcefully, that he intended to assassinate one of the political figures of the setting. Even though he wanted to, there was always something more immediate to do, and the party was working toward emancipating an enslaved population. So at one point, I had a false-flag assassination attempt on this political leader he'd sworn to kill that appeared as though it came from the enslaved, and he was the only person who could stop it. So I leaned his desire for her to die against his desire to make good on his efforts thus far, and the result was a lot of swearing at me, but some pretty great character growth. He chose to save her, but the implications of that decision haven't come to light quite yet.   I've also talked with players and whipped up secret or personal objectives for their characters to fulfill. Having a stated goal, like ""I want my character to be free of debt"" gives me, as GM, a lot to play with. How far is she willing to go to free herself? Will she compromise her ethics? Will she abandon a different goal? The only way to find out is to engineer those situations in front of her and see what happens.  Depending on game mechanics, setting, player dynamics and group makeup, even the idea of working toward tough decisions completely changes the way you approach the game, IMO. I would much rather force a paladin to make a conflicted decision than just throw a combat encounter with a tough CR at them.  Mileage varies, of course."
rpg,3dxuwr,mrhoopers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:17 2015 UTC,"I'm currently experimenting with building your character as you play. So I had my players start with empty skill trees. When they want to do something I'll have them explain why their character would know that. If you have a solo campaign you could even have them role play them learning the skill in a ""flashback"" way. Driving a car? When/how did you learn? Dad taught you? Great. Take 10 minutes to walk through that interaction. Roll to see if you get the clutch to work right. Roll to get the shift right. It doesn't have to be action packed. Just have enough variability to it that it helps define the character's history. If I pick ""driving"" from a list it's nowhere near as interesting as actually ""learning"" it. Also, you really can only do flashbacks like that in solo play without boring others since it's so individual.  Or maybe have them explain the first time their character had to kill someone. Then role play that out. You can make it as tragic or exciting as you like then embellish depending on how you see it going. After you killed that guy his brother tried to kill you (role play) you killed him too.  Hope it goes well!"

Look to other games that offer mechanics that change things up.   Burning Wheel, for example, Luke Crane's design philosophy there was all about including mechanics that help move the narrative along and support the story, as in providing a mechanic for narrative elements that previously didn't appear in older games.

I wanna be able to introduce NPCs whenever I feel like it, add annoyances and foes when it feels right in the story my players create with me.

rpg,3dxg2w,a_sentient_cicada,3,Tue Jul 21 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"Right, I did play numenera, I do understand that system. But there is a crucial difference in how both system work, like you said its the other way around. But that does have great consequences. In Numenera, the system is never limiting. Neither to the GM or the players. The GM is free to do what ever he wants and he rewards the players for dealing with the problems he presents their characters with. Its more or a less a ""bad things are happening, but here have a small token of hope so you don't feel to bad about it"" system. It adds to the game.   The system you are proposing takes away from the game instead. For both the GM and the players. The GM becomes limited in what he can throw at the players, he doesn't have free reign to tell his story, instead he has to work with what the players give him. For the players it becomes limiting, because reducing the amount of resources the GM gets to fuck you over with becomes your goal in a game that should be about roleplaying characters and not so much think about the implications your actions have in a meta-game kind of way. It can actually prevent players from doing something his character would normally do because it punishes them for it.   Now of course, the Numenera reward system does not create tension by itself, something you want to achieve here. I don't have a solution for that, but you might wanna rethink your current approach, because so far the system is only limiting without rewarding good roleplaying and good GM'ing."

If my players want to split up into smaller groups and do different things, do I need to keep track of all the different TIME, or is it measured as a ""party resource""?  This seems to lose a little of the narrative needed in spooky RPGs; what about times when the GM has no TIME, and the situation calls for something that would require TIME being spent?

rpg,3dxvk8,Attempt23,5,Mon Jul 20 12:54:02 2015 UTC,"My most run one  My most run scenario is for WEG Star Wars, and is a basic story where the starship suddenly drops out of hyperspace due to a mass field where there should be none, with a rogue planetoid acting as a Sargasso sea for starships.  They always need to hunt through some ships for some spare parts, going through a variety of puzzles and encounters before they encounter the big finish - a livestock butchering droid that has gone haywire and doesn't care too much whether stuff is sentient or not.  The most recent one  The questline I've done most recently is for Shadowrun, and one I was very happy with. It was basically a struggle between a machine intelligence and an intelligent hivemind parasite from Mars, with the player characters as semi-unwitting pawns. Worked very well, and had a couple of twists in it to keep the players on their toes.  My most epic one  It's a bit hard to choose - but I've got two or three good ones that were suitably epic.  In one, for AD&D 2nd edition, the questline ended up with the mandatory battle with the nemesis. And the party mage casts his Magic Missile spell. And the missiles shimmer into being - and then promptly strikes the caster! The 'whaaaaa....?' expression on the player's face was priceless.  I then pulled out some Scrabble tokens, and spelled his mentor's name. And then I started switching the letters around, ending with an anagram of the mentor's name - but it was actually the name of the party mage's nemesis, mentioned in the player's backstory.  The rest of the fight - complete with summoned demons and so on - was furious. At the end, I think I had one party member standing, one dead, and the rest unconscious. It was pretty good.  In another, D&D 3.5 this time, I was a player. The quest line ended up with an encounter where the artifact was successfully assembled by our enemies - and with an artifact name of 'Godkiller', you knew it was going to be bad news.  Blaze of glory moment was when my Evil (only Evil guy in the party) sacrificed himself to power the impromptu ritual to blast the artifact apart again.  Guy may have been LE, but he was still a defender of the Primordial Mound (god was Ptah, we were fighting things with a Far Realm connection), and the only other caster that could fuel the ritual was at full hp.  And with just a knife to use, I was pretty sure I wouldn't be able to take him out with one stroke... so I had to take out my own guy to facilitate the spell.  It worked, though. And I had a glorious moment where I stunned the whole table - including the GM. Was nice.  Then, there was the Street Fighter campaign where my players ended driving hell-for-leather through a closing portal in a Kubelwagen powered by magic, while a newly risen Martian abomination fused with Hitler was erupting from a pyramid, and then the Vril bomb went off. Good times, that one too.  Ah yes, battlestories. They're nice. Hmm... I should work on getting some new ones this summer."

I'm of the opinion that the only thing it does is drive forward character progression and narrative in a more real way than any traditional experience system. I'm interested what gave you this impression though."
rpg,3dye9q,PrimarchtheMage,2,Tue Jul 21 09:15:42 2015 UTC,"1) It's a whole lot of dice tracking. You have to keep track of which die size each TRB is, every success and failure of every roll for the whole session, which dice are what on a single roll, and what your modifier is. All of this for only the chance of small bonuses seems like too much paperwork to be worth it.     2) Some parts are unclear in Fallout. When you ignore multiple rolls, do you mean you only take one of the multiple for that TRB? How do you decide which one? You said earlier that TRB dice don't directly affect successes/failures, so do you mean you track the success/failure of the total test and mark it next to the rolled TRBs, whether or not those in particular were successes/failures?     3) I dislike the pendulum-ness of Fallout. The better you did in session, the more penalties you suffer at the end of it. It seems that this will result in a wave-like pattern of back-and-forth losing traits and gaining them over and over again as the players to 'too well' and so lose stuff, then do 'badly' and gain stuff.     4) It doesn't appear to be focused on player agency. The dice fall where they may, and there's a distinct chance that they may cause more harm than good and that chance is not dependent on the player. Fallout is entirely dependent on chance, since you're rerolling all of the dice again and so the player can't accurately keep track of how well they're going to do at the end and play their TRBs to push past a tier. In addition, the players don't really get to choose how their character is going to evolve. The dice choose for you and the ways will often not make sense.     I think you should take a look at Burning Wheel and Torchbearer's Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits system.      Basically you can always choose when to invoke a trait. If you do it for a positive effect or don't at all then so be it, but if you do it on purpose to get in trouble you gain xp. At the end of each session players literally vote for what traits other characters have that they feel don't apply anymore, and what traits characters don't have that they should. This part gives no XP itself. Traits themselves don't get stronger or weaker over time, they are simply there or they aren't. Your character is that way, or they aren't.  With Beliefs and Instincts, the player chooses what they are and when to invoke them.     Simply put, I don't think a system like this can replace a traditional experience system, it's simply too different. I'm familiar with the SWN ruleset and it doesn't seem too bad, as the players still have to spend time and credits to increase their skills when they level up. If you want to, you could take another Burning Wheel/Torchbearer mechanic, which is that the more you use skills (and psychic powers) the better they get, and port that into SWN. You could keep levels as they are, but simply only have them affect HP and Saves. I don't know if you are, but you'll want to always use the fail forward philosophy if you do this, meaning that 'nothing happens' is never what happens even on a failure, so that players are less likely to 'grind' rolls on a thing."

rpg,3du175,DeathMonkee,11,Sun Jul 19 21:52:35 2015 UTC,"I imagine it would be fun to wedge an Og game into a different setting...  I've run it twice. The first was a fairly typical setup. The cave flooded, they needed to find a new cave. It was a 10-person group, and after the initial setup they pretty much ran the game themselves with lots of grunting, pointing, and shouting. I just threw in the odd dinosaur here and there.  The second game I ran was a bit more intricate. It was about the cave society's first ever rock concert. I had about 10 players again (Og is good for large groups, I've found) and handed out cards assigning roles to each player. Bandmate, roadie, or groupie. One of the groupies stole something from backstage that the band couldn't go on without. The roadies had to find out which groupie was the thief. Meanwhile, the band had to write and perform a song by the end of the session, only using the words they knew.  It was one of the best games I've ever run."

I love the game, but the wizarding can get very crunchy, so I can understand why it didn't catch on outside of a (Very) devoted fanbase. When it works, though, it really works; the companions/grogs system gives you a new perspective on the game world (We have a set of grogs each, rather than a communal pool), the dice system is nice and simple, and the magic system is the best ever published. The setting's a lot of fun to play in, with plenty of scope for adventuring or politics-ing.  The WoD links are only in older editions, nowadays Ars and WoD both have ""Orders of Hermes"" but the explicit links have been retconned out from both sides."

There's even an example of how to build a ""shut off the sun"" power for fairly modest points, followed by a blurb about ""don't do this, it isn't fun for anybody.""  I think it requires a lot more narrative buy-in from the players, and a willingness to work the GM on making characters that won't break the story."

rpg,3du175,Corund,3,Sun Jul 19 22:30:28 2015 UTC,"Well if you have any hard dice at all, you've a nx10 set already made. At least in the last godlike game I ran, one pc (pre-statted from a module) had, I think, a 3x10 Area harm. Generally the npcs had 5 or 6 dice in their pools, so he would go first and pretty much kill them all. They wouldn't be dead outright, but with 3 kill and 2 stun (from the area) to their heads, they're unconscious and he can just kill them.    Why wouldn't I build npcs the same way? A hyperskill in shooting with 4hd and the always goes first ability murders a pc a turn.    Leaving Godlike aside, we used the Enchiridion rules from Reign to run a sci-fi game, and our GM ended up head shotting three PCs because there was no reason for him not to. It was very deadly. That game didn't last very long."
rpg,3du175,trudge,3,Sun Jul 19 22:35:33 2015 UTC,"I'm in a Reign game now, and the hard/expert dice are much less of a problem there because you're limited to just one.  There aren't any auto-headshots going on.    The attacks are still pretty deadly, and fights are plenty threatening.  My character very nearly got killed by an arrow the head - it was only his wooden helmet that saved him. However, that headshot was simply luck rather than an NPC with multiple hard dice in Bow.  So far, we've had zero PC casualties, but we're only 5 sessions in.  OTOH, I ran a Godlike game several years ago based around the French Resistance, and it just chewed through PCs.  Even non-powered soldiers were a threat - a mundane MG-next blew a PC's arm off.    The game got incredibly paranoid, with a lot of the action focusing on the PCs trying to set ambushes rather than falling for them.  It seemed appropriate for the subject matter...  I think Wild Talents mitigated that to some degree, but it still looks pretty deadly."

rpg,3du175,priestofghazpork,37,Sun Jul 19 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"Unknown Armies. A modern occult game by greg stolze. Its the strangest setting I've ever seen. It has a incredibly easy system and character gen takes about 45 minutes the first time you do it and about 15 from then on. The players are either members of or getting dragged into the occult underground, the loose association of adepts, avatars, criminals, and people tht are just in really over their heads. The schools of magic are brilliant for thier weirdness factor alone. Example theres a cabal of gay mages that practice a kind of magic based on keeping secrets that actively oppose gay rights because its hurting thier ability to do thier magic. (they use to get power just for being in the closet now that being gay isnt as stigmatized they dont get nearly the same amount of power for keeping their orientation secret). Plus theres all just rhe weird ahit in it like the two pages or supernatural rumors your characters might have heard. The cannon orginizations are pretty cool too everything from a billionaire's secret army to a group of people that work at macdonalda so they can put magic randomly in peoples food so as to increase the amount of magic in the world."

rpg,3du175,sord_n_bored,14,Sun Jul 19 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"Here's one not mentioned in this thread.  Tenra-Bansho Zero. It's an old-school RPG from Japan that was recently translated into English. It's sort of what Exalted wishes it could be fluff-wise, and FATE wishes it could be rules-wise. It does a lot to balance that line between narrative and mechanical RPGs. Relationships between characters can be a little mechanical, but that's what everyone complains about when they play DitV/Polaris/Sorcerer anyway.  The game takes place on an edo-period Japanese style super-continent. It's all very 90s anime-ish in that grimdark and violent sort of way, like how LotFP is a European grimdark fantasy game. You've got cyborgs, magical parasites that give you powers and living dolls made of wood.  The kiai/aiki/fate system can take a good minute to wrap your head around, but once you get it you might like it. It's basically a way to balance FATE tokens, XP and PC-NPC interpersonal relationships without having to rely on players making stuff up. Probably not a problem for people who don't play DND et al and nothing else, but worth mentioning."
rpg,3du175,sord_n_bored,4,Sun Jul 19 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"I tried this once, and I had a really hard time figuring it out. Is the learning curve as steep as I was making it?"
rpg,3du175,Korochun,5,Sun Jul 19 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it's one of the steepest learning curves I've ever experienced in all my years of gaming. But no more steep than 2nd edition D&D, so if you grok'ed thAC0, saves, etc you'll get TBZ in enough time.  There's a little illustration in the rulebook that explains it simply though. You get sins through roleplay, you spend sins to add dice to your actions, those spent dice are then spent to change the nature of a relationship when you next encounter it, changing the nature of that relationship affects roleplay and causes sin. And the cycle repeats again. When the cycle repeats you get XP, and you can never have more than 108 XPs.  Aside from that the rest is pretty simple. Attribute = # of dice rolled, Skill = difficulty value of that die. And make sure you don't mix archetypes that won't work. But that'd be like everyone making fighters for a social campaign anyway, it's hard to do.  EDIT: Spelling errors/grammar"
rpg,3du175,jackson6644,11,Sun Jul 19 19:27:23 2015 UTC,Heavy Gear. The setting is extremely detailed and well made.
rpg,3du175,Korochun,8,Sun Jul 19 18:03:00 2015 UTC,"Two things I loved about this game:  First, the mecha are like 8-9 feet tall, not the 30-plus you often see. A pilot climbs into a tiny cockpit that makes up the torso of this thing, and while he's certainly outperforming infantry on the battlefield, he still needs to watch out for the lone soldier with a bazooka/rpg, and is going to run for cover from just about any armored vehicle. The idea of mecha that didn't absolutely dominate the battlefield was a huge draw for me.   Second, the logistics built into the game, particularly regarding the building of different gears. Unlike games like Battletech, where every battlefield role gets its own completely unique design, the armies of Heavy Gear reused one or two core designs again and again with modifications (like real armies do--look how many humvee variants there are in use). Between this and the size of the Gears, it made the whole thing a far more immersive game to play."
rpg,3du175,Lance_lake,5,Sun Jul 19 23:42:11 2015 UTC,"Just as a minor point, most Gears are 10-16ft tall. An Iguana can probably do 8 in a crouch, a Weasel can do 7 if it drives. But most are significantly bigger and bulkier. Good overview, though. Combined arms is the core essence of HG combat. At its core, it's a very hard sci-fi setting, unlike, say, Battletech."

rpg,3du175,R4nd0mH3r0,10,Tue Jul 21 00:59:22 2015 UTC,"TORG. Without question. It is the only pen and paper RPG that adequately resembles a core part of cinematic drama: the heroes are at their most powerful right when they need to be, with the villain in sight and when all seems lost. Almost every other game has resources (hit points, spells, drama dice, karma points) that are spent to get deeper into the session. The characters are most powerful right before they've done anything, and surviving a session is a game of attrition.  TORG fixes this with the Drama deck. The deck handles initiative, unexpected plot twists, and actually makes it so that less important scenes are less challenging, where the Final Encounter is when everything seems to go wrong, building tension. Standard scenes provide opportunities for the players to draw additional cards while taking actions, and play the less powerful ones from their hands to sculpt a strong hand to support tactics and dice rolls for that last big fight. In Dramatic Scenes, a player can have their ""moment of crisis"" where the camera zooms in, and all the focus is on them, any cards they receive from other players support and leadership actions as well as their entire hand can be dumped to support one big roll.  The music swells, the villain is about to escape unless that one-in-a-million shot strikes true. The hero lines up his aim, hearing his good buddy say ""You got this, kid,"" the love interest says quietly ""We all believe in you."" No one takes a breath as all the years of training come down to this. This. One. Shot. It hits home, and the world is saved.  In TORG, you can do that.  It also handles many on one or one on many combats with an elegant, one-roll system, and their values are logarithmic, so they can handle anything from the damage of a pocket knife to the damage of the Death Star. I loved the system enough that I've run a few things not related to the multiple-realities-invade-Earth setting that is default for the game."

The premise is that there's an obscure island nation in the Mediterranean called Al Amarja, and everything weird eventually ends up there.  It's riddled with conspiracies, and most citizens are members of at least two.  Game play is generally investigative, with secrets layered on secrets, and the secrets are weird.  Character creating is fairly open ended.  You write down three traits to describe your character, and assign some dice to them.  Traits could be usual RPG stuff, like ""I know kung fu,"" or more out there stuff, like ""authorized personnel"" (you know those doors that say authorized personnel only? my character can go in there) or ""I am the manifested desires of the Parneaux art museum.""  I'm in a game now, and the party consists of a shop keepers who is secretly a master criminal and even more secretly from the future, an immortal swordsman who turns tricks because he lacks modern job skills, a dog with human intelligence, a ghost with oddly limited possession abilities, a chaos chemist, and a telemetrist whose powers only work by breaking things.  Our adventures have included: blackmailed by a bureaucrat to hunt down shapeshifters, breaking a techno-pathic hacker out of an insane asylum, investigating a case of apparent angelic possession, and hiding from gangsters with trained baboons."

rpg,3du175,Grumblepuffs,5,Sun Jul 19 22:28:17 2015 UTC,"Feng Shui.   An Hong Kong action movie roleplaying game by Robin D. Laws where most of your characters are very much badasses on a mission to protect time itself before the future or the past is changed by the power of feng shui by different conspiracies.  Lots of kung fu, gunplay, and some sci/fi-swordsman fantasy elements abound.  Chow Yun Fat, Anita Mui, Jackie Chan or Cynthia Rothrock among a slew of others back in the 1990s were making movies that this stuff lovingly takes copious notes from.     Like all good cult flicks it got a new edition in the form of a sequel most recently which is well worth picking up for a more updated look at the HK movie scene since then as well as some more western references here and there.     Gameplay revolves around the use of stunting, using character schticks, and funky magic powers.    The rolling system is a pretty basic 2d6 system with some possibilities of exploding dice depending on situation.   Dramatic hooks propel the protagonists forward despite maybe being two days from retirement - being the old backstories we know but keep enjoying because they were damn good ones and still are.     Keep your gun loaded, your sword sharp, and your spirit strong: you're ACTION MOVIE HEROES and that's just how you do the kung fu you do so well."
rpg,3du175,Grumblepuffs,13,Mon Jul 20 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"Mine is Ironclaw, by Sanguine Games. It's a super-simple, and yet super-flexible system--classes and races both consist of three skills you get bonuses to, and three Gifts (~=Feats) you gain. Actually, most things that aren't skills are Gifts, including, say, the ability to cast magic, to dual-wield, or to have an NPC sidekick to order around.  It also has a really neat modular design, where the rules for using a Gift are contained in the Gift itself; this means that the rules are exactly as complicated as necessary for every given character. You don't need to know the rules for Flight, for example, unless your character can actually fly.   Also, the damage system is a ton of fun. Every character has about  five HP, but damage doesn't stack; you only suffer the effects of the greatest single hit you've taken so far. Further, each lost HP point comes with a status effect that makes it easier to hurt the target; they might take extra damage, be forced to flee the fight, and so on. If you manage to deal 6+ damage, the target is overkilled, i.e., brutally murdered in such a way as to make all nearby allies Afraid. This might seem a little simplistic, but as character get stronger, they gain more and more ways to dodge, soak, or nullify damage; they don't gain more HP, they just get harder and harder to hit.  Now, the one drawback of Ironclaw is that it bills itself as an ""anthropomorphic RPG""--that is, a furry RPG. This makes the elevator pitch a little difficult, but the RPG itself is clean--the word ""furry"" is never used in the rules, and even ""anthropomorph,"" etc., are used exceedingly sparingly. In either case, my group is having a ton of fun, and I've been enjoying my run as GM, too."

But it got licensed for an RPG which is, I think, out of print.  It was about vikings, and monsters that lived under the earth, and maybe about the conflicts between the gods.  But mostly it was about vikings.  The RPG had a really weird play structure: GMing was done round-robin, and the adventuring was competitive.  It was intended to be a rowdy beer-and-pretzel game, rather than a deep narrative game.  Everyone in the gaming group created a character and a mini-adventure.  There were specific rules for the adventure building, like a point budget and a ""two traps and a battle"" structure.  So, every GM took turns, round-robin like, and ran the other players through their mini-adventure.  GMs scored points for harming PCs without killing them, and players scored points for killing monsters and finding loot.    After everyone had run their mini-adventures, you summed up points, and decided who had won.  Then you could decide if you wanted to level up and do another round.

You're employees of SLA Industries, a galaxy-spanning company that owns and sells anything you could ever want, owned by the enigmatic Mister Slayer. You live in Mort City, on the planet Mort, the jewel in SLA's empire... and you're an Operative, something like a cross between an FBI agent and a reality TV star. Your job is to investigate threats to the company and it's property, and ""deal"" with them... because all is not well in Mort City, there are many horrors - both natural, man-made, and anything in between - that seek to bring down SLA. If you do well, you'll get promoted. You'll get to learn more. And you'll get sent on more dangerous missions.  Eventually you'll learn too much, you might even become a threat to the company, and at that point... well, new operatives need mission targets too.  It's a grim as fuck game written in the early 90's by some clearly very angry Glaswegian teenagers, with a simple enough dice system, a badly-organised rulebook, a frankly bizarre set of secrets behind the game's setting (Mister Slayer was the voice inside the head of a young Glaswegian kid, together they created a new universe and moved there, some of the kid's friends are in there as high-ranking individuals, and Mister Slayer is desperately trying to prevent the kid from destroying this new universe from the inside)... but it's just got this manic energy and rage flowing through it. There are enough concepts there for a couple of other game lines. I'd love to play a game about the beat cops in the setting (Shivers), who are routinely looked down on by the public and bossed around like pawns by the Operatives.

At the very most they can simply be described as different. RPGs are specifically designed for fairly specific styles of play. What you are talking about is your opinion. No system is inherently better than another system. Even ""traditional"" systems like Original DnD, Shadow Run, or even RIFTS are objectively ""good"" systems because each of them can offer an experience that is unlike the others.   Honestly it's better to look at each system in a vacuum and only compare them to your preferences. Then, once you figure out that your preferences are not the same as everybody else's, or even that your own preferences can change? Then you will be able to look at each system objectively and see the merits each has to offer.   TLDR: FATE isn't the end all be all of RPGs.

It's a simplification, but the point stands - vertical increase in power is just walking against the treadmill. Your attack bonus increases by +1; monsters now have a AC 1 higher.    A level 2 party can't do much more than walk up and hit an orc till it falls over. A level 10 party should have TONS of tactical options.   Which are lateral increases in power - players aren't as much getting more powerful as much as they can do more things, have more options to tackle problems. This has it's own problems, but is also a staple of the industry.  What I'm specifically talking about are the vertical raises in power - numbers getting higher. To-hit bonuses increasing against increasing armor classes, damage increasing against higher hit points, direct numerical points.   There are no environments that you can throw them in to make them work for the win?   This has absolutely nothing to do with the argument at hand. If you want me talking about encounter building (including stuff like dramatic questions, methods of ""winning"" the encounter that don't include smashing things until they're at 0 hp), search my post history.

The noble-bright everything-is-morally-black-and-white paladin learns that there are shades of grey and explores the idea that sometimes you have to do bad things for good causes? That's character development.   Character advancement, in my mind, is characters learning how to do new things.  Wizards learning new arcane secrets, Warlocks delving deeper into their pact with an unholy being, Fighters learning new martial moves as their swordplay increases towards the legendary, Rangers learning how to walk across snow without leaving tracks, Alchemists learning how to make new and different potions? That's character advancement, your character can do something new.  Leveling up and your attack bonus increases by 1, your AC increases by 1, and your hp and damage increase (while the monsters have 1 higher AC, their attack bonus increases by 1, and their hp increases while their damage output increases)?

As much as I appreciate Fate's emphasis on imaginative interaction with the setting, I find it much less satisfying than playing out a tactical challenge in defined conditions. Hopefully I have some control over those conditions due to my actions. But I can't just make something up, use some clever roleplay, and win that way. I have to use the tools I came with. |  To me, that is a much more rewarding challenge."

A boardgame's hard to use for that. A boardgame might let you make friends with the amorphoids and goblins living in the city so that you can sneak into the citadel-spaceship of their demon overlords...but after you've done it the first time, it becomes a mechanical process. RPGs keep things fresh and interesting."

Not every one system is right for everything, and they're all not right for every player."
rpg,3e11c7,Quastors,3,Tue Jul 21 03:27:15 2015 UTC,"More rules means more game. I find rules light games get pretty stale after a few sessions/campaigns (different things get stale at different rates) FATE/PbTA style characters end up feeling like caricatures of characters with little depth pretty quickly, because any depth which lacks game significance tends to bleed out of characters pretty quickly. I've found that typically characters in these kinds of systems have a trick or two which they attempt to use whenever possible, rather than acting as more well rounded people.  Simple die systems leave very little space for mechanical improvement, meaning that zero to hero style campaigns can't really happen without the system breaking at some point, or being contorted around the current power level of the characters (which means they don't change, the rest of the world changes around them) This also makes it hard to have large differences in different realms of capability.  The lack of well roundedness is a big one for me. When there are very few things which govern the mechanical capabilities of a character, there are very few things they can be good at, leaving the rest at whatever baseline is used for that campaign.  There's also not a whole lot of game. Action and combat sequences cannot have terribly complex resolutions, because the rules don't have the granularity to cover those things in depth. Simply put, there are far fewer possible states of a ""narrative"" game than a ""traditional"" one. (A simple example would be an Apocalypse World character's 6 wound states vs the dozens to hundreds of possible wound-states in a more complicated game).  Typically, rules light games have very abstract mechanics, which I find makes them feel as though the world of the fiction, and the world of the mechanics are very divorced. The fiction begins to feel less as though it is happening, and more as though it were being written, or voted on by players-as-observers. With well-definined mechanics which directly control the narrative the game becomes less about player a character and more about jointly writing a narrative. This is probably the big one for me.  To a certain extent, most of these problems can be mitigated by a good GM, but this creates a lot of extra work, and every GM will inevitably skip back to the same several resolutions which come to mind easily.  I've played a lot of pretty simple and narrative games, but they've never been able to hold my interest for as long. I really enjoy them for one-shots, or other short campaigns, but I find it hard to sit down and play one for a long time without it getting boring."

rpg,3e11c7,Lakstoties,2,Tue Jul 21 03:27:54 2015 UTC,"Because there's a certain fun to systems with heavier infrastructure.  For some people, system mastery is a big part of their enjoyment.  And playing the rules against each other in a mutually interesting way can be quite the crazy, fun experience.  Then taking those same rules and warping them into crazy creations that you get to try out with everyone else's is great, too.  Also, while some folks are able to adapt on the fly and be flexible with the social contract on how to regulate the game, many people like the shelter large rule systems provide.  It's comfortable in how it is there for you.  There's a agreed upon standard and it is written down for everyone to see.  And that standard covers A LOT of things, allowing you to focus on playing the game rather than making up the game.  For me personally, I like the medium weight systems.  I've even made my own that satisfies my desires.  There's a enough structure and mechanics to feel substantial enough and provide a good core that everyone uses, but...  It's not restrictive or limiting overall, rather it just gives a really foundation to build upon.  For comparison:  Rules light:  You got the deed to the property; it's just plot of land.   Rules medium: The plot has a big square concrete foundation laid, and water and electricity is run out there.  Rules heavy:  There's already an existing two-story house there and two-car garage...  There might be a pool in the back and hot tub.    No one option is better than the other, but what is useful to you depends on what you what you want.  Some people maybe just want to camp out in the wilderness, while others want a house ready to move into."
rpg,3e11c7,Threess,2,Tue Jul 21 04:20:57 2015 UTC,"My best advice would be to encourage you to look into getting some time around the table for games that aren't FATE. Personally I think every rulebook has different areas of focus.  No one game can accomplish every aspect of an RPG perfectly and that is why most groups cycle games and systems in and out.  Some games are crunchy, some are slim, some are combat focused and some focus on narrative development.  For any setting or any overarching campaign concept you can change the system and achieve a very different game from the same exact story!  Look at Evil Hat Productions games, they have a variety of games that result in a completely different experience.  I would challenge you to pick up Don't Rest Your Head and drop it into the FATE rule system and achieve the same type of heart-pounding intensity.  The knowledge that to succeed you must bring your character to the brink of insanity or worse and the dice system drives that narrative home in a very real way.  And that is two games produced by the same company!"

The more rules a system has the more ways you have to interact with that world.   I play Iron Kingdoms a lot, and it's one of the crunchier systems out there. When I sit there and micromanage my gold to be able to keep my steamjack fueled makes me feel like I'm really taking part in an economy.

FATE's got a few baked-in premises, like a focus on narrative, shared universe creation, a core cast of characters, and exploring the characters' backstories and tying those in. Those are legit premises, but they don't jive with what I want out of games.  I like games where there's a hard cold universe and your PCs could easily die if they're unlucky or not careful; they're not Big Damn Heroes by default. I like games where the GM generally has a very strong vision of what they want their setting to be like, so that they're passionate about what they're bringing to the table. So my preferences tend towards things like Traveller and B/X D&D and BRP. That doesn't mean that FATE is a bad system, just that it's not a good fit for what I generally want at the table."

It can be overwhelming, having that kind of control over the narrative, and some players and GMs prefer a tighter leash, so to speak, when it comes to players' control over the narrative.   With the right group, I prefer Fate, but it's not as popular as the more traditional systems, so I tend to stick with the traditional stuff, occasionally working in Fate-like elements. I like Fate's connected character generation and world building stuff, and I plan on using bits of that for my next campaign, and also plan on homebrewing some Fate point-style things in lieu of DnD 5e's inspiration mechanic."

A lot of it is about squad-based tactical gameplay that at a fundamental level is about solving combat-based puzzles as a team. It's a turn based strategy game.  People who love strategy gaming are going to enjoy the challenges that the crunchy, tactical type games present. FATE and the more narrativist games present very different problems and are definitely closer to the ""improvised theatre"" sort of roleplaying.  Both are enjoyable, but the RPG field is broad.

There have been plenty of times that I've asked players what they want to do and they can't tell me because they don't know what they can do. I'd love to give FATE a try, but I know that my party isn't ready for it yet. Therefore, I stick with more structured systems for now."
rpg,3dv3ct,AirborneHam,6,Sun Jul 19 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"In a fragged empire setting I am running for my group, in between sessions I write up a newspaper front page as well. They get it through their communication relay in their ship. If the players have done something major or more likely, been part of something major, it will get a mention. More likely, they can use the newspaper for plot hooks and general setting information.  They receive said front page at the start of each new session."

Most of them will detail the goings-on of the factions and things the players did that caused waves. I will always include one 'new' article about a planet, group or situation that hasnt been encountered yet in either the news or sessions.      This could be a first-hand account about the seedy cyberware chop shops of Alcathous, or the artificial planet built to be a vacation resort - complete with robotic servants.

There's also a notice board to drop in more obvious hooks, and the entries that go up on here are dependent on what happens during play and the discoveries that emerge at the table.

I'm branching out a bit and doing things like writing a few paragraphs from in-world books, journals, articles, etc about events that are relevant as well.  I'm not the best at on-the-fly improv and world-building (I'm getting better over time, I think), so this gives me a chance to add to the story in ways that I wasn't able to in-game.

rpg,3du7kx,prodij18,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:58:38 2015 UTC,"This. Some players, especially new ones can get caught up in their immediate obstacles (the enemy right in front of them), and miss the greater context and seeds for roleplay and character development happening around them. But luckily there's no reason you can't bring it up in meta to be sure they understand the situations. What they do with these  roleplay seeds though (ignore them, or jump on them) is their call.  I will say I play in an evil campaign and wouldn't let that slide in the least. In fact there's a time honored tradition in that group of accusing each and every member of not pulling their weight, both after and during battle, often regardless of their actual contribution. Just last night (different campaign) our nearly blinded Shield Knight, while trying to attack into a grapple, broke my Swordsman's arm and knocked out our Grappler, and we did nothing less then accuse him of gross incompetence, worthlessness, and outright betrayal the entire night. Good times."

You have every right to be angry in character but if you are legitimately mad at the person for an action the character is taking then you should take a step back and think about that. It's not rational and it sounds like the person had good reasons for what they did. So if you are going to confront (that could be an awesome roll play moment) them make sure it's your character and not you."

I was more surprised that the party had virtually nothing to say about his actions, despite that it nearly killed them. My concern stems from the fact that the party is relatively new to role playing  and by the characters that they have established you would think they would be livid (but I guess its not up to me to play their characters for them). I guess I'm nervous that they are not responding in character in an effort to avoid conflict with their friend the player."

rpg,3dtqw1,deltadave,3,Sun Jul 19 13:30:22 2015 UTC,"I understand that feeling, as a big fan of the tactical rpg video game genre. But for pnp rpgs I have learned to look at it from an opposite perspective due to my experience with Burning Wheel and other more narrative focused games.   Instead of encouraging tactical thinking, I think mats end up making players think about things in more of a 2d way. Players will end up looking at the map, and see the grid, and just look at it like figures on a grid, and how to maximize damage in areas and things like that. One might say this encourages ""tactical"" thinking But it discourages awesome risky gamble moves as well. It reduces the amount of cool in a game. Those games also then lead to horrible rules in game systems, like attack of opportunity, to facillitate the top-down strategy version. Tactical thinking doesn't really work in my head either, because the player has a different perspective from the character. One is thinking first person, the other is thinking top down, this creates more of a disconnect."

I personally don't like things like crit cards and other aids, I feel like often you should just be able to do those things, and the system should have rules to compensate.

Inside the first I keep about 30 4x6 blank index cards, dice, pen, pencil, marker and paper clips.  Since I don't use minis the mat is no problem. I write on the cards - location aspects, npc names,  zones, etc - and then throw them on the table for all to see, or hang them on the top of my gm screen so the PC's can see at a glance which NPC are present. The paper clips are for tagging aspects so we remember which ones have been tagged.  The second box is my world box - it has more index cards with NPCs organized in alphabetical order, locations cards also in alpha order, scene cards, thread cards and more blank cards to keep notes on. If you can't tell I'm a big fan of index cards. This box also has a bag of tokens tucked into the back, either poker chips or fate tokens.  A great backup game is Fiasco.

They are the main opposition for the British Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.  Speaking of which, here is the British Ministry: http://forum.theonyxpath.com/forum/main-category/main-forum/the-new-world-of-darkness/hunter-the-vigil/577-conspiracy-mi18-the-ministry-of-ungentlemanly-warfare  They are a group of British spies and bureaucrats who are armed with mad science gadgets that would make james bond drool. And as I said, this is the same group that Sir Lee was a part of.  <breaker>  As an aside, most psychic powers and abilities cost willpower; and willpower can be a very precious commodity, which can lead to powers not getting used very often or not as often as players would want. One fix that helps with that is this, just figured I would suggest it. There are a few other fixes, but they are a little more drastic, more for if you intend to have a psychic running alongside full supernaturals(ie werewolves, vampires, and such).  ""Inherent Style""  To clarify, a guy over on RPG.net made a little homebrew game called Xia, where some of the cool supernatural wuxia powers were marked with ""Inherent Style"". Basically, if you were using them to do something you could accomplish anyway, they were free. If they give you some mechanical advantage, the price is not waived in that instance.  So, to use Telekinesis as an example: if you want to pull a nearby remote to your hand so you can change the channel, it's free even if you haven't activated Telekinesis for the Scene. If you want to move furniture or something, cough up the one Willpower."

rpg,3dtf17,ashlykos,3,Sun Jul 19 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"Coming up with unique, distinct voices for every character is hard, but there are lots of easy things you can do to head in that direction.   Pitch: you can control the pitch of your voice. Pitch it high for some characters, pitch it low for others. You don't have to go falsetto or anything- your natural vocal range has a lot of room in it. Pacing: simply altering the speed at which you say words has a huge impact. A character that… talks… like… this has a different feel from a characterthattalkslike this. Word choice: it's not just how you say it, but what you say. Simply using the right words for the character puts a lot of character in them.   The final important thing is that the players aren't going to hear the exact tone you're saying, they're going to hear a difference between that tone and the other tones you use. So pitching your voice just a little higher, you objectively still sound like a dude, but because it's different, and because you said, ""This character is a woman,"" you're going to sound like a woman."

To get the full effect I reckon you would need to stay in character most of the time, somehow making it clear to the players (without speaking) what they are really up against. That'll be an interesting and funny contrast.  Or do you mean that the GM would completely lie to players, so that the box of gold they found turns out to be rocks later on? I can't see that working as the character actions might not make sense in hindsight if they knew things that the players don't.  How about the idea of players contradicting the GM?

That said I think using this style for a campaign might become tiresome however I'm a big advocate for using different narrative styles within a campaign. I employ flashbacks were one player will take on the role of GM and tell a story from their backstory, with the other players taking on the different characters within their story. These are usually quick and narrative based. The player telling the story might want to employ an unreliable narration style.  I can see this style employed in a similar fashion where the players might be absorbed into a bards tale at a bar. The players would take on the role of the characters in the bards story with the elaborate narrative not matching the realities that the characters are facing like you described. One of the things I would do in this is have some information that is important for the characters to tease out making for a much more engaging encounter with the bard as compared to just asking the bard questions.   I like this idea of using an unreliable narrator. I might even develop an encounter around this idea and post the results in the coming days."

rpg,3dqbd5,szthesquid,30,Tue Jul 21 03:54:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's an interesting idea and I don't mean to sound hostile, but an unreliable narrator sounds tricky and potentially disastrous unless the system or game is built specifically with that in mind.  One of the core assumptions of almost every RPG system is that the GM is a neutral facilitator, reporting to the PCs what they see and experience through their characters' eyes. The GM's characters can be unreliable, but the narration and reporting of events are understood to be neutral and unbiased.  When the players can't trust the information you're giving them, they have no way of knowing if their actions and choices are justified, or even make any sense at all. You'll run into situations where players regret their actions, or resent you for them, because the players are operating on false or incomplete information that their characters should have known. If you tell the players ""you don't find any traps"" and they walk into a trap, well, they should've rolled higher on their search check, or not trusted the result so much. But if you tell the players ""there are no traps"" and then they walk into a trap, they'll probably be upset, and justifiably so. When the players can't trust that what the GM is telling them is the truth of the game world, from their point of view, any action they take is basically surrendering their characters to the whims of the GM.  Personally, if I'm expecting a regular game and the GM says ""don't trust anything I tell you in my role as GM because I'm playing an unreliable narrator"", I'm going to walk away. I'm there to have fun, and I don't find it fun when the consequences don't follow logically from the premise. If I understand from the beginning that sometimes there are traps when the GM says there aren't, that's different, but it still runs the risk of a ""gotcha"" moment where the players couldn't possibly have foreseen the consequence."
rpg,3dqbd5,mirtos,6,Sat Jul 18 14:03:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Although this is more of a hypothetical thought exercise (I'm not certain right now how I'd go about doing this, but I have some ideas), it would of course necessitate player buy in. Without that trust there's no game anyway.    You would need to be consistent, and retain impartiality when it came to mechanical questions, but be loose with everything else. Again, I'm not even sure how it would work, but giving the players some control over the story being told about their character is a must."

Maybe in the context of solving a murder mystery seeing something impossible happen and later examining the place where it happened and discovering the secret behind the magic trick might be fun.  A second scenario is that the player character sometimes sees hallucinations in the form of imaginary people that have conversations with him but are really manifestations of his subconscious.

An unreliable narrator would present information not just as what the characters observed, but as the factual truth - which might not actually be the factual truth.

""You don't find any traps"" addresses the characters, and means the PCs didn't spot any traps, but they might have missed some. There's a possibility, however remote, that there are traps that were too well hidden for the PCs to spot. If the GM says ""you don't find any traps"" and then the PCs trigger a trap, maybe they should've looked harder, or maybe the traps were really well hidden. That's just how the game goes sometimes.  ""There are no traps"" addresses the players directly and means there are no traps. Not that the PCs may or may not have searched well enough to spot potential traps. Not that they got lucky and failed to trigger the traps. Just straight up there are no traps. If the GM says ""there are no traps"" and then springs a trap while saying ""unreliable narrator, shouldn't have trusted me"" that's potentially a pretty big issue."
rpg,3dqbd5,darksier,10,Sat Jul 18 21:41:09 2015 UTC,"An interesting part of this is how could a DM speak in the first person when describing the actions of others?  An important part, I think, of unreliable narration is not just the information being skewed but how it is skewed.  People emphasize, deemphasize, or exaggerate details based on how they perceive the situation when reporting it to others or themselves.   From a DMs perspective it would then be presenting the players a world through a particular skewed lens. Though the player's characters have their own perspectives and thus would have a view of the events juxtaposed to the lens you place on events.  As long as you're consistent it just builds a different language with the players, as they'll learn what they deal with as opposed to the skewed scale you provide. Otherwise, it obfuscates information and leads to a breakdown in communication. You'd also face the issue of ""Who is so powerful or important that their perspective redefines the way the world is perceived by the players?"". So it's a thin line to tread.   Another way of doing this in a way maximizing player agency, is providing incentives to the players to skew the scale and descriptions and give them a chance to narrate some scenes.   Say, in the previously provided dragon size exaggeration. You use the stats for a wyrmling, and tell them ""There's a dragon. Hey dude, your character has never seen a dragon before, right? What does your character see it as?"" And provide a system of glory XPs for people to over exaggerate things. The greater the foe, the greater the challenge, and if they perceive every foe as apocalyptic in scale and they give really cool descriptions for actions then they get extra XP. The dragon causing the dungeon to shudder and crumble with every step is always awesome, even if all they really fought was a baby dragon and a loose torch.   There is also the Dark Souls method of having little direct information presented and NPCs all provide skewed information on shadowy events to build a sense of unreliable narration without lying to the players outright. This solves the issue of which interpretation of the world is valid, and allows the players to become their own unreliable narrator, constructing an interpretation that skews their behavior."
rpg,3dqbd5,megavikingman,6,Sat Jul 18 13:29:11 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of maximising player agency in that way. I was thinking that the GM/Narrator would have to be a character in the story, and not necessarily one who is present from the very beginning, so there should be consistency of narrative voice.    I'd go further, and let the PCs (possibly through a resource mechanic) change the narrative. ""Wait, that's not what happened, I don't know where you heard THAT story.

rpg,3dqbd5,TheNerdySimulation,8,Sat Jul 18 19:45:06 2015 UTC,"Story time!  I played in a game once online, for a long time, where the GM played an NPC who was the narrator of the story. The framing device was that the game we were playing was a storybook being read aloud by the GM's character, a mythological king, and he was reading to his children (us, the players). Throughout the game he would outright lie about what happened in previous sessions. He'd give a minor xp bonus if you picked up on a lie and called him on it. If not, the story would continue as if the lie was truth. Another cool thing he did was institute a system of ""Legend Points"". Whenever you managed to do something cool (like land an epic crit that killed a boss or something) the player would be awarded a legend point. At any point in the story, we could interrupt him and say, ""That's not how it happened!"" And spend a legend point, then dictate the scene to the GM, or reveal some SECRET POWER our character had, and save the day. These had the effect of turning a normal fantasy game into something fantastical and story driven. All our characters developed these amazing Mary Sue Backstories, but it really fit with this theme of storytelling, especially along the lines of epics and hero tales."

rpg,3dqbd5,meridiacreative,6,Sat Jul 18 23:03:44 2015 UTC,"You face three substantial problems here I think:   This runs the risk of being a thing that makes everything more fun for you. It lets you, the GM, direct things even more than usual. This is a dangerous road to go down. You don't want your game to become ""story time with the GM"". Unreliable narration still has to be coherent. It doesn't work to tell the players something, have them react to that thing, then pull the rug out under them because the thing you told them wasn't true. The actual events weren't unreliable - the people in the true story were reacting to the true events, not to the unreliable narrator's version of the events. You need to be careful not to mix the unreliable story and the true version of events. The main purpose of unreliable narration is to introduce irony - to have some sort of, usually comedic, dissonance between what was said and what actually happened. This is dangerous for an RPG campaign because the most common way to achieve that dissonance is for things to have actually been much less exciting or less heroic or less epic than the narration made it sound. But those are all things you want your game to be! You don't want to describe an exciting thing and then turn to the players and say ""but actually, the real version we're going to play out was much more boring"".   I can think of a few ways you could do this and keep it more fun:   You can't substitute the unreliable narrator for the second/third-person narrator. The players still need to know what actions they should be reacting to - it won't work if the players think they're reacting to the unreliable narrator's description, but you're actually having the consequences of their actions affect the real situation, which you haven't described to them. That's frustrating and unfair and not very fun for anyone except perhaps the immature GM who gets some sort of joy out of ""tricking"" the players by literally lying to them. There are two ways I can think of to do this well: (a) preface each scene with an unreliable narration and then give the real details and play out the scene (the narrator says ""Then the mighty heroes came upon a fearsome dragon guarding a beautiful princess."" then switch to the real scene and say ""You walk into the small cavern. When your eyes adjust to the light, you see a single lizardman holding the hand of the princess. She doesn't look particularly threatened or unhappy."" and start playing) or (b) play out the scene, then have the unreliable narrator ""summarize"" it unreliably (essentially just reverse the scenario in (a)). Option (a) affords you more opportunity to structure things for maximum irony, option (b) affords you more opportunity for creativity and reacting to what the players end up doing. If I wanted to do this, I would probably do this for just one session or one adventure, not as a central concept for an entire campaign. You can leverage the comedy in #3 above to great effect and I imagine the novelty and humor would be enough to keep it fun for a single session or adventure. I think it would become grating after too long. One other possibility is to do the reverse of what I think you're getting at here. Don't have the narrator tell an unreliable story and the players go through the real story - have the players play out the epic, fantastical story that the narrator is telling (which will be more fun for them) and inject humor by then narrating to them what ""really happened"".   I could definitely see this as a great way to inject a one-shot into the middle of a campaign. The players finally reach the old sage who tells them the story of the legendary Five Heroes. You hand the players new character sheets and they play through that story as those characters. But the old sage is an unreliable narrator. So either he tells the story and the players go through the ""real events"" as he tells it (which basically functions as a ""reveal"" for what really happened, contrary to what the world thinks happened, with the added bonus that you're constructing the reveal through gameplay as you go, which is pretty damn neat) or you play through the ridiculous version of the story he describes (everyone gets to play overpowered characters in a crazy story of unrealistically incredible badassery) and then what ""really happened"" can be a reveal later."

So every session would start something like: ""Hey guys, remember that time we ended up fighting that red dragon?"" ""Oh yeah, man that princess was such a cat!"" ""Man, remember how that night started with us going to find some nobles cat?"" The GM can take the role as the bard or other non-heroic character that follows the group around and somehow manages to make it out OK. For split ups, you could just step out of that character and narrate like you normally would. Everyone can give commentary IC like, ""What did you do then?"" or ""Man, that would have been cool if you rolled all those barrels down the hill at him"" ""We must think alike, because that's exactaly what I did.""

Later on the party split up, and the PC paired up with an NPC to explore some ruins - they were ambushed by a load of animated skeletons who caved in the NPC's skull before the PC could take them out.  And so the adventure continued, with the NPCs dying off one by one to a series of tragic accidents and brutal ambushes. None of the other PCs encountered any enemies, but they just assumed the possessed PC was unlucky. At one point he found a kitchen (in a long-abandoned castle) stocked with ""magically preserved meat"", which he decided to turn into a stew; with a natural 20 on the cooking roll, the rest of the party were very impressed, and talked about how delicious the meal was.

Of course, the people who found these dice would not have a problem with rolling them and causing horrible/hilarious/world breaking things to happen.   Not to mention the players would probably do the same.   It would be a very meta-game and though it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with your idea, it kind of does...maybe?

Then you could rotate the point of view each telling - at the end of the first session the barbarian is telling the story, then at the end of the second the mage interrupts and takes over the story.

I think it might be difficult to run a long campaign like this, but it would be great for an adventure or story arc:   PC'S have to solve a mystery by going into someone's thoughts (like in the Cell). Circumstances keep changing as the person tries to recall events. They have to figure out which scenario is accurate. PC'S  have to find a sleeping god. As the god dreams, reality in the surrounding area is constantly being altered.    Or whatever."

'And then we faced a giant green dragon and slew him with narry a thought!' ...actually you're fighting 6 kobolds wearing a giant green sheet..."
rpg,3dqbd5,TotesMessenger,2,Sat Jul 18 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"Great idea, but very iffy in practice.  Unreliable narrators are fantastic in single-author, single point-of-view fiction, but a game is a collaborative effort, and that's a tough element to reign in with an unreliable narrator.    I don't know if I'd attempt it myself, but if I were going to, I'd probably limit it to a limited campaign rather than something ongoing, and rather than being unreliable in constant context, be unreliable in the overarching details.    Here's my idea.  Plan two sides of the same campaign, both set as either one-shot, or maybe up to three sessions each.  From the start, set it out as though there's a conflicting story that is being investigated.  For example, let's say we're going with a modern setting, and there's been a string of murders.  You have the city police investigating on one hand, and they've got a suspect they think is rock-solid.  State law enforcement has also been conducting an investigation, believing that City's suspect is a frame-up, as part of local corruption.  The FBI has been called in to sort the mess out.  So in alternating campaigns, your players play as all of the above.  You start them as officers with city police, have them called to the scene of the crime, maybe see some action there, feed the players evidence that leads the case to this suspect, ending their campaign at the arrest.  Then you bring in the State police, who are investigating corruption, again played by your players.  You give them different evidence, implicating some of the police force, seemingly exonerating the arrested suspect, and casting doubt on the entire investigation.    Then once both of those are completed, you have your players take over as the Feds.  Review evidence, follow new leads that pop up, and eventually sort through this labyrinth of corruption, probably on both levels.  You add a new layer of complexity to the narrative as the players figure out more and more about what goes on behind the scenes.  Keep them guessing:  Was my captain in City police feeding me wrong info?  The gun used in the shootout at the crime scene was a missing police-issue firearm; was the guy we encountered there a cop sent to plant evidence, and then covered up later?  Or is it the state police that have a corrupt higher-up, who is manipulating the case to try and keep the killer out of prison so that crucial info isn't leaked?  And make it interesting.  Give the players options to use unorthodox methods in the investigation, bend the rules and such.  Make it so that the reward for doing so is substantial, but not necessarily greedy (we don't have enough evidence to hold this guy overnight, but he really does seem like he's about to crack and talk).  Depending on how well they plan and make their rolls, the better this gets blended into the investigation, and less likely to come out later.    Generally speaking, this isn't perfectly in-line with an ""unreliable narrator,"" but this way you keep your players from having to play a ""bad guy"" directly, and instead have them manipulated by a corrupt organization (or maybe two corrupt organizations).  That way, the unreliability isn't in the players themselves, only in the motivations for the actions they're set to take on, and they get to experience this unreliability first-hand.    Just some thoughts!  By the way, if you haven't read Gene Wolfe, that dude is the king of Unreliable Narrators.  Give him a shot."
rpg,3dqbd5,nunboi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"I like this idea a lot. It's not what I had in mind, but it's certainly a really good way of using the idea in practice. I like the idea of playing through the same investigation from different angles with different clues, revealing different evidence to heighten the sense of paranoia.    Re: Gene Wolfe, I haven't read any of his stuff, but I always meant to read the Book of the New Sun. Any other books you'd care to recommend by him?"
rpg,3dqbd5,-Ryoshi-,2,Sat Jul 18 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"New Sun is a solid recommendation.  It was my introduction to Wolfe, and I wound up loving it, though I'll point out that I didn't start out loving it, but that seems to be an initial hurdle to reading Wolfe.   Other good starting points:    Long Sun, which is a sequel of sorts to New Sun, but mostly stands alone, and is easier to follow the surface narrative than New Sun.  It's a bit gentler of an introduction.    Peace is a standalone novel, and is a devious bit of a puzzle, and so is a good way to jump into the deep end of Wolfe without the time investment of the longer series.  Neil Gaiman famously described it as being a gentle Midwest memoir on the first reading, and only became a horror story on the second or third time through.    If you're feeling brave though, going through the entire solar cycle (New Sun -> Long Sun -> Short Sun) is immensely rewarding.  You won't be able to stop talking to people about it."

The characters are hired to kill an enemy in the dungeon.   I've seen a lot of GMs here be frustrated when players decide to pause half way through a dungeon and rest because they've blown their resources, and it used to be a problem that plagued me constantly. Having a specific goal besides, 'clear the dungeon' forces the players to fight on or risk failure.  If you were sent to kill the Sorceror, when you stop to camp for eight hours he doesn't have to wait around for you. If you were sent to retrieve an object, maybe when you rest for the night one of the kobolds runs off with it. Having these sorts of constraints creates a sense of urgency that is often lacking when a party is simply tasked with clearing out a space."
rpg,3dqk8n,OnionDruid,4,Sat Jul 18 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"I like doing it the other way around.. sort of.  I like to start with the over-arching story - the motives, the antagonists, their history, and so forth.  Not a novel or anything, just noting down a few ideas, then mess about with those ideas until it all starts to gel together.  Then I start to look at what locations might be involved, what would be there, why would they be there, what are they doing, and so forth.  Then finally, you build that location.  I'm taking a leaf out of the Skyrim dungeon building book and giving locations a little history - it's one of the most subtle but best bits about Skyrim.  You might go to an old dwarven temple, but it's been occupied by goblins for the last 10 years.  So it's an environment that's in flux, it makes locations feel both more real, and more lived in.  I also like how in LMoP each location has a 'thing', something unique that makes it stand out from a game-play perspective.  So as part of all the above, I'll be thinking about what it could be.  Maybe the whole cave is flooded.  Maybe the owners of the tower you've come to kill are out, and they come back with reinforcements so you become the defender.  Maybe there are two factions already fighting within the town.  Maybe there is a cavern with no floor and a rope bridge to cross, with flying enemies lying in wait.  Maybe the grass has grown really tall around the ruins, limiting visibility.  And so on.  It's a little twist that makes an ordinary dungeon just that bit more interesting.  In terms of actual layouts, I tend to cheat and just search online for building plans, cave systems, and so on.. then roughly copy it and adjust to my tastes / needs.

I would always give everyone a set amount, unless they did something particularly heroic or had some in-game reason why they would gain something (and then the points would go strictly to that).  Raising their power level, however, is not the same.  Probably a good idea to let them ""grow sideways"" before ""growing up."""

rpg,3dry2o,Andvarinaut,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:16:11 2015 UTC,One thing I'll put down here because I see it too often: don't have your players trade hero points for power points ever.  In D&D terms it's like letting your casters turn in their unused spell slots for XP at the end of a dungeon. It's not a good idea.
rpg,3dqx3d,Ungrade,10,Sat Jul 18 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"It's not much different, honestly. A campaign is not much more than a series of oneshots joined together by featuring the same main characters and a thread of story.     Talk to your players about an interesting premise and setting, and for the first session think of a minor goal and introductory obstacles in order to get to know the characters and what they are like.     What are some tips and pitfalls of campaign writing? Here are some off the top of my head.     Talk about everything beforehand.   I'm playing a Burning Wheel game and we've spent the past two weeks talking about the setting and characters we want. A lot of different people play RPGs for different reasons and want different settings, characters, themes, etc. Establish early on what the game will be about, ideally collaboratively.     Write a simple plot that won't take long to execute. No plan survives first contact with the enemy, and similarly no prep is unjarred upon first contact with the players. I prefer short-ish campaigns that take a few months at most to complete. Years sound good in theory but you can get quite bored of your characters and story before it's even halfway over.     Don't prep more than the premise and vague ideas.   This is especially important, as the first session establishes the world and the ongoings of it. If you have some ideas but the players do a 180 and do their own thing then cool. Follow that rabbit hole instead and see where it leads.     Look at everything through crosshairs.   There are no NPCs which cannot be killed. If the 'big bad' (which i personally don't even like having, but that's its own thing) is killed, then they clearly weren't as big or bad as they thought.   This even includes your story. If the players decide to travel somewhere else and a bunch of yet-to-be-revealed stuff won't get revealed, think about just crossing it off. Nothing is canon until it is confirmed in game, everything else is subject to change."
rpg,3dqx3d,PrimarchtheMage,3,Sat Jul 18 16:47:59 2015 UTC,"Here is the method I use - far from perfect, better for some games than for others, but at least it works for my group.  First, you need a general idea of the campaign, kind of a tagline, one line description, such as ""After Earth is moved outside the Universe, the PCs have to fight a malevolent entity older than reality"" (taken from my current super-hero campaign). This is what you go back to when you lack inspiration during the game.  Then, divide your story in 5 Arcs, with again a short description for each. I usually have Act I as ""characters meet the campaign's big issue for the first time"", and Act V as ""Final conflict"". Keep it larger than a basic scenario, and open-ended. Again, that's what you go back to when you lack inspiration. In our previous example, we could have:  Act I: The PCs investigate magic phenomenas. While investigating one of them they accidentally help the God of Madness transport the entire solar system outside the Universe  Act II: The Earth being outside the Universe causes worldwide uncontrollable rage in all civilians. The PCs have to deal with all the trouble happening, and start seeing a common thread (the Big Bad)  Act III: The Big Bad reveals himself, direct conflict with his armies. They finally face him but because of Something Bad they end up being scattered across the solar system  Act IV: The PCs go through a journey each on their own to find themselves, and then prepare to confront the Big Bad again  Act V: Final confrontation with the Big Bad  Don't go into too much detail, especially for latter Arcs, as your PCs' actions will change the story.  Aaaand... that's it. I usually also write down all cool scenes I would like to see on a separate page, and update it regularly.  Then, after each couple sessions, I go back and update the whole thing. Update the next Arcs plots based on what the characters are doing, add some scenes ideas to the current Arc or the following one (again, I don't bother with Arcs farther than the following one, since the story might change completely by then), add more ""cool scenes I want to see"" to my list, add some notes for recurring things (for example if a Small Bad Guy escapes, I take a note to have him come back in the following Arc), etc.  One very important thing in my opinion is to already have an end in mind - for each Arc, and for the campaign as a whole. ""We will just keep playing forever until everybody is bored"" is not a really good plan for a campaign.  tl;dr Make a skeleton of your campaign story, keep the end in mind, and focus most of your preparation on the current and near future events"
rpg,3dqx3d,CristolGDM,3,Sat Jul 18 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"Different people do different things. I'm just doing it one dungeon at a time, improvising the main arc, and keeping it weird."
rpg,3dqx3d,Kommisar_Keen,3,Sat Jul 18 16:30:30 2015 UTC,"I usually run sandbox-style campaigns with a sort of overarching plot, building on whatever the players want to do. The exact prep depends a bit on the system, but here's the gist of it.  Establish a space of play. This is the room that the campaign takes place in. This can be a section of a kingdom, a bunch of kingdoms, or as small as a city.  Fill it with things. This means people, cities, interesting things for the players to see and interact with. Go as in-depth as the scale warrants; major places and people should be rather well written out, but individual minor folk and places don't need to be detailed.  Establish the powerful players. This is different from the players in your group; these are the important people in your world, the prominent factions that have some sort of power and influence in your setting. Most of them should start out indifferent toward the players; they're simply not significant enough on their level to really give a damn about.  Iron them out. Give each factions a few prominent NPCs that hold important positions, as well as some of the forward-facing people that the players might interact with. Give each of them an agenda; something that they try to achieve and what they're planning to do with it.  Write up a basic plot. This is something for the players to do during the first session. This should be a self-contained adventure, starting and ending within the scope of the session, much like a one-shot. Think of it as the pilot episode of a TV-show; wrap up the story in the session, but leave some hooks open that the players might want to pursue after this session.   That is the general prep I do before the first session. However, prep is continual; everything the characters do will play into the story going forward, so keep in mind what happens during play and roll with that.  Keep an eye out. Whenever something interesting happens during  the session, write that down. After the session, make something out of it.   When in doubt, listen to your players. If you run into a situation that you haven't prepped for, ask your players something. ""What do you do?"" is the good blanket one that fits most situations, but general questions work well. If the players go into town to look for someone, ask them where they go and how they do it. The more they tell you, the more you can draw from to paint the scene."
rpg,3dqx3d,AManHasSpoken,2,Sat Jul 18 17:49:27 2015 UTC,"Use a published one, if only for ideas and general guideline. I'm playing in a game which uses GURPs rules but a fantasy setting by a fairly unknown indy company but the setting is mind blowing in terms of detail and it also has a free written campaign which we're playing through. We liked the setting but not the game system that goes with it (too many dice rolls), so the GM bastardised the one and dropped the other. Most gazetteers tend to be system agnostic once you chop out the occasional stat block and reference to races so take your pick.  Personally though I'd stick with one shots. I find long winded campaigns tend to turn into an opportunity for the GM to sell you his latest novel or railroad you onto that story he's gagging to tell and if you stick to one shots you can try tons of different games. One week GURPs, next week Paranoia, next week D&D, next week a small indy effort, it's more fun and you don't have to become a bit part in your GM's saga.  It's courses for horses though. Find what suits you."

rpg,3dqx3d,Nivolk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"I prepare a campaign as follows:   Know the area where the characters start. If it is an established world - then read up, but if it is one of my own I need to know a bit about it. Develop a plot or three. What are the hooks that the game starts with. Is the game meant to save the world and last several years? Or just a semester?  Highlight any particular things that I want to plan for... Do the characters search for an epic maguffin? What does it do? How hard is it to find. Do I want to use a signature monster? Which one? Do I shift it from ""normal"" preconceptions or play it to stereotype. Have a few ideas how things can happen. If the PC's find a glaring flaw in my plan and short-circuit the BBEG in the first session, then what is the contingency?   Basically I outline some of the highlights I want to hit, and some interesting details. If this was for a book, this is the planning before writing, but when GM'ing it is the planning before collaboratively crafting the story."

But basically you want some kind of frame that allows two 'sets' of powers, using one at a time. A 'speed' frame, with extra movement, agility, a little extra defense (dodging), and some basic attacks & stunts (power slide/knockdown, drive-by with a melee weapon, a built in ranged weapon or two, superjump over an enemy and getting them all confused and irritated). Something to get the opponents all worked up and frustrated, emotionally invested in bringing these people down, causing the enemies to make mistakes.  And then the real combat half - strength, armor, maybe still a little extra agility and speed, some melee and ranged attacks, maybe some extra sensors / targeting that wasn't available in bike mode. To take advantage of the stunt-based frustration (lowered defenses, or 'stun-based' psychic attacks) from bike mode. Maybe a 'find weakness' ability?"

Basically, there was some wars between Elves and Drow back in the day, and one of the Drow, a sword master, had a very powerful blade with a personality, mainly geared towards ""furthering the Drow cause"" and ""man, screw elves and the goddess Shelyn in particular"".  As the sword put it, he revived his master three times after they got trapped in a cave-in, and then gave up because he realized it was pointless.  The sword laid dormant for many, many years, until being unearthed by the Dwarven and Gnomish families that had built a grand city on top of the ancient Drow civilization.  The sword ended up being sold in a dinky little antique store, where our Magus, a half-orc with a love for Scimitars and the like, came across it.  When he bought the sword, he ended up being possessed for a short while and ended up stabbing the team's DMPC Cleric in the back.  Multiple times.  She didn't stay with us long after that.  Well, I say us, but that was the session just before I joined, the groups ""That Guy"" left and I came in, imagine the shock and horror on my character's(A slightly unstable, paranoid moon elf) face when he found out that the Magus had stabbed a cleric of Shelyn.

Use the ring of jumping from the floor to pile drive two vampires into each other? Roll the d20.

The player had a grand idea that he came up with which was to take a length of rope and run it through with two people on opposing sides, to pull him out. But, because it was impossible for him to relay the message to them as Smiles, they had no idea he was thinking this.   Thus, a completely silly idea popped into his head, after I said he could use his Rage Ability since it is more mental than physical to initiate, where he wanted to use his Will to implant his idea into the mind of his partners. I told him to roll it, because I like to encourage unique and silly ideas, and he rolled a Natural 20. His message was, ""Run a rope between you and the wizard, through the Jelly Cube, in order to pull me out."" I shortened it down to, ""Rope through Cube, me out,"" to be fair.

rpg,3dorf2,Ivan_the_Unpleasant,4,Sat Jul 18 01:36:17 2015 UTC,"Only it really doesn't. It not only reinforces the idea that rules > story, but it also makes it seem like it's okay to try to solve problems with the players by dishing out punishments to the characters.   So actually it creates way more problems than it solves via bad DMing practices."
rpg,3dorf2,blacksheepcannibal,4,Sat Jul 18 14:22:40 2015 UTC,"1) dropping a single trap on a wizard is not really punishment, unless its permanent or some shit.  Traps and tricks are kind of part of reality.    2)  rules > story in this case.  You play a specific rules system for a reason.  Your players have put in the effort to actually learn the system.  Then you just cheat?  Without a mechanical reason your players will see it for what it is (if they learned the rules) and will know youve cheated them.  They will never forget that, and everything from then on is suspect and wont see the point in learning the rules anyway if your just going to break them.  3)  a trap FOR WIZARDS being set off by a Detect Magic spell makes a shitload of common sense.  What's pretty much every casters first spell when they see fancy loot?  DETECT MAGIC  4)  Working within constraints fosters creativity.  Its real fuckin EZ mode to just lie and cheat to get the effect you want.  It's harder, but way more enriching, to figure out a way for it to fit in the setting WITHOUT breaking the rules.  For instance the Detect Magic trigger, or maybe the items cloaked with a small antimagic field disguising the trap.  EZ way out if for players, not DMs  5)  If you're Not cheating then you can OOC explain what happened to the PCs if they rly want to know and rhe players will really appreciate the extra work and intricacys of the trap or whatever. Especially if there was a way around the bad thing they just didnt figure out. If your cheating you cant explain where the extra +6 came from, or why the Orc Warlord had a backup axe built into his throne."

I mean, I'm not sure I agree with him entirely, but his premise seems to be that it's better to just break the rules outright once in a while rather than set this precedent that you have to weasel shit in on technicalities  reason 1: if you're trying to set a precedent that story comes first, this is counterproductive to that  reason 2: it's punishing a specific player character for investigating something and using reasonable caution."

rpg,3dorf2,God_Boy07,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:49:06 2015 UTC,"Good idea but that does seem specifically designed to screw a particular player and may seem like a personal attack outside of game. Perhaps just make the entire area strongly radiate magic so he can't pin anything specific down or even put some sort of anti-magic field immediately around the trap so it isn't detected until they are right on top of it. It's basically the same idea but without the whole ""Oh this player uses this ability so I'm going to specifically target it."" vibe.  As for the question... Breaking the rules for story or to increase the fun/flow of the game is always acceptable but it is best to be clear that it is happening and to stick to the change and maintain consistency. The players won't mind so much if you change the rules as long as you stick to the rules you establish.   Maybe come up with a reason it couldn't be detected and work it into the game... Perhaps a fungus with magic masking properties coated the dungeon walls near the trap."

rpg,3dorf2,Fugaciouslee,0,Sat Jul 18 23:04:55 2015 UTC,"Think about it logically, if you're building a dungeon and want to protect it you're going to put in some traps.   Magical traps are part of the tradition. Trapped traps (traps that are harmless until a trapfinder looks for them) are also tradition.   If you're any good as a GM you never have to break the rules to tell your story.   For the Detect magic trap, rules as written say that everyone gets a perception check to find it (rogues are the only ones that can use a search for them since the perception DC is automatically over 20), A saving throw is also allowed to avoid the effect.  So how I'd design it, an open round room with a thin delicate column in the center, the column is actually more of a stalactite meeting a stalagmite holding a glowing crystal.  All around the column are pressure plates, these don't actually do anything but are there to be spotted.  The crystal has true seeing for it's perception. if you cast detect magic in it's presence it trips. The triggered effect can be anything, but must have a saving throw.  There's also a DC 31 perception check to see the trap before it triggers. anyone can make this (but as a GM I'd roll in secret)"
rpg,3dorf2,chaogomu,56,Sat Jul 18 18:33:29 2015 UTC,"Bending or breaking the rules to serve the story is fine.  Bending or breaking the rules in order to remove player agency isn't.  I feel like your example falls under more of the later, so I would personally feel frustrated if, as a player, some of my abilities just stopped working because the story required me to be temporarily disabled.  That being said, if it was a one time thing with a less experienced gm, then I would just roll with it.  If it was something that happened regularly and the GM was more experienced, then I would probably voice my frustrations."
rpg,3dorf2,WHM-6R,4,Sat Jul 18 01:22:14 2015 UTC,"I largely agree, but the GM could dress this situation up that it doesn't upset the player.  Like, they step on a mechanical pressure plate that drops a lead screen protecting the magical trap.  A little chincy, but it would explain why this one off situation happened the way it did.  The biggest issue is why someone would create such a specific trap in the first place."
rpg,3dorf2,p4nic,4,Sat Jul 18 03:12:26 2015 UTC,"I sometimes introduce things outside of the rules if the rules dont allow for the story, but what the original poster was describing is an attempt to defeat the players. in that case, i dont think it was appropriate.  On the other hand, there are reasons the detect magic could have failed. There is nothing wrong with wanting a magical trap that cant be detected by a detect magic. in fact if i was a person creating traps and i had the ability to do so, id be putting non-detection on all my magical traps.  But thats key also.  Traps for the sake of having traps always is a little odd to me.  They should make sense."
rpg,3dorf2,mirtos,16,Sat Jul 18 06:39:29 2015 UTC,"There are a few things going on here I would like to address.   ""He is a good sport about it, especially since he found out that it let him and the party cut the head off a dragon, but I always felt a little bad about it. Was I right to break the rules and lie to a player? Or did I screw up big time?""  I think you answer your own question here. Did you screw up? He's a good sport. Were you right to break the rules? That's a trickier question.   ""a trap for them where the head of their party would be caught in a magic trap and carted away. Just one problem: he had detect magic, and used it damned near all the time.""  There is nothing wrong with setting traps for the party or even splitting them up for a story. However, if you know this is something you would like to have happen it is important to keep the player engaged. That is to say, the trap should not automatically capture the character or arbitrarily negate the players actions. In this case, the ability to Defect Magic.   In the lands of D&D there are a number of non-magical ways to achieve the desired effect. One possible option might be a mundane pit trap with a somewhat intelligent monster at the bottom who can grapple and whisk the player away. This happens to Gracie Law in Big Trouble in Little China, although, I'm sure there are other less dated references. This does lack the instant effectiveness but it does give the player more control in the scene. If the character is split from his party and faced with a grapple monster it's more than likely you will still archive the desired effect. The player will also have the added bonus of a rematch once the party catches up.   The other thing I wanted to address was this:   ""The party was seriously OP, to the point that I was out of my league and needed to drop them down a peg or two.""  If you are of your depth as a GM, don't be afraid to talk to your players. Explain to them where you are having problems and have a discussion with the entire group. More than likely you'll be able to elicit a lot of good advice and story concepts that will serve your needs.   The other part of this statement, while it may not be the case, there seems to be some frustration towards the players. Not to go all hippy dippy, but, role playing is about the collective narrative. If you feel you need to ""take them down a peg or two."" it may be time to step back in general and ask yourself, are you really getting the experience you want out of GMing?   Hopefully, asking yourself these kinds of questions and engaging your gaming group in a more open dialog will lead to a better overall experience for everyone."

rpg,3dorf2,DJCertified,3,Sat Jul 18 23:35:02 2015 UTC,"Taking the group down a peg or two is like using a super powerful CNC Lathe.  If you know what your doing you can cut the arrogance, foolhardiness and hubris from your group.  Leaving behind intelligent, cautious and creative players who know not everything is theirs to utterly annhillate.  Or done wrong you could slaughter your group leaving them hopeless, mad, and frustrated and when you try to reach in and fix it the Lathe tears you apart.  IMO it takes a really difficult situation, with warnings ahead of it that the PCs ignore.

rpg,3dorf2,legacyman,22,Sat Jul 18 16:31:27 2015 UTC,"So what this comes down to is Player Agency, the fundamental reason most people play RPGs. Its the idea that the players choices matter and have a meaningful impact on how the story plays out. When you break a rule in that sort of way, what you're doing is taking away their agency. Functionally, its equivalent to telling the player they forgot to cast detect magic. Their choice has been made irrelevant.   Personally I'm of the opinion that as a GM, its something you should never do, because you can realistically always tell a good story without doing it. Imagine if the party member had never been trapped in the gem, couldn't the story have been interesting from there? What if they moved the gem somewhere the dragon would find it, and trap him instead? There are always interesting places to take the game while still making your players decisions meaningful."

I agree that players actions should never be meaningless, but neither should it simply be that things always work as expected.    As a player, I would go, ""hmmm, ive never failed to detect a magical trap.  I wonder why this failed.  maybe i can learn new magic that i wasnt aware of?"""
rpg,3dorf2,mirtos,2,Sat Jul 18 06:42:19 2015 UTC,"In this case I'd say the trap trigged by the Detect Magic answers the PAgency problem.

It isnt triggered, maybe it triggers when they rake it to get appraised in the city and now have to free the wizardly shopkeeper, BAM SIDEQUEST and the looks on the PCs faces whem they realize they avoided that trap hitting them, priceless."
rpg,3dorf2,legacyman,6,Sat Jul 18 16:22:22 2015 UTC,"First, I wanted to tell you there was a way you could have accomplished the same thing within the rules of Pathfinder.  Magic Aura  That's a 1st-level spell that alters or outright hides magical auras. The only way to beat it is with Identify or other higher level magic besides detect spells.  Second, you said the party was too powerful so you needed to make changes. It would have been better to talk with that about that outside of the game and work something out. When I mess up, I tell the group and make sure they understand what will be done to fix things. In the long run, I've found it increases their trust in me and my decisions.  One common solution to your issue in Pathfinder is to use more difficult encounters and not award any treasure beyond consumables such as healing potions until things are balanced again. That way you don't continue the cycle of too many items, not enough challenge.  Third, the GM can break the rules. It's almost required in some systems that cannot handle how players actually use the tools they are given. But you need to be careful doing so because it can make the group lose trust in you. Additionally, changing the rules too often or without letting the players know increases the difficulty of making decisions because the players have no idea how things work from session to session.   Fourth, Detect spells can be messed with in multiple ways. Years ago when I ran Pathfinder, I strictly enforced all the time rules and dice rolling so they wouldn't gloss over the tedium of their actions. I know that seems to go against the ""rule of fun."" But not enforcing those rules effectively gives the players free access to spells of a much higher level, which also leads to the types of power imbalances you mentioned.  Fifth you specifically decided to change how something worked without telling the players to pull a ""gotcha"" moment. You say it worked out here, but that's not the common response. The players expect the GM to be impartial -- running the adversaries doesn't require being adversarial. Most players make choices based on how they weigh the likely risks. Hiding risks too often can feel like a cheap trick to players.  Sixth, you decided the story needed to go in a certain decision and then manipulated player perceptions and abilities to force that outcome. That's the fast track to turning a roleplaying game into a railroad. Ask yourself this: If no one had touched the item, would you have forced them to trigger the trap some other way?  Think of it this way. Have you ever been annoyed with a TV show because a character suddenly behaved foolishly just so a specific plot point would occur so there would be something to deal with that episode? Imagine how much more annoyed you would be to play that character, decide to not behave foolishly and still have the bad thing happen anyway.  TL,DR You can break the rules all day long, but if the players don't trust you there is no game. Explain all your changes openly and honestly. When players trust you, changing the rules is just making adjustments for a better game."

I prefer not pre-arranging things so that they have to happen in a certain way. Instead, when I want something to happen, it will happen, but no rules need to be broken, I just need to be flexible and imaginative enough to make it happen.  My problem with breaking the rules is that I know there are players who like to go by the rules, and even if they don't say it, internally they don't appreciate when things don't happen as they should (source: myself as a player)"
rpg,3dorf2,xantub,4,Sat Jul 18 01:15:19 2015 UTC,"Since so many RPGs are built around multiple systems that reward clever decision making, it can really undercut the entire game to change the rules without telling the players."
rpg,3dorf2,ForthrightRay,3,Sat Jul 18 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"People have mentioned removing player agency, which is definitely a thing and generally a thing to avoid.  The big issues are how you do this, if they know you do it, and what happens because of it.  If you do it in a plausible fashion, or if they don't know you bent the rules, or if it's only a minor plot point, you're pretty much good to go. Once you start stretching credulity, doing so in an obvious fashion, and making a significant impact on gameplay, it can be a problem.  The main thing is that most players expect the rules to be a guideline for how the universe works. It's how they set their advantages and win the challenges presented. Rules are what they use to solve the challenges thrown at them. Once you start saying the rules aren't actually rules at all but instead mere possibilities, the players are left wondering where their knowledge and tools will fail them. The next time that player uses detect magic and you tell him there's no magic, will you be surprised if he looks at you for several seconds? Seems extra paranoid about the ""magic free"" area he just checked? Starts taking other precautions that slow gameplay down?  There's two things to keep in mind here:  1- The players are only as powerful as you let them become. If they've gotten too big for their britches, it's because you've given them too much XP and too many goodies. Don't supercharge your group if you don't have serious opposition planned for them already.  2- There's always a way to stick it to players within the rules. Detect magic has a range, so you have to counter that with devious GM evilness. Have a trap door drop him into a chamber with the crystal, the fall being further than his DM range. If he has a counter for falling, have the trap door be over him and the trap dropping the magic on his damn head.  TLDR;  Avoid breaking the rules as much as possible. It sows player confusion and uncertainty which can be frustrating and make for tense groups. Be a sly, devious fucker instead and have them curse your name while longingly asking when the next session is."

rpg,3dorf2,alex3omg,2,Sat Jul 18 16:44:14 2015 UTC,"Well, DM'ing with OP characters is a bit of an arm's race... Whether or not what you did was inappropriate depends not on the system, but on how you bent it.  In this case you lied to a player without any justification at your end--you shouldn't do that, or at least don't make a habit of it, unless you can support the events with other reasons. If the trap was specifically tailored for that character by a villain that knew his behaviors, then it makes sense if spells were in place to prevent detection. If the trap was even just... made to trap mages, that makes sense on its own. Or if the trapping effect isn't the response of a spell but due to an inherent property of the kind of crystal it is. It might take several acts of overt observation to detect even the faintest magic if that was why it was crafted in the first place. If you don't have physical (mechanics) reasons for why he couldn't know, at the least you need a metaphysical reason for it aside of a hand-waive. That is if you're questioned. I'm sure plenty of DMs have lied mercilessly many times without being called on it.  However... lying to a player about what their character knows isn't necessarily 'right' when the only justification was ""he can circumvent this and I don't want him to""... Then it looks, at least to players, like you broke the system to target a specific player for personal reasons. That creates an use-versus-them situation. Some people play well as adversaries with their DMs, but usually its agreed to in advance that the game is going to be hardmode. But pulling that kind of adversarial behavior when you're all together to just have fun? That loses some of their faith in you and can lead them to question anything you ever tell them. Or, alternately, they'll understand and shrug it off. It depends on the players. It depends on the game.  However the best way to prevent this is to know why the world works as it does. Either back it up with system in advance, or create campaign reasons that make sense for why things are as they are. If you know you are going to do it, back it up. If you don't know in advance and it's the spur of the moment, you might need to at least take a five minute break to hash things out."
rpg,3dorf2,Deightine,2,Sat Jul 18 09:18:00 2015 UTC,Sort of? One thing you learn in fiction writing and such is that what you want to do is make rules of your universe and stick with them. But you also want to do things that seem to break these rules but are actually pushing them in an interesting way without breaking them.  Now your trap also seems not to really be for the story. You used it to 'drop them down a peg a peg'. And then used a trap that they should have bee able to notice. You could have set them up with a situation that was a no win. You could have had him detect the trap with no way to avoid it. Or a multitude of other options.  Were you right to do it? Ehhh....yes and no. Did you screw up? Nope. They didn't seem to be too upset.
rpg,3dorf2,Chronx6,4,Sat Jul 18 12:56:52 2015 UTC,"Yes.  So long as your group trusts you to encourage a good story, and they play along, the rules are unimportant.  Further, if the players trust your world building, you can hand-wave almost anything away:  a) the crystal trap wasn't magically ACTIVE, it was dormant, and the exact spell had a cloaking component. b) the crystal was made by a type of magic entirely foreign to the PCs, so they didn't detect the nuances of the device to determine it was magical. c) the Detect Magic spell doesn't just light everything in neon tones and say ""This is MAGIC!"". Rather, it sifts through the world and shows the [words of the spell]/[sound of the spell]/[the components of the spell], whatever. So if you were to detect magic in a magic shop, you wouldn't know what the hell is going on. But if you detect magic in a cave with nothing else magical around you, you can pick out the object easily."

Breaking the rules is probably something that's unnecessary. You can always use the rules to make things happen in most cases. For instance you could have made the trap immune to scrying, or masked the entire hallway with interfering magical auras so the traps magic signature was hidden in the rest of all of it.   Basically, if you have to break a rule, make sure it's not something that players well get grumpy about and give them a little leeway later on when it comes to something that the rules would make a bitch (like swimming in armor or the like)"

rpg,3dorf2,digitalpacman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:56:55 2015 UTC,"My guess is that you misinterpret detect magic. Detect magic doesn't tell you how a magic item works or if something is a trap. It merely allows you to perceive magic auras. A concentrated casting for a few rounds will show what school of magic but that's pretty much it. 5e even made it a 1st level spell to prevent people from being ass holes about it.  In my game I would have players who detect magic a perception check for magic. Depending on their roll and degree of success, I would divulge certain degrees of description. From ""there is a magic aura around this crystal"" to ""there are conjugation magic waves that emanate from the crystal in a concentric pattern"" a subsequent arcane knowledge roll may give the player a clue to what that may mean.  Knowledge is the real power in most games, and this is why meta gaming is frowned upon."
rpg,3dorf2,sandybell751,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:45:47 2015 UTC,"I break the rules as long as its fun. Besides you can always come up with justifications as to why the trap didn't trigger. Maybe it was on a pressure plate, and only activates when separated from the pedestal.   Just one problem: he had detect magic, and used it damned near all the time.   This is why I hate Detect Magic and Detect Evil/Good. I tend to use them differently. Evil/Good detects intent, so if a mass murderer is thinking about what he's going to have for lunch he won't ping, but the carpenter who's pissed off with his boss and entertaining the thought of killing him, despite the fact that he'd never actually do it? He's gonna set it off.  Detect magic for me, is more like dusting for fingerprints. Spellcasting leaves a trace, like a residue, that detect magic spots. The more powerful the magic cast, the more residue it leaves, and the more it sets off the spell. That said, incredibly powerful artifacts tend to have passive effects, so they have an aura around them that the spell can spot. ^^"
rpg,3dorf2,Aiyon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:18:16 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your group as to wether or not they're cool with this sort of stuff. I'm of the school that it's okay to break the rules on occasion for cinematic effect. Big bad close to wiping the last party member, and the attack left him on only one more point of damage before death? Maybe he goes down, anyway, depending on if the party seems like they're engaged and would appreciate it. It also stops metagaming - if something can change against what they know, then they can't just game through knowing what will die when, and how much damage they can take before going down."

There is no GM I've ever played with that follows every rule.  I'm one of the more officious types and there are people worse than me out there.  None of them have ever run a fully strait game unless it was a very rules lite system like 'Everyone is John'.    A bad GM uses GM fiat or hack very obviously and carelessly to force the plot where he or she wants it to go.  A shit GM never fiats anything.

Some people say rail-roading is bad. I think in either case you didn't break the rules in favour of the story but broke the rules to counter power-playing, which some might argue is ok. Personally I think it was unnecessary as you could have introduced any amount of clever and subtle ways to rein in your power players - a psychic virus that prevents use of certain skills is always one I fall back on - but it's tricky to think on your feet so no judgement here."

My groups fight plenty of things that are a lot stronger than originally written down as.  I personally don't have a problem with occasional plot armour. If it's convenient to the plot and player enjoyment for them to be whisked away to fight a dragon, then quite simply, a powerful wizard did it, using [plot item]. How powerful is the wizard? More powerful than the players. So long as you don't overuse it to constantly rebuke the players efforts it's fine. Use it to change setting and quests, don't kill them with it, don't make their efforts useless, just add complications to the objective."

rpg,3dorf2,Yamuddah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:09:27 2015 UTC,"Is it ok to break the rules to advance a story along a certain direction?   No.  Or rather, it depends.  The thing is the people are there to play a particular game.  That game is defined by the sum of its rules.  When I say it depends, what I mean is that the people at the table can all agree that there's flexibility in the rules and then it's fine, but the baseline, logically, has to be no.   I had no real choice but to basically lie    If I was the player in that situation, that encounter would've been a mark (or two) under ""con"" on my GM scoring sheet.  Not to say it'd've decided my opinion of you as a GM (seeing as how it was for friends who knew it was your first time), but rules-breaking railroading is, in my mind, the second-highest violation of the social contract that a GM can make (the highest being metagaming against players).  A good GM is a fan of the PCs who gets a kick out of the PCs' ability to solve problems.  A good GM realizes it's the GM's job to lose, but to make the PCs' victory a very close thing.  A GM's job isn't to tell the story they imagine using the PCs as protagonists - if that's what you'd like in a game, what you actually want to do is to write fiction, not GM.  A writer has control of all the moving parts of the story; a GM only has control of all the least important pieces.  If you have an interesting idea and want to see how the protagonists get out of it, you want to GM - does that make sense?  Keep at it with those guidelines in mind and I have no doubt you'll be a great GM someday.  Enjoy."

You didn't screw up big time because the player took it well, but you did take a risk that you probably shouldn't.

rpg,3dorf2,Teulisch,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:54:18 2015 UTC,"As you have presented it, no, it is not ok to break the rules to punish your players. The rules are an agreement between the players and GM about how their shared reality works. Pulling the rug out from under the players invalidates them, their characters, and their choices.  One of the worst contributions to gaming is this 40 year old GM vs Player crap. The point of gaming is not to win, and if you have to break the rules in am attempt to win, you are playing the wrong way.  With that said, my normal response would be that you should only break the rules to support the players' story, not the GM's. If breaking a rule makes the story better for everyone, then it is done to do as long as you're careful. But of a rule is broken only to support a GM's ego and take the importance away from the players, this is the wrong approach."

The players have limitations on their power imposed by the game's rules.  Your limitations are whatever you think is fair, so this statement is invalid.

rpg,3dorf2,gc3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:33:37 2015 UTC,"The general rule is that you should not bend or break the rules if it is to the player's detriment (e.g. fudging a dice roll so that they get critically hit 4 times in a row.) You SHOULD however bend and break the rules occasionally if it means the survival of a PC in the appropriate circumstances (No player wants to die to the BBEG 2 rounds into the battle.) My general rule is to think about the story, as you mentioned. Would the player's detriment add to the story in any way? Or would it be solely detrimental. If the answer is the latter, then I usually bend the rules a little bit.  As to your specific situation, that to me seemed more like a planning issue than anything else. Every party has a weakness, even if it's one that you've created. When designing challenges for a party, keep in mind all of their relevant skills and talents, but also keep in mind all of their fatal flaws. A min-maxed party especially has notable flaws because they had to cut some corners to make their characters beefy in their own arenas. So if it were me, maybe I would've put the party in a barrier that nullifies magic first (I don't know if that's a thing in pathfinder, if not, I'd make it up!) He'd still have the non-magic members of the party to defend him, but as for his detect magic, it'd do diddily squat, and he'd probably feel less eager to touch that crystal... Or, maybe I'd design a different challenge all together."

It's a book called The Rivan Codex by David Eddings and it's about how he built up his fantasy epic world for the Belgaraid and Mallorean Series (12 books, really solid fantasy, I'd recommend them to anyone who likes sword and sorcery). How he researched his ""races"", and drew parallels to historical tribes and nations, pulled things out mythology and twisted them, and established the minute details of the various places so he could use those little things in passing to deepen the tapestry. Like, he knew the different currency of all the kingdoms, even if it only came up maybe once or twice in the whole 12 book epic.

However, Lone Wolfing and trying to take over all NPC communication is something you can handle.  If he keeps splitting off from the group, then start putting him in situations where he's in danger of embarrassment(and if that doesn't work, his life) from something that another party member with a different skill set could easily handle.  If he's a brawler, put puzzles and locks in front of him.  If he's a roguey/thiefy type, start having muggers and corrupt guards accost him.  If he's a beefy basher, make him jump across rooftops and give him opportunities to offend little old ladies who turn out to be witches who can put a curse on him, etc.  A little creativity in such situations can easily drive home the point that it's a team game.

Don't get too worried about keeping track of all the mechanics: more often than not your games will end up being pretty freeform (besides the occasional Cunning or Wisdom roll to state facts). Just run with it.  It's important also to remember that you don't prep games for B&H/HotB in the same way you prep games for D&D or WoD. Don't sit down and write a campaign. What you want to do is write down three simple premises (1. Another Daimyo is visiting your lord's lands; 2. Both secretly despise each other; 3. You've heard one of the companions of the visiting Daimyo is an assassin with orders to kill your lord). Set up a number of NPCs (the visiting Daimyo, the actual assassin) and then let your players roll their Wisdom to add stuff to those basic premises (""I've heard the assassin has six fingers!""). Maybe write down a few scenes where both groups get together to eat and drink but, other than that, be ready to improvise everything.  Also don't punish your players for not knowing every single little thing about Japanese culture! If one of your players wants to do something totally unSamurai-like, just address the topic out of character and explain how things work in the setting.
