sabres,3e081q,thahamer,6,Mon Jul 20 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"Rayzor is definitely over the U on the shaft. Looks like Holzinger initialed the blade. I think the initials near the top of the shaft are WP22 which looks pretty similar to Wayne Primeau's autographs if you do a Google image search.   I'm thinking the one on the shaft to the left of Ray is Randy Burridge. So if all my guesses are right, this is probably 1997-98 or 98-99.  Edit 2: I think the far right of the blade is Cory Sarich"
sabres,3e081q,jmm57,2,Tue Jul 21 00:01:53 2015 UTC,If it's not Randy Burridge it's Domenic Pittis (could be a 12 or a 17) which would date it 1999-2000 maybe but I agree with Cory Sarich
sabres,3e081q,DrLiam,2,Tue Jul 21 12:38:32 2015 UTC,I think you're right about Pittis. Now that you mentioned his name the capital letters look much more like DP than RB

sabres,3dz4nn,Tubbsie,-5,Tue Jul 21 15:51:04 2015 UTC,He's probably going to become a small time player on the team by the time Gionta retires in 2 years.  It's likely going to go to Eichel or Rienheart and maybe Risto.
sabres,3dz4nn,MrF33,13,Mon Jul 20 20:46:04 2015 UTC,He's probably going to become small time player on the team by the time Gionta retires in 2 years.   Did you just say that about Zemgus?
sabres,3dz4nn,dzhoneeh,3,Tue Jul 21 00:13:06 2015 UTC,I don't know how anyone could say that about Zemgus. He may never be the leading scorer of this team again but he sure as hell won't be a small time player for us. He works way to hard to become a 4th liner.
sabres,3dz4nn,Skyline_BNR34,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:05 2015 UTC,"He works way to hard to become a 4th liner.   Then he'll become an average third liner, but he will never have the same role he had last year.  I know we love him, but lets face reality, he was an average player on a team of hot stinking garbage so we have a slightly inflated sense of his value."
sabres,3dz4nn,MrF33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:40 2015 UTC,"I think you're wrong. It doesn't matter how bad that team was. The things he was able to do last year, against good teams, shows he's far from 'average'.   For further proof, revisit the game against Detroit where he single handily embarrassed their defense."
sabres,3dz4nn,Lanlis12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:36 2015 UTC,"I think you're wrong.   The stats don't lie.  Z-man had a Corsi # of 139, which was good for 370th in the NHL, almost half that of Ennis.  http://stats.hockeyanalysis.com/ratings.php?disp=1&db=201415&sit=5v5&pos=skaters&minutes=50&teamid=0&type=individual&sort=icorsi&sortdir=DESC  His rating per time played Corsi per 60 minutes puts him at 411th in the NHL...  Again, he was fun to watch and a seemingly bright spot for an otherwise awful season, but he's an average player at best.  Maybe that will change when he's not up against true No. 1 players, but he's never going to be more than a third liner on a team that's contending.   For further proof, revisit the game against Detroit where he single handily embarrassed their defense.   Single plays do not make a player good or bad, they're just good plays."
sabres,3dz4nn,MrF33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:00 2015 UTC,"I don't put much stock in those stats, when you're talking about a 20/21 year old kid on a garbage team. He'll continue to improve, and so will the team. I could see him being like Getzlaf, maybe not quite as good, but very close someday. His stats will be much improved this year."
sabres,3dz4nn,Lanlis12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:35 2015 UTC,Seconded.  He was pretty much on a 20g 20a pace until he got injured.  A 3rd liner is way understating.  I'd expect a similar career as Jordan Stall: 20-25 G and A in a 3C or 1/2W role.  It's been impressive how he's made marked improvements every season.  I do think Getzlaf is a bit of a stretch but a 3rd liner is an absolute floor.
sabres,3dz4nn,chirperic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:04 2015 UTC,He was on that pace seeing 20+ minutes a night.  He's never going to get those kinds of shifts on a regular basis on the new team.
sabres,3dz4nn,MrF33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:44 2015 UTC,. His stats will be much improved this year.   I almost guarantee they won't be. Since he's not going to be playing 1st line minutes like he was.

sabres,3dz4nn,624mark,3,Mon Jul 20 21:45:50 2015 UTC,a lot more than 3 have been traded on this list http://sabres.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=36569
sabres,3dz4nn,evilzamboni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:29 2015 UTC,Ugh that list reminded me of that stupid rotating captain system.
sabres,3dz4nn,sexymcluvin,4,Tue Jul 21 04:20:21 2015 UTC,"I'm riding the Zemgus train here. He works hard. Its been said in a bunch of Blue and Gold that he works harder than anybody else. That may change with Eichel around. Plus, I feel like Reinhardt would be good given the work him and Jack are probably doing together. You have 3 highly competitive guys, all with good skills and work ethics. I can see Zemgus getting it because of Tenure, but the other 2 quickly getting the A's."
sabres,3dz4nn,mkelsey4610,4,Mon Jul 20 20:26:14 2015 UTC,"Since Buffalo has a relatively new and young team, I think they might go with naming two captains at first and giving it to one later in the season. I would say one obvious choice is Zemgus because he has been on the team, is a great player, and is also popular among fans. However, they could give it to one of the seasoned guys who are coming into the Sabres from trades and what now. Eichel won't be getting the C in my opinion because he is good (great actually), but the team will need someone with some extra NHL experience. I think it is highly likely Eichel will get one of the As though."
sabres,3dz4nn,thebenson,7,Mon Jul 20 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand giving the C to young soon to be superstars. Just because you're a great player does not mean you are captain material.  That being said, I think based on work ethic and effort put into each game either Zemgus or Foligno should be the next captain."
sabres,3dz4nn,tluck81,6,Mon Jul 20 19:03:34 2015 UTC,A lot can happen in two years.
sabres,3dz4nn,thebenson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:47 2015 UTC,True. It can. But I'm not sure two years in the NHL is enough experience to be awarded the captain C on such a young team. Now is when you need the older guys to reign in the younger ones.
sabres,3dz4nn,tluck81,4,Mon Jul 20 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"I just don't think it will be Foligno, and Gigensons is only two years older than Eichel.  I think they're your top 2.  I'm not even sure Foligno will be on the team in 2 years."
sabres,3dz4nn,thebenson,3,Mon Jul 20 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"Foligno is a character guy and led the pre-game ""practices"" before the games while Gionta was out. He's also an emotional player who will let the bench have it. He's also a local guy."
sabres,3dz4nn,tluck81,4,Mon Jul 20 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"Just because someone is an emotional player and a local guy doesn't make them captain material.  That first part is interesting, but I think to be captain, you should be one of the more top-end players.  That's pretty much a requirement for me.  Foligno's a bottom six player.  Maybe he can get an A, but I never see him being captain."
sabres,3dz4nn,mustacheofgod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that if he's still on the team in 2 years Foligno is a shoe-in for the ""A"" but the ""C"" will be worn by Eichel, ROR, Girgensons, or Reinhardt and that letter will be earned by whoever steps up the most as a leader in the next two years."
sabres,3dz4nn,tluck81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"Probably.  The way I look at it, the Sabres will likely want Eichel to have it."
sabres,3dz4nn,mustacheofgod,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"That's true. After all, you can't spell EICHEL without the ""C"" right down the middle."

sabres,3dz4nn,Skyline_BNR34,2,Tue Jul 21 08:25:09 2015 UTC,Worked with Toews and that team.   That team was very similar to ours. A couple very young players with most players under 30 when he got the C.
sabres,3dz4nn,AvenirDesign,3,Tue Jul 21 00:52:10 2015 UTC,Yep. Put your experienced players and veterans first in line for captaincy. Need the experienced words to come out in the locker room not how much Eichel partied yesterday.
sabres,3dz4nn,MrF33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:24 2015 UTC,"Crosby handled it well, Stamkos handled it well, Tavares, Kane, all handled it well.  If Eichel doesn't seem like he's up for it I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that Rienheart will be."
sabres,3dz4nn,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:10 2015 UTC,Ummm Kane isn't the captain of the Blackhawks. Toews is. And Kane was also never captain of the jets either.
sabres,3dz4nn,tluck81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:27 2015 UTC,I'm sure he meant Toews.  Kind of the same thing.  Toews was one year older.
sabres,3dz4nn,tluck81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, you can not understand it, but those decisions worked out really well for the Blackhawks and the Penguins.  There are different formulas, sure, but it's clearly one that has worked."
sabres,3dz4nn,--Greg--,4,Mon Jul 20 20:50:09 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not Eichel. Absofuckinglutely not Eichel this year or next. There's no doubt a young player can be a leader, but he needs to build and prove a rep first before any letters are considered at all.   He was not a leader in BU's locker room last year, and he isn't the second coming of Jesus Christ. Let's just be happy we have a very skilled player and hope for the best for now."
sabres,3dz4nn,Clapper10,5,Mon Jul 20 21:12:04 2015 UTC,How the heck would you know what type of leader Eichel was in BU's locker room?
sabres,3dz4nn,Skyline_BNR34,3,Mon Jul 20 23:44:56 2015 UTC,"Because he was there, duh."
sabres,3dz4nn,624mark,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:07 2015 UTC,"you can't be the number one guy on a good team and not be a leadership figure, that being said, Im not ready to pin the C on him just yet. I agree that he's got to prove himself over the next season or two."
sabres,3dz4nn,--Greg--,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:51:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Unless he's literally and obviously God's gift to Hockey (especially in terms of Grit and Skill), its probably really offensive to any Vets that a kid who has never taken an NHL hit is a Captain. Professionals or not, I'd bet that's a major hit to any guy who's been there already"
sabres,3dz4nn,tluck81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:07:50 2015 UTC,We're talking about two years from now when Gionta's contract is up.  Take a chill pill.
sabres,3dz4nn,Darth_Millhouse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:37:48 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming OP is asking who will take over in a few years after Gionta leaves/retires. If that's the case then a 20 year old captain isn't that out of the question considering the average age of the team. I'd rather it be a younger player that will be with the team for the long term instead of just giving it to am older veteran finishing up his career. I don't want it to be Georges, Moulson, or Gionta for much longer--none of them are going to be there, or be a factor, when this team makes a run. And, really, they were added to the team during the last two years to hit the cap floor and add some legitimacy to the... Err... Rebuild."
sabres,3dz4nn,Rickysplits,2,Tue Jul 21 06:50:38 2015 UTC,"Gorges seems like he'd be good after Gio. We would still have him for 1-2 years after Gionta, then if he doesn't resign give it to Zemgus."
sabres,3dz4nn,JG2483,3,Mon Jul 20 22:15:07 2015 UTC,"Probably going to be Eichel, but I'd rather Zemgus. He seems like the perfect captain."

sabres,3dz4nn,Darth_Millhouse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of over giving the ""C"" to the recently acquired older veteran.

sabres,3dz4nn,RomanesEuntDomusX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:50 2015 UTC,"I love the fact that after years of having to settle for sub-par leaders and past their prime veterans, we might have an abundance of great captaincy candidates soon :). Don't really care if it's Eichel or Girgs or someone else tbh, just the fact that we have these young leaders already makes me hopeful for the future."
sabres,3dz4nn,tluck81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:16 2015 UTC,"I think if things go well, Eichel gets it with Zemgus and Ristolainen getting the A's."
sabres,3dz4nn,MrF33,3,Mon Jul 20 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"Rienheart gets it before Zemgus, I think Girgensons is going to be getting a much smaller role on the team over the next few years and the shine of him being one of the few bright spots on an otherwise giant turd pile will fade.  Ennis would get it before Zemgus."
sabres,3dz4nn,tluck81,2,Mon Jul 20 20:48:26 2015 UTC,I agree about Reinhart.  Not sure about Ennis.  He would have gotten something by now.

If we're trading for a player of Oduya or Franson's caliber, we shouldn't need to give up any of those players you listed. Very mediocre defensemen.

IMHO Ennis would be straight up for Dman of Top 4 caliber. If we want to go for a big name then it has to be first rounder thrown there as well.   Though I'd say we do not necessarily need Top 4 man for years. Just a guy like Oduya/Beauchemin/Martin etc who can surely handle Top 4 duties for couple of years and we get to see if the kids can handle those minutes afterwards. Can't really name who to go for exactly now, but I'd assume it will be a guy who is a bit older & experienced and has a contract for few years max."

Now Oduya is out of the running I think we should expect to see GMTM pull the trigger on a trade. I'm thinking we'll see some bottom 6 forwards be moved, probably to teams with cap issues.   In my completely unprofessional opinion, this is what our lines should be looking like next year, * Kane-ROR-Ennis * Moulson-Eichel-Girgensons * ???-Reinhardt-Gionta * Delauries-???-???

I think Deslauries is a great 4th line player and bringing in McGinn fills the role that Foligno was filling so one of those two will have to go.

sabres,3de09m,justdubya,0,Wed Jul 15 22:23:59 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure this means he won't be playing for much longer... He's looking for another trip to the finals now and I'm assuming he doesn't think he'll be playing long enough for the Sabres to be good enough to compete in that amount of time.  The fact that he took less money says it all.  Whatever... bye.
sabres,3de09m,Carl_Bravery_Sagan,-8,Wed Jul 15 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"/r/hockey discussion  He even signed for 1.25m less per year. And for one fucking fewer year. It looks like our RHD is substantially stronger than our LHD too. Is it possible to have our D switch sides? Or can we trade a RHD for a LHD? I'd like to try trading Bogo first then Risto then Pysyk if possible.  Finally, and most importantly, fuck you Oduya. I hope Dallas doesn't win a cup in the next two years."
sabres,3de09m,lmg6841,7,Wed Jul 15 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're over reacting. Oduya was a #4-5 defenseman and he's getting old. Just because he'd slot top 3 with us doesn't mean he's that good of a defender. Finally, even on a 3 year deal, he'd just be a stop gap while the team gels. There aren't going to be an deep playoff runs in the time he would have signed with us."
sabres,3de09m,BARDLER,3,Wed Jul 15 15:49:07 2015 UTC,"We should not trade any of those guys. We should be patient and wait for the right deal on a left handed dman.

Isn't there some team out there with the opposite scenario? They have a LHD and need a RHD?  I'm still upset with Oduya, though. We give him a better offer and we get shot down."
sabres,3de09m,TwentyFour7,4,Wed Jul 15 16:38:49 2015 UTC,"For me, Risto and Pysyk are untouchable. Bogo is moveable but I don't think it's necessary. Top 4 LHD is a hole in this roster but let's not make the mistake of abandoning the rebuild. The idea is to mold your young promising D into cornerstones on your team, not ship them for older vets. I think we'd be alright going into this season with the D corps we have now. We're not trying to win the cup yet."

sabres,3db5o7,gregordog,10,Tue Jul 14 22:25:18 2015 UTC,"Seems obvious.  Though I think most believe that he'll be a staple in the lineup for years to come, he hadn't earned a long-term deal.  I figured this would be a bridge......came in a little cheaper than I thought....I figured him for an AAV in the $1.5-2M range."
sabres,3db5o7,Zman5778,2,Tue Jul 14 22:33:43 2015 UTC,"Why? He's RFA. No leverage, not a ton of NHL experience."
sabres,3db5o7,evacc44,5,Tue Jul 14 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"Aye. Though a lot of people are very excited about him and for a good reason he still practically has nothing to use for leverage in negotiations. Good stuff in AHL doesn't mean that you'll be able to do same stuff in NHL. His last season NHL stint, though glorious, was way too limited to give any sort of certainty to perform in the long run.   So while he has all the things going for him at this point of his career he has very little to argue for in negotiations."
sabres,3db5o7,Viihdetaiteilija,2,Tue Jul 14 23:08:43 2015 UTC,"He's the one player (right?) that people mention as a guy we kept in Rochester as part of the tank.  If that were true (I have not viewed enough of his play to have an opinion) then we did sign him a bit cheap, considering we may have robbed him of a year of NHL experience.  (Does his questionable health play into this?)"
sabres,3db5o7,36in36,4,Tue Jul 14 23:40:12 2015 UTC,Wooooooo!
sabres,3db5o7,MikeWeber1,7,Tue Jul 14 22:33:37 2015 UTC,Both sides have to want them.  I bet he thought the same thing.
