VinylCollectors,3dxlgr,informationscientist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:15:33 2015 UTC,Thanks! It can be a bit expensive when shipping to the US. There are couriers which will do it for around £15 / $23 and that's about as cheap as they get. Plus those sorts of companies only have around a 95% successful delivery rate :(  Therefore £21 / $33 is about the going rate for a reliable service.

VinylCollectors,3dw87v,Squirtle07,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:46 2015 UTC,Because he thinks it is.
VinylCollectors,3dw87v,offthewall_77,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:45:22 2015 UTC,well I paid about 150? I'm guessing the value based on the fact there are only 100 copies of these since they come with the test prints.  it's hard to value since there are so few and nobody else seems to be selling
VinylCollectors,3dw87v,offthewall_77,3,Mon Jul 20 02:00:29 2015 UTC,"You paid 120 tops, just like the rest of us. People that buy just to flip for 2X the amount are not good people."
VinylCollectors,3dw87v,offthewall_77,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"that's just flat out not true, $137.50 + shipping that's just not a nice thing to say  not that's it's really any of your business, but I didn't buy it just to flip, I already stated I bought it for myself and now needed money so I figured I'd try selling 350 was just my opening thing, and as I've said multiple times before I'm happy to hear out whatever people want to offer or think it's worth.  to me that's just what my initial concept of the value was.  not sure why everyone in this sub seems so nasty :/"
VinylCollectors,3dw87v,Squirtle07,3,Tue Jul 21 01:30:42 2015 UTC,"Totally fine. Your record, your choice. Why would you think the value rose to double its original price in just a couple weeks? That's what I have an issue with. And call it being nasty, but I've watched the exact same thing happen every year with RSD, which used to mean you were supporting the record stores, not your own bank account. People will buy 6 of the same record (supply) and now there's 5 people who wanted that record who won't get it (demand). It's a smart way to make money, but fuck the people that do that. They're just making the entire vinyl culture less appealing to a bunch of people who don't have 300 bucks to drop on a record.  And honestly, if you want to flip records, that's totally fine but do it on eBay. This is a community of vinyl collectors, not vinyl flippers.   And one other thing, you could have this priced at 140 and people would still whine about the price being too high. Half the comments of the entire sub is ""I can get ____ for ____ cheaper at _____"" so I'd get used to it."
VinylCollectors,3dw87v,Squirtle07,-3,Tue Jul 21 01:41:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah so it's only fitting to get twice what you paid for it, does seem like flipping a rare record for profit at all"
VinylCollectors,3dw87v,Maxxtheband,2,Mon Jul 20 02:19:36 2015 UTC,"well I never said I wasn't doing that...I just happened to get this and realize I needed the money more than this record set, there's no crime in a supply v demand economy.  this really isn't any different than anyone selling any album here trying to make a buck as far as I can tell.  not sure where the hostility is from, if you aren't interested then this isn't for you, I also said I'm open to offers as well.  cheers buddy"
VinylCollectors,3dw87v,offthewall_77,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:38:00 2015 UTC,"Alright you seem genuine, I guess the hostility came from this album being a favorite of mine and it being ridiculously pricy no matter where I get it. My bad, cheers mate and sorry for the hostility :/"
VinylCollectors,3dw87v,Maxxtheband,0,Mon Jul 20 02:57:01 2015 UTC,"They just did a repress. It's still fairly overpriced because they put it on 5 10"" records with bonus tracks (a total rip off in my opinion)- but it's the cheapest you will probably ever find it- $55. It's the same thing the OP is selling but without the test presses. The term test pressing has been used very loosely with this release anyway. what pressing plant needs 100 test pressings? The band pressed the same music on generic blank vinyl, call it a test pressing, and then they doubled the price.   http://doghouserecords.limitedrun.com/products/539191-say-anything-is-a-real-boy-10th-anniversary-box-set-package-5"

VinylCollectors,3dtohg,charlatte_,2,Sun Jul 19 10:26:32 2015 UTC,Your best bet for Save Rock and Roll and AB/AP is something like Amazon. They're still selling them. Infinity on High goes for like $80+ and TTTYG and FUTCT go for $200+ pretty commonly if you have the dough.
VinylCollectors,3dtohg,Teknofiliak,2,Sun Jul 19 12:35:36 2015 UTC,I have the most recent represses of FUTCT and IOH and they dont really sound that great unfortunately. I bought IOH right when it was repressed but i wouldnt pay anywhere over $40 for either of those guys. Maybe wait it out?
VinylCollectors,3dtohg,Jerry322,2,Sun Jul 19 18:21:51 2015 UTC,I have been looking for FOB vinyl as well and unfortunately you are going to have to spend a lot of money. There are tons on eBay and discogs but TTYG is going to cost you at least $150 it looks like. It is really depressing. I am hoping they will repress it eventually.
VinylCollectors,3dtohg,TheVinylCountdownRK,-5,Sun Jul 19 18:59:10 2015 UTC,Nobody here's going to have fall out boy vinyl. We aren't 13. Check discogs and amazon.

VinylCollectors,3dtohg,NM05,-3,Sun Jul 19 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd imagine there's plenty of teenage girls with crosleys that have fall out boy records because they're ""cool and vintage"""
VinylCollectors,3dtohg,dftba171,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:28:29 2015 UTC,"And they're ruining them instead of giving them the proper care they deserve. Regardless, most of those girls can be easily educated and they won't be stubborn about it. I've talked to people in Urban Outfitters that were told five minutes before by someone that works there that a Crosley is the way to go and that they themselves have one, and I tell them that they're being unknowingly scammed.  Doesn't mean that I can't love FOB because I'm older than 13."

I offered him $60 for both but he thinks he's gonna get what he wants for them. Maybe I'll ask again in a few months. I can't imagine there are that many people out there who want it.
VinylCollectors,3dqg0m,JakeStallion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:49:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, I already picked up Cold Hard Want and The End Is Not The End from their website, so I've been trying to pick up Suburba to complete the collection but the only times I've been able to find it, the price is ridiculous. Especially since I don't like it as much as the other 2 albums."
VinylCollectors,3dqg0m,jjwood84,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:28:17 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat as you. I'm hoping now that they released TEINTE on vinyl they'll do a repressing of Suburba.   Come join us at /r/houseofheroes! Maybe someone over there has one they're willing to part with.

VinylCollectors,3djlrm,punkbandit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, if I knew I would at least get things I liked I'd probably be more inclined to do it."
VinylCollectors,3djlrm,punkbandit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:22:00 2015 UTC,"Would making it $8 any better? I know it's not much, but that's basically $1/record plus shipping. I'm willing to fluctuate a bit on pricing.  edit: or 5/$10?"
VinylCollectors,3djlrm,clapyrhands,2,Thu Jul 16 20:25:37 2015 UTC,I'm down pending list
VinylCollectors,3djlrm,dftba171,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:59:21 2015 UTC,List is up.
VinylCollectors,3djlrm,clapyrhands,2,Fri Jul 17 17:04:40 2015 UTC,"I'd probably do it, pending an artist list."
VinylCollectors,3djlrm,dftba171,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:44:37 2015 UTC,List is up.
VinylCollectors,3djlrm,punkbandit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:04:49 2015 UTC,"5 for 10, including shipping is totally fair. List would be rad too. I might be in."
VinylCollectors,3djlrm,dftba171,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:10:56 2015 UTC,"Also, I've done quite a few 5 for 25 grab bags, all newer records. Probably sold almost 12 of those. However, value is well over 25 dollar. Good luck man."

VinylCollectors,3dieiu,swampsounds,2,Thu Jul 16 14:58:42 2015 UTC,There are also a bunch on ebay at normal prices (34.99 is the retail price from most record stores that i've seen)
VinylCollectors,3dieiu,DrZissou,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:21:38 2015 UTC,Thanks!
VinylCollectors,3dieiu,ledzeppelin341,2,Thu Jul 16 22:09:19 2015 UTC,Best place to go and cop a copy is on fatbeats. They have it. http://www.fatbeats.com/products/tame-impala-currents-2xlp
VinylCollectors,3dieiu,jackthomas311,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:01:44 2015 UTC,I bought a copy on discogs this morning for $35. There's still a few up there. I'd get them fast before the flippers catch on.
VinylCollectors,3dieiu,jackthomas311,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:07:59 2015 UTC,Thanks man. I didnt even check Discogs because i figured it would be flippercity by now.
VinylCollectors,3dip59,ParanoidAndroidMan,3,Thu Jul 16 16:17:22 2015 UTC,"Looks like interpunk has some copies with the bonus 7""?   And here's a merchbar listing that isn't backordered.  I bought my copy from a redditor recently, it's a great album. Although I found the bonus 7"" tracks a little underwhelming."
VinylCollectors,3dip59,Flame_US3r,2,Thu Jul 16 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"yeah I almost ordered from interpunk but the status said it was ""almost available"" so I got sketched out. thanks for that merchbar link though! I've been literally searching all over so that's really helpful   edit: merchbar says they are sold out."
VinylCollectors,3dip59,Flame_US3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:01 2015 UTC,"Ah, I guess that's why I'm seeing such a price hike. Sorry!   Good luck."

VinylCollectors,3dkmqx,Perkele-Karhu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:06:33 2015 UTC,My local record store has that Citizen Dick record still left over from RSD.
VinylCollectors,3dkmqx,astrovinyl,0,Mon Jul 20 03:09:37 2015 UTC,Congratulations!
VinylCollectors,3dkmqx,offthewall_77,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:45 2015 UTC,That's my nice way of saying that $30 is pricey for something that can still be found for $15.
VinylCollectors,3dkmqx,astrovinyl,0,Mon Jul 20 21:21:10 2015 UTC,The nicer way would be to not comment and just walk to your local record store. Problem solved!

VinylCollectors,3diy6m,sloaches,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:24:28 2015 UTC,selling Under a Blood Red Sky in my thread if you are interested:  https://www.reddit.com/r/VinylCollectors/comments/3deb30/for_sale_cheap_records_i_need_to_get_rid_of_some/  Record is a real clean VG+!
VinylCollectors,3diy6m,sohcea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:39:08 2015 UTC,I have Under A Blood Red Sky and October if you're interested.
VinylCollectors,3diy6m,ratboydave,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:11:12 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone, thanks for the offers, but I found someone selling Boy, October, Under a Blood Red Sky, and the Unforgettable Fire for cheap. So in the interest of shipping costs I went with them. Unfortunately, I'm only looking for albums, not singles."
VinylCollectors,3diy6m,astrovinyl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:39:55 2015 UTC,Check your collection. The band may have put them there without your knowledge.
VinylCollectors,3dj8tl,xsymbianx,5,Thu Jul 16 18:39:42 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but what's ""garbage"" about the reissue?"
VinylCollectors,3dj8tl,weirdmountain,0,Thu Jul 16 19:16:31 2015 UTC,"I have this one, but it'd be difficult to part with. Are you looking to trade anything?"
VinylCollectors,3dj8tl,2112xanadu,0,Thu Jul 16 18:41:16 2015 UTC,"Im not a huge collector, and only really buy what I listen to; so in short, no. I wish I had some rare thing I could trade for it. Thank you for reaching out. If you are willing to sell it, let me know your price."
