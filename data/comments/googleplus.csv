It will set up a Google Photos Backup folder on your local hard drive (though you can browse to set it up wherever you want).  Then use ""Add..."" from the settings of that app to point to the local drive / folder where your pics and vids are stored.  Then, those pics will be uploaded to Google Photos in high quality or original (with an option for RAW).  Any other existing photos would have to be pasted / saved to the backup folder or wherever you pointed, in order to show up in Google Photos.  However, I believe this will duplicate local storage used for those pics if you have also created and synced a Google Photos folder in Drive.    The same is true of non-local / cloud-only photos, which would have to be downloaded to the default or pointed to backup location first (then the app would auto upload them to GP).  Also note that since this is a syncing app, it will save local copies of pics and vids that you save directly to the cloud via GP.  The whole process may require deletion, but I'm not sure.  If you have the local storage space, then just backup / copy / upload and delete after the fact."

Go to Google Drive, Settings, and make sure the box is checked for the ""Create a Google Photos Folder"" Install Google Drive application on your PC (https://www.google.com/drive/download/) Make sure Drive is syncing all of your folders down to its file location locally on your drive (or pick only the Google Photos). It will download a shitload of data (all of your photos, or all of your other stuff too if you picked All Folders to sync). When it's done, go to the Google Drive folder locally on your PC in Windows Explorer, and go into your Google Photos folder. Click in the upper right search box of that window, you should see the Search Tools ribbon appear at the top of the window. You can use advanced search criteria there, like ""size:>1MB"", or ""width:>1980 height:>1080"", etc. You'll have to pick the criteria that suits the photos you want to remove.   Deleting pictures in this folder will not only delete them on Drive but also on Photos. There is no Resolution criterion unfortunately."

So, 21k views has to be from bots who ""know"" as soon as a profile is set up and they keep crawling after that.

That service has Categories already, having both makes very little sense for someone NOT involved in Communities. For those that participate in Communities they are more likely to simply follow the community itself rather than individuals.

The public profile continues to be the most powerful actor on the network, and communities serve as kinda like a fishing pool.

That said the compression is very good and the results are very high quality, and for the vast majority of people not only will it be imperceptible, but technically it won't matter ether.

googleplus,34q859,whizzer0,4,Sun May 3 19:47:26 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. You know, over the last couple of months I've come to strongly suspect that there's something fundamentally wrong at Google in the way products are designed. Everybody's trying to show off with their brilliant little pet idea without anybody thinking about how people actually use that stuff.  Like how muting works on Android since Lollipop. First day morning my alarm didn't go off since there's no way to know that alarms are muted as well when you set notifications to 'none'. Why would anybody in this world want to mute ALARMS on their phones? Then, after I learned that I need to use 'priority' instead of 'none' it woke me up a couple of times because I accidentally switched it to 1 hour before going to bed and since it remembers the last setting it took me two nights to figure out what was going on.  I often wonder who these people are. Do they actually use their own products? YouTube seems to constantly forget my settings. I have a perfectly fine subscription page. I go there whenever I have time to watch YouTube videos. But for some reasons someone at Google decided it was a good idea to notify me about new YouTube uploads. I see those notifications mostly when I check Gmail at work or when I visit the subscription page when I'm at home. So what's the point? Either I can't watch the videos or I see the uploads anyway. Those notifications are utterly useless. So I turned them off. Only to have YouTube notify me anyway. And turn on CCs for some inexplicable reason as well, even though I've turned it off because I've got two functioning ears. This is where it starts to get annoying.  Why are all people I happen to follow on Google+ automatically contacts in Android? Whose brilliant idea was that? I didn't ask for that. And just because you can do that doesn't mean that it's automatically helpful to users. There's a certain ""I know better than you"" attitude at Google that gets more and more annoying.  And I know that we're not the customers, I know that the advertisers are the customers, but still Google needs to understand that without users it has no product to sell to its customers, and that there is a breaking point. Don't constantly bombard us with useless features just because you can, don't constantly redesign perfectly fine UIs.  I don't know what to make of Google services any more. There's so much brilliance on the technical side that is destroyed by brain dead design decisions. It's like a hyperactive, autistic puppy. Most of the time you are busy stopping it from peeing on the carpet and attacking the neighbor's kids. ""No, Google! No, Google! Don't do that, Google!"" But then it does something amazing like juggling five oranges while riding on a unicycle and you're like ... whoa, dude. But you know deep down that however amazing that is it probably won't make your life any easier.  Ok, that rant got a whole lot longer than I wanted to, so I'll just stop now."

This is probably one reason they are switching over to Drive for storage and organization. That, and it is way easier to get pictures out of Drive...

googleplus,31mwpe,rankun,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:06:24 2015 UTC,Had the exact same problem and I send over a million a tear in business to Google apps.  This is a frustrating glitch that they don't seem willing to look at.
googleplus,31mwpe,O2Si,2,Mon Apr 6 23:04:39 2015 UTC,"This is a frustrating glitch    You know it's not a glitch, right? It's done on purpose."

googleplus,31lh89,luke_in_the_sky,5,Mon Apr 6 04:42:52 2015 UTC,"I know this is a Google sub, and Google+ in particular, so this may not be a popular opinion, but I'll say it anyway.  The asynchronous nature of Google photos has always bugged me. Honestly, I gave up on even trying to organize it, and have just gone to a Dropbox subscription. It's made my life easier, and I haven't had to try to figure out any tricks to make it work. Change folders? Reflected everywhere. Edit a photo? Reflected everywhere. Delete a photo? Deleted everywhere.   I love me some Google. I really, really do. But despite my fanboyism, I've just had to accept the fact that there are some problems that Google just isn't able to solve for me."
googleplus,31lh89,tentonbricks,2,Mon Apr 6 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"I agree cloud services are good solutions, but my pics are in an external HDD. To transfer it to Dropbox I have to copy everything to my desktop and sync it."
googleplus,31lh89,MyPendrive,2,Mon Apr 6 15:15:41 2015 UTC,"After trying everything you mentioned, I just spent a week organizing every picture in folders - subfolders on my desktop (yes, like we did ten years ago).. and uploaded the whole thing to Google Drive (paid).   Now, each time I have pictures for something, I spend a bit putting them on a new folder and manually upload it to Google Drive.   The only downside is for generic folders (for instance ""various 2015""). I have the master copy on my desktop and erase / re-upload every few months on Google Drive.   I still haven't found any better way than this one to manage my pics."
googleplus,31lh89,spyd4r,1 point,Mon Apr 6 08:01:08 2015 UTC,"The same with me. I still organize my pics in folders because each service likes to organize it differently. Every time I try to use a new service it will find a new way to organize my pics.  I think the best solution is doing everything manually.   I really hope that the new Google Drive integration will solve some of these problems, but the way they are doing it looks like we still will have problems for a long time."
googleplus,31lh89,spyd4r,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:15:11 2015 UTC,their organization is Year / Month... with no options to change it's structure.
googleplus,31lh89,tonker,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:52:32 2015 UTC,"I use dated folders (Year / Month / date) on my PC from Lightroom's management.. but on google+ they want albums (which are usually a title over date), but yet when it sync's to drive it's (Year / Month)..   the 2000 photo limit is a pain in the ass when you want to use named albums.. for instance i'm trying to make an album just of my kids for storage for my wife and I... but i'm now on the 3rd album..  I'm not sure how to take folder management at this point."
googleplus,31lh89,spyd4r,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:51:57 2015 UTC,They're in the process of moving their photos integration into Google Drive instead. Should be loads easier to manage all your photos then.   http://www.androidcentral.com/google-brings-your-photos-and-files-together-adding-google-photos-google-drive
googleplus,31lh89,spyd4r,3,Mon Apr 6 05:50:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I commented about it, but you tried this? There's a lot of ""if you do something on G+, it will not reflect in Drive"" and vice-versa"
googleplus,31lh89,spyd4r,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:17:49 2015 UTC,"the response I got, was technically the photo in Drive is a copy of the Google+ photo... which is why there is not real synchronization."

googleplus,31k6hj,-tonybest,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:02:49 2015 UTC,but then why does it work for the first 5-10 minutes? Also muting and unmuting either side doesn't solve the problem. I don't think it's a volume issue.
googleplus,31k6hj,MadMax808,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:45:24 2015 UTC,"I know this is an old post, but did you ever solve this? I have the same problem. First 10-20 mins is fine, then I start hearing myself. the person I'm talking to hasn't changed their volume settings during that time. I don't get it, and it's frustrating, along with it being really hard to get through a sentence."

googleplus,31439u,thai_tong,3,Wed Apr 1 21:28:17 2015 UTC,I have a dummy account to do this.  Make fake account and friend it.  Start Hangout with dummy account  Send out the permanent link of the room to everyone else you want to come.  Done.  Rooms like that are not searchable.  Here is the info sheet from Google on it https://support.google.com/plus/answer/4646402?hl=en
googleplus,30apue,js79,3,Wed Mar 25 21:11:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think what you're requesting is possible. I believe that given a Gmail address, you can always look up the corresponding G+ profile. Test it yourself by typing in any random Gmail address that you know is in use on https://plus.google.com--you will see a profile pop up in the suggestions box.  Note that this lookup is still possible even if your email address is hidden on your profile, so privacy settings have no effect on it. You can try unchecking ""Help others discover my profile in search results"" on the Google+ settings page, but I don't think will help (that's for web crawlers, and that page specifically says ""[your] profile may be suggested to others"" even with it disabled). If it's critical to keep your G+ and that email separated, I strongly suggest you create a second email account for the profile."

It has been over a week and this did not work. I'm just about to get approval from the client to remove the toll free number until the data is updated and plan to re add it. I will follow up with my findings if this worked."
