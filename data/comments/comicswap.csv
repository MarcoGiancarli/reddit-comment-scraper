comicswap,3e50kr,AgainstClint,0,Wed Jul 22 00:27:48 2015 UTC,"While there are technically six Preacher hardcover collections, those six volumes cover the entire series including all of the one-shots, whereas the softcover volumes you have only cover issues 1-40, and the first four Preacher one-shots.  This means that anyone making this trade would end up with less issues of Preacher and incomplete set, whereas you would end up with more Preacher and a completed set.   Basically you're offering an unfair deal and it's unlikely people will respond. Try deleting this post and re-posting it as a trade for your softcover volumes 1-6 for their hardcover volumes 1-4, or at least highlight the fact you realize this and are willing to essentially cover the difference or work with them because of it."
comicswap,3e50kr,DaveSilver,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:37:15 2015 UTC,"These are actually the softcover versions of the hardcover ones (http://www.amazon.com/Preacher-Book-One-Garth-Ennis/dp/1401240453/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437533606&sr=8-1&keywords=preacher).  So, it's literally just a 1 to 1 trade from softcover to hardcover. It's still sort of a long shot, but figured maybe someone got the hardcover ones, didn't like it as much as they figured and would be fine with owning the softcovers + some extra cash.  I'll edit my post to reflect this though, thanks for the heads up!"
comicswap,3e50kr,DaveSilver,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:54:43 2015 UTC,I didn't even realize they made soft-covers like that. Anyway good luck with the trade.

I wasn't aware that some of these are rising in value.  I am not interested in reselling them at all. I'm a comic booka rtist/inker myself, so I am mostly looking for ""reading"" copies....tattered corners, small tears, nicks and dings are fine by me.  I'll be reading them and studying the artwork in them, not reselling."
comicswap,3dvvsq,Itsquacktastic,3,Mon Jul 20 00:46:04 2015 UTC,"I'm reheheheally not sure why you're getting downvoted for this. It's a good way to learn, for sure. A lot of classic artists in those volumes, and it's true - I see these volumes for around $5 -7 when I see them for sale. But, in some cases, this is the only way older things get reprinted, so yeah, they can get pricey depending on how many times the contents inside have been printed. Either way, love seeing budding artists, so keep it up and best of luck finding some inspirational material!"
comicswap,3dvvsq,frankgogol,3,Mon Jul 20 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I didn't mean to offend anyone at all by looking for reading copies of these at that price.  I've been an artist/inker in comics since 1990 and am ALWAYS learning and in my opinion, these essential books are some of the best places to find classic artwork in a nice clean format to learn from."
comicswap,3dvvsq,Itsquacktastic,3,Mon Jul 20 03:00:39 2015 UTC,"Best of luck - but I think that you'll have trouble finding many of these at that deep a discount, even here. With a cover price of $20, you're looking for more than 75% off."

comicswap,3dv8s6,AgentUmlaut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:51:11 2015 UTC,But look at how much easier it will be to go back and read them now that most of them are in tpb form. :D I might end up doing that for newer releases. Following by floppies is a pain unless I really want to support the book.
comicswap,3dv8s6,Rawldis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"I noticed you had the part of Marvel Now Thunderbolts when the series stopped being a load of shit and got more readable. That's what was such a pain with that series, you pretty much have to trudge through garbage to get to the story getting way more enjoyable."
comicswap,3dv8s6,Rawldis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:33 2015 UTC,I just skipped to when Soule was writing. I never read the rest of it or the garbage that came after. Same thing for Red Lanterns.   I tend to follow the creators I like instead of the characters. Usually gets me to like new characters I probably wouldn't have cared about. Another example from Charles Soule is Inhumans. I didn't give two shits outside of Medusa and Black Bolt. Now? I wish that Auran and Frank McGee would get their own limited series Inhuman Detective run.
comicswap,3dv8s6,Rawldis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know at this point it's a total dead horse, but god damn Thunderbolts' start was such a letdown, probably one of the worst in recent times. I think it was a mixture of the Marvel Now hype and how the team's announcement looked totally awesome. Then we got artwork that looked like bullshit and a storyline that was as leaky as a screen door, then most people jumped ship before it got something resembling quality.   I'm with you on following creator in some regards. Hickman was the one who really got me to give two shits about Fantastic Four outside of the classic Silver Age goodness."

As I mentioned earlier, they do have some damage and I tried my best to highlight any that I saw in the photos.  I'm asking for cover plus shipping. The cover is 3.99; to ship something Media Mail is like 2.60 or something and to ship Flat Rate Envelope is 5.75 exactly. If you want both, they will both comfortably fit in 1 envelope.  Copy A  Copy B  Don't feel pressured to take them off my hands, these can go straight up on eBay if nobody wants them."

comicswap,3cywe6,jamesonnephi,0,Sun Jul 12 01:10:11 2015 UTC,I've got the entire series in first print. I'd be more interested in selling it as one lot but would be willing to sell them individually as well.

comicswap,3cywe6,Fantastika,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:14:30 2015 UTC,"Pictures would be great.  And if you want to just sell the ones I don't have that would be cool, but I kinda assumed that you'd want to sell all of them together.  But if not, I'll just take the ones I don't have."

comicswap,3cwo7w,omicbob,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:42:38 2015 UTC,I would collect floppies but I live in Germany and I have no access to them weekly and I live in a small apartment so trades and omnibi are better for me. Thanks!
comicswap,3cwo7w,omicbob,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"Question, if you don't mind.  If you do trade these, do you have a U.S. address? (You say so in your header, but figured you should clarify it.)  Shipping in the U.S. can go media rate, where as shipping an omnibus to Germany would be rather, well expensive."
comicswap,3cwo7w,omicbob,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:12:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I have an APO address that I use to trade here.

comicswap,3cqy98,JimmyZSnow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:46:20 2015 UTC,"My shop has just about all the action figure variants. We're missing the early Star Wars ones, but we've got the vast majority of the secret wars action figure variants."
comicswap,3cqy98,Bournetocutmeat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:00:38 2015 UTC,Sick! How much are they selling them for?
comicswap,3cqy98,Bournetocutmeat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:10:26 2015 UTC,"8.99 a piece, I believe."
comicswap,3cqy98,Munstered,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:13:04 2015 UTC,I will keep it in mind. I think they still have a good number at Midtown for cover so I might try that first.
comicswap,3cqy98,Bournetocutmeat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hijack this, but since you work at a shop, could you explain to me why some sell 1:1s at $8.99? My LCBS does this too and it's an pain. The other shop in town charges regular price, as does Midtown, so I usually go there.   I've seen the $8.99 price pretty consistently at shops that charge above cover. Does it have to do with number ordered?"
comicswap,3cqy98,Munstered,4,Fri Jul 10 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"They're not actually 1:1. You have to meet a certain requirement, which is generally ordering a certain percentage of a different random marvel issue, to get the ability to order them. After you've met that requirement, you can order as many as you want.  So, for example, if I ordered 5 issue X and the action figure variant for Y requires me to order 200% of that issue to able to order the action figure variant, I'd have to get at least 10 of Y for the action figure variant.  So, some shops will charge over cover for variants they have to go over what'd they'd normally order to help cover their extra cost to actually get the variant.  Does that make sense?"
comicswap,3cqy98,ps3Steve,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! That does make sense, although I wish the shop would sell the action figure variant for cover if you buy the title with the order threshold."
comicswap,3cqy98,ps3Steve,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:36:25 2015 UTC,I have them all $5.50 I charge (Secret Wars and Star Wars).  /u/Bournetocutmeat is right about the qualifiers. The only two that are really worth a lot is the Han Solo and Boba Fett. Obi Wan Kenobi's has started to go up in price.
comicswap,3cqy98,ps3Steve,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:54:18 2015 UTC,So how many issues would that be all together?

comicswap,3cde80,AgentUmlaut,3,Tue Jul 7 02:11:39 2015 UTC,I'll be honest - I've never seen a transaction on here close to that price. You really have to go through them to get safety on both ends. As much as I'd love to see it go to someone on this board - I doubt all but a few of us could afford it.

comicswap,3cdbou,Apple_Joel,2,Tue Jul 7 00:52:41 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, a lot of this is very overpriced, even if shipping is included. For example, All New Ultimates at 4.50 each is above cover, and no one on this sub is gonna pay more than cover for such a critically frowned upon series. The Axis 1 black and white variant goes for 25 on eBay (the land of price gouging). So I'd do more research before I post. If you're looking to make a profit, this is the wrong place unless you have something like Y the Last Man floppies or something, as most people on here barely ever sell floppies above cover price. I understand though if you had a hard time pricing because it's the hardest part in here.   Good luck though, and welcome to the almighty Comicswap!"
comicswap,3cdbou,Jowser11,-1,Tue Jul 7 04:21:59 2015 UTC,I said I'll be flexible with price. Also I saw the Axis cover go between 25 and 100 on eBay. So I just slapped my number between those. I don't mind at all working out a price that people will be comfortable paying.
comicswap,3cdbou,Jowser11,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:56:38 2015 UTC,"Obviously you can price how you'd like, but that's just my opinion on what really sells here. As you can see by my flair, I've sold a lot here and most of us have been here long enough to know what sells and what doesn't.  Like with all business, why would anyone buy something from one source when they can get it for half a price somewhere else? And it's not just the case with your one variant, it's with multiple.   This is just the way it seems to work on this subreddit, especially since we aren't buying from an actual business."
comicswap,3cdbou,Jowser11,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:05:50 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter with what does and what doesn't at this point. I'm just seeing what will work right now. Maybe one will sell while others don't. Then I'll adjust and learn. I want to leant business someday and this is a stepping stone. I will get the hang of it one day and that's all that matters to me.

comicswap,3c5p2j,raleigh747,4,Sun Jul 5 01:53:05 2015 UTC,It's like miller daredevil. Some awesome ideas were created in the run but reading it can feel a bit like work with the constant reminders of what people's powers are or what recently happend but that's all Stan Lee's  everyone's comic is someone's first comic mentality that caused it.  I'd recommend reading it.

My backlog is so jammed right now, that these would be last on my list to read because there is so much depth with the X-men in general, so I'm getting rid of them.   I do know that Claremont's X-men run is one of the most well regarded runs in comics because of how long he was working on it. 16 years I believe."

I'm just trying to get close to my money back, that's why I priced it at $100.   As much as I want to sell, I would prefer to trade the Absolutes because their prices are all over the place on eBay.

comicswap,3c50st,BIGLEX76,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:12:56 2015 UTC,"Hey man! So, you've got some good stuff mixed in with average stuff. You've got Amazing Spider-Man 361-363 which are the first 3 full appearances of Carnage. That's worth some serious money. Also, you've got a lot of the Infinity Gauntlet and Infinity War, which are both pretty popular books. Otherwise I didn't see anything that really caught my eye... but those should help make some money. Good Luck!"
comicswap,3c50st,BIGLEX76,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:35:14 2015 UTC,Hey! thanks for the reply! Do you know how much those ones would be worth? And do you think I could get at least like 3 usd+ for the average stuff each? Thank you!!!
comicswap,3c50st,BIGLEX76,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:48:56 2015 UTC,"It depends on a few  things for the hot books. 1) the grade. If they are in good condition they will be worth more than low condition. 2) look at eBay sold listings. Those give you a good price gauge. 3) when you list. Those books fluctuate in price. It's really a gamble whether you'll catch a high price or low.   For your other books, maybe. Personally, if I wanted them I'd want them all in a lot and with a bulk price. I think 3 apiece might be a little high. I'd rather go with 2 or even 1."
comicswap,3c50st,BIGLEX76,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:56:25 2015 UTC,Okay thank you so much! Hopefully I can get more than 1-2 dollars for the average ones because a lot of them originally were more than 1 dollar at original buying price when they first came out. Thank you so much for taking the time to look through them all ^
comicswap,3c50st,bored-as-usual,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:24:35 2015 UTC,Actually I missed this. The What if 31 with Wolverine and Hulk is a nice book. I'd be really interested in buying it.

comicswap,3bzumx,Jowser11,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"A lot almost as big as yours is worth around 200 on Ebay. If you put it up for that price, it'll be difficult to sell it because most people around here aren't willing to pay that much and you'll end up getting people asking you to break up that lot because they need certain issues."
comicswap,3bzumx,Jowser11,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:41:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry, confused. Difficult to sell it here or difficult to sell it on eBay?"
comicswap,3bzumx,Jowser11,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:42:57 2015 UTC,"Well probably both. You can put it up for a higher price though, just give it a shot. I haven't seen Chew on here often, so maybe someone will bite."
comicswap,3bzumx,DontSuhmebro,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:44:28 2015 UTC,"What we usually do around here is sell it for about close to an eBay price and knock off some money. For example, if it's $$250 on Ebay, sell it for around 200. Sometimes people on here just plain ol' feel like good samaritans and sell their expensive comics for cheap just to support fellow readers, but if you want to really get your bucks worth, I'd suggest doing research first."
comicswap,3bzumx,koolaiid617,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:48:49 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, between eBay and PayPal, they take 14%.  So if it sells for $250 on eBay, you're only making about $215. That's in you made them pay for shipping, if not, you're looking at around $200-205 depending in which service you use."
comicswap,3bzumx,Jowser11,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"Your Saga run is probably worth about double that as well but people on here usually discount from the market a bit. Reposting is a good idea, go through some eBay sold listing and get a grasp of about where each lot is at"
comicswap,3bzumx,Comicswapper,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"First two aren't worth much because they're later printings though, so I think it isn't exactly double. Maybe around a hundred bucks."

That's the point of exchanges like this subreddit.  But you're not going to find the multiple OOP books I have on my list on IST."
comicswap,3bwvm5,BIGLEX76,0,Fri Jul 3 00:14:34 2015 UTC,"I totally understand about your pricing for OOP books, I just mentioned it because of the books you listed that are still in print,  just in case you weren't aware of IST. You do have fair prices but you might want to reconsider some of the pricings on a few of them since it seems like no one is really paying attention to this thread."
comicswap,3bwvm5,dudzi182,7,Fri Jul 3 00:25:27 2015 UTC,"I think plenty of people here buy and trade books that are in print with prices that aren't as competitive with IST and other websites.  I'm a single person, not an internet business with warehouses in two states that's probably one of Diamond's biggest customers.  My prices also include shipping, and I'm willing to work on prices as I indicate above the list, especially if someone is buying more than one thing from me.  I've got Rat Queens Vol. 1, brand new and unread, for $9, and I'll ship it out tomorrow if someone buys it today. You want to buy Rat Queens Vol. 1 brand new on IST? Great. That's $9.79 shipped from them. You want to spend $50 with IST and get free shipping for that $5.79 book? Great. I can't compete with that, though if you want to spend $50 on my books I can probably knock a few bucks off your total. I'm just some dude. I'm not IST. You pay $99 a year for Amazon Prime or whatever it is now and want to pay $6.02 plus tax for Rat Queens Vol. 1, and have Amazon throw it into a large envelope with no protection where it'll probably arrive with some damage? Great. I'm not Amazon Prime. I can't compete with that price or a warehouse full of overworked employees and robots. I'll at least package the trade with a piece of cardboard so it doesn't get damaged on the way to you. You want to buy Rat Queens Vol. 1 for the full $9.99 or whatever MSRP is at your LCS and support them? Fantastic. I'm not your LCS, I'm probably not in your local community, I'm just a dude on the internet.  I know what books cost on Amazon and IST. I know what they go for on eBay and other websites. I'm not looking to ""fire sale"" my stuff. If I was I certainly wouldn't be asking $30 for some Batman OOP trade.  I've been buying and selling and trading on eBay and other places for a handful of years now. I have a pretty decent idea on how to price my stuff to get the result I want. If this sub is just looking for people trying to throw out their trades at $5 a pop, then so be it, this obviously isn't the alternative avenue I'm looking for and I'm not the kind of seller they are looking for. Some people want deals bordering on steals. Others are willing to pay what the market would consider a fair price or find some kind of middle ground.  I'm willing to entertain offers. I have prices up there because the rules of the subreddit demand it, so I do a quick calculation and try to run with it.

It sounds like you have some good stuff (and things I would be interested in), but if you want to get some action here you'll probably need to list what you have and price it out into sets and runs at the very least."

Moonkight (Ellis) Secret Avengers (Spencer) Avengers World Daredevil (Waid) 7-12 I think. Few other titles.   Can do photos if ya want. Just won't get to that until tomorrow evening.

comicswap,3bn66l,TheW1ldcard,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"Awesome. The issues that are not bagged and boarded are later issues from all different runs from my collection. They really haven't been moved in the last year. They are in great condition considering they have not been bagged since I bought them about a year ago. They are in stacks of about 30 comics each? I don't think I have complete runs on much, but very close on a few. They can deff knock out a good chunk of a series, especially the hard to find early issues."

comicswap,3bneok,jamesonnephi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:09:43 2015 UTC,So I know of an LCS that has all three. I posted it a while back  Problem is I don't live there anymore.  I could possible get someone to pick them up or have the store ship them but it would be a bit of a hassle and I would have to have everything up front so I could set it all up  I totally willing to try for you though :)
comicswap,3bneok,jamesonnephi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:42:22 2015 UTC,We can try that or if they were stateside I could call them up and see what they've got to say.

comicswap,3bkd0k,Legion564,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:40:51 2015 UTC,"These are character backstories written by different writers for DC. Just individual series giving some insight into the characters, some tie in to the main story and some are just character enrichment.

The Minutemen story was great, as well as Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandias (the art alone for that one), Crimson Corsair, and the Comedian.  If you love Watchmen (it was my first true graphic novel) then I think you would get enjoyment out of these.  At least I did."

comicswap,3betwl,Itsquacktastic,2,Sun Jun 28 23:47:43 2015 UTC,I think sold ebay prices are the best way to get estimates. Also since it's your dad's collection right? Maybe he has some method of being able to sell them faster.

comicswap,3betwl,Wombatapult,-1,Sun Jun 28 21:08:10 2015 UTC,EBay prices are kind of sketchy since the speculation market thrives there.  Overstreet is moderately obsolete but still decent.  mycomicshop.com has probably the best indication of the price for most generally available books.
comicswap,3betwl,bored-as-usual,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:37:51 2015 UTC,"Perfect  example of this new mutants 98. Book value has it as $100 at a 9.2, ebay has it at $200+ for raw copies so the book is worth $200+,  the book has it at $360 for a 9.8 while ebay has it constantly at $700+ so do you let it go for half the value? the speculation market is the most up to date current value If a book is worth $1000 in book but $100 on ebay then why would somebody pay $1000 and vice versa with selling, why sell a book for $360 when it's worth double that. My comic shop has a raw edge of spiderverse at $175, ebay has a graded 9.4 sold for less $100, same example would you pay $80 more or go with the ebay price."
comicswap,3betwl,WigglestonTheFourth,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"Just a bit of a heads up pertaining to your assigned grades and associated ""value"". Using the Batman #230 as an example. Even with the bag obscuring the fine details that you need to see to be able to grade a book at NM/M I can tell that book is VF/NM- at best but much more likely lower. The top right corner has a large amount of rubbing and corner wear as does the top left. I can see two color-breaking creases on the spine as well. The value associated with that book in your sheet would be for a 9.8 rather than the 8.5-9.0 a VF/NM book would be (assuming it would hit that high of a grade). In there lies why some might be wary on sending you offers or you're finding offers lacking; the values you are looking at are not for the books the photographs are showing.  I'd be interested in a good number of issues you have but I'm wary to spend the time to comb through the entire list and make an offer when the values listed and apparent grades from the obscured photos make me think an offer would go no where. I'm not talking $0.50 cent offers for your books either, mostly just a difference of perceived grade versus what I can see as a grade from the photos that would put us in two different ballparks instantly (as you know a small difference in grade alters the price considerably).  I'm not trying to take a shot at you or the work you've done to photograph/grade/assign value to the collection but more over trying to help provide a reason why you may be meeting some hurdles in moving your books."
comicswap,3betwl,WigglestonTheFourth,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:35:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't assign values to the collection my father did. He passed away 10 years ago, but hr was a huge collector and assigned these values to the comics. I have sold some and the buyers were pleased with the grading. That being said they are not all 100 percent correct, but for the most part they are close to accurate. Some other buyers were pleased and agreed with the ratings.   But if a buyer is serious about purchasing some issues I can take some better pictures for ya. I couldn't do it for every comic because there was just so many of them. I just took the picture and entered the grade into the spreadsheet. Keep in mind to that some of the protective plastics have residue from grade stickers on it. It may look like it's on the comic but it's just on the plastic.   If you are interested in any issues in particular or have any questions feel free to shoot me an email. It's the last page of the spreadsheet"
comicswap,3betwl,zencrisis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:13:23 2015 UTC,I would highly recommend sending a few books out to CGC for grading to see the differences in grades. I'm not saying your father was wrong with his assessment but those books don't have boards in them (as far as I can tell) and 10 years of sitting in a box without boards can damage comics (more than likely how they got their color-breaking creases).  I'm perfectly serious about my interest. I'll sent you a private message with a few books I'm interested in to see if we're on the same page.

comicswap,3betwl,beatkonducta,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:06:10 2015 UTC,I should have explained better. Those prices are not to be taken literally. They are just the comicbookpriceguide price to give me an idea of what each one is worth. For these comics I would likely wait until the movie comes out soon to sell them. Unless I sell it for the right price. Thats why it's a little higher.
comicswap,3betwl,bored-as-usual,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:03:31 2015 UTC,Oh. Well nevermind then. Most of those arent close to worth those prices. Thanks though.

Since I did not look at the prices, I don't know if they have them at 'retail' or not.  There is only one problem with the site. I still have no idea what price I should look at.  I guess if I make it back soon, I could look to see if there are any oops and if so, mark down the prices.

comicswap,3bergb,raleigh747,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:43:24 2015 UTC,The one of biggest indicators is probably instocktrades.  If they don't have it than its not being printed anymore.  I would be interested in what books that LCS has as well.
comicswap,3bergb,Bournetocutmeat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"When I was purchasing Omnibus online regularly this is how I went about it.  Instocktrades running out of a book is a red flag for me. If it's out of stock there I check Amazon. If Amazon has the book I'll buy it immediately if i have the money for it. As Amazon runs out of a book and cannot reorder them they'll drop the discount to almost nothing over time.  Also, I almost never buy used books from Amazon. Some people on there are straight up DREAMING with their prices. I have had better experiences buying from eBay with their purchase guarantee. Also, books on Amazon will sometimes be 'out of stock' and prices will rise above cover... but instocktrades has it in stock, for 40% off cover. People suuuuuck.  Now that I'm purchasing almost exclusively through my work I just do a quick search on diamond's site to see if they have the book in question in stock, and if they dont -- see above. Doesn't happen very often, I generally order my books when they get solicited in previews 2 months out."
comicswap,3bergb,raleigh747,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. I really had not planned on putting a lot of effort into trying to get the 'going out of print, and out of print' stuff. I don't mind tpb and hc's to read, but these omnibus's just seem way too big for me.  I was interested due to curiosity more than anything..."
comicswap,3bergb,Bournetocutmeat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I have only been there once.  It is about an hour or more for me to get to.  I only looked at the wall once.  I still need a couple of hundred more g.a. bag/board combo's and they were suppose to get more in. I might be going back this week.  My problem with something like instocktrades is that, well I can't take my computer and check to see what IST has and the lcs has.  Also, I have no idea if they raise the price on OOP's (or even if they have any.)"

I've done it before."

comicswap,3b79d7,Crash_Recovery,2,Fri Jun 26 15:35:58 2015 UTC,I'll think about it.  I own the whole series to date including some of the specials.  It'd be hard for me to break it up since I know it's worth a lot more as a whole.

I know at this point I have through Issue 41 and several others like Futures End and the Villians specials.  So let's say it's about 45 issues to date.  I mean, at this point I couldn't go lower than cover value for each issue, right?"
comicswap,3b79d7,Crash_Recovery,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:53:57 2015 UTC,Issue 1 alone goes for ~$100.  Several of the first ten or so go for $15-$25.
comicswap,3b79d7,Rollinstone12,2,Fri Jun 26 16:34:07 2015 UTC,That's bananas.  Who's paying that?
comicswap,3b79d7,Crash_Recovery,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:21:32 2015 UTC,People all over Ebay. You're set (assuming all first prints) could probably go for $350-400 in decent condition.
comicswap,3b79d7,Rollinstone12,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:48:55 2015 UTC,That's insane.  I bought them all at my LCS through my pull list so I know they're not reorders.  How would I know if they're first prints?
comicswap,3b79d7,fubar20,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:21:29 2015 UTC,"If you look at the barcode, the last digit on first prints will always be ones(00111 for first print, 00112 for second print, etc.). If it is anything other than 1, it isn't a first print.  Also, the covers of 2nd and subsequent prints tend to be a different background color (2nd prints of batman #1, for example, have a red background).  So if you #1 is 00111 in barcode, congrats, you have a first print #1!"

comicswap,3b66bg,prune_crush,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:59:46 2015 UTC,Really interested in death of wolvie foil covers complete. As far as dead pool I'm in need of anything from the early half of the current run and before. I've got the later half up to the death of deadpool.
comicswap,3b66bg,prune_crush,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:15:00 2015 UTC,"I have all four foil covers, and i think the first 10 or so issues of the current deadpool run, all in excellent condition, I also have some of the deadpool mini-series if those interest you."
comicswap,3b48nr,TheW1ldcard,3,Thu Jun 25 21:00:32 2015 UTC,"While I never lost a package, thankfully, but I have had it linger for ages on some tracking position. I almost always tell my swap partner to have patience and that if something did go wrong, I'd cover them for the items already traded.  Dealing with USPS on getting any information is a God damn joke. :\"
comicswap,3b48nr,onmedz,3,Thu Jun 25 22:32:36 2015 UTC,The worst part....the distance between us is only about a 2 hour drive. They lost a package in such a laughable amount of distance its astonishing.
comicswap,3b48nr,onmedz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:15:53 2015 UTC,-______- Amazing.
comicswap,3b48nr,TooManyComics,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:50:51 2015 UTC,"The distance doesn't have a lot to do with the shipping process, other than the relative speed of delivery.  It's not like it goes Post Office directly to the next Post Office.   Chances are it had to go through at least one Sort Facility between your respective post offices. Either the sender's post office put it in a bin that went to the wrong sort facility, or it went to the correct sort facility but they sorted it into the wrong bin and it went off to somewhere else.  If it wasn't either of those two possibilities, then it's possible the packaging was damaged and either the label was destroyed or the whole thing was torn apart. Sometimes the machines can do this, sometimes other larger packages falling on yours can do this, especially if the initial packaging was insufficient.  Failing that, it's also possible it was stolen, or it fell off a conveyor belt and is just sitting on the floor somewhere.  If you had delivery confirmation tracking on the package, the post office should at least be able to figure out the last location the package was at."
comicswap,3b48nr,hmuf999,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:33:12 2015 UTC,"Damn. That's the kind of thing that makes me afraid to swap, just thinking of everything that can go wrong with a package from Costa Rica to the USA makes me nervous."
comicswap,3b48nr,henraldo,2,Fri Jun 26 04:49:09 2015 UTC,"unfortunately media mail does not work with comics, and they may dispute claims.  Because comics contain advertisements the USPS stance is that it does not count as Media Mail.  now you can get away shipping it that way and just say they are ""books"".  But, when making a claim they can call you on fraud for shipping an item via the incorrect rate.     I used to work for USPS for three years. unfortunately they are dicks"
comicswap,3b48nr,MayorOfGonewild,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:29:06 2015 UTC,"I had a conversation with a post master about this and USPS is hanging on by a thread for a multitude of reasons.  On your case there is a very real possibility that they ""out sourced""  your shipment to a sorting facility out of state (even though it was only a 2 hour delivery) only to send it (or attempt to)  back.  Boggles the damn mind."
comicswap,3b48nr,TooManyComics,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:40:45 2015 UTC,Wow....thats astounding.
comicswap,3b48nr,TooManyComics,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:56:18 2015 UTC,"USPS is hanging on by a thread for a multitude of reasons   Mostly because Congress screwed the post office with pension funding requirements, and the amount of mail being sent is drastically decreasing, so the post office is struggling to make enough income to stay afloat.  The package was likely going to a sort facility no matter what as I imagine direct post office to post office deliveries are pretty rare. USPS has closed or relocated many sort facilities, so it's possible it could have gone out of state simply because there was no closer sort facility.  And in the end that's probably way more effective than going post office to post office, at the cost of slowing down the shipping speed."
comicswap,3b2bkf,Darthspud,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:03:10 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, would you be willing to ship to the US? If so, how much total in USD?"

comicswap,3azr9b,NecroGi,2,Wed Jun 24 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"At that price range I'd suggest going on eBay. ""Older style"" is a hard criteria. You might have to look it up, but Silver Age, Bronze Age, Moder Age, Pre-Crisis, etc would be more helpful. No way someone sends ya a golden age for this nefarious purpose.   Edit: does it have to be a comic? You could get beat up copy of Greatest Joker Stories Ever Told (80's version). It'd be on cheap, old, aged paper. More pages to choose from at a low price point."
comicswap,3azr9b,bedheaded,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"Updated, thanks a lot for the info (and thank you for your help!)  I'm looking for bronze to silver age, if I ever got my hands on a golden age comic I wouldn't destroy it.   It does have to be comic strips with an older bronze/silver age style to them. I'm going to make a custom skateboard design with the 70's styled Joker in the foreground with old comics appearing behind him. I figured I'd include that information because the people within this sub-reddit know infinitely more about comic books than I do."
