katawashoujo,3dzp4f,Carter52,11,Mon Jul 20 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"Welcome aboard. as for a guide there is flowcharts available to make sure you get where you want to be (http://meta.filesmelt.com/downloader.php?file=KatawaShoujoFlowchartv20.png)  If you want my advice though i would recommend trying to play naturally to get all the different routes. It makes the experience more natural.   As for first play through, I think everyone has a huge reaction their first time. It is a very emotional game and it is important to use the emotion to motivate instead of letting getting you down.   You get on with life by trying not to forget about this game but instead embrace it and use it as motivation for change. This subbreddit is a good place to go for help and additional content to help you with your feels.   Welcome and good luck with the rest of the game."

katawashoujo,3dzp4f,JustinKnowsBest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:05:58 2015 UTC,Yea the game could stand to gain a few additional choices. Alot of the choices that make the biggest differences are the ones that seems the most basic (basic is not the right word but I cant think of a better one)

katawashoujo,3dzp4f,BlazingSakura,2,Mon Jul 20 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"Welcome!   First thing is first, you can experience the other routes by responding differently to the various choices in Act 1.  There are plenty of flowcharts to help you out. Guides o' plenty. I would use a flowchart to get to your girl in Act 1, but I would not use one during the route. Kind of ruins the tense decision making. My first was also with Emi. It was a total sob fest haha. If you take a look at the posts here, we get so many people who have very emotional first play throughs, and then come here to seek comfort in their feels. Even I've done it.  Just keep living. There are many different life lessons that different people take away from Katawa Shoujo, so find out what that is for you and use it to help improve your life. If you want to hang with us, we have a really welcoming community here, with plenty of fanfics, fanart, and discussions to celebrate our love for these characters and their stories. Of course, I would only recommend frequenting this sub once you've made it through every route. Kind of hard to avoid spoilers here.    Best of luck!"
katawashoujo,3dzp4f,Thenalongcamespider,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:49:01 2015 UTC,"Justin pretty much covered the first bit. As for the first time I played I believe I gravitated toward shizune at first. Mainly because it bothered me that I couldn't talk directly to her, and wanted Hisao to learn how. It was pleasant ride, but it didn't strike me as hard as some of the other routes. Doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable. It was my first taste of what the game had to offer, so In a way I guess it was the hook that dragged me along until I ended up on this subreddit...years later but still.  As for getting through you life? The best thing you can do is put the energy into your actual life. Maybe pick up something you've never tried before because you can. Again Justin beat me to the point lol."

While I did not participate in the production, I was deeply moved at the spirit of dedication and the perseverance of those who were involved in this work. I have to admit that when I first heard of this project I was surprised and somewhat anxious, but my heart was filled with joy every time I could recognize via the nets how members of the team were so highly motivated and pressed on with the production, leading me to closely watch over the progress being made from the very early stages. I know how it is very difficult to maintain motivation in a project where the production timeframe becomes protracted, and thus I get deeply  affected when I imagine all the difficulties the members of the team must of have had to overcome. Again, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and profess how I was profoundly touched by your efforts. Thank you very much!   原文は兼光ダニエル真さんに翻訳して頂きました。ありがとうございます。"

katawashoujo,3dxs71,OneManArmy77,5,Mon Jul 20 12:21:00 2015 UTC,"Prompt 1        ""As you know, Japan doesn't usually celebrate Western traditions,"" Misha started as she carefully tried to capture some of the gravitas Shizune had painstakingly signed to her. ""But this year, the student council is proud to announce that Yamaku will be celebrating Halloween. We will be distributing pamphlets describing this strange Western tradition to your class representatives later today.""  Well, that was… unexpected. Can't say I really know what to expect, though, having only heard about this 'Halloween' from brief tales that could easily be made up. The only thing that sticks out in my mind is costumes, ones that can be just about anything, I think. Hanako has spent more time on a computer than I have, so maybe she knows something.  ""Hey, Hana, do you know anything about this?""  She thinks for a second before shaking her head. ""Not really… just that people wear c-costumes and give out candy."" What a strange holiday indeed.   When I look back at her, I can see a grin creeping up on her face. I imagine ideas are already racing through her mind, but I'm completely lost. Hopefully something will come to me.  Just as expected, Shizune and Misha handed out pamphlets describing this upcoming special day. At least half of it is historical, but I can't say I'm that interested. Aha!  'The most common way to celebrate Halloween in the West is to dress up in just about any costume that you may choose and going from door to door for candy by saying ""Trick or treat!"" Creativity and ingenuity is always welcomed.'  Unfortunately, I'm just as lost as before. Nothing comes to mind, at least nothing creative or fun. If he decides to participate, I can imagine Kenji dressing up as a military officer, presumably to scare off the feminists. He has definitely improved over the past few months, though.   On that note, maybe I could put together or buy a samurai costume or perhaps a Western knight. Well, if we're going for creativity and unusualness, the knight is probably better. I hope the various shops in town have something I can use. Makes me wonder what Hanako has planned, but she's remained secretive so far and I can't imagine her dropping that.  After class, Hanako and I make plans to go shopping in the city for costumes and/or supplies for Halloween with the promise that we won't reveal our costumes to each other before that day.  Unsurprisingly, there aren't many shops here, but a few are distinct enough to at least give us a chance at finding something. We enter a store that seems to have a specialization in the West. The owner greets us a with a contemplative expression.  ""What brings you two here,"" he asks, his voice sounding what can only be described as calm and business-like.  ""Oh, uh… our school is having a one-time Halloween party and we didn't really know where to start,"" I manage to stumble my words out.  He claps his hands together and grins. ""Ah, that I can help with. An assistant can come by to help your friend."" With that, he pulls me to the side as Hanako talks to the assistant.  ""So, tell me, what are you after exactly? Costumes, candy, or something else?"" Straight to the points, I see.  ""Just costumes.""  He seems to know his stuff pretty well or at least better than I do. However, before going any further, he asks for my basic physical information to help limit the search. After giving him that, he brings me to an area in the middle of an aisle packed with costumes.  ""Was there something specific you had in mind?""  ""Something Western, I guess."" Not wanting to commit to anything yet, I use a generic response.  The owner scratches his head for a bit before continuing. ""Alright…"" He begins to rummage through the racks.  ""We have the standard service professions, such as firefighter, policeman, doctor, and so on."" I think for a minute and then ask him to continue.  ""We have… a knight costume here. Ah, I see that caught your attention."" Guess my reaction was more obvious than I thought.  ""That what was I originally had in mind, but is there anything else available?""  ""There is, actually. We have a rather fetching musketeer costume here. They used to be among the most common infantry units in warfare hundreds of years ago, but technology has obviously improved since then.""  Very colorful pants, chestpiece, feathered cap, rather simple leather shoes. Large amount of accessories across the chest. It's certainly a lot creative than what I had in mind. Price could be problem, though.  ""How much for it?""  The owner looks the costume over for a few seconds, wobbling his head from side to side while doing so. ""For you… ¥5000.""  ""Deal,"" I say excitedly. It's hard to believe he's letting it go for so little. Maybe this store doesn't get a lot of business? Actually, it almost reminds me of the antique store in a way.  He takes the musketeer costume off of the rack and brings it to the counter, where I can see Hanako waiting outside with a bag. We complete the transaction, thank him, and head out the door to meet my girlfriend.  I quickly look in my bag and noticed he slipped in a bag of candy for free as well. Wouldn't surprise me if Hanako received one as well. I speak up to break the silence, but not because it's awkward.  ""Find everything you wanted."" She nods her head. ""Alright, let's head back.""  The next few weeks are relatively hectic as everyone attempts to set up a party that they know very little about. And just as we promised, Hanako and I don't tell each other about our costumes. Halloween, however, manages to sneak up on us.  The party is set to start at 6PM, but it doesn't hurt to get ready early. An hour might be too much, but who knows if I need to make any adjustments to this? As soon as I start to get ready, a call causes my phone to ring. The number is a dead give-away that it's Hanako.   ""H-Hisao? Could you come to my room soon? There's s-something I wanted to show you…""  ""Sure thing. See you soon."" And with that I hang up, put my costume in a bag, and carry it over to the girls' dormitory.  I give a distinct knock on Hanako's door to let her know it's me.   ""C-C-Come in…,"" she stammers out.""  As I open the door, I see… well, nothing out of the ordinary. Hanako's room is the same as it's been the past few months since she decided to decorate. Even in the middle of her room, there's still no sign of my girlfriend. Suddenly, the door closes behind me and a pair of arms pull me into a hug from behind. I look down and notice a pair of fluffy cuffs around her wrists.  ""N-Nyah~,"" Hanako does her best impression of a cat and gently purrs.   When she lets go, I turn around only to be met with Hanako wearing a neko costume. I can't help but appreciate the sight. A very liberal black dress, complete with the same fluff that her cuffs are made from, a choker with a bell, and black cat ears. Additionally, she's wearing a massive blush across her face. It's times like these that I'm glad I picked up a bit of exercise, even if it's only to keep myself going whenever Hanako has a surprise.  Hanako then looks at me expectantly, purring the entire time. Doing the first thing that comes to mind, I pat her head while smiling like an idiot.  I speak up with absolutely certainty, ""You look great, Hanako.""  She frowns and shakes her head. ""Nyah~, I'm Haneko, H-Hisao."" I thought my grin couldn't get any wider, but I was wrong.  Once again, she throws her arms around me, nuzzling her head up against my chest and scar. Her purring grows louder. ""Haneko loves you, Hisao,"" she attempts to seductively yet lovingly say (and does a pretty good job).  I hold her close to me, just listening to her purring and running my hand through her amethyst hair. ""Do you want to see me in my costume?""  ""S-Sorry, I almost forgot…,"" her voice returning to normal.  I quickly assure her it's that it's okay. ""I'll only be a minute, but… I need somewhere to change.""  She quickly jumps onto her bed, covering her eyes with her hands. The scene can really only be described as adorable. Within a few minutes, I manage to get everything on and make sure it looks as good as it's going to.  ""Okay, I'm all set,"" I say, satisfied with how I look.   She pulls back her hands and her smile says everything. ""It's a purrfect f-fit for you."" And with that, Hanako starts having a giggling fit. She's really committed to her costume, huh?   I join her on the bed continue to pet her head. Once again, she buries herself in my chest, nuzzling her head against it.  Despite wanting to stay like this forever, I know the party's about to start. ""Should we head to the party now?""  ""Oh, I guess, but… my s-scars…,"" she stammers out her concern, one that I hadn't thought of.  An idea suddenly comes to mind and I let her know, ""What if you wear your stockings too?"" Her expression grows much brighter and she nods with excitement. They're not a perfect match, but they work well enough.  ""Ready,"" I ask with anticipation for the events of the night.  Hanako, or should I say Haneko, lets out another cute 'Nyah~' to voice her approval.  Tonight's going to be an interesting and fun night…"
katawashoujo,3dxs71,TheDwarfLard,2,Mon Jul 20 13:45:07 2015 UTC,"Continuation of my story from last week        The events of the day keep racing through my head as if they're drag racers or cougars… or drag racing cougars. All this time I thought this Hanako was after Hisao's blood to gain a significant advantage over the resistance. But that simply can't be the case anymore. Feminists aren't capable of love and they're definitely not patient creatures. If she was going to kill Hisao, she would have done so a long time ago. Even more convincingly, sex brought them together instead of tearing them apart while also draining Hisao. No, this meeting can't wait until tomorrow.  Leaving the safety of my bunker, I put my ear up to his door again. Good. They're still talking and I can hear the occasionally clack. Despite the urgency, I decide to at least give them a warning of my grand arrival.  ""Hisao, man, are you in there?""  The voice is muffled, but still clear enough, ""Kenji? We're in the middle of something important right now.""  I can't help but grow angry, ""This is more important, damnit!"" My attempts to open the door are of no use. It opens a few second later, revealing a very casual and vulnerable Hisao and his girlfriend sitting on his bed, both with fairly messy hair. At least I think so.  ""What do you want?"" He seems aggravated.  ""I'll get straight to the point: Hanako's not a feminist and I can prove it.""  Hisao just looks at me blankly. ""I've known that all this time. She's only shown love and kindness to me and I've done my best to return that."" A pause. ""Anyway, didn't I tell you that earlier?""  I adjust my glasses in what I assume is a matter-of-fact way. ""Well, you never actually proved it. You're going to want to sit down for this. It might take a while and I don't want you getting tired, man.""  After a brief recount of what happened, I finally get to the important part. ""So anyway, I broke into Hanako's room--""  Hisao quickly and angrily interjects, ""You what‽""  And his girlfriend moves to gather more information about my mission. ""Did you take anything…?""  ""No, I looked through some documents, but everything is where it was.""  ""That's a relief… but wh-what documents? You don't mean my d-diary, do you?"" Her voice is filled with relief, but only momentarily.  ""Yes.""  Sitting at Hisao's desk, I can them both of them well enough, especially Hanako throwing the covers over herself to hide. Hisao responds by putting an arm around her and slowly moves it up and down her own arm. Who knew diaries were so special to them?   I forge ahead. ""I had to know. Who's to say you weren't under some feminist spell and just saying that she was trustworthy? I had to find out for myself. And I'm convinced now.""  Hisao shakes his head. ""Well, I guess that's something at least.""  Guess it took less time than I expected, probably for the better. ""So, can I expect to see my newest recruit in action next week?""  She shakes her head from underneath the covers. Hisao whispers something to her and she slowly pulls them away. I stick out a hand to confirm this agreement. Hanako slowly meets me and a decent handshake is all it takes. At this distance, I'm able to get a pretty good view of her. Damn, I gotta admit that Hisao is one lucky guy and that he wasn't lying way back then. She's pretty cute. I'll have to tell him at another time, as the nightly assault is going to begin soon.  ""I hope you two are prepared for the attacks tonight. Get some rest if you can."" And with that, I return to the safety of my bunker.    Hanako looks at me with wide eyes and I do my best to explain the situation. ""Kenji's… a little out there sometimes. He means well. Also, you don't really have to do anything his fight against the feminists, just make something up if he ever asks.""  She nods. ""O-Okay.""  With that settled and our game of chess already completed, there's suddenly much less to do. I can't help but let out a yawn. Lying on my bed, I invite Hanako to join me for the night. She quickly and excitedly takes her place beside me and wears her cute, shy smile.  ""Need something, Ha--"" My words are cut off as her lips meet mine and we're both lost in a kiss.  ""Sleep well, Hi--"" I repeat her action and cut her off with another kiss. It's a shorter one, but no less passionate. When we break off, Hanako puts on a pout. They never fail to get to me…  I decide to quickly make vague plans to satisfy her (and myself as well). ""How about we can do whatever you want tomorrow? After all, it'll be Sunday."" An excited nod is the response I get, but it's all I need.  And just like most nights, we fall asleep together, with myself holding Hanako close.        And something really short for Prompt 2        I really wish Hisao wouldn't have asked me to do this. Surely he understands how important my time is, since I'm the one heading the anti-feminist war effort. He already knows how bad I feel about rummaging through Hanako's diary, but it was a necessary evil! You simply don't trust the word of one person, especially when a potential feminist is involved. Still, can't say I'm disappointed with the outcome of that situation. Got another soldier, after all.  He said she'd probably be in the library now. Can't remember why. Maybe reading up on strategies. A knowledgeable soldier is a strong one. Though, I still need to remain hidden from one of the enemy commanders who spends a lot of time in the library as well. Knowing your enemy is important too, and I know she's generally distracted by something.  Sticking to the shadows, I safely make it to the library. Hisao never told me where Hanako would be in here, though. He's a great second in-command, but really needs to work on some things like this. I'm sure he'll appreciate a brief lesson later.  Using my trusty binoculars, I survey the surrounding area. Nothing, nothing, nothing, noth-- something! Same purple hair, so it must be Hanako. Best makes this quick, as I'm incredibly vulnerable.   I can hear her humming loudly, giving me the opportunity to hide behind the tables. Too far for what people call 'eyesight,' but more than close enough for my binoculars. Within hearing range too.  She begins typing something into the computer, but I can't see what exactly. Before long, a new webpage appears, yet her body is in the way. … I didn't think this through, but it's too late to move. However, I can barely make out pictures of books. Must be stocking up on even more information, but her method of doing so is dangerous. Feminists tap the computers' search histories to get their own intel.  I imagine she's looking at review right now, have to know if these things work after all! The girl shakes her head and says, ""Why would someone do that…?""  There's another one that she considers, but decides against further interest. A few more follow, but are met with similar conclusions. Hey, at least she's being smart about it. You don't want faulty information.  She then pauses one another book for a while. Doing my best to see the situation, I notice her expression go from one of surprise, maybe horror, and the curiosity. Perhaps something less ethical, but ethics can be damned in these dark times.  After another few minutes of consideration, she lets out a sigh. ""I guess I can give it a try.""  Can't say anything else interesting happened, though. Yet, checking the time, I've spent far too much time here. I know Hisao's going to be angry, but I'll just ask him to apologize for me. Can't show too much weakness to the recruits. Anyway, I'm sure Hisao will understand. And he knows Hanako better than I do.  Retracing my steps, I quietly make my way out of the library and make my way back to HQ."

Once Yuuko ran out of books for Hanako to explore, it was only natural to take her curiosity online. After humming loudly for several minutes, Hanako was able to navigate to Google before punching in a select few key words. An observer might have been able to watch as the usually docile girl contorted her face into some weird mixture of shock, horror, and curiosity.    Hanako, despite shying away from the world around her, does actually enjoy the news. From time to time, she'd even find an old article that had once fascinated her. A love for journalism, sparked by her renewed activity in the journalism club, had only proven to reinforce this habit.  Like many articles before it, she had found an old article that had happened to surface from the congealed mess that is mass media. But unlike many before it, she had never seen it.  Perhaps she had subconsciously avoided it, or, rather, she had chosen to stay as far away from that subject as possible. But… here it had lain, out in the open for all peering eyes to see.   The library was a hush of mixed voices and mixed emotions.  A deer caught in headlights, her eyes quivered, palms became sweaty, hands contorted in a strange position, shoulders tensed up and head locked down.  She read the headline over and over, repeating the same moment in time for what seemed like well over seven years. Her mind was fixated, and the world around her seemed to simply fall apart.   Two Die in Tragic Fire  A dark room, a chair, a frail girl.  She looked down at her right hand. She grasped it with her other, the stark black-white contrast showing the two sides to her psyche.   The two sides to her story.  In her right hand, her parents. In her left, Yamaku and everything held within. Both are sacred, both are irreplaceable, and both are necessary for Hanako to… be.  She read the headline again.  Two Die in Tragic Fire  She struggled to rid herself of her tears, her sins, her fears, her past.  The library was quiet, desolate, lonely.  Such pain, sadness, depression and terror were only given five words. Five words, with no mention of those left behind. Hanako slowly grasped the monitor, lowering it face first onto the desk.   Infinite thoughts and memories coursed through her mind, but only one reached the surface.  ""W-why them… and not m-m-me?""  She curled her blackened hand into a fist, emotions bubbling up towards the surface.  This blackened hand served as a reminder.  ""Come on now, I'll fix that for you.""  The world flooded back into her, awareness coalescing, the sounds of life all crashing inwards.  “There you are, see? Now there’s light here.”  Hanako relaxed with the calming words. She slowly, carefully lifted the monitor back up and read the headline once more.  Three Die in Tragic Fire  She smiled, finally waking from the dream.   Her left hand, family. Her right hand, Yamaku. Her palms? Nothing.  ""Don't you have a great mother, Hanako?""  (If it confuses you, GOOD. And no, I won't explain it. The piece is titled 'Hanako's Nightmare' and I will let the reader decide what he/she thinks actually happened.)"
katawashoujo,3dxs71,__path,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:17:09 2015 UTC,"Prompt 2  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Hanako booted up the ol’ toaster in the Yamaku library. Once Yuuko ran out of books for Hanako to explore, it was only natural to take her curiosity online. After humming loudly for several minutes, Hanako was able to navigate to Google before punching in a select few key words. An observer might have been able to watch as the usually docile girl contorted her face into some weird mixture of shock, horror, and curiosity.  “P-p-project Katawa Shoujo,” are the words that leave her mouth. She wonders what it mean and clicks on the link. Her eyes widen, emotions running through her mind from what was on the screen. A simple sketch of her and four other girls. “L-l-lily! E-emi and Rin too. Even S-shizune. What is all this?” Hanako whispers to herself to keep herself hidden by this surprise.   Suddenly, the lights in the library go out. Hanako jumps from her seat and proceeds to make a dash towards the heavy wooden doors. Try with all her might, she cannot open the doors.   With fear getting to her, she lets out a cry, “Yuuko!! W-w-where are you?!”  Silence. That is her only reply from the still library. The long hair girl breaths become heavy with each second passing second. An anxiety attack is starting. Suddenly a familiar voice calls out to Hanako in a calm tone.   “Hanako? Where are you?” the voice calls out, follow by the clacking of a stick.  “L-lily? I’m by the…entrance. I saw something on the…computer that freaked m-me out and the lights w-went out. I’m scared L-lily,” she cries out, tears running down her cheeks.  “Oh dear, what did you see on the computer that made you scared?”  “I saw a picture of m-me, you, Emi,…Rin, and Shizune,” replying as Lilly makes her way to Hanako.  “Oh, a school photo or something?”  “N-n-no. A …drawing of us, that had “P-project K-katawa Shoujo” written a-a-above the drawing.  Lilly finds Hanako by the entrance, her eyes open to spot the crying girl. Hanako looks up to see Lilly and dashes to hug her friend for comfort.   “So you found out?” Lilly asks.  “W-w-what?”   “You weren’t supposed to find out about this, well not yet.”  “L-l-lily, s-s-stop it. You’re scaring me.”  The world begins to fade away to Hanako as she passes out from something.  “She found out. What should we do about her? … You sure about that? She won’t like it once she finds out. … Okay. I’ll meet you there.”  Hanako wakes up, her eyes blurry from the bright lights. After a few moments, her vision becomes clears, and notices she is in the Nurse’s office. Lilly is sitting on a chair nearby, reading a book. She looks up and greets her friend.   “Hello,” she says.  “W-w-what happened?”  “You had an accident and passed out.”  “I h-h-had this scary…nightmare Lily. It f-f-felt real.”  Lilly closes her book and walks towards the bed. She leans in to hug her friend and whispers into her ear, “It wasn’t a nightmare. That was real.”  The curtains open and the Nurse walks towards his patient. His usual fox like smile gone and a more serious face is on.  “So Ikezawa found out the truth? Looks like we have no choice but to tell you., or we can simply eliminate you,” laughing at the last part to show he’s joking.   “Why are y-y-you doing this?”  “Ikezawa, what you saw at the library was real. However, this world we live in, is not. This world is a virtual one.”  Hanako looks down, trying to catch her breath from what the Nurse just said. “What?”  “Hanako,” Lilly speaks to her friend. “I know this may sound crazy, but it’s true. I’m not blind, well not all the time.”  “And I’m not deaf,” a voice calls out behind the curtains. The owner of the voice walks around the curtain to show herself.  “S-shizune?!” she cries. “What you d-d-doing here?’  “I’m the Student Council President and it is my responsibility that I make sure students are doing okay at this school,” Shizune answers, her voice still throwing Hanako off guard. “I know this is a scary realization, but we are here to test something for research.”  “Why am I h-h-here?” Hanako questions, still in shock from the news.  “Oh, you don’t remember? That’s okay, we didn’t know why at first. But we simply volunteered to do this,” Lilly answers her friend’s question.  “Yes, we volunteer for this. It might be hard to remember but we chose to be part of this simulation, to see if people can look pass our disabilities and see us as normal people. The sketch you saw was just a concept that a group decided to become a reality so to speak,” Shizune informs.  “Yes, you all don’t actually look like this in the real world, but your personalities are. We had to make sure we found people with distinct personalities to make sure that we can gather enough information for research purposes. We had to make sure all of you could play out your role for a couple of weeks, so we can work out any bugs that might occur,” the Nurse continues for Shizune.  “F-f-for what?”  The Nurse walks towards his desk, fishing out a folder, and walks back to hand it to Hanako. She takes the folder and opens it to see a picture of a brown hair boy with a tuft of hair sticking up.  “This boy is coming to this school in about one week. He also volunteered; he is the main subject of this experiment. His role is that he just transferred to this school after having a heart attack. He has been through hell so to speak to properly fit the role we want him to. Your three roles, as well as the other two, are to try to make sure he pursues one of you in order for our experiment to undergo.”  “W-w-what if I refuse?” the confuse Hanako asks.  “We kill you and replace you with another Hanako candidate,” the Nurse says in a serious tone.   Hanako eyes widen, emotions going wild from the news of being killed and being use for testing for research. She continues to stare at the picture of the boy. He is pretty cute, she thinks to herself, but quickly brushes off that thought. Conflicted with emotions, the news being told to her and the thought of being killed, Hanako looks up to the Nurse.  “I’ll do it,” is all she can muster up.  The Nurse smiles in his fox like grin, “Glad to see you make the right choice, but unfortunately, we will have to wipe away your memory of what you saw today. We can’t risk you telling him this isn’t real.”  “But what about you two?”  “There is a reason why I am the Student Council President,” Shizune laughs. “I’m the one that has a bigger role to fill than the rest when this starts. Lilly as well, so we have to know what’s happening to act accordingly, or else this is a failure. The other two don’t know because they are filling out their roles well. No need to inform them…yet.”  Lilly grabs Hanako’s hand, “Don’t worry. We will all get through this in no time, after running several tests. We have to make sure the boy pursues each of us to gather the information needed.”  “A-a-and if he doesn’t.”  The Nurse flips the pages in the folder to reveal another boy wearing a scarf. “He’s our failsafe. If one you fails to get his attention, this boy here will take him to the roof and simply kill him to restart the simulation.”  “D-d-did he volunteered as well?’ Hanako asks.  The other three laugh at Hanako’s question.  “He is simply a program that we made to make sure the boy cannot make any friends with the male students,” the Nurse says. “Besides you girls, the boy and myself, everyone else is a program. I’m here to make sure everything goes well and to fix any glitches that may occur. Now that you know more than you should know, I have to give you this shot to make you forget what happened today. Girls, hold her down.”  Lilly grabs Hanako’s right arm and Shizune grabs her left. Hanako struggles and tries to break free but her legs are restrain to the bed. She screams for help but it’s pointless, as no one will hear her besides the people in the room. Tears begin to soak her shirt by the horror of what is happening.  The Nurse pulls a needle from his coat pockets and walks towards the restraint Hanako. “Sorry Ikezawa, but this is for the best and think of how you will change the world with this experiment. Please understand,” are the last words Hanako hears before the Nurse injects here with the syringe.  Hanako stops struggling and passes out a few seconds after the injection. Lilly and Shizune let go of her.   “So what now,” Lilly asks.  “Leave her here for the night, so I can keep an eye on her. Shizune continue your duty and make sure the other two are doing okay.”  “Yes sir,” Shizune salutes the Nurse before heading out.  “Lilly, you can go as well, but in the morning, I need you to come here so we can make sure Ikezawa doesn’t know anything.”  “Right. Bye sir.”  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  “Hi, I’m Hisao Nakai. Nice to meet,” the brown hair boy with the tuft of hair greets his class with a bow.  “Take your seat by the window. Shizune is the Student Council President and Class Representative. She will help you settle in this school. Any questions you have, go ask her,” the teacher says.  “Yes sir.”  Hanako eyes widen, “I seen this boy before, b-b-but where?”"

But I guess the more is actually walking away from the computer for a bit and doing something with everything you gathered. It would seem almost disrespectful not to after all that.

katawashoujo,3dw09b,NixonsRevenge,9,Mon Jul 20 00:22:49 2015 UTC,Misha. I count her as a main girl tho. She is awesome. Probably my third favorite character in KS. She was better with long hair tho imo.
katawashoujo,3dw09b,goofyomnivore,7,Mon Jul 20 00:21:02 2015 UTC,"Alright, you're my favorite."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,Shiina-Mikado,7,Mon Jul 20 03:21:50 2015 UTC,"You have no idea how stuck I am.  Can I be honest with you guys? Before I read her psuedo-route Suzu already was a canidate for favorite background character. When I first saw that opening CG my eyes were just kinda drawn to her. Something about that awesome hair color. Something about me relating to her sitting in the front row and having trouble staying awake. Something about the fact that she is one of the few characters actually looking your way in that opening CG.  Something about that burning question that grew inside me, asking ""who is this, and why am I so interested in finding out more about her?"". To put that question in perspective, the only one of the main girls who interested me in the same way was Rin. The rest of the main girls were fun reads, but they didn't really have the same air of mystery about them that drew me in. I didn't even think that highly of fanfiction before I read Suzu's route. That question was the push that encouraged me to go find best girl."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,flameleaf,4,Mon Jul 20 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"Woah I thought I was the only one. When I first opened KS and it showed the class I said to myself ""Can I date her? Does she have a route?"""
katawashoujo,3dw09b,vinovin15,6,Mon Jul 20 11:58:59 2015 UTC,Yuuko. She would be the one for me.
katawashoujo,3dw09b,Morlok8k,5,Mon Jul 20 00:26:26 2015 UTC,"Seconded, Yuuko was great. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I could deal with how badly I know it'd upset Kenji, so I'm just going to accept that I might not have enjoyed her route"
katawashoujo,3dw09b,goodnames679,5,Mon Jul 20 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"oh man, the whole kenji aspect would be crazy.  definitely an amazing route if it existed."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,Morlok8k,3,Mon Jul 20 03:16:11 2015 UTC,"Exploring that whole aspect could have been amazing and interesting, I won't deny it. Possibly could be the best written route of the game. But it would make me so extraordinarily sad to hurt Kenji like that, I don't know if I could do it."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,goodnames679,3,Mon Jul 20 03:34:12 2015 UTC,"ehh, it really depends on the storyline.  but yeah, i feel ya."

katawashoujo,3dw09b,LittleMark,11,Mon Jul 20 12:30:55 2015 UTC,"I've always liked Kenji. I know he changes from route to route, but in my favorite route (Hanako's), he at least tries to help Hisao out in some way. He's still out there nearly all the time, but at least he means well."

katawashoujo,3dw09b,TheDwarfLard,2,Mon Jul 20 00:21:33 2015 UTC,"She is actually part of KS, though."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,Reqqles,4,Mon Jul 20 01:09:43 2015 UTC,"So are Suzu and Molly, both appear in the classroom cg and Molly shows up in the background of various other cg's as well.   To say they're not part of KS is kind of silly. Their parts are simply smaller than Miki's."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,Reqqles,2,Mon Jul 20 01:20:48 2015 UTC,Well Miki actually did stuff.   Suzu and Molly didn't do anything.   It is like comparing a supporting character to an extra.
katawashoujo,3dw09b,brythain,2,Mon Jul 20 01:24:09 2015 UTC,"I acknowledge that difference, all I wanted to point out in my reply was that Suzu and Molly are definitely a part of KS, much moreso than Rika and Saki, whose existence is confirmed only in the april fool's announcements."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,Reqqles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:34:22 2015 UTC,They are unnamed in KS proper. Only Miki of the three is actually named in the game.
katawashoujo,3dw09b,brythain,3,Mon Jul 20 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"And magical as that is, that means nothing. They're still in the game."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,Reqqles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:17:45 2015 UTC,"In the sense that many unnamed background people are in the game? There is no evidence in-game for their existence under those names. It's not magical, it's logical. A player who had exhaustively played KS would know who Miki was, but would have no clue as to Suzu or Molly. It's only beyond the game that they have such identities. Hence, a qualitative difference exists."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,brythain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:21:39 2015 UTC,"Again, I am not at all saying there isn't a difference between Miki on the one hand (no pun intended) and Suzu and Molly on the other.  All I'm saying is there is still a big difference between Suzu and Molly, who did appear in KS, limited though their appearance was, and Saki and Rika who didn't appear at all. I don't know why this still needs to be argued."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,__path,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:09:34 2015 UTC,"That I agree with, and you'll note I didn't argue against it."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,__path,3,Mon Jul 20 16:31:31 2015 UTC,"Molly was only an extra because she was supposed to star in her own game called Measuring Shadows by some members by 4LS but got canned. /u/Valjean_Lafitte mentions it better in an older post   Luckily, Molly exists in KS than not at all."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,Solace1,3,Mon Jul 20 02:23:05 2015 UTC,"Also, I'd like to refrain from the fanfic characters (Suzu, Molly, Saki, and Rika) since they really aren't an actual part of KS   But Molly doesn't even have half the fans of  the other 3. She'll never get love around here.  Joking aside, I really like Meiko. She is an older Emi with more voluptuous features. Plus she is pretty funny and teases Hisao the same as Emi. Also Kenji, he's just too good not to like."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,Panory,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:47 2015 UTC,At least we have somenice art of her
katawashoujo,3dw09b,brythain,3,Mon Jul 20 07:24:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit partial to Nurse, but mostly because of his theme music. Kenji always got a chuckle out of me at least, and he really shone as Hisao's friend depending on the arc, so I'd say overall he's my favorite."
katawashoujo,3dw09b,OneManArmy77,3,Mon Jul 20 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"I love Mutou and his tragic professorial demeanour. He reminds me a lot of me. :)  It drove me to write my Mutou/Akira/Rika sequence, and then later, 'Pavane', which explores Mutou's post-divorce love life."

A more or less quiet week whereupon I was also of calm mind (except for some stupid crap I had to deal with but that remained separate).  Clean, calm mind. Good thoughts, quiet contemplations, little of the stupid 'still-thinking-of-things-past-but-not-forgotten'. It was a weird, if hot, oasis of mild clarity.  Then this shit shows up and my eyes fall right off the wagon and into the feels-pond. C'est la vie. Nice find though, good Atario."

katawashoujo,3dvhyt,Ooreally,3,Sun Jul 19 21:38:35 2015 UTC,I'd say Shizune next. Lilly is the best last IMO. For reasons I can't really reveal without spoiler stuff.
katawashoujo,3dvhyt,Dannflor,2,Sun Jul 19 23:54:18 2015 UTC,People tend to split Hanako and Lilly apart so you might want to do that. Also they say Lilly or Rin last has a better end to KS. While a lot people find Shizunes route lacking in substance. So take that into account.
katawashoujo,3dvhyt,__path,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:43:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice :D   I still have nightmares of the lemon scene ಠ_ಠ
katawashoujo,3dvhyt,Morlok8k,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:30 2015 UTC,"I'd do Rin, then Lilly or Shizune.  You could swap Lilly and Shizune if you want.  Lilly is my fav, and has a really feel-good storyline, but I felt that Shizune gave a good end to wrap everything up.  Idk, either way works.  The main thing is to not play Lilly and Hanako right after the other."
katawashoujo,3dvhyt,Laflaga,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:41:22 2015 UTC,"I did Emi, Lilly and Shizune. Just started down Rins path(starting act 2 now) with Hanako for last.  I think it's probably a good idea to not end on Shizunes path. It's not bad but I think some the others are probably going to be better.  Having completed Lillys route myself, I think it would make a nice place to finish at, so consider leaving her till last."
katawashoujo,3dvhyt,BlazingSakura,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:45:07 2015 UTC,"Just going to say, deciding what order to do the routes in is a decision you have to make with your heart. Every girl impacts people in different ways. If you feel like one of the girls is far less interesting than the others, then get her done right away. You should save a girl you feel really growing fond of for last. There is no right or wrong way to do it. It just depends on you."
katawashoujo,3dvhyt,Dafty-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:22:46 2015 UTC,"With this in mind.. I wish i had left Hanako for last...   Guess there is no harm in replaying people, right? I mean so far i have only had good endings, lets see how badly things go if shit were to hit the fan.  Thanks for the advice :)"
katawashoujo,3dvhyt,Dafty-,0,Mon Jul 20 06:01:35 2015 UTC,"Well it's as you want even as __path said about Shizune.  But personnally I would say: Next: Rin ( she is deep so you will have time to understand her now it's your 3rd story , and you will have time to forget her if you cry because of the end )  Then:  Lilly ( she is cool and calm , will be good after Rin)  Finnally: Shizune ( really cool story and if you get the good ending you will be happy to have accomplished so much for the school :) cliché but fun )"

I saw an ad -- AN AD! Of all things! An ad somewhere. Can't remember exactly where. Probably Penny Arcade? Something Awful? It's been too long in Internet Time. It was an ad with an image of Hanako, and one of the phrases that appear on the main page website.  It looked oddly out of place, in comparison with the website I was visiting, so I got curious, and down the rabbit hole I went, to join the masses of people who eagerly awaited for Act 1... And then, the final release.  I remember the day of the release. I barely slept. I finished half of Emi's route before crashing. I finished the other half when I woke up. I 100%'d the entire game in a week, work and school and all.  So, yes, I remember Lilly's original art, controversial blog posts, the loli upgrade, and Rin in a Bin.  I was there when all of it happened.  Still being here is baffling."

katawashoujo,3dtg32,Thenalongcamespider,9,Sun Jul 19 07:51:43 2015 UTC,"People who connected with Rin, seem to go through you mentioned, or something along the lines. I think all of the girls' routes reflect on the readers on different levels, positives and negatives, but the experience from the game have lasting impressions compared to other things. Depends on the person really. After playing Rin's route, I felt like on an existential trip. Did a lot of cloud gazing and picked up drawing."
katawashoujo,3dtg32,__path,2,Sun Jul 19 08:01:36 2015 UTC,"I wish I could draw, but I'd be struck by lightening the moment the pencil hit the paper lol. Though cloud gazing has always been a nice way to pass the time for me:D"
katawashoujo,3dtg32,__path,3,Sun Jul 19 08:20:56 2015 UTC,"You don't have to draw, rather do something else, like write or picked up an instrument. Even if you can't draw, doesn't hurt to doodle every now and then or practice a bit each to improve. Really up to you. Put the feels from the game to something positive.   I like cloud gazing, it helps pass time waiting for the bus and I can get lost in them for a while."

katawashoujo,3dtg32,Dafty-,4,Mon Jul 20 14:28:22 2015 UTC,"You are certainly not alone. I still remember just how hard Rin's story hit me the first time I read through it, even though that was over 2 years ago. I did her good ending first. It left me with a ""d'aww... that was nice"" feeling at the end, and I enjoyed it overall.  However...  Her neutral ending.   It destroyed me. I could not sleep that night; I could barely take my eyes away from my monitor long enough to take a breath. It took me a week, perhaps even two, to get back to normal from the experience that was Rin.  Not sure how you handle things, as everybody is different, but for me, it was not enough. I needed more, and I found this fanfic that is basically a continuation of Rin's neutral ending. It is certainly a read, but I recall it being a really good one, at that.  Welcome to the club. Rin best girl"
katawashoujo,3dtg32,MaimedPhoenix,2,Sun Jul 19 10:06:59 2015 UTC,"I think I ended up with the good ending, I mean it all seemed to work out...I think I would have died if it didn't >.<. I'll go back later probably, but hopefully prepared mental for the trauma XD. Also glad to be part of the Best club :D"
katawashoujo,3dtg32,Dafty-,3,Sun Jul 19 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"Not childish dribble, it's emotions for a character you connect with, and we all get that here. Especially after Rin's route, for me. Rin's frustration really stuck with me because I wanted to reach out and shake her and say ""I'm here! I understand you!"" It was a very difficult thing to ""move on"" after her route.   It's good to vent your thoughts to anonymous people, they can be the least judgemental and the most understanding. c: So glad you ""enjoyed"" her route and got something out of it. Rin is super special (and so are you). You can always rant here, haha."

katawashoujo,3dtg32,MaimedPhoenix,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:49:45 2015 UTC,"I never got the neutral ending. I actually never saw it.

katawashoujo,3dtgtm,Hecatonchair,5,Sun Jul 19 08:04:59 2015 UTC,"Emi isn't a primary route. Her route is locked in if you agree to work out on the Nurse choice and going for it during the second day on the track. The game works on a point system, where making choices throughout the first act adds or takes points to each girl. So introducing yourself to the class adds a point in favor of Shizune and so in each choice. But make a bad choice, you might not get any girl."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,__path,3,Sun Jul 19 08:14:10 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, her choicre is so natural its hard not cop comnsider her route a rout they wanted the player toi take.

katawashoujo,3dtgtm,__path,5,Sun Jul 19 08:17:56 2015 UTC,"Emi's route is usually a lot of peoples first route, myself included. But I think it's a good route to introduce new people who haven't played a VN before on what's in stored. I think it's one of the lighter ones in sense it's has moments that makes you laugh and seem like they are in a good relationship. Add the drama to it and it hits the feels at the right spot, depending on the reader. Not to take anything away from Emi's route, but I saw it as one of the lighter ones, where the others can be worse or amazing. Just my opinion, but Emi has a place in heart as first girl, so can't hate on that."

I think Emi and Rin are middle, and Shuzune gets the short end of the stick. Then there are people  who like side characters and characters that only appear in CG art, Suzu being the popular one of the bunch. Then there are the April Fools girls  that get love through fanfics."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,TheDwarfLard,3,Sun Jul 19 08:45:46 2015 UTC,"Depends how you think about it.  The guy's got a critical heart condition.  Pushing himself seems like a stupid thing to do, given that.  Plus, some of us just hate exercise, heh."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,Dannflor,2,Sun Jul 19 13:40:42 2015 UTC,Hisao shows quite a lot of disinterest in exercise (especially since he only player soccer/football because his friends did) and Nurse told him not to push himself.
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,bilog78,2,Sun Jul 19 14:12:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I stopped the first time I played through just because I was afraid Hisao would just die. I wasn't sure how severe the different choices would be as I'd never played through a VN before."

My first route was Hanako's, which I followed because it was the one that came naturally, much more so than any of the others (except for Rin's, in which however I found our beloved Master of Romance to be extremely dense: I felt an obvious connection with the female character, but a total disconnect with the protagonist).  Emi's route is “obviously” only if you assume that you should go with physical activity because of your heart condition, but also despite it (honestly, trying to follow Emi too closely would be more likely to kill you without adequate preparation)."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As far as the most logical route, I think it has to be Emi's. Not sure if they did that on purpose because it's a good first route but really I agree with you."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,Joby05,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:47:26 2015 UTC,"Yet, if Hisao chooses to listen to Nurse's advice, Emi's route should be soft-locked out. Nurse tells him to not push himself or overexert himself with exercise; just do light stuff to help out a bit (running with Emi is physical intensive). While he comes out physically better in the end, he does blatantly ignore a medical professional (not to say he doesn't do that in the other routes by not exercising). Couple that with Hisao's 'eh' approach to exercise/physical activity in the past."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"Aren't there several ways to get into Emi's path? I think you can chose to go easy but still get on her route if you chose to have lunch with her over Shizune/Misha or Lilly/Hanako? My memory is a bit fuzzy but I didn't think you had to ""push yourself"" in order to get her route."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,Joby05,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:43:56 2015 UTC,"Hisao has to push himself during the second run to reach Emi's route (spoilers since it's the flowchart). Whether or not there's a lot of Shizune points piled up is irrelevant, since that just leads to a choice between Shizune and Emi after pushing himself."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,__path,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:52:16 2015 UTC,"You're right... you do have to ""go for it"" and even then if you have enough Shizune points you can get off the Emi path. I guess it has been a while since I've played, lol."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,TheDwarfLard,0,Sun Jul 19 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"Emi talks to the Nurse about Hisao running. She makes the diet plan and most likely a running schedule with the Nurse so Hisao wouldn't risk another heart attack. Yeah, running is a pretty physical exercise, but it can be taken slow and gradually become physical down the road. Look at the couch to 5K, it starts of slow then goes to running for half an hour. But it has room to be taken at a slower pace or faster pace, depending on the person.   Also just because Hisao didn't like to physical activities in the past, it shouldn't detract on what the Nurse says what's best. Hisao agrees that he take his health seriously during the festival with Emi. Past 'eh ' approach to working out can change during outcomes and an eye opener when coming close to ghost."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,__path,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"But Hisao doesn't start really slowly and doesn't think of doing so. For him, it's either pretty much slow down and give up or do his best to match Emi's pace (and in his condition, that's not something he should be doing).  In some routes, spoiler In others, like Hanako's, he simply doesn't get any better or worse. It's not really out of the question for him to pick something up after any of the routes, especially if say both Hanako and Hisao decide to run a bit together.  And by the time of the festival, he's already in the mindset of x girl (Emi, in this case). His resolve to exercise is practically non-existent in other routes. However, he does sometimes have slight desires to do something, but just doesn't during whichever route."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,Dannflor,0,Sun Jul 19 17:59:09 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Hisao is a blank slate character besides reading in the hospital and a knack for science and being dim witted at things. So the reader makes choices that change Hisao into the something close to the girl, competitive for Emi, starts drawing in Rin's route and so forth.   I'm not going to bother with the different routes because it has inconsistencies because of different writers. There is a lot of that that bugs me between routes."
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,Laflaga,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:06:26 2015 UTC,"For me, when I first played through I didn't know to expect at all. I ""pussied out"" because I didn't want Hisao to die. :P"
katawashoujo,3dtgtm,Laflaga,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:59 2015 UTC,Haha! For my first ever play through I immediately liked Emi since the first time we met and everything then was me wanting to see her again.  Choosing to go running because I wanted/hoped it would give me the chance to meet her again.  Then going for it because I wanted to impress her.  I think in that situation you could easily forget everything but the 'here and now' and be fired due to a competitive situation. At least I think I would lol!

katawashoujo,3dtgtm,Joby05,2,Sun Jul 19 08:30:41 2015 UTC,"In the ""common"" route of the VN, everyone is introduced. It's basically your way to meet all of the girls and ""decide"" which one you want to pursue (though in Emi's case you can often stumble upon her without trying to). This is pretty standard in VNs so that you get to meet all of the main characters before making any substantial choices.  As far as why Shizune is best girl... she mostly isn't. LOL!  I think in the version of KS you're reading that Emi is definitely the best girl. She is tragic but so full of life. She suffered a serious loss and tries to get through it by bettering herself. She is strong and mostly independent but also funny and silly. Minus being a bit lolicon for my taste I think she is a solid choice for most people. :-D"

Rin's neutral ending is really quite heartbreaking, even more so than the bad ending in some people's opinions.

It ripped my heart out when it ended and I felt like a failure.  EDIT: To actually answer your question I'd say just play as you and don't think in terms of getting a good or bad ending just play each route and get whatever outcome you deserve. You can replay later to get different routes if you want 100%."
katawashoujo,3dpd2f,Laflaga,0,Sun Jul 19 22:54:32 2015 UTC,"My recommendation is don't shoot specifically for any certain ending, go for your ending.  Do as you would do, act as you would act, and if you reach a bad end, there's probably something you should learn from it and improve yourself.  Since you've already finished Emi, I'll use her arc as an example.  Her bad end is reached when you white knight too hard.  I forget the exact wording, but I recall that the good end is achieved when you enforce that you (Hisao) like her strong independant qualities, but ask that Emi allow you to be there for her in the same way she could be there for you.  You may even find that a supposed bad/neutral end may even be your good end.  Without spoiling anything, in my honest opinion I felt that Rin and Hisao communicated in the same way a sledge hammer communicates with a cinder block, and a relationship between Hisao (as played by Hecatonchair) just wouldn't work out.  For those who have played her arc and want to hear my elaboration on this Rin route spoilers  Long story short, play as yourself, and get the results you would achieve in the same position."

Now I still don't know if I want to play another story yet, for the first one was as depressing as it was happy, the bitter road to joy... and I probably got lucky as well to have chosen the correct path and not ended up dissapointed.   If you don't feel you're ready, then I wouldn't do another route, as it could muddy the experience. Hell, if you're completely satisfied with just one route, then that's fine too.

Hanako is a good one to start I think but you can feel more with other girl , like Rin for exemple (if you get her personnallity which is hard).  Don't say too much to don't spoil you but have fun reading other arc as well.   Still KS is one of the best thing I experienced in my life. Honnestly."

For fanfics, there's this post for recommendations that someone did that caters to each girl and others. Also  there's the KS forums, that have both fanart and fanfics, along with other discussions.   For an official sequel, 4LS have said that it won't happened, but there are other studios working on VNs that are inspired by KS.

katawashoujo,3dfkvq,suggex,63,Wed Jul 15 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"Those girls are in your actual life, you just don't have a linear novel to guide you to love with them. For instance; Hisao didn't know Hanako until he talked to her in the library, and he didn't know Lily until he stumbled into her clubroom and hung out with her for awhile. You're in the same position as Hisao, except you don't speak to Hanako in the library, and you don't stumble into the clubroom (or if you do, you quickly apologize and leave). I'm not trying to be critical, just noting that you have to grab what you want out of life's jaws, or they'll pass you by, and you'll end up on the school roof getting drunk."

katawashoujo,3dfkvq,Quof,3,Thu Jul 16 01:41:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you for the most part but the biggest difference is that since Hisao lives near and goes to school with them he can ""stumble"" upon them again and again after his first unexpected encounter. It's hard to meet these people over and over again accidentally in real life."
katawashoujo,3dfkvq,JoFlo520,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:17:25 2015 UTC,"Phones and facebook, dude. Not to mention you can easily consistently meet groups of people by consistently going to certain clubs, groups, and places."
katawashoujo,3dfkvq,Dafty-,4,Thu Jul 16 18:19:51 2015 UTC,But he didn't do any of that at all.  He didn't consistently intend to meet them.  That wasn't his motive at first.  He just stumbled upon them a lot until he realized he ended up becoming their friend.  He rarely used his phone and didn't use Facebook.  It would work way differently in real life is what I'm saying.
katawashoujo,3dfkvq,kloiberin_time,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you know asking for facebook since the first time you see the girl sound like really...creepy or stalker to me :/   So as JoFlo said , it's hard to get in ""friendship"" relation with some you get by chance once."
katawashoujo,3dfkvq,Quof,3,Thu Jul 16 19:48:52 2015 UTC,So what you're telling us is...
katawashoujo,3dfkvq,kloiberin_time,4,Thu Jul 16 14:49:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty much. I'm not an expert on love, but it should be obvious: interact with girls. If you like them, confess. If they don't like you back, move on. Too many people just ""wait"" for girls to come to them. Which is a thing that happens, but it's not wise at all. You gotta put yourself out there. Just do it. Just ask girls out. Be aware of your appearance and stuff.  What Katawa Shoujo (and other VNs) taught me more than anything else, is that someone will love you just for being yourself. You don't need to be a rock star and you don't need to be a fake cool dude. You just need to be who you are, and somebody will love you.*  *though obviously it's best to not be an asshole, shower, etc"
katawashoujo,3dfkvq,JIVEprinting,3,Thu Jul 16 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"Yep.  When I was in high school I was the ""wait and see"" type of person, and there was a girl I was absolutely head over heels in love with.  Best friend type situation.  We were inseparable but I never got the courage up to ask her out.  Nothing ever happened.  I graduate, go to college, we drift apart, leave college, start working, etc.  At our 10 year reunion I ran into her and she asked me why I never asked her out.  She felt the same way but both of us were too afraid to make the first move.  I think there were several situations like that in my youth, where not taking that leap ended up being a regret, and not just in relationships.  Jobs, scholarships, just life choices.  When I was about 24 I had a roommate that just oozed charisma, and while he ended up being kind of a dick in the long run, he taught me that confidence is the biggest aphrodisiac.  It didn't matter if I was chubby, it didn't matter that I was driving a 1994 Ford Taurus or whatever.  If I acted like myself and owned it things would happen.  Maybe I don't get to date the cheerleader, but what's the worst that can happen if you ask her out and she says no?  She says no.  That's it.  Fast forward and I'm 32.  I have a wife that I love and a home that I am proud of.  I started to take risks and many of them paid off.  Life isn't always perfect.  Breakups happen, layoffs happen, people drift apart, but I am proud of the risks I have taken, even if I fail."

katawashoujo,3dfkvq,Dafty-,9,Thu Jul 16 08:04:07 2015 UTC,"Rather than cynical, you're both projecting (there's over 3,000,000,000 women in the world and none know anything about love and respect?), and probably being unreasonable.

But I still sure that a girl like Rin doesn't exist   See, like now, you're putting the cart before the horse. Don't go out looking for ""girls like Rin"". Go out looking for people to fall in love with, whoever they may be. Don't write up a list of attributes that women must have. Don't compare them to anime women every step of the way. They are real human beans, each unique. Love them for their uniqueness. Don't love them for conforming to a character archetype from a taiwanese slideshow."

I'm really negative on everything , I have to change that but that's really hard  And yes even if I love a ""girl like rin"" I like a lot of type of girl , my ex girl friend for exemple , I trully loved her but she wasn't artistic and even physically she wasn't my type.

He would shit his pants then roll over and die if he went to Mihama Academy from Grisaia.  Yuuji is shot, stabbed, molested by men and women, watches everyone he ever cared about die, and is turned into a fucking child soldier before the game even begins.  Hell two of the paths he ends up taking a load of buckshot into his arm/back and that's the good endings.  And you wanna talk about girls with emotional problems?  Hanako would be the most normal girl there.  I won't even go into the shit the protagonists have to go through in the Zero Escape or Infinity series.  Hisao has it easy.  All he has to do is not be a dick or a white knight and he get's sex."

I mean, all the other girls dissabilities were from birth so i am assuming there isnt a lot of drama (Except for hanakos, but she doesnt really strike me as an exciting character) and if there is i wouldnt really think it would have the same ""feel,"" to it that Emi's had. Or the character is just too serious for it to be exciting, like Lilly or Shizune. I'm not sure though, thats just what i'm assuming. I will admit, i'm pretty sad Emi is the only really bubbly, fun girl that actually has a route in this game. Maybe thats one of the reasons i'm feeling like i am about the game, Emi is probably the most unique character, and ive already played through the whole story, when it ended it almost felt like ending a relationship in real life, fuck man, never thought a VIDEO GAME would make me feel this way hahaha."
katawashoujo,3dd4dj,Emi_Bro,9,Wed Jul 15 10:56:50 2015 UTC,"would i be wrong saying Emi is really the only exciting one?   Yes.  While I like Emi as a ""person"" the most, Hanako's route was my favorite story-wise because both Hisao's and Hanako's development throughout the arc is nothing short of incredible.  This is one that tripped me up, and it took some advice to reach the good ending.  And quite honestly, Emi's character is a relatively common archetype.  What makes these characters impressive is their ability to come off as real people, and make their stories carry actual weight.  Lilly's route I found the most heartfelt.  Emi's route I found the most applicable to my own life.  Hanako's route I found the most ""grand"" in terms of characters and how they change over the arc.  Rin's route I found fucking frusturating, but honestly probably the best written.  Shizune's route... okay this one I wasn't impressed with.  Probably the most realistic though.  Every route is worth playing.  Trust me, don't stop now."
katawashoujo,3dd4dj,Dannflor,2,Wed Jul 15 11:09:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the mistake, i wasn't planning on stopping. I just cant shake the feeling like Emi is the only one i will really be attached to and because of this the others will seem sort of dull, definitely want to learn everyones story though, i'm not going to stop where i am now."
katawashoujo,3dd4dj,Hecatonchair,4,Wed Jul 15 11:18:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, and if you're down for a little advice, I recommend playing Lily's route last.  For a multitude of reasons, its the most appropriate end to the game."
katawashoujo,3dd4dj,Dannflor,3,Wed Jul 15 11:47:55 2015 UTC,"I'm always up for advice, thanks a lot actually because i was considering playing Lilly's route next."

katawashoujo,3dd4dj,FollowThePact,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:05:32 2015 UTC,locks you into her route is a natural choice to make   I ended up avoiding her route my first time because I didn't want to accidentally push Hisao too far and die. :(
katawashoujo,3dd4dj,suggex,2,Wed Jul 15 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"Haha, unless you were specifically gunning for Emi the first time around, I would consider this a blessing.  The vast majority of people get Emi first, and I kinda wish they made it a bit more up to the player to decide which girl they will make their first run through with.  Call me a weeb, but most people consider their first run to be the most true to themselves, and making it so hard not to get Emi's route kind of cheapens that effect."
katawashoujo,3dd4dj,Atario,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:06:12 2015 UTC,"I guess I just didn't really know what to expect, and so I expected every choice to possibly have drastic consequences. So I just didn't push myself for fear of death. :P"

katawashoujo,3ddi1k,OneManArmy77,3,Wed Jul 15 12:32:31 2015 UTC,"Standing Tall  My curiosity is met by a soaking wet Emi and Rin, the former of whom proceeds to stare back at me. Her face contorts itself: first surprise, then anger, curiosity, happiness which finally causes her to raise the corners of her mouth into that mischievous grin she saves for lapping me on the track. The bundle of energy quickly bounds over towards my table, with Rin’s sleeves in tow.  “So, you thought you could sneak out here by yourself and lie to us about having plans, eh?” Emi snaps at me.  “No,” I pause for a second, hoping to tilt the situation in my favor, “I was just being a gentleman to go on ahead and wait for you two to show up.” Smooth.  “Then where was this ‘gentleman’ when we were getting rained on?” Rin takes a moment to sneeze, instinctively catching most of it on her wet shoulder. “See? What kind of gentleman are you to leave poor damsels out in the rain like that?” Real smooth Hisao, real smooth.  Emi gives me a quick pout before quickly sliding herself into the seat across from me. She lunges, grabbing the napkin underneath my empty coffee and uses it to wipe down her hair. Aparently satisfied with her handiwork, she turns her attention to Rin, who is parked right where Emi dragged her to and in the midst of giving one of the other patrons one of her trademarked vacant stares.   “Rin, you can sit, you know!” Emi teases. Rin slowly turns her gaze towards Emi and cocks her head to the side.  “Ok.” She plops herself down next to Emi and plops her feet up on the table, causing the silverware to clatter before settling down again. Yuuko attempts to maintain some semblance of composure, but manages to fumble the menus onto the table. It’s a miracle the porcelain has survived this long. Yuuko picks herself off the floor before shakily bowing before us.  “Hi, sorry about the mess! Can I get you anything?” Yuuko looks like a gentle breeze might undo her at this point. Emi grabs one of the menus and apparently reaffirms her choice before speaking.  “Hi Yuuko, can we get a platter of turkey sandwiches without the mayo, a slice of whatever pies or cakes you have today, a cup of tea and a glass of water for Rin?” Rin gives a sagely nod at the selection while Yuuko struggles to write it all down. It takes me a moment to realize that both Emi and Yuuko are now staring expectantly at me.  “Hisao, do you want anything else?” Yuuko manages to stammer out over the top of her notepad. Considering that I was waiting for Hanako to eat, I guess now isn’t a bad time to place my dinner order.  Red Velvet  “Uhh, I’ll have a plate of sandwiches and another cup of coffee as well, if you don’t mind.” Yuuko shakes her head vigorously, but not before sending her glasses sailing across the room.  “Oh no, my glasses!” I guess that wraps up ordering, for better or for worse. I turn back towards Emi, who seems a little more comfortable with the reassurance that food is on the way. She is quick to break the silence.  “So, I thought you were ditching us to be with Hanako. Did something come up?”   I give her a quick nod. “Yeah, she had some newspaper club business to attend to, so she had to cancel at the last second.” I hope I didn’t come off as too bitter, but if Emi thought so, she certainly gives me no indication.   “Oh well, I suppose that’s ok. You should know by now that I always get my way! Even fate is conspiring against you!” She gives me a knowing smirk, apparently satisfied with how things have turned out. I fake a sigh and throw up my hands in a mock show of despair.   “Well, can’t argue with that logic. So, what are you guys doing here anyway?”  “Well, me and Rin were going out to celebrate one last time before we graduate. Rin doesn’t want to commit to seeing me again because she ‘can’t predict the future’” Emi puts her fingers in an imitation of a quotation mark for added emphasis. Rin turns towards us at hearing her name being mentioned.  “Well, it doesn’t make sense to say ‘I’ll see you later’ when you don’t know if you will see them later, or when later is, or if they are still themselves when you see them.” She closes her eyes contemplating her wisdom. I should know better than to expect Rin to grasp colloquial metaphors, but it still manages to catch me off guard. Thankfully, Yuuko seems to have arrived with our drinks.   I stand up and help to prevent her from repeating what she did with the menus, an action she seems grateful for. It isn’t long before the sandwiches follow, and sandwiches eventually become desert. Yuuko brings three helpings of cake and pie to the table, each replesdent and garnished with decadent toppings. She takes care to set down the slices of lemon meringue pie, strawberry shortcake and a tea flavored cake before bowing out again. It didn’t take long for Emi to start devouring the strawberry cake in front of her as if she hadn’t been fed in days. I take a forkful of the lemon meringue pie before indulging myself. I give Emi an exaggerated expression to tease her, which proves to be a little too effective. In one swift movement, a flash of silver crosses my plate, carrying back with it a slice of the pie. Emi winks at me before sticking the plundered forkful in her mouth.  “Hey, I was eating that!” She grins at me, her mouth cluttered with bits of pastry.  “It’s ok, I just wanted to make sure I picked the right one.”   Meanwhile, Rin has decided to ponder the existence of the cake rather than consume it, leaving her feet under the table and placing her emerald eyes close to the tea cake. She doesn’t flinch, so much as acknowledge Emi as she completes her pastry tasting session. Aparently satisfied that she indeed chose the correct cake, she flourishes her fork before demolishing the remaining chunk of pink cake on her plate.  After we finish, Emi foots the bill for both Rin and her parts of the meal, and I do the same for mine. By some providence, the rain has relented, leaving the asphalt streets glistening with rain and oil runoff. The streets are quiet, with only the babbling trickle of water flowing into the storm drains punctuating the otherwise silent city. With the fear of the rain present in two of our minds, Emi and I manage to corral Rin back towards campus.  …"
katawashoujo,3ddi1k,Xilirite,3,Wed Jul 15 12:33:28 2015 UTC,"Ease  I’m unusually awake after being roused by the alarm clock, so it’s not long before I’m chasing my arrhythmia medication down with some cold tap water. The stuffed bear from the festival sits comfortably on my shelf and almost gives me a wink for good look today. I throw on my school uniform and grab my school bag before throwing open the door. The cold morning air is bracing and refreshing, a welcome change from the stuffy dorm I’ve become so used to. I half walk, half skip my way over to the girls’ dorm, careful to avoid the prying eyes of students heading to breakfast. Navigating the dorm has become an easy routine, and takes me but a minute to arrive at Hanako’s door. A quick rap on the door with my knuckle is all it takes to conjure a familiar pair of eyes. Hanako quickly opens the door, beckoning me inside.   In the time we’ve been together, Hanako has redecorated her room, adding a couple other token decorations to the once barren walls. Pictures of the two of us hang in colorful frames as I recall trips to the jazz club, picnics in the park and even an outing to the karaoke club. A neat row of porcelain dolls line the solitary bookshelf, standing tall next to a couple copies of Hanako’s favorite books. Even so, her room is more barren than most simply due to her taste in interior decoration and lack of a desire for material possessions.  I toss my bag to the side before lowering myself onto her bed, patting the area beside me in an effort to have Hanako sit close beside me. Hanako giggles before acquiescing, making a show before sitting down. She crosses her knees and leans away from me with a mock pouting face before she leans back in and puts her arms around my midsection I put one of my arms around her shoulder and pry the phone from her tiny hand. It doesn’t take me long to navigate the tiny menu to the recent calls section, in which my name is listed twice as opposed to Lilly’s full eight times, comprising the rest of the list.  “Are you ready?” I’m a tad apprehensive myself since I haven’t called her in a couple weeks, but her voice is always a welcome sound for sore ears. Hanako gives me a nod and I press the underused call button on Hanako’s phone and then activate the speakerphone function.  One ring, two rings, three rings. Finally, the receiver sparks to life.   Concord  “Hello? Lilly Satou speaking.” As expected, she answers the phone in English. Because of the regularity of the phone calls, I suppose she waits by the phone for the inevitable call from Hanako.  “Hi Lilly, it’s me, Hisao! Hanako and I are calling you together today, we hope you dont mind.”  “Oh Hisao, it’s so nice to hear your voice again! Of course I don’t mind the group conversation either, though I find the idea of you two calling me together rather amusing.” A heartwarming chuckle is just audible enough for Hanako and me to pick it up, bring a smile to both our faces. “So, tell me Hisao, how are things on your end? Based on what Hanako told me, finals should be over now, correct?”   “Finals went well on my end. I took your recommendations in English and managed to get a passable 83. It’s all thanks to your aptitude in teaching, of course.”  “Nonsense Hisao. You and I both know that your success is from the effort you put into your studies. Thank you for the kind words though.” As usual, Lilly’s altruistic nature shines from halfway around the world. It’s a shame that she had to move, but I find some comfort that Lilly seems to be happy.   “S-So Lilly,” Hanako pipes up, “have you made plans for the summer yet?”  “I was thinking of traveling a little, maybe flying out to visit you two if I get a chance, assuming I’m not too much of a burden. I wouldn’t want to get in the way of your busy lives of course.”  “Lilly, you know that Hanako and I will both make time for you. It’s still kind of lonely not having you around anymore/ Maybe one day you can stay for a little longer than just a short trip.” Hanako draws my arm closer to her body.  “I would love to move back at some point in the future, but father needs me here... “ Her voice trails off, obviously sparing us the internal family politics. I feel terrible for opening that can of worms since I’m sure Lilly didn’t need to be reminded of her family imposed isolation  Hanako decides to preempt any chance of an awkward silence.  “So Lilly, h-how is Akira doing? I haven’t talked with her in awhile.” Personally, I never got to know Akira that well, but I know Hanako and the Satou sisters have a longer history together.  “Akira is fine, just a little busy. Father has her working hard drafting new contracts since the company is growing so much.” Lilly seems think for a moment before speaking again. “So Hanako, how are things on your end? Have you heard back on the application yet?”  … Application?  Painful History  Hanako suddenly unlatches herself from me, suddenly finding the walls opposite me very interesting. Before I can ask what the application is about, Lilly seemed to have figured out that I wasn’t supposed to know about this ‘application’.  “Oh, um, I’ll talk to you later Hanako, ok?” Hanako shuts the phone without another word, and before I can ask her what’s going on, she is already reaching for her school bag. I can only sit in silence as Hanako slams the door, leaving me alone in her room.  What just happened?  I know Hanako has been reluctant to share her plans for next year with me, but I had assumed that was simply because she hadn’t made any yet. Something is obviously wrong, and I can’t help but feel hurt that Hanako doesn’t want to share what’s going on. At the same time, Lilly seems to know much more than I do about this. I can’t call her again in front of Hanako, but maybe she can tell me why Hanako is acting this way. At the same time, should I really go behind my girlfriend’s back? Do I really need Lilly to help bail me out again and tell me how to deal with Hanako?  Choices:  A: Resolve to call Lilly later  B: Try and deal with it myself  Strawpoll: http://strawpoll.me/4928640"

katawashoujo,3d96if,suggex,3,Tue Jul 14 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"Sakura is a spin-off story based on 'After The Dream', but from Kenji's point of view. His story is, as you might expect, unreliable and unique.  'After The Dream' is a post-Lilly-negative-end mosaic novel, about how everyone's life works out after that event. Most people tell me they read one arc at a time. The sequence in which they were written was Shizune, Lilly, Emi, Hanako, Rin and Misha. There are also arcs for several other characters which you can find labelled appropriately at the AtD link above.  Each arc probably takes about a day to read. They timeskip a lot: the ground covered is about seventy years or so for  some characters."

A physical release of the game is going to be held by them, however, at Comiket this year.  There are also certain VN development groups that were either created by KS fans and inspired by the game, or even created for the sake of developing new games ""inspired by"" or ""spiritually succeeding"" the game.  The second is usually much less warmly received than the first, because 4LS have described that they want no one to copy or modify material from the game."

katawashoujo,3d7amk,Dannflor,23,Tue Jul 14 02:21:38 2015 UTC,"To me, he wasn't comic relief. He was the villain of Shizune's route, and one of only two villains in the game (the other being the art teacher in Rin's route). He's a vile, horrible person who is directly responsible for any problems Shizune experiences."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,thatJainaGirl,11,Tue Jul 14 04:49:07 2015 UTC,the other being the art teacher in Rin's route   NOMIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.  Seriously fuck that guy.
katawashoujo,3d7amk,Ultra_HR,5,Tue Jul 14 09:52:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Nomiya is a real piece of shit."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,danbuter,6,Tue Jul 14 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"I actually like Nomiya, he kind of reminded me of the old mentor character type. Passionate about his teaching in art like Motuo in science. He saw great potential in Rin and wanted to take her under his wing and show people the next best artist. Yeah, he seems rather blind to Rin not wanting to paint for fame, rather just to be understood, but Hisao kind pushes her to actually do the exhibition. Nomiya losing his temper towards the end is no different than Hisao doing the same twice in the route. They both don't understand Rin at those points. Nomiya has some interesting things like his best friend being the same as Rin and losing him caused him to teach kids about the wonders of art."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,__path,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:30:18 2015 UTC,And this is why I love discussion threads -- that's something I never really considered about Nomiya. I just always hated him because he was a villain and didn't view things from Rin's point of view because I never tried to see the good in what he was trying to do.
katawashoujo,3d7amk,__path,2,Tue Jul 14 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't like him at when I read, during the initial feels from the route. But after awhile, he kind of stuck out as the mentor type. He does want to push Rin to do something she doesn't want to do, but he never force her to actually do it without consent. He kind of acts like Shizune in Act 1, trying to make Hisao join, but both Rin and Hisao join on their own will after some persuasion, but they never joined blindly.   For when Rin starts painting for the exhibition, he reminds me of Lilly, in sense that both look out for them and want to the best of them. Lilly watches over Hanako like a mother watching a child and she talks to Hisao like she is somewhat one in her route. While Nomiya can be seen as the parent that wants to the best of their child like those beauty pageants parents. Both are at different extreme in wanting the best for them. Lilly wants Hanako to open up at her own pace, while Nomiya wants to show his Rin to succeed where he failed. They both want the best of them, but with different agendas.   His temper blowout near the end of the route is justify by the fact that he never listen on Rin on what she wanted, only for what's best for her. He mentions that throughout the route. He put all this time to make the exhibition to come to that when Rin leaves (given if the reader makes the right choice for the good end), he'll blame her for his fault like a parent would when a child doesn't want to do something they are force to. But if the player makes the other choice, his dream comes true in that his star pupil will become a famous artist, but at the cost of Rin's purpose of wanting to be understood.  Rin only did it because of Hisao in hopes she'll find people who would understand her. But no one did, not even Hisao at the point. He still tried to but was thinking what's best for him/their relationship, rather than what's best for her. At times. his selfishness did pay off in helping Rin, but still, he was thinking about their relationship, not her somewhat."

katawashoujo,3d7amk,lespuka,3,Tue Jul 14 14:32:27 2015 UTC,I think a lot of people see him as irritating (and he can be much 'worse' in some routes).

katawashoujo,3d7amk,kyroshinai,8,Tue Jul 14 02:21:19 2015 UTC,"I still don't feel like that makes the choice outcome reasonable.

If a girl makes a move on you while upset, is it really so obvious that trying to still be friendly to her is going to end up leading to sex? Lol"
katawashoujo,3d7amk,Dannflor,7,Tue Jul 14 05:08:49 2015 UTC,I don't know if you should really be comforting the best friend of your girlfriend alone in your room at night right after she tried to make a move on you.
katawashoujo,3d7amk,FollowThePact,2,Tue Jul 14 06:54:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think there are really perfectly non-sexual ways for that to be able to play out. Whether she made a move or not, if you know she is vulnerable, there is such thing as being kind while still keeping your pants on. My thoughts, anyway."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,ExplosiveMcDanger,2,Tue Jul 14 06:58:40 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends how you interpret it. I didn't think it was all that vague personally, but I can see how it can be."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,Atario,2,Tue Jul 14 08:05:19 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I had thought I replied to you.  But if I was in Hisao's place, I have no clue what I would do in the situation. Every scenario in my head has me hurting my relationship with Misha, and like you said there is such a thing as being kind while keeping my pants on, but to me at least, that's not a strong enough thing to make Misha understand that what she was/is trying to do is kind of wrong.  I'm not sure if I could handle that situation of trying to comfort her, after she tried to kiss me. I'm not sure what I could say that would make it seem like I care for her, but not care for her in that way. And in the end I feel if I keep comforting her, it would just have her confused feelings for me grow stronger instead of going away.  That's what I think happened in the ""Comfort Misha"" option. I think Hisao was genuinely comforting Misha and she kept coming on to him, and that in this world that has Hisao ""comforting"" Misha that Hisao actually has feelings for her. Maybe it's because I had stronger feelings towards Misha than Shizune that I think that way.   When the ""Comfort Misha"" Hisao that I believe he is is genuinely comforting Misha, and Misha is coming on to Hisao, I don't think that Hisao would be able to control his feelings and as such act upon them.   Maybe it's just me, maybe you could actually do it, but if I was in Hisao's place I don't think I could handle the situation without hurting someone's feelings. I would honestly have to bring Misha to someone else, because I don't think I could do anything for the girl without hurting her feelings.  I like the vagueness of that choice, because in real life if I was in that situation I know that I wouldn't have a clue what to do in the situation."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:59:48 2015 UTC,"But, like, in a real situation, 'Comfort Misha"" is a pretty huge implication. Most of the time a woman wants you to comfort her, or if she had a really bad day and she needs to talk to someone (I.E. You), even if you had those intentions or not it kinda happens. It's human nature."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,Atario,7,Tue Jul 14 14:49:52 2015 UTC,"She makes a move on you, and specifically uses the word ""comfort"" in her request to go further.  There's not a lot of room for misinterpretation there…"
katawashoujo,3d7amk,__path,2,Tue Jul 14 13:03:34 2015 UTC,"There can be depending on how the player defines 'comfort.' If they use the more eastern/Japanese one, then there likely will be little confusion. If they use the western one, then I could see it."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,TheDwarfLard,6,Tue Jul 14 13:56:14 2015 UTC,"I really can't.  I mean:   She comes alone to your dorm After hours Shuts door Sits next to you on bed Kisses you Asks if you like her Buries her face in your chest Asks you to ""comfort"" her, ""just for today""   If I'm ever clueless enough to think that's not rocketing straight into sex, someone just put me out of my misery."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,Dannflor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:02:22 2015 UTC,"It's easy to mixed up the meaning of comfort because Hisao is trying his best to cheer Misha up beforehand, so when she comes into his room to ask to be comforted, people think she means just be there to support a shoulder, rather than fucking.   It's somewhat more obvious in the pre-release but the choice is determinant on a choice from Act 2 which is I like cause Misha will reference that choice if the player chooses that option than the other one."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,thatJainaGirl,0,Tue Jul 14 14:17:42 2015 UTC,"I'm focusing on the word itself, since that's brought up the most (I rarely see all the other elements listed, making me think that people focused on the word 'comfort' when reading)."

Lol   If that happened, I would nope out of there as fast I could. At least if I was loyal to my girlfriend ""Shizune"". No way I'd want to be near Misha if that happened."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,danbuter,8,Tue Jul 14 08:04:43 2015 UTC,"It's debatable whether this was intentional or if it was the writers covering their tracks afterward, but apparently the choices were left vague to give the player the same sense of confusion and uncertainty that Hisao had."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,Truthseiyer,8,Tue Jul 14 04:47:05 2015 UTC,Some of the vague choices can be alright. But there are just some where I feel like the choices directly go against the logic that could be safely assumed the players had.

But forget that, one thing that absolutely bit my balls was the fact that there was no dlc, hell, not even any real attempts to make any either. That's just a wish though. One thing that gets at me was also Shizune's route in general. As her father put it in his autobiography: Disgraceful, I bet they huffed glue. I think I'm getting a little carried away though, but maybe they should have just kept with the prerelease route instead. Also, needs more Kenji and Yuuko romance. Would have been great, too bad it failed to make the final cut. And screw it, because I'm rambling, I've always wanted to see a conversation between the Nurse and Akira. The fact that such a conversation does not exist makes me want to go out and roof houses in Bakersfield California for this world's misdeeds."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,TheDwarfLard,8,Tue Jul 14 02:13:46 2015 UTC,"I think Emi's was due to changing Emi's sprites, but running out of time for CGs (unless there's more to it than that). Several artists would work on the same image at times and some had much rougher lines than others. Sometimes they were cleaned up, sometimes they weren't (Lilly in the car is one of the more prominent examples, I believe)."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,NixonsRevenge,4,Tue Jul 14 02:16:29 2015 UTC,"Oh I forgot to add the lack of choices in Shizune's route. Also, I see what you mean with the art, makes sense."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,Dannflor,7,Tue Jul 14 02:21:21 2015 UTC,"People would say that Shizune's in control of the relationship, not Hisao, therefore he only gets a decisions when she's not around."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,NixonsRevenge,4,Tue Jul 14 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"But even then, they could have at least added a part where the choice doesn't really matter in the long run.

katawashoujo,3d7amk,xDrakeZx,15,Tue Jul 14 13:10:51 2015 UTC,"Ah well, just having finished writing a major story arc and thinking back at my relationship with KS...   I think that Shizune's route had the most meat if one were looking to redo KS or write a novel. She has a curiously missing mother, a crazy dad (perhaps as a result of the former), a peculiar sibling, a large home in Saitama, and a one-way love interest who is her best friend. It goes all the way to graduation and the all-too-true sadness that some feel at that point. The main problem is that you have to spend too much time filling in the blanks. I don't mind doing that (as some of you might know), but it's canonically a bit patchy. Lilly's route, on the other hand, is a traditional fantasy. In that vein, it's perfect. She has the peculiar sibling and the spare home, and both parents missing, and also a best friend who could be a one-way love interest (well, one way or the other). She's the anti-Shizune. It's also the best jumping-off point for continuation fanfics if you take the 'bad' ending. What I don't like is the inexplicable daftness of everyone in that route - they don't talk, they hide things from each other, they bring alcohol into a no-alcohol zone, and so on. It's not craziness, it's silliness. Emi's route is actually my favourite as a route, although I'm not the kind who likes Emi-type girls in particular. It has Nurse and Meiko taking major roles, and either of those can have their own story (or a combined story) as far as I'm concerned. It's what I think of as the baseline route, and I have no real grievances with it. Hanako's route deserves psychological analysis. It has a lot of potential meat too, but most of it is implied. It ends very early on, which is my one grievance with it. I wouldn't have minded a slightly longer route, really, possibly with elements from Lilly's route. Rin's route is even more deserving of psychological study. Except that in all the interminable debates about her possible autistic spectrum disorder, one forgets that it might just be the mindset of a person who paints with her feet. What I don't like about the route is how all your choices (to me, anyway) seem like jerk choices. Kenji's option is nice but brief. I suppose the main problem I have with the Kenji segments is the fact that they left out his library arc. You can find it elsewhere, spliced together from the canon bits available.   My biggest personal grievance, I have to conclude, is that KS could be better. But that's not to say it isn't already a great experience."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,Valjean_Lafitte,5,Tue Jul 14 05:07:21 2015 UTC,Hisao is just a plain and simple dick to Rin. I mean... I'm no good socially but... I feel that literally anyone in this thread myself included could've handled that route better than he.
katawashoujo,3d7amk,goofyomnivore,6,Tue Jul 14 07:00:54 2015 UTC,"Well, the Hisao that you're playing by that point is the same Hisao who couldn't get with any of the other girls -- Rin's route is, progression wise, basically a last resort, as to get to her you need to fail at getting with anybody else. The reason why Hisao is different in every route is because, unlike us, Hisao has no choices -- the choices we choose are just his first reactions.  And honestly, I'd be pretty upset if somebody spoiler We only had about 15 lines between that scene and Hisao's spoiler but Hisao had an entire week for that confusion and hurt to fester and feed off of itself. Remember, it glazed over the entire week with a general feeling of apathy and anger because he wasn't thinking about anything else but Rin.  Sure, he could've handled it better, but I never blamed Hisao for that. It's waaaaay too easy to take the view of a reader in that situation, but if you try to put yourself in Hisao's shoes -- not in that moment, but in the week leading up to it -- you'd probably find yourself pretty pissed off.  Or maybe I'm just as dumb as Hisao, who knows? :P"
katawashoujo,3d7amk,TheDwarfLard,2,Tue Jul 14 13:54:45 2015 UTC,"I disliked the lack the choices you get In Her Own Image scene. To me all are almost the same, wanting Rin to go for it. If there wasn't a flowchart I wouldn't have guessed that choosing any of the options would have changed the story in any way.   Maybe from Hisao's point of view he wants her to change and I don't mind it at all but having different options would have been more healthy."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,goofyomnivore,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"Is that the scene near the end of Act 2? I think that choice isn't supposed to be about directing the story, but rather directing who Hisao is and what kind of attitude he has. Like I said -- Hisao didn't have any choices, that was just what he would have said. I actually really like those choices -- it's a great example of changing the route in a way that doesn't just lead to a different ending, and I really like that idea.  As a side note, I've actually never played Rin's route by going down the path that results in you spoiler"
katawashoujo,3d7amk,Mrfish31,5,Tue Jul 14 19:18:04 2015 UTC,"one-way love interest (well, one way or the other).   If the 'one way' is Hanako having feelings for Hisao, sure (there's text that even implies it, IIRC), but if you mean Hanako having feelings for Lilly, eh... I just can't see it. But if there's a reason to think she might see Lilly as more than a friend, I'd love to hear it.   What I don't like is the inexplicable daftness of everyone in that route - they don't talk, they hide things from each other, they bring alcohol into a no-alcohol zone, and so on. It's not craziness, it's silliness.   What's weird is that was exactly my problem with Shizune's route. No one talks about anything; sex, betrayal, depression, hurt feelings, they're all either swept under the rug or dealt with off-screen. It's frustrating.   The thing about bringing alcohol into a no-alcohol zone really can't be blamed on anyone but Akira, though, and she seems like the reckless type."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,goofyomnivore,10,Wed Jul 15 19:23:15 2015 UTC,I wish the timeline was a little easier to follow. A date / time ticker in the top corner would have been helpful.  Pretty much all of Lilly's route after Context I disliked. I thought the four honest or dishonest choices with Lilly would develop Hisao's character enough to fight for her/be honest about his feelings at The Shanghai. Didn't care for the airport/heart attack bailout/hospital/time skip epilogue either.  I thought it was strange Hanako's H-scene didn't have a choice like Misha's. I thought that would have been interesting breaking point compared to hounding her at the door.
katawashoujo,3d7amk,superhanson2,6,Tue Jul 14 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"The only timeline time I'm nearly positive on in terms of an ending is that Hanako's good ending is on the 17th of July (though, it could be a bit earlier). A few dates stick out, such as birthdays if they pop up and events, but they can be difficult to work with at times.  As for Hanako's sex scene, he committed to doing what he did pretty early on (he even says something like 'I want her. All of her.') And as clueless as Hisao is sometimes, he did pick up on her signals pretty well during that scene. He could have done better, but overall did well."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,guitarplayer213,3,Tue Jul 14 02:39:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured teenage hormones were in control of him, but I played Hanako's route after Shizune's and I was expecting a Misha type of choice to pop up. Its not really a complaint of mine just an observation.  Hanako's H-scene is arguably the best in the game at accomplishing what it set out to do imo."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,NoviceElectromancer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:08:55 2015 UTC,"Hanako's scene didn't have a choice?  That's odd. I played through the route yesterday, and I could only get to that scene by going down Hanako's good ending ( choosing to go to town, and then choosing to take Lilly's advice )  If you went down the bad or neutral endings the game ended in the scene immediately after you ring Lilly for advice, either with Misstep, BAD or  Cut Petals, NEUTRAL, and you do not see the H-scene."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,thatJainaGirl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:49:02 2015 UTC,I meant like to 'comfort' her or not. A choice in the heat of the moment like Misha's.

katawashoujo,3d7amk,OneManArmy77,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:55:20 2015 UTC,"A lot of people don't like her because she can seem like the 'villain' of Act I, where people have already had their first impressions and stick with them for some time. In some cases, it might be due to preferences towards other characters/girls. If someone likes Lilly, a fair chance exists that the person won't like Shizune. It's not unheard of for someone to like both (or neither), of course.  As for Hanako, do you have reasons for disliking her that you don't mind sharing? As long as you're decent about it, I don't really have an issue (I've seen some pretty cruel arguments against Hanako in the past...)."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,__path,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:04:18 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point that you've brought up there about first impressions. Personally though her bitchiness in act 1 never really came off as bitchiness to me. Despite my love of Lilly I still can't blame Shizune for the way she treated her I mean... Shizune is horribly overworked and has no direct way to communicate to her.     Anyway don't worry about the Hanako thing, I don't dislike her for any cruel reason. I personally just don't really like the whole quiet girl thing and... well... I did really like some moments from her route (Chess FTW) but... I got tired of her personality REALLY quickly. I felt the writers failed to give her real variation and at a certain point it felt like I was just reading the same conversation over and over again."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,OneManArmy77,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:15:13 2015 UTC,"Due to my own personality, quiet girls just 'make more sense' to me. A lot of it may seem similar on the outside, but getting into her mindset can fill in quite a lot (and it's incredibly easy for me to do anyway). And after everything happened (complete with withdrawing/being forced into her shell), expressing herself can be difficult to do without complications, nervousness setting in, etc.  Because her route focuses on reaching a relationship as opposed to maintaining one, everything might seem kind of slow. If you look at each step Hanako takes (in terms of progression of the story and 'overcoming' her shyness) and measure the distance between them, you aren't going to have much there (except in some select scenes). But if you look at the difference between Hanako and Hisao's first encounter in the library to the final CG in her good ending, there's an incredibly amount of progress there, something the old Hanako wouldn't have even thought of or believed was possible. After her good ending, there would be more visible variation, but she is and likely will always be an inward person. She'd expand her friendship circle beyond Lilly and Hisao (relationship as well with Hisao) to include more, but it's not as if she'll suddenly have 50 friends by the end of the year."

katawashoujo,3d7amk,Gore_Lily,14,Tue Jul 14 03:56:42 2015 UTC,"I really think that the game's weakest point is it's choice system overall. There are a multitude of problems with it that really bug me, especially looking back.  For one, everyone knows that the choices can be really vague at times. However, this problem is made worse by the fact that there are very few choices at all, and even less that really matter in the end.  Just look at the Shizune route flowchart -- it's literally one choice, splitting off into good or bad ending. Every other choice doesn't matter, and the once choice that does is unreasonably vague. It makes you feel cheated when you get the bad ending -- you didn't make a bad choice, you were presented with awful wording.  The route that did the choices best, I feel, was Emi's route, as you could have a drastically different story depending on which choices you make. My first time through, I ended up going down the bad ending, but made the right choices and ended up heading back up for the good ending, and it made a world of difference in the tone of the route for me."

He's oblivious to the fact that he is, in fact, being insensitive. What annoys me so much about his relationship with Kenji is that there are multiple times when Hisao clearly thinks ""You know, Kenji's kind of bizarre, but he means well and really tries to be friendly with me."" Then nothing. He keeps acting exactly the same way as he was before. It's been a while since I last read KS, but the only time I can remember when Hisao considers Kenji's feelings is spoiler"

The reason why Hisao is different in every route is because, unlike us, Hisao has no choices -- the choices we choose are just his first reactions.  And honestly, I'd be pretty upset if somebody We only had about 15 lines between that scene and Hisao's but Hisao had an entire week for that confusion and hurt to fester and feed off of itself. Remember, it glazed over the entire week with a general feeling of apathy and anger because he wasn't thinking about anything else but Rin.  Sure, he could've handled it better, but I never blamed Hisao for that. It's waaaaay too easy to take the view of a reader in that situation, but if you try to put yourself in Hisao's shoes -- not in that moment, but in the week leading up to it -- you'd probably find yourself pretty pissed off.

It's probably because I have and have been around alot of psychological problems though, so I can see why many others might be in the opposite situation."

katawashoujo,3d7amk,__path,2,Tue Jul 14 12:33:25 2015 UTC,"My least favorite thing about the game is the inconsistent polish between routes. I played through Hanako's route first and Rin's second and I was amazed at how much more unique artwork there was. There were more characters, more locations, more actual stuff happens, more everything. Playing through Lilly's route after that further confirmed this. I loved Hanako's route but it seemed like it didn't get nearly polish compared to other routes."
katawashoujo,3d7amk,__path,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:12:26 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite things about Rin's route that nobody else seems to talk about is how many more unique locations there are than in other routes. Excluding the characters' rooms, Hanako has that club, Lilly has the restaurant, the spoilers and her house, Shizune has her house, and Emi has her house and the shed ;). Everywhere else you can see at least once in the first act. However, Rin has the nighttime city (otherwise only go there in the day), the art exhibition and the atelier, the art room, the woods, and the dandelion field.  Also I agree, Hanako's route does feel a bit rough around the edges at times :/"

katawashoujo,3d7amk,Atario,2,Tue Jul 14 16:06:25 2015 UTC,The one thing that has always bugged me was that two bottles of wine got three people really drunk and one just kinda. That'd be two glasses each.
katawashoujo,3d7amk,__path,3,Tue Jul 14 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it.. That seems a bit excessively weak of them, even for inexperienced teenagers. I didn't really think too deeply into it since I don't really drink wine myself. Maybe Hisao dropped a couple of roofies?"
katawashoujo,3d7amk,Atario,2,Tue Jul 14 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"He wasn't the person who brought the wine, that was Akira (and she wouldn't do that anyway). Hisao more or less handled it fine (and Akira did as well), but Hanako and Lilly didn't. It affected Hanako more, but her build is relatively small and her tolerance likely isn't that great."

katawashoujo,3d6yp2,EinsteinReplica,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:42:46 2015 UTC,"Why not ? Rin is someone that whant to make art for art nothing less  Remember when you met her in front of the wall and the thing she said about that guy who paint blind ? Doing thing you can't because you can do it.   That's RIN. She want to do art because she CAN do it , she wan to pain , just...to paint nothing else She doesn""t want rules , or objectives or any sh#t like that , she just want to express herself and let her mind do whatever the F it want.   You don't have to get a point to paint , you just paint for you , for express your feels , for express yourself , just because you CAN do it.  That's how Rin wanna do thing and that's why when , at the art galery , when she get rules she turned crazy ( smoke , cry , bipolarity... ) because she doesn't want rules.  Rin have hard time to speak , so she paint to express what she can't say.  The Rin's arc is , in my opinion , everything about ART is. That's a artistic point of view of what art is or should be. And that's a metaphore in the game: Rin (art) should not be with rules ! When you add rules you break the main thing of the whole thingy... and everything colapse...   Look at 4 Leaf Studio , they did this game for what purpose ? For money ? For popularity ? No not a single bit , they did this foe ART. To express theirself ! To share their though , their feels their opinions and what they think !  That's what art is , expressing and sharing !   Does Picasso was a popular and rich person ? No he was poor an loniless but he never stop doing art ! Does Van gogh was popular and rich ? Hell no , guy sell paint to buy alcool... what a poor man.. she was alone , with a ear cuted. But did he stoped painting ? Hell no !   Sorry for beeing long... I hope you understood me , between my bad english and some word I lost sometime it could be hard to understand.  I also hope you understand more RIn and Rin's arc now :)  Have a great day , I will still here to discuss if you want , next time I will try to be shorter"
katawashoujo,3d6yp2,Dafty-,7,Fri Jul 17 12:13:17 2015 UTC,I can't say that Rin's my favourite route but she is most definitely one of my favourite characters. Her thoughts and feelings are so much deeper than any of the other girls and always make you think.
katawashoujo,3d6yp2,suggex,2,Tue Jul 14 00:52:57 2015 UTC,"This is why she is my favorite. Just the Depth and ""quirkieness"" is something i found very enjoyable"

katawashoujo,3d6yp2,Dafty-,2,Tue Jul 14 16:20:35 2015 UTC,Rin by far had the lowest low for me personally. Thats why when i got the good ending it was super rewarding and it turned into my favorite route
katawashoujo,3d6qut,Flametoss456,3,Mon Jul 13 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"Hanako and Lilly are perfectly equal in difficulty to reach their routes, and Shizune is in the same area (just on the other side of the choices). Rin's actually the more difficult to reach. Emi's route is incredibly easy to reach and is often the first route people read.   After all is said and done, I realized the game is over and was actually saddened it was over.   It's not technically over if you decide to read the other routes. You don't have to if you don't want to, of course."

As for the other routes, it's not incredibly likely that it'll be the same experience. You might hate Lilly's route, but love Rin's. It's not something I can really say definitively."

Actually, the idea is good and the execution is fine, but it could do with more work and polish. As it stands, it's far too rushed. You have a long, partly elegiac, partly uplifting story to tell. Don't speed through it as if you're making a two-minute speech! :)"

She met Natsume and Naomi, which soon filled – yet not completely - the void that Lilly left in her life. She traveled, laughed and became almost a new person.    Here it feels like you're implying Hanako and Hisao fell away from each other and Hanako became a new person, but in the end nothing seems* to be changed.  Really good story, though a bit short like /u/brythain said. :P"

katawashoujo,3czj4f,TheQuantanamo,7,Sun Jul 12 05:07:24 2015 UTC,"So, before playing any of the final game itself, your friend suggested you play one of the pre-release routes?   ...  Shizune's pre-release is incredible, but please bear in mind that it's nothing at all like the final route, which is well worth reading, in my opinion; there are some things I think you'll find were handled better in the final version of the route (especially if you're a Misha fan). Also, it's worth mentioning that the pre-release was never meant to be seen by anyone. There's some good stuff in there, no doubt about it, but KS devs mostly seem embarassed by their earlier work. So with that being said, I hope playing the early version of Shizune's route hasn't tinted your expectations for what's to come in the final. The pre-release and final are wildly different from each other, and I hope that as you play the official routes that you can appreciate the great strides in writing quality Anonymous22 and the other writers made."
katawashoujo,3czj4f,Valjean_Lafitte,2,Sun Jul 12 13:53:05 2015 UTC,"I only followed the suggestion of my friend at that time, and that was to play the pre-release instead for Shizune's route. Still intent on reading the final release of the other routes, as well as Shizune's."
katawashoujo,3czj4f,Mrfozmoppler,4,Sun Jul 12 16:13:18 2015 UTC,"It's always great when someone else discovers this great game. I pretty much felt the same way when I started to play, I didn't expect much, but it ended up being one of the best experiences I've had in a game. I'm glad you were able to enjoy it as well."
katawashoujo,3czj4f,Mrfozmoppler,3,Sun Jul 12 05:26:10 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I wasn't quite used to something as emotional as this and I initially didn't expect much of the experience, as you did.  I should thank my friend for introducing me to this fantastic game. In fact, I'll go do that right now."
katawashoujo,3czj4f,Qwant_,2,Sun Jul 12 05:30:30 2015 UTC,I probably cried more during Lilly's route than during the past ten years of my life. I envy that you'll get to play all of the routes for the first time.

It's hard to think of, say, The Legend of Zelda without hearing the overworld theme in your head. Same goes for Katawa Shoujo. Painful History and Moment of Decision number among the greatest music I've heard from a game, or at all, really. Point is, a good soundtrack is a crucial part of a great game.

katawashoujo,3cz4jm,ChocolateBadger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:50:11 2015 UTC,As a theme for KS? I'm not sure where you're getting that idea. I think it should be Mass Effect's main theme. It even takes songs from it's soundtrack and combines them into something even more awesome. The lyrics too sum up ME pefectly.

If they likely aren't, tell them what it meant to you perhaps. But if they are, then additional information might not be needed.  Though, I can't be certain as I've only referred it to one person (and that was before I read/saw any of it it, actually)."
katawashoujo,3cvudn,TheDwarfLard,9,Sat Jul 11 05:22:16 2015 UTC,"It depends honestly.  Does your friend like Anime? Is your friend open minded?  KS is often considered a ""Gateway"" VN in that it's nothing too expansive like some other VNs that are...60+ hours PER ROUTE.   KS is fairly small (Sadly) for a VN but it's a good starter. So I'd say if they are open minded, want some feels and enjoy anime? I'd definitely go for it.  I'd also recommened just letting them go about it on their own. They will likely enjoy it more if you show them and then leave them to their own devices.  I got my friend into it pretty easily but he already liked Anime and played VNs before so...it was easy."

My friend pitched it like an actual novel instead of a dating sim, stressing that the story drove him to tears and was very engrossing. So he sent me the link to the website and, after a few days of playing, I came out very impressed.  Point being, it shouldn't be pitched as a cripple fucking simulator."

You could also try to point to a few of the many, many, many ""I've just finished the game and my life is changed"" on here as proof of it being something special (The non-spoiler ones).   I will also say, the anime art turns a lot of non-anime fans off, so be weary of that."

Also, remember that people's interests can change, and that they can be surprisingly varied. For instance, when I was growing up, I read just about every fantasy and science fiction book in my library. Then I discovered alternative comics. Also, I spent a number of hours reading computer visual novels such as Heart de Roommate a decade ago. These days, it takes effort for me to read a portable console VN such as Steins;Gate for Vita."

After your message Katawa Shoujo opens up.   Depending on how demented you are you can not allow them food or drink.

katawashoujo,3ctemd,MaybeNickCage,8,Fri Jul 10 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"So, today is Hanako's birthday and that has got me thinking about how long you guys have known about Katawa Shoujo. I started lurking here back in January and didn't post until a few months latter. I first found about about Katawa Shoujo sometime last year but I didn't bother reading it when I first found out about it because I don't like anime all that much so I thought I wouldn't like it. I ended up watching it on Millbee's channel last December because I had nothing to else to do during winter break. And now I'm wondering how long have you guys been on the subreddit? And how did you find out about Katawa Shoujo?  Side note from all of that, if anyone is in the D&D group, the first session is today at 9 Pm GMT, and will go from anywhere to 1/2 an hour to about 1 hour give or take."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,goobernuts19,6,Fri Jul 10 17:08:18 2015 UTC,"I found out about Katawa Shoujo while looking for free games to play. I was intrigued but I too lazy to download it because of the size of the download. A few months after my first break up, Inside Gaming played it (not seriously though) and it sparked interest in me. I ended up playing it and I loved it. I subbed not long after I first played it. That was roughly a year ago."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,TomokoNoKokoro,3,Fri Jul 10 17:25:08 2015 UTC,"I think I found it soon after I heard about visual novels, around October of last year or so (maybe a bit earlier). I've seen them mentioned in a few places before, and one day curiosity got me and I checked out /r/visualnovelsuggest. KS was mentioned as a good starting VN there, so I proceeded to download it. I never thought it was going to be a ""cripple-fucking game"" (as some people so elegantly put it xD); in fact, I went in with almost no expectations. I first played Hanako's route because I've always kinda had a thing for that kind of person/personality (even IRL, which is something that contributed to how I felt when I got the bad ending the first time) and sort of related to that, as well."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,OneManArmy77,3,Fri Jul 10 18:28:15 2015 UTC,"First crossed my radar with Millbee, but it took me until about 6 weeks ago to really play it."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,Gore_Lily,2,Fri Jul 10 18:33:04 2015 UTC,"I started following KS on /a/ and /v/ a few months before Act 1, so this would have been late 2008, early 2009ish. Even back then there was a surprising amount a fan art and speculation, along with regular updates to the dev blog like this April Fools joke. I think the Misshimie was up around this time, too. I lurked /ksg/ for a while, but haven't checked it out since I started using reddit and this sub a few years ago.   For D&D, I have a new character that's more or less completed already, so hopefully I can pass that on to you for approval then start helping anyone who needs it."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,goofyomnivore,2,Fri Jul 10 18:36:47 2015 UTC,"I found the game by chance really. I was depressed one day and wanted to play a sad game. I guess it is true misery loves company. Google suggested me KS if you're looking for some feels.  I played KS about a year ago fell in love with it and lurked forums/reddit for a few months afterwards. Had some real life shiz happen to me, and pretty much didn't get on the internet again for 6-7 months, but recently started lurking again and trying my hand at writing."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,lespuka,2,Fri Jul 10 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"I found out about ks about a couple months ago, when playing it for fun with a couple of friends. I left relatively early and was kind of intrigued by it. They finished it without me, but I started a playthrough on my own a couple days later. It was a great experience, and I would like to be able to feel the ""first time"" again with KS.  As for the sub, I've been subscribed for a while that I can't remember. I only really got reddit for this sub."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,daan831,2,Fri Jul 10 18:57:36 2015 UTC,I basically found KS through exactly the same way as you did.
katawashoujo,3ctemd,Dannflor,2,Fri Jul 10 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"From Millbeeful, and I am now rewatching his series for the 4th time. :P  I started frequenting this subreddit a couple months ago. So I haven't been here long. In fact, my first full playthrough of the game myself was around that time as well."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,Phoenixeye0,2,Fri Jul 10 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"I still plan on being there tonight. I believe I sent you my info already, so I'll be online shortly. To the other players, I'll have PDFs of any books you might need, which should only be the players handbook."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,suggex,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:14:33 2015 UTC,"I think I found out about it about two years ago, though I have no idea how. I might have been looking for new games to play and found it on some list. But man am I happy that I did find it, since my first play though two years ago I have never been able to stop thinking about it."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,PaperAirship,6,Fri Jul 10 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not really one for figurines, however there are always exceptions. This lovely lady is my one un-regrettable purchase for the year, beating Fallout 4 Pip-Boy Edition for the honour of ""Piece of Plastic Sitting on My Shelf"".  In other news, the new anime season has started, and I've been searching for something to fill the void that Yuriphonium! has left inside me. I have a terrible attention span, and so far only a few have managed to hold my interest:  Charlotte: I'm going in with the promise that ""It'll be around as good as Angel Beats."" If it succeeds at that, I will be satisfied. I enjoyed the first episode, and the MC is a wonderful asshole, complete with awkward bouts of evil laughter. There's no sign of the titular Charlotte yet, however I'm hoping for the return of Mitchon, who has some serious best girl potential if she shows up again.  Non Non Biyori Repeat: I'm not actively watching this one week-to-week. Rather, I'm saving it for when I have a particularly bad day, that way I can bask in the healing powers it provides. It's more of the same from the first season, and that's all everyone ever wanted.  Monster Musume: Have you ever woken up, stepped outside, and felt the warmth of the sun on your face as you breath in deeply and think to yourself ""Isn't life just wonderful?"", before going back inside and locking the doors and windows because you have no more need for the 3D world? I was promised monster girls. I got monster girls. 10/10, Miia best monster."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,UnknownMango,3,Fri Jul 10 17:25:26 2015 UTC,"1) Yuriphonium cannot be called that because no noteworthy Yuri occurs (im sticking with Hibigay)  2) Charlotte seems good i agree, bet it goes down the redundant MC route though.   3) Say anything bad or at all dismissive of Non Non Biyori and I'll fly to Canada and cut you. Its precious. I love it more than I love my daughter.  4) Miia is Isla, ergo you have good taste."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,goobernuts19,2,Fri Jul 10 20:37:12 2015 UTC,I never thought I needed yuri till I watched hibike

katawashoujo,3ctemd,PaperAirship,3,Fri Jul 10 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"I remember there were a couple high quality ones of I believe Rin and Shizune made a couple years ago. They were custom ordered from a professional company and ran upwards of $300 however, as well, they were getting dangerously close to crossing 4LS's stance on merchandizing.  Other than that, someone was posting their 3D printed models of the girls in this sub a couple of weeks ago, but they were obviously not as high-quality"
katawashoujo,3ctemd,lespuka,6,Fri Jul 10 19:06:02 2015 UTC,"I've been gaming, playing the piano and watched anime. Recently finished Amane's route in GnK, and now only have Michiru left. And happy birthday to Hanako.  EDIT: Fuck it, I finished Michiru's route. Had me crying for... well, minutes. Which is pretty much in my opinion."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,HazelKim,4,Fri Jul 10 18:05:08 2015 UTC,Nice.
katawashoujo,3ctemd,Phoenixeye0,2,Fri Jul 10 19:10:27 2015 UTC,I'm going to start this one soon. Any suggestions on a route I should try first?
katawashoujo,3ctemd,HazelKim,3,Fri Jul 10 20:12:19 2015 UTC,Makina's is a good first route because you learn lots about the protagonist. But just do whomever you like after you've read the common route. Choices :D
katawashoujo,3ctemd,Phoenixeye0,2,Fri Jul 10 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I just recently finished Kono Oozora ni, Tsubasa wo Hirogete (""If My Heart Had Wings"" by MoeNovel's garbage standards). I know that GnK is incredibly dark by comparison from what I'm told, granted that doesn't say much considering this one has been very light hearted, but still good. My biggest gripe I think was how incredibly long you have to wait into the common route to even start making decisions (around 5 hours or so before first choice). Is GnK like that as well?"
katawashoujo,3ctemd,lespuka,2,Fri Jul 10 20:48:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, GnK has a fairly long common route, but I didn't mind, personally."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,lespuka,2,Fri Jul 10 21:20:10 2015 UTC,"Like /u/HazelKim said, Makina is a pretty good first route. I had already seen the anime so I knew essentially everything about the protagonist anyways though. I personally ended up with Sachi on my first go. But for me so far, there is no route you ""shouldn't"" take. Maybe Amane's route is a bit weird if you don't know much about the protagonist, but it should be fine nonetheless."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,Disabled-fist,3,Fri Jul 10 21:19:18 2015 UTC,I cried like a bitch during the wheat field scene during lilly's route. Never really cried to any movies before or in recent memory.
katawashoujo,3ctemd,suggex,5,Fri Jul 10 18:34:44 2015 UTC,Just reading this and remembering the scene is enough for me to get misty eyes. It's incredible what influence this VN has over me even years after I first played it.
katawashoujo,3ctemd,Disabled-fist,3,Fri Jul 10 18:39:02 2015 UTC,"I dont even want to do any of the other routes now, Emotionally destroyed is how I would describe it."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,suggex,3,Fri Jul 10 18:40:46 2015 UTC,"Then don't. At least not right away. Relish the lingering feelings and thoughts as long as you can. When it starts to wear off, then give it another try, get on the emotional roller coaster again and play another route, you'll love it, like we all did."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,OneManArmy77,5,Fri Jul 10 18:47:07 2015 UTC,"So, Im busy starting up a shorter visual novel and Im in the process of developing the storyboard, but its taking a bit due to my work and summer classes. I dont have it polished enough to show right now, but I am curious to see if anyone else would be interested in working on it with me. I will say that I have pretty high standards and Im not quite sure if I need help with the actual writing quite yet, but Im definitely going to need help with the art and music.  As for the plot itself, it follows a day in the life of a couple 4th graders during summer vacation who are playing a pseudo game of capture the flag (think the holy grail war from F/SN but with kids and a plastic beer chalice instead) I want to push the idea of what a VN can be as a medium instead of putting out the standard fare of dating sim and futuristic themed VNs. I'm new to building a VN, so its going to be a little bit of a challenge, but it should be a fun experience. If you are interested, PM me or reply here, and then we can move over to skype to see if we can work together."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,gekiganwing,2,Fri Jul 10 18:49:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for mentioning this, OneManArmy77. Writing can be tough. I know this from experience. Let me try to be specific...   Real life obligations get in the way. Murphy's Law related problems can occur. For instance, the computer you were using might have a blue screen of death, and you end up lose hours or days of writing. Or there's a sudden power outage. It's easy to get distracted by hobbies and entertainment. It's just as easy to get bogged down by perfectionism. Boredom can also be a problem. If you don't have a passionate interest in telling your story, you might lose interest and leave it unfinished.   If you need help, be sure to ask. You might find people willing to assist you on the Lemma Soft forums. If you're active on a community such as Tumblr or DeviantArt, then search either of those for 'visual novel', and look for people who can help you, and relevant places to get assistance."
katawashoujo,3ctemd,OneManArmy77,2,Sat Jul 11 04:37:30 2015 UTC,"Oh Im already on Lemmasoft and am quietly plucking away.

Wish I could have gone, but someone has to pay the bills around here. I got some extra free time now to watch anime/try and write so all is not lost. Started watching Spice and Wolf. I'm only three episodes in, but it is entertaining so far. I finished Clannad too, and I liked it quite a bit. I'm going to dl the VN later, but I plan on spending the rest of the day writing a KS fic I've been working on the past few days.  I'm praying for a Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC soon for my gaming fix. I've played Witcher 3 to death, and I've played far too much LoL the past few weeks.  Almost forgot -- Happy Birthday Hanako."

KS is incredibly emotional and powerful, so you can feel overwhelmed. Third, you have a lot of good years ahead of you. Yeah, it sucks that you havent met your Lilly yet, but you gotta get out there and find her too. Just take some time and think about how you can reasonably get out there and meet more people. You really want to find your Lilly? Get out there and find her then before giving up and resigning yourself to being forever alone.  Ill be around tomorrow to talk if you want to talk. PM me and we can talk over reddit or skype if you need a sympathetic ear. You might be alone right now, but it doesnt have to stay that way either."
katawashoujo,3cr86u,OneManArmy77,7,Fri Jul 10 04:37:08 2015 UTC,"Naw, this dude is looking for a friend too.  Anyway, on a more serious note.  Look through this album please. Read it learn it love it. I didn't create the words, some random anon out in the wilds of the internet did, but I made the macros to convey what I thought were the most important points from the source.  Here is the source image that floats around everywhere.  Next, on a less inspirational note.  Don't fall into that trap of forever alone bullshit. Like all other sources of negativity based from emotion and passion it can quickly send you into a self-sustaining cycle of self-defeating attitudes and behaviors. Take some time off from KS such things in general. You gotta allow yourself to regain equilibrium.  Now back on a inspirational note.  Take your time off and then come back to this comment. You can only put this information to use when you've recovered. Trying to do so now in your current state won't work.  Okay, back at your center?  Read this comment by another redditor. It's long but read the WHOLE GODDAMNED thing. The words put down by this guy more than earned him his 10k upvotes and 53 gildings. What this dude said applies to EVERYTHING.   You wanna change the fact that there's no one in your life right now? That comment is the very first step. Use it as your foundation.  Now I may be overstepping my bounds here, but just in case you need a little extra help. Why am I linking this? Because I believe much of what the ""Doc"" talks about makes sense. Take a look around, read some of the articles here and there.  It may take awhile but you got this."

Just like you I looked up from the screen and realised that I am not Hisao, I am not loved by this amazing girl and that I am indeed utterly alone. But that is what I love about this novel, it makes me feel happy when I play it and even if it can be devastation when it ends, it is still amazing. I highly recommend you playing through the otherwise routes, they're all great and all emotional roller coasters."
katawashoujo,3cr86u,suggex,2,Fri Jul 10 15:10:31 2015 UTC,"You know, relationships aren't the only type of love. If you feel lonely, try hitting up a family member or perhaps a really close friend.

A lot of the projects in this list have died quietly, and some of the URLs currently lead to parked domains. So if you can't access a site, then try to unearth it by using Archive.org.  The people at Somnova Studios said during January 2015 that they would either release a demo of Missing Stars by 2016, or just let their project die quietly.  Salty Salty Studios' planned story Work in Progress is still alive. Scalemail's hybrid adventure game Walkerman had a successful Kickstarter, and is going along well. The Human Reignition Project's successful Kickstarter is just now wrapping up, and the story should be released in the near future.

katawashoujo,3ckkb0,FollowThePact,16,Fri Jul 10 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"I like to think that it's the fault of Mr Satou that Jigoro is the way he is, alongside other things. In my head, the family business is Jigoro's business, but was given the Satou name due to a funding agreement. Jigoro didn't have enough startup money, and asked his fiancée's brother for a loan. Due to being the sole member of his family, Satou made him agree to sign the business to their family name so it could continue after the Hakamichi line died.  This is the cause for conflict between the two families, only amplified by the death of Mayoi (Shizune's mother) because there is no longer a central link between the families. Jigoro wants his business back now that he has a son to carry the family name forward, but Satou refuses to change the name now that he runs most of the operation. This is why the fight between Shizune and Lilly only happens the year before the events of the VN. Mayoi died then, and tensions between the family ignited, creating rifts between everyone. Akira ignored the pettiness because she'd practically been raised by Jigoro after Mr Satou left for Scotland.  There are a few small details in Shizune's route that support the recent death of Mayoi, such as the shells in the omelettes that Jigoro made. In an effort to be hospitable to Shizune's new boyfriend, he tried to cook something nice. His wife did he cooking before, and he is a slow learner (supported by him not having learned sign) and hasn't fully adapted yet. His outlandish fashion and the sword also support the theory, as his wife probably didn't let him carry a katana around near the children, and likely wanted him dressing smart for business reasons. With her gone, he enjoys some new freedoms. The business cards that say Hakamichi Industries on them are just his attempts at stealing back the business by changing the recognised name, the originals have Satou's name and face on them.  To summarise, Mr Satou is a massive dick and Jigoro is actually a victim of injustice and suffered a tragic life. His autobiography is actually a VERY interesting read, as it covers the loss of his last family members, his depression, the beginnings of his business and relationship with the Satous and eventually raising his kids without their mother.  All that said, I fully understand why everyone thinks he's a douche, most people don't go into that much detail about characters they are supposed to hate.   Old post of mine that I think applies here. He's a jackass until you look at the finer details surrounding his character and consider the reason for their existence."

katawashoujo,3ckkb0,TrebbleBiscuit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:01:30 2015 UTC,"Not so. If a concrete reason as to why he acts a such is presented (mind you i'm ALMOST done Shizune's arc) to me, then i will have an understanding of his actions and would at least be able to see past his meanness. But I, as of yet, have no such evidence and thus cannot level with Jigoro. As much is I wish to be able to enjoy the conversions hes in, that's just not something i'm capable of doing at this time."
katawashoujo,3ckkb0,joeylos2001,5,Wed Jul 8 18:34:24 2015 UTC,"Breaking the haha in jokes here:  Jigoro is probably the closest thing to a true ""bad guy"" the story has. He's a gigantic asshole and basically every problem Shizune and Hideaki have is based squarely on his shoulders. He's completely unaware of the completely devastating effect he's had on his family (especially Shizune), and he is convinced he has literally no flaws.  In writing, there is a trope called the Moral Event Horizon.. This is the point in a character's arc where they do something so evil that they can no longer be redeemed. Examples in other video games include the Lone Wanderer detonating Megaton in Fallout 3 or Kefka poisoning Doma Castle's water supply and killing hundreds of innocents in Final Fantasy VI. Jigoro, in my eyes, is the only character to cross the Moral Event Horizon in Katawa Shoujo, when he tells Hisao that he believes Shizune is only mute because she doesn't want to talk, and he forced her into classes to make her ""normal."" Jigoro is irredeemably terrible."

katawashoujo,3chuyb,Scherzo_,9,Wed Jul 8 00:57:56 2015 UTC,"Anyone interested should read ""Summer's Clover"", it's a pseudo Miki route written by Suriko (who wrote Lilly's path) that features Suzu heavily. I thought it was really good and would recommend it.   Here's a reformatted one as well, to make it feel more like KS."
katawashoujo,3chuyb,Mrfozmoppler,4,Wed Jul 8 01:40:16 2015 UTC,"Has anyone here had the chance to read Scissorlips' Suzu route AND Summer's Clover? I'm curious, but a little hesitant considering they were made by different people, with probably different ideas as to where to take her character.  I know it's an inherent problem, dealing with fanfiction, but the idea of your best girl becoming an entirely different character isn't the easiest thing to deal with."
katawashoujo,3chuyb,flameleaf,9,Wed Jul 8 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"I've read both, and I suppose that my opinion can be broken down like this, with specific regard to KS fanfiction. General comments first.   They're major works, by which I mean that they occupy significant headcanon or pseudocanon space, provide fairly solid characterisation and back-story, and substantial connection to existing canon. They're pseudoroutes, in the sense that they could not have been integrated into existing KS without serious disruption. However, some caveats apply. Suriko wrote the Lilly route, and was active in the dev process. There's an unquantifiable advantage there, because that would mean some unknown level of increased compatibility with the original material. This would take the form of knowing what the characters 'really' were like during development, and possibly even what their possible relationships were. Thus, in relation to KS canon, Summer's Clover would be more compatible in some ways. Scissorlips' Suzu pseudoroute is well-written enough. It had the advantage of being the first major attempt to write this character and give her a full route. By sheer fact of existence, it's now headcanon to many KS fans. However, it's possible to imagine Suzu some other way—just very difficult because of how deeply characterised and well-drawn this Suzu is, and because it's from HER point of view. The main weakness of Scissorlips' Suzu is that she's not particularly Japanese. She's pretty much a caricature, but drawn so subtly that you don't realise it. Perhaps the best place to jump into that discussion is here. Not for nothing, however, are these two routes famous and well-liked. The writing is better than for most other fanfics, and clearly the authors put a great deal of thought into their executed visions. In fact, Suriko's is a thinner deal because it was designed as a VN route, while Scissorlips was going for a full novel, it seems."
katawashoujo,3chuyb,brythain,3,Wed Jul 8 03:40:38 2015 UTC,"I think you pretty much summed up what I was thinking better than I can write it out. It is a headcanon vs canon issue. The problem is the headcanon was developed before the canon was. There's a good reason why there aren't any fanfictions that take one of the main girls and ask ""what if they were like this, instead?"" (or, not that I know of, anyway).  And Scissorlips' version, canon or not, had a much bigger impact on me than any of the ingame routes, so that is kind of a tall order. I think I can handle seeing another interpretation. I want to, simply because it's her. It just isn't easy. I started watching Dr. Who with Christopher Eccleston, not David Tennant, and even then I'm not entirely sure which is my favorite... but this is KS we're talking about. The feels run much, much deeper.  I'm surprised you brought up the fact that she isn't really Japanese as one of the main flaws, rather than her Hollywood Narcolepsy, though. It has been a while since I last read the main routes, but from what I remember the only one that really had a Japanese vibe was Shizune's. Scissorlips' Suzu's seemed about on par with the other routes. Are any of the devs Japanese? And didn't the game only recently get a Japanese translation?  I'm gonna give it a shot. Add it to my reading list and judge it for myself. I'm sure it has plenty of merits of it's own. I just need to remember that just because her name is also Suzu, that doesn't mean this Suzu has to or should replace my Suzu. Her place in my heart is absolutely unshakable."
katawashoujo,3chuyb,flameleaf,2,Wed Jul 8 05:20:23 2015 UTC,"Cpl_Crud at least lives in Japan at the moment.  Edit: In any case, the complaints (or whatever you'd like to call them) I hear brought up most often are: her narcolepsy being shown incorrectly, Hisao seems like he's there only because he has to be there, and that the pseudo-route can be seen as trying to be too dramatic too often.  I can't speak for the verity of any of these, but they're just things I hear fairly frequently."
katawashoujo,3chuyb,TheDwarfLard,2,Wed Jul 8 05:34:39 2015 UTC,"Most of the complaints I've seen regarding it (save for the fake narcolepsy) are pretty subjective. IMO it was perfect. I think Hisao was far, far too dramatic in Rin's route, to the point where I didn't want to take him seriously as a character. The way he acts in Scissorlips' Suzu route accurately reflects what I would have done in his shoes."
katawashoujo,3chuyb,flameleaf,2,Wed Jul 8 05:53:36 2015 UTC,The way he acts in Scissorlips' Suzu route accurately reflects what I would have done in his shoes.   But that can bring up the point that none of us are Hisao.
katawashoujo,3chuyb,TheDwarfLard,2,Wed Jul 8 06:03:31 2015 UTC,"Which is also a fair point. Hisao is still a character in his own right, but he also takes on the role of the reader's POV. KS is kind of a dating sim. I'm sure I'm not the only one guilty of wanting to see the world through his eyes."
katawashoujo,3chuyb,flameleaf,2,Wed Jul 8 06:18:39 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you brought up the fact that she isn't really Japanese as one of the main flaws, rather than her Hollywood Narcolepsy, though.   Well, Hollywood anything is a caricature — perhaps that's one of the elements of this non-Japaneseness. One of the problems with many fanfic writers is that they haven't actually tried to 'get into the head' of a foreign mind. So they end up with a sort of Beverly Hills character with a Japanese face. Another related difficulty is lack of experience.  However, VNs are often caricatures themselves, using stereotypes and tropes shamelessly as a shorthand of sorts. And KS tries very hard to subvert stereotypes and tropes anyway. Suzu's story is great on its own; after I read it, I asked myself, can we give the rest of them equal depth? If so, what would the outcome be?  My personal solution can be found in 'After The Dream'. Perhaps the closest I've come to making a character have a life is with Lilly Satou, in 'Testament'. The other likely candidate is Mutou-sensei, in his own arc here. It's not easy, and the exercise made me appreciate Scissorlips' work more, whatever flaws might lurk.  Finally, Suriko's work isn't canon, technically. It's not even DLC. What it is, is something like the other route elements edited out before final release—it's a dream of something that might have happened, but didn't. Think of it as a story about a possible alternative Suzu, who really isn't your Suzu at all—nor mine. :)"
katawashoujo,3chuyb,brythain,3,Wed Jul 8 06:24:51 2015 UTC,"Without spoiling anything major in Summer's Clover, I can say that the Suzu Suriko envisioned and Scissorlips' take on the character are quite different from each other. Just the fact that she falls in love with Miki in one of Summer's Clover's paths should tell you there's at least one huge difference between the two Suzus (not that there's any way Scissorlips could have known that about her back in 2012)."

Even some lyrics ""In the forest all the trees are turning black, and soarings the only way I know how to react.""  That and the line ""give me one good reason and I'll never ask again."" North Atlantic Oscillation's rendition is my favorite cover of that Bob Mould song.  The lyrics are very Rin-ish, but, then again like tone change in this one, a lot of NAO's stuff is."

No particular theme just music that I sometimes listen to. Hope my taste in music isn't too terrible for yall.  Dangerous reminds me of Emi. I dunno its one my favorite running songs, so maybe that's why. Plus she is dangerous and a pirate too :P.  Bruises reminds me of Misha and Shizune and Lovefool does too.  I Feel It All gives me Lilly ending vibes, but probably more of a neutral ending song than good ending.  Shizune bad ending; Nothing Better the matter of factness of the female singer/lyrics reminds me of Shizune, and the male lyrics remind me of Hisao scrambling to fix everything too.  Hmm Excuses reminds me of Hanako x Hisao; the young love/summer feeling to it I guess.  I don't have a clue for Rin. I think she would appreciate Pogo's style tho."

katawashoujo,3cdp1m,daan831,2,Tue Jul 7 08:02:32 2015 UTC,"Well, what I get from the song is that it's about a guy and he's going through something with a girl and it's really confusing for him and his thoughts are everywhere because he's confused about what he feels and whether or not it's love or the idea of love. I kind of get hints of self destructive emotions throughout the song and I dunno it reminded me of Rin and her personality. I'm probably not explaining it as well as I could but I hope that helps a little? I'm a Wilco fan too and sometimes when I listen to them it just...reminds me of Rin (or at least how I felt when I played her route)"

katawashoujo,3c9fqd,FEZCHEZ,40,Mon Jul 6 03:15:53 2015 UTC,"While I respect 4LS's decisions just like anyone else, some people seem to be confused about their legal rights.  Yes, in the Katawa Shoujo license agreement they state that you may not modify the game. This is not legally enforceable, and 4LS would be fools to try. I doubt they ever would.  We could assume that they mean to say that distributing modified copies of Katawa Shoujo is unlawful. This is certainly enforceable, and I would have no problem with them insisting on this.  However, distributing materials required to modify your own copy of KS, as long as said materials don't contain anything from KS or created by 4LS and they're wholly original - there's nothing 4LS can or should try to do about that, and personally I think it's wrong of them to try to prevent it.  You might disagree, and that's fine - but the fact of the matter is that including such a clause in their license agreement is foolish and unenforceable, except by relying on consumer goodwill.  I am not a lawyer, I cannot source what I say here, I am probably not qualified enough for this comment to be taken seriously.  Edit: I fully expect downvotes because 4LS worship. That's fine too. I love KS and I am very fond of 4LS - doesn't mean I have to agree with everything they've done, but you go ahead and do that if you want.  Second edit: See brythain's comment. The argument I made would most likely not be applicable to this mod, as the characters it includes were originally created by 4LS. My bad! Stands for other fan mods, though."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Ultra_HR,12,Mon Jul 6 13:17:51 2015 UTC,as long as said materials don't contain anything from KS or created by 4LS and they're wholly original   I do believe that the characters of Saki and Rika were created by 4LS.
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,brythain,6,Mon Jul 6 17:34:15 2015 UTC,"Well damn, you got me there.  I'll be honest, I was talking more about the whole ""KS mods are bad yo"" mentality than this mod in particular - but for sure I'll concede that my argument doesn't apply here."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Ultra_HR,2,Mon Jul 6 17:47:22 2015 UTC,"That's true, but not being part of the game, they wouldn't fall under the same license."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Atario,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"They'd fall under the more general copyright laws, which are more restrictive."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,brythain,6,Tue Jul 7 05:09:47 2015 UTC,"As I understand things, what you have said is all spot-on.  Just as a book's author can't prevent you from cutting up your copy of the book and rearranging the pages as you see fit, neither can a software publisher prevent you from taking a hex editor (or anything else) to your copy of the software.  If I'm properly understanding what these people are doing, they're giving you a specialized tool to chop up your copy of KS.  As long as said tool does not include any of KS's assets, they're pretty much scot-free.  In fact, 4LS may be misunderstanding what this is.  They may think these people are just making up a different version of KS and distributing it, including the the original game's assets (or some modified versions thereof), which would of course be in violation of the license, no question.  On the other hand, they may actually understand just fine but still object to it.  In this case, it comes down to a moral decision, not a legal one, about who is in the right, and furthermore, a question of taste as to whether you simply like what is being done or not.  And those moral and preferential questions are answerable mostly independent of one another."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Atario,2,Mon Jul 6 14:29:12 2015 UTC,"I think this still stand with Rika and Saki having been made by 4LS. They drew a single picture of each one for an April fools joke. That's literally it. They didn't copyright them, and I doubt it would matter if they had. I don't see the problem with making a free mod for a free (or paid) game, regardless of content. Very hyped for Saki route in particular."

katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Ultra_HR,2,Mon Jul 6 14:19:50 2015 UTC,"I think the people making the mod should also emphasise the fact that what they're doing isn't directly affecting the original game, and is more of fan fiction.  The main reason I believe 4LS wouldn't want people to mod KS is because they are happy with it and feel it's a completed story, kind of like how they don't want to make a sequel or any more content for it. Making this mod could change how people experience the game, into something they didn't envision which is spitting in their face, on a project they worked on for many years and then gave away for free no less. I'm not against this mod, more content is awesome, but I don't think it should be seen as part of the game.  TL;DR: 4LS don't want the game ruined for people."

So, even with the dubious legality, I still hope this--or anything--playable is released."

katawashoujo,3c9fqd,TheDwarfLard,9,Mon Jul 6 03:54:07 2015 UTC,Are they adding a self contained route or modding it into the original game?
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Joby05,15,Mon Jul 6 04:28:13 2015 UTC,"They themselves have called it a mod several times, so I'd almost definitely say it's been modded into the original game. Either way, Katawa Shoujo and its assets are more or less meant to be left alone (they might let things slide for silly little videos, but not full routes being added). People can and will disagree with 4LS' stance on this, but it's fairly disrespectful to blatantly ignore their stance."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Dannflor,13,Mon Jul 6 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"People can and will disagree with 4LS' stance on this, but it's fairly disrespectful to blatantly ignore their stance.   Agreed. I don't agree with 4LS' stance, and I know we've all debated it at length, but blatantly disregarding their wish isn't cool. To mod new routes into the original game is even more extreme than just making a stand alone route. Interesting..."

How can you replicate the experience of KS without the background assets, sprites, fonts, and music? 4LS are certainly entitled to determine how their assets are used but your statement is completely ridiculous.   Last time I checked, you don't need permission to mod a game. I don't see the issue honestly - 4LS is mostly disbanded and I doubt anyone from that studio is going to be chasing people down for mods."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Sohtak,6,Mon Jul 6 05:46:09 2015 UTC,"...what exactly is the other way of doing this?   Make it standalone product with your own resources instead of a direct modification to the game. It's not the same as replicating the experience of KS, but 4LS has explicitly stated they don't want people doing stuff of the sort. Now, you can argue about whether you think that's right or wrong, but I think people should respect their wishes either way. /u/Sohtak covered this pretty well."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Joby05,2,Mon Jul 6 06:31:36 2015 UTC,"How are they disbanded exactly? They are still here to this day would be VERY pissed off if I went and linked this ""Fan route"" on their fourms, I can guarantee you that much.

katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Parzivus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:33:58 2015 UTC,"Their view is the Katawa Shoujo was released as a completed product, save edits for mistakes and new translations (which don't impact the intended experience, just allow more people to experience it). Based on that, there's nothing that needs or should be added. Yet, with the lengths that people are going to, it almost strengthens their view to not allow any form of modding."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:45:34 2015 UTC,"Sure, no one's arguing that the game is incomplete, exactly, but it still benefits from added content in the same way that any other game does. This is no different from fanfiction, it just adds images and maybe a cutscene in addition to writing. There are plenty of games that benefit from mods; I really don't know why KS has to be an exception. It's easy to forget on this sub that KS is, in the end, just a game, and if I can play a custom mode in DotA or improve the graphics of half life, why not add more routes to this? Sure, it isn't necessarily dev-quality, but it can still be good."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Sohtak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"I really don't know why KS has to be an exception.   It's an exception because 4LS made it an exception. It's their game, so they have that final say.  As for DotA or Half-Life, are the affiliated companies okay with you doing such things? I would assume they are. That's where the difference is. Upon (or slightly before, can't remember), one of the few things 4LS asked was that KS not be modded. There's likely more to be gained from going outside the domain of Katawa Shoujo anyway."

katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Joby05,19,Mon Jul 13 14:08:16 2015 UTC,Maybe Im being disrespectful but I don't get how this is a big deal. How is it different from Skyrim or GTA or any other game that gets modded? Because 4LS is indie? They dont make any money off of it to begin with so I dont see how its hurting them in any way... theyre trying to add more to an amazing game because they enjoyed it so much and I think thats great. Just ignore it and move on if you dont like it?
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,VladimirPutinYouOn,4,Mon Jul 6 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%. I think that they should allow fans to mod their game (especially considering how many people love their game). Unfortunately, it doesn't really matter what we think. When we make our own game, we can dictate the rules of distribution/modification but until then we have to respect their wishes (or potentially face ramifications)."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,BitHorizon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:57:24 2015 UTC,"its not a big deal, but its still uncool. If someone wrote a novel and then distributed it for free and then someone made some fan fiction (regardless of how good it was!) and slipped it into some existing copies and began distributing that; then the original author asks them to not do that (for any reason, but most likely to protect the high quality of their original work) it's just impolite."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Ultra_HR,24,Mon Jul 6 18:26:19 2015 UTC,It's not being slipped into existing copies. You have to go out of your way to get it on your own volition.
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Aerowulf9,6,Mon Jul 6 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"slipped it into some existing copies and began distributing that   Nah, here's the thing - they aren't going to be distributing a modified version of Katawa Shoujo, or if they are then they're doing it wrong. They should be distributing only the materials necessary to modify your own copy of Katawa Shoujo - and there's nothing 4LS can do, legally or otherwise, to disallow that."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,VladimirPutinYouOn,4,Mon Jul 6 08:05:27 2015 UTC,"In that situation I totally see how it would be a problem, because the new content is invading and being seen as if it were the original. People can get confused. But thats not really what this is, is it? I dont know what these guys' plans are in particular but typically with a mod, you would download it seperately and add it to the game itself personally. So anyone in posession of it should know full well that its not from the original author. I dont see how its really any different any other fan fiction besides the fact that it's going to use some of the base game's code and resources as it's introduction. Is that so important for 4LS to be making such a fuss about it?"
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,ieya404,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:11:52 2015 UTC,"Well my bad... as you said yourself, people can get confused! My understanding of the situation is a bit different then; but I still think that 4LS doesn't want these mods done to their work, and while they won't do anything about it, I think the least we owe them for giving us this game is to respect their wishes. But the situation is not as bad as I first thought it was, my bad! hahaha"
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,goofyomnivore,-1,Mon Jul 6 07:25:38 2015 UTC,"Okay.  The various folk who make up 4LS spent thousands of hours of their time crafting Katawa Shoujo.  They then generously made the result of all that work free for everyone to enjoy, conditional on a licence - ""You may not alter the game, nor make your own derivative work that builds on it"".  It's pretty disrespectful to ignore that one request 4LS made in exchange for giving us the VN, don't you think?  If you really are inspired to create a VN - fantastic.  But don't use the characters, setting, or story that someone else created and explicitly asked to be left alone, if you do actually have any respect for them at all."

katawashoujo,3c9fqd,derperfetus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:47:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I see modding as viable an expression of 'fan works' as fan fiction or art. I'm just a fan tho and not a creator. I understand how having a stranger 'physically' altering your work would be unsettling even if the intentions are good. I can respect that, so I'm with 4LS on this one.  Using Saki and Rika isn't very nice too. They're characters that 4LS probably had ideas for, and if they ever wanted to re use them the quality of their future products may be lowered because of perceptions they may have ripped ideas off from a fan work. Say Saki's writer had this amazingly awesome story for her back in 2012 or whatever, and this fan work coincidentally had an eerily similar awesome story. The author would have to rewrite or be accused of biting off others work if 4LS decided to reuse Saki for another project.  But to play devil's advocate....  Is there that much a difference between a mod and a fan fiction using music and art from the game to supplement the reader's experience? Wouldn't the coding and scripting be unique to the mod? I guess introducing the characters in Act 1 would be altering the original work, but if the mod is route 2-4 it is a stand alone experience like a really souped up fan fiction. Long as its not packaged with the original game, isn't monetized, and doesn't claim to be official how would it be illegal? Wouldn't it be fair use then?  I dunno I'm not a legal expert on international digital copyright laws, so I guess I'm just ranting about stuff I have no idea about. Whatever I won't use the mod. The least I can do for 4LS is follow their minimal rules."

katawashoujo,3c9fqd,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:31:53 2015 UTC,"They stopped development because there's nothing more to be done (unless some huge bug pops up, but that's pretty unlikely at this point). The only real possibility at this point is for independent translations. Even then, there's a fair amount of guidelines set.  Look at this for the merchandise question (and others you may have). They don't want to profit from KS in any shape or form, nor do they have intentions of making merchandise (I suppose the limited edition physical copies of the art books are an exception, but the 'profit' goes to production costs)."

Second, if the existence of mods causes 4leaf to take KS down, all it will do is bring about bad blood towards the devs. They would be foolish to do such a thing, and I don't think they would."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Isturma,3,Mon Jul 6 08:01:49 2015 UTC,I don't think a rich man squandering a culturally and historically significant work of art is a good or robust comparison to some dudes adding their story to a game.

katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Goose_Is_Awesome,7,Mon Jul 6 10:03:20 2015 UTC,"Fuck you, no I don't.   Claiming one piece of interactive media is art while another isn't, that is a weird definition. There are people who deny it's art, and who accept that it's art.  Likewise, you don't dismiss Pollock as an artist, simply because you don't like his work.   KS has a subreddit full of people who talk about how this game has changed their lives.    I see the same for lots of video games.   Fallout? Skyrim? Yeah, no.    I've seen it. Though, it's worth noting that something doesn't have to be life changing to be art. Mona Lisa didn't change my life at all. In fact, IMO it's kind of not that great. KS changed my life, but in the grand scheme of things, it's just a VN. Just like a movie that changed my life is just a movie.  To say KS is ""special"" is ridiculous. Either VNs and interactive media are art. Or they aren't. Art=/=Life Changing. If it did, there's almost no art at all.   They're games, great games, but they don't MOVE you and CHANGE you and INSPIRE you like KS does.   So the Mona Lisa, along with tons of other classic 'art' isn't actually art, because it didn't move, change, nor inspire me. Hell, even parts of KS failed at this.  And I've certainly had other games do the same as well.   And THAT's what art is.   Glad to hear that many famous works of art aren't actually art.  Edit: And for the record, it's games that have derivative protection. Art gets bastardized to hell. Just look at all the places you see the mona lisa and stupid versions of it. Or any other famous painting.  Edit 2: This speaks nothing about my views on the mod. Which I'm conflicted about. On one hand, it's nice to see mods and derivative work. On the other, it's kind of a slap in the face to 4LS."
katawashoujo,3c9fqd,Elaphoil,5,Mon Jul 6 10:13:16 2015 UTC,Here is the great thing about art that is always infuriating: art is self-defining. You don't have the final say about how you go about classifying it because no one does. Art just does.

This is strange getting one of these in on time. Usually mine aren't submitted until Tuesday morning lol. Have a good day yall.  Prompt 1  Yuuko scanned the empty tables of the Shanghai. For a Sunday it was pretty quiet: just old Mr and Mrs Itanaka and a couple kids from Yamaku winding down before classes tomorrow. She looked towards the booth at the far end to catch a glimpse of scruffy brown hair. Hisao must have been waiting there for an hour at least. The 3rd cup of coffee she brought sat idly by as Hisao stared out the window. The sound of the bell ringing snapped Yuuko back to attention as she attempted to steel her nerves to serve the incoming guest(s).  The Shanghai is nearly empty today, but it feels like Tokyo compared to the hospital. There’s an older couple sitting at the bar that I’ve seen here before. The man is a flirt always trying his luck with the school girls and young women. His wife, Mrs. Itanaka works at the Yamaku cafeteria, and she is quick to restrain him and apologize to his victims especially the ones from Yamaku for his antics. Yuuko appears to be enjoying the slow day. I imagine with her workload days like today are mini vacations.  I’m not particular to window booths, but the view at the hospital was cement, air conditioning units, and the rare bird. It’s nice to see people, cars, and trees again. The weather is fantastic too; a warm summer sun shining through the glass accompanied by a bright blue sky with the occasional cloud. I couldn’t have asked for a better day to get discharged. I wonder when they’ll get here, but I did spring the news on them. I wasn’t even aware I was getting discharged until this morning.  “Hisao are you okay, and your coffee too? It’s getting cold I imagine. If I didn’t prepare it correctly I can get you another cup.”  “No, I’m okay and the coffee is fine too. I was just enjoying the view outside. The view I had at the hospital was terrible.”  “Oh, of course how foolish of me to forget you were in the hospital I’m so sorry. I hope you’re feeling well too.”  “It’s fine Yuuko, really, and thanks for your concern. I’m still a little sore and weak, but it feels good to finally get out of the hospital.”  The service bell lets out two sharp rings alerting Yuuko that a customer is at the front awaiting service. She gives a quick bow and takes her leave to the front of the café. I take a look upfront to see if I can recognize who is at the service bell, and I quickly notice a head of golden hair, but I’m one Satou sister short.  “Yo kiddo, how’s the ticker feeling?” Akira let’s out with a grin as she shouts across the café.  “Uh, hey Akira, I’m still a little sore, but I wasn’t going to stick around long enough for the doctor to change his mind. Where is Lilly?”  Akira waves Yuuko off signaling she doesn’t plan to order, so our meeting should be a short one.  “Lils is next door in the art store. She wanted me to scout ahead. Your mother can be quite fierce.”  I’ve been trying to forget that embarrassing moment. My mother was less than friendly with Lilly about how I ended up in the hospital. Lilly took a verbal beating from her, and Akira caught some collateral damage too. They were careful around my mother during my hospital stay. It isn’t right mom blamed Lilly for my act of stupidity, but the one positive out of my parent’s hostility is Lilly spent most of her time with Akira rather than worrying about me.  “Yeah, I’m sorry about my mother, but she is pretty far from Yamaku by now. My parents dropped me off over an hour ago.”  “Don’t worry about it, to tell you the truth we we’re impressed with your mother, but that doesn’t make her any less intimidating.”  Mom was warming up to them, especially Lilly, but I doubt she is ready to admit it. ‘Good on her for keeping you on top of applying for university.’ Lilly’s easiest excuse to get past my mother to visit me was for school related stuff, and the chats about our future plans were important. We decided on a university close by that was renowned for its teaching programs. The entrance exam score requirements are kind of steep, but Lilly is confident we’ll get accepted.  “I think she was warming up to you two too, but I was afraid she would run you two off to Scotland before I got out of there.”  Akira lets out a burst of laughter followed by another grin from ear to ear.  “Ha! I’d take your mother to Scotland with me if I could. She could maybe straighten out my folks, and are you ready to head out? I told Lils to call Jigoro if I’m not back in 10 minutes.”  “Yeah, I’m ready I need to pay Yuuko first. Do you have an idea where we’re going?”  “I thought we would go to this place outside town. It had a pretty nice view.”"

katawashoujo,3c85sr,unreplaced,11,Sun Jul 5 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"... I never asked for these feels.   No one asks for them (well, maybe some people do), but they always arrive full force anyway."
katawashoujo,3c85sr,TheDwarfLard,2,Sun Jul 5 20:47:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah... guess it's like any tolerance, if you avoid for something long enough it hits you just like the first time :X"
katawashoujo,3c85sr,dGuineviere,3,Sun Jul 5 22:31:56 2015 UTC,I never understood how it was difficulty for people to get only good endings until Rin's Route. And then there was this.
katawashoujo,3c85sr,Mrfozmoppler,2,Mon Jul 6 04:04:42 2015 UTC,"Emi's route is definitely heavy on the feels at the end. I did the stupid thing and spoiler, luckily I managed to save it with the next choice, but that was rough man."
katawashoujo,3c85sr,Mrfozmoppler,3,Sun Jul 5 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I did the first time, an when I asked one of my friends about the Misha choice she was just like ""DUDE YOU FUCKED UP"". Still saved it, then went back and talked to Meiko. And then I went back and turned Misha's question down for complete. No Many, many ragrets."
katawashoujo,3c85sr,Dannflor,4,Sun Jul 5 22:33:00 2015 UTC,"You're a braver man than I, I avoid the bad endings like the plague. Fuck completion, man."
katawashoujo,3c85sr,dGuineviere,3,Sun Jul 5 23:19:54 2015 UTC,"Gotta soldier through it sometimes, man. I actually got Hanako's when I did the rest of hers, but I had to puss out and quit before I got more than a few lines into it.  I think I might still be in shock from the ending of Arkham Knight, though, and it's kept me from being fully impacted by Emi's bad end. Then again, her's was a hell of a lot more civil than the little bit of Hanako's I read, so..."
katawashoujo,3c85sr,EchoFrost,3,Sun Jul 5 23:54:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah... Same here. I was lucky enough to get all the good endings on my first go through of all the routes, but I can't bring myself to try any of the neutral or bad endings yet... I'm currently replaying Hanako's route and will probably just go for the good ending again. Maybe one day I'll do other endings, but I just wouldn't be able to handle it right now."
katawashoujo,3c85sr,Mrfozmoppler,3,Mon Jul 6 00:32:43 2015 UTC,Same. I'll never reach 100% after Emi and Shizune's bad endings. I won't risk seeing any others.

Also that little slide (I've been out of music class for a while) in Cloudland Swing (5:08-ish) always makes me shiver a little. Shout out to the composers they're wizards probably"

It should be located in the same folder as your saves.  That file tracks all of your unlocks -- from overall progress of game experienced to all the images and intro videos. Save files, more or less, only track what decisions you have made and what text entry it is currently showing from the time you clicked to start a new game."

Sadly, this requires WiFi and a fair bit of setup, although it isn't super hard. The Android version has significant modifications that allow the game to run. Alternatively, a cheap laptop or windows tablet, which can run as low as about a hundred bucks, can play all kinds of visual novels. Considering getting one myself for this purpose to play Grisaia on the go."

katawashoujo,3c0e33,MaybeNickCage,8,Fri Jul 3 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"So, unlike last week were I didn't have a whole lot to say, this week I have a ton to talk about. I finished my summer class this Monday which is great so I have more time to do other things like D&D and video games.  With my time off I have been playing a ton of Terraria. 1.3 came out a few days ago and it is super fun already even thou I haven't gotten into the new late game stuff. So far I have two worlds, one single player and one multiplayer. For my single player world I have Demonite armor and tools and have just kill Skeletron. For the multiplayer game, I have been playing with two of the guys over at the live Katawa Shoujo chat, which has been just as fun as well. We're at copper level gear because we just started yesterday but there is just something about playing with multiple people that makes this kind of game a lot more interesting.   I have also been playing some more fallout new Vegas, and I'm wrapping up the Old world blues DLC. I have done dead money and lonesome road but I haven't completed Honest hearts yet. So far I'm liking OWB the best out of the 3 I have played. Dead money was a bit to hard with the radios and I didn't like how in lonesome road they force lore onto your character. But who knows, I may hate the ending to OWB, but I have gotten there yet, and I might love honest hearts, so I don't know which one is my favorite yet.   Sadly, I haven't been able to visit most of my favorite subreddits like /r/fallout because of the protest against the admins, and that has got me thinking, where will reddit go when it ends up dead? A lot of people have been saying voat.co will be the next place and there has been some other websites that have come up, but I don't really know whats going to happen or if it will even matter to small subreddits like this one, but I'm interested in hearing what you guys have to say about the protests.   And lastly, D&D. The first session is on Friday the 10th of July at 3PM MST and will most likely be short do to the fact that we are just setting up our characters and the story, so it isn't too big of a deal if you miss it. And if you are in the D&D group, be sure to give me your Skype info and your Roll20.net info, otherwise it will be hard to set this whole thing up."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,goobernuts19,2,Fri Jul 3 17:08:23 2015 UTC,I tried out 1.3 a while ago. Daaang. Those ores look good.   Tell me if you guys are playing Terraria. I might join. :D
katawashoujo,3c0e33,lespuka,2,Fri Jul 3 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"I have been playing with /u/lespuka and /u/followthepact, of you want to join, tell me your steam name and I will add you.  Edit: Got the wrong user name, sorry."

Just going to say this: The new end-game stuff is incredibly difficult, especially on expert mode. As an example, one of new bosses can hit for around 400 damage, provided it is somewhat easy to avoid.  As for Fallout stuff, I think the main reason I liked Lonesome Road was because of Ulysses voice actor."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,HazelKim,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow. Even thou Terraria is my most played game of all time (at least on steam) I have never even beaten one of the mechanical bosses. I have a lot of playing to do before I'm going to get there. And Ulysses did have a pretty awesome voice, and the look at the end look really cool too. While it isn't my favorite so far it was a lot better then dead money."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,theRose90,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"Terraria 1.3  Just sorta not really feeling it. I stayed up all night to be on for release day. Bought it soon as the page refreshing let me click the purchase button. Ran a server multiple times, still have stuff setup to do so.  It just seems mostly like packing more stuff in for sake of fans. Kinda feels bloated now and everything is triggers everywhere. Trigger for that, trigger for this, trigger where wasn't one previously. Ultra-rares that require multiple worlds to be played through to near end-game content in order to collect things.  The new difficulty sounds nice though so I might fire up my server again soon. 7 Days to Die had a nice fat update today as well though and me and my buddies haven't played that in a bit either. Decisions. Plus I'm trying to get to end-end-game stuff on WoW for my buddies and occasionally enjoy a few games of Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, back into Mount & Blade: Warband, Ark: Survival Evolved a friend lets me play sometimes is kinda interesting too, and then I still haven't played the release of Kerbal Space Program. Oh and Space Engineers just might have release of planets next week or so. sigh So much games, so little life, still not getting all the gaming satisfaction. Lol."

katawashoujo,3c0e33,lespuka,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"The Lilly ones by Fluffandcrunch. I was liking it all, it all was so sweet, but the last update (since they write it all out of order) was December last year, and it was one a chapter of one of the earlier parts of the story."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,Mindless_Enigma,5,Fri Jul 3 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"I've been doing generally nothing. With the swedish summer break being what it is (way too long) I've been just gaming with friends, both IRL and people from the IRC. I've also been finishing off animes and a couple routes on GnK. After the one I'm doing right now, I only have one left."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,lespuka,3,Fri Jul 3 17:22:08 2015 UTC,GnK is such a great game. Which routes have you completed so far?
katawashoujo,3c0e33,Mindless_Enigma,3,Fri Jul 3 19:59:42 2015 UTC,"Sachi, Makina and Yumiko. Currently working on Amane."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,HazelKim,3,Fri Jul 3 21:14:57 2015 UTC,Sachi was my first route and my favorite character. Amane's route was by far my favorite. I think the story of angelic howl would make an awesome standalone vn.
katawashoujo,3c0e33,Murloo,2,Fri Jul 3 21:51:06 2015 UTC,"Sachi was also my first, and definitely, so far, my favorite character. Makina had the best route so far, in my opinion."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,Murloo,2,Fri Jul 3 22:55:55 2015 UTC,I feel like whenever I play a vn the first character I end up with becomes my favorite. I played makina's route last and boy were those endings a way to finish the game.

katawashoujo,3c0e33,Cycl4mate,2,Fri Jul 3 17:48:19 2015 UTC,"I'm also worried about reddit. Voat is already getting a lot more traffic then normal and it might be the next big thing. Either way, as long as the community isn't split I don't mind if we are on voat or reddit or some other new website."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,Atario,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:52:50 2015 UTC,"See, I love the community here, but I am worried about much more than just this little niche. I have invested a couple years into building certain areas up, so if reddit dies, that means that I will lose a lot of ground and infrastructure."

katawashoujo,3c0e33,Mindless_Enigma,2,Fri Jul 3 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty hyped for Charlotte from P.A. Works, the same studio behind Angel Beats, which I enjoyed. They acknowledged their mistakes with Angel Beats (such as a too short episode count), so I'm hopeful that Charlotte will be even better."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,daan831,2,Fri Jul 3 18:54:21 2015 UTC,Working S3 + Charlotte + Durarara X2 HYPEEE

Thanks to Atario I did get myself worked up in time for the first thing you named! (no pun intended)  Also that's a second mention for Charlotte, it didn't really jump out in my untrained eye."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,daan831,2,Sat Jul 4 08:21:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, you burned through Working!! S1 and S2 already?  You'll be a top-class anime junkie in no time.  How did you like them, by the way?"

Anyway Working!! was very enjoyable to my surprise. The one thing I appreciate most in anime at least so far is that it can consistently and genuinely make me laugh in all of these different ways. Although good psychological/thriller stories have definitely caught my interest as well."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,superhanson2,4,Sat Jul 4 11:55:04 2015 UTC,So I recently got a 3ds and the only games I have any kind of familiarity with are pokemon and smash. What are some games you guys recommend I pick up?

katawashoujo,3c0e33,Blindweaponsfumbler,2,Fri Jul 3 21:24:52 2015 UTC,"Fire Emblem: Awakening is pretty much a must. Kid Icarus:Uprising is entertaining if you can get behind the slightly awkward controls. I personally didn't have much appeal in it, but a lot of people love Animal Crossing: New Leaf if you are into that kind of stuff."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,Blindweaponsfumbler,2,Sat Jul 4 00:01:57 2015 UTC,"Fire emblem is a must have,  any monster hunter, Any zelda game, Resident Evil Revelations is good for it's price, which is currently less then 20, and kirby is easy and kiddy, but still a good platformer."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,HazelKim,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:03:53 2015 UTC,"Agree with the Fire Emblem suggestions. Fire Emblem: Awakening is one of my favorite games. Animal Crossing: New Leaf is also a pretty fun game to mess around with. It is a good title if you like more casual, laid back games."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,Blindweaponsfumbler,3,Sat Jul 4 08:37:44 2015 UTC,"So yesterday happened.   But, apart from that I've had a good week, I got my LSAT scores back, I get a holiday today, and I started winning a month long game of diplomacy I've been playing."

katawashoujo,3c0e33,PaperAirship,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:18:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant month and typos occurred, it's actually a longer game (one turn per day with a total of 90 possible turn, though we've been trying to speed through some if the less strategic rounds).  This week I turned the tide and became a serious contender for victory, and I may have managed to do it without some of the other players noticing."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,UnknownMango,2,Fri Jul 3 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, you mean a game called ""Diplomacy"". At first I didn't know you were talking about a game an thought you have been trying to convince someone of something for the past month, lol."
katawashoujo,3c0e33,EchoFrost,2,Fri Jul 3 17:26:50 2015 UTC,"It kind of is, the game is like a really slow seven player game of Risk where you spend the time between turn trying to convince the other players to do something that will help you and/or hurt them. It's the game Shizune was born to play."

katawashoujo,3c0e33,TomokoNoKokoro,2,Fri Jul 3 22:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it takes place six months to a year after Arkham City. The combat is near perfect and the new takedowns are great too, as are some of the missions involving the batmobile."

I remember being so excited for Origins but when I got it I realised how it was just City with a new story, that along with how glitchy the game was just made it a massive disappointment (I am aware Rocksteady didn't make it).

katawashoujo,3byrxd,Sohtak,11,Fri Jul 3 06:44:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was only between the admins and the moderators. Most people who frequent the IAmA sub are familiar with Victoria Taylor and are understandably pissed that she was fired. The consensus seems to be that AMAs sucked before she came around. Of course, it's ridiculous that the /r/pics moderator was receiving death threats for re-opening his sub, but I think that goes to show that it's more than just the moderators who are upset about Victoria's removal."
katawashoujo,3byrxd,Valjean_Lafitte,2,Fri Jul 3 08:58:23 2015 UTC,"This whole thing is so incredibly stupid.  People are brigading SO HARD despite having no factual evidence or information. No one is thinking anything through and those who are not going private are being BLASTED with hatred and disgust. r/pics and r/wow notably.  Is this the best we as humans can do?  Bandwagon and threaten people for....an internet website? Does that not seem extreme to anyone else? Just me?  I get it, ""stick it to the man"" and all that stuff. But all this is doing is hurting innocent people who JUST want to come onto reddit, look at a few of their favorite sub-reddits, have a laugh and go to bed.  I know it's a vocal minority but I've seen quite a few people tonight say they wanted to come to reddit for a video or two, maybe a few pictures but ""Got dragged into the politics of an internet websites internal drama which I have no interest in""  But no one considers them."

Basically if you aren't supportive of EVERY sub-reddit going dark you are a ""Pao shill who needs to leave"" and that's the most TAME example possible  Sub-reddits that have re-opened are being relentlessly attacked and shamed being called  ""Pussies"" this and ""Sellouts"" that and ""Spineless cowards"" that.

If anything, it's the opposite. Many people agree that this is between the mods and the admins and they just want to browse like normal.  Subreddits that have come back are not being criticized. And if they are, it's by the minority. I don't know if you're sorting your comments by Controversial, but nothing near the top is negative. Look at the front page of /r/pics. Nothing there is just a black picture. Yes, there are a lot of posts about Pao and the reddit staff, but nothing like what you claimed.  The mods have no control of /r/pics coming back online. The admins overrode the mods and brought /r/pics back with no inclusion of the mod team.    To me, it looks like you're just trying to add fuel to the flames.

They had a ""Blackout"" brigade spamming black pictures to ""protest"" it going live. Since then they have banned everyone who posted those pictures.  r/videos went public for an hour but got spammed with videos simply containing the name ""Victoria"" and is back to being private again.   Subreddits that have come back are not being criticized. And if they are, it's by the minority.   r/pics got slammed, r/wow got called ""Spineless cowards"" and ""Copouts"", r/pcmasterace got into some deep turmoil after it went back to public.  Why don't you just take a look at   https://np.reddit.com/live/v6d0vi6c8veb  To me, It seems like you're just blindly attacking me because you weren't around 3 1/2 - 4 hours ago when all of this was going down.

katawashoujo,3byddm,goofyomnivore,21,Fri Jul 3 04:19:49 2015 UTC,Blacklisting this sub would do more harm to itself than anything else. A sticky post redirecting/informing people about the issues larger subreddits are tackling would be a reasonable gesture of support imo.
katawashoujo,3byddm,ReaperOxide,42,Fri Jul 3 05:04:41 2015 UTC,I support the blackout but there isn't much sense in closing down a small tight knit community temporarily.
katawashoujo,3byddm,Alt-0182,2,Fri Jul 3 04:35:31 2015 UTC,People need to get some perspective.  Would this sub going dark change anything?  Probably not. It's a small sub and other than showing reddit is going down the shitter would merely be a blip on the radar.   Would this place going dark be the end of the world? No. If you can't handle this place not being available for a day or two at the most then maybe you need to just think about that. This isn't the only place to talk about KS.
katawashoujo,3byddm,FollowThePact,12,Fri Jul 3 07:25:04 2015 UTC,"No! I want to shit post about my waifu!   Never leave us dubious.  On to the question, would it be helpful for us to blackout? Not really. Yes, there would be yet another subreddit standing up to the admins, and that's a good thing. No, this subreddit is far to small and doesn't have enough active participants for it to mean anything.   Also, there are few and far between alternatives for this community to go to if this sub does blackout. Yes, there is that thread on 4chan, and there is even official forum threads on 4LS' site, but both are far harder to use/navigate than this subreddit.  In my opinion, the negatives outweigh the positives and as such I don't believe we should participate. This subreddit and /r/anime are the two subreddits that I spend most of my time on nowadays and luckily neither have gone black yet. I would love for it to stay that way.  Also on a semi-related point. Fuck the Night's Watch I ain't taken the black now.  Edit: And it looks like /r/anime is staying out of Reddit's politics."

katawashoujo,3byddm,FollowThePact,3,Fri Jul 3 05:26:53 2015 UTC,Both Victoria and the rest of the admins are being professional enough to leak out the reasons for being fire/leaving. Really those reasons shouldn't be in public eye anyway.

Victoria or /u/chooter is basically the sole link between the admins and mods of many large subreddits. Particulary ones that host AMA's on the regular. Victoria left/got fired. Admins told no one. Many AMA's, both present and future, have now been botched with many people. AMA mods are mad because contact between mods, admins, and people who want to have AMA's is no longer existent  with Victoria gone. Lots of other subreddits, including highly popular and default subs, are now giving the finger to the admins by going private which is all but shutting the subreddit down completely."

It's really annoying that half the places I go to are private now.  I come to reddit to have a few laughs, watch a few videos, and relax. And that involves coming to r/KatawaShoujo too. I don't come here for childish drama.  Look....I get that people want to show displeasure at the decision but I don't think that gives anyone the right to block (in some cases) 2-8 million peoples access to their favorite sub-reddits because of that. It's incredibly childish.  I pray that he doesn't because he isn't around much and that could mean r/KS in private for MONTHS"
katawashoujo,3by8is,tempusers,3,Fri Jul 3 03:56:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he probably will miss this. I was using the subreddits and they all started going down. Very unpleasent."
katawashoujo,3by8is,daan831,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:00:07 2015 UTC,"Surely though you can show support for reddit moderators who have been repeatedly tried to contract administrators to no avail. Victoria's firing was just the straw that broke the camel's back. As others have said, the mods have exhausted every other option and this is the only way they have left to let the admins know they want  1.)More communication between administrators and moderators  2.)Better moderating tools which they say are in need of an update"

Some guys at the top of the latter, throwing pebbles at our heads to see what happens, to see if they can get away with throwing a bigger pebble.  Maybe just one subreddit going down isn't going to do anything. But I don't think that's important.   I think that the important part is that later on we could look back and be happy that we tried. Or be sad that we didn't. I dunno.  ...  ...  ...  That cloud over there looks like a pillow. I'm gonna take a nap."
katawashoujo,3byj3m,goofyomnivore,3,Fri Jul 3 05:35:56 2015 UTC,"Nice Rin.  But I think that something as big as the drama going on here would probably be something that stirs Rin up quite a bit or at least get her thinking about things that she would rather not think about because when she does she can never find the right words to say what she feels and that makes her frustrated and that makes expressing herself even more difficult and then it all comes spilling out just like this and she suddenly becomes so self aware that such a sudden outburst must make her seem really weird even though she's trying not to be while hoping that anyone listening can maybe understand anyway and not get upset because of her all the while trying to get the idea of the thought of how she feels about this reddit stuff across without having to invent new words in order to do so.  In other news, going over that scene so I could write that paragraph above gave me the feels again. I gotta do a Rin run now. So, I got 3/4 of a bottle of Capt. Morgan original spice rum left, should I go for Rin Bad end or Rin neutral end? I gotta be able to stop crying and pick up the pieces long enough for Splatfest mind ya."

We have NO stake in this and I will be VERY upset with the community if this place actually shuts down over something so stupid that doesn't even effect us.  You know what r/KS will achieve by shutting down? Nothing  Except alienating it's already small userbase and killing a small sub. r/KS is not a defualt sub-reddit so therefore us shutting down does nothing.  This is so stupid.

katawashoujo,3bwjud,RiotFlag,3,Fri Jul 3 03:23:03 2015 UTC,"I have yet to finish the game, but thought I'd share something anyway.  I have Crohn's Disease and it put me in the hospital for a week last year. Its been pretty tough for me. What Hisao says about his sudden condition and what it meant for him really resonated with me.   I actually found myself crying during one of the first track scenes with Emi,  because it made me reflect on my own life, which I can't say has ever happened to me before.  I am in love with Emi's route so far. She even inspired me to start running in the early morning, which has really helped with my self esteem."
katawashoujo,3bwjud,cvHanky,3,Fri Jul 3 01:18:06 2015 UTC,I'm sorry to hear that. I've been lucky enough to be a pretty healthy person overall. Mental health is my main issue.   I think you'll find Emi's route to be a great inspiration. It's a great example of perseverance. You've never failed until you've completely given up. That attitude has helped me to kick anxiety/depression's ass.
katawashoujo,3bwjud,Sohtak,3,Fri Jul 3 03:28:08 2015 UTC,"I think Emi has made 50% (take or give) of the people who played her route run in the mornings. I know I did. And the whole time, Emi was in the back of my mind telling me to never give up."
katawashoujo,3bwjud,TheDwarfLard,5,Fri Jul 3 15:25:00 2015 UTC,"Indeed, It largely reminded me of how lucky I am/are to be relatively healthy.   No arrythmia, no missing limbs or lost sight or deafness. It really makes you appreciate what you have in life.  But it's also taught me (And I would hope many others) to be a better person. That everyone has something going on so you should be the bigger person and be kind to each other. You don't know what a person is going through or has gone through and you should treat them with respect and kindness.  It's a good message to send to people these days when everyone is eager to jump at each others throats over the most minor of things that don't really matter.  To yet again quote Chaplin - ""We think too much and feel to little""  I also agree with all the neat set-pieces within KS. It's one thing that I wish was expanded upon more. I enjoyed the trips to the City with Lilly and Hanako, I enjoyed Lillys farm house in her Act 3.   I enjoyed the Atelier/Art Exhibition in Rins route, Visting Emi's house in her route, Going to Shizune's House/The lake in her route...so much fun stuff and it gives the world alot more of an...alive feel I suppose."

katawashoujo,3bnk6a,KingMoonfish,2,Tue Jun 30 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sure if I liked Rin or Hanako more. Rin's story line was pretty realistic - her attitude and emotions are believable and well written. In comparison, Hanako's bad ending feels forced - and her good ending in some ways seems worse than in Lily's route, where she appears arguably happier.   This picture, to me, really captures what Rin is, and what she represents. I only wish the route was more fleshed out - where is she from? What does she want? What about her family?   Anyway - Yay more Rin art!"

People have told me their personalities have supposedly changed when a few weeks separated times taking the tests (nothing major happened in between the two tests).  It may be something worth investigating, but I don't know if MBTI is the way to do it. Just my thought."
katawashoujo,3bpo54,TheDwarfLard,3,Wed Jul 1 03:56:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I'll do some research! Yeah, I'm sure there are plenty, more accurate personality tests out there, I figured this one was the most ""mainstream"" out of the tests and that more people had taken it. I took the test a few years ago and my type has managed to stay the same, but it just varies with different people I guess. Kinda just wanted to post this as a starting point for discussion. If you find a better test, I'd love to check it out!"
katawashoujo,3bpo54,goofyomnivore,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:00:37 2015 UTC,"SHL's OPQ32 and the Hogan Personality Inventory are considered the most 'accurate' in the business field... at least according to my human resources classes, but with that said we were taught none of them are considered very accurate or as scientific evidence in the hiring process.  I think they are fun little tests to take tho. I usually score on the introverted or idealistic side of them, and honestly that is pretty accurate for me."
katawashoujo,3bpo54,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:09:15 2015 UTC,"I've heard the Big Five is at least decent, though it still doesn't account for absolutely everything (a test that could would likely be massive). I'm not even sure a personality test could capture everything that is personality. However, that test may be a good starting point."
katawashoujo,3bpo54,Kafke,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:13:48 2015 UTC,"the Myers-Briggs test isn't the most accurate personality test out there.   It's worth noting that there's two main parts of Myers-Briggs. The first is the type indicator, this is the four letter code thingy you see all over the place. It's based a lot off Jung's work, and have been shown to correlate with actual personality traits. It isn't the most accurate (it's missing an axis), but it works. More accurate you'd want to go with Big5 (but it's a lot less popular).  The other aspect is the test itself. Almost everyone over at /r/mbti pretty much hates this thing. The 'official' test sucks ass, and most online ones are awful as well.   People have told me their personalities have supposedly changed when a few weeks separated times taking the tests (nothing major happened in between the two tests).   That's because the test sucks. Get a more reliable test, and you get a consistent result."
katawashoujo,3bpo54,goofyomnivore,2,Wed Jul 1 07:58:53 2015 UTC,ESFJ for Lilly and ENTJ for Shizune seemed like solid matches to me. I scored as a ISFP when I did this a few years ago in my human resources class. I don't think I've changed all that much.. maybe a little crankier now hah.
katawashoujo,3bpo54,brythain,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:56:12 2015 UTC,"The problem is that a) the girls aren't real people who have responded to psychometric testing (so we have no calibrated data), and b) they weren't designed to be simulations of such real people, so whatever traits they appear to have are our interpretation of their responses to a test they didn't take.  So this discussion is interesting in terms of attempting to shoehorn them into type, but less interesting in terms of advocating for specifics, since we have insufficient evidence. Worse, our main evidence is what Hisao sees, and he has a dicky ticker and issues of his own—including a chronic inability to perceive interactional cues."

I need a better place to store important things in the future…  Snatching the package and holding it close, I head out of my room and sprint past Kenji's. A familiar, but unfortunate voice calls out, ""Who's out there?"" And his many locks begin to be undone.   The only response I have time for is something simple and something he'll press me for details later. ""Not now, Kenji!""   The sound ceases. ""Whatever, man."" It sounds as his back is turned away from the door. I don't know what I did to deserve this, but I'm not going to complain. I just hope I can meet up with Hanako and that she doesn't need to wait for long.  Continuing to sprint, I finally make my way outside and I rush towards the main gate, the location we agreed to meet up at. It doesn't take long to spot her distinct hat and flowing purple hair. I call out to her and she turns around, a patient smile on her face.  ""Glad I made it in time,"" I say, catching my breath.  The parcel catches her attention. ""What's in there?""  ""A gift."" I couldn't have been more vague…  ""F-For me?"" Her curiosity is certainly piqued.  ""Of course, you can open it now if you want."" I hold out the package and she quickly takes it in her hands and carefully examines it. It's a fairly simple box, but the gift doesn't have that same quality. At least I hope it doesn't.  She opens it and her eyes shoot wide. Her mouth is slightly agape and it quivers as if she wants to say something, but is simply unable to. Finally she removes the gift and marvels at it. An assuming steel band plated with silver. In hindsight, perhaps it wasn't much, but it still seems to mean a lot to Hanako. She puts the ring on her right ring finger and extends her hand outwards.  She finally finds the words she was looking for. ""Th-thank you, Hisao."" Hanako ends her sentence with a lasting embrace. We savor every moment of it, as if we're the only two people in the world.   ""I have more planned for the day. We'll need to leave soon if we want to catch the bus."" We separate and all I see is Hanako's infectious smile, the same one that's captivated me since the first time I saw it.  She nods. ""Okay… let's go.""  We interlock our hands, making our way towards the bus stop. I think today is going to work out wonderfully...    Edit: Grammar"
katawashoujo,3bi3mr,TheDwarfLard,3,Mon Jun 29 13:58:14 2015 UTC,"Let me just say I really love your style of writing. It's hard to describe, but it's very enjoyable to read. It's a just a certain voice that comes through through that makes the writing seem genuine.   Sorry, that's really vague. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I enjoyed it. I want to know what happens next, what the rest of the day is like. Nice job. :)"
katawashoujo,3bi3mr,Dannflor,2,Mon Jun 29 22:47:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  In my own head, I had them going to a karaoke bar and having a private session or something like that. Just spending an hour or so singing songs for the other (maybe some love songs too)."
katawashoujo,3bi3mr,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:52:36 2015 UTC,That's cool. Karaoke is an interesting part of Hanako's personality I wish had been explored a little in the route. Perhaps if it had been longer. It could have made for a cool scene in the VN.
katawashoujo,3bi3mr,Dannflor,3,Mon Jun 29 22:55:43 2015 UTC,"Hey! Again, thanks as always for hosting this and coming up with these awesome prompts.  Today is the first KS related piece of writing I've done that does not involve Rin, so we'll see how this goes. This piece takes place in an alternate universe where Hisao did not give Lilly her music box during Hanako's birthday party, but put it off till later. Enjoy!  ##################      [Prompt 1]  Hisao awoke with a bright light glaring in his eyes. He shifted his head away from the glare, his hands automatically going to his eyes to rub them awake. He blinked a few times in an attempt to shock his body into lucidity. Taking stock of his surroundings, Hisao noticed the open book on his lap. He had fallen asleep in the library. After a few sleepless nights, sinking into a comfy beanbag chair with a good book had put him to sleep almost instantly. The library was nearly empty, as usual, with only the sound of Yuuko's computer whirring faintly in the background to disturbing the silence. A deep orange light streamed in through the windows, signaling the end of the day.  As if electrified, Hisao sprung to his feet with a jolt of energy, his book tunbling to the ground. Blood rushed to his head, but he didn't stop to shake it off. He half ran, half stumbled towards the main desk, his face contorted into a frown. Yuuko, hearing the commotion, looked up towards Hisao's direction, noticing his distraught look.  ""Hisao are you-"" Yuuko trailed off as Hisao came to a halt in front of her desk, his form shaking, panting heavily despite the short distance.   ""What time is it, Yuuko?"" The words were garbled, Hisao talking as if he were in a race. With a glance down at her computer screen, Yuuko confirmed the time.  ""Just past five, do you need-"" Again, Yuuko trailed off as she found herself speaking to thin air. Hisao had vanished, the dust dancing in the ray of sunlight being the only sign he was ever there. The red-headed librarian adjusted her glasses, thoroughly startled, staring at the spot Hisao had been mere moments before.    Hisao put on an extra burst of speed once he got outside, silently wishing he had kept up on the morning runs with Emi as his legs nearly gave out. His heart was beating faster than it should be, but Hisao didn't care. He slowed down a tiny bit once he entered the dorm, but only then because he didn't wish to disturb anyone. The stairs proved no obstacle and it only took him a moment to unlock his door, although he nearly dropped his keys in his haste. He opened the door and his momentum carried him to the floor. A burning sensation was taking over his chest, and his heart seemed to be a ticking out the nanoseconds. Hisao nearly teared up in frustration. The boy was kneeled over in his bedroom, clutching his chest frantically, his mop of brown hair now drenched in sweat. Desperate to regain control of the situation, Hisao closed his eyes, doing his best to relax. Hisao relaxed his muscled and focused on his breathing, meditative techniques that helped calm the body. He wasn't sure how much time had passed, but eventually the burning had been mostly alleviated and his heart rate, while still fast, seemed to be under control. Hisao sighed, relieved. He was alright, he had just pushed himself a little too hard.   Not daring to take a moment more to kneel there, Hisao lept up, nearly falling over again due to becoming light headed. After his vision had cleared, he noticed the neon red symbols on his alarm clock. His brow furrowed once again into the same frown he'd had in the library. Going to his closet, Hisao threw on a jacket, nearly tearing a hole in the fabric. Lastly, Hisao grabbed the delicately wrapped parcel on his desk and awkwardly shoved it under his jacket. Still shaking from nerves, Hisao closed his door, and dashed back out to the school grounds. At the main gate, Hisao found the taxi had arranged earlier in the day, and he left Yamaku after a quick word with the driver.    There. A flash of familiar golden yellow in the sea of people. Hisao made his way towards the familiar face. Breaking through a group of tourists, Hisao found himself surrounded by his friends. Akira and Lilly stood off to one side, luggage in nestled by their feet, while Hanako and Hideaki stood on the other, both looking as awkward as could be.  Smiles all around as everyone greeted Hisao, Lilly picking up on his presence almost immediately.   ""Hisao! I very nearly thought you had forgotten about me."" Lilly smiled teasingly. However, despite her resolute and calm manner, there was a hint of worry in her voice.   ""I got delayed."" Hisao dared not tell her that he had fallen asleep in the library. He would never live that one down. An awkward silence settled upon the group, telling Hisao that everyone had said most of their goodbyes before he had arrived. Clearing his throat, Hisao reached inside his jacket and pulled out the wrapped parcel.  ""Uh, this is for you. A present. I mean- uh, think of it as a going away present. To remember me- us- by."" Hisao took Lilly's delicate hands and placed the box into her grasp, making sure she had a firm grip before letting go.  Lilly smiled gracefully. ""I appreciate it, Hisao. Really though, I'll only be gone a week or two at most.""  ""I know. I just thought you'd appreciate having a little bit of home."" Lilly smiled again, turning her attention towards the parcel, tearing it apart at the seems. The wrapping paper fell away to reveal a small wooden box. Lilly unclasped the latch, a distinct melodic tune piercing the air, audible through the sounds of the airport. Lilly listened for a few moments, a serene, peaceful look resting upon her features. Hanako and Hideaki shuffled back and forth awkwardly, while Akira looked as cool as ever. Finally, Lilly closed the box, putting it down with her luggage.  She turned back to Hisao, this time, she responded not with words. Reaching her hands out to feel where Hisao was, she delicately wrapped her arms around him. Embracing him. Hisao returned the gesture in kind. After a few seconds, Akira cleared her throat, an amused smile on her features.   ""We really should get going, Lilly."" Akira grunted as she lifted a suitcase. Lilly stepped back from Hisao, regaining her composure and idly playing with the hem of her dress.  ""Yes, let's be off. Goodbye, Hisao! Goodbye Hanako, Hideaki!""  ""G' bye Lilly."" Hisao replied, with Hanako chiming in with him. ""Bye Akira!"" Said Hideaki, which earned him a hand raise from Akira.  With that, Lilly and Akira were swallowed by the crowd. Leaving the very mismatched trio looking rather solemn. Hisao smiled though, he'd had a victory today, one he was proud of.  ########################  There it is! Hope you enjoyed. Feedback of all types is always appreciated. And I'll be reading everyone else's and hopefully giving feedback as well."
katawashoujo,3bi3mr,Dannflor,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:36:00 2015 UTC,I really liked this it read very well. Nervous/anxious Hisao was adorable and flustered Lilly was cute too.
katawashoujo,3bi3mr,goofyomnivore,3,Tue Jun 30 08:07:49 2015 UTC,"I had a crazy Monday, so I only just now finished my prompt. I hope whomever reads the prompt enjoys it as much as I did writing it. Any and all feedback is appreciated too.  prompt 1  I spot Lilly as I turn the corner into the courtyard. The sun is glistening off of her golden hair, and her blue eyes compliment the clear blue sky perfectly. She is patiently sitting on the bench partially shaded by the nearby trees. I wave towards her, but quickly realize my greeting’s futility. Luckily no one notices my foolishness.  “Hey Lilly,” she quickly tilts her head towards the direction of my voice, and motions me to sit beside her.  “Hello Hisao, the weather is wonderful today.”  I take my place beside Lilly carefully concealing my gift from her. I sneak a quick kiss onto her cheek. Lilly quickly turns to me, and guides her soft hand and long fingers across my face and through my hair a routine I’m always happy to experience.  “The weather doesn’t look as wonderful as you do though.” Lilly let’s a quick smile escape followed by a slight pinch onto my cheek. My cheesy compliment was a success I think.   “Oww. What was that for?”  “For making me wait all day to hear your charm. Where have you been? I tried to call you several times.”   “I thought Hanako and you were going to be busy today, so I went to my room for lunch and fell asleep,” She isn’t going to be happy about my explanation for my phone being turned off, but if I don’t tell her Emi will. Lilly has been very insistent on my running, going as far to buy new running shoes for me, and especially so since my heart has become capable handling the ‘blindfold’. “My phone was off because I skipped my morning run, and I didn’t want Emi to wake me up. I guess I forgot to turn it back on.”  Lilly nudges herself into my shoulder, and places her cupped hand near my ear before whispering, “Emi called me this morning too. I told her to let you sleep, but you shouldn’t forget about your phone being off. I’m surprised you thought she would give up that easy.” She lets out a girlish giggle as she returns to her side of the bench.  “Yeah you’re right, Emi wouldn’t give up that easy, but I was too tired to care though. Exams and graduation coming up has worn me out.”  “Exams and graduation preparations have been quite taxing.”   An immediate shift in tone from Lilly and her face looks exhausted just thinking about it. She’s been as stressed as anyone with managing her class representative duties, and helping the newspaper with the braille edition of the graduation program. Her parents and sister are flying in too from Scotland. That reminds me I better show Lilly my graduation gift to her.  “Hey Lilly, I brought a graduation present for you,” I place the messily wrapped gift into her lap. She is feeling the designs of the wrapping. I’ve learned to buy wrappings that have indented or glittered designs, so she can feel the shapes on the wrappings.  “Flowers and,” Lilly is in deep thought trying to figure out what the other shape is on the wrappings. “An insect?”   “Ladybugs. Those are dots on their shells.”  “Yes, now I realize, and thank you Hisao.”  “My pleasure, I hope you like it.”  Lilly satisfied with her inspection of the gift’s wrapping, quickly tears the wrapping away, and is now left with the smooth and narrow white exterior of the box containing her gift. She delicately lifts the top of the box open revealing a handcrafted cane. She takes the cane from its box, and immediately beings to run her fingers through the grooves on the sterling silver handle.  “What metal is this, Hisao? And is this cherry?”  “Sterling silver, I thought it looked better than white gold,” I sounded quite arrogant saying that, as if I’m experienced in deciding between the two. I saved for two months to get this cane. The silver does look better and it was cheaper, but that is hardly a romantic thing to say. She also immediately picked out the cherry smell from the wood too. “And the wood is cherry.”  “Hisao, how expensive was this?”  “Lilly, you’ve always lectured me when I protested about you insisting to pay for our expensive dates. Let me spoil you for once.”  She lets out a defeated sigh, “Fine and I approve of your choice too. Sterling silver is quite elegant.” An approving nod follows before resuming her inspection of the cane.  Lilly’s hands begin to move down the shaft of the cane, and she is fast to notice the braille bordered by cherry blossom designs on the inside of the cane. Her delicate fingers begin to decipher the phrase. I requested the craftsman to inscribe in braille; ‘I look forward to whatever the future may hold -- as long as my future holds you.’ I thought that was an appropriate phrase. I didn’t want something too romantic for a graduation gift, and although we’ve decided on a university after graduation our futures are still somewhat unknown.  Lilly removes her fingers from the braille; a blush covers Lilly’s face, and I suddenly find her lips pressed against mine for a kiss that feels like forever. I hope my future holds a lot more of these moments with her."

katawashoujo,3bfg6x,TheDwarfLard,5,Sun Jun 28 19:26:13 2015 UTC,Is this art or are you actually making this game?
katawashoujo,3bfg6x,otakugrey,7,Sun Jun 28 20:30:36 2015 UTC,"It's just art, I make them in MSPaint."
katawashoujo,3bfg6x,LittleMark,5,Sun Jun 28 20:38:31 2015 UTC,Those are really cool! Are you planning to do any more? I'd love to see your take on Yuuko.
katawashoujo,3bfg6x,LittleMark,8,Sun Jun 28 21:55:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, It was a lot of fun to make these. I'll probably do another batch like this, but not for several days or a week or two or something, I kind of burned myself out doing it all day yesterday. I want to do Yuuko for sure, especially to reuse that library background, it took me foreeeverrr.  I want to do an SNES Super Katawa Shoujo set too sometime, or just some silly 8/16-bit parody spinoffs. I have a few ideas."
katawashoujo,3bfg6x,bgugi,4,Sun Jun 28 22:19:43 2015 UTC,"I hear you on the burnout... I'm a coder who could never make a claim to be an artist, but having worked with guys doing pixel art in the past, I know how much they used to agonise over every last dot. Each one ends up carrying so much info, it's insane.  I look forward to your later stuff when you're suitably rested, it sounds like it'll be good!"
katawashoujo,3bfg6x,goofyomnivore,3,Sun Jun 28 22:38:16 2015 UTC,Hmm... the gameboy supports up to 16mbit carts... the scripts are a total of about 22mbit... I have the feeling somebody could actually pull this off in a multi-cart package...

katawashoujo,3bhp0p,LowrateEthics,5,Mon Jun 29 08:47:15 2015 UTC,"First, please keep in mind that there was a similar thread here less than a day ago.  Second, I believe that you will benefit by looking through r/vnsuggest for at least a few minutes. Check several of the discussion threads there. Then if you still have questions, feel free to ask. I recommend stating specific things such as...   What kind of stories you like. Favorite genres, styles, and so on. Is there something which draws you to a story? Is there something which you almost always avoid? State whether you like any types of video games. Or if there is a form of complex gameplay which you like. There's a possibility that there is already a visual novel or a story driven video game which is similar. Looking for freeware only? If you're willing to pay for a commercial product without a demo, then how much would you pay? Do you prefer PC software? There are not as many visual novels in English on consoles or mobile devices, but there are a few hidden gems... Content ratings. State what you are looking for, and what you want to avoid. Be sure to mention what you think about gore, violent scenes, horror, fictional racism, and on-screen sex scenes. Any favorite types of art? Mention graphics or aesthetics that you enjoy. If it's difficult to describe, then name some specific examples, or link to a picture or two."

katawashoujo,3bhbnw,TbanksIV,5,Mon Jun 29 05:41:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure which atelier scene you're referring to, but I bet it was drawn by Kamifish, Rin's primary CG artist (and sprite artist).   Edit: Or are you asking who's responsible for Rin's paintings? Those were all done by Climatic.(NSFW link)"
katawashoujo,3bhbnw,Valjean_Lafitte,2,Mon Jun 29 05:50:10 2015 UTC,Climatic's twitter has some pretty cool art too
katawashoujo,3bhbnw,Ipskies,2,Mon Jun 29 08:56:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm, while we're on the topic of scene quality: I noticed that some of Shizune's art is a bit funny lookin', like spoiler. No idea if that needed tagging, but did it anyway. Most of Shizune's artwork is good, just a couple oddly done ones here and there. Anyone else think so?"
katawashoujo,3bhbnw,FlyingShisno,5,Mon Jun 29 09:31:33 2015 UTC,"Shizune's primary CG artist was Moekki, and her style... well, she's good but let's just say her style often clashed with the other artists'. While Weee, Pimmy, Kamifish, and to a lesser extent, Raide, drew most of their character art with soft lines and rounded edges, Moekki seems to favor rough lines and harder, angular edges. Nearly all of her characters have pointy chins. Seriously, if there's a character with a sharp, pointy chin in KS, odds are she drew them.   Contrast the way she drew Misha in this CG with this Misha sprite drawn by Kamifish. and you'll see what I mean. See how much rounder her head is in the second picture?  In the retrospective she wrote for KS' third anniversary, Weee griped that she'd often have to clean up Moekki's messy line work (NSFW before and after gif). It could be that the chess CG is one of the ones she didn't bother to fix."
katawashoujo,3bhbnw,Valjean_Lafitte,2,Mon Jun 29 13:07:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the info! Yeah, I had noticed the rough and angular edges, which doesn't make it look good imo. Also, I found the CG of Misha and Shizune running towards Tanabata Festival odd, mainly because it looks like Misha is throwing up a gang sign. Didn't like a lot of the color schemes Moekki used either.   I did like the CG of Shizune alone and in the Yukata though."
katawashoujo,3bhbnw,FlyingShisno,2,Mon Jun 29 22:15:04 2015 UTC,You're very welcome!
katawashoujo,3bhbnw,Valjean_Lafitte,2,Tue Jun 30 01:50:30 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, and Emi's route looks drawn by two different artists. Also, in the cinematic Emi's hair is a different color."
katawashoujo,3bhbnw,NixonsRevenge,2,Mon Jun 29 10:04:23 2015 UTC,"I think there are two reasons why Emi sometimes looks weird:   Emi originally had a much rounder face, but was redesigned at some point in the final year or two of development. It's possible that a few of the CGs, along with cinematic Emi, predate the redesign.  Moekki, Emi's sprite artist, seems to have a thing for sharp, pointy chins..."

I feel like it helped me see people for who they were instead of just jumping to assumptions at first. I'm very glad 4LS created it.   I can relate to this. I don't think KS will be something I'll ever forget, at least not fully. It changed me, even if in some small way."

Quite a few books, movies, friends, and couple loves that left me with such strong feelings but that never lasted more than maybe a few days. Katawa Shoujo and one relationship seems like they could still be so strongly tied to who I am, how I've changed, and what I want for the future that I could never give them more than a couple weeks without thinking of them no matter how much time passes."

katawashoujo,3bdt73,shadow123367,38,Sun Jun 28 07:20:52 2015 UTC,I still really wish there was a legitimate [Comfort Misha] option not [Swiggity Swooty] or [cold Hisao]
katawashoujo,3bdt73,Gayburn_Wright,6,Sun Jun 28 11:09:20 2015 UTC,"Supposedly in the Japanese dialogue the way she phrased things basically meant that she was saying she wanted to bang, and the word she used for 'comfort' implied it heavily but there wasn't a more direct way to put it in English. Hisao knew that she was trying to get with him (he says as much in both languages), and that left him in an awkward position.  Basically, he knew his girlfriend's best friend was trying to get into his pants right then. Deciding to go for it leads to [Comfort Misha], and the other option is so cold to her because he's pissed at her for trying to fuck up their relationship. I don't know that either of them could have really accepted or been happy with an actual comfort Misha."
katawashoujo,3bdt73,goodnames679,7,Sun Jun 28 14:51:49 2015 UTC,...what Japanese dialogue?
katawashoujo,3bdt73,mrthbrd,2,Sun Jun 28 15:15:04 2015 UTC,The Japanese translation.
katawashoujo,3bdt73,TheDwarfLard,10,Sun Jun 28 15:15:38 2015 UTC,"I was confused for a bit there, I thought you were saying that KS was translated to English from Japanese."
katawashoujo,3bdt73,mrthbrd,3,Sun Jun 28 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"TBH, I think it's pretty honest even in the English version what's going on beforehand. What with Misha already trying to make a move on you."
katawashoujo,3bdt73,Dannflor,3,Sun Jun 28 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"Call me captain oblivious, because I had to nope out of the option."

katawashoujo,3bdt73,Dannflor,6,Sun Jun 28 21:12:04 2015 UTC,"As I said, call me captain oblivious. I'm about as smooth as Hisao. It's a skill, really. I figured ""comfort misha"" meant ""actually comfort misha"". She seemed distraught, and comforting her seemed like the right thing to do. I didn't realize it was code.  Edit: I think it's also worth mentioning that I didn't learn my lesson about listening to Lilly until I'd gotten 2 bad endings in a row."
katawashoujo,3bdt73,Kafke,10,Sun Jun 28 21:14:48 2015 UTC,If that leads to the bad ending...

You were either drowning in angst or getting diabetes from the forced joy. There was far more angst than joy, so I don't think Grisaia is what you're looking for.   Here is a review from a KS-er on If My Heart had Wings"

It has lots of content tho I spent 50 hours + doing only three of the five routes. I read the other two online, because I tired of all the depression lol.  I haven't played If My Heart Had Wings, but everyone says its a good VN. The Human Reignition Project released a demo, but it isn't coming out till later this year. I really liked the free demo."

Try Without Within and Voices from the Sea for two free VNs that may do the trick re: smiles. They're both short, but there just aren't very many VNs that are free and long and good.  As for paid ones, Love at First Sight might fit the bill. Shan Gui is cheap, but also very short.  Also try /r/vnsuggest."
katawashoujo,3bftso,Kafke,2,Sun Jun 28 22:50:58 2015 UTC,"My experience of free VNs doesn't extend very far.  Other than Katawa Shoujo the only other free one I've touched is Everlasting Summer. Middling all round, but it is based in communist Russia which is a different spin.  For others there's;  If My Heart Had Wings. Great VA, score, art. Pretty decent writing, and has the sweet spot for combining drama and joy.  Sakura Spirit. Light ecchi, barely any story as such. Decent art. Only one choice in the entire game, and I don't even know if it makes any difference to the ending.  Go! Go! Nippon is pretty light hearted. More like a dating sim than a VN though, and extremely light on story."

katawashoujo,3bftso,xDrakeZx,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:31:10 2015 UTC,"Some_strange_circus mentioned the Lemma Soft forum. Up to half the visual novels that I read from 2005 through 2010 originated there. I used to post there often, and I still check the site every couple days. That said... I checked LSF's Completed Games section, and looked for a few that I recognized:    Summoner Sweetheart: Free fan game loosely based on League of Legends. Includes a story and RPG gameplay. Homeward was written over a few years, and reflects on the writer's experience traveling and living in several nations. The full version was released in 2012 with some adult content. An alternate version called Homeward One Story is worksafe, and only includes one route. Cafe Memoria. I watched this one progress through development. I don't expect that it will offer much in terms of story, and I don't find the art personally appealing. However, it could be amusing. RE: Prince of Nigeria: Absurd comedy about online scams. I'm not sure what the story does with its premise, but I've heard some good things about it. Icebound: Inexpensive indie game about a downbeat fantasy adventure, with an emphasis on the overall plot. Serafina's Crown: Inexpensive indie game about a fantasy nation that's in trouble. Gamertell's review had positive things to say about it, but their review implies that it's best to read the prequel Serafina's Saga first."
katawashoujo,3bftso,Sohtak,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:18:14 2015 UTC,"All good suggestions, but I would also recommend: Sepia Tears: This one will mess with your head, also funny Everlasting Summer: Very strange, but the Russian setting is interesting Stellaren: Science fiction, fairly basic in terms of plot but still good, and very well written characters."

It is not in the VN format of story telling but the story is absolutely beautiful and there is minimal gameplay with a more story focus.  It also can throw the punches of feels to your face. If you ever play it, I suggest you play it to the end in one go. Just sit down and finish it as once you join the dots the feels train will arrive. It takes about 3-4 hours depending on how long you will cry."

katawashoujo,3bftso,Sohtak,2,Sun Jun 28 22:15:02 2015 UTC,"I love his videos, I think they're entertaining and that doesn't really ruin him for me.   Question about the VN, as I've never played it. Is it choice based as KS is? Or is it just one storyline with no variances? Just curious."
katawashoujo,3bftso,fosterforest,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"There are choices but they aren't...meaningful choices if that's what you are looking for.  Like they ask you where you want to go and you can choose   Kyoto  Akihabara  Shinjuku   etc and so on  You also choose what you want to eat on certain days like   Sushi  Eating at home  Going out to eat pizza  etc and so on  The only meaningful choices are which girl you pick to go with, because that ties into the very minimal love side-story. If you go with Akira? Obviously you'll get the Akira ending and vice versa with Makoto.  I definitely recommend it if you haven't. It's a cute and fun little VN :D"
katawashoujo,3bftso,Sohtak,2,Sun Jun 28 22:34:19 2015 UTC,"Go-Go Nippon! My first trip to Japan   It's really not good, though.  I mean if you need a travel guide for Japan it's decently useful, but the characterization is paper thin and the plot is so predictable that it barely counts as development.  Even if you're sticking to just the ones on Steam, this is one of the worst VNs you could buy in terms of story.   Nekopara   Yeah, a nice enough moege. No real story or character development, but if ""cute girls in cute situations"" is what you're looking for, this one's probably alright. Great artwork.   Tokyo School Life   You run from your house with a piece of toast in your mouth because you are late for school, bump into a girl and conveniently fall with your hand on her breast, literally in the first five minutes.  Never have I ever lost my interest in anything this quickly.   If my heart had wings.   I haven't read this one but I hear it's alright."

katawashoujo,3bf3s7,TheDwarfLard,2,Sun Jun 28 17:58:15 2015 UTC,Second path on is generally more accepted with actively going for someone. All I'll say is don't go for Hanako. Going for her right after Lilly likely won't end well.

It's common to feel as if you're cheating on whichever character (Lilly, in this case) if you go for another right after, especially if they have a close friend. That mainly applies to Hanako and Lilly, since Rin and Emi are fairly separate."

katawashoujo,3bddms,Joby05,2,Sun Jun 28 04:09:49 2015 UTC,"He is 100% correct. Shizune's route is pretty epic, the rest aren't worth your time (unless you're a huge Hanako fan and willing to slosh through a REALLY rough cut f it)."
katawashoujo,3bddms,TheDwarfLard,3,Sun Jun 28 05:47:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's nearly as rough as you say it is. Yeah, it's not 100% completed, but the pre-release is an unfinished product (modified from an unfinished leaked version of KS), so it should be expected."
katawashoujo,3bddms,Joby05,2,Sun Jun 28 14:43:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, it definitely is. Granted, when I first played Shizune's route it was rough as well... I'm judging by the second most recent patch (haven't gotten the Hanako/Lilly updates). There is basically no music and 2/3 of the time you get a ""Hanako blushing sprite is missing"" and it basically just shows a background. I am sure it will get much better but for now IMO it isn't worth it unless you're curious about the endings."
katawashoujo,3bddms,TheDwarfLard,3,Sun Jun 28 14:56:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't see very many of those (most were towards the end of Act I and during Act II). In all honesty, Act I is the same, Hanako's Act II is very similar, III is incredibly short (don't think it has too much missing, if anything), and beyond that it's dramatically different, but without too many errors like that. From what someone who just went through her true Act IV and V in that, there was like one instance where an image was missing, and it wasn't earth-shattering (it was a close-up of an image you seen seconds before). The only other case was during a scene where a CG image should be implemented, but it hasn't been made (yet). I know Shizune's route has at least one like that."
katawashoujo,3bddms,Joby05,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:05:51 2015 UTC,Shizune's route had no CGs for her H-scenes. Also one of the Misha scenes is missing backgrounds. Other than that it is complete.

katawashoujo,3bddms,Joby05,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't know about the writing... the spirtes were broken, lots of typos and no music so I couldn't get through it. I guess they are doing a much needed clean-up so that's good."
katawashoujo,3bddms,Valjean_Lafitte,2,Sun Jun 28 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"All I can say is: Drizzly Night, my friend. One of the most touching Hanako scenes... and it isn't even in the final game. :)"
katawashoujo,3bddms,Joby05,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"There are tons of those in Shizune's pre-release as well. I liked how the pre-release in general seemed more ""adult"" themed. It puts it more on par with most of the other VNs I've read."
katawashoujo,3bddms,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:44:04 2015 UTC,"I think the end of Act I and Act II suffered the most from that. Both of those are either the same or very similar to canon Katawa Shoujo, so it's not exactly like there's a lot to miss out on. Act III is incredibly short, so short that you likely wouldn't have time to get annoyed with the potentially missing sprites or music. From what I remember of the true Act IV and V, the sprites/images were all there and worked fine (maybe a minor error here and there). The writing wasn't always necessarily the best, but it more than sufficed.  Yet, I've seen some examples from Shizune's pre-release route where grammar is practically foregone. It's not necessarily all like that, but people have told me that the general quality of writing is lower than what's in her official route.  Simply put, I think a bit of patience is required."
katawashoujo,3bddms,Valjean_Lafitte,2,Mon Jun 29 00:47:40 2015 UTC,"Hanako's pre-release has two routes: One that always leads to one of three bad endings, and another that branches off of Lilly's route and leads to a good ending. I haven't read much of Hanako's good ending route (I'm still on Shizune's prerelease) but the few scenes I have read have moved me to tears. Definitely worth reading, in my opinion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak8H5FQu1og"

Although, I can’t help but feel that the situation is a little backwards. “You sure you don’t want your prize?” I ask.  She replies, shyly. “I’m just proud that I won…”  I wince a little, thinking about my own failures just a minute ago; it’s also flustering me that I’m the one being given the prize… I wanted it to be for her, anyway. I know she’s comforted by dolls. Maybe I would be taking away from her victory by refusing it, though…  Decision:  A.) Accept the bear.  B.) Let Hanako keep the bear.

katawashoujo,3bbb5x,Alastiana,5,Sat Jun 27 16:07:17 2015 UTC,"That was a fairly old version of Hanako's route, one that had to result in a bad ending at first before the good/true ending was accessible.

The airport scene is cliche and somewhat predictable, but I guess some cliches (especially in the romance genre) just don't bother me. What does bother me is that she likely wouldn't have come back if Hisao hadn't had another heart attack. That in itself seems kind of cynical, because it seems to me that if she really worried for him that much she shouldn't have left to begin with. That being said, the epilogue serves the purpose of giving the reader the satisfaction of knowing that she stays in Japan after visiting him in the hospital.. I can't imagine Lilly's route without it."

It's really basic.  Converting music to VNDS wasn't immediately apparent so I didn't do that... The way the game script calls certain images is non-sensical and would make it so that I would have to play through the entire game again to fix the calling of these few images.  And then there's a few component image scenes which would be a pain in the ass to figure out how to make those work on NDS. So I gave up"

Get used to seeing the little bit of Hanako that exists in everyone around you, mother, father, closest friends, lovers.    Everyone is scared from time to time.  Everyone suffers from doubt and anxiety that they don't need to.  Everyone is a bit scared of opening up.  When you see that, about everyone in your life, even the cashier at the grocery store, the real world starts to open itself up to you.  No longer living in a selfish bubble, people start to become more understandable, more adorable even.  Everyone is in the same predicament, trying to be loved but not knowing how, and feeling scared and worried about that fact.  We should all have a little Hanako inside us. :)"

She might remind you of something you've experienced or maybe some aspect of you or someone. Then you should reach out to understand the parallel's between that and Hanako.

Not only does she not hit Hisao in the scene (despite how tsundere she is in the prerelease, she wouldn't 'beat' him), she's utterly mortified when she later learns that Hisao understood her every word."

As the Canadian delicacy spreads throughout the world, many will be tempted to try it the moment they see it available for sale, however this can lead to disastrous results (The U.K. Pub substituting tofu instead of cheese curd is stuck with me as the most grievous offense.) SO I will be providing YOU with tips from a native Canadian that will ensure that you can properly enjoy our national dish.  Where to get it?  ""So I went to McDonald's and they-"" Okay, let's stop right there. As much as I'm proud to see poutine get wide-scale recognition, the fact of the matter is Don't trust large chains. Minimizing costs and being required to distribute ingredients on a national scale means that you will be on the receiving end of low quality ingredients more often than not. A good indicator of this is if they offer more than one kind of poutine, showing their dedication to the food. As such, it is often Local restaurants and food trucks which will have the best poutine available. This is also a lead-in to the next section.  What Toppings Go On Poutine?  You've found the foodtruck with the punniest name (Poutine on the Ritz), but with a menu of only one item, there sure are a lot of different kinds. The traditional poutine is fries, gravy, and cheese curd (NOT mozzarella), however many locations try to spice things up by adding bacon, pulled pork, different sauces, and even changing the fries. A good measure is as long as it contains two of the base ingredients, it will still be considered poutine, however blatant substitution of cheese curd for no reason is unacceptable. Good judgement is still required for the crazier concoctions.  Examples:   Fries, Maple Syrup, Gravy, Cheese Curd.   Poutine. ""The True Canadian"", and the highest true poutine can ascend.  Fries, Chilli, Cheddar Cheese   Not Poutine. It's poutine's American cousin Chilli Cheese Fries. It's not your day until the Fourth.  Yam/Sweet Potato fries, Gravy, Cheese Curd   Poutine. Some people like orange fries.  Onion Rings-   No.    How To Eat Poutine  Messily."

katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Dannflor,6,Fri Jun 26 17:57:02 2015 UTC,"Depends what kind of stuff you like. Puella Magi Madoka Magica is a good one on Netflix right now with magical girls and a surprising storyline. A good highschool romance one I watched a few months back was Kimi ni Todoke. One of my favorite series is Mushishi, about this guy who investigates Mushi, sort of like spirits, in old rural Japan. It's kind of a subdued, relaxing show IMO."
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,nlourb_zdv_khuh,4,Fri Jun 26 18:09:48 2015 UTC,One of my favorite series is Mushishi   Marry me.
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Magniras,4,Fri Jun 26 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"To start?  Cowboy Bebop is one of those classics that just about everyone likes.  If you like being over the top with your action, then Outlaw Star is another good classic, or the internet was in love with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann when it came out.  My personal favorite is this slow little series called Mushi-shi.  Since I don't know what you like in TV shows we'll move to the Magical Girl series.  You can't really go wrong with Sailor Moon, but Card Captor is pretty fucking weird.  Madoka Magica is gonna get recommended, and it is worth a watch.  Just not as your cherry popper.  Romance animes/Slice of Life all turn into giant fucking harems, so if you like that kind of thing, literally just choose any of them."

katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Dannflor,3,Fri Jun 26 18:09:12 2015 UTC,"Cowboy Bebop is often recommended for beginners. It's got very ""Western"" themes (North American/European, not Cowboys like the title"") and the english dub is one of the best"
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,PaperAirship,3,Fri Jun 26 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"Alright, that's the main one I've heard of and the one I was thinking of watching anyway. Thanks!"
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Dannflor,2,Fri Jun 26 18:08:52 2015 UTC,"Oh god I misread that. I thought you meant you were going to start producing an anime, not starting to read one. Dont watch Naruto unless you enjoy long filler arcs peppered with little bits of plot."

katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Dannflor,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, im just kind of saying that because Im a salty Naruto fan and figured you already knew about it, but its actually not a terrible show, just a tad cliche and annoying with every plot arc being followed by some sort of filler. Its worth a watch to check it out but I would guess that there are a bunch of other anime that you might enjoy more."
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,OneManArmy77,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:16:07 2015 UTC,"I'm probably gonna test the waters with something like Cowboy Bebop. I'm not sure if this is something I fully want to get into or if I just want to casually watch a few animes. Who knows, it could end up being my next big hobby."
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Dannflor,2,Fri Jun 26 18:34:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on your interests. I'll name three paths and leave a suggestion for all of them, but it extends far past this.  If you want an awesome, but fun action/adventure series I highly recommend JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. It is a really amazing series that has plenty of action, laughs, and over the top everything.   If you want something a bit more serious and dark, try Cowboy Bebop. It is a fantastic show that is a classic amongst everyone. Make sure to watch the English dub though, it is actually better than the original. Code Geass and Death Note are also good gateway shows here.  If you want some pure comedy, My Love Story!! is a new one that is really funny and likable, but more of a classic example is Ouran High School Host Club, which is also really funny. I will say this is the hardest road for me to get into, but I adore those two shows.   Hope you find a good one!"
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,BlazingSakura,2,Fri Jun 26 19:55:51 2015 UTC,"Contrary to a lot of other posters, I wouldn't really recommend Madoka Magica to start off. As fantastic as it is, it ties heavily into a lot of ideas established in other magical girl shows, so if you're not already familiar with the genre it might not have as much impact. Cardcaptor Sakura is quite different but still very good, and definitely holds up despite being nearly 20 years old.  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is both amazing and very easy to get into for someone new to anime. Same goes for Cowboy Bebop, so definitely check those out if you like sci-fi.   If you're looking for a comedy, Nichijou and Daily Lives of High School Boys are both hilarious, and Gintama starts slow but becomes godly over time.   Some other good shows to check out are Spice and Wolf (fantasy/drama/economics), Welcome to the NHK (drama/black comedy), Shinsekai Yori (fantasy/horror), and Barakamon (comedy/coming of age)."
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Gore_Lily,2,Fri Jun 26 21:44:44 2015 UTC,"Well seeing as you obviously enjoyed KS. I'd recommend anything made by the studio Key.  They have some classic and amazing slice of life shows that really hit you in the feels such as Kanon 2006, Clannad and Clannad after Story and of course Little Busters. All of which have a very KS vibe. Though warning if you are an emotional person you may or may not die drowning in tissues.   All of these shows are also based of visual novels like KS."

I just watch what my girlfriend picks mostly when it comes to anime usually.  Cowboy Bebop and My Bride is a Mermaid are my two favorite so far. The former is a space western type of anime, and the latter is a romance/comedy. I liked Highschool of the Dead and Attack on Titan too."

I did start summer school though, the class it self is not too interesting but I have encountered so weird people. The first two days no one sat next to me, but on the third day this guy, who looks way too young to be in this class, sits next to me, and plays flash games all day long, which was kinda funny. He didn't show up the next day so I guess he got kicked out for not doing any work. Yesterday a new person sat next to me, and she was on her phone in the middle of class when everyone was working just yelling at the person on the other end about something, and then she hangs up and starts crying. And her boyfriend sits next to her and starts patting her and the back but he is sitting between me and her and is taking up all of my space, the people in this class are really weird.

I think it is pretty good for what it is but has some weaknesses that hurt the overall experiences quite a bit. Any oppinions on the game (please without spoilering me too much :D, I played the Semyon, Slavya, Ulyana and Alisa good endings)?"
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,LeSche,3,Fri Jun 26 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, I just got it as well. Played the neutral, Alisa, Miku, and Slavya routes. It's interesting that this one is notable not for having particularly good characters but for the setting. Reading  a game based on someone with a Russian background is really cool; its a rare genre. The girls seem a bit more of anime stereotypes, though. Theres a girl who plays guitar named miku with blue twintails. She wasn't very interesting, but holy hell her route was. Still have yet to play the others. I heard there is an extra route when you get all the good ends. Looking forward to it."
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Parzivus,2,Fri Jun 26 18:13:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the setting and the mood this game delivers are the best about it. I was very disappointed with the Slavya Route. I think she was the most interesting character, since she was not 100% stereotypical (I think) but boy her ending sucked. Alisas route wasn't great as well. Up till now the only route I enjoyed 100 percent was the Semyon route (which is what you mean with neutral end?)."
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Phoenixeye0,2,Fri Jun 26 22:44:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's OK to play once, but none of the female leads are that good. Just got to grind through the other good ends for the bonus one. I agree that the Semyon route is the best, at least so far."
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Phoenixeye0,2,Fri Jun 26 18:34:13 2015 UTC,"Finished that VN that I wrote a review about last week. Overall, it's pretty good. Would recommend. Whether or not you choose to leave the H scenes on or off is totally up to you, as they're somewhat lacking, and only even relevant to the girl's route in one route, and it's arguably the weakest. About to start The Fruit of Grisaia.  Also, I've started learning Japanese. It's surprisingly not that difficult. Not even the Kanji (which is more symbolic than actually practical anyway) is terribly hard. Hiragana is incredibly easy once you learn the basic symbols and syllables."
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Phoenixeye0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:09:56 2015 UTC,"While I did enjoy the opportunity to thoroughly get to know (most of) the girls, I still feel like it was extremely exaggerated and unnecessarily long at some points. Overall, I still loved the whole story.  I've been enjoying it thus far, and I definitely see what you mean about the vowels. I haven't gotten into the finer details, but most things have been indicative to me that katakana is the not-so-common language, generally only used for formalities and non-native words."
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Parzivus,2,Fri Jun 26 20:41:18 2015 UTC,"The story is a bit... I won't say ""juvenile"" but it lacks depth, but by no means is it bad. It's very lighthearted, and I actually enjoy it for that reason. That theme does not carry over to all of the characters though. Some of the girls' stories get kind of depressing at times, but they're still great stories. In reality, there's more like 4.5 routes. One of the routes is almost entirely the same up until the last decision point, but it's still unique enough to warrant it's own title of being called a route. I was surprised at how much detail and accuracy they put into describing the aeronautics of the gliders.  I knew that Japan enjoyed the English language, but I didn't realize how much they're beginning to adopt it. Some of the words I've been given as practice are really just English words broken up into syllables, which makes this 10x easier to grasp."
katawashoujo,3b7ncz,Phoenixeye0,2,Fri Jun 26 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try to take Japanese at my high school as a foreign language. Sounds like a lot of work, but I look forward to it."

katawashoujo,3b0nd3,Chraaze,9,Thu Jun 25 03:43:26 2015 UTC,"It's unlikely Misha would dye her pubic hair (dye can be pretty harsh), and pubic hair is often darker than other hair.  In any case, all their pubic hair are texture files which are just .jpgs, so you can change the color to whatever you'd like (and whatever style).  The styles I've used are:  Emi: racing stripe  Rin: small triangle (her CGs suggests she doesn't have much, but it seems unlikely Emi would shave her, so I gave her a little)  Hanako: Seen to be clean shaven.  Lilly: Seen to have typical blonde pubic hair.  Shizune: I gave her a heart-shaped trim.  Misha: I gave her typical dark pubic hair.  The other girls more-or-less match their head hair.  BTW: It came out in the KS forum that none of the female artists wanted to draw pubic hair; Lilly is the only girl with a male artist, so she's the only one shown with pubic hair."

So, that's like 1-2 years prior to Hisao's arrival. Iirc, Shizune was the one that told Misha to get the pink drills. And I'm assuming (along with Morlok8k) that she wouldn't have also dyed her crotch. Maybe she did, who knows."
katawashoujo,3b0nd3,LostHermit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:53:46 2015 UTC,I don't think Shizune told her; I think it was an important hairstyle change that Misha did after being rejected.

katawashoujo,3b0nd3,GenocideSolution,2,Thu Jun 25 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"Looks good!  A few suggestions regarding the issues you mentioned:  Did the texture files change formats? Sometimes shapeways can mess up and the colors come out differently, even if the hue values are the same with different formats.  Have you thought about using a subdivide/smooth command on the lets and arms for the characters? You might not be able to do it on the whole bodies without there being issues, but the limbs should have no problems. The 3D program you use should have some plugins or even built in options for that, it would work fairly well.  Other than that, looks great!"
katawashoujo,3b0nd3,thatJainaGirl,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:41:09 2015 UTC,"There seems to be color differences between texture files vs. object colors in blender, but that's probably due to me not grokking all the parameters that blender has for a color (it has diffuse, specular, shading, transparency, etc).  I might do a smoothed set for nudes; one other problem is that clothing like stockings and blouse sleeves are very close-fitting, and it might not work to smooth them both -- e.g. a girl's elbow might rip through if her arm is bent.  But for the nudes it doesn't matter.  Edit: After some tests, it looks like clothes mostly fit OK after doing subdivide smooth to both the clothes and the body, though there's something off with the blouse's right shoulder blade."

I'll star smover recommendations, but you should check them all out, I was interested in Jazz before, but playing Hanako's route definitely influence me to expand my collection.    My time to shine, by like Red Velvet I'm just gonna assume you mean Jazzy and run with that   My absolute favourite jazz track is Gerry Mulligan's version of In the Wee Small Hours I found it when I was going through my post Hanako experience, it's beautiful perfect if you like Red Velvet, if you check out any of my suggestions make it this one. It still makes me think of Hanako.****    That one is really good, the Hanako thoughts are sometimes replaced with the girl who made me feel like Hanako during her bad end, but I don't let that ruin this beautiful piece of music for me.     for a smooth sound I'd recommend Miles Davis' album Kind of Blue it's got that mellow sound particularly the flamingo sketches. (this was my first jazz album)*    Still a favourite and a bit happier.     I don't know much of him but I think John Coltrane's Blue Train sounds like exactly what you are looking for.* you may already know or at least recognise Take Five I believe it's one of the most commonly used Jazz standards. And it would do it a disservice not to mention it.* Art Tatum was a one eyed Jazz pianist and he's one of the best here's his jazzed up version of Danny Boy other good songs include ""moon glow"" and ""tiger rag"" he's got a choppier sound but similar style.  Wes Montgomery is a pretty good guitarist, I like his version of 'round Midnight a soft heavy song, good for a quit evening in a dark pool room* for a rockier sound I believe Beck as a few jazz fusion songs I rather like Cause we Ended as Lovers it has that smooth sound I think you are looking for.  Sinatra's My Way or That's Life and especially his original of In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue is a classical piece that might fit what you are looking for.* honourable mention to Lious Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, as well has Billie Holiday, her vocals are soft and sad try Strange Fruit   You might also like this response to a similar question awhile back. There may be some overlap between those suggestions and mine.   You may also find help in internet lists like this one on DigitalDreamDoor top lists will never get you everything but they are a good jumping off point. That website has tons of music lists arranged by genre and I use them whenever I'm getting into a new type of music.   Hope this helps.   I might have more if you want it, but I have work in the morning it'll have to wait."

The Cowboy Bebop soundtrack is legendary. Her work on Darker Than Black's soundtrack is also really good. Also Ghost In The Shell. Also Wolf's Rain. Her solo work too.

katawashoujo,3azdz6,Crowst,2,Wed Jun 24 23:31:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah /r/jazz is terrible for that sort of thing unfortunately. The sub is really just people posting random youtube videos for karma and linking articles about famous jazz artists. Very little discussion happens.  Unfortunately, in my experience the subgenres of jazz are ill-defined and most artists play within many of the subgenres, so it's hard to even find an artist for you to listen to. Finding individual jazz pieces will probably be best.   I think lounge music/lounge jazz is probably the subgenre that defines ""Red Velvet"" closest, but you're going to find artists in many other subgenres that sound very similar. In that regard this album by New York Jazz Lounge might be just what you're looking for. Maybe research the individual song titles in that album and you might find some more artists linked to them that you like.  I also highly recommend Chet Baker. He is one of the great jazz trumpeters/vocalists and is amazing to hear.   I could honestly go on and on. Lots of others in this thread have mentioned other artists that I think are equally as impressive as these, so definitely check those out. If you have anything else to narrow down the search that would help. Jazz is an absolutely huge genre with hundreds of really talented artists that have played various forms of jazz over the last 100 years or so.  EDIT: You might also give this album by John Coltrane a try. In general searching ""jazz ballads"" might help you find something you like as well."

I checked TVTropes' article ""Shown Their Work: Video Games,"" and confirmed that the author did research on real life birds.  Panzermadels: military vehicles are anthropomorphized as humans. The Kickstarter page promises that it will be an indie game, and that the story will emphasize comedy. I'll check occasionally to see if it gets finished and released.  I'm currently focusing on visual novels that are (or will be) released in English, and that will work on my Vita or 3DS. Just started Steins;Gate a few days ago.

katawashoujo,3apk6h,fcibarbourou,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of the thread a while ago that was along the lines of ""What ending would you get if you were hisao irl"" and honestly going through high school I acted a lot like Hanako (crazy shy, hair covered face, would sometimes just leave the room) and I've matured enough at this point where I spot those quiet people and try to be their friend. So, despite your socially awkwardness you could probably pretty easily have ended up with the hanako neutral.  (I didnt wanna necro that old thread so I sorta channeled it here. Either way, would get to the point where Hanako shows you her scars and that's about it. The atmosphere didn't really feel right for Hisao's dropping of the pants imo)"
katawashoujo,3apk6h,LostHermit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:00:50 2015 UTC,"The atmosphere didn't really feel right for Hisao's dropping of the pants imo   Yeah. I think the same. I love that path, but Hisao was a disappointment (bah was a disappointment in most of the vn).  Now regardless to being shy, I'm not shy. That's pretty common. People assume that if you aren't a extroverted/popular guy/gal you are shy, I'm not, I'm introverted and is not the same. I'm pretty the opposite of shy sometimes.  That said it's funny. I had the same kind of relationship with a pal back in highschool but instead of being ""paranoid"" anti femanon, my pal was an occultist anti-popular (popular people in highschool). Like Hisao I was ""yeah right"" to most of his bullshit but I hanged most of the time with him and lastly it was pretty interesting and why not fun I guess.  In the case of Hanako idk. I hanged with a girl that was calm and sophisticated as Lilly, and I had some contact with a girl bossy as Shizune and was kind of fine. Even I knew a girl roughly similar to Rin (strange, unconcerned, with that kind of strange mood) and I can't say I was friend of her although we shared good moments. But in the case of shy girls I simply cannot handle that, I'm too awkward there. See I'm not pretty emphatic so it's difficult for me interact with shy people (or people in general, sometimes I simply don't get the clues)."

Since I started running just before I read KS I would probably go to the track. Emi would probably take me under her wing when she sees me show up at the track. She can also be more forward, so I guess it would come down to if either of them makes a move, and who does it first."

I like all three of them for different reasons and think I could really enjoy life with any of them.  Hanako is probably the person that would mesh best with me. I enjoy staying in and reading and generally living a quiet life. When I think about it I imagine a small cabin in the dead of winter covered in snow. We would sit by the fireplace trying to keep warm huddled up in a blanket reading our respective books.  With Lilly I can imagine attending a lot of fancy gala events and generally living a classy life. We would attend a lot of classical/jazz concerts since music is something we can enjoy together. While she is a very intelligent and ambitious person, I think we would both agree to make time to slow down and enjoy the finer things in life. I think I would have very lively and interesting conversations with Lilly.  Emi is just adorable and I find myself enchanted by her personality. She also would balance out my generally laid back personality with her own bubbly one. I think she's 3rd only because I don't know that I would always be able to keep up with her active, fast-paced lifestyle. She would probably get annoyed that I just want to sit inside and watch a movie or read a book on a perfectly nice sunny day."

katawashoujo,3ape4d,PaperAirship,6,Tue Jun 23 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"The woman cleaning Rin's feet reminded her a lot of Emi. And cotton candy. Everything she said was fluffy and sweet, but if you squished it all down there wasn't really a whole lot left. This was the third time she had tried to start a conversation, and every time she ended up being disappointed with Rin's short answers. It wasn't her fault Rin didn't watch any soap operas on T.V., or care about the people in them.  ""Was that boy you came in with your boyfriend? His messy hair was really cute.""   ""Maybe. I don't know."" To be honest, Rin had just never bothered to make the distinction. Sure she and Hisao went out together and kissed, but she hated words and their often tricky definition, so never went out of her way to use words for their relationship.   ""We've never even held hands."" Rin added. Hand-holding was always an important part of most shoujo media. At least the ones Emi had shown her.  A stifled giggle at Rin's feet drew her attention away from a shelf of foreign beauty products (There were too many extra dots and lines above the letters to be plain old English), back to the conversation and woman who was now looking back at Rin, her face filled with apology rather than the laughter she had just a moment ago. She must have thought about how horrible a thing never holding hands was.  ""I'm so sor-"" She began, ready to perform the rest of the pedicure for free in return for her transgression.  ""It's alright. I don't have hands for him to hold."" Rin held out her sleeve and wiggled the limp fabric, smiling to show it was okay that the woman didn't notice earlier.  She stared at Rin's sleeve for a moment, then her face lit up once more. ""Oh, you shouldn't worry about that.  He's already sitting in the boyfriend chair, so it's pretty much official. Even without hand-holding."" Rin's efforts had succeeded in relaxing the aesthetician, who returned back to her work and began clipping and filing Rin's toenails with delicate motions that nevertheless tickled her sensitive feet.  The comment about 'The Boyfriend Chair' intrigued Rin, and she craned her neck around to the front of the salon, where Hisao was waiting on an unremarkable beige chair. It wasn't any different than any of the other chairs that had been scattered around the salon like leaves on a windy day, so what marked this particular one specifically for boyfriends?  Hisao looked up from the aged fashion magazine he had resorted to reading and caught Rin's stare, answering with a smile. Maybe it was the Boyfriend Chair because a boyfriend was in it?  ""I guess I'll have to say he is my boyfriend then. I don't want him to get kicked out of his chair.""  ""That's the spirit. I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that he can keep sitting.""  The conversation died, and only the click of nail-clippers at Rin's toes broke through the buzz of discussion among other salon patrons and their own caretakers. Only once the noise of clippers had stopped did Rin look down again at the woman who was now proudly inspecting her work.  ""Now,"" She looked up and smiled warmly, ""What colour polish do you want?""  ""What colours do you have?""    ""They look like jellybeans."" Commented Hisao as Rin wriggled her newly chromatic toes in her sandals for him. Each toenail was its own candy-colour, a mix of bright reds, oranges, pinks and purples.  ""I thought they were more like gumdrops. They're bigger and more toe-shaped."" Hisao could do nothing but nod in agreement. ""How was sitting in the boyfriend chair?""  Hisao was taken aback by Rin's statement. Maybe he had never given their relationship a definition either. He quickly caught himself however.  ""Oh, it was okay. I read a couple fashion magazines, but none of the models were really my type."" He put his arm around Rin's waist as they left the salon, and she let her head rest on his shoulder.  ""That's probably because they all had arms.""  ""I must have gotten really lucky to get a girlfriend then.""       Written in the wee hours of the morning while listening to Platinum Disco on repeat, so there isn't much going on here, and I'm not even sure how good it is"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,goofyomnivore,4,Mon Jun 22 14:20:36 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot! You did a nice job with it, and the boyfriend chair is a nice touch"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Dannflor,3,Mon Jun 22 14:47:32 2015 UTC,Short but well done and a fun read. Seriously good job.
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,2,Mon Jun 22 16:27:10 2015 UTC,"""They look like jellybeans."" Commented Hisao as Rin wriggled her newly chromatic toes in her sandals for him. Each toenail was its own candy-colour, a mix of bright reds, oranges, pinks and purples.   I thought this was perfect. The reveal after the break. Loved it. So totally Rin.  Well written and enjoyable. The one thing I like about these prompts is that it can produce something as simple as an everday conversation or a piece of drama.  Nice job, I enjoyed it. :)"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:15:33 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed it! From what I know of Rin, it seems like you captured her pretty well. I laughed a few times, so I think you did something right! :-D  I took another stab at Shizune, I think I'm started to get descent at her. :-D"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,4,Tue Jun 23 14:12:19 2015 UTC,welcomes our newest members with open arms   way to rub it in. Nicely done!
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Dannflor,3,Mon Jun 22 21:55:54 2015 UTC,"So I just read through... HILARIOUS!  Considering you had so many characters, I was impressed how well you captured them, especially Rin. I think you did a great job with her and I seriously laughed out loud like 3 times. I finished my prompt, it isn't as funny but hopefully it's ok. :-D"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:38:47 2015 UTC,It was my favorite of the Rin pieces. :-D
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Dannflor,2,Tue Jun 23 14:22:07 2015 UTC,"Wow! I loved the ending. I was thinking halfway through ""Okay, this is alright. I'm enjoying this. It's a little weird and Rin and Hisao seem a bit out of character, but it's alright.""  Then I realized why I was thinking that during the ending. Creative and enjoyable. Put a smile on my face. :)"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Dannflor,2,Tue Jun 23 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"When I saw the prompt I was wondering if anyone would do an arc like this. I think I will continue with this idea and add a ""twist"". Make sure you look out for it! :-D"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Dannflor,6,Tue Jun 23 20:45:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for bringing this back another week. This is a ton of fun to do, and it's always fun seeing what other people come up with.  Here is what I came up with for Prompt 2.  #####  [Prompt 2]  Rin sat with her head pressed up against the windows, her eyes wandering about aimlessly, absorbing the landscape rushing by. The sunlight is nice. Most people seem to think the sunlight is nice, so Rin supposed that it must be. The orb itself hung high in the sky and looked down upon the world. It seemed judgmental, but everything always seems to be judgmental. The sun is not Rin's favourite thing. Butterflies and flowers seem much more interesting and capture Rin's attention much easier. However, without the sun these things would not be, so Rin must like the sun as well.  Golden rays of dust shine down on Rin's eyelids, causing them to droop. The sunlight is making her sleepy. Rin frowned. Normal people are supposed to sleep when the sun is sleeping. Rin's frown fades. She is not a normal person, the sleepy sun is not a problem. The whole day itself feels lazy and sleepy, for too lazy to do anything else but sit in a field and count butterflies. Yet, Hisao had dragged Rin out to places she would rather not be. The boy in question sat next to her, excitedly chatting about... something. He hadn't stopped talking since the couple gotten on the bus. Rin would have thought this unusual, but she was far too sleepy to care.  Hisao's voice had faded to a buzzing drone in the back of Rin's head as the sunlight claimed her mind. Rin was just about to lose consciousness when a word from Hisao managed to break through to her.  ""... pedicures. "" Rin's eyes shot open. She peeled her face away from the window, firm marks having been made on her pale skin. She turned towards Hisao.   Hisao has an excited look in his eyes, one that is seen very rarely. Rin looks at him with a questioning gaze. Surely he understood that Rin would not be listening to his talking. She had made it clear that she was not happy when Hisao forced her away from her lovely curry dish and into the bus. Rin tried to remember what Hisao had been saying, but the only word coming to mind was the last one he had uttered. Rin examined it, and came to the conclusion that she did not know what it meant.  ""What... pedicures?"" Rin's mouth was dry, and when she opened her mouth not all of her words came out successfully. Hisao rolled his eyes. Was he mad? No, there was also a smile on his face. People confused Rin, they could have so many emotions at once and yet feel none of them.  ""Yeah... I thought it might be a nice way to relax at the end of the day. I guess I've never really done anything like it, thought we could give it a shot."" Hisao smiled. He seemed to be smiling a lot today. Rin couldn't quite figure out why.  ""Is there something wrong?"" Rin said this in her normal breathy tone, now quite awake from her near nap earlier. Hisao seemed taken aback by this question.  ""No. Why?""  ""You're smiling a lot today. I mean more than you usually smile. It's okay if you want to smile, but it's different from how you are."" Rin, satisfied with her response released the tension in her shoulders, turning back towards the window to stare at her reflection. Hisao let out a small sigh, though it didn't seem to be one of sadness or frustration.  ""Rin, today is our anniversary. I'm happy, and I think I smile more when I'm with you."" This answer did not seem to make much sense to Rin.  ""Why?"" Rin asked. Now it was Hisao's turn to frown.  ""I enjoy being around you."" A pause. ""I love you."" Rin turned back to give her full attention to Hisao. Rin and Hisao had known each other for over a year now, but Hisao had only expressed himself in such a way once or twice before. He was not prone to mushy displays of affection, and neither was Rin.  ""No... Why does it matter what day it is?""  ""Because one year ago today is the day our relationship took a step forward."" Hisao was beginning to look strangely uncomfortable. He was not used to talking about subjects such as these. Rin and Hisao, despite being acknowledged as a couple by everyone around them, never really talked about their relationship.  ""That didn't happen today. You said yourself it happened a year ago. Why does it matter?""  ""I suppose it's just a tradition people do."" Hisao shrugs. ""I guess I just wanted an excuse to spend the day with you.""   Rin smiled. This was a rare sight, and Hisao took it as a reward for his efforts. It had been a year since that day on the dandelion hilltop. Rin and Hisao did not always understand each other, in fact they rarely understood each other, and understood themselves even less. However, despite that, they loved being together, for better or for worse.  ""You don't need an excuse to spend time with me."" With that said, Rin declared the conversation over by closing her eyes and attempting to sleep the rest of the bus ride away. This time she leaned into Hisao instead of the window, hugging him in the only way she can.  #####  Welp, there it is. I'm not completely happy with it, but it was fun. Feedback is always appreciated. I'm going to be going through everyone else's entry and giving feedback as well. I'm really loving this event, so thanks again to /u/OneManArmy77 for setting this up and maintaining it.  EDIT: Rereading my entry, it seems as though I have some problems with tenses. I need to work on that."
katawashoujo,3ape4d,goofyomnivore,2,Tue Jun 23 00:23:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Means a lot. I spent a lot of time rewriting their lines. The one thing I'm always worried about most is writing them out of character. Hisao is a little easier, but Rin is especially hard."
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,4,Tue Jun 23 13:28:35 2015 UTC,"I think you did a damn fine job with it. Spot on, and its a pleasure to read. Its people like you that make creating these threads worth it."
katawashoujo,3ape4d,brythain,2,Tue Jun 23 00:06:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you so much! Means a lot.  But thanks for creating the threads in the first place, it's super cool to read what other people have created and I'm glad the community has been able to come together and do this."
katawashoujo,3ape4d,LRats,2,Tue Jun 23 01:08:34 2015 UTC,"Excellent narration/descriptions. I thought Rin's personality was spot on, and the dialogue with Hisao was well done too."
katawashoujo,3ape4d,LRats,2,Tue Jun 23 01:12:05 2015 UTC,"Pretty solid! I like how nothing happened at all and yet I felt like it told a solid story. I haven't read Rin's route, but I get a strong sense of what she will be like from reading this.  I hope I did Shizune as much justice, let me know what you think! <3"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,4,Tue Jun 23 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"I tend to write pieces a bit too long for reddit thread comments, so here's my response. :)"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,LRats,5,Tue Jun 23 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"Shizune was wondering why Misha would be taking her there. She was wondering why Liliana would want to join the Student Council. She had only just transferred into Yamaku, and  gave Shizune an odd feeling. She was the only student she didn't push into joining the council, so why would she want to? It wasn't even clear what her disability was, if she had one at all.  Suddenly Misha stopped, and Shizune was snapped out of her thoughts. [we're here], signed Misha. Misha had taken her down to the basement of the school. Liliana always preferred to spend her time there, which  she thought was shady. Misha told her she had a surprise for her as she knocked on the door. ""Come in children,"" they heard from the other side of the door.  Shizune was feeling very anxious. The two entered and Liliana was blocking the view of someone else. She did not have a good feeling about what was about to happen. [Liliana isn't the only one joining the Student Council Shicchan], Misha excitedly signed. Liliana stepped aside and revealed to Shizune who she was hiding.  There he was, but how could this be? How could he be sitting there? It was impossible, Hisao had been dead for weeks now. He had fallen off the roof of Yamaku during the festival. ""I can see you are confused child,"" explained Liliana, ""With my power, death is just an inconvenience."" Shizune didn't know what to think, her and Hisao were never that close, but she had a crush on him since he came to Yamaku. She blamed herself for his death. 'If only I had told him maybe he would never have gone to the roof,' she thought.   Her mind was racing, even though only seconds had passed she felt like she was standing there for an eternity. Misha was trying to tell her something, but she ignored her. She still didn't understand how this was possible, how could he be standing there. Before she could react, everything started to fade away. Misha seemed distant, it was like she was looking at her from an airplane going higher and higher.  Then suddenly, pain. Her mind was ready to explode, and it felt like her body was being ripped apart. There was no longer a world, only nothing. She was being forced through this nothing body and mind. Thinking was no longer possible, but after a second it was over.  When she regained her senses she realized she was no longer in Yamaku Academy. She looked left and right, up and down. No matter where she looked all she saw was city. This city was spread out as far as the eye can see, buildings for miles. She had no idea what happened. There was a sign a few feet away. The sign pointed down one of the streets. It said Azorius Senate."

Planeswalkers have the ability to travel to different planes of existence. The Azorius Senate is a guild in the plane of Ravnica, the entire plane is literally a city.

katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,3,Tue Jun 23 12:57:40 2015 UTC,"Misha: [Shichan, can you believe it? Hanachan of all people is joining!]  Shizune: [Why is she joining all of the sudden? Doesn't she usually read in the library and play chess with Hisao and Lilly?]  Misha: [Who knows? But we finally have a third person!]  Shizune: [She doesn't seem like the type of person who likes this type of busy work.]  Misha: [How do you know? She could be trying new things!]  Shizune: [It just seems kind of fishy. Why all of a sudden reach out to do this? I bet Lilly is behind this...]  Misha: [How can you think that Shichan? Do you really think Lichan would make elaborate plans like that?]  Shizune: [Just think about for a second Misha, the entire time we've known her, she just follows Lilly around, read, and secludes herself. This is probably some joke by a classmate. Either that or Lilly's up to something.]   Misha: [If Lichan was that manipulative, don't you think she would account for your suspicion. Don't you think she would know Hanako would make us question her?""  Shizune: [I guess....]  Misha: [Plus what do we have that Lichan needs to know so badly?]  Shizune: [Well....what if word got out about what happened last night.]  Misha blushes.  Misha: [Oh please, the noises we were making weren't that loud....}  Shizune: [Your noises to be specific...]  Misha: [Who cares if word got out? Lichan and Hanachan wouldn't care. Maybe Hanachan wants to join in....]  Shizune: [No...she's not into women like that is she?]  Misha: [She does spend a lot of time with Lichan...]  Shizune: [But she also spends lots of time with Hisao.]  Misha: [Maybe she's into both of them. It could be a three-]  Shizune: [Alright. Alright. What time is it?]  Misha: [About six why?]  Shizune: [Let's go to ShangHai. We can get you a parfait.]  Misha: [And after...]  Misha gives Shizune a dirty look. She returns it with a smirk. She knows what Misha wants. Shizune pecks Misha on the cheek as they hold hands down the hall. No longer are they ashamed. No longer are they in denial about how they feel.  The next day:  Misha came in a little earlier than usual. She didn't actually spend the night with Shizune as she wanted to focus on her studies. She was on the edge of failing, and decided it was time to be responsible. She say Hisao and Hanako there, as they are usually early. Misha didn't recall the last time she saw them separated. It seemed as though Hanako was always with Hisao when she wasn't with Lilly.  Hisao was doing some last minute homework, while Hanako was reading like she usually does. Misha hesitated to bring up her application as she wasn't sure if Hanako would want it brought up in front of her friend. Misha decided not to draw too much attention when around Hanako, so she went up and nudged Hanako.  Misha: ""Hey, did you send in an application to the student council Hanachan?""  Hanako: ""Y-yes. I-I just thought you might need some help. I heard y-you guys were always b-busy.""  Hisao: ""Wow, wow, wait. Hanako...really? Out of all the clubs....your choosing that one??""  Misha: ""Stop trying to drive away new members Hichan! Just cause you don't want to join doesn't mean you have to prevent other people from joining.""  Hisao: ""Hanako, why Shizune's club. And why that club and not my science club? It's just me and Mutou. We need new people and you know it.""  Hanako: ""Lilly t-told me to get out and do new things...and to experiment and be open or s-something.....I guess I'd start by doing student council...""  Hisao: ""If you want to be open, then join us! We need as many people as possible. Plus you'll be friends with like half the members.""  Hanako: ""B-but Lilly said to do things I wouldn't usually d-do....or something L-like that....""  Misha: ""So Lichan was behind this? Why does she want Hanachan in the student council?"""
katawashoujo,3ape4d,goofyomnivore,3,Tue Jun 23 19:18:30 2015 UTC,Shichan knows best! I liked what you did with it.
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,2,Tue Jun 23 14:32:35 2015 UTC,"Not bad... Hopefully you won't mind some constructive criticism.  I don't think Misha would call them Hanachan or Lichan, lol. She also seemed a bit too serious; usually she is pretty oblivious and lighthearted. Also, not sure how I feel about the whole Shizune and Misha relationship element, I guess it distracted me and didn't serve much of a point except to exist. Also, I think it ended at a weird place, like nothing really resolved and we don't really have a conclusion.  Overall though, pretty good. I think you should try to extend it out another 10 lines or so and add a conclusive ending."
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"I highly enjoyed this prompt. I thought it was very creative and interesting. I didn't really expect Misha!Shizune, I thought it worked out okay but I'm not really sure what the purpose of it being in there was.  I thought a few of the characters were slightly out of character. I think you did a good job with Shizune, but Misha seemed a tad less Misha ish, and missing some significant ""Wahahahs!"".  Aside from that, I found it an enjoyable read. Nice job. :)"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Dannflor,2,Mon Jun 22 19:03:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I tried to make Misha somewhat more believable while still making her a positive person. Also, wasn't the reason Misha was so bubbly was because she was suppressing her emotions? Here she doesn't have to suppress, so she's not as bubbly."
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,3,Tue Jun 23 01:33:57 2015 UTC,"Prompt 1  S: [Where are we going?!]  M: [We've got to go tell Hisao that we've finally gotten a legitimate application to the Student Council! He will be so excited!]  Shizune looks slightly annoyed.  S: [Well, this is the first time we've gotten an application from an actual student. I wish our classmates would appreciate our effort and not waste time with applications from their favorite anime characters. Sometimes I wonder why we bother helping out at all.]  M: ""HIIICHHHAAAANN!""  Hisao turns around startled.  H: ""Misha! Don't scare me like that!!""  Misha looks blankly at Hisao.  M: ""But we have exciting news! There is a new student council application!""  H: ""Oh! Is it Asuka Soryu?! You know that I win a free lunch from Shizune if a character from Evangelion comes up before the next Goku!""  Hisao laughs to himself as Shizune gives him a menacing glance.  H: ""Hey, it isn't my fault! You're the one who wanted to bet on it. Now where do I want to go for my free lunch...""  S: [That's not it, IDIOT! Sometimes I wonder why I even bother talking to you.]  H; ""Well, if that's the case I guess you don't need me helping out the Student Council anymore."" Hisao says as he starts to walk away.  M: ""Wait Hicchan! Don't you want to know what I wanted to tell you?""  Hisao turns around with a curious look on his face.  H: ""Ok, I suppose I'm curious. What is it?""  Before Misha can say anything, Shizune starts signing wildly.  S: [Well, there was a character from Evangelion in the applications, but it wasn't Asuka so unfortunately you don't get a free lunch.]   Misha has a confused look on her face.  M: ""But Shicchan...""  Shizune flashes her an evil look and Misha stops suddenly.  S: [Misha was going to award you a free lunch but I win on a technicality, so we will have to split lunch today.]  H: ""But...""  S: [No buts! As Student Council President I am allowed to make final rulings. I'm hungry, it's time to get lunch! You two meet me in front of the school; I have one more thing to grab from the student council room before we go.]  Shizune walks back to the student council room and looks over the application one more time.  She takes out a rubber stamp with the word ""REJECTED"" on it.  She wets it in a nearby ink pad, stamps it, then files it in a drawer.  She smiles a devilish smile as she walks towards Hisao and Misha.    I had originally planned to name her but I decided this worked a little better. You guys can guess who it was and why Shizune had her change of heart.  Hope you enjoy!"
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,3,Tue Jun 23 14:17:06 2015 UTC,I liked it and you nailed Hisao and Shizune's banter. The only odd thing I noticed was this line read weird to me   Now where do I want to do for my free lunch...
katawashoujo,3ape4d,goofyomnivore,3,Tue Jun 23 00:18:52 2015 UTC,Where do I want to GO for my free lunch... typo too OP.
katawashoujo,3ape4d,Joby05,3,Tue Jun 23 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"Heh, nicely done. Figured that you would opt for shizune there"

katawashoujo,3ape4d,Dannflor,2,Tue Jun 23 15:19:48 2015 UTC,I like it! Although I admit I'm having a hard time figure out who she is.  The scene worked well however and I think you got the dialogue down well. Enjoyed it. :)
katawashoujo,3ape4d,brythain,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:26:05 2015 UTC,I think the neat part is SHE can be anyone. I always liked authors who left a little bit of mystery in their writing. :-D
katawashoujo,3apwkr,Ozymil,3,Mon Jun 22 15:26:47 2015 UTC,"I liked them both, Loose Leaf in particular. The pillow talk between Hisao and Hanako was my favorite part. I hope you write some more and keep knocking off the ""rust""."
katawashoujo,3apwkr,goofyomnivore,3,Mon Jun 22 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm... since I really rarely read FFs centered around Rin, I'll mostly talk about Loose Leaf. First of all, even tho I never saw Hanako wanting to pursue theater, I must say you made it work and gave a nice feeling to it. Since she is in college I suppose she would grow more independent and, of course, overcome partially her fears. I think that in the interview, a stutter or two could've been nice, but I like it regardless. One thing I don't understand or/and would've liked to know, is when and why Hisao and Hana had a fight and when they reconciled? It doesn't make the FF worse, but I think it could've helped the transition into the bed-scene. Overall, I liked it! Short, effective and with a meaningful story for how much you could've elaborated in an oneshot. So yeah, I hope I didn't come off as too grumpy, 'cause most of these are just nit-picks. I hope to see the Hanako and Hisao story develop more, it has an unique feeling to it, since I haven't read stories similar to this one yet. Cheers and keep on writing!"
katawashoujo,3apwkr,MasterlessAshenMyles,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:51:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! So the way I had written it was that the moment in time that the story takes place is after college, and it was during college that I specified the fight to have taken place. Tea drinking has been a ritual for Hanako for at least a couple years now, so she's well past the fight they had. I just wanted to use that as part of the way that I showed Hanako had stressed out.   I'll check over it again to see if there's a way to make that clearer to the reader."
katawashoujo,3apwkr,Dannflor,2,Tue Jun 23 02:41:05 2015 UTC,"I liked the Rin one a lot. It was an interesting angle I'd never though of before, and it was cool to see.  She also definitely feels older, as though she has grown as a person but there are still hints of her usual breathy ""weirdness"" there. Well written. :)"
katawashoujo,3aophv,Raithfyre,6,Mon Jun 22 06:44:53 2015 UTC,"Wow looks really good,  and I love the concept.

Great job on the game so far! Really looking forward to the full release. Kinda surreal to think a fan made game (Katawa Shoujo) can inspire you to follow your own aspirations. It's quite a winding rabbit hole to go down and one that I'd wager 4LS never saw materializing.  Best of luck to you and the rest of the team on the project!"

katawashoujo,3aophv,Darkon-Kriv,2,Mon Jun 22 14:00:50 2015 UTC,I played the demo for about 3-4 hours. It is fantastic so far especially the music. However in the settings my music slider doesn't seem to work. It stays the same volume from 1-100 and shuts off at 0. I had to adjust it with the windows sound slider. The sound effects slider is working fine tho.  Some demo story moments that stuck out to me.  spoiler

However, don't do it just because you feel sorry for her, or that you fear hurting her. Do it because you're friends, and friends need each other in order to become more human.  It's this last bit that will develop your understanding of human emotions, human time, human space and human qualities. And if it doesn't work out, provided you've both been honest, you will both still be better people for it.  That's why we have friends, and that's how we learn to love.

The fact that you care enough about her feelings and situation to hesitate means that you are probably a good person. She likes you, a lot evidently. I say take her out on a date and see how it goes. Id rather my life be populated by well intentioned mistakes rather than what ifs, so get out there and see how you like it"
katawashoujo,3anorp,OneManArmy77,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:32:22 2015 UTC,"So you're basically the male version of Lilly?  I say go for it because you'll never know what could've happened if you didn't. If you do go down this route, communicate: tell her that she's your first, tell her about your emotions, tell her what you told us. Don't change yourself, a lot of people tend change into a completely different person when they get into a relationship remember that she likes you for who you are now.  I had this same problem last year, sadly she became less and less supportive of this and broke up with me later on. We're still pretty good friends today so even if it doesn't work out remember you can still be good friends.   Finally this is a growing experience, you'll learn a lot about both your partner and yourself. For example: I learned I was a still a bit insecure and unsure about the long term, and so I worked on those things.  If you can't decide you can always just use the coin rule: flip a coin and you'll figure out based on your reaction of the outcome what you truly want."

You seem nice enough, and she's attracted to you.  So fucking go for it. As you said you have a year left man in school and you may leave, you'll forever regret not taking this chance.  Be yourself, and be happy. If it doesn't work it then so be it. But pondering on what could have happened will fuck you up. Take it from personal experience."
katawashoujo,3anorp,FollowThePact,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:20:23 2015 UTC,"From my own experiences: If the love is sincere from both sides the relationship will be a positive experience for both of you regardless of the outcome. If she is interested in you out of desperation, or you in her out of pity it will be a painful experience.  About possibly moving: My best friend has been dating his girlfriend for nearly two years now primarily over Skype. They met at my university, and long story short her mother became ill so she had to move back home to Washington. My friend was accepted into a prestigious medical school, so following her wasn't possible. The internet and the tools it possess are incredible, and I wouldn't let moving stop you, but let her know your situation. No one enjoys getting Lilly'd.  Good luck with whatever you choose to do."

Don't get too attached because what Ks doesn't show is separation is the end of all relationships, whether it be break up, betrayal(cheating), career, divorce or death. All relationships end eventually, you should keep that in your mind, but still enjoy your time with her. Least that's what I'd do."

Haven't played 1.3 yet, and it doesn't seem like 1.2 would've been relevant to me (don't speak/read Spanish), but I'm curious to see the game in Japanese for sure, as well as it being the final version, just getting that for the sake of it.  I didn't notice any major changes to the dialogue between 1.0 and 1.1, just some grammar and typos corrected. The biggest noticeable difference was the updated version of Red Velvet, which was wonderful."
katawashoujo,3ajw6b,EzioSC5,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:57:41 2015 UTC,"Even though it supposedly takes place in Japan, I just can't imagine KS in Japanese for some reason."

Pretty sure I didn't update this PC but I might have had 1.2 on my laptop that I used to do the last two routes I went down (Lilly Neutral and Rin Good).  So, I just put 1.1. I need to see what the other Red Velvet was like now...."
katawashoujo,3ajw6b,wheatleyisamoron,2,Sun Jun 21 20:29:36 2015 UTC,"1.1 was mine. I still have it on Mac, and remember the debacle last year with a missing picture on Iwanako's letter in the 1.2 release, and uploading the 1.1 version for those who had issues."
katawashoujo,3ajw6b,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:27:07 2015 UTC,"I'd like to know what dialogue changed in between the releases, I dunno if there's a record of that out there.  I see this mentioned most prominently in the version 1.1 update notes, and it is hinted in 1.2 as well. Has anyone noticed any dialogue changes in the newer versions? I care mostly for nostalgic reasons.  Also mentioned in the 1.1 update post, the new version of Red Velvet. I'd be interesting in hearing the difference."
katawashoujo,3aidht,Xilirite,3,Sat Jun 20 13:56:08 2015 UTC,"Raindrops and Puddles  The rain begins to let up, and the wind dies down. The deafening torrent of rain becomes a soft pattering once again. As the clouds begin to part, dazzling sunlight bounces off of small puddles on the path, and the ground lights up in a glow of tiny rainbows and glistening stone. Without the looming threat of the rainstorm above my head, I feel secure in closing the umbrella up and handing it back to Rin. Wordlessly, she takes the umbrella, as rain continues to drip from her hair and the tip of her nose.  As Rin’s odd nature begins to fade from my mind, my thoughts drift to Hanako. Is she angry at me? Or angry at herself? Knowing her, it’s likely the latter. Next time I meet her, I’ll have to apologize – it was a bad idea to bring the topic up. She’s likely just as uncertain about the future as I am, and pressuring her isn’t going to make her life any easier. I need to be supporting her, not clashing with her.  But even saying that, I’m still scared. If she decides that she’d rather travel than go to university with me, my plans for the future will fall apart. I’ve been thinking of her every step of the way, but I have no way of knowing if she’s been doing the same. Am I temporary to her? Or just secondary?  I notice Rin is staring at me now. I meet her gaze for a moment, but I can’t keep it for long. Her eyes give no hints as to how she’s feeling, and it makes them feel impersonal, cold, and intimidating. “What do you want?” I ask, more aggressively than I should have.  She doesn’t respond right away, simply continuing to stare. I don’t know why I continue to expect immediate response from her, but nonetheless I’m still put off by her long pauses and awkward silences. When she finally does respond, I’ve nearly forgotten what I asked in the first place.  “You’re not normal,” she says. “You’re different.”  Look who’s talking. I shoot her a look that’s meant to be a bit nasty, but has no effect on her. “I’m pretty sure I’m a mostly normal person.”  She shakes her head. “I don’t think so. Today, you’re not Hisao. You’re sad. Or angry.” She frowns. “Or both. Is there a word for that?”  “I have no idea. What do you mean I’m sad?”  She doesn’t answer, looking off towards town instead. “There should be a word for that.”  “Rin!” I’m getting impatient. Maybe I am angry.  “Yes?”  I try my hardest not to sigh again. “You think I’m sad?”  “No. I think today you are. Is it because toilet girl isn’t with you?”  I purse my lips. “No.” I cough. “Kind of. I’m looking for her.”  She grins. “Maybe you should check the toilet.”  “Why would she be there?”  She shrugs. “It’s a mystery.”  This time, my exasperation gets the better of me, and I sigh loudly. “Rin, you’re not helping.”  She looks at me, offended, but doesn’t say anything. Something about the silence longs to be broken, and I start searching for something to say. I decide that Rin probably isn’t likely to talk to anybody else about anything I tell her, so there’s no harm in venting.  “I’m only angry at myself. I said something I shouldn’t have yesterday, and I can’t find Hanako to make things right with her. And now I’m worried for her.” Rin nods slowly, but doesn’t interrupt. My tongue feels heavy, but I don’t want to stop. Voicing the problem is hard, but it makes things feel… better. “She might blame herself for something I did wrong, but she might also blame me. And I don’t know which one is worse.” I shake my head. “But I can’t just ignore it, because it’s important to me. To both of us. And if something goes wrong… everything will.” I look at her. She’s still staring at me, her face blank. “Does that make any sense?”  She nods in confirmation. “Not really.”  I clench my fist to suppress myself. “I’m just scared, for her and for us.”  She nods again, although clearly that doesn’t mean much at all. “You’re scared to talk about a scary thing.”  “Yeah, that’s one way of putting it. I guess.”  “Well…” She blinks, somehow pointedly. “Just don’t talk about it then.” She smiles. “If something is scary to me, I don’t talk about it ever. I only talk about things that I like, like banana ice cream and oranges and painting and long walks and sleeping.”  “What are you scared of then?”  She cocks her head to the side again. “I can’t tell you. That would be talking about it.”  “Fair enough.” I notice that we’ve nearly reached the town. “I guess I’ll catch you later?”  She looks at me blankly. “Nobody’s throwing me. Am I going to fall?”  I close my eyes and take a deep breath. “Goodbye, Rin.”  “Ah. Yes. Goodbye, Hisao. I hope you find your mystery.”  “My what?”  She grins again. “The mystery toilet girl. I hope you find her.”  “Yeah, okay. Thanks I guess. See you later.”  “You’re seeing me now.”  Another breath. “Stop that.”  She frowns. “Stop what?”  I’m about to explain, but I realize how pointless it is. “Never mind.” I walk away before she can continue this inane conversation. I don’t understand how Emi stands her. Everything she says is disjointed and unconnected, and everything you say to her she either takes literally or just ignores. It’s like talking to a brick wall, except the wall will say random words every now and then and expect you to understand.  I can’t help but think about what she said. Regardless of whether or not she meant it as advice, the idea of not talking about it could be a better idea than trying to patch things up. I can let her bring it to me on her own time, and make up for what I said some other way. I don’t know if I can trust anything coming from Rin’s mouth, but she could actually have a point.  I try to think of where I would find her if she were here. She could have gone to the convenience store to buy something, but I doubt she’d have gone alone. Suddenly, I realize she might have gotten caught in the rain like I did. If she had come to town, she’d try to warm up after that. And the best place to do that…  Fripperies  The Shanghai is as close to feeling like home as a restaurant can get, with the paper lanterns and the warm lighting. Yuuko is nowhere to be found at the moment, and I decide it’s probably best to get out of the doorway before she notices and has a panic attack. I scan the different tables throughout the building, when my eyes land on a familiar head of hair. Relief floods through me – I finally found her.  I shuffle over to the table and sit down across from Hanako. She jumps, startled, before recognizing me. “Oh!” She blushes, and places her tea cup down on the table awkwardly. “H-hi Hisao.”  “I’ve been looking everywhere for you! Where were you today?”  She looks down at her feet. “In my dorm.”  I feel a pang of guilt. She couldn’t even bring herself to leave her room in the morning. But if she’s here now, she must be feeling better. “How do you feel?”  She smiles softly. “Good. I-I think.” She looks up at me, her eyes glistening. “Hisao, I’m sorry about yesterday. I’ve been f-feeling awful all day about it a-and I didn’t want to f-face you. I thought that y-you’d be angry with me, and I was s-s-scared.”  “Hanako…” I say affectionately, placing my hand on the table, palm upright. She smiles, taking my hand and looking into my eyes.  Choice A: “Don’t worry about it.”  Choice B: “It was my fault.”  You can vote on your choice here."

katawashoujo,3aidht,ididntdonothing,3,Sat Jun 20 17:08:48 2015 UTC,"As /u/Xilirite already mentioned, we discussed this a bit before hand. That said, we wouldnt have published if we didnt think that it fit the story. I would say that generally you would be right to think that, but considering that Hisao seems to be just leaving a pseudo depressive state from his hospitalization, it makes sense that hes going to start over reacting a bit now that hes more emotionally elevated."
katawashoujo,3aidht,goofyomnivore,2,Sat Jun 20 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"The other members of the writing club share your sentiment -- I felt that Hisao, being left in the dark about his relationship's future and having just had his first big fight with his girlfriend, would probably be in a less than stellar mood, especially when dealing with somebody as potentially infuriating as Rin. That's all kinda subjective though -- Thanks for the feedback, and I hope you read the next chapter!"
katawashoujo,3aidht,ChihuahuaGod,2,Sat Jun 20 17:34:01 2015 UTC,I like it a lot! You guys must have some pretty good writers. I feel like B is the right answer here since Hisao was kind of an ass about it.   Looking forward to the next installation

katawashoujo,3af5gl,velocirapetor3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:03:07 2015 UTC,I'd like portal 1 and/or 2 if you've still got!  https://steamcommunity.com/id/kcieatbabybunnyz

katawashoujo,3af5gl,aflyingfatman,4,Sat Jun 20 06:42:39 2015 UTC,"OK, so, for D&D, after looking at the out come of the poll, 6 PM GMT seems like is would be the best time. Most people who took the poll seemed to be in GMT time so I wanted to base it off that. MST was the second largest time zone, with 2 people voting for it, which is why I'm not too happy about how late it is, but I'm in MST so who ever was the other person to vote MST please tell me if it is a good time. Only 5 different time zones got voted so here are the converted times from 6PM GMT for those other 4 time zones:  12PM MST  7PM CT  2PM ET  11AM PST  In addition, Friday nights to Saturday mornings seemed to be the best time, and if this time or day doesn't work for you please tell me, it won't be too too hard to work out with a new time and day. Some other important info, it looks as if the majority of people want to go 5e. Me and a few other people in the poll have never played D&D before, but I have played other table top games and I tried to start playing D&D about 6 months ago, so I think I will learn fairly fast. But before I spend a lot of time learning an edition I want to know which one we are using. I'm going to be the DM for the first campaign, if anyone wants to DM afterwards let me know and you will be the next DM. I'm going to using Roll20.net so if you don't have an account please sign up with them before the game starts. And lastly, I want to put a list of all the voters here so that you know if you got put on the list or if you no longer want to play to be asked to be taken off the list. So, here is everyone who has signed up so far:  /u/thatJainaGirl  /u/daan831  /u/HazelKim  /u/Gore_Lily  /u/SenSenSen  /u/aflyingfatman  /u/Phoenixeye0  /u/Ipskies  /u/FlyingChihuahua  /u/TomokoNoKokoro  And if you aren't on this list but want to be please take the poll here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QEDLQePbOaC8mfpPy76bwKD0bfW1_ZO6plOONS4kaY4/viewform  and I will take in account your time zone and such for planing.  Edit: Forgot to say the first session will be on the 26th of this month  Edit 2: I might have to move it back to 11PM GMT, how would every feel about that?  Edit 3: Sounds like the time and date won't work, so for now it's back up in the air again until I can work it out with every one."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,thatJainaGirl,2,Fri Jun 19 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"Would it be beneficial to set up some sort of messaging group for everyone to communicate outside of the Roll20 game? Just to make communication between everyone easier for organising times, dates and what edition we'll be playing?"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,SenSenSen,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:42:13 2015 UTC,I work most days until 6:30 PM EST :(
katawashoujo,3af5gl,SenSenSen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"I guess that I could move it back to 11PM GMT, don't know how every one else would do with that, but I will try to move the time to make every thing work."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,daan831,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:45:26 2015 UTC,I got another D&D group now on Fridays so I actually can't play on weekend days at all now.
katawashoujo,3af5gl,daan831,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:12:35 2015 UTC,Can you ply any other day of the week? Or is that one group enough for your D&D fix? If you still want to play I might be able to move it the Thursday.
katawashoujo,3af5gl,daan831,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:47:23 2015 UTC,I'll find out I guess. I got Swordfighting Training on Thursdays though. Any other day is okay.
katawashoujo,3af5gl,chaosprimus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:48:34 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'm not going to be able to start it until most likely next month, so it gives you a lot of time to think if you want to play in 2 different groups. Date and time is still up in the air thou, so no worries."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,chaosprimus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:51:07 2015 UTC,"11 PM GMT would be a no-go for me, but 6:00-6:30 GMT would be fine for me.  Also, I might not be there for the first one, because my test week is the week after that and I have to do well in order to pass this year  :( (I can probably schedule around it though)  EDIT: typoed the time, fixed that now."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Blindweaponsfumbler,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"Alright, it is going to take me a while to find a date and time that works for everyone so I'm going to move the first session to a later date. I want to do it a week later but that is near the 4th of July and then some people want be able to play, so the date for the first session is now up in the air again."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,chaosprimus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:33:41 2015 UTC,"well, as it stands right now I can't be there on the 14th and the 20th of July (party with irl friends and my 17th birthday :D) but I'm free from the 7th of July."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Blindweaponsfumbler,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"Alright cool, and one last thing, are you fine with 5e? No one has said anything about what version we are using except one person said ""Anything but 4e""."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Blindweaponsfumbler,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:48:47 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what the differences are, as I never played D&D before, so I don't care which version we use."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Phoenixeye0,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:50:51 2015 UTC,"Out of interest, what version will you be playing?"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Gore_Lily,2,Fri Jun 19 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"Looking like 5e, but the only thing said about version was a while ago and some one said ""Anything but 4e"" so I guess we are going with 5e. If no one says anything by Sunday then I'm just going a head with 5e."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,daan831,2,Fri Jun 19 21:45:56 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a good idea. From what I've read it seems to be a vast improvement over 4th Edition. Alternatively there's Pathfinder, which is a modified 3.5. Rather refined and I can personally recommend it."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,HazelKim,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:07:09 2015 UTC,Seconded for the recommendation of pathfinder.  Almost everything's online whereas 5e would have all the players buying a relatively new system.
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Phoenixeye0,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:57:43 2015 UTC,"True. Pathfinder has a lot of the stuff accessible online, is cheaper and a lot more stuff additions and resources."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,OneManArmy77,2,Fri Jun 19 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah though /u/maybenickcage should consider limiting what splat books people can draw from, some are plain broken."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Murloo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"So should I do pathfinder and not 5e? I don't want to learn one just to find out we are playing on another. Also, which splat books should I limit if we are playing pathfinder?"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,OneManArmy77,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:36:46 2015 UTC,"I haven't played pathfinder in a while so the limitations are up to you, but I'd stay away from 5e because of expense alone, plus it's new so it's less likely any of your players know the system. Do you have any experience DMing?  Here's pathfinder by the way http://www.d20pfsrd.com"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,OneManArmy77,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:59:07 2015 UTC,"I actually know 5e very well and I have PDFs of all materials for it. Even if I don't necessarily DM, I can teach everyone the mechanics. It's incredibly simple, even more so than Pathfinder IMO."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,goofyomnivore,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:27:17 2015 UTC,"Blindweaponsfumbler has a good point about cost, but on the other hand, using 5E as an alternative to Pathfinder would mean that we wouldn't have to worry about figuring out which books/rules are okay to use. I believe right now only the core three 5E books are out, of which only the Player's Handbook is really needed for the PCs.   It's a trade-off of initial cost vs scope of the rules for people who are new to D&D or want to try 5E."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,OneManArmy77,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:32:16 2015 UTC,"How are we going to communicate? Are we just using a ingame text message system (don't know roll20.net), or are we using something like Skype or Teamspeak?"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,OneManArmy77,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:02:03 2015 UTC,I would imagine we use roll20 and Teamspeak. Teamspeak is usually better than skype for larger calls.
katawashoujo,3af5gl,brythain,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:20:29 2015 UTC,"I saw where you were having issues with deciding on a version to play. As far as 5th edition goes, I am VERY adept with it and have already DM'd 2 campaigns with it. It's extremely easy to learn and I can teach everyone how it works, and I have copies of all the necessary books in PDF format that I'm more than willing to share if people need it. Just an FYI."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,chaosprimus,3,Sat Jun 20 13:09:54 2015 UTC,"Its been a busy fucking week for me with physics tests, but I feel like I did some cool shit as well. I was just looking over the Monday Musings thread again at some of the responses, and its just phenomenal to see so much support. If its gonna be like that every week, Ill have to work extra hard to build up more quality prompts. As it is, I already have enough for 5 weeks worth at 2 per week.   So, how are you guys doing?"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Phoenixeye0,4,Fri Jun 19 17:09:31 2015 UTC,"Discovered the many wonders of fish and chips for the first time in my life, how did i live without this"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,chaosprimus,2,Fri Jun 19 17:18:47 2015 UTC,"Fuck man, I'm trying to cut back on fried foods and carbs so its off limits, but damn are they good. Tartar sauce and malt vinegar work great with it, if you havent tried those already."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Phoenixeye0,2,Fri Jun 19 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"I'm doing good, it was been a uneventful week so far but next week I start summer school and have to do a lot of planning for the D&D campaign so I will be super busy next week. Also I missed the Monday Musings thing, just check that out and it looks really fun. I'm not very good at writing, but I might try to write something at least for one week or so."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,chaosprimus,2,Fri Jun 19 17:50:55 2015 UTC,"The whole point is for non writers to get into writing, and for writers to get better and have a fun challenge, so go for it! Everyone's gotta start somewhere"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Phoenixeye0,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"I suggest trying it out. I had never written any stories outside of university/high school assignments, and I had a blast with the two prompts."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,chaosprimus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:58:00 2015 UTC,"You did a pretty damn good job with it too, IIRC"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Phoenixeye0,3,Fri Jun 19 23:14:22 2015 UTC,<3
katawashoujo,3af5gl,chaosprimus,2,Fri Jun 19 17:28:24 2015 UTC,"The more, the better. :)"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Phoenixeye0,3,Fri Jun 19 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"I've been taking a break from my usual games, so not to stress myself out too much. Picked up a visual novel on Steam for cheap; If My Heart Had Wings. It's different, it's not Katawa Shoujo, but I'm still enjoying it. Well worth £3.74."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,PaperAirship,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"You should look into the restoration patch and Sweet Love UI patch. Restores the missing H scenes and other content and is a direct translation of the original game. I warn you though, Ageha's route is terribly translated in either version, so personally I'd skip it unless you're prepared to laugh hysterically at how bad it is at some parts."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,PaperAirship,2,Fri Jun 19 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, I immediately got them, though thanks for the recommendation anyway! Was a bugger to get to work though. I'll agree the translation in general is somewhat lacklustre, good to know it's Ageha's route that is the worst of them; Found myself not as interested in her as the other 4. How many of the routes have you gone down? Got a favourite?"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,PaperAirship,2,Sat Jun 20 13:29:44 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm in my 4th route, which is Yoru's. Most people say that Amane's was pretty solid, so I'm saving hers for last. Each one has its merits in terms of what's great about them. I think Kotori's was the most ""feelsy"" for me once it built up."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Blindweaponsfumbler,2,Sat Jun 20 14:47:57 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly feeling that at the moment; Certainly making me feel some feels! I was planning on doing Amane next. You reckon I should save it to last too, or are Yoru's and Asa's route enjoyable enough?"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,velocirapetor3,2,Sat Jun 20 16:43:54 2015 UTC,"I would. I enjoy Asa and Yoru's route(s). They kinda blend together a bit, which I can't really explain without spoiling anything. I will say this much about Ageha's. If you can make heads or tails of what the hell is going on through the rough translation, it eventually picks up to a point where it's enjoyable. From what I've gathered, her H scenes are the only ones that are actually pertinent to the story. But there is a LOT of fan service in her route."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Parzivus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:16:55 2015 UTC,"Well, as long as they aren't unenjoyable! And I'm sure I'll be able to find someone on the internet who understands what's going on in Ageha's route even if I can't. Glad to hear some H scenes are important in some way though. One of the things I loved about Katawa Shoujo was that the H scenes for the most part felt somewhat integral to the story. And oh dear. Hopefully the fan service won't be too distracting..."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,arandomshot,2,Sat Jun 20 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"Oh I understand Ageha's route perfectly. It's just confusing at first. If you need help grasping it, let me know. As far as H scenes go, the dialogue was a little.... overemphasized.   If you want some examples of how bad the translation is in her route, check out these gems:  http://i.imgur.com/3wNKTP6.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/iE8IqWL.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/qLXmp9C.jpg"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,NoviceElectromancer,2,Sat Jun 20 19:23:02 2015 UTC,"Oh god this is amazing. The first almost makes sense, the second is amazingly bad. The third I laughed out loud at. Harsh. Poor Kotori! I felt that Kotori's H scenes that I've encountered so far (Just past the bath scene) was done somewhat, well, indelicately. The language was unusual to say the least, or is that just me? And thanks, will do!"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,ChihuahuaGod,2,Sat Jun 20 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"There were many, many times like these, and I legit bust out laughing at nearly all of them. The first one could potentially make sense were it not for the context in which it was said.  No, it definitely isn't just you. I think they would have been better off leaving it to simple dialogue or ""descriptions"" versus actually phonetically wording it out."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,BlazingSakura,2,Sat Jun 20 19:36:56 2015 UTC,"I finally put my $100 worth of giftcards to use and bought myself a shit-ton of Lego. Built it all, and then had it promptly destroyed by one of my cats. Now its all just sitting in the box it shipped in because I don't want to think about putting it all together again."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,TrebbleBiscuit,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:44:07 2015 UTC,"What kind of cats do you have? I have been thinking of buying a cat for a very long time but I don't know what kind to get. Also, in my house there are a ton of boxed Legos that I haven't thought about in a long time, I almost want to go dig them up and try to make some thing."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,lespuka,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"My cats were all SPCA adoptions, so I couldn't tell you much about them besides their colours and the ranking of their meow's annoyingness.  And if you decide you don't want that Lego anymore, I'll gladly take it off your hands"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,TrebbleBiscuit,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"How many cats do you have? And what colors are they? I really want to get a ragdoll cat or a norwegian forest cat but there is 2 big problems with that: Both kinds of cats cost a ton of money, a ragdoll can cost around $1000 and I don't have that kind of money of a cat. And two, I live in Arizona, and it gets really hot here, so with all the fur that would get over heated very soon and would not have a very good life here."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,lespuka,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:47:46 2015 UTC,"There's three: The orange grumpy one, the piebald whiny one, and the black happy-go-lucky one.  I'm a big advocate for adopting from shelters, so I would always recommend that over paying an absurd amount to a breeder.  As for the Arizona problem, I live in the frozen north, so I wouldn't be able to give much advice on how to deal with the heat."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,HazelKim,2,Fri Jun 19 17:56:45 2015 UTC,Play aggressively or play defensively?  Have any of you guys ever played diplomacy?  Some far off friends and I are playing this summer.  It's kind of like a really slow version of risk that focuses a lot around making and backstabbing (their word not mine) allies. It used to be played in the mail but thanks to the internet things are slightly faster. It takes seven players and not much time out of your day. If there's any interest I'd love to get a game going with some Katawa Shoubros.
katawashoujo,3af5gl,daan831,2,Fri Jun 19 18:14:56 2015 UTC,Anybody got a good VN/anime rec?
katawashoujo,3af5gl,daan831,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"VN: recently played Sepia Tears, very good and well written game.  Definitely worth. Also playing Stellaren, which is dark and a lot of fun but not very high quality in terms of art. Music is nice though. Anime: Just finished Amagi Brilliant Park, amazing comedy/drama. Everything kyoani is a good bet. Lots more if you need more anime to watch."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,tempusers,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:55:33 2015 UTC,"If you haven't played Grisaia no Kajitsu, I highly recommend it.   Very long, but very well done, also quite hilarious."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,daan831,2,Sat Jun 20 04:12:54 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World is a solid 8/10.  Great, fun film with a few very, very stupid parts. A fun summer movie that I gladly watched but would not want to watch again. Better than the two other sequels, but still not as good as the original."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Phoenixeye0,2,Sat Jun 20 15:25:59 2015 UTC,Hi. It's Satruday. Whatever.  I'm addicted to Bastion's soundtrack. Please send help.
katawashoujo,3af5gl,Magniras,2,Sat Jun 20 00:10:28 2015 UTC,"Watched the season finale of JoJo today. It was amazing. No Part 4 teaser (cry cry :'( ).  Also went down to the theaters to watch Inside Out. That was really good too! I will admit the conflict of adapting to a new area was beating a dead horse, but it was the best I've seen that conflict done.   Also, I'm rocking the Lilly flair now (at least for a bit) because while I still love Emi the most by a slight margin, I felt like I needed to express some love for my other three best girls. (Why can't I just live in a perfect world where I can have four flairs? brb crying.)"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,OneManArmy77,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:24:29 2015 UTC,"I just finished eden*, a VN that's on sale during the Steam summer sale for $10, it was worth every penny. I marathon'd the whole thing, which may have been a poor decision, but I really enjoyed it. Have you guys read any other good VNs lately?"
katawashoujo,3af5gl,MasterlessAshenMyles,2,Fri Jun 19 21:54:16 2015 UTC,"I'm currently reading GnK, which is huge. So far it has managed to bring me to tears twice, and I'm not nearly done with it, apparently.  So far I really like it, and considering summer break has started, I probably will be able to finish it before the start of the upcoming school semester."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,HazelKim,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:04:01 2015 UTC,"I've been wanting to read that, but it's so long that it's kind of hard to motivate myself to actually get started."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,MasterlessAshenMyles,2,Fri Jun 19 17:39:52 2015 UTC,"I can definitely understand that. It took a while, but I'm a relatively fast reader and am currently, approximately 25-35% done with the first arc I got (17 hours so far).   Not to mention that the steam version is expensive and cut/censored. To me it was a pain to try to download it elsewhere. In the end I just opted for the steam version though."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,HazelKim,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"GnK is fantastic if you can get over its pacing issues. The common route is very long. If you do read it, going with Makina's route is a good idea because you learn more about the protagonist's past than the others."
katawashoujo,3af5gl,UnknownMango,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:46:01 2015 UTC,what does GnK stand for?

katawashoujo,3af5gl,daan831,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:42:50 2015 UTC,It is incredibly long. Took me 20 hours to finish the first route (Kotori's).

katawashoujo,3ablj7,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:02:57 2015 UTC,"Japanese Braille:       Japanese Braille is the braille script of the Japanese language. It is based on the original braille script, though the connection is tenuous. In Japanese it is known as tenji (点字 ?), literally ""dot characters"". It transcribes Japanese more or less as it would be written in the hiragana or katakana syllabaries, without any provision for writing kanji (Chinese characters).  Japanese Braille is a vowel-based abugida. That is, the glyphs are syllabic, but unlike kana they contain separate symbols for consonant and vowel, and the vowel takes primacy. The vowels are written in the upper left corner (points 1, 2, 4) and may be used alone. The consonants are written in the lower right corner (points 3, 5, 6) and cannot occur alone.  However, the semivowel y is indicated by point 4, one of the vowel points, and the vowel combination is dropped to the bottom of the block. When this point is written in isolation, it indicates that the following syllable has a medial y, as in mya. Syllables beginning with w are indicated by dropping the vowel points to the bottom of the cell without additional consonant points.

The school must have used it awhile back, but we have n-newer models. I just asked Yuuko if I c-could borrow it.” She shovels a morsel of salad into her mouth in an attempt to avoid further questioning. I figure I wont be getting much more out of her for now, so I drape my arms around her neck like a scarf, and we watch the movie, clip by clip and mouthful by mouthful.  …  Comfort  Both the food and the movie are gone all too quickly. I give a sigh of contentment and look over at Hanako. She’s looks so peaceful sitting out here, and without anyone else nearby, Hanako lets her guard down. I can see the discolored burn marks more clearly since she makes little effort in hiding them. I’m sure a glass or two of wine didn’t hurt either. I dare to break the stillness with a couple words.  “So, are you happy to be done with finals?” I ask innocuously. She turns towards me before giving a short nod. “It’s nice to not have that looming over us anymore. Do you want to go to the graduation party this weekend? I’ve heard Shizune and Misha have been working overtime to put it together on such short notice. I figure it could be pretty fun since it’s the last festival before we graduate.” Hanako leans over and hugs my waist, closing her eyes.  “Only if you’re there with me.” She mumbles into my shirt, just barely audible in the crisp night breeze. I rest my head on hers getting another whiff of cherry blossoms.  “You know, I was thinking about what my plans were after graduation, and I realized I need to start applying to universities or something. I was talking with Kenji and I realized I don’t actually have any idea of what I’m going to do after Yamaku. Do you have any plans yet?”  Hanako unwraps her arms and sits up, startling me slightly. She puts a thoughtful finger to her chin. “I was t-thinking of traveling or something. There’s so many places I’ve r-read about that I want to visit. I don’t know about after though…” She trails off.  Cut music  “You don’t want to come with me to university if I go?” I ask, being careful not to lace my words with concern. I’d much rather have her by my side if I can help it.  “I…I don’t know” Hanako answers in a very subdued way and starts fidgeting with one of the plates. I’ve brought up this before, but she always seems to want to avoid the topic. Even after trying to get to know her for awhile, she is still harder to read than a good poker player. That does nothing to assuage my concerns, however.

katawashoujo,3a9bii,Starbucks_,6,Thu Jun 18 06:44:22 2015 UTC,"I really like this! If I can offer some real feedback, it sounds like the dynamic range is a tad bit compressed though. Granted I'm listening on my wireless beats headphones at work, so I can't really get a proper feel for it, and it's soundcloud. I'll have to listen on my studio equipment when I get home. But overall, I really like this sample."
katawashoujo,3a9bii,Phoenixeye0,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:50:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! Yes there's a lot of distortion going on here, I was trying some new things on FL Studio but I should go back and remaster it sometime."
katawashoujo,3a9bii,goofyomnivore,2,Thu Jun 18 18:23:35 2015 UTC,I like it.  Red Velvet would make a neat hip hop sample with its jazzy sound imo.
katawashoujo,3a9bii,Morlok8k,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:01:53 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'll have to try that out! Lilly was my first route in the game so I have some really strong nostalgia for that song.
katawashoujo,3a9bii,Morlok8k,2,Thu Jun 18 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't like it.  Your added beats don't match up with the original tune.  So it ends up sounding like two separate pieces of music played at the same time instead of being complimentary.  It starts off kinda OK, but deviates after the intro.  After the intro it's just basically the same rhythm for the rest of the song, and doesn't account for the quieter and calmer parts.  Your rhythm itself is lacking something, and I'm not sure what.  The other issue is how sharp your sounds are.  They don't match the calm and subdued sounds of the song.  It's like this: ""la la la la... SNAP! la la la la... SNAP!""  Oh, and was the original music slowed down slightly?  I'm not quite sure."
katawashoujo,3a9bii,Morlok8k,3,Thu Jun 18 22:21:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input! I really appreciate the feedback and would love to hear some of your own work. Yes I did slow down the original slightly and added a delay effect to it with some other things, it was about a month ago. I don't sample much but prefer to make most of my music from the ground up, which might be the reason it doesn't sound very coherent."
katawashoujo,3a9bii,Joby05,3,Thu Jun 18 22:29:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not a musician.  I have no work for you to hear!  I just love the KS soundtrack so I tried to explain why it didn't feel right."
katawashoujo,3a9bii,Mikeandike010,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:38:48 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. Your initial comments gave me the impression that you had a musical background (with the exception of the ""la la la SNAP""). You have a good ear though, I think you would probably make a good musician."

katawashoujo,3a5dz7,FrankFalconi,3,Wed Jun 17 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"Glass case of emotion? Come take a ride on the clouds then dive into the sea of tumultuous emotions and bitter tears. There is no way to paddle, just drift. No way to control where you end up until you find a shoal that gently cradles you. Back to life you spring, unsure and unsteady. Could be fear, could be loss. What was is not now, now is you after. Even should we not be able to cross that thrashing beast, we need not fear it but learn from it.  The greatest strength, the deepest feeling -- not separate nor one whole. They are all parts as we are all parts. What river may guide you leads to the expanse some must weather but altogether we are better, not then, not even now, but after we embolden ourselves with parts that are greater than their wholes to do what we must to accept parts into our own parts to be whole new horizon beyond what sum may be.  Really got away from myself and not sure what it should really mean. Think maybe it started as a little silly thing comparing how I felt after certain events but honestly I am glad there was an overwhelming sense to what you experienced. It means you have accepted something new into yourself, shared it, and now others may be able to add part of that to their own."

katawashoujo,3a86et,300BillionDegrees,3,Thu Jun 18 00:22:40 2015 UTC,"Not a big problem really. On your next play through, you can hit skip mode, and it will skip anything you've read already and stop and choices or new text."
katawashoujo,3a86et,goobernuts19,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:09:22 2015 UTC,"So skip mode would skip to the first choice, then based on that, keep skipping or show the new text?  ....interesting"
katawashoujo,3a86et,Crowst,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:37:05 2015 UTC,Skip mode skips over text that you've already read.
katawashoujo,3a86et,Parzivus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:52:51 2015 UTC,"It rapidly plays through the text/animations still, but yeah it skips if the scene is identical. In some cases the dialogue is nearly identical, but because the scene is technically different because you chose a different option it won't skip."
katawashoujo,3a86et,OneManArmy77,2,Thu Jun 18 02:14:42 2015 UTC,I went with my gut the first time and fell off a roof. 10/10 would recommend.

katawashoujo,3a3gzh,Darkon-Kriv,3,Wed Jun 17 02:04:50 2015 UTC,Are they actually for sale?
katawashoujo,3a3gzh,Darkon-Kriv,2,Wed Jun 17 13:54:27 2015 UTC,"No, I actually asked 4LS if it was OK with them to have a shapeways store with 0% markup, but they said no -- but all that means is that you'll have to load up the .zip files when I release them on shapeways yourself and print it out.  It's a lot like cafepress in that you can just print your own stuff without making it a storefront (you can print your own KS T-shirts that way, too, 4LS just doesn't want actual online stores).  And, of course, if you have access to a 3D printer, you don't have to go through shapeways.  Plus, I'll include a few different facial .jpgs for each girl, so you can make Lilly with her eyes closed, etc. or just draw your own face if you prefer.  You can also scale them to different sizes.  I'll also release the Gimp and Blender files so you can make your own poses, clothes, etc.  I should add Miki at some point, she would be pretty easy since her hair is similar to Hanako's."

katawashoujo,3a3gzh,TheJeter,3,Fri Jun 19 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"When you make Hanako, I have a suggestion. Can you put her sitting in a beanbag chair reading a book? I imagine it might cost more but the print would be a lot more solid and stable."
katawashoujo,3a3gzh,Sigma1977,2,Thu Jun 18 12:18:33 2015 UTC,"I have three test sets being printed right now:  First set, including the redone Lilly, has them all standing in similar poses to the group photo, plus Misha.  Second set, they're all sitting (so they sit on the edge of a shelf) naked, as if they are at a hot springs.  Third set is same as second set, except they are scaled to 80% (about half the volume .83, so half the cost), to compare print size difference, plus they are wearing swimsuits.  I'm working on another set and was planning on Hanako reading, but as if she was sitting on the floor at Lilly's Japanese table (Lilly also sitting drinking tea)."
katawashoujo,3a53ul,TacticalLuke,4,Wed Jun 17 08:19:31 2015 UTC,"I would say they all have more or less comparable depth. Some are better than others, but it's mostly in opinion. I loved Emi, Hanako, and Lilly's routes, and found I enjoyed Shizune and Rin's far less.  Emi is in my opinion one of the best intros to visual novels (not just KS). The relationship you share with her is dynamic in such a way that it feels natural, like it was meant to be, except the few times when things hit the wall. Whereas with Hanako there's a lot more reluctance and trepidation not to step on her toes about insecurities, or with Shizune there's the language barrier.  Either way, I had similar feelings to what you described reading through most of the routes. In the end it's really your choice though. With that, happy reading, or should you choose to stop with Emi, happy making up headcanon involving your new best girl."
katawashoujo,3a53ul,Oceantyde77,7,Wed Jun 17 08:50:08 2015 UTC,"You can treat the 'full experience' however you'd like. Whether it's just Emi's route, Hanako's, or all 6 of them, it's fine.  The feeling may fade with time and you might want to read the other routes at some point, but just know that you don't have to read the other routes if you really don't want to/can't.  KS is a VN without a canon ending, but it's more than possible to implement your own 'canon ending/route.'"
katawashoujo,3a53ul,TheDwarfLard,2,Wed Jun 17 08:25:44 2015 UTC,"Would you say all the routes have comparable depth? Im partially worried about diving into another just to find it less engaging, even aside from the ""natural"" feel i had with Emi's route that i dont expect to be replicated."
katawashoujo,3a53ul,aflyingfatman,3,Wed Jun 17 08:31:32 2015 UTC,"As other have mentioned, each route tends to have different impacts with different people. It is still worth playing all of them, if you can, because all the routes are magnificently well thought out and well written. I don't think you have anything to worry about concerning a lack of depth or a route being less engaging."

katawashoujo,3a53ul,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:15:51 2015 UTC,"The routes are different - you are unlikely to find that they all engage you on the same level (which is only natural - different things appeal to different people).  You may find some are even more intense than Emi's, you may find some are rather hard to 'gel' with.  Only real way to find out what works for -you- is to read through.  FWIW, I enjoyed Emi's route a lot, but really loved Lilly's. And Hanako's."
katawashoujo,3a53ul,AnatoleSerial,0,Wed Jun 17 09:59:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not the one to ask, but I believe each has at least some depth to it and merit. Some generally have stronger impacts for people, but that doesn't mean they all won't."

Are you open to different ideas? I really liked the prompt and was happy to write one weekly but I wanna try and write Shizune (I'm not familiar with all 5 girls). Any thoughts?"
katawashoujo,3a3dq4,Joby05,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:51:29 2015 UTC,"Im absolutely open to other ideas, but the point of this group is more continuity rather than just a one shot, which means that you would have to learn to write the whatever path we decide to continue off of as well as any sub characters that might feature in your bit of the story. I can say with some certainty that the Monday Musings wont be going away any time soon (I wrote up prompts for 5 weeks worth already), so if you are uncomfortable writing the other girls, then you can feel free to work with the Monday prompts until you feel ready. My advice is to try getting outside of your comfort zone with the prompts until you feel like you can handle this, which is basically a bigger prompt with an end goal as well. Id be happy to work with you though if you have another idea on hand. I will say though that there are multiple Shizune prompts in Monday Musing's future, including next week."
katawashoujo,3a3dq4,Joby05,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:00:10 2015 UTC,I think the best prompts would be open ended. My problem is that I haven't finished the 5 girls and so I definitely can't write them. I guess I will sit it out a while and see what it's all about first.4
katawashoujo,3a3dq4,PaperAirship,2,Tue Jun 16 23:08:37 2015 UTC,"I think thats a good idea. As for the prompts, I like the open ended ones, but they are actually very hard to come up with. There are so many more things you can do with established characters that you cant with ""that girl"", as Im sure you will agree when you get to see a couple of them. It does add to the challenge and makes it more constricting, but Im hoping to find a good balance"

katawashoujo,3a3v5m,OneManArmy77,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:20:41 2015 UTC,"Meiko   Exactly. They present so much dialogue and the character will just show up unprovoked, have many, long conversations that appear to be an important of the plot and then nothing. Thats the only problum I have with the game. If your not going to give a character an arc dont give them a seemingly important presence."
katawashoujo,3a3v5m,BlazingSakura,6,Wed Jun 17 03:12:52 2015 UTC,"I kind of would have liked to see a Kenji route.  No really.  One that actually addresses what is up with his psyche. While I appreciate him just as much the comic relief and think that it is just as good that he doesn't have an arc, I would like to have delved a bit more into why he is the way he is and more about him in general."
katawashoujo,3a3v5m,Blindweaponsfumbler,9,Wed Jun 17 01:14:24 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, I want a Kenji end to each route (perhaps unlockable after finishing a route once) where you believe Kenji's nonsense and go off on a route themed adventure.   Rin: you convince Kenji that Rin is a guy, Kenji gets you two into a scheme to destroy feminist propaganda at a local art show (Rin's art show unbeknownst to you and Kenji but beknownst to Rin), Rin plays along because she doesn't think she got the message she was trying to get across.  Kenji finds out it's Rin's art and accidentally helps Rin come to terms with her communications skills while trying to convince her that she is a brilliant propagandist fighting feminists  Lilly: kenji convinces you that Lilly is a mafia boss, you and Kenji try and get her deported to Russia, Kenji and Akira engage in increasingly complicated assassination attempts on each other while Lilly learns to turn to others for help in times of need in the face of her sisters sudden erratic behaviour.  Emi: you and Emi relationship as normal, you and Kenji become the Yamaku cat burglars. Through increasingly hair brained schemes Yuuko and Kenji get back together.  I had a plan where Kenji and you destroy the feminist training ground that was the track team with Miki and Emi as tag team bosses, but this seemed like the best way to get a Yuuko ending what with the book plot already being there and I could work Emi's emotional issues in. This would be the only Kenji end possible in a first play through, because it doesn't effect the main route as much, Emi's route is notoriously ""easier"", and as a clue that the rest of the Kenji ends are hidden.  Hanako: early in the route Hisao spots Kenji while in the library with Hanako.  Kenji doesn't trust that the quit girl is only reading and is trying to figure out how she got herself in a school for disabled students.  Various funny moments ensue where Hisao tries to explain her scares to Kenji but he dances around the issue (because this is Hisao in Hanako's route) and Kenji just doesn't see them.  Hanako notices this strange man hanging around her sort of possible love interest and tries to branch out to Hisao's friend Kenji pretends she can't see him when ever she tries.  And dealing with this strange issue that is facing him and Hanako without knowing how to deal with it forces Hisao to take off the kid cloves.  Kenji is the anti Lilly driving them together with crazy instead of affection, he also manages his way into the birthday party only to leave with Akira on the promise of a job.  Shizune: you agree to stay in the council as an actual spy. You play mind games against Shizune to bring down the feminist council, ends in climactic dual between Kenji and Jigoro. Shizune solves her emotional problems on her own because best girl don't need to magic boyfriend"

katawashoujo,3a3v5m,unprofessionalautist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:53:13 2015 UTC,"I've been coming back to an idea to write a Kenji fanfiction in the style of a route, as in like a script rather than a novel. I've never written ""fanfiction"" before in the strictest sense but after beating Shizune's route I felt that there really could be a strong relationship between Hisao and Kenji if the right circumstances were to happen (like with all the girls, for example - Hisao only gets to know them in a certain context, which never happens for Kenji).  I'm guessing people have tried something like this before, though? I dunno, I just feel like that amount of humanity we saw in Kenji through Shizune's route could be expanded upon a lot, rather than just seeing him as a living joke. I spent a long part of my life being dishonest with myself and everyone else to keep up an image, so maybe I could bring something to it.  If I ever do get to writing anything instead of just imagining a structure and plot points in my head, I'll post it here. Does it sound at all like a good idea, or has this been done too much already?"

I would love to see a future where the creators have given their blessing to mods, and we have a massive library of alternate routes. For me, that would be a Suzu route, a Saki route, even a Kagami route (some fanfics are more grounded in the game than others). We could have alternate versions, entirely new characters, everything... Ah. It's unrealistic, and it would probably never happen, but I'm feeling optimistic today. So... Maybe."

katawashoujo,3a4v2t,Hats_Hats_Hats,6,Wed Jun 17 06:19:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd say you should consider going for Rin's last. I played it second and it hit me so hard that all the other routes barely had an impact in comparison (excluding Hanako's, who I played first, and Suzu's, who I cannot easily put into words).  Everyone ends up having their own best girl, though, and it's not something you can easily tell will happen beforehand. Follow where your heart takes you.  Rin's route is an odd one. She was a mystery to me and that's why I was drawn to her, and the emotional rollercoaster that is her route. I came away from it completely broken, while others I've seen come away from it only slightly less confused than they were when it began. Having an open mind helps. Thinking about it from more than just Hisao's POV is they key to really enjoying it, I think."
katawashoujo,3a4v2t,flameleaf,2,Wed Jun 17 07:46:20 2015 UTC,"Well, ""Rin's mystery"" is not what you expect  don't do her route if you don't want though"

I didn't realize she even had a route until my second playthrough, when I was trying to make sure I didn't end up on the same path twice.  I thought she was like Kenji, y'know?  Just a side character with some scenes.  Hearing that there's more to this is actually the most helpful comment in this thread so far.  Thanks!"

So I won't be able to really participate in the subreddit until I've 100%ed the library >_<"
katawashoujo,3a4v2t,Atario,2,Wed Jun 17 06:25:50 2015 UTC,"If you are adamant about 100% then that will include Rin, sadly. If you really had little interest in her in any way through Act 1 interactions then you will very likely not enjoy much of her route.  With that in mind though give it a go. It gets weird, strained, far off the world that the other girls dwell upon. Those that keen in any form upon her character tend to find it very polarizing. I do suggest still giving it a read as I think new perspectives are usually a good thing and hers is one that at least deserves to be experienced.  Don't feel bad if you feel you just can't connect and kind of speed through bits. There are tons of different kinds people and not all of them can relate so well to some of the others."

I did Rin's route third and I was so unenthusiastic about it because unlike every other girl, I couldn't relate to Rin at all. While it is personally my least favorite route out of the bunch, it does have its moments and is worth reading. Who knows, a lot of people still love her route, so you may too.  The only thing I must recommend against is saving her's for last instead. If you have that kind of impression of her in Act 1, I'd say it is not worth the gamble of ending the game on a sour note.  Hope it works out!"

For most of us, KS will always hold a special place in our hearts, but there are just so many other great stories. Plus, most other VNs are voice-acted and that adds a whole different element.

Also:   ""You know that you are even cuter when you pout?""   >:T  The grammar wasn't perfect, but it's more than readable. And I can definitely see Kenji being like that.  Lastly, in this post:   ... for the sake of the FF...  ... 7 years...   I don't care if it was intentional or not, it just made me laugh after reading the whole thing."

For now I only hope that the story made sense and that it's likable, because I find it easier to get around and improve my grammar for these works.  One again, thanks for the comment!"

I think the epilogue adds to it in a way that makes it a nice route to do last."
katawashoujo,39xyzj,Panory,2,Mon Jun 15 20:27:01 2015 UTC,"It really was the best one to do last. Cause even if Lilly isn't your personal favorite, there's no better high note to end on."

katawashoujo,3a0dic,Atario,2,Tue Jun 16 23:51:04 2015 UTC,"Heh, from what people have told me, it's best done in roughly three phases — main arcs (Emi/Hanako/Lilly/Rin/Shizune + Misha), then 'background arcs' (Rika/Mutou/Akira + Hideaki + Miki + Natsume), and then the other bits (which are ongoing at the moment). It's about a million words right now, so reading it at one shot is a bit much."

Even a depressed guy can only say no so many times to a cute girl begging to run with him.  Hanako after Lilly goes to Scotland might befriend him since they both enjoy the library. They would be kindred spirits as outcast/loners.  Misha is really nice to him in every route, but I don't think the two would ever get in a romantic relationship."

katawashoujo,3a0dic,Darkon-Kriv,3,Sun Jun 21 10:32:52 2015 UTC,"If he apologized to Misha for the ""fun fun fun at the nurse's office"" snap, she would forgive him, and I think things would have been ok. I don't think he would get to be with Lilly, Hanako, or Shizune after though. Lilly would remember him selling her short to Shizune earlier, and he missed out on that first romantic moment with Shizune with the fireworks.  If he actually fell and survived, I imagine he would be expelled for drinking on the roof of the school. Kenji would have admitted to coming on the roof to hang out with his buddy Hisao, bringing blankets and pretzels like a good friend should, but found Hisao drunk and ranting. Hisao denies this, but Kenji did not actually drink the whiskey, it was all an attempt to kill Hisao and make it look like an accident, so people reluctantly believe Kenji."

katawashoujo,3a08zd,goofyomnivore,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:48:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man. I work really hard on Misha because she's least like anyone I know! :)"
katawashoujo,3a08zd,Dannflor,3,Tue Jun 16 11:20:46 2015 UTC,"I'm going to read and give feedback on this because I've made it my goal to do the same to all of these prompt responses. (Honestly, it's really cool to see what the community can come up with.  First of all, wow! I'm blown away, this is really good stuff. Extremely well written and engaging to read. I mean it. :)  I really liked how you sort of, albeit vaguely linked the two prompts together. It wasn't done in a hamfisted way either but very eloquently.   I enjoyed the first entry a lot because it is very rare IMO to see stories set before the main event of Katawa Shoujo. Or at least, I haven't seen many. However, I think you captured the relationship between Lilly and Misha!Shizune quite well. I especially like her ""leaving"" and then allowing us to fill in the blanks, since we know she had to leave again. Last couple of lines were very impactful, and I think even more so for me given that I finished Lilly's route only a few days ago.  I liked the second entry too, took a very unique spin on things. Both entries are unique, but I've honestly never seen Hisao paired with Misha before. And I always like seeing new things. It connects to the first entry just enough so that you know it's part of the same timeline, but it doesn't try to force it down your throat.  The main thing I had a problem stomaching was the relationship between Shizune and Kenji, but I suppose in some alternate universe it could work. :P  Anyways, sorry about that. I really rambled a lot. I'm just super excited to see all these fanfics generated. And I enjoy reading them so I thought I'd try my best to give something resembling feedback.  Good job, I really enjoyed reading these. :)"

In fact I like each route or each girl in their own ways, there were just some that I gravitated towards and affected me more than others.  One day I might be in a Lilly mood and the next my favourite is Hanako again. But generally Rin and Hanako are the two that I'm closest to."

katawashoujo,39wsyr,OneManArmy77,8,Mon Jun 15 13:12:24 2015 UTC,"Hey! I think this is a great idea, really excited to see what comes out of this from the members of the community. It should also hopefully give me some incentive to write as well! :)  #####  [Prompt 1]  I feel something cold and wet graze my cheek, snapping me out of my meditation. I turn my head to see Rin, her deep green eyes fixed ahead. My attention is brought to the swirling points of white slowly drifting down around her auburn hair. With a glance upwards, I can see the blanket of snow cascading downwards, threatening to crush us under its embrace.  The weather is all too reminiscent of the last time I was here. The snow had begun to fall as Iwanako had confessed, her words very nearly snatched away by the driving wind. Then, not moments later, I had collapsed due to a weak heart. That was the day my life ended.  I turn once again to gaze at Rin. Her face contorted into a tight grimace in response to the chilling weather. I should head back inside, find a warm place to sit with Rin. Yet, something holds me out here, and I'm not sure what. Why did I come here? Certainly not out of any devotion for Iwanako. That ship has sailed and I am perfectly fine not being aboard it. No, this spot holds more significance than that for me.  As if echoing my thoughts, Rin speaks for the first time that we've been out here.  ""Hisao. Why are we here?""  I open my mouth to respond, but no words come out. I'm not sure if I can even answer that question myself. I could tell her of Iwanako, yet even as I stand on the spot she confessed to me, she feels irrelevant, a fading memory from another life. Looking into Rin's eyes, her gaze seeming to stare into my soul, I find my answer.  ""This is where I died.""  Rin stares at me, not responding, just waiting for me to continue.  ""This is the spot where a different Hisao once stood. A girl confessed to this Hisao, and then he died of a heart attack."" I take a deep breath of the chilly air, more sure of where I'm going with this now.  ""But it was also the beginning. The beginning of my new life at Yamaku, the beginning of my time with you. I think-..."" I trail off once again, unable to truly answer Rin's question. Why did I come here? Nostalgia? No, there was a greater force compelling me to come here. I think needed to come to terms with what happened here, reconcile with my past self.  ""I've often wished that I was ""normal"", that my heart had never bothered me. I don't want to be like that anymore. Wishing that I'm someone I'm not. This spot was the beginning of something wonderful, and I wouldn't change what happened for the world."" I say that almost all in one breath, my voice carrying a noticeably excited tone to it. It feels like a weight is being lifted off my shoulders, the baggage of my past slowly drifting away. I worry for a moment that I've lost Rin, but then I see her dark eyes staring into me, and I know that she understands.  After a long pause, she speaks.  ""You can finally be you."" She says this with an odd inflection, an almost questioning tone. I smile, Rin's words affecting more than I let on. In this moment, she truly understands me. After a deep breath, I take her shoulder in my hand and we begin to walk through the snow, back towards the lights and noise of the city, her words reverberating through my mind.  Yes. I can finally be me.  #####  That was a lot of fun to write. Although, I'm not really happy with the finished product. It's been way too long since I've done creative writing, I've just been too busy. However, it's something I love to do and hopefully this will get me back into it. :)"
katawashoujo,39wsyr,Dannflor,3,Mon Jun 15 20:09:13 2015 UTC,It reads nicely. I think you really captured how Rin starts to rub off on Hisao and the few words but big meaning way Rin seems to communicate. Im glad to see you are enjoying the thread as well!
katawashoujo,39wsyr,Dannflor,2,Mon Jun 15 21:47:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the hardest part is getting Rin and Hisao to speak. I'm very afraid of getting them do something out of character.

I enjoyed the pacing of the story, how Hisao wanted to show to Rin some of his past, how the two interacted... it felt right, in a way. I can't comment so much about the way you made Rin talk, tho I believe that you made Hisao talk, well, in a way he would talk? Yeah, not my brightest moment right here. Anyway! Good job, I liked the oneshot a lot and I hope to see more of you soon enough!"
katawashoujo,39wsyr,Joby05,2,Mon Jun 15 21:10:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for feedback.

A skilled observer might have noticed Lilly's nervous ticks, as she sat pensively waiting for the tell-tale knock on the door. A loud thud on the door causes Lilly to flinch, as Misha strolls in unaccompanied.""  “WAHAHAHAHAHA~~ HEY LILLY!! I Thought I might find you here.~~”   A skilled observer might also notice Lilly’s ever so slight sigh of annoyance, but Misha isn’t exactly the most astute girl in the world. “How can I help you Misha?” Lilly asks in her flawlessly polite tone.  “Whahaha I’m just walking around, why are you here all by yourself?~~”   “I’m just waiting for Hanako. Although she admittedly is a little late…”   “Well why don’t you go look for her you silly Lilly~~!?” saying the last words in such an annoying sing-songy way it made Lilly internally cringe.  “Well it would probably be best to wait for her here until-“ she gets cut off as Misha grabs her arm and starts pulling.   “WHAHAHA COME ON COME ON LET’S GO FIND HER!!” Misha practically shrieks with joy and laughter. Somehow Lilly isn’t sharing her same enthusiasm.   “Misha please, at least let me get my cane.” Lilly says trying to delicately keep her composure. “My my why must this nonsense happen today” she thinks.   “It’s OK! I’ll be your cane! Call me Citizen Kane!! WHAHAHA~~ Have you seen that movie Lilly?”  An ever so slightly louder sigh was emitted from Lilly. “No, I don’t think I have seen that movie. What’s it about?” she asks politely as Misha briskly leads her down the hall way. Misha babbles continuously as she leads her to….”The art room?” Lilly asks as she smells the paints and ceramics. “Why are we here?”   “HANAKOOOOOOO ARE YOU HERE?” Misha yells. “HELLOOOOOO?”  “Hello,” a much more mello voice yawns from the back of the room.   “WAHAHAHA HEY RIN~~! Have you seen Hanako?!  “No, I haven’t” Rin replies.   “LET ME CHECK THE SUPPLY CLOSET!” Misha cries.   “Um I don’t think…” Lilly tries to say as she hears a flurry of papers and scraps from the closet.   “Nope not there!” Misha announces to the universe.   Lilly hears footsteps walking to the back of the classroom.  “I don’t think she’s back there either, Misha…” Lilly says as she feels a desk shift and a moan from Rin.   “WAHAHA I know that silly Lilly!!~” as Misha takes Lilly’s right arm in her left and leads her down a clump of stairs. “Maybe she’s in her room, let’s try there next!!” Lilly hears the stomp stomp stomp of Misha’s feet at she leads her out of the building towards the dorms. “Even her feet are loud” she groans internally.   “We’re almost here!!” Misha wails” and as they turn the corner Misha yells as to wake up the other side of the world, “SHICCAN! SHICCAN!  WHAHAHAHA~~ WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!!!????”   “Misha I really don’t have time for this today, is Hanako th-“SHICCAAAAAN!!!” as Misha screams as she momentarily forgets her beloved Shiccan can’t actually hear her as she drags both of them to her best friend.” Lilly feels a breeze on her face from the rapid signing between the two and hears brief footsteps from nearby. She hears Misha say as she signs, “Don’t worry Shiccan, she can’t tell” as she signs to Shizune.   “Who can’t tell?” “Is Hanako there?” Lilly gently enquires.   “Wahaha! Nope, not here!!!” Misha says after a brief pause. She hears Shizune fold some paper and Misha once again grabs her right arm and bustles her away.   “Let’s try somewhere Hanako wouldn’t be and maybe she would be there!” Misha states with enthusiasm. “How about the track outside?!”   “Misha perhaps we should go back to the tea room,” Lilly tries to suggest.   “WAHAHAHA NO COME ON LET’S CHECK THE TRACK~~!   Lilly feels that they walk around something and go down some stairs and up some stairs and back down again. “Are we going to the track?” she finally asks. “YEP!!” Misha” replies still much too loudly. It feels like it’s taking way to long she thinks so she relays that thought to Misha. “WAHAHA!~ We’re just taking the long way around Lilly!!”   “Misha please. I have a really big day tomorrow and I really need to just speak with Hanako and try to relax. We really can’t be doing this right now.” Lilly says with a bit of desperation in her voice as she faintly loses her composure.  “Don’t worry silly Lilly we’ll find her!~~ Sometimes the longest way is the best way!” Misha says using her permanent outside voice. They finally arrive at the track a few minutes later and see Emi running.   “EMI!! OVER HERE!!~~” Misha yells over. Emi sprints to them. “What’s up guys?” She says as Lilly hears her heavy breathing and panting. She then feels Misha lean forward slightly. “Wahahahaha Hey Emi have you seen Hanako?”    “Nope, she doesn’t come to the track much,” Emi replies.   “OOK WELL SEE YOU LATER THEN!!~” Misha yells and quickly grabs Lilly and leads her away.   “Misha please, maybe you should just take me back home to my dorm.” Lilly pleadingly suggests.   “NOOO we need to find Hanako! You need to talk with her don’t you?” Misha says.   “Well she can wait until the morning at this point…”   “No come on Lilly! One more place! OH! OH! I know! How about the library!? She’s always there right Lilly?”   “Well, I suppose she is there often,” Lilly grudgingly admits. “Fine, we’ll check there and then you take me back home to my dorm.”   “WAHAHAHA~~ OK OK! LETS GOOO!~~”  Misha swoops her forward but it still takes a while before they get there. “Taking the long away again I see” Lilly thinks to herself.  They finally arrive at the two solid wooden doors of the library and Misha opens the door and waltzes in.   “HANAKOOO ARE YOU HERE!?” Misha yells with the social awareness of a teaspoon.   Yuuko visibly winces as she hears and sees and hears Misha. “Can you try to speak a little quieter Misha?” Yuuko asks in a soft voice.   “OK!” Misha replies in the loudest whisper Yuuko has ever heard.   “Have you seen Hanako?” Lilly asks in an equally annoyed and apologetic voice as she hears the flap of a paper.   “N-No…I don’t think I have” Yuuko replies.   “Oh ok” Lilly replies as the pair turns to leave. As they walk out they hear Yuuko behind them, locking the library doors and scurrying off. “Hm…wonder what she is in a hurry about?” Lilly ponders.   They start walking for a good ten minutes when Lilly asks, “Misha where are we going?”  “WAHAHA we’re going back to your dorm ~~!”   “Shouldn’t we have gotten there by now?” Lilly asks with a slight edge in her voice.   “Whahaha! We’re taking the long way again silly Lilly!”   Lilly, right there, remembers what she has tomorrow. Tomorrow. That dreaded word. The patience of all the saints combined and she..she just..can’t deal with Misha anymore.   “MISHA STOP. JUST STOP!” As Misha recoils from hearing Lilly angry. She’s never heard her speak above a mildly stern voice, let alone this.  Lilly gains some composure back and a little more than sternly states, “I REALLY need to get home. Now. Tell me where I am and I will get there myself.”   “Oh…ok” Misha says, more quietly than perhaps she’s ever been. “We’re in front of the gym now, the way your facing is the way to the dorms. I’m…sorry Lilly I didn’t mean to upset you.”   Lilly sighs so visibly even Misha can tell. “I’m sorry too Misha. I shouldn’t have raised my voice. Just, I’m  concerned about tomorrow.”   “That’s ok silly Lilly,” Misha says with a small smile Lilly can’t see. “I’ll see you later.”  Lilly walks in the direction of her dorm, bumps her foot on the stairs and walks along the edge feeling her way along the familiar path to her room. She walks down the hall way and feels for her door knob, but to her surprise it’s unlocked.   “SURPRIIISE!!” she hears from a chorus of voices.   “What”? She asks the voices?   “W-We wanted to surprise you and throw a party before…you know…t-tomorrow,” a familiar voice says.   “Hanako, all this is for…me?”   “Y-yes! It is. And everyone is here!,” as she hears once again the chorus of voices from Rin, Emi, Yuuko, and Hisao.   “SHICCAN and MISHA SAY SURPRISE TOO!~” As Misha peaks in through the door and says it loud enough for both of them.   “And we got you this,” Hanako says as she places a box in Lilly’s hands. “Rin p-painted it and used special paint so you can easily feel the words and design on it”  Lilly felt the outside of the box with her heart.   “And don’t forget the inside either,” Hisao chimed in. Lilly opened the box and felt several pieces of paper.   “What are these?” she asked.   “We each wrote what we loved about you most on them Lilly. It’s for you to take tomorrow” Hisao replied.  “I can’t read them though…” Lily said.   “WAHAHAHA~~ that’s the point! So tomorrow others will have to read them for you and know how awesome you are!”   “Thank you all so much…I don’t know what to say,” as tears started to form in her eyes. “And I’m once again sorry about before,” as she turned in the direction of Misha’s voice.   “WHAHAHA That’s ok silly Lilly! Just remember that sometimes the longest way around is the shortest way home!!~”  And they all spoke and laughed and signed deep into the night, and Lilly knew no matter what happened tomorrow, home was never far away."

katawashoujo,39wsyr,goofyomnivore,2,Tue Jun 16 00:44:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm glad you liked it. (: I also hope I wasn't too subtle with portraying that Misha was giving everyone a note as she met them to tell them about party, while simultaneously keeping Lilly busy and out of her room while Hanako/Hisao/Shizune made the other preparations."
katawashoujo,39wsyr,FollowThePact,2,Tue Jun 16 02:31:38 2015 UTC,"Ah shit, I must have completely missed the note bit, but that would make more sense. Ill be honest that I thought you were just shoehorning characters in for the sake of getting to write them. The leading on a wild goose chase thing though definitely came through. Ill also be honest that it wasnt quite what I had in mind, but I really do like how you handled it. Part of the fun of coming up with the prompts is seeing how you guys interpret it, so its great to see the unexpected."
katawashoujo,39wsyr,superhanson2,2,Tue Jun 16 02:36:45 2015 UTC,"I really liked it! I thought that Misha's silliness was a bit over the top at first, but it does help make you suspicious that something is going on.  Good job! I thought the second prompt was a lot harder, as Lilly and Misha don't seem like two characters that go together. You did a good job in that regard. :)"

katawashoujo,39wsyr,Dannflor,3,Wed Jun 17 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"Prompt 1:  Lilly holds my arm tighter whenever the wind blows. She's always so sensitive. And that's what I like about her. I've grown addicted to being close to her. Her touch, her body heat. The winter has been memorable, hanging out with Lilly and Hanako. Some of the most memorable things happened to me this year. Crazy how this one year at Yamaku has blown out anything at my old school.   The summer was pretty memorable. After the...airport incident, Lilly stayed back with me for a while. It was just us two, since Hanako went travelling. And those several days of just us were pretty great, just what we both wanted.   Eventually, we had to answer to Lilly's parents. I don't know what she said to them, but somehow she convinced them to let me visit. She's not moving back of course, and ow her parents had to meet the person that was the reason why. I remember being really nervous. But it turned out alright, her parents showed no signs of animosity.  Scotland was pretty nice. Karla was really friendly, letting me stay there, conversing with me in Japanese, and cooking for me. Lilly's dad seemed a little stress. Probably because the man who had sex with his daughter and convinced her not to move back in was staying there. Lily tells me he was just busy with work though.  We went swimming near a beach. Lilly couldn't go off on her own, but I still enjoyed it. We went every few days since it was so close. She wore her swimsuit on wrong the first day, and neither me nor Akira spoke up. I would've said something, but Akira told me not to say anything for a prank. We were there a whole, sunny afternoon. By the time we got back, Lilly's mom noticed her tan lines. Lilly didn't know what was going on, but she knew it was prank by the way Akira was scolded.   We got back and reunited with Hanako when summer was close to an end. Finally things returned to the natural order. Fall passed quick as me and Lilly continued our relationship. Hanako didn't mind being a third wheel, but eventually she started getting busier. She joined the journalism club, she started taking photos more. She even took an interest in Middle-eastern culture. She even got a penpal from someone from Iraq who was interested in coming to Japan. I didn't eve know someone so far away would be interested in our humble country.   Hanako never completely faded out from our lives. There was one event that was deeply concerning. Apparently, Hanako took more pills than she was supposed to one day, and I doubt it was by accident. Hanako seemed so happy. Just shows you that you never really know people even when you think you do. Lilly was heart broken, I remember her barely keeping the tears in as she was telling me, but Hanako recovered. She actually caught up in her studies real quick, but at the expense of our company.  It's winter now. Hanako has drifted a little, but me and Lilly are going to hangout with her tonight. We're going to an arcade, which Hanako should like. It's cold, but I don't think Hanako would mind. We walk in the winter cold to the gates, where Hanako and Akira are going to meet up with us.   As we approach the gates with both of them barely visible, Lilly stops me. I look at her and ask her whats wrong. She starts fading away. I panic, as I've never seen something like this before. Let alone to the woman I love. I yell out for help. Hanako and Akira should have heard, but they don't respond. They just stand there infact, not responding and looking at us.   Lilly looks at me, happily. As if she wanted this. I ask what's going on to her as if she knew. She doesn't respond and fades away like dust in the wind. I stand there shaking. The woman who I love just faded from my life. Perhaps this was destined. She never should have stayed back anyways. Had I not almost died, she probably would've left.   Is this symbolic? My thoughts are interrupted by a loud beeping in the sky. It sounds like a heart monitor. My eyes open. Where am I? Apparently that was just a bad dream. It was all a dream.....a fiction created by the mind. Apparently I'm at the hospital. I look at the clock. Noon....."
katawashoujo,39wsyr,superhanson2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:58:30 2015 UTC,Interesting interpretation of the prompt. I would recommend that you take a little more care editing the piece and checking for spelling and grammatical errors. I like the epilogue feel of it though.

katawashoujo,39wsyr,Dannflor,4,Tue Jun 16 07:18:27 2015 UTC,"Wait, so we write some pieces and then the others fulfill it or we do single and independent mini-one shots? Dw, I'll modify this post when I get to actually write down something  Edit: here is what I've wrote! (note: English is not my main language and I don't claim to be the best at it, so please don't hurt me ç_ç)  [Prompt 1]     It has been almost a year, yet some things never truly change. During this year I had so many events that shaped my life, but I feel like there's one single immovable object in my mind that keeps me from embracing this new life. The stars above make me feel somewhat safe, in contrast to the cold breeze that's almost freezing my bones. The only thing I can do is endure this cold embrace and try not to fall victim to mother Nature. Now that I think about it, how could I be hurt by her? I mean, not only I'm spending my vacation on my parents place, but I am also enjoying this time with the love of my life. Her long dark hair blends with the night, almost making her look like something nature itself would create. Yet, the combination of this winter's night and the color of her hair make me feel uncomfortable. This memory almost comes to my mind out of instinct, without me noticing it, and so making my body rigid out of the sheer pain that I feel by remembering this event. I also see long and dark hair on a winter's day, but this time these are my girlfriends locks of hair, but of a ghost of my past that haunts me to this day. Her name was Iwanako. It almost feels like as her name became the representation of my history then a real person itself, which is very strange now that I think of it. Her confession, the words that echo in my head to this day remember me that I'm no longer normal, I don't live the life of every other human and that I will no longer enjoy the fine things in life that before that accident were so normal to me. I never thought about how lucky I was, until the moment I woke up after the pain in my chest that followed me hearing her words. Those soft and candid words that told me how much she likes me. I know that I should feel happy about this, yet I can't. Maybe that's because I can't see her anymore as a person I would love, but instead I see her as the harbinger of the biggest change of my life. For weeks I've been thinking that she cursed me with her confession, but when I met Hanako everything changed. I had a purpose in life and when we both confessed to each other, we both knew that we've found our paths. As I keep talking to myself, I feel a light tug on my arm that teleports my mind back to the real world. It seems that she noticed my nervousness and wanted my attention, maybe to comfort me? It looks like it, given the look in her eyes. A look filled with love, worry but that at the same time makes me feel at peace with myself. The expression in those eyes makes me feel at home and it reminds me why I love her so much. No longer I feel remorse nor am I sad about what happened a year ago. As I put an arm on her shoulders, in order to draw her closer to me, I know that as long as I'm with Hana I know that nothing can go wrong and if it does, we know that we can count on each other. The biting cold of the night no longer stings, since I feel the warmth that accompanied me since that day in the park. The frigid breeze no longer exists for me, since with this girl I can face even the coldest nights. All we need is each other, and as long as this remains true, nothing else matters."
katawashoujo,39wsyr,Dannflor,2,Wed Jun 17 03:51:44 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot. I think you should try and format it a little better to break it up into the composite ideas though. Personally, Im not a huge fan of unbroken first person writing, but a lot of that has to do with me not liking the word ""I"" being repeated so many times."
katawashoujo,39wsyr,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"You're right about the format, but it was something I did in less then 40 minutes, so I didn't give too much thought into formatting it. As far as the ""I""'s go, I can see that not being everyone's cup of tea, tho I feel like if used correctly it adds a lot to the pacing of the fanfiction. I don't say I used them well, since I probably used them too much as you said, but let's say that is something I'm working on. I also wanna say thank you for reading it and wow, I'm surprised that you liked it a lot! I honestly thought it would be very mediocre x:"

katawashoujo,39x2hh,FrankFalconi,6,Mon Jun 15 14:34:45 2015 UTC,"100%er here.  It's a solid game. A very solid game. It's not spectacular, but I'd say it's worth the sale price. Why?  The Good  IMHHW benefits from several things, first of all is its uniqueness. I can't really say I know of any other works of fiction that even mention Soaring, let alone focus on it as a primary plot element. It's a novel and refreshing approach to the ""SoL school club"" trope and, for the most part, it manages to tie the plot together in a unique fashion. As an added benefit, if you didn't know a thing about glider flight before now, you will after finishing the game - information is mentioned, both in offhanded and infodump form, throughout the main and branch routes.  Speaking of branch routes, the characters are - while somewhat archetypal at their most basic design - fairly memorable in their own right. The three primaries (Kotori, Ageha, Amane) have fairly well written routes, and Kotori in particular will probably tickle your Katawa Shoujo fancy.  The art is goddamn fantastic. Some of the 3D animated sequences leave a bit to be desired, but the rest, from sprites to CGs, are top-tier quality. The music, as well, is pretty good - Precious Wing~, the main theme, is of particular note, in both its own sound and its use throughout the story.  Finally, and this might just be my bias as a glider pilot, but the story manages to perfectly convey a lot of the joys of flight. The entire plot revolves around the Gliding Club's effort to get their plane into the air, despite obstacles in the plane, the authorities around them, and their own capabilities. The payoff, on top of that, manages to ace the feeling of why people would go to such lengths to get into the air.  The Bad  The official English version is shit. Like, Google Engrish shit. Step #1 for this game is downloading the Restoration Patch (link). Note that this requires a bit of finagling, such as changing your system locale to Japanese, though if you play many VNs you'll run into that eventually. Important things the Restoration Patch brings back:   Dirty jokes. There's a ton of sexually-undertoned humor, especially in Ageha's banter (moreso in her route), which is pretty damn funny - props to the translators. The Steam/Official version cuts it entirely, because morals.  H-scenes. While most of them are fanservice, a few of them are actually character-development relevant. And, y'know, most of 'em are really sweet and heartwarming and stuff.   Remember what I said about getting to know about glider flight? Well, that's gonna happen whether you want to or not - a lot of the info, while accurate, is presented as infodumps. While it's interesting the first time through, it gets very old, very quickly, especially as you do replays - which you will, since a lot of the common route decisions straddle the parts with the worst infodumps.  The other bad side is Asa and Yoru who, while interesting characters in their own right, as romantic options feel forced. On top of the whole ""they look like kids but no really they're 18"" thing, their overall personalities don't really mesh well to the whole ""Main Character, master of seduction"" thing. There's even an element of satire in their route where one of the NG+ endings lampshades it if you try to go for a harem ending with both twins, which I feel could be applied to both their routes - ""You're going after the loli genius girls? Really?"" The game could've done without it.  tl;dr  It's good. Get the fan translation patch, because the official is shit and takes out a lot of content, sexual and not. 8.5/10 overall, very much worth regular price, let alone sale price.    Oh, and avoid the mobile port at all costs. It's terribad and pay to win, if that's possible for a goddamn VN."

The common route take an extremely long time, but if you ask me it does so while providing loads of information about the protagonist as well as the characters in general, so it isn't really boring or skip-worthy. It's just long. (In fact if you want to know anything about the characters I recommend not skipping it at all, it's got hilarious moments in it). The game is dark. Like, really dark. I played through every route, and let me tell you, if Katawa Shoujo made you cry you should be prepared to be catatonic by the end of Grisaia. The amount of screwed up stuff that happens in this visual novel is pretty immense.   Overall it's an amazing visual novel and is by far my favorite at the moment."

katawashoujo,39x2hh,SketchingScars,2,Mon Jun 15 14:57:42 2015 UTC,"It's not really a bad thing, the story and routes for each girl just touch on a lot of extremely graphic and traumatizing material, such as describing people having limbs severed, psychotic breaks, drug overdoses, etc. These types of things and more (and sometimes much worse) happen to the characters within the visual novel.  I find it to be an extremely good story, it's just that it isn't really for people who would think that something like Game of Thrones ""goes too far,"" with their character deaths, because Grisaia can be worse.  EDIT: After reading another post you wrote I now know more along the lines of what you're asking, and the answer is this: It will pretty much destroy you on the feels level, with the potential to be far worse than Katawa Shoujo on many levels."

Michiru was my first, and she surprised me, as she was such a joke character and then flips the serious switch! Grisaia is always recommended, and for good reason."

katawashoujo,39x2hh,Joby05,4,Tue Jun 16 22:15:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Kono Oozora ni, Tsubasa wo Hirogete was one of the next VNs I was planning to get after finishing Majikoi. I think it has a lot of promise and you should really like it. One thing to keep in mind is that the Steam version is rated 12+ and to me that's bullshit. I won't get anything from steam unless someone has released a ""patch"" to un-censor the game (and VERY rarely even then). I generally think you're better off getting the original source material and not the steam versions (in pretty much all cases). Hope this helps!"
katawashoujo,39x2hh,maverik7773,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:55:07 2015 UTC,"I like Steam just because I don't have to pay taxes (because of the country I am from), so that a $5 game I usually get it for $3.5~4, which is nice. Will definitely check those out, thanks"

Just one question though, is it heavy on the feels? I was kinda looking for a lighter VN that doesn't leave my crying like a little boy whose dog just died"
katawashoujo,39x2hh,Joby05,2,Mon Jun 15 14:43:24 2015 UTC,"It has some feels, but nowhere near the level of feels as KS. Although I have only read the Kotori route, and no others. I imagine that maybe Ageha would be a little more feelsy but I am in the middle of like 4 other things right now so I won't be getting to it for a while. Also, I should note: I did get the Fan Restoration Patch. For, y'know, reasons... and I just thought it was stupid to wear a towel IN the bathtub. Also, just a heads up, unless the group deving the Fan Restoration Patch updated it, It WILL NOT work with the steam version. Trust me, I tried. I had to get my version from * ahem * other sources. Yar, har, fidde dee dee  Edit: formatting."

katawashoujo,39v3h1,phantominthebrain,4,Mon Jun 15 08:42:42 2015 UTC,"I remember the difference by looking at the far right line - if it is ""tsu"", the stroke should be going down so the bottom part will be pointy. As for ""shi"", it's the opposite way, so the top will be pointy. I tend to add a little upwards tick at the bottom of the long line for ""shi"" to make it easier to see too.  Also for ""tsu"" the two little lines should be closer to vertical lines rather than vertical, while for ""shi"" it is more horizontal.  TL;DR - カタカナめんどくせえ～."

What do you feel differentiates you from similar stories that makes you unique? Is it just the plot or do you have specific storytelling elements that you think make you more unique?
katawashoujo,39q0id,OneManArmy77,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:31:55 2015 UTC,"More than anything, I think it's our production values. My personal opinion is that the visuals are the most important part of a VN, followed by the writing. I'll read through a mediocre story if it's written well and presented well, personally. So strong writers and strong artists were our biggest focuses when building a team/finding replacements. I do think that our setting and story is fairly unique too; more than people would expect from reading our synopses. But yeah, ultimately I hope it's our production values that really set us apart."

What really got me into KS was how great the writing was; not only did each character have their own personality, but their character genuinely felt real.  I, personally, don't mind paying a bit of money for a good read / entertainment. If it means taking 1.5 years (it seems the deadline is December 2016 if I'm not mistaken) instead of 5 years, I'm all for it.  If Act 1 sells me, you can definitely expect another backer.

katawashoujo,39q0id,Joby05,4,Sat Jun 13 23:13:09 2015 UTC,"Starting in early 2012, I noticed more English speaking people planning to create ambitious visual novels. Unfortunately, a large number of these projects have been quietly cancelled. In my opinion, this is a result of several factors, such as...   The scope is too large, and people can not commit to writing that much Communication difficulties Time management issues ""Freeware problem"" of not being able to compensate people for their work   If The Human Reignition Project needs a Kickstarter in order to get finished, I understand. Also, I believe that more visual novels might benefit from being sold as indie games.  As of this writing, Missing Stars, Work in Progress, and Starswirl Academy are alive and updating. A few others still have dedicated websites, but no longer seem to be active. The Love Despite site is up, but the project was cancelled earlier this year. American Jurassic stopped updating in 2013, and the boy x girl story Con Amore seemingly died in 2014."

I'm curious how the whole project will play out, since for what I've read here, I agree with your opinion on VNs (the answer to /u/OneManArmy77 ).

katawashoujo,39o2g6,aflyingfatman,10,Sat Jun 13 03:40:04 2015 UTC,"There isn't and never will be...  Katawa Shoujo was a project of love and that's why it's so different.  Alot of VNs are made for fans and money. And often include alot of fan service and cringy/shoddy writing.  KS isn't that way though thankfully, it was just a project made by fans of the VN genre from all over the world.   They loved the genre so much that they wanted to make an exceptionally good VN, And they did.  The only thing driving them was the passion/love for the project and even that ended up taking 5 years of their lives. I've said it before and I'll say it again.  There was just...a fire/spark with KS that simply can't be recreated. Even by 4LS themselves. Sadly KS was just destined to be a one hit wonder but it's amazing for that fact.  I hate that alot of people write off KS as ""Babbys first VN"" because that discredits the game and the people who worked on it, as well as the people this game has touched.   They did an amazing job creating an extremely immersive story/world with wonderful art, sprites and music. With just a picture as source material from the back pages of some Doujin.  KS definitely has a....special aura about it that just isn't there with alot of other VN's.  It's not only a great VN but it always changes a person in some way shape or form, always.   It doesn't matter what girl you pick as your Waifu...in the end you are changed for the better. It makes you a better person (I'd like to believe)  There's so many stories of people running more because of Emi, Or Hanako's route making a person kick their life into gear or a million other examples. It's always amazing to read.  KS will always be with me...not only will I keep it on about 600 external hard-drives, I will search to the end of the earth for that bloody hard copy.  /rant  https://www.reddit.com/r/katawashoujo/comments/2r9zje/3_years_of_katawa_shoujo/cndxvln?context=3 If you enjoy reading another paragraph :S"

I'm not sure this makes any sense to me. Of course most VNs are made for money, they are a gaming type medium. Not sure why that means that they aren't good? Also, not to be a dick but it doesn't sound like you've read very many other VNs. I like KS... a LOT. I've read a fair number of other VNs and other than translation issues I feel like most of them are written at least as well as KS."
katawashoujo,39o2g6,Joby05,2,Sat Jun 13 10:36:52 2015 UTC,"Note the qualifier ""often"".  At any rate, I don't think it can be denied that something made purely out of love of the project has a fundamentally different quality from something that is made because that's the job of those who made it (people who may or may not love the project)."
katawashoujo,39o2g6,Atario,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:33:18 2015 UTC,"I haven't found that to the the case often either. In fact, rarely have a read a VN since KS and thought how KS was way better. It is a great VN, but sometimes you have to appreciate a novice team can only do so much. It just feels close minded to say KS is the best without seeing what is out there."
katawashoujo,39o2g6,Joby05,-1,Sat Jun 13 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for him, but look at this."
katawashoujo,39o2g6,TheDwarfLard,5,Sat Jun 13 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"First off never assume, It makes you look like an ass.  I've read quite a few VNs even after KS.  Katawa Shoujo  Nekopara  Narcissu  If My Heart Had Wings  Go Go Nippon  Hell...even watched a few LPs of a few VNs like   Tokyo School Life  Deiz  and a few Hatsune Miku/Rin Kagamine VNs.  and many more to add to my list  Steins Gate  Clannad  Fate/Stay Night etc  I've never claimed KS was the best. Because it's not, nothing is. But to ME KS is as perfect as it can get.  And what I meant by ""Most are made for money""...  Is that....yes I realize people want money, I'm not dense. It's a gaming medium therefore they can charge for them as they should...It's just a shame that most aren't as quality as one would expect...  cough cough Sakura series  And often they are just incredibly fan servicey, have sex/animated sex scenes just to...have them, they don't advance the story they are just used to sell the game itself.  It's another 50/50 thing because a great bunch do have great writing, but at the same time that other 50 has atrocious writing.  I'm simply saying KS is a special case because when you look at it, You ALWAYS hear a story of how it changed a persons life or helped a person through something.  You don't often see people say ""Nekopara changed my life for the better"" or ""Go Go Nippon made me kick my life into gear"" etc and so on.   KS is just rooted in more...reality than a large margin of VNs I believe, and that's why it's SUPER relateable and why it can hit home to some people.   You see it here on the sub-reddit for example, You have some people who are legally blind like Kenji! Or some who are deaf like Shizune.  Perhaps I exaggerated a bit to make a point I will admit. But that doesn't mean I'm entirely wrong on it either."
katawashoujo,39o2g6,Sohtak,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:35:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not denying what you're saying. KS is a solid piece and I am still a huge fan. I think that in some ways it built off of a lot of the greats and used all of their groundwork to pave the way. It was also written specifically to be relatable and to give an emotional impact, whereas a lot of other VNs were made to tell a specific story without necessarily eliciting the same emotional responses. There are plenty of VNs that have no H-scenes at all that tell nice and compelling stories.  I think really when you said this is when I had to disagree:   Alot of VNs are made for fans and money. And often include alot of fan service and cringy/shoddy writing.   I really haven't seen that in most of the VNs that I've read. I guess I would say that it is OK to bring up KS but I would try not to bring down the medium as a whole (we already get a bad enough rep with our ""porno games"" as it is without our own community pushing the stereotype."
katawashoujo,39o2g6,Joby05,0,Sat Jun 13 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though KS wasn't MEANT to be relateable it just happened to be that way.   I seriously doubt 4LS went ""We should make a game about people with disabilities so people with disabilities and or similar issues can relate to it!""   It just happened that end up that way.  You can see in any video interview with the writers or on the KS forums themselves. Even the Devs themselves are surprised at how often a certain route or piece of music affects someone.   Even Aura and Cpl_Crud (Cam O'Neil) themselves posted this not too long ago on twitter  http://i.imgur.com/ql8PTfN.png  I don't think they planned ANYTHING with KS other than KS itself.  And that stereotype isn't going to go anytime soon when people keep buying into games like Hunniepop and the Sakura seires going ""LOL CREEPY ANIME STUFF""  Once people stop buying into that mindset and Devs realize it won't sell? VNs can get more credit as a genre.  ((Hunniepop isn't TECHNICALLY a VN but it's defined as it for some reason...))"
katawashoujo,39o2g6,Sohtak,0,Sat Jun 13 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"This is a bit silly, there are a lot of amazing visual novels out there, and KS is not special, or even the best. It is good, but its not the end-all be-all."
katawashoujo,39o2g6,Parzivus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:37:20 2015 UTC,"Could be wrong, but I don't think he's saying KS is undeniably the best VN ever. It's more that because it's touched and affected so many lives (AFAIK, not many other VNs do this in high numbers?), that's what could set it apart. And I believe on a personal level, it was special to him."
katawashoujo,39o2g6,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:54:32 2015 UTC,"Well that's fair. The one thing is that a lot of people play KS and then stop with VNs, right?"
katawashoujo,39o2g6,Joby05,0,Sat Jun 13 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"For some, yes. If other VNs don't interest them, then that should be fine."
katawashoujo,39o2g6,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"True, but I don't think it is fair to make broad generalizations about the medium without being at least semi well versed."
katawashoujo,39o2g6,Joby05,0,Sat Jun 13 16:59:41 2015 UTC,"People could easily read Grisaia no Kajitsu or Clannad and come to the conclusion that Katawa Shoujo is 'better.'  For many others, those VNs are 'better' in some ways (or many ways), but I highly doubt KS is topped by the 'great' VNs in every single way imaginable.    There was just...a fire/spark with KS that simply can't be recreated.   He's not wrong in saying that. It may not make KS any better than it is, but if you were to add everything up, you likely wouldn't find another VN so similar to it. A game/book/film/VN can feel like something else (in this case, another VN feels like KS), but it doesn't necessarily 'play' like it (or vice versa).   From what I've heard, KS fluctuates from between average to a bit above average. Grisaia no Kajitsu and Clannad often seem to come much higher up on the list. Yet, not everyone would agree with that. Maybe there's a person that says KS was a great VN (I dunno, like a 90/100?), but they abhorred Clannad for reason x, y, or z.   ... I don't think it is fair to make broad generalizations about the medium without being at least semi well versed.   Similarly, first impressions do this, but just in a more limited way (one specific game, book, film, etc.). A person plays a game for around 30 minutes and writes down or says their thoughts and it's their first impression. The first 30 minutes could be absolutely awful according to them, so they stopped playing. However, if they kept playing, they'd see the rest of the game is at least okay, if not pretty good.    Alot of VNs are made for fans and money. And often include alot of fan service and cringy/shoddy writing.   Some are, yes. Perhaps 'a lot' is a bit of an exaggeration. I've seen a project with tons of potential just fall apart because they couldn't handle money very well. As an example, look at the Winged Cloud games (Sakura Spirit, Sakura Angels, etc.): They aren't known for their writing and I've seen enough of it to know it's not wonderful (perhaps not bad, though), but pretty much their entire point is fan service. Additionally, all of those games cost at least a few USD (or equivalent of whatever currency).  Edit: Lastly, as far as I know, he never said all VNs were terrible in comparison to KS. As I said, perhaps a lot was an exaggeration, but the idea of it has merit."

I love how immersive the VN is and think the writing is very good for what it achieves! I never got into VNs much until Katawa Shoujo, but one thing I liked was how similar it felt to a manga/anime, in that the routes didn't have too many choices sometimes, and it felt like I was observing, not living."

It uses unusual plot devices to tell the story of a relationship between two girls. As far as I can tell, the person who wrote it hasn't created any other stories in the media format since 2002.  I've been active in anime-manga fandom since 1998, and have watched it changed over the years. There are a number of stories which belong to a specific era, such as...   Fist of the North Star: Post apocalypse story that reflected the 1980s fear of nuclear war, as well as a fascination with Mad Max and Bruce Lee. Bubblegum Crisis: A riff on movies including Streets of Fire and Blade Runner. It's a science fiction story that does not involve a society meltdown, but its aesthetics are tied to the 1980s.  Sailor Moon: It fused '80s magical girls with superhero combat shows. Because it was influential, it's difficult to separate the two genres now. A lot of the story's plot points involved a video arcade, which seems rather dated now."

katawashoujo,39lro0,SenSenSen,3,Fri Jun 12 17:46:31 2015 UTC,Theres always Roll20.net I guess getting people to sign up isnt the problem. Having someone organize and contact everyone is.
katawashoujo,39lro0,SenSenSen,3,Fri Jun 12 17:48:10 2015 UTC,"I would like to post a thread on it but sense it isn't related to KS I would get banned, Maybe I could set up a poll asking who wants to sign up, what time is good, and how long to play ect. Also, Roll20.net looks like it would work well."
katawashoujo,39lro0,ChihuahuaGod,3,Fri Jun 12 18:06:22 2015 UTC,Sounds good to me.
katawashoujo,39lro0,aflyingfatman,3,Fri Jun 12 18:08:17 2015 UTC,Sounds good to me.
katawashoujo,39lro0,thatJainaGirl,2,Fri Jun 12 18:19:36 2015 UTC,I think that's be pretty fun. Any idea what edition?
katawashoujo,39lro0,Parzivus,2,Fri Jun 12 20:30:59 2015 UTC,5th Edition is love.
katawashoujo,39lro0,aflyingfatman,2,Fri Jun 12 20:54:08 2015 UTC,As an owner of several editions: anything but fourth.
katawashoujo,39lro0,Gore_Lily,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:36:59 2015 UTC,I don't know why everyone hates 4e so much.
katawashoujo,39lro0,aflyingfatman,2,Sat Jun 13 00:34:56 2015 UTC,"It's a decent game in it's own right, but to me and a lot of people I play with, it just doesn't feel like D&D. It felt like they wanted to trim back on the amount of detail from 3.5, but went too far and turned it into more of a miniatures strategy game rather than an RPG. If that's what you're into, awesome! It's just too different for people that spent a lot of time with things like AD&D, 3.5 or Pathfinder.   So far I think 5E strikes a much better balance between the sometimes overwhelming freedom of 3.5 and the more focused, almost guided progression of 4E."
katawashoujo,39lro0,Gore_Lily,2,Sat Jun 13 00:47:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 4e does feel much more combat oriented to the little bits of 5e that I've played. I just don't have a lot of experience with other editions to really notice the ""not like D&D"" feel. That being said, in games I've played in and DM'd, we'd use a lot more Theatre of the Mind and leave little or nothing on tabletop, so it's always felt like simple RPG to me."
katawashoujo,39lro0,Parzivus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:08:02 2015 UTC,"If you're enjoying 4E, that's great. The best system is always the one you have the most fun with. I started playing 3.5 nearly a decade ago and is still the game I've spent by far the most time with, so it's just hard for me to compare any RPG to anything else.  One moment that really defines my experience with 4E was my first session playing with a couple friends that had never played D&D before. During character creation, one of the guys was looking over the powers and characters roles when he said ""Oh, so it's just like WoW."" That's the biggest thing that stuck out to me: it seemed like the tabletop adaptation of a video game adaptation of a tabletop RPG, know what I mean?  If you get the chance to play something like Dungeon World, FATE, or more 5E, definitely give them a try. It's always cool to mess around with new systems."
katawashoujo,39lro0,thatJainaGirl,2,Sat Jun 13 01:52:21 2015 UTC,It takes ages to do combat and turns it into more of a wargame.
katawashoujo,39lro0,Tynaiden,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:03:21 2015 UTC,"I always play on roll20. Add me to the list of players if you're going to DM! We mentioned this in the last free talk thread, but we didn't have a DM."

katawashoujo,39lro0,Atario,2,Fri Jun 12 18:24:27 2015 UTC,"History is one of those you just have to study for. Math is a little easier to guess if the test is multiple choice, but its so difficult. Squeezed by with an 80 in algebra/geometry this year, and it was a hell of a class."
katawashoujo,39lro0,MasterlessAshenMyles,6,Fri Jun 12 23:54:55 2015 UTC,"I can now officially play Painful History on the piano. After just earlier today finally working out a section that had given me trouble before. Aiming to learn some more pieces from the KS soundtrack. I swear I've had the soundtrack on on a loop for the past couple of months. I don't think I could ever get tired of it.  I also have been trying to draw at least a little bit everyday. Drawing has never been something I've been any good at, it's always been something that I've sorta aspired to do in the back of my head, I've just never really put in the practice time to really get good at it. I finally decided I had enough, and for the past month of so I've just been drawing a little bit everyday. Sometimes little doodles, in various styles and projects, but the goal is to at least get in a little practice everyday. I'm still pretty bad, but I can definitely look at my work and say it's better than anything I could have done weeks ago."

If you haven't listened to the OST on some serious high-quality headphones, I highly encourage you to try it, and I mean that for everyone. The recording is outstanding, and I've never heard the music sound so alive. It really packs a whole new level of emotion into it.

katawashoujo,39jikh,Joby05,3,Fri Jun 12 04:06:26 2015 UTC,"I don't really have experience with other VN sex scenes. However, I do think Katawa Shoujo's are a fair enough length to get across the point of the way the two characters are interacting, adds a bit of genuine early relationship points, and some candy.  Overall, I would think they are a bit tame but pretty sure that's kind of the point since the main focus is the disabled ladies and the challenges of life others may not notice.  Then again, I probably wouldn't care for a 20 minute H-scene in a VN anyhow so that is a point to consider with my opinion stated. Well, honestly, unless of course the VN was billed as a ero deal. Far as I know there are not many people who watches a porno for the plot and romantic comedies for sex."
katawashoujo,39jikh,Tynaiden,3,Fri Jun 12 09:48:20 2015 UTC,Yep.  Eroge tend to go pretty far out there.  The sex scenes in KS are 100% purest realism vanilla by comparison.  And I'm fairly sure that was quite intentional by the devs.
katawashoujo,39jikh,Atario,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:52:15 2015 UTC,You're right... eroge is just any game with sex whereas nukige is a sex game.

I frequent /r/StardustCrusaders and something we do as a community thing is we have a few people writing ""Interactive Adventures."" This is kind of like your second idea, but a bit more controlled. The (singular) writer guides the story for a couple paragraphs, but stops and asks the users to ""input an action"", upon which people would comment and make a decision on what to do next. Out of the comments, a ""canon"" path is chosen and the story continues from there for a few more paragraphs and then asks for a choice. It is basically an interactive fanfic. Not so sure how well it could translate to Katawa Shoujo, but just a thought.  Big fan of the other two ideas btw."

katawashoujo,39euio,CokeFryChezbrgr,6,Thu Jun 11 06:44:44 2015 UTC,"For people who want to write a visual novel, here is my advice:   Remember, it's your story. Create what you want to write. Read TVTropes' article So You Want to Make a VN. The site has other articles that might be useful for creators, but keep in mind that it's also a notorious time sink. Carefully consider how much time and effort you can dedicate. Especially if you want to release the final product as freeware. Likewise, think about the scope of your project. Ask yourself how many choices, endings, and major characters it will have. Give yourself deadlines. If you choose to write a specific amount of story in a month, that can be helpful. It might help make sure the project does not go on indefinite hiatus. If you need advice or assistance, then ask politely. Back up your work routinely. Make sure it won't get lost forever if your computer has technical problems. Remember that visual novels don't have to be equated with school-based love polygon stories. If you would rather write about a space marine going through a bitter divorce (to use a random idea), then feel free to do so."

katawashoujo,39euio,ApplicableSongLyric,2,Fri Jun 12 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"A girl who has proactive amnesia, she has extreme difficulty remembering new things; thus it's hard for her to make friends or let alone develop a relationship.

Despite her short comings and the fact that she can't make memories, she can still learn and is one of the top students at [school name here].   (I want to say that she has a diary so can ""refresh"" her memory, but that's already taken by this anime: One Week Friends"
katawashoujo,39euio,okizzle,2,Thu Jun 11 15:02:45 2015 UTC,It's going to be extremely hard.
katawashoujo,39euio,FollowThePact,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"It's going to be extremely hard.   Yeah, this.  Tackling mental illness would require an extremely delicate hand, as well as a really strong working knowledge of the subject that I don't even think most psychologists have.     As someone who understands mental illness much better than the general population, and who likes to write--if someone tasked me with writing a story like this, I would have a really hard time.       Not saying it would be impossible though, and actually could be quite brilliant.  If we look at KS, well, there's Rin, Hanako, and Kenji.  Even though Kenji's kind of a joke character, it would be cool seeing a more serious take on his life.  Hanako obviously is well-loved by fans because her problem, severe anxiety, is something almost all people can relate to at times. Rin, well, she's difficult to relate to for many people.  But then certain people like myself really enjoy her...     Actually, I could see this working--take the girls' traits and turn it up a notch, and you have the workings of a mental-illness story.     For instance, Emi shows some slight borderline personality disorder, friendly and charming, but pushes people away the moment she starts feeling emotionally vulnerable with them.  You could also work some PTSD in there.     Misha could easily be reworked into a character with bipolar disorder.       Take Shizune's controlling tendencies and turn it up a notch, and you could easily have a character with obsessive-compulsive disorder or Machiavellian personality disorder.     Lilly doesn't really have one, but you could give her severe depression that she masks through her facade of politeness and congeniality (Misha also fits here).  Depression's probably the easiest mental illness to write, since chances are strong that you or someone you've cared about has experienced it.     So yeah, I guess I could see it working.  Just would be really hard to pull off correctly."

We need to start tagging posts with character names so people can avoid them.  Edit: I'm not saying don't post Hanako. Just. Bring in a post flair system. Like /r/Kanmusu.

katawashoujo,39er9h,goanimals,2,Thu Jun 11 16:18:04 2015 UTC,"we all can see damn well 95% of this sub is all Hanako posts   Did a quick survey of the current top 200 posts by ""hot"" order:    Character Posts Percent    All/None/Other 87 43.5%   Hanako 37 18.5%   Lilly 27 13.5%   Misha 16 8.0%   Rin 14 7.0%   Emi 14 7.0%   Shizune 13 6.5%   Kenji 5 2.5%   Akira 4 2.0%   Yuuko 2 1.0%   Miki 2 1.0%   Molly 2 1.0%   Suzu 1 0.5%   Hideaki 1 0.5%   Rika 1 0.5%"

katawashoujo,39er9h,Blindweaponsfumbler,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:03:55 2015 UTC,I meant she makes up the majority of character posts. I was not being literal. Just an exaggeration or figure of speech or what have you. My point it she makes up the majority of posts at times and you showed that perfectly. Also thanks for going through posts like that and counting them up. Great work. /r/theydidthemath
katawashoujo,39er9h,goanimals,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:07:38 2015 UTC,"That's still not even a majority of character posts, only a plurality."
katawashoujo,39er9h,Atario,0,Fri Jun 12 08:27:40 2015 UTC,"Even with those approximate numbers, Hanako has the highest percentage for a single character, but in no way does she have the majority."
katawashoujo,39er9h,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:48:22 2015 UTC,"Eh....I don't think thats the best way to go about it. You know for a fact people would be complaining if Rin or Emi or Shizune or Lilly or Misha were posted as much.   That's the way it always is, complain about whats most commonly posted, popular. And its often skewed....all the girls are posted evenly but if you start counting each post...?  Of course it will seem like a certain girl is more posted than the other  I see all girls not just Hanako which people claim is the case"
katawashoujo,39er9h,Sohtak,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:34:37 2015 UTC,Read my edit.
katawashoujo,39er9h,goanimals,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:49:19 2015 UTC,"Many of them still fell relatively short. And I don't think nearly attempting to force non-Hanako posts is the way to do it either.  As is, if people wanted to see a large increase of... let's say Emi posts, then people would be posting more Emi (or catch onto doing that). If people loved Hanako as a character and her route, they should be able to post Hanako stuff (and even if they didn't, they still can).  Edit: While it's not conclusive, out of the last 50 posts, 3 (and one of them is sort of a stretch) are strictly Hanako. Beyond her character week and birthdays, I've never seen anywhere close to 95% of posts be Hanako.  It wouldn't surprise me if any other character had the same amount of attention, the group that liked her (or him) wouldn't say anything, while every other group would.  And fortunately (or unfortunately, depending how you want to look at it), we all need to share this sub."
katawashoujo,39er9h,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:23:40 2015 UTC,I'm not saying don't post Hanako. Just. Bring in a post flair system. Like /r/Kanmusu. You see by the posts a little flair mentioning the characters involved. So you can just look at the posts you like. Perfect. Especially for a sub like this where there is no little preview image. Or maybe just enable those little preview images.  In fact I'm gonna message dubious and see if he responds to those ideas.
katawashoujo,39er9h,goanimals,2,Thu Jun 11 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"I'm still not seeing the supposed 95% of posts being Hanako. Looking at the last 100 posts, around 15 (20 at the most) are Hanako related. The numbers certainly do change, but outside of the character week and birthdays, I'm not sure I've ever seen her posting rate get anywhere near that high. Look at the top tags on the Mishimmie. Hanako has a considerable lead over the other characters in terms of posts (some of which involve multiple characters). While that site doesn't have absolutely every image in existence, it should be relatively representative of the rates.  And yet, what if there's a really awesome piece of Hanako OC? People here say they love OC, but filtering out Hanako (or whichever character people decide to filter out) makes it so they won't see it. If I filtered out Emi for reason x,y, or z, and then I notice how there's little OC, there's a problem with what I did. Perhaps for a little while, the majority of OC posts are Emi related and because of what I did, I forcibly prevented myself from being able to see them.  Edit: Additionally, as has been pointed out, many of the other weeks fell short. By that point, there were some posts for whichever character's week (or semi-week) it was, but things more or less went back to normal. If people don't want to post Emi during her entire week, they simply won't. If they want to post Hanako instead, then they should be able to."
katawashoujo,39er9h,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:05:20 2015 UTC,Well of course if people always ignore posts with a certain flair they will miss things. But does that mean we shouldn't even have the option? No.  Today isn't an example. But there are some days in which there are only Hanako (except maybe 1 or 2) posts on the front page. Thats pretty annoying to me once it happens over and over. I love Hanako too. Shes great. Buts it like eating chocolate for every meal and only hearing people talk about chocolate. Eventually your like okay man there are other foods and I would like some.
katawashoujo,39er9h,goanimals,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"There hasn't been 100 posts in the last day. And for a sub of this size (actual size, not the sub number), the front page can easily cover two whole days at times. There was the Emi image from a few days ago that got around 300 points. Many recent posts are lucky to even get over 175 points. Hell, there was Anagram's fantastic Rin OC post that didn't even get 30 points.  The last 100 posts covers around a week. While the number certainly fluctuates, 15-20% of posts being Hanako (either entirely or largely her) leaves room for quite a lot of other posts. They aren't necessarily as popular, but if people believe there's a problem related to that, it's largely going to fall onto the people who like the posts. I could post the 'greatest' Rin image ever, but if no one votes on it, or even views it, then it's not going to get anywhere."
katawashoujo,39er9h,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:25:12 2015 UTC,95% was an exaggeration I get it. I was just making the point that Hanako makes up more posts than any other. This is why we need a post tagging system. I like Rin. Say Rin gets buried under posts. After viewing the front page some I filter out non Rin posts. And now I see the non-upvoted Rin posts that got buried. Replace with other girls as you wish. It will allow people to see buried posts if they are there. It would allow less popular images to still be seen by people who would like it.
katawashoujo,39er9h,goanimals,3,Thu Jun 11 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't. It sustained itself for Hanako, and partially for Lilly, but then it just fell short for the other characters. I don't remember a particularly large increase of OC, but could be wrong. The birthdays themselves should be sufficient."
katawashoujo,39er9h,TheDwarfLard,2,Thu Jun 11 06:16:14 2015 UTC,"Character weeks were a nice idea born of the ambition and energetic youth of last summer's subscriber surge. The first few character weeks went well since it was new and everyone was on board. Yes, the first choices for character weeks was a deciding factor in the initial success as well.   After the first few character weeks, /u/dubiousbro summed things up pretty nicely:   What I thought would happen: increased discussion about a particular character for that week.  What it feels like: degeneration into mindless shitposting of every image on your computer, drowning out real content.   During those weeks, which were one after another, people got tired of feeling like they couldn't post what they wanted to post because it would probably be lost in a sea of that week's character posts. This weariness even appeared when things got changed around for 3 day mini-weeks for side characters.  I won't even mention the drama that happened during the middle of the side character events.    The biggest issue facing any sort of character week/event is a division in the regular user base.  The veterans who are left from that summer/fall/winter remember what befell that idea and don't really want to try again. Those who missed it want to try it and don't have the character fatigue and drama llamas fresh in their memories to discourage them.    It's possible that if we were to experience another subscriber surge that the demand would be such as to inspire the fresh subscribers to do so on their own volition. However, those that wish to forge ahead should learn from the past and plan accordingly.     A few ideas from yours truly:   More than one person organizing the events. I don't know if /u/CokeFryChezbrgr ever burned out, but redundancy is not always a bad thing. Also, delegation is an effective tool. Try to limit image flooding. SERIOUSLY. Half of the drama resulted from people's posts being pushed off the front page from all the content. I should know because I flooded the front page with Shizune porn on the last day of her week, pushing all other posts off the page. Variety. It's hard to do on this board, if it isn't cute images it's porn images, maybe you get a wild fanfic or two late in the day. That said, the character weeks had some, but not enough in my opinion. Need a healthy mix of images, discussion, poems, fanfics and other miscellany to keep it fresh. FOR YAMAKU'S SAKE DON'T HAVE THE WEEKS/EVENTS ONE AFTER THE OTHER. Else people will feel like the first sentence."
katawashoujo,39er9h,Witcher_Gates,2,Fri Jun 12 00:17:12 2015 UTC,"No. Going full Pao on a subreddit by limiting what can be posted each week is a bad model.  In a more serious note, no, dont limit things, let things be more fluid by allowing anything (ks related) to be posted at any time, good things will be upvoted and bad things downvoted. no point trying to control it."

I liked the recent post where we were suppose to draw our favorite character in 5 minutes, that porduces a fun way of getting OC and gets the community to do something together.  If the week long events were strictly limited to OC, then I don't think there would be too many posts to warrant it being a week long.  Don't get me wrong I love when the community comes together and works on projects/events, but the Character Weeks didn't work out for us."

katawashoujo,39bgke,E_Ray_Bobo,3,Wed Jun 10 19:39:52 2015 UTC,Bro. You and I are like the same person.  http://www.reddit.com/r/katawashoujo/comments/34sckk/i_just_finished_my_first_run_of_this_i_think_need/  Just wait a bit and go back. It worked for me.
katawashoujo,39bgke,E_Ray_Bobo,3,Wed Jun 10 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"I played emis route first, it emotionally hurt me then i did hanakos route the one i wanted originally and got the bad ending it was the nail in my coffin crushed my heart and changed my opinion about how i approach people in real life actually  really loved it but the two stories crushed my soul."
katawashoujo,39bgke,E_Ray_Bobo,3,Wed Jun 10 19:56:27 2015 UTC,Literally just finished Hanako's arc 5 minutes ago. I am now an emotional wreck and I don't know if I will ever recover. Help me. Please.

katawashoujo,39bgke,Viaox,2,Tue Jun 16 13:38:36 2015 UTC,"If it can capture half the magic Katawa Shoujo did, I'll be happy. But that is no small task."
katawashoujo,39bgke,FrankFalconi,2,Tue Jun 16 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"Take a break. Everyone needs to after their first. How long it takes varies from person to person.  TBH, the game had a same effect on me. I played Hanako's route and was absolutely devastated emotionally. I then played Emi and Shizune's, which didn't have quite the same affect. Afterwards, I played Rin and Lilly's, which both affected me back on the same level Hanako's did.  Different routes will affect you differently. Go ahead and play another route, but take a break. Also, you probably don't want to play Rin's next, as seeing a lot of Emi after just finishing her route might be troublesome."
katawashoujo,39bgke,TheDwarfLard,2,Tue Jun 16 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"I feel ya man. The first time I played through one of the routes I wasn't able to play again for a month. It hits hard.   However when you're feeling up to it I suggest going with Lilly's route, it's a really nice read and the parts that hurt the most, are actually happy things in my opinion."

katawashoujo,39bgke,Sovietmustache,2,Wed Jun 10 23:26:22 2015 UTC,"You know I think that's one of my favorite parts of Emi's rt. The bad ending doesn't seem that bad by comparison to the others, but once you've played the good ending as well it has a sort of fridge horror effect."
katawashoujo,39bgke,Darkon-Kriv,2,Thu Jun 11 01:02:40 2015 UTC,You mean to tell me there is more than one ending?!
katawashoujo,39bgke,CGanimated1227,2,Thu Jun 11 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"Each route has at least two endings, with Hanako and Rin having three."
katawashoujo,39bgke,ChihuahuaGod,2,Thu Jun 11 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I will replay the story line from the bottom (even though it will hurt, the game is very enjoyable) just to find out"

katawashoujo,39bwbu,wqopreuitysaklfdhjg,11,Wed Jun 10 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"Emi, first girl best girl."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Acknown3,7,Wed Jun 10 19:44:08 2015 UTC,"Emi first/best reporting in.  I like how Emi cared for Hisao's health and all too, one of the many reasons I think Emi is best girl."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Dp24014,4,Thu Jun 11 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"I may not have an Emi flair, but I do agree Emi will always be best girl."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,FollowThePact,8,Thu Jun 11 03:38:54 2015 UTC,"Lilly is just my type of girl, of course i (like most players) failed miserably at running and ended up with Emi :P"
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Gaporigo,9,Wed Jun 10 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"Lilly was mine, and its been an absolute pleasure, and nightmare as well. I loved her story, maybe too much. On the bright side, a lot of good has come from it, so Im in a better place now."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,OneManArmy77,5,Wed Jun 10 19:46:41 2015 UTC,"Hanako. She also ended up being a very emotional route for me, I got very attached and took a while to recover.  My next two were Emi and Shizune. While I liked the routes, they didn't really come close to Hanako's for me.  Next I played Rin's, which affected me emotionally on about the same level Hanako's did.   And then yesterday I played Lilly's, which blew me away because I wasn't expecting much, but I'd put it on the same level of Rin and Hanako's.  For reference, my preference:  Hanako = Rin = Lilly > Emi > Shizune."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Dannflor,6,Wed Jun 10 19:06:52 2015 UTC,"On my first play through, I was really curious about Shizune.  I went through the first act on my own, but once I realized I wasn't seeing Shizune any further I actually restarted and used a guide to get to her first.  However, when I met Hanako, I knew she would be the girl I went for next.  I went through Shizunes route and rather enjoied it, but the ending felt to me like it was lacking something.  For whatever reason, I ended up doing exactly the opposite of my plan, instead opting to chase Emi, Lilly, and Rin before finishing the game with Hanako.  While I loved Lillys and Emis (sorry Rin fans), it really hyped me up for Hanakos.  Ended up being my favorite which was a bittersweet end to my Katawa Shoujo experience.  Hanako best girl"
katawashoujo,39bwbu,RobotA67,13,Wed Jun 10 23:26:20 2015 UTC,"Hanako. She caught my attention about as soon as possible (class 3-3 CG, most likely) and it never wavered throughout her story. If anything, I became more and more interested/involved with her as the route progressed. Looking at the thoughts of both Hisao and Hanako during that route proved to be an interesting experience for myself."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:56:03 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but is Hanako the only route you played? I never see you talk about any other character."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Parzivus,-1,Thu Jun 11 12:14:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I'm aware of the other characters/routes to a great enough degree. I can't discuss them in-depth, but I don't get lost in discussions."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:50:48 2015 UTC,"Huh. I wouldn't say you played the game wrong, but the other routes are so good. I would have missed a lot if I had stopped with Shizune, or if I had never gotten into the KS fanfic. Still, if you're happy with only having played that I'd be hard pressed to argue with you."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Parzivus,-1,Thu Jun 11 18:03:01 2015 UTC,"People have told me similar things (and sometimes more forcefully), but the other routes just don't interest me in the same way. Not saying there's anything wrong with them or the characters, I'm sure they're wonderful, but just not for me."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:05:35 2015 UTC,Sometimes it's not about it being as good. Just let read them atleast for the purpose of conversation. It's why I am going to read Rins...... Eventually.......... One of these days.......... Don't rush me!
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Darkon-Kriv,-1,Fri Jun 12 04:21:46 2015 UTC,"But if they don't interest me/it doesn't feel right/whatever other reason, I think I'm better off not reading the other routes. As I said, I know roughly what the others entail."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,TheDwarfLard,4,Fri Jun 12 04:55:31 2015 UTC,My first time playing I got the bad end.  The first actual route I did was Hanako.

katawashoujo,39bwbu,Atario,9,Thu Jun 11 00:51:33 2015 UTC,Meeting are on the roof.  BYOB.
katawashoujo,39bwbu,GGProfessor,4,Thu Jun 11 00:53:12 2015 UTC,"I was aiming for Rin, and got Emi instead. Lilly ended up being my favorite though."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Panory,3,Wed Jun 10 23:16:10 2015 UTC,Best girl here ^
katawashoujo,39bwbu,tempusers,3,Wed Jun 10 23:06:30 2015 UTC,First time I played through it I just made my choices and stuck with them. I got Lilly and have forever since been in love with her charcter.
katawashoujo,39bwbu,PingKiccolo,3,Wed Jun 10 23:07:00 2015 UTC,Lilly.
katawashoujo,39bwbu,LOTO-12,3,Wed Jun 10 23:26:15 2015 UTC,Emi. She was my first best girl and I loved her. But then I read all of the other routes. Now I love them all XD
katawashoujo,39bwbu,goobernuts19,2,Thu Jun 11 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"First one I got, Emi. First one I finished, Shizune."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Ravagestar,2,Thu Jun 11 02:48:57 2015 UTC,"I was most interested in Hanako at first but played choices a specific way for a specific reason and locked into Emi. After finishing all the good and neutral routes, I was glad she was my first."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Tynaiden,2,Thu Jun 11 03:05:05 2015 UTC,"It was my first VN so i didn't know about different routes so i just went with the wind and ended up with Emi, although i had interest to know about Hanako, which the game forgot after some time."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Yaerius,2,Thu Jun 11 04:21:02 2015 UTC,"Rin was actually my first, seems not many people get her their first time. It's funny how my feelings for her evolved, from curiosity to frustration to caring. As a romantic interest though I like Lilly the best so far, I still haven't done Hanako or Shizune, and I've never died!"
katawashoujo,39bwbu,DarthMelonLord,2,Thu Jun 11 07:32:24 2015 UTC,"Shizune, good end. It just kind of happened, as I chose options based on what I personally would actually do in those situations.  Was absolutely not disappointed."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,DatCanMan,2,Thu Jun 11 23:53:16 2015 UTC,"The girl that interested me the most was Hanako, however I ended up on the Emi path my first run."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,LRats,2,Fri Jun 12 02:53:27 2015 UTC,"Rin.  I remember finishing in about a few hours from Act 1's end to Rin's ending. I had meant to get to this game but never did until external circumstances prompted me.   I just remember walking outside and staring up into the sky for a good thirty minutes after I got Rin's good ending. I spent about one of those hours at the ""Then Explain/I need to understand/It doesn't matter"" decision. I never thought I'd get into a game like this."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,RWSchosen1,2,Fri Jun 12 03:35:57 2015 UTC,You didn't pick the Emi route the Emi route picked you. Lol. My first 2 choices were not Emi but I got her and loved every moment
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Darkon-Kriv,2,Fri Jun 12 04:23:16 2015 UTC,Rin for the win!
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Critical115,2,Fri Jun 12 06:26:27 2015 UTC,"First would be Shizune, which is ironic since she was the last route I did, and my least-favorite girl overall.  Oh wait, you're asking who my first playthrough was, not who I was first interested in.  Emi, and I totally loved it.  Kinda wish Shizune's route had been more like Emi's tbh."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Tidezen,2,Fri Jun 12 12:30:15 2015 UTC,Rin because Rin and I don't wanna explain why Rin
katawashoujo,39bwbu,ChihuahuaGod,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:30:10 2015 UTC,Went shizune rin hanako Lilly emi. I did emi last as my two friends said she was the best. But i liked shizune better as a glance so I went with her. I really liked her story but I felt it was more of you existing with shizune and sort of an awkward couple. But I liked that you finish out the year with her. It just seemed like a decent relationship with someone who was super determined in life.  The other stories are fantastic but shizune just connected with me so she's my favorite. I now end up naming mmo characters after her when I can.
katawashoujo,39bwbu,Carnith,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"My first interest was Hanako, but I got Emi because go for it was really vague.  My favorite is Rin,but had to look up a guide just to start her route because I kept getting other routes."
katawashoujo,39bwbu,SIRTreehugger,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:37:21 2015 UTC,I started Emi's route but realized that she isn't the best girl so I restarted and looked at a guide to start Hanako's route. Then I read the Suzu Pseudo route and fell in love. Then I played Emi's route.   It goes Hanako-Suzu-Emi

katawashoujo,39a5ec,legomanz80,2,Wed Jun 10 11:41:40 2015 UTC,I read as much of what he says before I cringe so hard I can't take anymore

katawashoujo,39a5ec,WhiteShamgar,6,Wed Jun 10 13:52:28 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hated him in my first play-through, but I grew to like him after finishing every route. There's something interesting about him, aside from his comedic value. For one, he's the only character you have to compare Hisao to, as the only other male student who was even given a name. The fact that he acts completely insane makes him a good foil to make Hisao both look better, and feel worse.  Plus, he has sexy eyes."

katawashoujo,39a5ec,BlazingSakura,3,Wed Jun 10 12:28:27 2015 UTC,"I dunno about that. In my opinion, there's always room for at least one character like that. After all, there are plenty of people like that in the real world as well, right? So, it's at least somewhat realistic.   I definitely agree that he's annoying, but that's also kind of the point of how he's written. You sympathize with Hisao when Kenji bugs him, feeling closer to the character you're spending the whole game with. At least, that's how I see it."

Not to mention, there are actually times when he is quite sympathetic to Hisao. He has a few decent serious scenes honestly.  You seem to either love or hate Kenji here, with no middle ground, so I guess we just happen to fall on different sides of the spectrum."
katawashoujo,39a5ec,Critical115,0,Fri Jun 12 03:38:13 2015 UTC,There is no middle ground with assholes you either love them or hate them
katawashoujo,39a5ec,FrankFalconi,2,Wed Jun 10 14:10:31 2015 UTC,"I hated him at first but he quickly grew on me. Hes a goofy and fun character. When you hear his theme come on you are like ""What do you want Kenji?"" But its that excited annoyance if that makes sense"
katawashoujo,39a5ec,Furi_Kuri,2,Wed Jun 10 14:26:27 2015 UTC,"I remember hearing that the guy who wrote Emi's path didn't like Kenji, so there's him.   Me? I liked him. I thought he was funny. I also like how the game hints that spoiler"
katawashoujo,39a5ec,faithlessdisciple,2,Wed Jun 10 14:35:20 2015 UTC,"He's a very polarizing character, people I either love him or hate him. Personally, I find him to be a dear bit of comic relief, especially in some of the heavier routes. Although, I've noticed different routes cast him in a different light.  It's really how you interpret him. Some hate him, some like him, some feel sorry for him."

katawashoujo,398qhl,Sadwegian,7,Wed Jun 10 01:51:16 2015 UTC,"Finding love and friendship has nothing to do with the amount of time. Reality is not like Katawa Shoujo; a million chances of friendship and relationships don't come every day. It's not as if you've missed your millions of chances, or you made the wrong plot choice, or anything to that extent.  Life is more like waiting for rare, invisible opportunities; we'll never know when they'll come, we'll never know how they'll appear, or if they'll appear at all. And that's beautiful in its own way. We may be unable to count our blessings, but that also means are blessings may as well be infinite.  Hang in there, friend. You haven't missed anything just because you're 28. All that can be done is to prepare for the moments ahead-- it's far more admirable to be a good person for nothing than to be a person who has good things happen when they've done nothing.  And I bet you're a fantastic person. Not afraid to tap into your own feelings. Not afraid to admit it. Able to see the value of human connection. You'll be ready for when good things happen to you. Much more so than someone like Hisao. Keep being a good person!"
katawashoujo,398qhl,bubeez,3,Wed Jun 10 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I wrote this mostly just to get it off my chest, but I realize now it reads a bit like a call for help. It's true, I'm lonely. I appreciate your help. It's comforting."
katawashoujo,398qhl,OneManArmy77,2,Wed Jun 10 23:09:18 2015 UTC,"Ill be completely honest with you for a second and say that growing old and not being able to find someone to reciprocate love is one of the scariest things to me right now. I feel for you, since I am in the same position, just 9 years younger. You will find your person though, just focus on improving yourself. Dont wait for the right girl to find you; become the right guy and find her. Godspeed."
katawashoujo,398qhl,gekiganwing,2,Wed Jun 10 02:04:30 2015 UTC,"I started dealing with my tendencies toward negativity, social anxiety, and depression several years ago. Still coping with them at age 36.  I've been active in anime-manga fandom for almost eighteen years. There have been many times when fandom has left me frustrated. Sturgeon's Law is definitely a problem, and too many ongoing series get cancelled or fade out. That said, I usually recommend browsing r/manga and r/animesuggest for at least a few minutes. If you can't find a relevant topic after several pages or searches, then ask a polite question.  Sadwegian mentioned Telltale's Walking Dead series. I currently have a copy of season one for the Vita sitting on my shelf. I know that people like it, and that it has a good reputation. However, it's been awfully easy for me to convince myself that it's a frat-centered game that's focused on excessive violence, in which the player is expected to fistpump after every headshot. I've heard it has good writing and characterization. However, it's been too easy for me to convince myself that the characters will be frequently cursing and using crass insults. In other words, I'm worried, and not sure if I will like the game."
katawashoujo,398qhl,nlourb_zdv_khuh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:28:02 2015 UTC,"You definitely have the wrong idea about that game. I couldn't imagine playing it with someone who is like how you describe. The major feeling throughout season one is you just want to keep Clementine, the little girl you are with, safe. If she is out of your sight you worry, you make choices to spare someone's life or something because you don't want to disappoint her. Violence is part of the game, mainly kept in short ""panic events"", it is a zombie game after all, but it's not a shoot em' up kind of game.  edit: I actually don't really like the TV show for some of the same reasons you are hesitant to play the game, but I really enjoyed the games."
katawashoujo,398qhl,Atario,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"I remember finding it a bit hard to get into. Played an hour or two and shelved it for six months or so. Eventually I gave it another go, but it still took me about three hours before I got really interested.   Sometimes I wonder if people who hate kids can enjoy the game. Clementine is pretty central."

I'm epileptic, and this made me think back to my first seizure. Without exception, my friends wanted to know if I was OK when I told them. Sure, the jokes came later, but it was surprising, given how the majority of our friendship was shit-talking each other, that they all changed a little, in a good way, just for that moment. I guess what I'm getting at is that there are people who do care. They might not show it, but they'll be there if something happens. Welcome to the sub!"
katawashoujo,398qhl,Joby05,2,Wed Jun 10 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"You're right. I guess what I meant was, I've never had a friend express it. It's strange. We spend so much time hiding our feelings, sometimes we forget they're there. Thank you."
katawashoujo,398qhl,Dafty-,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:16:57 2015 UTC,"Some background. I had just finished The Walking Dead Season 2, and was looking for another emotional game.   This is my exact story. I also really enjoyed Emi's story! Funny when you read about someone with a similar experience.  As far as meeting girls and making friends, that comes over time. What do you think your issues are? If you're a generally nice person, you shouldn't have a problem meeting people unless you mostly stay inside, or you're anti-social or have anxiety. Need to know more about you to know how to help."

katawashoujo,399qga,flameleaf,3,Wed Jun 10 09:09:42 2015 UTC,"Before leaving the KS universe, you should check out the pre-release version of the game. It is a leaked early copy of the script put into the KS format. The Shizune route is fairly polished and IMO a far better story than the final version. It appears that they are doing work on the Lilly/Hanako routes but I'm betting it is still pretty far from a finished work.  Also, keep in mind, there are a ton of other VNs. I'm going to say this with a LOT of love: KS is a good VN but is probably middle of the road at best when compared to the vast library of VNs available. Check out /r/vnsuggest for some advice on good visual novels like KS.   I'm fairly certain the #1 recommendation will be Grisaia no Kajitsu. I also suggest Maji de Watashi ni Koishinasai! as it is absurdly funny and good. One thing you may like is that most VNs are actually voice acted (in Japanese), so it will feel more like an anime hybrid than just a straight text story."
katawashoujo,399qga,Joby05,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:20:24 2015 UTC,"A sequel is really unlikely because Four Leaf nearly destroyed themselves making KS, and  got copyrights to prevent a sequel."

That and the good ending felt hollow to most people (although I argue that is it a great way to end and realistically how all the routes would eventually end up boiling down to).  I do recommend you go back and think of your first impressions and save the ones that gave you a good one for later. For instance,  people advised me to do Rin last, but since I really didn't care for Rin in Act 1, I ended up ending on Hanako which was a much better note for me to end my playthrough on than Rin's much more mediocre path IMO. Not saying that you won't enjoy Rin, but that is just my example. Other than that, try not to use a flow chart, but do go back for the good endings at some point if you mess up."
katawashoujo,397w6f,BlazingSakura,3,Tue Jun 9 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"That and the good ending felt hollow to most people   Right? I thought there would be more to it, but they basically just graduated and went their separate ways."
katawashoujo,397w6f,BlazingSakura,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I argue that all the other routes (very slight spoiler) spoiler It isn't the most exciting thing, but it is life.

katawashoujo,397w6f,Dannflor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:55:40 2015 UTC,"TBH, I'd say the same about Emi and even Rin's as well. It's all about how you interpret the characters and what their future will bring. Most of the routes are opend ended in that regard, I simply mentioned Lilly's because it seemed likely they'd end up going to the same college, furthering the chance of their relationship continuing."
katawashoujo,397w6f,TheDwarfLard,0,Wed Jun 10 02:04:53 2015 UTC,"There's little reason for Hanako and Hisao (Emi/Hisao or Rin/Hisao, whichever one) to not go to the same university.

katawashoujo,397w6f,Dannflor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:15:43 2015 UTC,That's true. I suppose it just stuck out in my mind because I just finished Lilly's route not two hours ago and I remembered them talking about specifically that in the epilogue.

People just prefer the other characters/routes in many cases. I have my thoughts and feelings for Hanako, but that doesn't mean I don't think the others are bad characters or their stories don't have merit. Just a matter of preference for me.  For the other routes, I'd say just don't use the flowchart for stuff beyond Act I (reaching whichever route) if you can help it. The order you read the rest of the routes doesn't particularly matter, so don't feel obliged to read them in a certain order. Though, you may want to separate the pairings of Hanako/Lilly and Emi/Rin. Reading a pairing back-to-back can cause conflict emotions and such, but you don't have to listen to me."

Lilly is your cliche love story. Hanako is more about courting her than dating her. Emi is probably the most positive (Hisao is actually quite likable in it all the others he is pretty depressing imo). Rin I did once a long time ago. I think you either love that one or hate it. Shizune was pretty boring, but Misha and Hisao are quite funny in it.   I personally prefer Lilly the most since I prefer her character the most. Hanako and Emi are second and third for me."
katawashoujo,3938gg,Merlyn_LeRoy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:12:53 2015 UTC,"I've heard that Lilly's and Rin's story are the best, but their personalities weren't really my type, but I'll give them a try."
katawashoujo,3938gg,TheDwarfLard,3,Tue Jun 9 01:19:29 2015 UTC,Extra question: How does the game work with adult contend disabled?  Since you're new here:  http://ks.renai.us/download/file.php?id=2080  http://i.imgur.com/sPwgpLj.gifv
katawashoujo,3938gg,ProtoChaud,4,Tue Jun 9 01:41:01 2015 UTC,"Act I decisions are what lead you to whichever route. In the case of Emi, promising Nurse to exercise opens up the 'Go for it.' decision later. Choosing 'Go for it.' over 'Take it easy.' is what leads you to Emi's route. There's no other decisions that affect reaching her route. Unless you have a high amount of Shizune points, said choices always lead you to Emi.  You can never get back with Iwanako. The most interaction Hisao has is with the letter in each route. His response (or lack of one) changes in each.  For removing adult content: You actually still see nude sprites (which defeats the purpose), but it completely skips over the sex scenes. It shows an image of something (generally food, I think) in place, and then skips to right after the sex. In some cases, it's not a huge deal, but in some routes, the sex scene(s) are incredibly powerful and important. Not to mention that option is the subject of a far too common joke."
katawashoujo,3938gg,TheDwarfLard,3,Tue Jun 9 02:25:06 2015 UTC,"in some routes, the sex scene(s) are incredibly powerful and important   Ain't that the truth. Rin's first one made me break down crying. That wall of text."
katawashoujo,3938gg,ProtoChaud,6,Mon Jun 8 23:16:02 2015 UTC,Hanako's is vital as well.
katawashoujo,3938gg,OneManArmy77,3,Mon Jun 8 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"True. I'm a bit biased though. Rin was my first, and I first played KS at a really dark time. That route helped me a lot."
katawashoujo,3938gg,TheDwarfLard,2,Mon Jun 8 23:27:13 2015 UTC,"I felt sick after that. I get Hanako's storyline, but it made me sick to watch that, and even worse during the confession bit later."
katawashoujo,3938gg,OneManArmy77,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"Sick how? It was meant to be uncomfortable. However, Hanako knew what going through with it meant and she still went ahead. Hisao could have refused, but he didn't (and actually waited until she noded for him to go ahead several times). At this point, and even for a decent amount of time before it, they both loved each other. I'd argue they both 'wanted it' in some way, but how they went about it wasn't the best."
katawashoujo,3938gg,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:08:09 2015 UTC,"And thats the part that makes me feel rather sick. Its a girl that is ""selling"" her body because she thinks Hisao will leave her, and a guy thats too misguided to realize what kind of pain Hanako is in. I wont argue that it was or wasnt rape, but you cant deny that Hanako felt compelled to have sex out of desparation, not because she wanted it."
katawashoujo,3938gg,OneManArmy77,0,Tue Jun 9 00:13:44 2015 UTC,"That section of the scene starts with Hanako spoiler Perhaps it might have taken longer or required more initial words instead of actions, but she spoiler  Was it out of desperation? Kind of. But it goes to show how much she cared about Hisao and how much he meant to her. And Hisao was shown to be somewhat indecisive in her route (yet he did quite clearly consider a relationship with her as early as Act III). There's a fairly large negative to the whole scene, but there's also an incredibly large positive as well.  And while it did take a lot for them to get their feelings for each other out in the open, I think their relationship is stronger because of it. For a plan that could have ended disastrously, they managed to pull through in the end. Being able to make mistakes and realizing/correcting them strengthens the two of them. It shows how far she was willing to go to learn what she wanted to learn and that Hisao wasn't going to just give up on her."
katawashoujo,3938gg,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"I understand the positive aspects, but when I look towards relationships, the emotional side of sex is supposed to be the melding of two souls and minds in a physically intimate act. I couldnt help but feel that they were more distant there than anytime else. I concede that the buildup was very positive, but any good will got crushed by the result."
katawashoujo,3938gg,OneManArmy77,0,Tue Jun 9 00:33:10 2015 UTC,"Neither of them were in the greatest state of mind at the time. It would take them some time to be able to approach sex in a more ideal way, but they both love each other enough and know that to not repeat what happened."
katawashoujo,3938gg,Joby05,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:37:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but that doesnt make what happened any better just like saying that eating a rotten egg was good because you learned not to do it again. Its great that they can learn from it and use it to help themselves, but its better than it not happen in the first place. Does my position make sense?"
katawashoujo,393ssp,WorldofSoup,2,Tue Jun 9 01:35:27 2015 UTC,I really didn't believe Hisao's dialogue in comparison to a real person. Emi's dialogue actually seems like a person would be isolated for a reason like her's. Hisao must really like Emi to have had stayed with her when he was so angry with her.

katawashoujo,393ssp,OneManArmy77,7,Tue Jun 9 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"I think BlazePath already nailed it, but I will say that its hard to empathize with every character all the time. Dissatisfaction is normal in these types of things, so I suggest you take some time and try a different route.   I cant rank them fairly considering I havent played them all, but I think you would enjoy Lilly's route since it may be a tad cliche, but its the best written imo and it will have pretty logical reasoning behind the characters actions overall, which I think is what you are looking for."
katawashoujo,393ssp,Joby05,2,Fri Jun 12 04:31:55 2015 UTC,/u/blazepath usually does. :-D
katawashoujo,393ssp,Joby05,5,Tue Jun 9 02:19:11 2015 UTC,"Not putting spoilers on any of this:  Well... no. I think Emi's was the best of the official paths and I didn't find it unsatisfying in the least.  I think Hisao really liked Emi and felt like he wanted to help her (as a friend and a boyfriend) to get over her issues. Obviously if she is crying, and pushing herself so hard, and generally acting weird he realized something is up. I think most of their journey together is him learning about her as a person. He thinks he can approach her with the whole ""don't worry, I'll save you, you poor broken person"" routine which of course makes her angry because she is stubborn and in pain. Really what she needed (and he finally figures this out) is someone to stand by her without insisting that he has all the answers. He wants to comfort her and be with her not because she NEEDS him, but because he wants to help her. It is very important that she knows he will accept her as she is and that she can reveal her past to him on a timeline that's comfortable. At the end, she finally trusts him and is able to introduce him to her father (who unfortunately died). Hisao is finally able to put everything together, they have a wonderful moment together and then their future is bright. They cut it off with them together, unsure if they will be together forever but sure that they finally understand each other and have broken down all of the communication barriers.   Also, if someone could help explain the cemetery scene that would help out a bit.    I never thought I'd be that guy but it has been a while and I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Basically... she goes there with him because she wants him to be apart of the family tradition where they honor her deceased father. She basically talks to him about the accident, what she lost and why she is how she is. She tells him that she was so upset at her loss, and so scared of losing someone else she loved that she vowed to never let anyone else in. Then she tells him she's glad they met because she learned that living alone is safer but not really a life worth living in comparison to what they've developed. Then they go back, get it on, and look towards a bright and fun future! :-D   Bonus Question: I'm considering repeating the story in order of worst to best paths, so rank the worst to best paths.   I'm going to fill in the gaps of stories I haven't played (because I couldn't muster the interest).   Rin < Shizune < Hanako < Lilly < Emi < Shizune's pre-release  Hope you enjoyed my rant... been a while since I've talked Emi ( original best girl). :-D"
katawashoujo,393ssp,Joby05,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:15:57 2015 UTC,"Very good explaination of the story. also, what do you mean by Shizune's pre-release? And does the list go from worst to best-left to right, or best to worst-right to left?"
katawashoujo,393ssp,TheDwarfLard,2,Tue Jun 9 04:14:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with Dwarf... play Shizune's official release before her pre-release. Basically, the pre-release is IMO a far better version of her story; it's darker, has a LOT more context and character development and has a lot more romance. I'm not going to spoil her story for you but most people around here rate Shizune's route as the worst (and usually she is 5/5 on best girl surveys). I personally don't think this would have been the case if her final story was a more polished version of her pre-release... but again my opinion only.  As far as my ratings, worst to best... so Rin is worst and Shizune's pre-release best."

Hanako and Shizune had fairly different routes in it. Of course, it was never meant to be seen by the public and it reflects the early stages of their development of Acts II-IV (or V in some cases).  If you're interested... However, I would not look at any route in this that you haven't seen in the official release."

katawashoujo,38z4b2,rtil,29,Mon Jun 8 01:46:12 2015 UTC,"was on /ksg/ last night thinking about who to draw. Lilly and Misha were suggested separately, but someone suggested them together on a fishing trip. I remember the old picture of the them from the year before Hisao's first Yamaku festival, and that they used to work together a lot. Maybe one day they decide to take a break and go do something fun together. I know Misha had long brown hair back then, but I wanted to draw her short pink hair...cuz i like it."
katawashoujo,38z4b2,OneManArmy77,20,Mon Jun 8 01:48:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I love your non NSFW works because you capture a lot more feeling that way. Its more endearing to see the characters this way."
katawashoujo,38z4b2,goobernuts19,14,Mon Jun 8 02:42:07 2015 UTC,"thank you. this is a personal piece, all my nsfw stuff is commission. paid work takes priority so i have less time these days to make personal work since this is my livelihood (not just making hentai but paid work in general). but i hope to be in a place some day where i can make more work like this and spend more time on it."
katawashoujo,38z4b2,goobernuts19,4,Mon Jun 8 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"How do you get paid for your pieces, if you don't mind me asking?"
katawashoujo,38z4b2,Anagram-Daine,5,Mon Jun 8 14:28:43 2015 UTC,"i'm not exactly sure what you mean. i'll try to answer your question in the two ways i'm reading it.   all the work i do is through the internet, so i mostly get paid through paypal. sometimes, if i'm doing contract work, i get sent regular checks in the mail.  if someone wants an animation or art piece from me, they'll contact me and we work out a rate that fits the job they want done. i have commission rates on my deviantart for art but for animation it's a little trickier to price which is why it's better if there's a pitch that i can make an estimate out of.  i have a portfolio site but honestly i don't think i get much work from that if any. art portals and social media is a pretty big catalyst for getting yourself out there now. i also have a patreon, so every month i technically get paid for my personal work through support of my fans. in return, i give them access to things like brushes, source files, hi-res wallpapers and stuff like that."

katawashoujo,38z4b2,Atario,6,Mon Jun 8 01:48:37 2015 UTC,"Gosh I can't tell who's the MC of this anime. Either Lilly by having big boobed-kun landing on her, or Misha from tripping onto nice girl-kun in a sexually awkward way.  Which reminds me, seriously any character in a ecchi or romance anime is clumsy as all get out."

katawashoujo,391t6j,TryHardVermin,10,Mon Jun 8 17:07:07 2015 UTC,"sigh  A week ago I would have said Hanako's. And I while I still deeply love hers, I think I have a new favourite.  Rin's is my favourite storyline, and perhaps character. I just think the route is extremely well written. I'm not sure what exactly it is that I love about it so much. I just think the character progression of both Rin and Hisao is amazing, and this route made me care for the characters and really got me invested in the story more than any other."
katawashoujo,391t6j,Dannflor,8,Mon Jun 8 17:54:08 2015 UTC,"Lilly. Im a sucker for a well written romance, and it hits home cause shes everything Id want and embodies traits id like to be someday. In a way, I hate it too, since its cracked me open emotionally and its gonna take awhile to put the pieces back together."
katawashoujo,391t6j,OneManArmy77,6,Mon Jun 8 18:21:52 2015 UTC,Rin. Because.  nailed it
katawashoujo,391t6j,ChihuahuaGod,3,Mon Jun 8 18:45:53 2015 UTC,"Scissorlips' fan route for Suzu Suzuki.  I could write an eassy on all the reasons why, and I practically have if you look at my previous posts on this sub. Simply put: out of all the girls, she is by far the most similar to me. We share the same interests, needs, and dispositions. The issues she goes through in her route were extremely similar to the same ones that have been plauging me for the majority of my life. It's because of her that I found a reason to wake up and move forward with my life."
katawashoujo,391t6j,flameleaf,3,Mon Jun 8 18:19:57 2015 UTC,Lilly's. She's probably the one I'd spend most of my time with if I was put in Hisao's shoes. She treats Hisao the best.
katawashoujo,391t6j,superhanson2,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:32:43 2015 UTC,She treats Hisao the best.   Do you really think that's true?
katawashoujo,391t6j,Joby05,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"Well she's for the most part honest, except for her leaving. She invites Hisao to places, lets him meet family. Emi also treats him well, but she's honestly a lot less open. Shizune and Misha treat him good, but she's always turning everything as a competition and she was annoying in the beginning. I don't remember Rin doing anything nice. I guess Hanako is pretty cool with Hisao, but it's mostly one sided as Hisao does more for her than she does for him."
katawashoujo,391t6j,superhanson2,3,Mon Jun 8 19:58:30 2015 UTC,"Well she's for the most part honest, except for her leaving.   Well don't you think that's a pretty major thing? Assuming he didn't push himself to a heart-attack would there even be a relationship to speak of? Not knocking Lilly, she is perfectly fine, but I don't think you could reasonably argue she is the best for Hisao.  I'd have to say Emi definitely treats him the best. She gives him the kind of tough love someone with his condition needs to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle. On top of that, I don't think she ever really lied to him, just omitted some of the facts because she was struggling. She just didn't want to let him in because she was scared, it didn't mean she was ever cruel to him or anything.  I dunno... I guess to each their own."
katawashoujo,391t6j,Joby05,2,Mon Jun 8 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"Well in Lilly's route whenever Hisao pressed on Lilly about anything on her past, she just said it. I don't remember anytime she was uncomfortable with sharing with Hisao. When Hisao pressed Emi on her past, she freaked out and got mad.   Also, he's healthier with Lilly because of her healthy adolescent sex drive"
katawashoujo,391t6j,superhanson2,2,Mon Jun 8 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"True dat. Emi definitely gives Hisao the most ""attention"". :-D"
katawashoujo,391t6j,Joby05,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"Stop having the opinions I have! I'd also add that Emi's route is the only route I felt where Hisao really helps the girl as much as she helps him. That was actually the big problem I had Lilly's route, I could not figure out why she liked him.  And what he brought to her life  that no one else could.  Edited for typos."
katawashoujo,391t6j,Jedimaester,0,Tue Jun 9 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"A case could probably be made for most (maybe all, I don't know) of the main girls."

katawashoujo,391t6j,Murloo,2,Mon Jun 8 19:46:22 2015 UTC,Don't you die at the end of this one?
katawashoujo,391t6j,Murloo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"You do die, but it's a pretty intense ending even if it's a short one"
katawashoujo,391t6j,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:29:57 2015 UTC,Yup.
katawashoujo,391t6j,PingKiccolo,3,Mon Jun 8 22:46:55 2015 UTC,"Lilly.   Lilly's story is a lot slower than the others yes, but to me the feelings that are in it are so much more powerful than most others. The only one that really made me stop and go ""wow"" during one of the scenes was Hanako's. Who is a very close second. The only reason she isn't first is because I like Lilly's personality more."
katawashoujo,391t6j,BlazingSakura,3,Mon Jun 8 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"Emi, Hanako, Lilly, and Shizune are all my favorite, but force me to choose and I say Emi. The effects her issues had on her is very akin to ones I've faced. She is not the most like me (That'd be Hanako), but she is the one I would most like to have as a companion or friend. Not to mention, I really love Hisao in this route. His transition between jerk to kind was much more clear to me and it was inspiring to see both Emi and Hisao finding ways to help each other, rather than it being one way or the other.  But again, the margin between it and Lilly, Hanako, and Shizune is almost nothing."
katawashoujo,391t6j,TheDwarfLard,5,Mon Jun 8 21:38:34 2015 UTC,"Hanako's.  Simply put, I'm incredibly similar to her, so seeing her become friends and soon after fall in love with Hisao was powerful, to say the least. In turn, it was the same experience to see Hisao do the same. Hanako, Hisao, and her route gave me a sense of hope that I didn't have before. I certainly haven't done everything I want to or as much as I could, but there's absolutely no way I'd be where I am without that experience.  It may or may not have prompted me to write like 17 pages of summary/analysis."
katawashoujo,391t6j,Xilirite,2,Mon Jun 8 23:32:36 2015 UTC,"Rin's route. I don't feel like typing all my thoughts out a second time, so let's just say that it quite literally changed my life."
katawashoujo,391t6j,OneManArmy77,3,Mon Jun 8 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"Lilly. Im a sucker for a well written romance, and it hits home cause shes everything Id want and embodies traits id like to be someday. In a way, I hate it too, since its cracked me open emotionally and its gonna take awhile to put the pieces back together."
katawashoujo,391t6j,EinsteinReplica,2,Mon Jun 8 20:54:32 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I played Katawa, and I've fallen for other shows like Angel Beats and other Japanese culture, but even then, Hanako is still my favourite character and storyline from pretty much anything. Her story line may have been short, but it was incredibly powerful and her character was incredible as well. Truly the best route.  After that I'd put Emi, Lilly, Shizune/Misha and then finally Rin."
katawashoujo,391t6j,PingKiccolo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"If you liked Angel Beats and you like romance stuff I HIGHLY suggest watching Clannad. The Visual Novel is done by Key Studios (same as the Angel Beats light novel, and soon to be Angel Beats Visual novel :D)  and the romantic story of it is amazing. It starts slowly though. And Clannad After Story is even more amazing than clannad IMO"
katawashoujo,391t6j,EinsteinReplica,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:22:46 2015 UTC,I'll add it to my to-watch list <3
katawashoujo,391t6j,PingKiccolo,2,Mon Jun 8 21:41:37 2015 UTC,God I wish my to watch list was that small....i could actually watch all that I want to lol. Also Toradora is another really good anime
katawashoujo,391t6j,flameleaf,2,Mon Jun 8 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"Mind if I second that reccomendation for Death Note? I re-watched it recently and it still holds up. I'd still call it one of my favorites.  There's also Monster, if you end up liking DN. It takes a more realistic approah, but it ends up being a lot darker, and has probably the greatest villian of all time. Can't think of a better murder/mystery anime."
katawashoujo,391t6j,flameleaf,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:49:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the first half of it is brilliant, anyway. After Near and Mello get introduced it does take a pretty big hit in quality. Mello hardly does anything and Near is just too arrogant. Really not a fan of his character.  I think most people like it because of the intense chess game that goes on between Light and L. It's easy to get sucked into it, and most animes have much simpler plots than that.  Also it birthed the next best thing to My Immortal in the so-bad-it's-hillarious fanfic department, so there's that."
katawashoujo,391t6j,flameleaf,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:20:40 2015 UTC,It's entire soundtrack was pretty awesome. Especially that 2nd opening. It's not every day you find a band as insane as Maximum the Hormone.

However Lilly's route is cliche, poorly paced (at the end), and fairly predictable.. but interacting with Lilly in Act 1 and her Act 2 is my favorite parts of the game. I also like how it is more about fixing Hisao than Lilly. I just wish Hisao wasn't so damn depressing in it. He gave up way too easy in that route/didn't take care of himself at all."

katawashoujo,38wn1v,TheDwarfLard,6,Sun Jun 7 17:22:57 2015 UTC,So we FINALLY see some art after the Japanese release...what took them so long? D:
katawashoujo,38wn1v,Sohtak,5,Sun Jun 7 17:43:47 2015 UTC,I doubt there were many Japanese readers (that are now just reading it). Take that likely low number and factor in the generally low-ish number artists among a fan-base.

If you require someone else to feel complete, you were never complete as a person in the first place. How can you expect others to love you enough to spend time with you, when you can't even do that to yourself? My motto is, if you're in a relationship, great. Enjoy having someone be there for you. If your single, great, enjoy being free and not having to worry about anyone else.   The solution to your problem? The reason you feel this way is because you're not satisfied with yourself or the people already in your life. Focus on yourself. Pick up hobbies, not to distract you, but to invest in yourself. If you invest in yourself, maybe someone else is gonna invest in you and your story."

At the same time, when you are happy you want to share that happiness, you want to make someone else happy and I think that is what OP was getting at."
katawashoujo,38zasz,TheBirdMan2012,2,Tue Jun 9 16:12:13 2015 UTC,"We all feel that way sometimes. There are a few girls who I'd want to be romantically involved with, but I don't really think they want anything more than best friends at most, which is just fine with me, as they make unbelievably fantastic friends. Still, I always do think how much of a wonderful adventure and experience it would be just have a happy relationship. Hopefully we both can figure it out. By the way, being a good cook is a huge advantage you got there!  Also, I can't say I agree with you saying Lilly is best girl because Emi, Hanako, Shizune, AND Lilly are all best girl."

katawashoujo,38z331,Parzivus,2,Wed Jun 10 02:14:19 2015 UTC,"I've been reminded of a few of the characters in other places, and it's quite numerous to say the least.  Rin  I have a Spanish friend that I've been talking to on the Skypes with for about a year now. She's incredibly funny and a good person to talk to, and she has spoiler Although my friend is instead more sort of split-personality, she is definitely like Rin in the sense that she can seem very hard to understand unless you get very close to her. Cut off her arms and you'd have a Spanish Rin. El Rin, if you will.  Hanako  Another friend, this time a real life one from my class at school. She is kind of like an amalgamation of some basic traits of the KS girls (blonde hair like Lilly's, and is bisexual (maybe pansexual) like Misha), but overall I've pinned her to be very close to the likes of Hanako. She's rather timid to people she doesn't know, has a quite hard life due to other conditions I won't detail, and is also sometimes suicidal, like spoiler. She's a very good friend though, if hard to get to know, and she can have some Rin traits in being hard to understand, but overall she's definitely a Hanako-like person.  Emi  Another irl friend from my class, this time somebody I'm even closer to. This friend is athletic, kind of short, and is fun to talk to and has a dirty humour, all traits shared by Ms. Ibarazaki in KS, and probably one of my best friends overall. She also, like Emi spoiler, just in a different format to that of Emi's in the game. She's a very good friend, definitely.  Hisao  We're getting to people who appear in other animes and mangas now, with the main character Yizeru Otonashi from the show ""Angel Beats"", an anime about teenagers who get stuck in this afterlife after they died unfairly. This may be a general theme in Japanese culture, since Japanese culture focuses a lot on blood types as well, but the character Yizeru in the show MASSIVE SPOILER FOR SHOW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT spoiler. The friendliness of both Hisao and Yizeru is very apparent, and the heart-storyline that plays in both shows is very close too.  That's all for now. If I remember or think of any others, I shall post them here <3"

There's currently another read-through happening Let's Dub, but updates are fairly infrequent. Outside of that, there's LPs around, some of which may adhere to the script quite closely, but some have tangents.  If someone knows of a LP where it's very close to the script, that'd likely work. Otherwise, it'd take A LOT of time to do, especially if you want everyone in the same room at once. My recommendation is to look around before starting that."

katawashoujo,38vdig,Gaffgaff123,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:04:35 2015 UTC,but updates are fairly infrequent.   But only because they do a bunch of other projects too.

katawashoujo,38vdig,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:09:55 2015 UTC,"I have a potential idea. Instead of getting voice actors to say the whole thing, you could modify the engine to have a Text To Speech engine.  Of course, the quality is very far from what a human reading would sound like, with no emotion, and depending on implementation, all characters would have the same voice. But it's probably easier than voice acting the whole thing.

katawashoujo,38to34,OneManArmy77,2,Sat Jun 6 19:00:11 2015 UTC,Oh my goodness! Actual constructive criticism!  So the issue is that the image doesn't look soft enough? That's understandable. I have an idea. Let me see what I can do.

I would trim down the ears slightly, change the chin and try to slim down the face a bit more. I think the eyebrows being so thick might be contributing to the lack of feminine lines as well"

And unless 1.3.1 introduces some major bug, I don't think there is too much of a reason for needing technical support from them. If it's something minor, other can likely handle it."

The devs can wash their hands of it (And some of them have) and that just leaves us, the community which I sadly feel is only growing smaller.  Until there's just a few of us really super dedicated left like me...I'll be all alone! I'll be that odd guy 30 years from now that still loves some obscure VN from 2012 that no ones heard of.

Best hope for the future  I also hunderstand everything , i'm not going to explain too much But I'm a artist and I used to love art , fact is I have very serious psychologic problem which break every part of my motivation, skill etc... So I don't draw even if all my teacher say ""you have talent you know how art work""   When I play Rin part I start to analyse how Rin personnality was ( like every other girl of course but since Rin is artist you obvously understand that it was my fav ) !  And you know what ? Maybe I'm wrong Maybe you felt something else , Maybe I created that but....  For me Rin is a true artist in the heart.... She don't want to do art for this for that , to looks like this or anyshit....   She do art for art because she can do it so she do it. That's all. She know how to paint so she paint. That's why She felt really bad during the art Gallery project , because she don't want to have rules , she don't want to have to explain why blueu and not red... She paint what she feel , what she have in mind in the moment... Art is like this , you do things 'cause you can , you express what you can't put words on it  , and Rin is bad at speak so she paint what she can't speak She can't say I love you to you (Hisao) but I'm sure she can do a draw for express her love  And That's why  she felt soooo good and happy in the good ending when she is finnally alone , normally you would cry and say """" F--- my teacher stop helping me... """" but she... she don't give a F--- cause she just want freedom and paint for the fun of painting the feel of painting the f--ing thing you have in your heart when you express yourself on a paper , a canvas or a wall...  This girl is a true artist.  Then If you keep reading despite my bad english and you are agree with me , well you know what ? This thing I understood it before Act 2 start....  I all along the story I just saw that I was right again and again and again... I totally understood Rin in 5min and.... yeah call me crazy or teenager , but I felt in love  But she is a piece of 0 and 1 you know , so I will never ever meet the girl of my dream....   So yes me too , Rin affected my life. I can also talk about other aspect of KS that affected my life but I wont the post will be too long...  I hope you understood everything despite of my crual english once again , and sorry to bore you if I dit... When I read your post I just needed to say it at least once somewhere 'cause no one in my real life could understand it"

katawashoujo,38ovo5,MaybeNickCage,16,Fri Jun 5 17:00:10 2015 UTC,So I came out publically today as bisexual to my friends and everybody accepted me. Still need to tell my bi-disliking mum tho.
katawashoujo,38ovo5,EinsteinReplica,3,Fri Jun 5 19:05:59 2015 UTC,Good luck! Remember to be brave and never be afraid to let the world know who you are.

I can't imagine what a weight it must be to have to keep something like that a secret for so long or what a relief it must be to have it off your shoulders! Good luck telling your mom. You'll be in my thoughts and prayers. Make no apologies for who you are!

Things may get tougher or might get easier but the more 'you' you can be, the better it will be in the end. There is still Katawa Shoujo too!  Out of three other friends, all their confessions also turned out for the best. One had a rough year with their father and another's friend ditched them but they managed to keep themselves together and live much happier lives now."
katawashoujo,38ovo5,Tynaiden,6,Sat Jun 6 02:51:29 2015 UTC,How are you guys doing this week?
katawashoujo,38ovo5,TheFlagonWagon,3,Fri Jun 5 18:33:29 2015 UTC,"Really good. School is out and I don't start summer school till latter this month so I have a lot of time to just play video games. I have been playing a ton of New Vegas because of the fallout 4 hype, but I also I have been playing a lot of the other games I play all of the time like Crypt of the Necrodancer, Minecraft, and Binding of Isaac. How about you?"
katawashoujo,38ovo5,TheFlagonWagon,2,Fri Jun 5 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"Dude, I am so hype for Fallout 4 that I can't even think straight. I've got >100 hours in New Vegas and ~80 in FO3, and so I'm probably more excited than is healthy.  Lately, I've been playing the Witcher 3, and I've been having a really good time getting into the lore. It's one of those worlds you can really lose yourself in, you know? And it's got that mindlessly addictive quality where you're playing at 3am, and you just can't convince yourself to stop because if you level up one more time you'll be able to upgrade your armor, and you just have to see what it looks like."
katawashoujo,38ovo5,Joby05,2,Fri Jun 5 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Fallout 4 will be SO much good times. :-D"

katawashoujo,38ovo5,OneManArmy77,2,Fri Jun 5 18:56:20 2015 UTC,Thanks! Im just hoping I dont get lazy. I need to start getting disciplined and theres no time like the present
katawashoujo,38ovo5,MasterlessAshenMyles,2,Fri Jun 5 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"Matura exams are being annoying. Summer isn't looking to be any better, given the driving test and the university exam. All in all a stressful period. Witcher 3 keeps me company tho, so that's nice I suppose. How about you?"
katawashoujo,38ovo5,TheFlagonWagon,2,Fri Jun 5 20:07:43 2015 UTC,"I'm doing alright! Also playing Witcher 3. One of the better high-budget games to come out recently, imho. I probably won't get into anything else until they release the 18+ version of Grisaia. I've been doing some work proofreading for a consulting firm. It's boring, but it pays well and setting my own hours is nice. Summer is looking pretty alright for me so far. Except lots of drama going on in my social circle. That's pretty rough.  Sorry about all the work you've got going on, but the good thing about exams is that once they're out of the way you won't ever have to worry about them again. Hope you do well!"
katawashoujo,38ovo5,MasterlessAshenMyles,2,Fri Jun 5 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"I hope that too, yeah. Witcher 3 is, in my opinion, the best RPG of the last decade, but we can both agree that it's a REALLY good game. I mean, the amount of detail that CDPR put into this game is unreal, plus the game itself feels polished and fun to play, the story is amazing and the sidequests don't feel boring at all. Too bad that with F4 we probably won't see Witcher 3 being crowned as GOTY which, imo, deserves it. Oh well, I guess that's the privilege of Fallout 4 being a Fallout I suppose."
katawashoujo,38ovo5,FollowThePact,2,Fri Jun 5 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"I've got my last exam on Monday of my Junior year, shit, not sure if I'm ready for my last year of highschool.

katawashoujo,38ovo5,Joby05,4,Sat Jun 6 01:33:06 2015 UTC,"Fallout 4! As I said 2(?) weeks ago, I have been playing a ton of New Vegas so this is a great time to announce fallout 4, at least for me. Almost always in video games I go with a good character, don't steal, don't kill ect. But today I started a character in which I will do every last bad thing. So far it is kinda fun getting stealth kills because my weapons/gear is good enough to take every one out right. And because of this I was wandering what you guys normally do in these kinds of games?  Also, I just found this on /r/fallout, http://i.imgur.com/tQEIAgs.jpg"

katawashoujo,38ovo5,Murloo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:22:30 2015 UTC,"There are some characters that are from the older games, but the story all in all makes sense even without playing the first 2 games. Yes, there are some stuff that they talk about that is from the first 2 games, but the game itself stands tall without the need of buying the previous 2 games. I recommend it in general, since its a VERY, VERY good game that received global praise."
katawashoujo,38ovo5,Murloo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"That sounds cool, like I said if I have got the money I will buy it. Also, are the first 2 games really dated? I might want to play them as well but if they are too old I will pass."

Nevertheless the story is good, it has its strong points tho to be completely honest, I would not go back to them after playing the third one. Still, there is an option to import your savefile from Witcher 2 in Witcher 3 that gives you some cameos of older chars that could die in the second game (a nice touch, but nothing too major)."

The rest of the sweets are yellow. Hannah takes a random sweet from the bag. She eats the sweet. Hannah then takes at random another sweet from the bag. She eats the sweet. The probability that Hannah eats two orange sweets is 1/3. Show that n²-n-90=0.""  This used to be set for 13 year olds in the early 80s."

It is hilarious at times, and tear jerking at others. It really deeply explores the concept of family and what it means to be a family. If you're looking for something that is mostly lighthearted but also has some serious moments I definitely recommend it.  It did do one thing I didn't think would ever happen... it made me quit before finishing it entirely. I played through Aoba's route second and I just couldn't go on any further. Her ending was extremely good and felt like the perfect end to the story. I just couldn't imagine going back. It definitely felt like this was the right ending choice for me and nothing else really made any sense.

katawashoujo,38ovo5,thatJainaGirl,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"HotS is godlike. Like Rock Paper Shotgun said about the game today: ""...they looked at the intricate things [MOBAs] have become, barnacled with opaque traditions and dense formulae – they looked at all this and said, 'What if someone, like, actually fucking designed this?'"" It's unbelievably fun.  If you want to play, shoot me a PM and add me to your friends list and we can play together :D  As for Hearthstone, I'm 100% fine with $10 hero skins. You buy important in game stuff with in game gold, you support Blizzard with real money purchases of cosmetics."

katawashoujo,38ovo5,MangoMonarch,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:06:03 2015 UTC,"I have been avoiding MOBA styled games specifically because the arena-lane ones are exactly that (to me), bloated and mired in formulas that have to be followed or you get scrub-shamed. Just want something that has characters that are characters against other characters.  I want to play a caster, then I should watch out for ganks and support the front lines. I want to play a tricksy CC character, then I know my skills and how to maximize them while outwitting my opponents to deny them attacking my weaknesses. Not this meta-meta-store-loadout-flavorofthemonthexploit-toptieronly stuff.  I haven't been playing Hearthstone because it's starting to get the same way it seems. But if you and RPS say HotS isn't like that then I shall have to give it a fair whirl then."
katawashoujo,38ovo5,Tynaiden,0,Fri Jun 5 23:07:56 2015 UTC,"In any competitive environment, there will always be a ""meta"" as people try out different things and find what works. It's not just video games; football playbooks and batting orders in baseball are meta. This is because of a design concept called imperfect balance, wherein a slight advantage given to some styles will encourage plays by styles that negate that advantage. However, Heroes is a much different beast than the usual MOBA, since it's shorter, objective-based, and more team focused than other MOBAs (the entire team levels up as one with a shared exp pool, and talents are gained on certain levels rather than items bought from a shop). I would absolutely recommend it, especially if you've wanted to like MOBAs but League and Dota weren't for you."

Been trying to keep from getting hyped on Overwatch as I have stopped playing TF2. I still haven't bought Warlords of Draenor either but my friends' guild has been needing to PUG for a tank or healer and dropping hints at getting me geared up to help if I finally get back in the game.  Never really had too much issue with Hearthstone, I was just getting bored trying to have fun and earn card backs when ranked can get ruthless at times and my luck with arena is horrendous. But if they're finally going to spice up the game with some more class options then guess I'll be messing with that again for a bit too. Dang it."

O-types are thought of as responsible, practical and rule-conscious and organized. They make excellent leaders and their determination helps them achieve their goals. They are pretty much determined to be best girls, as is the case, and either way this maps exactly upon zoon-zoon.  AB on the other hand are unpredictable."

Just to clarify, I suppose: Hanako's route was too short in terms of length, but it ends where it needs to. Most of the difficulty comes from reaching the point where a relationship is possible, not maintaining it (there's still some difficulty there, but not nearly as much). And with some events surrounding Hanako in Lilly's route, there's no reason why they wouldn't happen post good ending Hanako's route, perhaps even sooner.  As for dealing with all of it, I read a ton of fan-fiction and contemplated my life, in a way. Made attempts to correct/change things I felt needed to be change and make improvements. Still in the process of that, in all honesty."
katawashoujo,38gyrv,TheDwarfLard,4,Thu Jun 4 03:39:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the more I think on it, the more I realize the route had done all it could. I guess I just didn't want it too end so quickly because I was enjoying it."
katawashoujo,38gyrv,TheDwarfLard,2,Thu Jun 4 04:53:37 2015 UTC,"I think another part is that Suriko had to manage both Hanako and Lilly's routes in the end (originally just Lilly's) because Cpl_Crud had to leave or something. He certainly had a good base go on, but did have to do a decent amount of work. In the end, I'm more than satisfied with what we got."
katawashoujo,38gyrv,Dannflor,5,Thu Jun 4 04:58:27 2015 UTC,"Glad you enjoyed it! I myself haven't finished all the routes yet. I'm currently working on Lilly.  Personally, I loved Hanako, she was my first, but I just recently did Rin. And holy crap, I might have liked her more than Hanako's. I can't really say why. While I love them all, I generally rate them on how much they affected me, or made me feel. Hanako's and Rin's made me feel the most.  Emi's was nice, I liked it, but it didn't affect me on the same level, I can see why others would like it, but I just didn't relate as much.  Shizune's was... interesting. I think I can answer your question on why not many people seem to like her path. I think you answered it yourself really.  Her path is more about friendship than romance. In fact, it almost seems like Shizune's and Hisao's relationship is always in the background, or at least rarely mentioned. I really like this route because it is different, and the friendship that is built up is really touching. However, I think because of this ""lighter"" approach, it doesn't get as intense as some of the other routes, and I think that might be why people shy away from it. It doesn't give the same ""feels"" as some of the others might.  One last thing about Shizune's route is the ending, which is rather open ended. While I like it, I know many don't. I think it's probably the most realistic of all the endings, but some just want a happily ever after.  Anyway, sorry I went on a bit of a rant there. But I'm glad you enjoyed most of the routes! I'm kinda in the same situation as you. Found Katawa Shoujo several weeks ago, been obssessed with it ever since.   I better go finish Lilly's route now..."
katawashoujo,38gyrv,Jason-OCE,2,Thu Jun 4 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"...You're totally right, I did kind of answer my own question. Yeah, I guess I can see why people would be disappointed in that. I pretty much agree with you, as one of the things that impresses me about Shizune's path is that the romance doesn't need to play a huge part to tell a great story.  As for the ending, all the other routes end before graduation, so I'd say I admire it for addressing the reality.   Hope you enjoy the rest of Lilly's route!"

There aren't a whole lot of people who are a little like both of them (though if you hang around long enough, you'll find some here and there)."

katawashoujo,38gyrv,thatJainaGirl,4,Thu Jun 4 19:13:24 2015 UTC,"WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE THIS PATH? I DON'T UNDERSTAND! (Ahem).    I got this! I don't know if many people HATE her path... but let's objectively compare it to the others.   Lilly: sweet cliche romance.   Emi: lots of trials and tribulations with extra gratifying romance as you break through her emotional wall.   Hanako: lots of trials and tribulations with mega ultra gratifying romance as you've broken through her almost impenetrable wall and finally get close to her.  Shizune: slice of life character study with little to no romance.  Which one doesn't really belong with the rest? To be honest... it feels like Shizune got the short end of the stick. Is a character study bad... no. Is it disappointing when everyone else has a nice romantic story with their #1 girl and all Shizune fans are left with little to no closure but instead this nonsense.   Of course, then there is the pre-release (if it were a drinking game of drink whenever I mention it most of the sub would be dead by now). It tells a semi-dark, extremely emotional and complete story that satisfies me as a Shizune fan. Yes, it's not cannon. No, A22 might not have liked it and thought it was sub-par to what he released in the final game. Regardless of all of that, it is an excellent story and my personal favorite. :-D"
katawashoujo,38gyrv,Tynaiden,3,Thu Jun 4 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"I think in Emi and Shizune's route Hisao is the most likable. That's their major draw for me. I really didn't like Hisao at all in Lilly or Hanako's route. I did Rin's route once a long time ago. It wasn't for me. Lilly and Hanako are still my favorite girls tho + they have the best music imo.  Lilly's route unravels a bit too fast. That's my major knock on it. I don't mind cliches, but the pacing in her final act was a bit too frantic for me. It also breaks my heart seeing Hanako in Lilly's route. I dunno I may be overthinking it, but it really felt like she was crushing hard on Hisao in it (even more so than Lilly until the holiday). I also hated how Hisao and Lilly talked about Hanako as a ward/daughter. Hisao is way too depressing for me in this route as well. He is kind of depressing in every route at times, but in Lilly's he is almost always depressing/bitter until the ending.  I actually don't mind the length of Hanako's route. I think her route is more about courting than dating, and once you get past the former the second should be pretty do-able/easy. Hanako's route primarily deals with tearing down emotional walls on both sides required to be a couple/equals. I don't think anything too interesting would of happened after they were dating. At least not interesting enough to include in the VN. Maybe helping Hanako address her issues to Lilly about their friendship? IDK I think that would be better if Hanako did that on her own between them.  I haven't played Shizune/Emi in a long time. I remember the Misha bomb caught me off guard too. I felt Misha and Hisao were the highlights of the route. Emi's route felt the most natural/easy going. I believe that is why she is the easiest to get locked into. She is the player's and Hisao's training wheels for the VN. I believe Emi is the best route overall, but Lilly is my girl. I'm a sucker for blonde/blue eyed classy girls.  What I did/how I dealt with post KS:  I read a bit of fanfiction after I finished KS. I don't usually read fanfiction, but there is some really good stuff on the KS website. I just went to the archive thread and crtl+f the character I wanted to read about. There are comedys, dramas, etc. I believe there are alternative paths as well (one done by a dev too) under the fanfiction tab. Developments by dewelar is really good. It involves Emi/Lilly/Hanako mostly. The drama kind of drags on like a soap opera sometimes (but you may enjoy that) is my only real knock against it. The author writes the characters very well especially Hanako.  I haven't played any other visual novels, so I can't suggest another one similar/same quality."
katawashoujo,38gyrv,thatJainaGirl,3,Thu Jun 4 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"Let me jump in and talk about (best girl best route) Rin for a second:  Rin isn't about symbolism, it isn't about deeper meaning. It's about understanding, and accepting that love doesn't require perfect understanding. Rin intentionally avoids symbolism, because she's afraid that the symbols may be misinterpreted. She uses her paintings as a medium to communicate her feelings because she has no other way to do that. She's on the other side of a canyon and she can't cross it. She's so intent on her paintings having clear meaning that she won't even title them because the title may alter the intended interpretation. For Rin, it's not about symbolism or communication, it's about understanding, and about accepting that, sometimes, you don't need to understand."
katawashoujo,38gyrv,scorptatious,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:59:33 2015 UTC,"Word that relay what I meant but couldn't figure out! Pretty much. I had a eight page e-doc of various interactions between the two and my various thoughts on those and the similarities in my own life. Even when people ask me or mention what that word is or might be from the end of Rin's route, a snap reaction as quick as any other reflex screams ""Rin"".  But round-a-bout: as much as we enjoy something, sometimes we just need to accept what it is and appreciate it being there for us to have in our life."
katawashoujo,38gyrv,Tynaiden,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"I suppose I am being a bit harsh on Rin because I actually found her route very moderately enjoyable. It is just that I find the other routes so so so much more enjoyable. Though as I said before, I completely get why people love this route, I just found it had a lot of rambling and pretentious talk between the really good parts. And some people really love that stuff, but it just isn't as of an applicable concept to my life as it is to others."
katawashoujo,38gyrv,Acknown3,2,Thu Jun 4 13:41:56 2015 UTC,"The beauty of KS is how everyone finds something of themselves in one of the girls. In Rin I saw a mirror of myself almost flawlessly, except with writing instead of painting (and with arms). In fact, I found KS through my girlfriend at the time telling me how much I reminded her of Rin. That's why I love Rin so much.  (But I'm a blend of all six main girl characters, seriously check out last week's casual talk thread it's scary. I even kind of have Hanako's scars but it's just sunburn)."
katawashoujo,38gyrv,FollowThePact,2,Thu Jun 4 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"Rin is an acquired taste I feel. I can see why people like her so much, and for the most part, I did enjoy her route, but something about it just didn't click with me like some of the others did.  Wholeheartedly agree with both Emi and Hanako. With Emi, from what I remember from the route, I liked how she was able to get Hisao out of his funk and help make him a healthier and happier person.  Hanako's path was just filled with feels. Especially towards the end. I guess it was a little short compared to some of the other routes, but I didn't really mind. I still consider it my favorite route overall."

katawashoujo,38h0j4,waffelz436,9,Thu Jun 4 03:47:15 2015 UTC,"That is the situation as to why she did that, but I wouldn't say she regretted it. She felt he was drifting away and Hisao was the first boy she definitely loved, so she was willing to take drastic measures to at least attempt to make things work out. With Hisao's confession, he's finally able to get his feelings for Hanako out in the open (that's he had since the beginning of Act III) and that confirms Hanako's hopes that he loves her in return. The confession and mutual declaration of love (Hanako more than hints at it multiple times, but doesn't actually say it) helps both of them forward, but they both need to actively move towards the future. And Hisao's confession is what brings them together right then and there, because it's openly and actively saying they both want this to happen (Hanako's actions heavily indicate this and her primary desire is the same thing). Hanako has fears of whether or not she can move forward, becoming more sociable with others. However, seeing what she's done in the past six weeks or so, Hisao knows that she and can encourages her to move forward.  Overall, most of the difficulty comes from reaching the point where a relationship is possible. There's still some afterwards, just not as much.  Edit: Forgot some stuff."
katawashoujo,38h0j4,TheDwarfLard,2,Thu Jun 4 04:01:59 2015 UTC,"I like your take on it, thanks. If only we could get a little epilogue, showing a little on how they adjusted in the future. Though I suppose leaving it up to the imagination works too."
katawashoujo,38h0j4,TheDwarfLard,7,Thu Jun 4 04:14:24 2015 UTC,"It's not canon in any way, but Sisterhood is quite good for that. Has Lilly route spoilers as well. Extends for another year and 8 months or so. I don't necessarily agree with everything in it, but I get the reasons why. Also, it's incredibly long (longer than the entirety of KS, I think)."
katawashoujo,38h0j4,Dannflor,2,Thu Jun 4 04:19:19 2015 UTC,"I'll attempt to play Lily's route then give it a read. Even if it's not canon, it should be interesting. Thanks for the recommendation!"
katawashoujo,38h0j4,TheDwarfLard,6,Thu Jun 4 10:23:31 2015 UTC,"I think most of the ""drama"" mostly resolves itself in that final scene you talk about. Most of what was wrong between the two of them was simply misunderstanding. Hisao misunderstanding Hanako's wants and needs, and perhaps Hanako misunderstanding how much Hisao cares for her.  In the final breakdown these walls that they'd put up between themselves come down, and in doing so, I believe any past misgivings or misunderstandings are also brought down, thus forgiven.  Just my interpretation. There's a lot left to the imagination in how Hanako grows after her good ending."
katawashoujo,38h0j4,Crowst,7,Thu Jun 4 04:46:24 2015 UTC,"I think an interesting part of is that they both at least begin to love each other as early as Act III, but keep missing each other until the ending."
katawashoujo,38h0j4,Crowst,5,Thu Jun 4 05:04:36 2015 UTC,"The long and short is that Hanako and Hisao both loved each other, but couldn't express it because they both had their own hangups. Hanako makes the extreme decision to sleep with Hisao because she was concerned about losing him. After her breakdown near her birthday, she realizes she has become a thing to protect in Hisao's mind instead of a romantic interest.  I see it as very in character for her because she's very scared of losing people because of her past. She basically only has two people close to her, Lilly and Hisao, so losing either of them would be utterly devastating.  I think she regretted what she did only insofar as it didn't work exactly the way she planned. She loved Hisao, so if anything she was happy to sleep with him, but things were still awkward because neither she nor Hisao could say what needed to be said to move out of the no man's land they occupied.   She thought it would be a obvious solution to her problem. If Hisao is willing to sleep with me, he must care for me was her logic. Of course, she realizes in the morning that it's possible that Hisao just slept with her because she was willing, which made her nervous and unable to act again (especially because now the situation was dire since she might potentially lose Hisao permanently).  Of course any hang ups she might have had from that night basically evaporated once Hisao confessed. It both justified her actions and removed any fear of losing him. Based on the remainder of the route it appears that she really doesn't give it a second thought after that and is just happy to be with Hisao."
katawashoujo,38h0j4,LRats,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:37:13 2015 UTC,"Your explanation makes a good amount of sense to me, thanks. I'm also trying to wrap my head around who made the first overtly sexual advances. I think that means a lot in deciphering how dramatically the sex affected them. On one hand, Hanako taking off her clothes is the obvious spark for them sleeping together. But on the other hand, Hanako had had the viewpoint before where, if Hisao shared with her, she would eventually share back. So, she may have just been sincerely showing her scars to Hisao in response to him. Then, when Hisao took off his clothes in response she decided that sex was what he wanted in order for him to view her as an equal rather than something to protect. I honestly can't determine which one is closer to the truth. Any ideas?"
katawashoujo,38h0j4,thatJainaGirl,3,Fri Jun 5 03:39:51 2015 UTC,"I've played the route three times through now and I honestly have a slightly different feel every time I play it. I think my feelings on the first playthrough are probably the most accurate though because I didn't know what to expect and I didn't have other routes or previous knowledge coloring my judgment.   At that time I felt that Hanako knew what was going to happen. The biggest indicator to me was her leading Hisao to the room and having him lock the door. Based on the way it is written it seemed like she knew what was going to happen. That was my initial impression.  I think that view is further confirmed by three things:   Hanako is shy not stupid. She should be well aware of what it means to get naked in front of the opposite sex. She doesn't hesitate at all despite showing nothing but hesitation up to this point. Her resolve demonstrates that she had thought this through well in advance and had made up her mind to follow through. Hanako doesn't resist when Hisao makes his move. And if I am remembering correctly, she even comes and sits down in his lap on the bed. This willingness also demonstrates to me her original intent as well. In the same vein as #2, Hanako's ability to overcome her extreme social anxiety--especially in one of the most embarrassing possible situations, particularly for an adolescent--implies her intent."
katawashoujo,38h0j4,Sohtak,2,Fri Jun 5 08:51:50 2015 UTC,"There is definitely still things the two of them will have to muddle through, however, the main conflict of the story was over. There really wasn't anything else to tell in the story of Hisao and Hanako."
katawashoujo,38h0j4,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:34:00 2015 UTC,"Be careful talking about Hanako's sex scene in this sub. People are very eager to downvote you to preserve their interpretation of her, even if the text itself shows that they're wrong."
katawashoujo,38h0j4,thatJainaGirl,3,Thu Jun 4 16:52:13 2015 UTC,"Peope get upset about it because its such a common misconception that peope spout as fact.   They think Hanako is unable to do anything herself. She clearly made the choice to do what she did, perhaps under false pretenses sure. But she made that choice herself"
katawashoujo,38h0j4,TheDwarfLard,2,Thu Jun 4 17:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yet, the text itself shows that Hisao knew Hanako consented during the scene. But that's not to say he isn't quite confused and somewhat lost afterwards."
katawashoujo,38h0j4,TheDwarfLard,2,Thu Jun 4 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"His issue is that Hanako's mental state makes consent, even a ""nod to keep going,"" a super unclear thing. It definitely seems like she's consenting during the sex scene, but Hisao (and the reader) remember after that Hanako really isn't in a position, physically or emotionally, to say no. So while it turned out to be ok, there's still that string of text boxes where the nature of consent with Hanako is unclear."
katawashoujo,38d6sf,Atario,16,Wed Jun 3 13:30:47 2015 UTC,"Under certain conditions, I think this could happen sooner than we may believe. Anyway, happy-with-herself Hanako is always a nice sight.  Edit: With the way she's dressed up, maybe she's getting ready for a date with Hisao and quickly making sure she looks good, while starting to see her own beauty."
katawashoujo,38d6sf,TheDwarfLard,7,Wed Jun 3 13:51:20 2015 UTC,"I think this is perfectly reasonable. Hanako's issues aren't her scars specifically, it's how others acted towards her because of her scars. She was ostracized and bullied because of her looks. In her route (and Lilly's), Hisao and Lilly work with her to get her through that sense of ""non-personhood,"" and she learns that she doesn't need to assume others are going to treat her poorly because of her looks, that there are people who really love her. Notice in the final image of Hanako's good ending, she specifically turns her scarred side toward the people on the street, but is, for the first time, making no effort to hide herself from them."
katawashoujo,38d6sf,thatJainaGirl,2,Wed Jun 3 19:44:58 2015 UTC,That is one of the things I like most about that final CG in her good ending.

katawashoujo,38d6sf,supamesican,3,Thu Jun 4 00:18:30 2015 UTC,"In Hanako's route, she's manages to reach the point of her good ending within 5-6 weeks, partially due to Hisao's involvement, as well as Lilly and Akira and others'. But most importantly, Hanako changed her view of the world, even if only a small part of it. Yes, progress is slightly slow at first, but there's no reason for her to stop and there's no reason why she'd want to stop that soon.  Finally hearing what she's wanted to for so long meant the world to her and dramatically improved her situation. Hanako pushing herself to new limits, as well as receiving love and support from Hisao, Lilly, Akira, and her other friends would easily make this a reality before long."

Air Guitar will always be special to me because it's the song that introduced me to my passion of classical fingerstyle guitar.  2x400m Relay floods my mind with memories of first playing Emi's route with all of its emotions and frisson. It's a bit of a tradition to play it before going on my morning runs.  Friendship and Innocence in my opinion are the best composed songs in the KS repertoire. So simple, but from playing jazz and blues for years, I've learned that simple can sometimes be the best form of expression. I get butterflies in my stomach from just listening to them. I'd also put Romance in Andante and Breathlessly in this category.  And of course you can't forget Red Velvet, even if it was heavily inspired, almost to a fault my Hymn to Freedom. Of course, music is all about letting other works inspire you, and that's what KS is all about.  Hell I could talk about every track in the game, but I feel like that's cheating the purpose of this thread :P"

katawashoujo,38aymm,Valjean_Lafitte,7,Wed Jun 3 02:32:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, nothing that terrible happened in the other routes. According to Suriko, Lilly and Hanako's writer, that event was seen as overshadowing the rest of the game, and the aftermath would have been nightmarish to try and write properly.   Why did the idea of Misha committing suicide get dropped? Did the team feel it was distasteful?  The decision was mostly up to A22, being the writer for her path. It was largely seen as overshadowing the rest of the game, and the aftermath was nightmarish to try and write properly. It was simply such a dramatic thing to happen that the path, and to an extent the entire game, would have that event hanging over it."
katawashoujo,38aymm,Joby05,2,Wed Jun 3 04:16:35 2015 UTC,"It was largely seen as overshadowing the rest of the game   That sounds a lot like the other writers telling him to take it out because it was a huge moment in the game that made all of the other routes feel a bit lackluster (which I 100% agree with, after Shizune's pre-release I did feel exactly that).  As far as the aftermath was nightmarish to try and write properly I don't know how I feel about that either. I was pretty happy with how A22 handled it in the pre-release, and I imagine it took him a LONG while to completely rewrite the arc. If he had spent that time polishing up and refining the beta version I can only imagine how epic it could have been."
katawashoujo,38aymm,TheDwarfLard,2,Wed Jun 3 06:21:39 2015 UTC,"But if A22 wasn't happy with that version, as Suriko said, spending more time on it likely wouldn't have changed it. If he (A22) decided is was better to do that, then it was likely better to do that. Impacts like that can be achieved spoiler  Remember one thing: You write for yourself, not for others. So, if A22 changed Shizune's route because he felt like it was the correct decision (if he hadn't, I doubt he'd be telling people how foolish they are for saying they like Shizune's character, but not her route, and telling them how to approach the route instead). No one could have forced him to change it. Perhaps the others told him they weren't so sure about it and he re-examined everything, coming to the conclusion of changing the route. Other people, especially those who you are working closely with, giving advice like that isn't harmful. Yes, you write for yourself first, but another perspective can easily point out weaknesses that the writer missed."
katawashoujo,38aymm,Valjean_Lafitte,2,Wed Jun 3 15:30:50 2015 UTC,"That sounds a lot like the other writers telling him to take it out because it was a huge moment in the game that made all of the other routes feel a bit lackluster (which I 100% agree with, after Shizune's pre-release I did feel exactly that).   Huh? That's not it at all. The writers have gone on record as saying that they each had complete control over their own routes. Even if none of the other writers liked Misha's death, I doubt they could have pressured A22 into scrapping it.  While it's true that it would have overshadowed the other routes dramatically, that does not mean that the other routes felt lackluster in comparison. I'm sorry, but you're reading something into Suriko's comment that isn't there.  The real reason Misha's suicide was cut was that it was too dark a thing to happen to a character who appears in every single route:   It was simply such a dramatic thing to happen that the path, and to an extent the entire game, would have that event hanging over it.   If the pre-release was canon, imagine how depressing it would be to run into Misha, knowing how depressed she is? Sure, she likely won't kill herself in the other routes, since Hisao isn't there to take Shizune away from her. But Misha's main purpose, when she appears in other routes, is comic relief. You're not supposed to feel sorry for her every time you see her, you're supposed to laugh... because she's Misha. She's sad enough in the final route that, as a dramatic device, suicide is unnecessary. For the poor soul that played Shizune's route first, her suicide would indeed have been hanging over the whole game (it  as nothing even remotely that dark happens in any of the other routes."

I'm enjoying it so far -- all three of the main characters differ from their final versions in surprising ways -- but I have to say, A22's early writing ranges from 'poor' to 'decent'. I hope it gets better in Act III."

I've heard that he may have been the one who leaked it the beta, but it's never been proven."

katawashoujo,38aymm,Joby05,3,Wed Jun 3 01:22:52 2015 UTC,"You're basically telling my story. I LOVED Emi in my first play through, but something always felt off about her (likely the lolicon CGs). I also loved Shizune as a character but just didn't like her story. It lacked the romance of the other routes.   As far as pre-release Shizune... you're 100% correct. Amazing story, passion, romance, enough background about Shizune to understand her motivations and help you truly understand her. Then of course Misha! One thing I liked about the Misha arc was that A22 wasn't afraid to embrace a little darkness. It was a refreshing angle to take (especially after reading several other VNs that also explored darker elements).  As far as the story changing, I have heard A22 may have leaked the pre-release because he wasn't happy with how the final game turned out. Considering he was part of a team my bet is that he really liked the pre-release story but was forced to change it because it was too dark? I don't think anyone can truly answer that question but that would make sense considering how Shizune's story generally got poor reviews and most of the people I've talked to who went back and read the pre-release liked her story a lot more and ended up thinking ""WTF was he thinking changing it""."

katawashoujo,386lhd,bubeez,5,Tue Jun 2 05:37:20 2015 UTC,"Awesome writing and some goddamn feels too.  The only thing that could make this better IMO is changing Kenji's monologue to be more frantic.  Like being able to see Yuuko less and less as time passes slowly drives him further into paranoia and despair.  Maybe a conspiracy about why he's losing his sight.  That would've made the story even more hard-hitting.     Amazing writing though, and I'm not really one to judge bc I haven't written anything.  I like the details with the scarf and Kenji pulling books out, and the prose."

Unless he only started being nutty much later…  Kinda sad if he went from this to the guy we see in the game.  On a technical note:   It seems that my eyes saw what it wanted, what it needed, what it had been holding on for during those long, drawn out days in the library.

katawashoujo,382yk3,Tekidek,6,Mon Jun 1 14:16:39 2015 UTC,"Been watching it and... it's interesting. It's very down-to-earth, and while everything looks cute and shiny (in typical KyoAni fashion), it somehow has an air of heaviness to it a lot of the time. It's pretty slow-paced, and its characters and their development are subtle (especially by anime standards), which may lead some (including myself at times) to find it boring. But it has charm. I suspect if you were a band geek in school, you'd pretty much love it instantly, and if you're into slice-of-life shows in general you'd probably like it, but don't expect a happy-go-lucky moeblob like K-On. It has a fair amount of drama, and after episode 8 it seems like it's only going to be getting heavier.  For the time being I like it - it was slow, but it's grown on me, and it seems to be going interesting places. It's refreshing in that it avoids a lot of the typical anime cliches and that it uses a ""show, don't tell"" approach to the drama, emotions, and development of its characters. If you like what you see from pictures, I'd suggest checking it out, but keep in mind that it's slow-going, so if you're not hooked by episode 1 don't necessarily give up on it."

The production values are top-notch (natch, it's KyoAni) and even if you aren't a band geek (as I am not) it still makes you feel like you're getting an inside scoop on the experience.  Also, I feel like it's refreshingly geared toward people who can sit still and pay attention; it's not spoon-feeding you constantly and dumbing down the happenings."

katawashoujo,382yk3,infinitelunacy,5,Tue Jun 2 01:08:33 2015 UTC,"Been watching it. It's pretty good. It's an adaptation of a novel; not a light or visual novel but a full length novel so it doesn't really have the trappings of either. iirc the novel itself was very well received.  As for the plot itself, it's about a concert band and its members. An ensemble cast story about the students facing typical teenage problems. It's all dealt with in a very down-to-earth non-melodramatic way. All while having an overarching story about the concert band aiming to join the national school competition. I do have to say that it might be paced a little slowly, but I like it that way. Animation wise, it's KyoAni, it's always nice to look at.  tl;dr: It's down-to-earth light teen drama about a school concert band. Its low-keyness is contrasted with the KyoAni style of cute."

If you're satisfied with what you read, then that's quite possibly the full experience for you.  As for healing, are there any minor things you don't like about yourself or your situation? If so, attempt to mend those first.  Edit: As for how I handled it: I thought about everything regarding Hanako and her route and knew what I was missing. It's certainly not a simple or easy process and not something I can do by myself, but I've gotten in a better spot since I first read her route around two years ago. Writing down everything (my thoughts and all) recently helped too, I think."

Time can heal part of it (I hope), but as for the emotional part, I think it would take someone else investing in an emotional relationship with me before I can fully grow. I think its more a problem of my emotional growth being stunted by my lack of emotional contact than just being broken but I dont think I can just open up to anyone either."
katawashoujo,384x8f,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"Hanako meant the world to me, but I suppose the interesting aspect is that I'm much more in Hanako's position than Hisao's (but still a bit for him).

katawashoujo,384x8f,Atario,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:10:18 2015 UTC,"I havent played Hanako's route obviously, but what I assume Lilly is to Hisao is even greater in Hisao to Hanako. I see myself as Hisao: a guy with emotional limitations who needs an emotional pillar to lean on sometimes, but identify who I want to be with Lilly: independant, caring, kind but an emotional keel, yet still reliant on the other.

Also, ive read emotional novels (not visual, mind you), but nothing has elicited an emotional repsonse like this from me.

katawashoujo,384x8f,Panory,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:59:01 2015 UTC,I've always agreed as well. I think it might come from the anime vs VN perspective. My brother is a huge anime fan and doesn't like VNs because he doesn't want to replay them. He wants to see 1 complete story and then move on to the next thing. He doesn't like the parallel universe idea and I guess I can understand that. I like to experience the entire story and see it from different angles and compare and contrast the stories.
katawashoujo,38353w,Joby05,7,Mon Jun 1 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"I think you caused yourself to become too irritated with what is more than openly an unfinished product. Correct me if I'm wrong, but part of the reason you went to read Hanako's pre-release first was because you liked Shizune's? You may associate KS with the distaste you could very well have contributed to yourself. There's little to nothing to gain from reading Hanako's pre-release first.  But to be honest, we can't know why you stopped, only you do. Not trying to tell you off, but the way you went about Hanako's route was somewhat foolish, in my opinion."
katawashoujo,38353w,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:00:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah... perhaps there is little to nothing to gain from reading Hanako's pre-release at all honestly. I didn't realize how poorly done it was until I was committed to it... definitely a let down.   Maybe I just don't need to get anything else out of KS. I think I've experienced quite a bit and I don't see myself really being able to relate to Hanako as a character, so maybe this is a logical stopping point. I'll probably get to it at some point but it seems like everything new that comes up excites me far more."
katawashoujo,38353w,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:53:55 2015 UTC,"As much as you like Shizune's pre-release route, it wouldn't surprise me if what that group started with was about just as buggy and incomplete as Hanako's version. The reason why it's more or less in working order for Shizune is because so much focus was put on her route and Hanako has only received some attention. And what's in place there is likely first drafts, since each route had a different writer (save Hanako and Lilly after some time).  I'm fairly certain I've said this before, but the pre-release, especially in the case of Hanako, is to be seen as a 'what-if,' taking the ideas of what happens in Act IV and V (maybe a bit of Lilly's Act III, not Hanako's since they're different) and possibly adapting them to her official route. It was what 4LS was going with at the time, but as with many things, they changed their minds and went in another direction.  You don't have to relate to a character to be able to appreciate their route or even their personality. As a broad example: Overly competitive nature/activities often irritates me, but I can understand why people are that way and why they may like those activities."

katawashoujo,38353w,Sohtak,2,Mon Jun 1 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"He stopped during Act II, I believe, so he wouldn't be reading her route twice, just parts of it (since I think the Act II in the pre-release is similar).   As for the spoilered section, the increase in allotted time definitely made its mark. spoiler"
katawashoujo,38353w,Atario,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:13:25 2015 UTC,"As others have said, I think you got way to caught up on what is openly a flawed and unfinished product.  I've never played the KS alpha...You know why? Cause it's unfinished and filled with old ideas that didn't work out.  Sure I think it's fun to look at it through screenshots and see how goofy everything was. But that's where I stopped. You seemed to just CLING to the alpha as if it was the ONLY KS version out there.  I'm not picking on you mind you...just saying it as I saw it.   I think you ARE putting off finishing KS but I don't think you should. I tried and eventually caved in and...I guess have a better appreciation for it because of that.   Yes it's sad that once the routes are done they are done...but if you are like me and haven't played it in...God...probably 6+ months? You start to forget the routes (Not entirely) but certain bits. And I certainly plan to 100% it again just to refresh my memory.   I don't think KS is aimed at a younger audience at all. There are plenty of other VNs that do that. KS takes a fairly heavy theme and works with it in a very respectable and adult way, where as alot of VNs don't touch that stuff.  Ex : Nekopara (Love you Nekopara but you are far from serious even if you do have some great....animated scenes...)  Just because KS takes place in a school doesn't mean it's for younger audiences. That would make 97% of all Anime/Manga for younger audiences   (When it's more often the case that it's to remind the adults of the last freedoms they had before life beat them down :S)"

That's probably true. I think the reason I went there is because I was so unsatisfied with Shizune's final story. I enjoyed playing through her pre-realse... it had a story much closer to what I had hoped for after seeing Emy/Shizune/Lilly's final products. I think it is done well and tells a great story... cannon or not I enjoyed my time with it.   You seemed to just CLING to the alpha as if it was the ONLY KS version out there.   That's not true at all. I've always aknowledged Shizune's final story as being good at what it was, a slice of life character study. It lacks the grande romance of Lilly's story or the deep relationship building of Emi's route. It is good for what it is but it isn't a great romance. Her pre-release is. I (and I think other Shizune fans) just wanted more context and to have a great story told for our #1 girl like Hanako/Lilly/Emi fans got.   KS takes a fairly heavy theme and works with it in a very respectable and adult way, where as alot of VNs don't touch that stuff.   I think that's half true. I think they do deal with disabilities (which can sometimes be a bit difficult) and they generally handle it in an appropriate way. One of the good things about KS is that the disability aspect isn't dominating and in some ways you can almost forget about it. For example, in Emi's route: her disability isn't really her issue at all; dealing with the death of her father and learning to let more people in is really the theme. I think minus the inconvenience of not having legs her story might have been very similar if everything was the same except she didn't lose her legs.. Then again, I've read 4-5 VNs since KS and all of them have dealt with deep issues as well (such as rape, incest, death, characters departing from the story suddenly, loss, etc.). I think KS pulled out a lot of the darker themes between the Beta and final versions (I won't spoiler but anyone who has played the pre-release knows what I mean).   I'm not picking on you mind you...just saying it as I saw it.    No worries friend... you aren't the first and definitely not the last. I never get salty about open discussions, there's no point in it. Even if we disagree... doesn't mean we have to dislike each other or be jerks. :-D"

Perhaps to let us narrow down your tastes a bit.  I'm a fan of piano pieces like Painful History, Jitter, Moment of Decision, Cold Iron, etc.  You might more be into stuff like Fripperies or School Days."
katawashoujo,37zmay,Dannflor,1 point,Sun May 31 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I've just been putting on the album and relaxing/doing other things, so I can't remember every track by name. Nevertheless, I made this for you to be more broad and general, not just offer recommendations to me. Just link to whatever you find to be similar to Katawa Shoujo, I'll certainly appreciate it and maybe even enjoy it, and so will other people."
katawashoujo,37zmay,flameleaf,3,Sun May 31 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm... considering how varied the KS soundtrack is, it's hard to find something that really resembles it, but I'll throw in some general reccomendations.  Isaac Schankler's work on the soundtrack for Hate Plus (and Analogue: A Hate Story) is pretty fantastic. Link! Those VNs are also definitley worth playing if you're looking for something similar to KS, too. The subject matter is completely different (people dealing with a dystopian society aboard a generation ship, and you arrive post-mortem), but the feels are about as strong as KS, IMO.  There's also To The Moon's soundtrack. Link! And again, the game itself is definitley worth playing if you're looking for something like KS. ESPECIALLY if Rin's route was your favorite. Uncontrollable feels.  Now for something a bit more upbeat, and rather odd. Sound Horizon. And that song on it's own hardly does them justice, but it's one of my favorites. They make concept albums (musicals, really, considering how much dialogue there is) consisting of multiple suites, and they jump from genre to genre a lot. I know there's some kind of narrative present across their entire discography, but I have limited understanding of it because I don't speak Japanese.  EDIT1: Also, Nujabes. Because Nujabes. How can you not love Nujabes.  EDIT2: Mushishi's soundtrack also comes to mind. Link!"

I have harsh rap, calm rap, heavy metal, light metal, viking metal, electro house, dubstep, electronic instrumental and some pop mixed in, but nothing like the Katawa Shoujo songs, apart from ones by the likes of Juno, which seem more like regular dubstep.  Probably the closest I can offer would be some of the music that is offered as royalty free on YouTube. An example would be TeknoAxe, but most of his songs are closer to Juno's music than they are to those of NicolArmafi or Blue123. But that's my offer :P"

katawashoujo,37rfoi,Parzivus,2,Fri May 29 20:23:30 2015 UTC,I suggest Roll20.net It does pretty much all you need while being completely free and pretty easy to use. All you really need is someone who has a basic understanding of the rules and then just wing it.  Biggest problem is usually getting everyone together regularly.
katawashoujo,37rfoi,SenSenSen,2,Fri May 29 20:25:10 2015 UTC,"Its a lot of fun if you have some friends willing to do it. Just don't get the 4th edition set! The newest version (5th) is a lot more similar to the original, and the fights are quicker; 4th expected you to use miniatures and a board, which slows the game a lot. Regardless of what version you do, it is pretty fun, but it helps to have an experienced friend to play DM as well."
katawashoujo,37rfoi,thatJainaGirl,2,Fri May 29 20:28:02 2015 UTC,I second that. Either 5e for the streamlined approach or 3.5 for the huuuuge and expansive amount of officially released content.

My current character is a 12 year old Tiefling Sorcerer who was abandoned by her parents as an infant because of her demon blood so she grew up homeless and scared and alone and only survived because she could make fire with magic.  Also I have the dumbest idea ever and I'm scared it's not going to work. There's an awesome Pokemon tabletop game called Pokemon Tabletop United and I'm making my own villain team and all of the admins of the team are Katawa Shoujo characters (because the team is obsessed with psychic powers and ESP and I figured a group of people who are physically disabled would probably love to develop psychic powers to make their lives easier) and it's either going to be amazing or the worst thing ever. My party has already met Kenji and they think he's the funniest thing ever. Thankfully none of them have read KS.

There I was, trudging along, dead expression to complement my constant stream of negative thoughts. Even on vacation, life seems absurdly devoid at times. I think anyone that's experienced love at first sight will be keen to agree with me: it's not something that can be felt in any other instance, any other time, any other dimension. There's you, there's the object of your desires and affection, and there's the sudden deep well of emotion that draws you to them, as if you were nothing before that moment.  Colors seem brighter, but all you can do is focus on her deep, auburn hair, carefully curled at the ends.  Sounds seem harmonious, but all you can do is hear the slight accent in her voice, soothing yet effortless. You wish you could tell her that.  You can begin to sense the warmth of things, where it was previously unfelt. The sun hits you stronger now, in a rejuvenating sense. But you would give up that feeling, no matter how lively, to hold her hand in the rain; less warm, but all the more powerful.  If I had to directly relate it to any feeling, it would be of a childhood memory. A snapshot of a better time, that you are able to realize for a short moment, before all the terrifying context and background of being a conscious adult has weighed you down. And, standing in public, you stop and smile, smile like that child you're remembering, like an idiot, stepping aside from your life for a moment, and become truly enlightened as to what 'happiness' meant again."

My family is largely olive-skinned and apparently sun-resistant so it just wasn't an issue.  Until one year... After high school I stayed with some people in Las Vegas. Heat and sun didn't seem an issue to me (comparable to what I grew up in) except it was dry. Dry dry dry. But one day it was a great temperature and breeze so I figured I would go sit by the pool for a bit. Not until after a good swim first though of course.  Swim swim swim fun fun fun. Time to relax for a bit and darken up a little bit (and naturally dry off). Having long hair, it being hot, and of course because swimming, I had it back in a long pony tail fastened multiple times (to keep it tidy and not blowing around). Lay on back for a bit, sun feels good. Roll over to get the back a'cookin'. Next thing I know I wake up. Don't feel so relaxed now.  After gingerly grabbing my towel and shirt, I head back to my room to assess the situation. Vegas being Vegas, the bathroom had a full length mirror. Lo and behold, a nice lobster red back. Except for straight down nearly the full length of my back where my hair was. A nice light, comparatively, white stripe. What an awkward summer it ended up being.  tl;dr - made myself Pepé Le Pew bait"

Whether it was because it had washed off in the ocean water or I just did it wrong, I don't know. All I know is, the next day my legs were so burnt I literally couldn't move. I spent three days in bed with my legs wrapped in towels soaked in ice water. Trying to stand on them was the only time I've ever screamed from pain, and I mean screamed. My Hanako style burns aren't nearly as bad right now, they just feel warm to the touch and are like red and peeling.   Sunburns hurt, yo! Hope your back wasn't that bad, I wouldn't want anyone else to feel how I did, and a back burn must have been so much worse!"
katawashoujo,37rfoi,Dannflor,1 point,Fri May 29 21:45:33 2015 UTC,"My back wasn't nothing $40USD worth of aloe vera gel couldn't fix. Had sunburns and peeling before but that was not what my back was that year. People were worried I might have had sun poisoning. No idea if really did or not, just kept applying gel as recommended and made damn sure to keep my hair off my back. That faint prickly tingly raspy tickle... urg.  And I just realized that I almost exclusively have my hair pulled forward over my left shoulder during summers now and that sunburn is probably why. Have you considered sun hats? I can't imagine being that pale but if I don't go outside soon, i'll probably be close. -.-"
katawashoujo,37qnzm,ChihuahuaGod,11,Fri May 29 17:00:15 2015 UTC,"Certain scenes wouldn't change much (much of Act I and even some later), but the vital scenes wouldn't be the same. You'd still get the impact from reading, but the music amplifies that."
katawashoujo,37qnzm,TheDwarfLard,10,Fri May 29 17:01:46 2015 UTC,"It'd definitely lose a lot of it's power. The fact that music, even if you don't realise it, in this game is very well used.   When you first meet each girl, a different song plays, which shows they're all different people and kind of allows you to see some personality (except for Hanako, as her song Painful History doesn't play, and instead Everyday Fantasy does) of the girl.   When you're about to make a tough decision, the music that has been playing the whole time cuts out to silence, and you're left knowing that what you do will change the tide of the game.  When something is really sad, like the Painful History Hanako scene (no spoilers) or something is really dramatic, like the Emi Dinner scene (no spoilers), the music that plays there is very much a clear representation, and shows the full power of the emotions at play, rather than just having girls with faces and dialogue.  The music in the game is SO GREAT, seriously. If you haven't downloaded the soundtrack to iTunes or Spotify or whatever, do it. It's a brilliant investment."

I loved it (and Rin is still my favorite girl and favorite route), but playing through later with music and sound was waaaay better, and my second Rin read, this time with sound, was much better than the first.

My question is about what Miki brings to Hanako route specifically, because she does not show up in other routes (according to Wikipedia, anyway) As others have pointed out, Miki might have been used to reinforce the idea that Hanako appears unapproachable to her classmates."
katawashoujo,37rrmd,Joby05,4,Fri May 29 22:29:09 2015 UTC,She doesn't really bring anything other than being an extra character who has dialogue with Hisao. She is like Emi's mother.

Both of these ideas were later combined and released as Summer's Clover.   What brought Miki to Hanako's route was probably that Suriko is really fond of the character and still wanted to include her somehow. IIRC she was a late addition."
katawashoujo,37rrmd,Reqqles,14,Sat May 30 06:08:38 2015 UTC,"She's there to be much more interesting than Hanako of course.  I kid, her telling Hisao about her failed attempt to befriend Hanako can be seen as a sign that Hanako is interested in Hisao, since she's letting him get close to her.  Aside from that, when I first went through each route in KS I did think it weird that Hisao's contact is so limited. I realize it was simply easier on the devs to limit his social interactions, but I like that Miki is an exception to that, reminding the reader that Hisao transferred into a new class, not just a tea drinking group."

As far as her presence in the actual game goes though, yeah, she's just a minor character.

Additionally, Hisao comes to the same conclusion of considering a relationship with Hanako either way. After all, he's simply telling someone yes or no to that question, not to himself, since he at least likes Hanako by that point.  Her main purpose is to further drive Hisao towards Hanako in a way, and to let him know that others have tried to be friends with Hanako, but have always failed."

katawashoujo,37gknq,TheDwarfLard,6,Wed May 27 13:56:12 2015 UTC,"Artist = twrlare  Colored by me.        I don't know why I expected anything less from Kenji when he decided to join the newly-created science club. He seemed interested in the material when it was just the two of us, but that quickly faded away when a third person joined. Normally Kenji would relentlessly talk to me about the feminist conspiracy outside of class, often in proximity to our dorm rooms. But this new member, someone from my class that I can't say I've talked to very much, if at all, instantly caught Kenji's attention. It's not as if he knows where this new member's dorm room is, so he's going through what must be his regular process right now.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, Mutou is out today and he put me in charge, but how am I supposed to stop Kenji? The main problem is that he's somehow working the current subject into his feminist conspiracy, as I'm positive is the case with other topics. If we were to discuss nuclear fission, it's not as if I don't know what will happen. Actually, even worse is that the student he's talking to, Taro, I believe his name was, is actively eating this information up. I can't tell if either this is just the way he's learning it or he actually believes Kenji. This… this will need to be addressed later.  As I rise from my desk, it creaks… loudly. Kenji quickly turns to face me, not that he can actually see me.  ""Is everything okay over there, man?""  Looks like I'm not getting out of this easily.  With a hefty sigh, ""Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. Just getting up to look outside.""  ""Don't look too long. Never know when their forces are going to strike. Why do you think I took so much care to cover the windows in my fort?""  ""Thanks for the warning."" I really doubt he can sense the sarcasm.   ""No problem. Bros need to look out for each after all."" Guess not.   With that, Kenji quickly turns to face Taro again in the back corner of the room. Looking outside, it's not what I'd call a pleasant day. Showers have been passing overhead for at least an hour now, so it's not as if going out is the best of options. Though, the petrichor is particularly soothing. I think today is just going to be one of those lazy days whenever this 'meeting' is over. Even if I could leave, Hanako said she was busy with newspaper club activities, but refused to say anymore, and it wouldn't surprise me if Lilly was busy as well. Looks like I'm stuck with these two for the next half hour, but at least they're not bothering me that much.  I begin to saunter back to my desk when Kenji and Taro start showing their more boisterous side. Yet, at the same time, I can just barely make out a sound coming from the hallway. Is it Mutou, coming to save me from the perpetual boredom? No… the footsteps are too rapid, but soft at the same time. Then, they cease. A minute passes before I can a familiar head of hair begin to appear from the hallway. It's… Hanako. As soon as she spots me, her apprehensive expression dissipates and transforms into a sweet smile. Arms behind her back, she enters the room. I get up to greet her, but quickly check to see if Kenji is preoccupied with Taro. Thankfully, he is. I don't know why, but she has a flower in her hair. It's cute, to say the least.  When the gap is closed, she pushes herself up with her feet, and we share a brief but gentle kiss. No one else, save us, can feel it, but that kiss alone significantly brightened the classroom. Everything was bleak and dull, but now it's full of life and activity. Well, at least that seems like. And if I didn't know any better, I'd say our kiss lifted Hanako off of her feet. Neither of us fully understand love yet, but I wouldn't want to learn its nuances with anyone else.  ""That flower goes really well with your hair. Do you have any others?""  Hanako shakes her head. ""No, Natsume gave it to me because she wanted me to express myself better with what I wear…""  ""I thought you were busy with them. Did you guys finish early?""  ""N-Not exactly…"" It's not difficult to tell she wants to say more. I nod for her to continue. ""We finished next week's paper early, so Natsume and Naomi wanted to have a party. I-I made some chocolates for them.""  Never knew she experimented in other fields of cooking too… ""Was there any left? You know I'd love to try some.""  She shakes her head, but her expression is difficult to place. Hanako looks upset that she doesn't have any left to share with me, but there's sly smile that just about anyone else would miss. Before long, she begins to fidget with whatever's behind her back, looks at her feet, and must be building up her courage to say what she wants. It almost pains me to see her like this. I've always said she can tell me anything she wants and I'll listen.  Before starting, Hanako takes a deep breath. She takes a small, heart-shaped box out from behind her back, attempts to hide her face with it, and I can just make out that she's doing her best to avert my gaze. This isn't what I expected and I feel like I should be slightly disappointed because she stressed herself over this, but… I can't stay angry with her, not even for a bit. Especially when she mentally went through a lot just to reach this point.  Hanako's timidness is still getting the best of her, however. ""I-I-I made these sp-special for you and... I hope you l-like them."" With that, she holds up the box even higher, completely occulting her face. I wonder if such a thing is possible…  I reach out and lightly grasp the bottom of the heart-shaped box, gently pulling it down until her face is in full view again. She puts up no resistance. Moving in closer, I place my left arm around her waist, pulling her in to close the remaining gap between her. As I do so, the flowery smell of her hair washes over me. It's very subtle, which is likely why it wasn't noticeable before. I look directly into her eyes, wearing the brightest smile I have, and do so until she does the same. When Hanako does, we both close the distance until our lips meet once again. Seconds laters, there's a source of soft pressure on my back. Seems like that's what she needed to boost her confidence. And if I get to kiss my girlfriend more often, I have no complaints. We didn't get together that long ago and with everything she's told me, I'm willing to give her the time she needs.   Hanako wipes away the tears that were starting to form from before as I bring the topic at hand up again, ""I can't wait to try them."" ""Sorry…"" She must have forgotten. ""Here.""  Examining the box more closely, it's complete with a green bow and my name down the middle. I slowly lift the cover off to reveal that Hanako neatly arranged the chocolates inside, even go as far as to place each in individual sections. On the inner side of the cover, there's a small note that is unmistakably Hanako's writing. There's quick summary of why she made the chocolate, starting as a mini project for the newspaper club, but the ending is what really sticks out to me. It reads, ""I know I don't do very much for you and I don't get you many gifts while you always have something for me. I'd like to change that, if I can. I love you with all my heart, Hisao."" I'm… I'm starting to tear up myself now.  Hanako looks on in anticipation, so it wouldn't be advisable to make her wait any longer. I quickly wipe away the tears with my sleeve, select a piece at random, and pop it in my mouth. It starts to melt fairly quickly, but then the recognizable taste of dark chocolate, along with several fruity flavors. The only way to describe the sensation is through one word: bliss.  Remembering that she's waiting for a response, I tell her my exact thoughts. I'm not sure if I could have made her any happier today. However, there's one more topic that does need to be addressed. Opposition is unlikely, and even if it does occur, it's not like this is particularly important.  ""Hey, Kenji? I'm going to be heading out early. You two seem content talking over there and I feel as if I'm just disturbing you.""  ""You sure, man? We could always use another person who's experienced as much as you did in these dark times."" I hastily move to tell him it's important and that I need to leave.  ""Well, if you say so. Keep your eyes peeled for their spies.""  ""Noted.""  With the rest of my current responsibilities taken care of, Hanako and I head outside and quickly make a break for the girls dorm, not wanting to become any more soaked than necessary. She takes a few seconds to just look out into the rain from the safety of the building before walking to meet back up with me. Normally I'm the one to offer activities to do between the two of us, but this time, Hanako speaks up first, even if it's only a whisper.  ""Can we play a game of chess and then c-cuddle for a bit until Lilly's ready for a tea party?""  ""Of course. You've been besting me the past few games, but I think I may finally have found your counter.""  And thus the spirit of friendly competition sets in before the match even starts."

katawashoujo,37g9am,EinsteinReplica,2,Wed May 27 12:14:27 2015 UTC,"You made many interesting points.  I should have taken notes and paused, because I can't remember most of the things I wanted to say now.  You should play Kenji's route.   It's not as silly as you think it may be.  You said that Lilly and Hanako's routes should be combined. Is that because they are so parallel? Or something else?  Personally I do wish they were a bit more distinct from each other.  (Since I played Lilly then Hanako, it really felt like I was playing the same route, but cheating on Lilly.)  Lilly: (Best girl)  Yes she does change, though it's not explored too much.  It's mostly the way she treats Hanako.  The good ending is a bit rushed.  It could have been fleshed out a bit.  Hanako: yes, not long enough.  Other than that, I don't have much to say about her.  I don't get why people love her so much.  Rin: agreed for the most part.  her good ending ends with Hiaso's major character development.  It would have been so much better to see what happens afterwards for the payoff.  Emi: we mostly agree.  Though I didn't like hiaso's development in her route.  Shizune: she is dominant. (Why she ties you to a chair, for example.)  When you get on her route, she makes the decisions, not you. She's effectively playing the game, and you are along for the ride.  You make ONE choice (Misha) on her route, and that's because she isn't around.  I liked how her route takes the longest in-game time, and you see a little more interaction with the other girls than the other routes have.  (One of my one complaints of KS is the lack of interactions with the other girls once you choose a route.)  As for the fairy tale ending, you can understand why they went that direction if you play the pre-alpha.  You should play the pre-alpha script.  Yes, it is unfinished and glitchy, but the storylines are interesting.  Rin and Emi's storylines are similar to the final version, but the others are different, some vastly so.  There is an interesting character pairing that you might be interested in (not the one mentioned below)  The letter: yeah, I liked that unifying event that takes different turns depending on Hiaso's state of mind.  I wish there were more like that.  Akira: I didn't like her as much as you.  Yuuko: I really liked her more than you.  If she had her own route, she would be the best girl, I think.  Kenji: comic relief? Kinda.  I just wish they did more with him.  Kenji and Yuuko: In the pre-alpha script they were in a relationship in the past.  In the final version, they only hint at it. (This is the only pre-alpha spoiler that I'll say)  The Nurse: I also liked him.  Too bad he is really only in act 1 and emi's route.  I feel that Hisao didn't pay enough attention to his heath in any route other than Emi's, and The Nurse could have been helpful in that regard.  Ehh, that's about it I think."
katawashoujo,37g9am,Morlok8k,3,Wed May 27 22:24:02 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself on this, but will attempt to explain why I love Hanako and her route so much.  The simple fact that someone is able to take interest in her, before she even changes much, when people have neglected and verbally abused her for the past ten years is quite powerful. For people similar to her, they may feel like there's no one who could possibly care about them, but seeing how he actually does become interested in her and slowly begins to like and then love her is something that speaks out against that belief. Yes, he messed up at times (good intention, but terrible execution at times), as did Hanako, but that further shows that even if mistakes are made by both parties, it's not necessarily the end. Hisao could have just thought that she wasn't worth the trouble and not bothered with her, but he didn't.  If anything, it's a message of hope for those who may feel similar to Hanako: their life is on-hold and they feel powerless to change anything about the world or themselves. It also shows that accepting help from others is okay and they don't need to do everything alone. There could very well be a patient, kind, and loving person out there for these people and it displays that.  Her route is too short, but it also makes complete sense why it ends where it does. For Hanako, the trouble isn't really in maintaining a relationship, but it's reaching the point where one is possible. With how her good ending is, they both show that they're willing to try and be patient with each other. Hanako's process of becoming more sociable isn't going to be a quick one; there may be bouts of progress, like joining a club, but neither Hanako's route nor Lilly's are the perfect solution. Her own route sets her up incredibly well to make progress, considering if she ever feels down or something didn't go as planned, Hisao can be there for her and remind her that it's okay to fail, since she did try. She doesn't need to do all that alone, having a loving and caring boyfriend (Hisao) by her side only helps in the end. Despite the nature of some people, humans aren't exactly independent creatures: Many (not sure I can say all) of us need some sort of interaction with others to remain healthy and/or sane. Shy people may be able to last longer without that, but they're going to need it eventually. Additionally, I think if more can be addressed sooner rather than later, that's a better setup as well. And don't forget that Lilly's route is considerably longer than Hanako's, so you don't see all that progress. Simply put: These things take time."
katawashoujo,37g9am,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Wed May 27 22:43:55 2015 UTC,"I fully understand what you say about her route and character development and all that.  She just never appealed to me.  Hisao's attraction to her never felt real, but forced.  Maybe whishy-washy?  I don't know.  But nothing in her route really grabbed me or seemed to grab Hisao (so I could try to understand his attraction)."
katawashoujo,37g9am,Morlok8k,3,Wed May 27 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"Well, at first he wanted to help Hanako and just enjoyed spending time with her. Later, as early as the beginning of Act III, he starts to think about a relationship (boyfriend/girlfriend) between the two of them. From there, he is kind of undecided on whether he should pursue Hanako further and be her boyfriend or just stay where they are and remain friends. Hisao is at times pretty much focused on the relationship and at others, he just wants to remain friends. This persists until the last few scenes.  As for what grabs his attention, meeting a girl, talking with her for a few minutes at most, and then seeing (or causing) her to run off is something he may want to investigate further. And while he doesn't realize it fully until her good ending, they're actually quite similar, just that Hisao is sometimes a less extreme variant of Hanako."

katawashoujo,37blwf,Murloo,3,Tue May 26 15:46:58 2015 UTC,"Might sound kind of strange, but I'd say just write whatever comes to mind if you think anything can come of it (as ideas). Once you have an idea you like, expand upon it further until you have a more complete story (don't be afraid to scrap things). Additionally, taking breaks to clear your head helps quite a lot sometimes and having another person look at what you've written offers another perspective and ideas you may not have considered. And take as much time as you need, because there's no rush as far as I'm aware.   Hope that's what you were looking for."

katawashoujo,37blwf,bubeez,2,Tue May 26 20:32:21 2015 UTC,"I think one of the first pitfalls of making fanfics is the idea that intricacy= good writing. Fancy, one-sentence paragraphs seems sophisticated on paper, but it can become nonsensical as the words pile on. Start simple, and definitely read your stuff out loud. You'll find the holes in your writing that you might have missed.  If you have a rough draft or anything, you can always send it my way. I'll always do my best to help a fellow contributor."

katawashoujo,379iud,1923327854,7,Mon May 25 23:44:27 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about making these sorts of posts; I enjoy reading them and I don't think I'm alone in that.     Was Lilly ever going to tell Hisao about going to Scotland permanently?      Probably, but it would've been on her own terms. She might have even waited until she was in Scotland to let him know. You're on point for the control freak stuff.     Why didn't Hisao try and call Lilly or Akira when they had just left from Shizune's house?      I would think that he wanted to confess in person, being face to face would be more effective for that kind of confrontation. I kinda disliked Lilly's route for this reason; Hisao was very slow to act and passive during most of it. Lilly is one of my favorite characters, and her problems are a lot more subtle than the other routes, but other than that it isn't very good, at least in my opinion."
katawashoujo,379iud,Parzivus,3,Tue May 26 00:14:14 2015 UTC,"Probably, but it would've been on her own terms. She might have even waited until she was in Scotland to let him know. You're on point for the control freak stuff.   Yeah I think you're right. I see Lilly telling him on her own maybe the night before or the night she leaves. I would hope she wouldn't let the poor guy know over the phone thousands of miles away. Lilly was practically begging for any excuse to stay too, but didn't want to be a burden on Hisao. Lilly would just hide her dilemmas from Hisao because she almost always had to be the one in charge emotionally... you idiot Hisao haha.   I kinda disliked Lilly's route for this reason; Hisao was very slow to act and passive during most of it.   Yeah it is my main critique about the route as well. Once I realized in the final date Hisao wasn't gonna step up to the plate, and was not picking up her signals I just knew it was gonna be a chase her down at the airport or car type of thing, or a depressing ending. I don't think I would of minded the latter if Hisao's regrets taught him a valuable lesson rather than ate him away for letting the girl get away. Not every story has to be a happy ending. It is why I think his condition bailed Hisao out, and from his monologue in the hospital a depressing ending would of been very dark. Which to me thinks Hisao didn't really develop that much as a character at all, or it is a little harder for me to believe he has ""changed"" in the epilogue/final dialogues with Lilly.   Lilly is one of my favorite characters, and her problems are a lot more subtle than the other routes, but other than that it isn't very good, at least in my opinion   I haven't played any other routes. But I think that is a reasonable attitude. I loved Lilly's Act 2 and 3, and Act 1 was fun interacting with all the girls. But Act 4 Hisao was too meh for me to be really happy he got the girl. I hope he has a better personality in the other routes. Lilly was an awesome character tho, Akira was charming as well, and Hanako really grew up/came out of her shell throughout the route. I wish it wouldn't of taken the final hour for Hisao to take an active role in their relationship, and that we could of explored Lilly's relationship with her family more thoroughly rather than being hung up on Hisao's apathetic/passive attitude."
katawashoujo,379iud,Atario,5,Tue May 26 01:50:47 2015 UTC,"Hi, and welcome!  Don't worry, posts like this are always good.    Lilly didn't know herself what she was going to decide.  That's why she kept putting it off and putting it off till it was too late.  She's all about not opposing the wishes of loved ones, and in this case there were two opposing sets of wishes coming from loved ones, so she was lost as to what to do.  Akira finally forced the issue, and then in the conversation with Hisao about it, she let him assume what he would, and it turned out he assumed she wanted to go to her family and leave him behind.  That made the decision for her.  Hisao was as guilty of not asserting himself as she was, and it all (nearly) ended in tears.  I can't imagine leaving a paid service like cell-phone running in a country I'm leaving forever, right up to the moment I'm leaving.  Loose ends like that would be tied up, especially by people as together as Lilly and Akira."
katawashoujo,379iud,Joby05,4,Tue May 26 08:55:34 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the sub! Glad to see that you enjoyed Lilly's route! You'll find, minus Hanako, Lilly is the fan favorite.  Lilly's is a good arc to start or end on since it is pretty cliche (pronounced good but straight forward and with minimal conflict).   Why didn't Hisao try and call Lilly or Akira when they had just left from Shizune's house?    This is a bit of an ""idiot's plot"". If Hisao had talked about his feelings way before she left, or called her on the phone and asked to talk to her, then the author wouldn't be able to throw in the heart attack scene (which is the ""oscar bait"" moment of her route). My major complain in Lilly's route is the pacing. It was mostly uneventful then had all of the action slammed into the last 3 or so scenes of the game.   If you're looking for suggestions on next route, might I suggest Emi. Her route is my favorite and has a lot more ups and downs and overall conflict. I think you'll REALLY enjoy it plu9s Lilly doesn't show up much so you won't have ""missing #1 girl"" withdrawal like you would with Shizune or Hanako."

It was mostly uneventful then had all of the action slammed into the last 3 or so scenes of the game.   Agreed. I think Hisao realizing he is an idiot/the problem is good, but it happens so quick that Hisao's character development seems rushed/hurried or hollow since just 15 minutes ago he was drowning in his own apathy. I like the character development, and the fact that Hisao realizes Lilly had problems too and wasn't a perfect person to put on a pedestal. But I too wish it was spaced out more throughout the final Act 4 rather than an epiphany and frantic chase for his love.   Although one of my favorite lines in the whole path is in the final scenes  ""Lilly: let me cry"" which in three words smacks Hisao in the face with what he needs to do.   If you're looking for suggestions on next route, might I suggest Emi. Her route is my favorite and has a lot more ups and downs and overall conflict.   Yeah Emi was my backup if Lilly wasn't available. But I'm a sucker for blondes with blue eyes, and in my ""blind"" playthrough haha I'm so sorry Lilly. I wouldn't of pushed myself running if a doctor told me not to."

It's another nice slice of life type VN with some hilarious characters. The protagonist is really cold and keeps to himself so he is a bit hard to relate to but he has some major development. The ""dad"" in the family is hilarious and kills me. I recommend this one as well. :-D"

I wasn't including the Fate stuff.... otherwise I would likely NEVER finish. :-P  Also, not sure if you've heard of it but I found the anime Kara no Kyoukai. It is based on a novel written a few years before Tsukihime which has a female Shiki who also has the mystic eyes of death perception. Seems that the author wrote this first and then wrote Tsukihime as a VN instead of a standard novel. Considering the Tsukihime anime wasn't inherently bad but just muddied up the VN's story, I'm excited for this one. :-D"

katawashoujo,379iud,FollowThePact,3,Tue May 26 20:43:12 2015 UTC,"The gripe I have with Lilly's route, is her character doesn't go through much of a change compared to the other girl's route.   I liked how Hisao was being the one fixed, but it was hastily/messily done, and I would of liked to pick at some of Lilly's problems as well. Most of Lilly's problems/flaws seem to be tossed aside or marginalized for the most part in favor Hisao's (which is the theme of the story to me at least). But that is a byproduct of the dynamic of their relationship. Hisao is going to have to take her off the pedestal since it is in Lilly's nature to take command or lead to protect her friends. Until Hisao does that we can't really do anything other than observe her flaws/problems, and Hisao doesn't really get the memo until the final three or four scenes. And we're just left assuming Lilly and Hisao dealt with her problems in the time skip between the hospital and epilogue.   I understand why people like her route because it is a relationship they want or it's a sweet story, plain, but sweet.   Well she does prefer vanilla ice cream. hah. But yeah I see your point. I didn't really like the ""love story"" part with the Scotland dilemma and airport chase. But Lilly and her supporting characters made the the first 90% of the story awesome. I was rooting for Lilly and Hanako more than Hisao throughout much of it."
katawashoujo,379iud,FollowThePact,2,Tue May 26 04:13:49 2015 UTC,"Tiny spoilers for Hanako's route in regards to what you're saying with Lilly:  Hanako and Lilly have very similar routes, which is to be expected because they're so close. In fact, much of Hanako's route is ""Lilly's route but Hisao stays with Hanako instead."" You see a lot of Lilly's tendency to control everything, even when they're essentially out of her control. In fact, she doesn't even tell Hanako that she's leaving for Scotland until about a day before."

So after breaking up Hisao becomes an alcoholic? That doesn't really make sense to me, honestly I see him more as the shrug it off and call up Lilly to see what's up for the weekend type.  Assuming the note she got was Misha's suicide note? Needed to read it over like 3 times to understand that... I thought perhaps I wasn't understanding. Seems a bit off considering it has a generally uplifting tone. I get the author going for jarring but to me it just came across confusing. Also, how did she know Misha was dead? I think the timeline is weird and the characters are all acting out of context. I don't see much of a reason why Misha would be OK in a good ending based story but not in a bad ending based story. Hisao disappears and things can get back to business as usual.  Not going to lie, I appreciate someone having the guts to take the story to a dark place. One of the things I loved about the pre-release. Unfortunately, I think the rest of the story was a little off and muddy, which seems odd since it's so very short."

It takes a lot of reading; too much reader effort and too little writer effort. The Misha note was actually sent before the bad event, but only read after. Also, yes, not enough set-up. That's why its shortness works against it and paradoxically makes it muddier!"

katawashoujo,377qfr,Dannflor,1 point,Mon May 25 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"Just download the soundtrack and give it a listen. It's not terribly long so I'm sure you can figure out which ones you like quickly.  Personally, I can't listen to the KS soundtrack anymore. I associate it too heavily with events from the game. Even the most innocuous of tracks tends to be relevant to some heavy moment in one of the routes."

But in all seriousness I totally understand. I've only known KS for about 1 year now (Coming up in June) and I haven't stopped caring or talking about the game since. I've beaten each route at least 2 times, listen to the soundtrack, look for new fan-art and any KS related stuff that might pop up who knows where on the internet.  Currently trying to write a fan-fic myself of KS but...we'll see how that goes.   KS is very special to me as I can tell it is to you, so don't ignore those butterflies in your heart...listen to em, act on your emotions :)  We could always use more people here with us and infact welcome it! So no life with the rest of us and fawn over KS for eternity! Doesn't sound too bad right?  All girls are best girls (Especially Hanako)"

AFAIK, the only route that's more or less complete in the latest pre-release version is Shizune's, but the fact that any route is near completion in what is an unfinished product by definition is something. There's 3 of them and you have them all. Personally, the beta has nothing to offer that the pre-release doesn't, so don't bother.  Grid1 is incredibly early and it shows. Even the pre-release is quite rough in areas. I'd do oldest to newest, but skipping the beta, so Grid1 then pre-release. For both versions, just be patient."
katawashoujo,376gth,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Mon May 25 07:34:29 2015 UTC,Grid1 then pre-release   Thanks!  Is it true that some parts are bugged out and I'll have to open an editor? (Is that RenPy or smth? I haven't used the editor before but I should be able to figure it out)
katawashoujo,376gth,TheDwarfLard,2,Mon May 25 07:37:27 2015 UTC,"Both of those versions have worked fine for me. The beta (which isn't worth looking at, having the pre-release) doesn't work by itself, but would with a bit of effort. Ren'Py is the engine KS (and numerous other VNs) run on. I wouldn't worry about it, since Grid1 and the pre-release run fine (sometimes with some bugs, but that's to be expected)."

katawashoujo,374dts,briigh7blade,15,Sun May 24 19:42:14 2015 UTC,Each series would have to be a different route.
katawashoujo,374dts,Dannflor,10,Sun May 24 20:20:41 2015 UTC,Clearly the only appropriate genre for KS would be a harem ecchi. Hisao gets ALL THE GIRLS! <3
katawashoujo,374dts,Joby05,-7,Sun May 24 19:58:36 2015 UTC,Haha. I said anime not hrntia
katawashoujo,374dts,PaperAirship,12,Sun May 24 21:18:08 2015 UTC,"First off, animated by KyoAni, because personal bias, and because they have successfully done VN adaptions in the past.  The two-cour, twenty-five episode KS anime would be set up like this:  Episode one is the Act One. It establishes Hisao's condition, Yamaku, and introduces the main girls, as well as some of the choices that lead up to a particular girl's route.  Each girl's route would be a four episode arc, starting from the second half of Act One, and then continuing with the route until it's completed.  After each route, one of the remaining four episodes would be played, which is Act One again, but with different choices that lead up to a different girl's route. Like a Endless Eight, but better because there's actual changes in each one, and there's a four episode gap where stuff happens between every ""reset"".  BD exclusive OVAs would be the Kenji ""Good Route"", as well as the Harem Ending.  The feature length movie would be an Original route, perhaps featuring Misha, or one of the non-canon characters."
katawashoujo,374dts,NixonsRevenge,-1,Sun May 24 21:12:44 2015 UTC,I would pay kickstarter for this. But i still recon hisao can be replaced for other girls to allow the whole thing to play as one story.
katawashoujo,374dts,uss1701jb,15,Sun May 24 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"Hisao would end up with Lilly or Emi. Maybe Emi at first, he screws up, goes out with Lilly, Lilly leaves for Scotland, he ends up back with Emi. Rin would be there as more of an emotional support and will probably mention how he doesn't smile, gives him a hug, philosophies on Jellies, etc. Kenji, how fun, add a side story with him and Yuuko or someone else. During his time with Lilly (which would last over summer at least) they'd end up at Shizune's place and Jigoro will have his day in the spotlight. Maybe Misha will kill herself like in the pre release and causes some drama. Add some other characters as side characters with their own stories. Hanako becomes famous for her singing ability. Sorry if I missed anyone, just shooting around ideas..."
katawashoujo,374dts,Crowst,2,Sun May 24 20:22:14 2015 UTC,Maybe Misha blah blah blah /u/uss1701jb is lazy   That sounds fun! And by fun I mean  whhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
katawashoujo,374dts,grieverx99,1 point,Mon May 25 01:07:18 2015 UTC,There is enough story to work with but i wonder if it would still hit you in the feels as an anime
katawashoujo,374dts,marius_med77,3,Sun May 24 22:57:21 2015 UTC,"If competently done, yes. It's a well written story with characters that are easy to identify with and care about. I would prefer someone like Studio FEEL or KyoAni to animate it since it would probably need a lot of subtle facial expressions. We get most of our information about the characters through Hisao's internal monologue, so we need something to convey that same information about the characters' feelings to the audience."
katawashoujo,374dts,TheDwarfLard,10,Mon May 25 04:31:50 2015 UTC,how about something like amagami ss

katawashoujo,374dts,kloiberin_time,4,Thu Jun 4 20:26:52 2015 UTC,"I reckon Emi was good for hisao, i recon a love triangle where Shizune wants Hisao causing rivalry between shizune and emi. The same story for Rin my favourite girl except with a blind musician opposite her where she is drawn to him because of his abillity to express himself but cant she express herself. Dont know about lilly and haniko, perhaps focus on haniko's desperation as she has to lern how to live without her help?"

katawashoujo,374dts,ArtificiallyIsolated,4,Sun May 24 23:14:28 2015 UTC,"Act 1 is easy, you just follow the main plot.  Maybe flesh out some of the other characters, especially another guy or two and give the other teachers a face and a little bit of a personality.  Hisao starts running with Emi.  He's helping out with the Student council but hasn't joined yet.  He hangs out with Lilly and Hanako in the tea room.  He helps Rin work on the mural.  He listens to Kenji's batshit ramblings, and he splits his lunches between playing chess in the tea room, eating on the roof with Emi and Rin, and at the Shanghai with Shizune and Misha.  Act 2 would be parts of all the girl's chapters.  It would basically be Hisao growing closer to the girls as friends.  Halfway though I would have him start a relationship with Shizune.  The trio of Hisao, Shizune, and Misha all travel to her dad's place and events unfold.  (Honestly, I would cut out the sex and make most of it implied or not have Hisao ""make it to home plate"")  Yet when they get back Shizune grows distant.  Shortly after they drift apart.  Hisao starts running more and hanging out with Emi and Rin.  Not wanting to go back to Student council he mentions having a lot more free time.  Rin offhandedly mentions the art club and Hisao decides to try it out.  Meanwhile Hanako is missing class.  He calls Lilly (who I should have mentioned would be in Scotland at this point) for advice.  He now spends his mornings running, after school he's in art club, and on the way back to the doom he stops in to check on Hanako, all while keeping in contact with Lilly about her condition.  Rin and Hisao become closer through the art club and the groundwork for a relationship starts to form until Rin accepts the gallery show.  She eventually tells Hisao that she needs to be alone.  Hurt for a second time Hisao throws himself back into running and trying to help Hanako.  Lilly is back by this point in time.  It soon becomes apparent that both Lilly and Hanako have feelings for Hisao, but due to her timid nature Hanako backs off allowing Hisao and Lilly to become closer.  Sadly the time comes for Lilly to leave for Scotland.  With Lilly out of the picture Hanako for once in her life tries her hand at happiness and makes a move on Hisao.  Unfortunatly, white knight Hisao doesn't allow her advances.  This leads to her explosion in the dorm room.  The only friends he feels he has left at this point are crazy Kenji, and Emi.  Emi, not having Rin to pal around with welcomes more time spent with Hisao.  The two eventually realize the feelings they share for each other and start a relationship.  (Emi might be the only one that I keep the sex in.  I wouldn't go full H-scenes, but Emi's sexuality is a big part of who she is, and the issues that she has.)  But like the game, Emi eventually grows distant.  This blows up at dinner with her mother and once again Hisao is alone.  A classroom conversation with Misha finally makes the point that the Nurse, Yuuko, and Mutou try to make throughout the game.  Stop making such a big deal about everyone's issues, both physically and mentally.  Hisao finally realizes that he needed to ask Lilly to stay, or view Hanako as a person instead of a broken china doll.  He needed to push forward and make Rin, Shizune, and Emi talk to him, and for him to actually listen.  Hisao goes on a whirlwind tour to fix his friendships.  He starts talking to Lilly on the phone.  He apologizes to Hanako.  He shows up at the art show and helps Rin through her breakdown and walks around town with her.  He confronts Shizune and then Misha and makes the three of them work things out.  He tells Emi that he can't promise to always be there, but when he is he will always lend an ear or just sit and talk with her.  Once all the issues are solved and he friends with the girls I would have something happen.  Some sort of event that sends Hisao back to the hospital like in the end of Lilly's chapter.  He opens his eyes and sees the doctor who tells him he's had many visitors but one young girl in particular stayed by his side as every day.  A door is heard opening, Hisao smiles and says, ""I was hoping to see you.""  End.  Basically I would have Hisao dip into a relationship with each girl, but not let them progress past the first or second issue.  He would still interact with the girls throughout the series, but wouldn't reform those bonds until the end, and then I would leave the ultimate choice of the relationship up to the viewer."

katawashoujo,374dts,MiraiSuenaga,2,Sun May 24 22:34:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want a set love interest. I think it'd cheapen the build up...instead, I'll take an anime that compresses his year at Yamaku into 26 episodes, where he slowly builds friendships with each Main girl, maybe the occasional little moment of ""Do we...feel that way about each other?""  Give me 3-4 episodes of Hisao settling in, meeting the main cast and a small group of secondary characters. Kenji developing into his best friend from the shut in weirdo. Hisao falling into Miki's group of cool dudes. Joining/managing for the Track Team while avoiding being Shanghaied into Student Council Duty. Throw in Ouran High/Shigatsu style comedy mixed with emotion.  A lot of the big character arcs can be told without the sex scenes from the routes. Misha's entire arc. Lilly moving, Hanako going from meeps and running away to actually conversing in episode ten.   And I'd like for it to end where the story begins for him. Graduation day, a note in his shoe box from a secret crush. Hisao nervously waits under a tree, looks at the figure that approaches, only this time he smiles."

Hisao gets into a relationship with Lilly, but she leaves for Scotland. Hisao and Hanako spend more time with each other as Lilly is missing from their lives. Eventually, they get into a relationship. Misha and Shizune just appear throughout and occasionally say something to him."

Maybe not soccer or, um, anything on the unhappy side of the ""will kill Hisao"" line, but something sporty would be fantastic. Golf, maybe. That's relaxed enough to not be lethal while still being a matter of real skill and physical talent.  Actually, now that I think about it, golf is Scottish, isn't it? This has possibilities. Maybe Lilly wants to explore her mother's heritage and her friends are along for the ride? Hisao's even dressed the part. :D"

katawashoujo,371yl4,Tynaiden,5,Sun May 24 18:24:13 2015 UTC,I think it's natural (and healthy) to lose your interest in KS over time. Many people talk of getting hit with the feels and that empty feeling and how it fades over time. It is good to keep the lessons you learned close to you but I think it's fine to not think about it unless something directly makes you think about it. I think the sub is a great way for all of us to stay connected and remain friends. <3

But years later, some of the friendships seem to have survived in unexpected ways. Because I had many Asian friends, a lot of them came to mind when I was playing KS. Not so much other VNs, because quite often those are pretty artificial.  What you have is a good thing if controlled. Now I'm much older, I find that things like crying and writing daft poetry and whatnot... while I used to think of them as those damn weaknesses, they're now a source of strength, reminding me I'm human and that all of us are flawed. When I write fanfic, it's an attempt to remember that."

The game definitely leaves it's mark on you and likely changes you in amazing ways.   Make you more active, more kind, more forgiving...what have you, it will do /something/ to you.   The emotional scarring stays forever, that's just a fact. I've beaten each KS route at least 2 times. Hell I've played/watched Hanako's route at least 5-6 times and it still gets me. I'm sure the other routes do as well.  It's been....quite a while since I last actually PLAYED KS myself so maybe I will remedy that soon. But I guess the point I'm trying to make is that...KS leaves it's mark on you, it changes you as a person in /some/ aspect of your life.   For me? It gave me direction and ignited my fire for my lifes passion.  Since I can see from others comments that you only recently played it...it's going to stick with you for a while. Some people get over it quickly, some it takes a while...others you get over it but KS is still a major factor/part of your life....like mine.  I'm getting close to the 1 year anniversary of when I found KS and I haven't stopped thinking about it since the days I found it when it was new to me.   I guess (Again) what I'm trying to say is that KS enriches your life. You come out a better person for having experienced it. Sometimes it's good to sit down, play a route of KS and FEEL. So many people forget to do that these days.  If any of that made ANY sense, You'll get what I mean :S"

A therapist or psychiatrist could be more objective about your situation and provide guidance. I went to one when I was depressed and found it was a big help.  If you really have anger issues and depression, that's not something we should be diagnosing and trying to treat over the internet.

It's my own experience, and anybody else's can be different, still I want to share it, but don't take it as standard to decide anything. I've been into five or six therapists in my teenage and adulthood, tried from antidepressants and those flower-liquid-stuff to some past-life bullshit to treat my depression, low degree anthropophobia and serious anger issues. In both orthodox and non-orthodox therapists I noticed they all try to fit you into some ""archetype"" of patient, and after they do that, they'll stop listening to you at all, and try to make you accept you're what they think you are. When I was younger I've had a hard time trying to express myself to my first therapists, I did as best as I could, yet it seemed like they didn't even care. Before therapy, I talked to everyone about my issues, family, friends, and at first they were all like ""you'll get through this"", then it changed to ""you should seek professional help"", and I did that, got nothing out of it, and I'm still frustrated, but found my own way of dealing with everything."

For me, the biggest one was a green-branch fracture that is not a clean break but partially pushed back upon and over itself. The doctors had to put my arm in a traction machine and break the bone. Just get it all the way done. It hurt more but it allowed for better healing and a bond that heals stronger than what it was before.  Honestly though, sometimes we just need to cry to get what the fuck ever things are stuck in ourselves all the way out so we can heal a bit better. I vehemently despise the way the emotions well up and the near nagging feeling of wanting to cry but it happens so rarely and yet in the end, after those cold soft fingers trace my cheeks, great relief and calmness comes afterwards."

It's clear from the way you talk about her that you care deeply for this girl, but it's equally clear to me that her thoughts and feelings are still very much with this other guy and regardless of the scope of your feelings for her (really, only you can figure out how serious this is for you), nothing good can come from pursuing her romantically at this time. She clearly still has to work out this stuff and whatever their history, it also sounds like she's holding out hope that the two of them will reconcile one day.   My advice is to stay away from her in any romantic context. Continue to be her friend as you've been up until now. If you find you are genuinely attracted to her, maybe cut back on your contact with her for a while to give yourself the opportunity to move past that attraction.  I suspect this might not be the answer you were hoping for, but I can tell you there is nothing to be gained from trying to pursue someone so deeply invested in someone else."

She trust you and confides in you but there is another guy that it seems like she's holding out for. Best friend is probably all she wants from you, someone to listen and be there when she needs them most. So be her friend and let her figure out her relationship with her bf(?) and don't get involved in any romantic means.   It sounds almost exactly like a situation I put myself in years ago. However I stupidly admitted my feelings to said girl and our relationship soured pretty soon after. You may have to remove yourself from the situation if your feelings are that strong.

(Found out one of them was a distant cousin due to Ancestry, so kind of a good thing that she did say no. Ha!)  But you know the saying ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."" I think, if you're willing and able to accept that rejection, and it seems like you are, you can move on and continue being friends with her. Of course it's a two way street. She'd have to be able to take it well herself. But there are ways to ease her into that comfortably. To let her know it's okay to say no. That she won't upset you. And that you'd understand. There's also proper timing as well. And I don't mean 20 years later. =P Just, don't just throw it out of left field."
katawashoujo,36z20l,Crowst,1 point,Sat May 23 17:42:10 2015 UTC,"Here is my advice:   All is fair in love and war. Don't worry about the other guy's feelings. That's just an obstacle to overcome. If he doesn't want a relationship with her, why should you worry about it? As far as hurting her, don't worry about that in the slightest. If she falls in love with you she is going to forget that guy ever existed. There will be no mental anguish on her part when you take his place. You need her to be interested in you romantically and sexually. This is the problem with the ""friend zone."" What the ""friend zone"" really means is that a girl doesn't find you attractive. You are not even on the radar as a possible sexual partner. You need a strategy to make her view you as a man. The entire objective of all your efforts should be on this alone. The remainder of my advice will basically be how to achieve this. Be the most attractive version of you you can be. If you aren't in shape, start eating healthy and working out. Buy new clothes. Make sure you are hygienic and well groomed. /r/fitness and /r/malefashionadvice are good subreddits for information and advice. Again, your goal is to make her find you physically attractive. Do you see her in real life or just chat with her? If this is a purely internet relationship, I'm not sure how far it is going to go. You need to be able to interact with her in person to find out if there is any real, long term romantic interest. Meeting in person is a good time for you to flirt with her and make her start looking at you as a possible sexual partner. I could write a novel about how to do this, but honestly I feel like flirting is sort of a natural instinct for guys. The prerequisite is that you are confident though. Hopefully if you are looking your best from step #3 you will feel confident. Even if you aren't confident, do your best to fake confidence. From there just go with the flow. You've probably seen some romcoms, you know the gist. Act like Hisao does with Emi. That's pretty well-written flirting. Are you willing to sacrifice your friendship? There will come a point in time where you will have to finally make a move. You will have to be the catalyst for change in the relationship. If she rejects you, your friendship will probably be too awkward to continue. Are you willing to accept this risk? In my personal experience, a one-sided relationship like this is unhealthy in the long term anyway. You need to eventually make your move (hopefully after wooing her). If she outright rejects you, cut ties and move on with your life. Don't waste your life chasing after an unobtainable girl when there are plenty more out there. We only have a small amount of time on this planet and youth is fleeting.   Hope that helps some. Good luck!"
katawashoujo,36z20l,Crowst,2,Sat May 23 12:24:53 2015 UTC,All is fair in love and war. Unless the one I am hurting is the one I love! I don't think I can bring myself to confessing to her cause it would only hurt her! She said it herself that if I stop talking to her like this it would only hurt her as she has already experienced it once of somebody she cares about not being able to have any contact with. Doing this would not only hurt her terribly but me too... I don't think she would have any interest in me. When I first met her I didn't either and we joked about it before that when we first met each other we already drew the line that we won't have any interest in each other... People joke that we were 'cute' for each other and such and we would get annoyed and we would shrug it off but now...Now I feel 'different' and that's whats killing me. Yes I know :) . I do see her in real life. Thats how I met her xD. We just chat alot over the net but we mostly chat about whats happening to us in that current moment. We do plan on hanging out over the summer. Thats the thing I don't think I am willing to sacrifice the friendship I have. She is an amazing friend and I simply can't.   Thanks alot though.

Thats the thing I don't think I am willing to sacrifice the friendship I have. She is an amazing friend and I simply can't.   That's your choice of course. My experience is that it's unhealthy in the long run. If you really want to stay her friend, I would at least find another girl so you can focus your romantic interest somewhere else."

She is too...bound by the fact she likes that other person, that she gets really happy when something happens with him. I don't think she would have an interest to a person she only considers a friend.   That's your choice of course. My experience is that it's unhealthy in the long run. If you really want to stay her friend, I would at least find another girl so you can focus your romantic interest somewhere else.   I understand. Thanks for the help I would think about it greatly. I am just finding myself to be 'between a rock and a hard place'. I am confused of my own feelings, I am not even THAT sure if I 'love' her...I may have feelings for her but do I 'love' her? sigh and on top of that I have to snuff this feelings away so that I don't hurt her, but this would in turn hurt me and I don't want to lose her as friend as she helped me alot and I helped her alot too and we became quite close. It's just so infuriating...  Thanks again."

I don't think she would have an interest to a person she only considers a friend.   Two points:   Women are generally attracted to one guy at a time. If you were to replace him as the guy she was attracted to, his actions and their relationship would cease to have any meaning to her. What would make her happy at that point is what YOU do. You're absolutely right that if she just considers you a friend she is not attracted to you. That doesn't mean you can't change the way she views you. It is possible to shift from friend to lover if you make the right moves.    I may have feelings for her but do I 'love' her?   Why do we love others? What do you want out of love? These aren't easy questions to answer. I'm not sure that anyone has that completely figured out. There are some interesting biological explanations, but they aren't complete in their understanding. Others like to throw around platitudes and proverbs, but those don't really describe actual love either.  That said, without any understanding of what ""love"" is in the first place, what makes you hesitant to say whether you love her or not? Who is to say whether your ""feelings"" are or aren't love?"

katawashoujo,36vh2v,GrandmasterSexay,1 point,Sat May 23 05:39:17 2015 UTC,That's what sort of upsets me. Shizune is an interesting character in her own right and best girl needs more spotlight. But Misha's arc is also pretty neat considering her depression.
katawashoujo,36vh2v,FoxtrotZero,1 point,Sat May 23 07:34:29 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion, Shizune's route is terrible, and it doesn't do either her or Misha full justice as a character. I just don't like the way it's written. If I'm not mistaken, Cpl_Crud walked out in the middle of it being written, so that might be part of why, but that's neither here nor there.  Mild Spoilers  The fact that it only has one actual decision throughout the whole thing is bad from every standpoint. I wrote a whole rant about how that puts the story on rails and that's not necessary. The point I want to make, though, is that when you're not making any decisions, you're not plumbing the depths of the character's personality, and that's a problem inside a VN, because then you might as well be reading a book with nice pictures (and that's not the draw of the medium to me). With some routes, like Lilly, a single wrong choice might fuck you up (them's the brakes) but with others, like Rin's, you have a million paths and the name of the game is ""figure this girl out"".  I can think of some routes that are dreadfully too short cough-Hanako-cough, and we'd all like the routes to be longer, but Shizune's route was actually about two people, and your character exposition suffers from that. You couldn't have a route without them both, not without changing their relationship. That relationship, and the way you have to help them both through it, explains a lot about why they both are the way they are, and helps you understand them as characters.  Or, it's supposed to. I ended that route feeling like I understood Misha exactly as the authors intended, though I didn't consider her very emotionally deep. Meanwhile, I understood Shizune was a complete and deep character, but I didn't even begin to understand her until the end (and it's worth noting she has the interesting quality of changing a lot, at least in presentation, between the beginning and end of her route). I blame the fact that I was tired, marathoning the game over a cold plate of Japanese food, and the complete lack of choices in her route made my attention waver.  And perhaps I'll have to replay her route. We'll see how that goes. I meant to restart Hanako's route, but now I'm in Act II for Lilly. Regardless, even despite my shortcomings, the lack of actual choices to be made in her route, combined with the writing of the interaction between her and Misha, make it really hard to explore her correctly as a character, and that's tragic, because she's pretty interesting when you get to her core."
katawashoujo,36vh2v,TheDwarfLard,2,Sun May 24 06:24:37 2015 UTC,"Cpl_Crud was Hanako's writer (and Suriko picked her up afterwards), so that doesn't make a difference on Shizune. Though, A22 (Shizune's writer) did rewrite the entire thing in the middle of development, so there may have been a bit of rush behind that. There are reasons why you only get one decision in her route, but someone more versed in her route should be the one to address it, not me.   Lastly, people often say that replaying her route leads to a deeper appreciation of her character and/or route, so that might do it for you."
katawashoujo,36vh2v,FoxtrotZero,1 point,Sun May 24 06:41:17 2015 UTC,"Huh. I thought I'd read somewhere that it was the opposite (someone said Cpl_Crud walked out on Hanako and someone else said no, it was Shizune, so I guess I had it backwards).  Anyway, I'll probably replay it eventually. Could use the nostalgia. Like I said, I was pretty out of it at the time, that might be the biggest factor."
katawashoujo,36vh2v,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sun May 24 23:55:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think not being in it completely would a factor that'd take away from the experience. Shizune's route isn't perfect, but just like every other one, it has its moments and aspects that are memorable."
katawashoujo,36vh2v,FoxtrotZero,4,Mon May 25 00:06:31 2015 UTC,"Still, I bet she now has an extra hour and a half in the mornings and no clue what to do with it."

Here's the flowchart for the whole game but the specific scenes are ""a brief history of thyme"" in Act 2, ""prelude"" in Act 3, and ""out and about"" in Act 4.

Any who yes you are a bad person, but in a good way."

I dunno... seems like the people over there dont have much love for KS am most of what I've said has been downvoted tto oblivion. I guess I am spoiled by this community. :-D"
katawashoujo,36w6yp,Joby05,6,Fri May 22 17:31:12 2015 UTC,"I think many of them see KS as an introductory VN, not because it's terrible or anything, but it's just that KS is many peoples' first VN. No visual novel is perfect, but KS did have its share of flaws. They might also be tired of hearing about it. Here, it's just going to be KS and that's assumed from the start. There, it's all visual novels and that space needs to be shared. They might have had far too much KS stuff in the past and this is their reaction or something."

katawashoujo,36w6yp,FollowThePact,2,Sat May 23 02:43:10 2015 UTC,Me neither! AoT was pretty shit.  The pacing for one. It was either balls to the walls action packed Michael Bay-ish where I didn't get hyped for fights anymore or it was like watching paint dry.  Then the art style was incredibly weird to me.  Personally I think the only reason why people liked it was for the gore.

At least that's what common opinion holds, so if you list it among your favourites, be prepared to be picked upon. Other than that, it's fairly decent."

katawashoujo,36w6yp,thatJainaGirl,1 point,Sat May 23 15:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'm subscribed there and interestingly, the most popular games on that subreddit - Umineko, Fate/Stay Night, Steins;Gate, or even Grisaia - are far from ""press the right button to see anime boobs"" games. However, it IS true that KS is not particularly popular, although you will come across a couple of people mentioning it every now and then in the weekly ""What are you reading"" thread. At any rate, they are mostly okay with mentioning/discussing it, but they still seem rather bored of mentioning it, like they've moved on. Most people there aren't new to KS, unlike here where you will find people who've just played it as well."
katawashoujo,36w6yp,Youbiseiharukana,2,Sat May 23 00:15:57 2015 UTC,"I can understand that they can get sick of hearing about KS, since it's many people's first introduction to the genre, but their hostility to someone who had just finished KS and wanted something else was very off putting. I definitely got the feeling that enjoying KS made me unwelcome in the sub."
katawashoujo,36w6yp,thatJainaGirl,1 point,Fri May 22 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's changed then, because I've even noticed a fair amount of people with KS flairs and some people even discussing KS positively. Even in the ""best girl"" and ""best guy"" contests, some of the KS characters made it quite far (although ultimately shoved aside in favor of Grisaia or Fate/Stay Night characters, but that's to be expected)  Also, I'll mention here that I only joined reddit (and therefore that subreddit) a few months ago, and you said you hadn't been there for a few months, so it's possible we haven't seen what the other has."
katawashoujo,36w6yp,Youbiseiharukana,1 point,Fri May 22 21:38:11 2015 UTC,"That's completely possible. Looking at the dates of my first completion of Katawa Shoujo and with the knowledge that I only went to the sub after my first completion, I can guess that it's been about 14 months since I read it. So it's probably pretty different now."
katawashoujo,36w6yp,thatJainaGirl,1 point,Fri May 22 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I only joined maybe three or four months ago. Maybe they just had too much KS stuff and then reacted in annoyance to its mention but now that it's been a while and the references still relatively few, they're a lot more okay with it. Also, I myself had moved on from KS and therefore didn't mind the lack of KS posts. It leaves room for discussing a variety of visual novels (like in the weekly threads), and also new visual novels that people are working on/need funding for/want to spread word about."

I emulated ff6 before and kinda liked it, even though I felt it was tedious. This one I like much better.  I hated the voice acting and dialogue at first, but I've gotten used to Tidus sounding like johnny test and enjoy seeing the characters interact. I'm actually starting to like the story. Also the sphere grid is a cool mechanic."

I don't think any FF game really gets good until about a dozen hours into it, once you're out of ""training wheels and establishing characters"" land. I tried to play FF7 half a dozen times, but it wasn't until I pushed through to the end of the Midgar arc and got to the overworld map that I blazed through the rest in a weekend."

The other one I played, 6, timed you on making decisions so that you'd take extra hits if you took too long to make decisions. So if you needed to use an item, and it your items menu is messy, things get unnecessarily difficult. I like ffx's combat much more, since you aren't timed on your decisions."

katawashoujo,36w6yp,Blindweaponsfumbler,1 point,Fri May 22 19:40:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, well then.  In no particular order I like: Toradora, the 'A Certain Series' like Railgun and Index, both Fullmetal Alchemist and Brotherhood, Chunnibyou series, Candy Boy, Cowboy Beebop. (And the To-Love Ru series, and the Highschool DxD series.)  Plus I gotta give a shout out to my first three anime Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and Inuyasha.  Some series that I started watching recently.... Space Dandy, picking up Bleach again, K-On, Sakura Trick, and Gurren Lagann.  Might even pick up Death Note, heard plenty of good things about that.  However, YLiA isn't really like any of these.  I'll give a little run-down of YLiA.  Main character was basically abused to play the piano by his mother, became like a machine because of his abusive training, won tons of competitions and gain rivals, mother got sick and died, Main character can no longer hear the piano when he plays because trauma, gives up playing the piano for two years, new girl (complete bae) comes into Main character's life, power of boner for new girl is strong.  It has a good art style, wonderful VAs, fantastic music, great plot, and feels. Watch it!"

I love that you can kill high level enemies no matter what level you are as long as you're smart, fast, and patient, unlike other RPGs like Dragon Age: Inquisition.  At the same time, I'm doing all my culminating assignments for the end of the school year, and the two are cutting into each other's time."

Each of us develops our own head cannon, and in my version Lilly goes to England alone, Hanako continues to stay in her shell, Emi doesn't really get over her trust issues, Rin I don't know a thing about and Misha dies. It's like real life man, you can't be with everyone. I think the authors tend to do a good job of preventing you from seeing any of the heartache that the girls on the other routes are experiencing as to not deter you from your current path."

katawashoujo,36oln4,Youbiseiharukana,3,Thu May 21 00:17:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I think if that can be addressed by a caring person (Hisao's intentions are quite good, just his execution can be quite terrible up until the ending) sooner rather than later, then there's more potential. Not to mention that both Hanako and Hisao help each other out by the end of her route, sometimes in ways they hadn't thought of. And do remember what Hanako says during her route's last scene: spoiler  While it's not impossible, keep in mind how many people were repulsed by her appearance and refused to get to know Hanako. Someone else could do what Hisao did, but given that record, it might take a while.  And in my opinion, there's the whole changing because of love being preferred over changing so she can be loved."

Rin's story reached me on a level no other work of fiction ever really has, and even today, over a year after reading it for the first time, I still have to auto-skip through all Rin scenes in Act 1 or I can't go on.

katawashoujo,36ltos,thatJainaGirl,3,Wed May 20 22:19:41 2015 UTC,"Although she's far from my favorite character, for me I would have to say the point in Emi's route where she snaps and shouts at Hisao.  ...Emi fixes me with an icy stare. ""So you want to fix me, Hisao?"" She's definitely getting angry now. ""Wanna swoop in on your white charger and save the day? Stop the nightmares, the phantom limb pains? Restore what's lost?"" Her voice catches in her throat, and the tears start to flow.  ""Well, you CAN'T. Nobody can. Nobody will.""  EDIT: After thinking about it more, I have to make mention of the scene that I most associate with in the entire VN:  Rin: ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME!"""
katawashoujo,36ltos,shadowspark2,2,Wed May 20 22:08:14 2015 UTC,"This part and at the end where Emi completely opens up to Hisao afterwards were both really good scenes. Also when Hisao and Emi make up on the track. Personally I think Emi has the most memorable route overall because it's the most relatable.   Lilly's is too melodramatic (but she's tied for my fave character with Emi, and her route is really good)  Hanako's shyness and social anxiety is relatable to some, but for me personally she isn't.  Haven't played Rin's or Shizune's yet, but I can guess from what I know about the characters that Rin causes people to think introspectively and that leaves a deep impact as they are able to ""find themselves"" while Shizune's I have no clue."

katawashoujo,36ltos,shadowspark2,2,Thu May 21 00:00:36 2015 UTC,"Hah, it's the opposite for me. I like to think I've got a pretty good grasp of what people are like, but I could be wrong. I just pretend like I do and it seems to be working out. Emi's way of dealing with her problems is what I find so relatable. Hanako slowly comes out of her shell, but her shell is how she dealt with her trauma until she was ready to move on. Emi shuns her sorrow and fear while masking her pain, and continues with her day to day life as if nothing were wrong, which is exactly how I deal with most of my problems."
katawashoujo,36ltos,thatJainaGirl,2,Thu May 21 00:11:33 2015 UTC,"I see myself so strongly in Rin, that's why I loved her route so much. Between mental illnesses and a rough history, I'm several dozen different problems buried under a layer of impermeable lead. I've never been able to connect with anyone more than a passing interaction with a cashier.

katawashoujo,36imdh,Atario,2,Tue May 19 20:41:00 2015 UTC,I was going to mention the beta version (since that has different sprites from the pre-release) but I think you're right that we're looking at a VERY early alpha version. I know that the pre-alpha release you linked took the beta script and updated it with the final sprites but I'm not sure where to find that version of the game. If you find it let us know... I'm down to run Shizune's pre-pre-release. :-D

Just know that this is from like late 2007 or early 2008, is clearly of much lower quality than 4LS has proven themselves capable of, etc.  Looking at it again briefly, Shizune's section has music (really early music) and seems to lack backgrounds, so Shizune (or Shizu-chan) and Misha are seemingly standing in a void."

katawashoujo,369lfr,12thedata12,6,Sun May 17 14:53:18 2015 UTC,"The majority of the backgrounds used in KS were just standard images with a filter chucked over in Photoshop - the two I noticed that were most used were Angled Strokes and Accented Edges. Basically playing around with the settings in those two will get you something that replicates backgrounds in KS.  I also had a quick mess around, it also looks like cutout gives you similar results if you put the edge simplicity down and the number of levels up to the max. Example of somewhere familiar."

katawashoujo,369lfr,UnknownMango,2,Sun May 17 16:22:25 2015 UTC,Needs grain effects. You want original pictures but they can't be clear enough to be completely identifiable. It can cause issues so its better to just blur the photo so its only partially visible

Ideally, we should all be able to get along well enough so that there's no need to spend time with a bunch of people who agree on at least one thing. This subreddit alone likely means that we all enjoy KS to some degree, no need to further split it."

katawashoujo,366lda,EinsteinReplica,5,Sat May 16 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"There we have it. After a month and a week, starting with Hanako, and working through Rin, Shizune, Lilly and now Emi today, I have finished every girl's route in Katawa Shoujo. Truly one of the best games I have ever played. Usually I would post my route thoughts in a separate post, but I feel that I can post it in a comment here. So, in the same format as Hanako's and Lilly's thoughts posts, here is Emi's. Spoilers ahead.    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  SPOILERS AHEAD     Alright, onto Emi's route, and I knew I'd die if I went for it  So I went for it  Clicked ""Go for it"" at the track, and then heart fluttered   Before Emi's animation, when I selected ""Go for it"" as instructed by my route master. 13:28   ""So you're both stupid"" Gee, thanks Nurse   After the heart flutter. 13:30   ""wacky characters and nonsense plot"" That's so meta :D  CRIPPLE WONDERLAND?  HAHAHAHAHA   When Hisao is reading ""Alice: Adventures in Wonderland"" by Lewis Caroll. This was so fucking funny, seriously. 13:43.   This Hisao monologue is amazing... ""My God, Kenji""   Hisao jokes about Emi's conspiracy. This route was funny at so many points, and sad at many others. 13:58.   Hisao Puppy Hitter   Emi's eyes. 13:58.   ""As if I told a Catholic priest I sold my soul to the devil  ""You sold your soul to the devil""   Kenji, predictably mad as usual, when I say I am doing stuff with Emi for the festival. 14:04.   Would've been nice to have a choice of ""buy food"" or ""don't buy food""   Don't worry, past Konrad, you get a LOT more choices later on. At the festival with the fried food. 14:15   And there begins Act 2: Form   Form, Preparation and Motion, the three acts. Similar to Lilly's Past, Present and Future acts. 14:16.   ""Better than sex, right"". Wow.   Emi is a flirtatious track star on the track. 14:22.   And Hisao is ded.   Hisao has a heart flutter on the track again. 14:37.   Oh wow, I didn't expect ""Car crash"" to be Emi's cause of leglessness  I assume Emi's dad died in the car crash   The nurse tells Hisao that Emi was in a car accident, and Meiko said that Emi's dad is no longer around. I put 2 + 2 together, and it seemed obvious. 14:42 and 14:51, respectively.   They hug, and then Lullaby of Open Eyes plays xD   I can't remember which one this was, but it was a very upbeat song. 15:01   YOU ARE A PIRATE   YARR HARR FIDDLE DEE DEE, IF YOU LOVE TO SAIL THE SEA, YOU ARE A PIRATE. Emi's career plans. 15:06.   Wow, in each story, Hisao is VERY different about the letter  He replies to it in one route, asks Yuuko about it in another, and now he's angry at it   I believe it was in Rin's route that Hisao replied, in Hanako's route he discussed it with Yuuko, and now in Emi's route, he angrily discards it under the nightstand. 15:13.   Well, I think I did my first decision correct  Offered to run, she said no  Drop the issue   This route had a lot of difficult decisions in it. I mean, even the first one was hard, where you decide whether to enquire about her leg, or ignore it. I chose the first. Worked well. 15:24.   Best way to remove a boner is to shower   Every time he has a thought about Emi and relationships, he needs a shower. Classic man. 15:31.   Why is Concord playing?   It was playing at a weird time, but I can't remember when. Seemed very out of place. 15:33.   HISAO HAD A NAKED THOUGHT   Flash of pink on the screen outside Emi's room. Shower. 15:36.   Lol, my brother saw my PC screen when Emi is sat tired in her room   My brother entered my room a lot today, the first time he did so was when a bleary-eyed Emi was sat on the bed. Awkward. 15:37   Bam, smack, bif... wow xD   Emi is Spiderman confirmed. 15:39   Jealousy of the track captain, and wanting to help Emi with her dad issues. Adorable.   Hisao is pondering Emi, as per usual. 15:45.   ""What did her and Rin do in close quarters?""  ""STEADY ON OLD LAD""  Emi's route Hisao is BEST Hisao   Seriously, near the start, and near the end, Emi's route Hisao was the best Hisao out of all of them. Only time he faultered comes up later. 15:53   AND THERE IT IS! The kiss :D   They kiss. Duh. 15:58   Act 3. What a perfect way to begin Act 3.   Act 3: Preparation. Was almost exactly on the hour with this one. 15:59.   Oooh, Mutou has a book that I have. ""Brief History of Time"" by Stephen Hawking  ""Black holes""  ""It's not that dense""  THAT'S THE EPITOME OF BLACK HOLES   Yeah, from the name EinsteinReplica, you can probably guess I'm a science nerd. I have that book. Also, this is the second Science joke they've made in this game. I assume 4LS Studios' team was a group of nerds. 16:02.   Hmm.. press her or let it be?  I'll save  I pressed her... I think I did okay   When she is stumbling on her leg after the date. Trying to open up Emi. 16:12.   Emi doesn't like admitting she's in pain   Happens a lot in this route. 16:19.   And there it is, the word ""calumnies"" that earned me karma from Millbee's playthrough   I'll try to find the route, but over at /r/mindcrack a year or two ago, I posted a screenshot of the definition of ""calumnies"", since Millbee inquired what it meant and I saw karma possible. CBA to find the post right now. 16:23.   ""Should have had your heart attack earlier, Hisao""  I swear if he replies with ""You should have had your car crash later"" or something   On the roof, joking about Hisao's heart. 16:27   Okay, Emi's route Hisao is BEST Hisao  He's jokey, sarcastic, entertaining, and into science  He's like me :D   I also see them as the best qualities of a person (perhaps minus the science). Was thinking of this thanks to a recent post somebody made of ""Which Hisao is best Hisao?"". Emi's is. 16:30.   Okay, why the hell is there a Kenji-Yuuko-cryptography-theft storyline?  This feels VERY out of place  WAIT?  Kenji said that he disappeared from a girl he was dating a while ago, and Yuuko said that the guy she dated was much younger than him. Are they a romance?  Seems weird they'd hide that in Lilly's and Yuuko's routes   This was something probably discussed before, but I found it, probably since I did Lilly's and then Emi's routes. Also, meant to say ""Emi's route"", not ""Yuuko's route"" there. CONSPIRACY. 16:32.   Wheelchair sex?   Yep. 16:37   Wow, this is so weird xD  SHE HEADBUTTED HIM WHAT THE FUCK  Oh, right, I was correct  This IS wheelchair sex  WOW  WHAT THE HECK xD  OH MY GOD RIN  HAHAHAHAHA  I didn't expect THAT.   Sex scene number 1, full reaction. Headbutt, grinding, Rin. 16:39 to 16:44   ""We should probably ditch the clothes this time"" That damn VIXEN!   How long until next time, huh? 16:46   WHAT  WHAT  WHAT THE FUCK  WHAT THE FUCK  THAT ISN'T RACING GLOVES  THAT'S BREASTS  NO HISAO  NOT THE LUBRICANT  Oh right, the track captain is a homosexual  That makes sense  OMG  HAHAHAHAHA  EMI IBARAZAKI  FUCKING HILARIOUS  ""Anal""  I can't breathe xD  Omg  xD  HAHAHAHA  Wait... is Hisao gonna anal?  HOLY FUCK  THAT CHANGED FAST  WOW.  WOW.  WOW.  This is the most fucking weird sex scene I've seen in this game  Wow.  EMI'S FACIAL EXPRESSION  AHAHAHAHAHHA  AHAHA  Oh. My. God.  Wow.  This is the best sex scene.  OhmygodEmiI'msosorry  This is FUCKING hilarious  Okay, best scene in the game being Hanako's birthday is rivalled by Emi's sex scene   Sex scene 2. This was one of the best scenes I've seen in KS. So fucking funny. I cried laughing for about ten minutes at Emi's comments and face. 16:49 to 17:01   ""Need to stop hanging out so much""  Uhm  What  Too much fun? What?   My original confusion at Emi's comments. I thought she was breaking up with me, because of the anal. 17:06   Okay, I get it. Emi is adorable.  One of the best girls, I think.  Better than Lilly, maybe.   Still not sure. Hanako is DEFINITELY my favourite girl, but Lilly and Emi are tied for second place, with Shizune in 4th, and Rin in 5th. 17:07   YUUKO SHUT THE FUCK UP   Yuuko's ramblings in the library. 17:10   Okay, we're coming maybe to the sad bit  I assume Emi will reveal her dad died in a car crash  And that she gets nightmares  But for her to say it   I was still a way off from this happening, but I knew it was coming, didn't expect the long issue between Hisao and Emi before it, however. 17:12.   Mutou gave me relationship advice   Quarks - some of the relationship advice I can understand the best. 17:15   And now the beans are spilled   Kind of spilled. She mentioned her phantom leg pains and her nightmares, but not in detail. Early days. 17:21   Oh my, here's the depressing bit.  Emi trusted in her dad, and then her dad died, and now she trusts in nothing except herself   Not the most depressing, but close to it. Minor bean spillage. 17:23.   Damnit, Hisao  You're looking at it wrong you fucker  She slept well because it's off her chest, not because she's happy you know she won't closer  You fucking IDIOT, Hisao.   The part where I debated whether this Hisao was still best Hisao. He had venom in his feelings because Emi felt better. Damnit man, don't be like that. 17:26   HISAO YOU FUCKING IDIOT.  LISTEN TO YOURSELF YOU ILLOGICAL FUCKER  WHY WON'T YOU REALISE  HISAO  FUCKING  AHWAHHIASHRUGEWHUEWHUIEWRHUREWHUEWR  Wow Hisao, fuck you Hisao.  You shit bag.   Only the second time I've gotten full on angry at Katawa Shoujo, first time was when Rin was being annoying in her route. This time, it was at Hisao, not a girl. 17:28."

Why would I clam up about the problems, when my problem is Emi clamming up>   I've been saving before every decision in my playthroughs, but for this one, there was no need. It was open up or give up. 17:30.   Oh man, the Nurse is great too :P  Hanako, Emi, Akira and the Nurse   The four best characters. I think Emi is better than Lilly, by a hair. Hanako is amazing, Akira is witty and fun, and the Nurse is great too. 17:34   God, here was me liking this Hisao for being witty and sciency, and now I dislike him xD]   I disliked him for a bit, but he got better again at the end. Love you Hisao, fuck you Hisao, love you Hisao. 17:34.   Hisao stop being a fucking CUNT and realise that Emi trusts you  Listen to the FUCKING nurse   Still angry at this Hisao. He won't trust the nurse, the man who was with Emi through her rehab. 17:42.   Did he really forget that Meiko said her father wasn't around anymore?  Dumb Hisao   One issue I have with Katawa is that Hisao's memory is much worse than mine. I remembered Meiko mentioning Emi's father from the track meet, but Hisao didn't. 17:45.   Okay, Hisao, we're going to listen to Mutou's advice.  Observe it's effects, not it directly.  Talk to her mother   At Emi's house for dinner. Following Mutou's advice and gonna observe Emi's situation and follow it from it's effects, not the main cause. 17:45.   WOAH WHAT  Oh fuck  Is she gonna break up with me?   Don't push me away, after all we've been through! 17:49   Oh, that was a weird route into Act 4. At least I picked the right choices  Act 4: Motion   I know now that to get to Act 4 means you've done well. Happened to me on every route in the game (except my accidental leading into Hanako's medium route because I misread Lilly's phone call)   Wow, poor Hisao  I went from loving this Hisao, to hating him, to pitying him  Best Hisao is this routes   I went back to loving this Hisao. First time I've seen a Hisao give me full emotions for him. 18:02.   Here comes the breakup  Did I choose the wrong decisions?  Did I get the medium ending?   Okay, I said I knew that Act 4 meant you've won. But back then, I didn't. I thought Emi was gonna leave me, and that'd be it. 18:04.   OKAY THIS HISAO IS INCREDIBLE  FUCKING GREAT HISAO :D  He's learned :D   From good Hisao, to bitter Hisao, to pitiable Hisao, to good Hisao. Great Hisao in this route. Hisao Hisao Hisao. 18:06.   He's gotten through to Emi  OH MY GOD I DEFINITELY PICKED THE GOOD ROUTE   Emi finally gives in and admits to let Hisao closer. 18:07.   Oh man, this is great  This route has the best Hisao   I've said this too much. 18:08.   Hanako best character, Lilly best story, Emi best Hisao, Rin best depressing, Shizune best usage of multiple characters   As above. 18.09.   Visiting her dad's grave   The end draws near. 18:14.   wanna build Yamaku and loads of the other places from KS in Minecraft  Like, Emi's dad's gravestone would be a good small build  and Yamaku would be fun   I am probably gonna go through with this. I'm on a Survival Multi Player server with some friends, and intially I had ideas to start a large statue of Hanako, but this seems a much better idea. Would probably make the hospital, Yamaku, the little shopping district, the town, Shizune's house, the Hakkaido apartment, Emi's house, Emi's dad's tombstone, and some other places. Will be a LONG project, but worth it. 18:19   Anyway, Emi is loosening herself up  Telling small secrets she's hidden  Until she gets to her finale speech   Emi is finally gonna spill the beans. Good luck, Emi. 18:19.   This is very well done.   Don't know if I was commenting on Emi's way of revealing, or the story's writing. Probably both. 18:21.   Sex on her dad's anniversary  She really has changed   So much more open. 18:24.   That was adorable :D  And the first time she's said ""I love you""   That was really a defining point in Emi's route. She had only said ""I had a crush on you"" and ""Thanks, Hisao"" so far, and her saying those words after her past was defining. 18:26.   And that is it.  The end of Katawa Shoujo.  I finished it.  And a great end to a great game.   18:29.    So, that's Katawa Shoujo complete. Thanks for being here for my journey through the 5 main routes, and thanks for being a great community. I'm definitely gonna stick around here, especially since I a) love the fan art b) love the people here (/u/BlazePath, /u/FollowThePact, /u/noxnister, /u/TheDwarfLard etc. etc.) c) can now read every post without fear of spoilers and d) love Katawa Shoujo. Thanks everybody, it's amazing to be a part of this <3."

katawashoujo,366lda,Joby05,1 point,Sat May 16 23:45:36 2015 UTC,The only route to follow in beta. Shizu won me over because of that
katawashoujo,366lda,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sun May 17 02:55:07 2015 UTC,"I know, right? I tried Hanako's beta route and it literally got me to quit KS because it was so buggy and broken. I'm glad you enjoyed the beta and got a new perspective on Shizune, that's always my goal in recommendations. :-D"
katawashoujo,366lda,Joby05,1 point,Sun May 17 06:15:40 2015 UTC,"Considering what that whole thing is, it should expected that the routes will be buggy, unfinished, and in need of polish. Shizune's route may have just received a lot of attention from the people working on it.  Unrelated, but I seem to remember you saying you haven't read Hanako's official route. A preferable method of going about it is probably official then pre-release, looking at the pre-release as a what-if. Though, I could be wrong."
katawashoujo,366lda,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sun May 17 15:48:21 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I played Shizune's pre-release first and it set the expectations bar (probably unfairly). It comparison I just couldn't get through Hanako's. I will get back to it eventually, once I've completed Tsukihime.  You're probably right that pre-release Hanako wasn't the right place to start. I debated extensively which order I should play them. Since I was a pretty active community member and aware of the pre-release before starting, I figured it offered me a unique opportunity to be one of the few who experienced her story in that order. It isn't as crucial as in other VNs, but order is still important in KS. Shizune or Lilly first gives you a different perspective on the grudge. Lilly or Hanako first gives a different perspective on a bunch of act 1 and 2.   Don't worry, I've been missing KS and will get back to it soon. I know how strongly the Hanako fans feel about her route and I can't wait to experience it for myself. :-D"
katawashoujo,366lda,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sun May 17 16:01:32 2015 UTC,"From what I'm seeing now for Hanako's route, re-reading it after around a year and nine months, is that some of the tiny details are incredibly important. It also helps to think about how things progress and why certain actions facilitate changes. It's interesting writing everything down.  The whole route isn't perfect, of course, but it was incredibly touching and meaningful for some people."
katawashoujo,366lda,Sovietmustache,1 point,Sun May 17 16:14:18 2015 UTC,Indeed it would.
katawashoujo,366lda,Joby05,1 point,Sun May 17 16:37:31 2015 UTC,You fucking got me to play the beta and now I fucking depressed (I just got to act 4 so you probably know why)
katawashoujo,366lda,OhLookAtMeImSpecial,1 point,Sun May 17 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"As I say, the pre-release is intense! You get a far more loving and caring Shizune who is forced to go through a huge tragedy. You have to admit though, the pre-release story makes the final story look weak in comparison. In fact, it makes all of the final versions of all of the story look weaker in comparison.   You're experiencing one of the more emotional scenes in KS, in the midst of tragedy. Shizune has just revealed her biggest secret, the reason she feels like all of her relationships are built on lies. You and her are both experiencing a huge personal loss and trying to process how you feel. Then out of the blue you get  this, something you don't experience at all in the final path. A feels meteor has plummeted from space and wrecked you. It may be sad, but the story is good. It's REAL good. I truly hope you enjoyed it. :-D"
katawashoujo,366lda,Joby05,1 point,Sun May 17 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"The other routes in Beta are unpolished and raw but you really get to see another side of Shizune, which makes her character more likable and it really shows that she appreciates about Hisao. I can't exactly remember if she even ""says"" she loves you in the official route"
katawashoujo,367fcg,Xzcouter,2,Sat May 16 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"These are quite awesome. You plan on doing others, I assume?"

katawashoujo,366ygl,Hats_Hats_Hats,4,Sat May 16 19:31:19 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not sure if my opinion counts because for a very long time my Misha voice was very similar to ChilledChaos' (youtuber) Misha voice. But since someone showed me an artist who goes by Lights I've used her singing voice as a basis for Misha's voice ever since.  For an example, this is a song that gives me strong Misha vibes, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Ohl3MMq0o Quiet by Lights."

katawashoujo,366ygl,Schnutzel,1 point,Sun May 17 09:47:25 2015 UTC,"There was an attempt to voiceover KS on youtube a while back. They never finished, and I'm not sure if they ever did any of Misha's scenes, but you could try checking that out."
katawashoujo,366ygl,AuntJemimah7,2,Sun May 17 07:07:50 2015 UTC,Are you saying you think Misha sounds autistic?
katawashoujo,366ygl,FollowThePact,7,Sat May 16 22:40:47 2015 UTC,"Shizune's Alpha isn't canon what so ever. What is canon though is that Yamaku Academy allows people who don't have disabilities go to to the school, but doesn't allow mental disabilities, and that Misha is there to be a translator for the deaf.  If Misha did indeed have autism Jigoro would have called her out on that shit so many times, cause Jigoro is a douchebag.  Also depending if you take the joke as actual canon or not, the devs did say the 'canon' reason for Misha going there is because she broke a fingernail and her parents overreacted and sent her to the Academy. They said that so that people would stop asking, ""whats Misha's disability?"" Which leads me to believe that she indeed doesn't have one and that people should stop saying she does.  Misha is just a clutz who's going through major swings of depression."
katawashoujo,366ygl,FollowThePact,4,Sat May 16 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"Hisao was a major case of depression. Hanako was a major case of depression. Rin was a major case of depression. Emi was a major case of depression.  Literally I wouldn't expect anything less than 90% of the students at Yamaku Academy have depression issues.  So that means in 4LS's Yamaku Academy depression isn't counted as a mental disability.  If Misha had a inner ear issue, then it would have been brought up in the story. Simply put none of these theories are canon, rather head-canon. When the devs are getting tired of getting asked, ""What is Misha's disability"" they create a joke disability of her fingernail braking to let her inside Yamaku, then I don't know, maybe she just doesn't have a disability at all.  There's theories that Mutou is Dr Who. There are  theories that Nurse is romantically involved with Meiko/The Track Captain. What do these theories share? They're not canon.  Also don't hate on what I believe Misha's voice sounds like. That's just rude man. I'm just questioning the fact you think she's autistic, because there's no canon reason to believe she's autistic.  Also, Lights=Electopop, not indie folk."
katawashoujo,366ygl,FollowThePact,1 point,Sat May 16 23:02:07 2015 UTC,"Seems like your frustrations have carried over into this comment as well.  I'm just pointing out that canonically Misha has no disabilities. Misha wouldn't be the one to hide her disabilities to people. Jigoro would have called Misha out for having a disability. Misha's text doesn't read like how a autistic person would speak. Misha has a deeper understanding of emotions and boundaries than 95% of the autistic population.  I don't know what you want from a discussion with me. Do you want me to agree with all of your points? Because that's not a discussion either.  Back when only the first act was released it was highly theorized that Misha had cancer and would die at the end of Shizune's route. Misha didn't have cancer and didn't die at the end of Shizune's route in the full release.  So yes, I don't believe Misha is autistic. My stated points of canon back me up just as much if not more so than your theorized points."

I'm not all the way through but I'm most of the way there and the story has been absolutely amazing and the art style is pretty unique. Rating it EPIC/10."

Shichika and Togame begin their odyssey by leaving the island he called home for over 20 years. They will face twelve individuals who possess and protect Shikizaki's legendary swords.

The manga began serialization in the seinen magazine Young Gangan published by Square Enix in December 2004. An anime adaptation produced by Seven Arcs and directed by Keizō Kusakawa aired in Japan between July and September 2008, and a second season aired between July and September 2010. Both seasons are licensed in North America by Funimation. The central character of the series is Minato Sahashi, a ronin who failed college examinations twice. His life changes, however, when he meets a girl named Musubi.

Personally, I found obvious connections with each of the ladies however the two strongest in many ways were Rin and Lilly. For most of my life I was Lilly on the outside and Rin on the inside. These years now though I just don't care to put the effort as much into forcing the Lilly. She's still there for me, I just do not force it as the only face so often.  Another bit of it were the stories themselves. Lilly's was so very heartwarming, loving, slow and subtle, yet obviously (eventually) 'feels right'. Rin's feels more real in the opposite direction. Things are not always as they seem. Relationships are not perfect nor how we deal with issues that might arise. Through both those scopes though there are people who make realizations, concessions, confessions, and growths.  Hope that helps some but that previous paragraph feels off in some way.

Lilly has an incredibly caring and lovely personality, she is disarming in a way that you instantly feel safe around her. In the end, what I took from her route's sentiment was that having some one to share your inner turmoil with is incredibly valuable. Therefore you should not settle for loneliness, but find some one you can feel safe around.  Rin challanged me in a much different way, to me she was a catalyst of inner turmoil. Rather than the soothing thought of sharing and then getting to terms with your situation she challenged me to question things head-on. I also connected on a lot of levels when it came to understanding people and being understood by them.  Together they form a dynamic duo of self-reflection. And let's not forget they are also damn cute! :)"
katawashoujo,3602g2,Cycl4mate,3,Fri May 15 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"There's a few people who are fans of both Rin and Lilly, but I don't believe there's that many, likely for reasons you already stated. For those that do, might because Rin has certain aspects about her that they like or they enjoyed her route and the same for Lilly."
katawashoujo,3602g2,TheDwarfLard,2,Thu May 14 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"Rin is my favorite character, mostly because I actually understood what she was saying. On the other hand, I'd say Lilly's my least favorite (girl) character, simply because she's the least developed among the main girls, at least in my opinion. My second favorite character is Akira, just because I love the way she can be outgoing but not intimidating. Rin and Akira don't have much, if anything, in common, but there are things I like about them both.  For those who like Lilly and Rin, it's probably because people like characters for different reasons, like maybe they relate to Rin but they like Lilly's motherly, caring, personality. In real life, when you choose your friends, I'm sure they aren't all the same and maybe some are complete opposites of each other. But you like them all for different reasons.  Also, I'm not entirely sure why characters who only appear in the first class CG are people's favorite characters. Is it because they have pseudo-routes people like, or because they looked cute in the class CG? Or maybe both?"
katawashoujo,3602g2,Youbiseiharukana,2,Fri May 15 03:05:17 2015 UTC,"Appearance likely plays a part, but maybe the fact that people can do nearly whatever they want with them is appealing (and in some cases, people have done that). Suzu's pseudo-route had to start somewhere."
katawashoujo,3602g2,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Fri May 15 03:20:50 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. As a very imaginative person, I can understand the appeal behind taking an image and making a full character out of them. Although I'm more likely to create full characters on my own. So when someone says their favorite character is, say, Molly, would their Molly be a vastly different character from someone else's Molly? (I'm not aware of who has pseudo-routes and who doesn't)"
katawashoujo,3602g2,Youbiseiharukana,1 point,Fri May 15 04:45:00 2015 UTC,"Two different Molly pseudo-routes would almost definitely have two different Mollys. I believe Suzu, Akira, Natsume (WIP maybe?), and Aoi (WIP) have pseudo-routes, along with multiple WIP Miki ones."
katawashoujo,3602g2,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Fri May 15 05:09:28 2015 UTC,"Aoi's also a girl, right (sorry, I've only heard it on a boy before)? None of the boys have any routes, I suppose? There are other male students in the class CG, right?"
katawashoujo,3602g2,Youbiseiharukana,1 point,Fri May 15 05:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's some males, but I don't believe any of them have piqued the interest of those willing to write (or attempt to write) a pseudo-route. Hisao is straight, so it wouldn't really work very well in that setting. A 'bro' route could work, but I doubt many are willing to do that."
katawashoujo,3602g2,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Fri May 15 05:46:50 2015 UTC,"Heh, in my opinion Hisao is as straight as you want him to be. But maybe that's just me. Although technically it's totally possible for him to have been bi/pan and just never realized it, which would probably lead to some interesting introspection."
katawashoujo,3602g2,Youbiseiharukana,2,Fri May 15 06:16:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are a lot.  It just came up recently in a post, so there's been a little discussion about it."
katawashoujo,3602g2,Atario,2,Fri May 15 06:18:08 2015 UTC,"Rin and Lilly are my bestgirls. They are absolutely tied, and I don't think I'll ever decide on one; and i'm perfectly happy with that!  I think the biggest misstep is that they're being compared side-by-side, rather than on their own scales. Their relation to each other is irrelevant; I can like two completely different people and not need to compare them to know I like them both; they stand on their own merits.  I like Rin because she's artistic and dream-like. Her sincere cluelessness is adorable, and her paragraphs of semi-emotional outbreaks? Downright cute. Her distance from the world around her resonates with me deeply as well.  But I also like Lilly because she's mature, calm, elegant and relaxed. I don't really care about the social aspect, and I don't think the detail amounts to much other than that she is a very likeable person. She is also a genuinely caring girl, who is very in touch with others emotions.  So, I don't think the question is really ""odd match-up or combination."" It's more about strength of characterization in the novel and resonance with your own desires. And in that aspect, Rin and Lilly are equal for me."
katawashoujo,3602g2,bubeez,2,Fri May 15 09:45:05 2015 UTC,"For me, the reason is that I adore their kinds of stories, and as such I like their routes (and their characters) very much. I should probably explain that in greater depth.  Lilly's route is a pretty standard romance. It hits all the normal romance notes and it even has an anguished ""chase after the love interest before she gets on the plane"" scene. Nothing in her route is ""out there"" or unusual - and that's okay, because romance cliches are cliche because they're good. I'm a sucker for a well constructed romance and Lilly's route is exactly that.  Rin's route, on the other hand, is a dark arthouse movie. It's full of introspection and people falling to pieces and psychological strain. I am a huge fan of dark artsy media - Paranoia Agent and Serial Experiments Lain are my favourite anime, to give a pair of examples of the genre - and Rin's route pulls this off in spades."
katawashoujo,3602g2,SirKaid,1 point,Sun May 17 00:43:26 2015 UTC,"I don't get it either. My best girls are Suzu and Rin.  People are complex, I guess? I fell hard for Rin's route because of how socially awkward I am (among many other reasons). I can see how someone who is more neutral on the scale of awkward/experienced, introvert/extrovert might end up connecting with both Rin and Lilly."

katawashoujo,3602g2,Kafke,1 point,Sat May 16 03:12:58 2015 UTC,"Personally, I adored Rin but hated Lilly, but a lot of that is because I prefer the routes that are about falling in love, rather than being in love."

katawashoujo,35zfcc,RussianAttackTricycl,2,Thu May 14 20:34:26 2015 UTC,"Anytime someone mentions their need for an anime of KS, I basically put out this idea as well. I don't care for an anime of what I've read or even past the endings. I would much rather have a prequel of the girls stories before Hisao came tumbling around.  Watching Lilly and Shizune slowly start to dislike the other, and get to see just what broke up the student council. Watch as Misha falls for Shizune just to have her advances crushed to the point where she makes a new identity for herself (drilled pink-haired Misha). Start off with Emi and Rin meeting eachother when moving in, and see Emi fall for her track captain. Also personally I want to see Hanako before she meets Lilly. Then on the finale episode we watch Hisao stroll into his homeroom.  The way the characters are this VN could easily lend itself to be an enjoyable anime. :/"

katawashoujo,35zfcc,FollowThePact,1 point,Sat May 16 19:32:13 2015 UTC,very true. i'll think about that. it would be difficult because i would have to go through ks again just to get little snipits of info about his previous life. but yeah you're right much more freedom. i literally read this and instantly had the funniest image in my head of iwanako talking to some guy and there being a thought bubble over hisaos head of him running around crying as a chibi x'D  Off topic a little but it was funny xD
katawashoujo,35zfcc,Cycl4mate,1 point,Thu May 14 21:10:06 2015 UTC,"Chiming in on what BlazePath said, Hisao is a fairly bland character in KS for various reasons. (player immersion being a major culprit)  Being a clean slate in KS does not mean he is a clean slate to be written in a prequel, although there is always space for artistic freedom, especially since the hospital left him mentally numbed and almost depressed. His life was probably slightly more colourful before it but still very ordinary.  If I were you I'd mainly look for the opportunity of adding strong characters in his surroundings, his friends, teachers and Iwanako of course."

If it's too difficult to choose, perhaps just flip a coin or something, setting which side goes to which route beforehand.  As for me, Hanako's route was incredibly meaningful. It certainly wasn't perfected and could have been improved in areas, but it was sweet, sad, and quite powerful. While it's easier to do on a second reading, looking at the character's actions and the thoughts behind them has proved to be an interesting experience for me thus far.  Either way, you will likely run into the Hanako/Lilly wall, where you may be somewhat uncomfortable doing the other route after whichever you choose first.   Edit: Grammar."
katawashoujo,35x5h1,TheDwarfLard,2,Thu May 14 06:44:21 2015 UTC,"Hanako's is my personal favourite. ( so far)  I just love the writing in the route. The character development seems very real and natural. I can't go into it too much for spoilers.  Go for whoever. Problem is, because they are a pair, and they're stories interact a lot, you may not want to play one right after the other. In fact, I recommend a break between the two."

I don't think either of us knew what to expect after Akira told us that both she and Lilly had plans to leave Japan for Scotland… permanently. Hanako and I were definitely happy together, but that would have brought both of us down considerably. Losing a mutual friend isn't easy. Yet, shortly after we heard the news, I heard from Lilly herself that she was going to stay in Japan. Never learned much concerning the details, though.  Apparently Lilly really wanted to thank Hanako by giving her and myself a pleasant night together. She never really said what was planned for tonight, just that we had to go to a specific address in Sendai.  Coming up on the sizable and traditional looking building, it's clear that Lilly decided to go all out for us. She reserved us a spot in an onsen pool, though I'm still unsure on the specifics, as is Hanako.  ""I wasn't really expecting Lilly to do all this for us… Well, shall we head in?""   An excited 'okay' follows.  I give our names and reserved time that Lilly told me to write down to the receptionist and her face instantly lights up.   ""Ah, you must be the two that a Miss Satou made reservations for?""   Hanako speaks up before I'm able to, ""Yes, that's us.""   ""Well, I hope you two enjoy your night here. Don't hesitate to ask for anything you may require.""   We both nod in response.   After learning which pool is reserved for us, Hanako cheerfully goes on ahead to get ready while I stick around to ask more questions.  I learn that one of the reasons Lilly decided to rent a place for us here instead of anywhere else, well save it being close to Yamaku, was that there's the option for mixed bathing. Not only that, but nude mixed bathing. Just the thought of that sends my heart racing. Additionally, there's a view of the night sky, privatized by a bamboo fence. And at least today is Saturday, meaning we don't have anything to do tomorrow.   Before I can head off to our room, the receptionist tells me one more thing, ""Miss Satou told me one other thing, but only to reveal it after your time is up here.""   I nod, but remain incredibly curious what that could be.  As is required, I wash myself thoroughly before entering the pool itself. After doing so, I can see that Hanako is already done washing herself and inside the pool with her eyes closed. Should try my best to not disturb her. I lower myself into the water as carefully as possible and seem to do a pretty good job at that… at least I thought so. She must have felt the rippling water. Her eyes are open wide and her mouth is slightly agape, but the expression instantly fades into a warm smile after seeing that it's me. It's slightly difficult to see her past the steam, but she's certainly quite exposed. Even with that, she doesn't seem to mind at all.  Hanako slowly moves her way from the other side of the pool over to where I am. Upon getting there, she rests her head on my shoulder, places her scarred hand over my own scar, and looks up at me. Both of us want to say the same thing, but a small pause takes place before that, where we both take everything in, together.   ""I love you, Hana.""   ""I l-love you too, Hisao.""   Hanako rights her head and gives me a passionate kiss, without disturbing the water much, if at all. A blush, full-force, is definitely on my face right now. After Hanako rests her head on my shoulder again, I place my arms around her, closely pulling us together.  She whispers to me, ""How much longer do we have?""   A whisper of my own in response, ""A few hours, let's make the most of it.""   When our time is up and the receptionist lets us know electronically, Hanako looks disappointed and I can't blame her. While there were some things we couldn't do in the pool to maintain cleanliness, Hanako and I decided to show our love for each other in just about every way imaginable. We both put our clothes back on and I eagerly await what the second part of Lilly's gift is. Considering it's nearly 1:00 on Sunday, there's not a whole lot we can do.  ""What Miss Satou wanted me to tell you two after your time here was that she also rented a room in the hotel across the street so you could spend the night together. I sincerely hope you enjoy.""   'Thank you' escapes our lips in unison, accompanied by a bow.  We head across the street and enter the extravagant hotel, check in, and head off to our room. Hanako nearly instantly plops herself onto the plush bed and softly calls me over. I join her and we drift off into slumber together in each other's arms."

Is air coming in and out of the retractable part, and if so are the buttons that you press on the left and right covering the entrance holes or shutting them completely?  Also how'd you get interested in the accordion?  Hell of a video though, would love to hear some more!"

katawashoujo,35vwpb,Darkon-Kriv,5,Wed May 13 23:17:24 2015 UTC,"I'm female. I heard about the game from my roommate, also female. Initial reaction was curiosity since she raved about it and had Misha as a background on her computer. I fell in love instantly when I started playing because the story was really great and the characters seemed so real. I have shared it with a few other people, mostly close friends who like reading.   Is there anything else you wanted to ask? :)"
katawashoujo,35vwpb,CelestialRose,2,Wed May 13 23:35:50 2015 UTC,I don't know if you know anything about me. I don't expect you to but I have a girl friend and I want to share it with her but i she has a hard time dealing with sad stuff. Thoughts?
katawashoujo,35vwpb,CelestialRose,2,Wed May 13 23:39:12 2015 UTC,"I think that depends on what you mean by a hard time. Certain parts of the story that really struck home with me because I have the same or similar problems were a little tough to read, but I was happy I read them. I think it helped me deal with things a little better. I would say to share it with her and just be supportive of her. Sit with her while she's playing, let her walk away from it with no pressure, etc."
katawashoujo,35vwpb,CelestialRose,2,Wed May 13 23:51:28 2015 UTC,That's the thing it's a long distance relationship

It hasn't been too long and Katawa Shoujo can be something extremely personal, especially since you said she doesn't handle sad well. You can talk about a little bit and stuff like that, but I wouldn't get her into playing it so quickly because you don't know how she'll handle it.   Hope that helps."

Never played a visual novel before, but I fell in love with it and played through all the routes.  Though at first I thought it was kind of boring to read and have a picture there with no voice acting or anything."

katawashoujo,35vwpb,Youbiseiharukana,1 point,Thu May 14 16:27:20 2015 UTC,"Sort of the same thing for me, but I had heard of it before. I  just didn't look into playing it becasue to some extent I somewhat fell victim to some cliched assumptions that people have of VNs. I decided to play it since it was free and I wanted to see what they would have to say. Their conversation left quite a bit to be left desired, but the game certainly didn't. Emi's route was great and it was definetly the hardest I've ever cried at a work of fiction."
katawashoujo,35vwpb,Youbiseiharukana,4,Thu May 14 17:00:32 2015 UTC,I'm female. I found out about KS through an ex-boyfriend. I'm pretty open minded and also like VNs so I didn't have a bad initial reaction. My current boyfriend played through two routes as well and we've talked about it a bit. I introduced it to my very dear guy friend and we talk about it sometimes too. Anything else you wanted to know?
katawashoujo,35vwpb,Youbiseiharukana,2,Wed May 13 23:57:25 2015 UTC,I want to tell my GF thoughts? She has a hard time with sad stuff
katawashoujo,35vwpb,ApplicableSongLyric,2,Thu May 14 00:00:52 2015 UTC,I'd say it depends on her personality/interests. I also have a hard time with sad stuff (i. e. super emotional) but I really enjoyed KS. Maybe let her know it's super feelsy and let her decide for herself if she wants to play?
katawashoujo,35vwpb,Emi_Ibarazakii,2,Thu May 14 00:03:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for your thoughts. I am sad to say that its a long distance relationship so I cant just hug it out if she gets sad.

Either way, it kind of all happened at once. They were the first chiptune artist I got into though, and their live shows are a blast. Seriously, one of the best concerts I've ever been to.

katawashoujo,35u209,Joby05,2,Tue May 19 01:54:24 2015 UTC,Maybe a lot of people initially lean towards the Emi-Rin and Lilly-Hanako groups.
katawashoujo,35u209,TheDwarfLard,2,Tue May 19 01:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like Shizune's route is a bit difficult to get onto only because I really disagree with some of the early choices you have to make. I really like the route as a whole, and I actually found myself enjoying it more than some of the other routes, but her Act I scenes are rough for my personality to even consider.   Not to be /u/Joby05 (love you man!) but I find the way she is portrayed in the pre-release version far more relatable and easier to identify with than the final."
katawashoujo,35u209,Joby05,2,Tue May 19 02:30:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Act 1 doesn't give a good enough impression of her, compared to the other girls."
katawashoujo,35u209,Joby05,2,Tue May 19 02:45:01 2015 UTC,"While it can be the case, relatability shouldn't necessarily be an author's top priority. It can happen, but sometimes certain characters think very different from ourselves, which does provide for another perspective."
katawashoujo,35u209,Joby05,1 point,Tue May 19 03:03:20 2015 UTC,"Not sure I agree. One thing the pre-release does that I love is make Shizune extremely relatable. I think that there is a difference between agreeing with someone and being able to relate for them. For example, you might see someone who kills someone else as an evil monster. Then with some back story you can learn that they were seeking vengeance for a heinous crime commuted against them or a loved one. Though I may not agree with them, getting the background information makes them far more relatable.  In the pre-release you get a lot more info about her past, what drives her competitive side and why she had such a hard time relating to the other people in the school since she was deaf but could read lips she knew about all tof the nasty things the other kids said about her when they thought she couldn't hear. It really fleshes out her human side and makes you far more empathetic (at least for me it did)."
katawashoujo,35u209,HappyCatFish,1 point,Tue May 19 04:40:28 2015 UTC,"Even then, it's incredibly subjective. If someone were to read Rin's route and never really experienced the problems she went through (as some people have), that doesn't make the story or characters any worse. Trying to make characters/stories relatable can get in the way of creating something compelling. It's likely that someone will relate, since that's nearly impossible to avoid.  As for that example, I can see multiple problems with it that make the situation unrelatable for me. Yes, I've been the subject/target of a fairly severe crime in the past, but that didn't make me want to kill the person/people who carried it out. If anything, that can lead to a path where they can't stop themselves from doing it again, even if the situation is less severe. I do indeed disagree with them there, but what leads to such hatred and wickedness is not something I've experienced before and I hope no one else needs to.  Similarly, I can't relate to competitive people much, if at all, due to my own thoughts on what that often leads to, but it doesn't prevent me from writing a character who's quite competitive. Being able to do so even somewhat effectively shows that notable characters and stories don't have to be relatable for the writer him/herself to have value. Others being able to do that for characters/stories they can't relate to shows that despite their own experiences and opinions, they're willing to temporarily cast it aside for the sake of seeing what's in store.  Someone I looked up to as a writer was borderline disgusted when the word 'relatability' came up. He was telling the story the way it was and the characters the way they simply were, not so others can relate to either to make everything easier on them. If they can't cast aside their own experiences for the sake of the story or even look at the story from a distanced view, it's their lose. Even if I can't really relate to Shizune, Lilly, Rin, or Emi as much as I do with Hanako, that doesn't make them bad characters or have bad stories in any way. Perhaps they did some things wrong, but they also did things right. Those stories just might not be for me, but I still find them all to be respectable, despite my experiences and opinions."
katawashoujo,35u209,Joby05,1 point,Tue May 19 05:30:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think it has to be. For example... you telling me that the way Shizune is with Hisao is the closest to a ""typical"" traditional Japanese relationship helped me relate to her far more. If that had been mentioned in the story itself, maybe a line saying ""Well Hisao, you know Shizune was raised to be very traditional"" I wouldn't have needed as much cultural knowledge to ""get her""."
katawashoujo,35u35z,jackzypher,5,Wed May 13 14:54:13 2015 UTC,"Rin seems to be a very polarizing route - either you love it or you hate it.  Her route isn't anything like the other girls, and unlike the other girls there's not even the slightest bit of information from Act 1 to use as a baseline for ""her route is generally going to go like this"".  With Hanako you can tell her route will focus on her scarring and social issues as you try to get her to open up.  For Emi, you can tell it will involve a lot of running, and that there's no way she can be that happy and bouncy all the time.  But for Rin...it isn't about her arms.  She made it pretty clear in Act 1 that she doesn't really care about it.  It is more about exploring her character.  She does have issues, and they get in the way a lot.  The romance takes a bit of a back seat in this story as you watch Rin battle with her problems and Hisao (usually unsuccessfully) try to help her.  If you can't decide, then just give it a try.  Like I said, Rin's route is already polarizing and leaves some people loving it (like me) and some people hating it.  haha"
katawashoujo,35u35z,albro1,1 point,Wed May 13 14:59:19 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, Rin's route was my favorite, but Rin is my least favorite of all the girls."
katawashoujo,35u35z,LRats,2,Wed May 13 16:44:16 2015 UTC,"Don't do it if you don't really want to   Rin's an interesting character if you try to understand her, and I doubt you'll really try if you dislike her (I wouldn't)."
katawashoujo,35u35z,ChihuahuaGod,2,Fri May 15 01:48:59 2015 UTC,"I would suggest still giving it a try, but maybe that's just me. I'm not a completionist but I do like to finish at least every route's good end. Otherwise I feel as though I may have missed out on something I might have enjoyed.   That being said, Rin was probably the only character I genuinely liked in the game, and wanted to play her route as soon as I could. I not only understood her and what she was saying, it made me annoyed with Hisao for not understanding her himself. Possibly not everyone will understand her, but I thought I might mention just to say that it isn't impossible either. It isn't as though I understood her 100% of the time either, but that's what made it interesting for me. She was a complex person, and humans are naturally complex creatures.  This is strictly my opinion and experience. I hope you do give Rin a chance and maybe your opinion of her might change. Maybe you still won't like her. That's okay. I didn't like every one of them myself, but I don't regret giving them all a chance."

And I meant that, I expect to hear from you again in roughly 2.5 weeks on your progress.  One thing I will say though, slowly stop running for Emi and start running for your own goals. Emi wouldn't want to have a partner who's just out there to go out there and only run with her (in mind), and would rather have someone out there on the track when she's not there herself."
katawashoujo,35rdj3,FollowThePact,5,Wed May 13 01:40:19 2015 UTC,"Nicely done. And tl;dr's like that one are always a nice touch.  Also, not really sure what the average running speed is or anything, but you did around 10.5mph or 4.8m/s, which sounds quite swift."

That's over 6 miles - a distance one needs to really pace themselves carefully with.  1000m is 0.62 miles, so it is natural that he would go at a much faster speed than you.  It is a short distance so he doesn't need to pace himself, he just needs to sprint it."

katawashoujo,35s9xh,albro1,1 point,Wed May 13 02:17:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm...constructive criticism.  I'd say you definitely need to practice your proportions.  Emi's head is much larger than any other part of her body, and her waist is almost as thin as her arms.  Her chin melds into her neck which contrasts how skinny you made her.  Her arms are also drawn in an unnatural way.  I don't think I need to mention the hands - they are tough for a lot of people.  You just have to practice.  As for Rin, her feet seem extremely small, as well as her shoulders.  Her ear is also a bit too high up on her head.  There isn't much else to say.  Just remember that two of the most important places to communicate a character's personality is in their eyes/eyebrows, and their hands and how you position them (Obviously the second doesn't apply to Rin, which means you really need to focus on using her eyes and eyebrows to communicate her personality)."

katawashoujo,35rxic,Viaox,1 point,Wed May 13 00:41:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a tough one. Shizune has a certain charm to her, but she isn't for everyone. I actually find going from Shizune to Lilly or Lilly to Shizune can cause a bit of mixed feelings as they have a rivalry and it's likely you'll side with we whichever you've seen first. I haven't don't Rin or Hanako yet, but I thought Shizune's final route wasn't too bad.  Maybe consider taking a KS break or trying a different VN and coming back?"

I mean, I'm seriously bad at drawing. The opposite of a picaso.  2) I don't want to be mid-way through drawing a sketch on my whiteboard (my choice if I'm ever going to draw anything, cause its easy to erase) and have my parents walk in on that.

From what could be understood of Hanako's comments indicate that there was, in fact, enough to drink.  Shizune and Hisao invented a new party game and proceeded to tie with each other throughout the evening.  Rin, after imbibing, began to make nonsensical yet grammatically correct comments in German.  No one we spoke with can confirm nor deny whether she knows German.  We are currently consulting Mutou and Nurse to get an explanation from physics or biology as to how someones hair can maintain a drill shape through such excited and joyous dancing, but we suspect Misha enjoyed herself.

I've ruined many, many drawings trying to add some more depth. I really don't want to ruin this one, so i'll ask before I jump in. What the hell do I do next?"
katawashoujo,35mukg,flameleaf,3,Mon May 11 20:25:33 2015 UTC,"If you're serious about getting good, head over to /r/ArtFundamentals - The lessons there will take you through the basics and give you a solid foundation to build your artistic ability.  Also there are two books by Scott Robertson called ""How to Draw"" and ""How to Render"" - I recommend both highly.  I've also done a few critiques for other artists on this sub which address some of the issues you have - you can take a look here and here!  Good luck!"
katawashoujo,35mukg,fermatiaudapy,2,Tue May 12 22:23:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I'll give that subreddit a try before tackling those books.   I really do want to make that next step. I'm not happy with creating a nice drawing 1 out of 5 times anymore.
katawashoujo,35mukg,fermatiaudapy,2,Wed May 13 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"Sounds like my dilemma with poetry. I can one-shot some good poetry onto a piece of paper but there's always a feeling of ""it could be better."" With poetry, I can type it and copy/paste then edit a copy in case I screw up. Drawing is a little harder to do that with but there are tools out there. If you're at least moderately ok with computers, find a good drawing tablet so you can save and ""save as"""
katawashoujo,35mukg,fermatiaudapy,2,Tue May 12 11:19:24 2015 UTC,"This looks really good! :D There's a few things you can do to improve as a whole though!  1) Use less lines. Each ""v"" of hair can be done in as little as two lines, and you should try and keep it that way. I looks a lot better/cleaner when you do it like that.  2) Add more details! I know you said you ""ruin"" drawings by adding depth, but how many drawings do you think big artists have ""ruined"" on their way to becoming what they are today? Quite a lot.  3) DRAW EVERY DAY. This can't be stressed enough. I've just recently gotten into the habit of doing it consistently myself.  Regardless of any of this, your stuff is really good right now, but there's always room for improvement. :D"

Who paid for the initial setup with Iwanako?  Why? A wind machine that's convincing outdoors from a distance, but is not audible? Guessing it's supposed to be Lilly's dad buying the breakup attempt.  But it's not at all clear why these staging-people need to be involved at the airport, nor how an airport allows a random drone to hang around inside it. Akira seems super hostile, for no apparent reason.  And our protagonist seems really talkative in the airport. This guy being instrumental in sending Lilly back to Hisao undercuts the hints in the canon about her picking up on it via her extra-fine hearing.   Other than all that, you're right in that he has quite a way of packing meaning in and turning a phrase.  Comes across a little hardboiled-noir-ish because of it, but that seems to be the aim."

katawashoujo,35fapb,EinsteinReplica,3,Sat May 9 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"One of the main issues people (including myself) have with Lilly's route is how utterly cliche it is.  It had twists and turns and was a good story, but when you have experience with reading stories and storytelling in general, it feels very...generic.  But the generic stories usually grip people who are newer to storytelling methods the hardest.  Not that that's a bad thing.  I definitely enjoyed Lilly's route during my play-through, but in retrospect I really liked the storytelling in other routes (especially Rin's :P)."
katawashoujo,35fapb,albro1,2,Sun May 10 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"I think the genius bit of KS, random or not, is that the range of paths caters to everyone — the Japan-fans (I won't use the 'w' word in polite company), the amateurs and newbies, the professionals and old hands, the complicated and the straightforward. Each path is very different. Not everyone will like all the paths; probably there'll be at least one you'll dislike or like a lot less.  It's a valuable lesson for anyone else interested in story-telling or VN-crafting: must cater to a broader audience, and do each kind of thing well. :)"
katawashoujo,35fapb,brythain,2,Sun May 10 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"Lilly's did feel kind of generic with the fairytale ending into the sunset, but tbh, for the emotions I had during it, it was still incredible. I started with it normally, thought it was cool, then it got kind of sad at points, then Hisao's heart flutters worried me as I kept thinking he'd die, then Lilly's deeper sadness, and then the almost heart attack, and then more sadness, and then some happiness and content nature, then Lilly will be moving to Scotland, then sadness, then sadness, then almost death, then sadness, then sadness, and then happiness. It was incredibly well done.  It had generic aspects, but for every route I've played (I got the good route on every one so far), they have all had the cliche ending of ""it's all happy now"". It was the way they handled the story telling that really gripped me.  It's not about the destination, it's about the journey - /u/kurtjmac"

Try studying some anatomy, and look at the relationships between different body parts.  For example, pay attention to where people's arms end in relation to their body (Midway down the thigh).  Look at the relationships between the hips and shoulders (In men, shoulders are wider or just as wide as the hips.  In women, the shoulders are narrow and hips are wider).  Just little things that you can use as ""general rules"" when constructing a body.  And remember that every part of the body can be made with shapes!  Use building blocks and expand on them and add detail. :)"

katawashoujo,35e9wz,Atario,3,Sat May 9 20:16:27 2015 UTC,"Not that I read them aloud, but my mental voices for each character go something like this:    Character How the voice sounds in my head (all shows referenced being the English dubs where applicable)    Hisao My own voice.  Boring, but there it is.   Emi Pretty close to the Let's Dub KS voice.   Rin Similar to the Let's Dub KS voice, but flatter and less expressive and a bit lower-pitched.  Deadpan.   Misha Big and brassy.  Kind of like Chizuru from Bleach, but a little cutesier.   Shizune When she signs and Hisao can understand it, I hear a heavy-reverb, faster-speaking version of Kikyo from Inuyasha.   Lilly Almost exactly the Let's Dub KS voice.  That, but with just a hint of a posh English accent.   Hanako Breathy and soft.  Ururu from Bleach, but with a stutter.   Nurse Gin from Bleach.  Probably mostly due to the resemblance, I guess.   Kenji Steve from American Dad!, but angrier.   Mutou Harrison Ford.  Not as a particular character, just the man's own voice, being all muttery and monotone.   Yuuko A mix of the Let's Dub KS version and Pris from Blade Runner.   Akira Peppermint Patty from Peanuts, but less gravelly.   Hideaki Boy version of Eri Ninamori from FLCL.   Jigoro Richard ""Dick"" Vernon, the assistant principal from The Breakfast Club, but lower pitched.   Iwanako Orihime from Bleach.   Miki Liz from IGPX.   Nomiya Jon Lovitz's Master Thespian character.   Sae Balsa from Moribito.   Meiko Julie Brown (the Just Say Julie one, not the Downtown one), but calmer."

katawashoujo,35e9wz,FirstLight3368,2,Sat May 9 16:12:48 2015 UTC,"I read KS with a few friends in my English class last year, with each of us pitching in a different voice.  Misha: Friend's best attempt at a valley girl when speaking for herself, gruff Japanese man when speaking for Shizune.  Lilly: My own (bad) attempt at a Scottish accent.  Hisao: Christopher Walken.  Emi: My friend's natural, and extremely heavy, Cuban accent.  Rin: A stoner, voiced by an actual stoner."
katawashoujo,35e9wz,Sovietmustache,1 point,Sat May 9 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, whenever I've explained this in the past to my family or friends they told me that I am weird for doing it, but I'm going to say again anyway. When I read anything (aside from like news articles and such), even if its in my head, I assign some sort of voice to every character. However, the way that I assign them has no premeditated reasoning behind it at all and is done completely subconsciously to the point where I have to actually think about what I'm doing to notice it. Whatever voice feels right for the character at the moment they are introduced is what they get. Of course, if they are introduced as an Englishman beforehand for example, then I don't randomly give them a southern US accent.   But, like I said, other than that it is all arbitrary. It just seems like the logical thing to do rather than read a book to yourself where every character has the same voice that exactly matches your inner dialogue. Every time I've explained this to someone they looked at me like I just told them I'm from another planet, so again, take this with a grain of salt. I may be completely out of my mind, but that's just the way it works for me, and I think it makes reading incredibly enjoyable.   So to answer your question in a TL;DR format, yes, I use voices for the characters when I read, but I also may be the world's strangest man."
katawashoujo,35e9wz,GrandmasterSexay,1 point,Sat May 9 15:08:47 2015 UTC,Huh I just realized that apparently I am the only person who doesn't have a voice for shizune. You know because I thought that was the whole point of her disability.

katawashoujo,35e9wz,Arcerias,1 point,Sat May 9 20:13:44 2015 UTC,"I like to read out Jigoro lines as Macho Man Randy Savage.   Strangely enough we both have a few characters down as English, since Hisao was the MC that was played by me, since I play as him. I always had the Doctor down as Welsh or Lyrical Southern though (or a semi-asian influence one) and Mutou as a jaded Scotsman.   For the main girls, Shizune has no voice, so obviously... no voice. Which is strange, I didn't actually give her a defining voice. Lilly was well-spoken with a Scottish twang, Emi was perky American, Misha was pretty much every single female English Dub Anime voice ever since they all sound the damn same, and Hanako was just shy. No real accent, just shy accent."

katawashoujo,35eu0c,Joby05,4,Sat May 9 17:44:51 2015 UTC,Some people think she grows more in Lilly's route than her own. It is interesting to play them back to back but most space them out.
katawashoujo,35eu0c,Dannflor,2,Sat May 9 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"While that's true, you have to keep in mind that Hanako's route covers a much shorter time frame than the others. I'm sure if it had been longer we would have seen Hanako grow even more."
katawashoujo,35eu0c,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sat May 9 18:38:20 2015 UTC,Pretty much this. Another thing to consider is what Hanako knows she wants above just about everything else after those ten years.

katawashoujo,35eu0c,TheDwarfLard,1 point,Sat May 9 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"Hanako's route probably ends around three weeks before Tanabata, assuming the area Yamaku is in celebrates it around the beginning of August and not the beginning of July."

katawashoujo,35dgl4,Sovietmustache,5,Sat May 9 06:38:11 2015 UTC,"Have to be upfront with this as it is my opinion (and perhaps my opinion alone).   Shizune's pre-release is wonderful... it is complete, tells a far better story and really gets you to fall in love with Shizune as a character. You get a lot of insight about her and her story has far more romance. It may not be cannon but IMO it surpasses the cannon in many ways.  Hanakos route... well... is not so good. It is buggy and filled with broken sprites, missing music, typos and poorly written dialogue. I actually stopped in the middle because I couldn't force myself to the end (and haven't played KS since). Not saying her route is bad, but unlike Shizune's route it truly feels like an alpha; something incomplete and broken. Many people have said that her endings are very dark and definitely worth experiencing if you're a Hanako fan. I personally couldn't bring myself to finish but I'm sure at some point I will be able to go back to it.  Hope this helps!"
katawashoujo,35dgl4,Joby05,2,Sat May 9 06:58:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have heard the same thing about Hanako's route and I am definitely still going to play it because Hanako is Best Girl, but thanks for the advice."

katawashoujo,35da0u,gekiganwing,1 point,Sat May 9 05:13:30 2015 UTC,"Ask yourself what activities or things you would rather do. Reading books, comics, or other types of media? Writing or creating something creative? Talking to other people in real life? Exercising or participating in a sport?  Sometimes it's wise to distract yourself from a story. It might be a good idea to find something else to occupy your mind. Sometimes it's wise to address your thoughts directly. Ask yourself questions such as ""What did I learn from KS?"" or ""How can I apply it to my life in the near future?""  Perhaps you will benefit by talking with people in the real world. If so, consider who you can trust. Maybe you can talk with an individual who's an active fan of plot-driven video games or other fiction. Regardless, make sure the person understands the pop culture media that you like.  Incidentally, I wrote this while listening to Amy Grant's song ""Wait for the Healing."""

I'm also currently learning how to play it on the piano.  Cold Iron is one that always gives me a sick feeling in my stomach, but I love it anyway."

The Student Council - Again, feels. Everyday happiness, the feeling of a good day's work put in with friends, and a feeling of normalcy.  Standing Tall - Feels like a decision about to be made, a breakthrough, a change. In other words, what KS did for a lot of us. I somewhat imagined this track playing each time I see a ""thank you KS"" post.  Bonus: Out of the Loop. Blind ranting insane Harry Potter is the best part of Act I."

katawashoujo,35aaim,Celicni,8,Fri May 8 12:52:36 2015 UTC,I would say mostly because it more of an incomplete ending as opposed to a neutral one. To get the good end you pass by the same point again just with better results.
katawashoujo,35aaim,sunfaiz,4,Fri May 8 12:56:22 2015 UTC,To get the good end you pass by the same point again just with better results     thats the point. 100% complete means you have seen all scenes. on your way to the good end you pass through the neutral one. on the other hand for emi your might need to get the good ending two times to catch all scenes.

The white side (Lilly) has some black in it (her more reserved or possibly even sad expression).  While not really applicable here, Yin, the dark side, is evil in life, but there's also good in evil. Yang, the light side, is goodness in life, but there's also evil in good.  Edit: A much more applicable version would that despite Hanako's more sad aspects, there's happiness within her trying to get out.

Spoken Japanese mandates the use of Keigo, an entire system of honorifics that change words around so you are appropriately polite. Sentences that would be perfectly fine in one context would be gravely offensive if you aren't properly conveying your respect in another.  ""Katawa"" literally means ""one wheel"" (like a rickshaw missing a wheel) and more generally translates as ""imperfect"" or even ""deformed"". It's a word that is never polite in Japanese. Its only use is as an insult."

Honorifics in Japanese may be used to emphasize social distance or disparity in rank, or to emphasize social intimacy or similarity in rank.  The system of honorifics in Japan is very extensive, including various levels of respectful, humble, and polite speech, and it closely resembles the honorific systems of the Korean language and, in some elements, Chinese. It includes both special vocabulary and special grammatical forms.  Honorific speech is often longer, sometimes much longer, than more direct speech. Some extreme but not uncommon examples include the following.

katawashoujo,350z76,Atario,1 point,Wed May 6 19:17:30 2015 UTC,"But, it isn't apart of the main game, and I'm fairly sure (can't check) that the author himself considers it non-canon."

It seems this route was intended for the main game but didn't make the cut. Just like what /u/CoffeeDrive said, it's as close to canon you're ever going to get. It may not be 100% canon, but it's pretty close.  And yes he did say something like that. I'm pretty sure his reasoning for saying that was to stop anyone from arguing whether it's canon or not, just like we are :)  I guess it doesn't matter."
katawashoujo,350z76,ShyGuy314,1 point,Wed May 6 13:49:15 2015 UTC,"It's still technically fanon, no matter the writer. Canon is what was in the game, and what was implied in the game.  For example, if I write something now for the VN I'm working on, and the character and plot changes drastically so that it can no longer be used, is it still 'canon', or simply fanon from one of the writers?"
katawashoujo,350z76,Critanium,2,Wed May 6 13:53:43 2015 UTC,"It's a deleted scene alright!? You know how sometimes movies will shoot an entire scene but decide to scrap it from the film? Well this is just that. It's a route that was in the works and I'd imagine it already had a bunch of dialouge done, but then the entire thing was scrapped all together.  The author himself wrote it, it was written within context and was meant to be implemented in the game. This makes it close to canon in mine and other's eyes.   You don't think it's even remotely close to canon? That's fine! But unfortunately, I do. :/"
katawashoujo,350z76,ShyGuy314,1 point,Wed May 6 14:10:24 2015 UTC,I'm sorry. I just don't see either of the characterizations to be palatable to my tastes. I just don't believe that every single work an author writes is undeniably canon. You don't have to get so defensive about it.
katawashoujo,350z76,Critanium,1 point,Wed May 6 14:12:49 2015 UTC,"I guess the yelling made me sound defensive. I just wanted to end this before it dragged on for too long.  What we have here are two opposing opinions, and neither of us are going to admit anything. So I guess that's that then."
katawashoujo,350z76,ShyGuy314,1 point,Wed May 6 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"It might not be canon, but it's definitely not on the same level as others. It has a greater chance of actually becoming canon (even though it won't)."
katawashoujo,350z76,LRats,1 point,Fri May 8 20:32:57 2015 UTC,I don't prefer the style he used. I don't think it came across as... Miki. It felt incredibly vanilla.
katawashoujo,350z76,Critanium,1 point,Fri May 8 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, isn't Miki one of Suriko's characters?"
katawashoujo,350z76,TheDwarfLard,7,Fri May 8 20:52:52 2015 UTC,"The only one that I can think of that is pretty much accepted as canon for a character is Suzu's Pseudo Route by scissorlips.  http://ks.renai.us/viewtopic.php?f=52&t=6192  Otherwise, most others are uncompleted, or have other major competitors. After all, someone could dig up a random character featured in the game for 30 seconds, and craft an entire narrative around her.  But it's not like I've done anything like that..."
katawashoujo,350z76,Critanium,1 point,Wed May 6 05:00:33 2015 UTC,"Just because it isn't canon, it doesn't mean it cannot.  I'll try to explain myself, you can chose anything as canon, you can have a canon where Hisao leaves Yamaku and becomes a chainsaw juggler, everything can be canon along it doesn't change other explicit canon, well all that is IMO, so it might be dead wrong.  Anyway, i think i drifted away from the question, but the reason is that i didn't quite get the question, but i think that pseudorourtes are head canons, or something like that, I.E. Suzu's route is my head canon."

Act 2 and beyond is much better, I feel.   spoiler"

katawashoujo,354sz9,Joby05,1 point,Thu May 7 03:20:50 2015 UTC,"Shizune can only march forward. She has no time and patience for people who take their time and ponder their choices. Unfortunately that is the very definition of Lilly :/ That's why she praise Hisao for daring to attack at two front in the same time in the Risk game. Even if he lost by inexperience he had the guts to think forward, not defensively or conservatively.  With time you will begin to understand her. When she see Hisao she don't see the poor and broken kid that he his now but the man she knows he can become. So she do the only thing she know : force him to march forward."

katawashoujo,354sz9,pgm_01,1 point,Thu May 7 03:25:02 2015 UTC,"From a deaf persons perspective, she is very hosiptile because a lot of people don't care to know her. Without a somewhat regular way to communicate it's difficult for someone to make friends with her. She does warm up to you however"

I sit aghast at my terminal. Was I really thinking of doing this to all my acquaintances at this cripple school? What was I thinking? If I could effortlessly say a 'screw you' to the whole student body in excruciating detail over 400,000 words of scintillating text, I would do it like a shot. Or at least do it like I did with several members of the community in question.  Sadly, it's not effortless and besides I'm already bored. Damn. I let my nerveless fingers drop from the keys.
