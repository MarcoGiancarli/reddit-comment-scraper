Heavymind,3dpupb,pm_if_u_r_calipygian,77,Sat Jul 18 16:07:48 2015 UTC,"Fuck off with the ""so edgy"" and sarcastic ""deep"" circle jerk. It's so boring, this picture took a lot of talent to draw and the message it sends is clear. I don't think the artist was trying to be subtle judging from the choice in palette and the fact that there is nothing else going on in the picture besides the main subject.  Just because you personally consider the message to be overplayed or whatever doesn't make it any less valid, I believe a lot of us can still recognise this picture as somewhat accurate. I mean we DO live in a consumer based society where money and materialism is valued above almost everything.  So what if this isn't the most original concept for a drawing ever conceived, it doesnt mean it doesnt have a right to exist, I guarantee almost all of the people that take place in the ""so edgy"" circlejerk are a bunch of keyboard warriors who spend all day criticizing but never actually contribute a single worthy idea or piece of art of their own.  Ninja edit: If anyone comes to me with some weaksauce ""Just cuz I don't create content doesnt mean I cant criticise it"" bullshit, shut up. Sure, actual criticism can come from any source whether they are skilled in that area or not, it doesn't even have to be constructive if you have a valid point to make. Circlejerking is not real criticism though, its just saying the same fucking thing as everyone else who wants to appear to be smart says.   ...sorry for the rant"
Heavymind,3dpupb,Ghastly_Toilet,36,Sat Jul 18 12:55:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. The response, though, I think, comes from the fact that people on /r/heavymind are used to the eerie and mystifying images that seem to, as a general rule, elude any overt messaging. I just don't think it's what subscribers to this particular sub are interested in seeing."
Heavymind,3dpupb,tekkaiwallace,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:49:35 2015 UTC,"While I'm not a big fan, the fact that it's at +500 upvotes would suggest that it is, in fact, what the people of this sub like."
Heavymind,3dpupb,Fmlwithabaseballbat,14,Sun Jul 19 11:16:22 2015 UTC,"I come here to find art that may have an obvious, overall meaning but is still open to multiple interpretations. Sure we can discuss how loud the image is by its cartoonish color palette and emphasis on the main theme with nothing distracting it, but this isn't the sub for that.  Also quite frankly, this particular theme of excess consumption breeds excess profit/greed which breeds excess consumption and so on has been done to death. This submission is much like Renaissance artwork of the same priest that was made because it was a high selling item. We can appreciate the technical aspect of it and maybe use it to understand its cultural relevance, but we can hardly say it's GREAT art.  I guarantee you this will appear in one of those ""Ten Images That Will Open Your Mind"" albums that always appear on your Facebook feed and have the exact same message we've seen a hundred times before."
Heavymind,3dpupb,twinarteriesflow,4,Sat Jul 18 14:57:49 2015 UTC,"Dude I pretty much agree, I don't think the art is particularly masterful myself, I'm just sick of the ""so edgy"" circle jerk. You on the other hand have actual criticism and insight to contribute."

Heavymind,3dpupb,Ghastly_Toilet,4,Sat Jul 18 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"This picture took a reasonable bit of illustrative skill to draw, not an outstanding amount of talent. I'm an artist so yeah I create content, but you don't need to be a content creator to recognise that this isn't somebody's magnum opus that's getting made fun of here. Nobody's saying it doesn't have a right to exist so I've no idea who you're responding to."
Heavymind,3dpupb,Tinesife,7,Sat Jul 18 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"It has a right to exist, just not here. It's not heavymind, it's another boring ""criticism"" of consumerism that we've all seen 100 times before"

Heavymind,3dpupb,Ghastly_Toilet,2,Sat Jul 18 15:42:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree that it took any talent to draw. There's technical skill involved that they're able to color, shade, and texture through a digital medium but it's honestly not very impressive. And while the message isn't necessarily incorrect, it's horribly uninsightful, and so the whole thing becomes pretty uninteresting. There's nothing to be impressed about except the way that suit jacket looks, because it looks really nice. That's all this piece has going for it."
Heavymind,3dpupb,oldmoneey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"who knows man. let if it speaks to some it has a right to exist, its just not for you.   I just think the metaphor of the piece sucks.

Heavymind,3dpupb,sirMarcy,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:51:53 2015 UTC,"It seems that the most important question to all of Reddit is this: can the depth of meaning of the art be analyzed and appreciated by those beyond the age of 14? 14 seems to be a very key year in the life of many special people. These people seem to become intensely and permanently cynical beyond this age, and by 15 years of age their entire world instantly becomes a shallow pool of shit... and they like it like that. They continue their days scouring the internet for artistic works simply to mention the depth of meaning they would perceive if they were once again 14 years of age... that mystical age. Perhaps a shitty kaleidescope or some doodle of random scribbles the likes of which one might find in the fifth world is just meaningless, chaotic, and shallow enough to appease these post-fourteen year old Redditors who can't swim in the deep end anymore for reasons possibly attributed to a degenerative brain disorder."

Heavymind,3dmub3,kylehasrage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:31:51 2015 UTC,If I buy one of your prints do I need to stretch it on a wood frame or anything? Or just frame it normally? I'm really interested in buying a print of this work particularly.
Heavymind,3dmub3,goslowly_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:53:11 2015 UTC,You can frame it normally if you want. its just personal preference. Thanks man glad you like it!
Heavymind,3dmub3,MCHN7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:24:32 2015 UTC,Definitely bookmarking your page for later. I will be ordering from you very soon. Fantastic artwork.
Heavymind,3dmub3,StarPower1,3,Sat Jul 18 04:24:40 2015 UTC,It would be sick if you glazed in some colors. Although I do also dig the monochromatic nature of this. Good work! Thanks for sharing.

Heavymind,3dk4nx,garygpelow,2,Thu Jul 16 22:34:10 2015 UTC,"Hey Gary, it seems like you've been struggling with some terrifying stuff recently. This isn't the kind of content we normally get in this subreddit, which is why I think that others have downvoted you, but I think it's great that you're using your voice, expressing yourself, and trying to spread awareness of what it's like to live with schizophrenia. Stay strong and take care."
