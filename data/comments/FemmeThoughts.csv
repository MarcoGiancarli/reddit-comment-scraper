Whenever someone speaks of androgyny, I almost always think of a femininish male.   ((My personal opinion here...)) I don't get why we idolize her at all, in terms of androgyny. To me,she doesn't look androgynous - she looks very feminine to me. Its just something I've not quite gotten."

Her style may be androgynous, but her actual features are not.  In my eyes she's got extremely feminine features (those lips!) and bone structure, and I don't think it's a bad thing at all.

FemmeThoughts,3duhpy,lemoche,29,Sun Jul 19 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Honestly, if folks want to get rid of sex work (and in turn reduce sex trafficking by making it more visible), the best way to do that is to make it unnecessary. The vast, vast majority of people in the sex trade are there because they need the money.  Whether it's because they physically can't work steady 9-5 style jobs or regular shift work, whether it's because they need flexibility in their schedule, whether no one's hiring full-time and their options are 2-3 part time min wage jobs that won't make ends meet, etc. etc. people enter because it's better money. That's capitalism at work there. It's people, largely women, saying ""Fuck working 60-80+ hours a week at minimum wage across 1-3 jobs, I'll work half that and make the same amount or more doing sex work.""  Making sex work illegal? Making it harder for sex workers to make ends meet? Just hurts the impoverished sex workers the most. It makes them more vulnerable to violence from clients (who are more likely to be criminals under these circumstances, and who they can't communicate with prior to meeting), from the police (who are often the largest source of violence against sex workers), more likely to get evicted, more likely to have to work on the street where it's generally more dangerous, less likely to get any legal aid if they are victims of assault (especially when certain activists claim all full service sex work is rape, diluting the impact on what rape is and isn't), more likely to be deported, more likely to end up with a criminal record that will harm their ability to get work outside of sex work, more likely to get pushed into predatory ""exit"" programs that use and abuse them for slave labour, etc. etc.  Folks want to get rid of sex work? Get rid of capitalism, that's at the root of this. Until then, it's better to support sex workers and listen to them about how to help them, how to provide them safer lives, etc. Being shortsighted and trying to kill sex work, only to funnel those workers into minimum wage(or worse paid) work that carries its own health concerns, often requiring former sex workers to work far more hours than before, for far less money, less capability of financial survival...that's not a valid exit program. Have a system in place before that...have something like minimum income, or negative income tax, or something like that to ensure those leaving sex work, and all other low-income folks, won't be burning themselves out on low-wage labour to survive.  Like, the quote ""We can’t abandon people"" stated by one of those pro-abolitionists. Which, sure, I agree with. So where are the 25-30k paying jobs for sex workers leaving the industry? Where's the loan-free paid post-secondary education? Where are the anti-poverty social programs that ensure regular folk don't have to overwork and burn themselves out just to keep a roof over their head? You want to get people out of sex work, make it feasible under capitalism until you can dismantle capitalism.   Don't make it illegal like the Nordic model does (no, selling isn't technically illegal, but participating in the purchase of sex certainly can be, so it's not exactly doing much of anything for sex workers except scaring off a lot of clients, driving them further into poverty, and making them more vulnerable to other sex-work-related charges). Canada's new legislation is particularly vile, and I could go on for a long time about it, but...ugh. It's a little too emotionally draining for a Sunday afternoon  Ultimately, I used to be pro-abolition until I saw the harm that it did. I'm unwilling to put ideology over human lives and suffering, these days. If we want to minimize sex work, we need to eliminate poverty. That's how we start. That's how we move forward without harming vulnerable populations."
FemmeThoughts,3duhpy,lockedge,3,Sun Jul 19 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that capitalism is definitely a part of the problem and could be done away with, but what would you replace it with and how would you know that this new system wouldn't create new problems that would lead to similar symptoms?"
FemmeThoughts,3duhpy,see996able,2,Sun Jul 19 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agree on this, though id like to add one small note, if poverty is a driving factor for prostitution, these woman usually end up on the lower spectrum in the trade, they are the most vulnerable to be exploited. Whereas there are some that make the conscious choice to go into sex work without the need, which end up being far more secure, they dont need any client and can refuse some.  This holds true for countrys where it has been legalized.  This is also a argument against the pay sex work gives, a woman that has been driven to it by poverty will not make a lot of money and often has to take clients that will abuse her, or end up with traffickers and pimps that exploit her situation. To stop that part, it needs to be decriminalized and the woman given a support network as well a safety net against poverty.  And yes, there are woman that consciously do get into the trade because they like it, but these are as i said, not the ones at real risk.  Hope i could get my point across, still on my first coffee....  edit My source is personal experience, in both setting up support a network and helping woman escape the exploitation, as well as having worked as escort and having throughly enjoyed it (and i often refused clients which i know would had been bad)"

Rather than scrutinizing the deregulation to ensure an explosion of exploitation doesn't happen, it's like they said, ""sure, fine, it's deregulated... Can we go back to doing more important things?""  I mean, how do you not have inspectors doing random inspections on cathouses for legal papers on the women, drug testing them to prevent the get-em-addicted-to-make-em-stay type of coercion, STD testing to prevent/heal any infections, rates of condom usage, compliance with medical/dental/therapy appointments, auditing the women's HR files and ensuring their soft/hard limits for work and clients are being respected, auditing police calls and blotters to ensure the internal security is at an acceptable level and that all SOPs are followed, OSHA-type laws that require a minimum acceptable standard for the health and safety of their workers.  Basically, it sounded like they legalized it with little fanfare and even less regulation, allowing the already-exploited to remain exploited, only legally this time.  TL;DR: sex work is not the problem; having a society so ashamed of sex work that it would claim ""empowerment"" of women while disempowering them to real social change is the problem."

Having to register, means their names are known and could be leaked, much harder to do this job anonymously.  Especially problematic for sex workers who still have a ""real"" job.    Most exploitation is usually with young women from Eastern, lots of them possibly here illegally... They can put pressure on them that they would be sent back, mostly into societies where they would be social outcasts as former prostitutes, so they keep working... And they just seldom catch the traffickers... The only thing helping those women would be letting them stay legally... But our gouvernment and  immigration... Nah, that won't work"

Follows it with a bunch of vague rhetoric about how sex work is bad because capitalism (but of course sex work needs to be treated much more harshly than other capitalist work, because).   Lee Lakeman, one of Canada’s most important radicals, and several members of the Vancouver Rape Relief & Women’s Shelter,   Hey, anyone recognize those names? You should! They're responsible for one of the highest-profile cases of discrimination against trans women by a feminist organization! It went all the way to the Canadian Supreme Court (for all their ""radical"" rhetoric, they're quite happy to wield the force of the currently existing society to back up their discrimination), who ultimately enshrined their discrimination as legal precedent.

If you mean that I don't want it to be illegal, then yes, I support sex work.  I you think that I am going to advocate it as a profession to my students, well then, think again.  I personally believe, and everyone is free to disagree, that prostitution leads men to think of women as objects that can be used, bought, and sold.  That being said, one could argue that companies look at labor in the same way.  But the point is that I am (on moral grounds) against prostitution.  But I am also a realist.  I know that the system that we have employed in the US is a failure, we have criminalized it without providing an adequete relief system.  Criminalization might be effective in Norway in Sweden, but somehow I imagine that it's not the criminalization that was effective but instead the social programs in place designed to provide the relief from poverty that actually made the largest difference.  I am sure there are a few women out there who actually want to be prostitutes, but I think most of us can agree that women are usually either tricked or pressured into sex work.  We can reduce the number of women who fall into that category by providing women with better social programs."
FemmeThoughts,3duhpy,DOTAVICE,6,Mon Jul 20 06:00:33 2015 UTC,"That's basically how I feel. I support sex workers. I don't support sex work.

FemmeThoughts,3duhpy,DOTAVICE,6,Mon Jul 20 06:04:21 2015 UTC,"but IMO the long-term ultimate goal would be for sex work not to exist at all.   That's not a realistic goal, and enforcing policies designed to achieve that will have negative results.  There will always be people looking to purchase sex, and as I said, there are some people, who do consent to it, are willing to sell sex.  If we make it illegal, (pursue a policy to make it non existent) we will be giving up our opportunity to regulate it and make it as safe as it can be for all involved.  This is one of those things where its important to remember that morals should be separate from laws, or at least not used to create laws.  We have established a set of rights for all people, and so long as we can find a way for prostitution to exist within those rights, it should be legal.    The problem is that when people's options are limited, it gets harder to argue that the consented to it.  Did a woman with no social safety net choose to be a prostitute?  Well she might have chosen that over not eating, or sleeping outside, but it wasn't a choice that anyone should have to make, and it's easy to see how many of these women's hands are tied.  The end goal shouldn't be to make it non existent, but to make sure that people's rights aren't violated in sex work.  That is something that we can actually achieve, or at least hope to achieve.  And creating laws around that goal, and support programs around that goal, will result in the best case scenario for those involved in sex work, even for the clients."

Regarding dropout rates; from the same survey:    Gender bias  exists as 55% of the dropouts were girls. In urban areas  too, the share of  girls in out of school children  was 58%   She is not only misleading, she is outright lying. From the same survey:   The enrollment ratio of girls improved significantly resulting in  gender parity ratio of 0.89 in rural and 0.82 in urban  schools.   Despite girls being 89% and 82% of the boys who attend school, they make up 55% and 58% of the students who dropout of school before the 10th grade. I have issues with the way she is trivializing things while accusing ""western"" organizations of doing the same.    She equates the Red tent movement to menstrual huts; while red tents are to celebrate being a woman, menstrual huts are no where close to it. There are relegated to an obscure corner of the street so that woman cannot be easily seen entering or exiting the hut. The concept of menstrual huts is not that common now aside from some indigenous tribes. She also needs to learn about the Hippie movement that she thinks is pretentious while encouraging spiritualism via her own organization.    Hinduism and Jainism look down upon menstruating women with disgust while Buddhism is ambivalent to it. Sikhism is the only religion that actively tries to discourage discrimination of menstruating women. But that is all based on theological understanding, it varies wildly from a household to household(My mom and dad never gave much weight to menstruation but uncle discriminated my aunt(dad's sister) during her periods).    What we do need is a simple solution of providing information in schools and communities on maintaining menstrual hygiene, be it with cloth or pads. And leave it to women to decide what they wish to use.   I totally agree with her on this, but the last part of that is still something of a taboo. Women still do not have much choice in what they want to do, and she wants to maintain status quo.. which is extremely confounding.   For more cringe, watch her TedX video"

FemmeThoughts,3dlkc1,ruchenn,53,Fri Jul 17 06:42:14 2015 UTC,"The other scorn I received was along the lines of “You should be grateful you even have children,” with great offense taken by some who have lost a child, or can’t conceive a child.   I don't understand this. I really really don't because that is so out of line to say to this person and incredibly assholeish. I don't care how much you are grieving, you don't deserve to drag someone else down over something so stupid."
FemmeThoughts,3dlkc1,Subclavian,29,Fri Jul 17 14:39:57 2015 UTC,"Really, all of it is incredibly out of line to say to a person. Who are you to ask about a person's fertility history?"

FemmeThoughts,3dlkc1,Subclavian,24,Fri Jul 17 14:52:21 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. When my sister was pregnant, people would constantly go over to her and touch her belly and ask all sorts of questions. I suppose there's some of that ""children are the communal future"" mentality involved, or the idea that she's not a person in and of herself, but rather a vessel and caretaker for children. It's weird and incredibly inappropriate."

Even if the complaint is valid, we get told that we're over reacting or that someone else has it worse. It's as if we're never allowed to strive for better anything."
FemmeThoughts,3dlkc1,Subclavian,15,Fri Jul 17 18:14:07 2015 UTC,I don't get it either.  I lost a daughter to a fatal birth defect.  So I get the loss thing.  I get how it can be overwhelming. But that doesn't have a single thing to do with this.  There is nothing at all in the photo to make you think the woman is not grateful for her kids.  It barely has to do with her kids at all; it has to do with others' reactions to them.

I felt bad for both the author and this lady, but I can't imagine the mental state of that woman, who sent those pictures. To see a joking picture and be so affected that she felt this was the right reaponse, my heart hurts for her because she is not okay right now, and I can't even blame her one ounce. I really hope she has somebody in her life to help her. :("

I'm sure anyone who has raised or even been around twins can relate to this photo, and honestly probably most parents could as well.  But when this photo was posted on reddit, I saw people calling her all types of sexist slurs or saying she was rude or ungrateful or overdramatic--all for a funny, relatable photo she wanted to share with friends."

Beyond that complaint, and essentially all the complaints she listed in the article are simply ridiculous. I would not have apologized for a single one of them. The list she posted on her twins was funny and should have been left at that. Anyone who took offense should have examined their own reasons for complaining."

I'm tired of the idea that there's one correct way to be a woman. ""Feminine"" should be just as broad as the range of women in the world - it should apply just as well to those among us with muscular, powerful physiques as it does to those who are more dainty.  This is why I'm so fond of the ""like a girl"" campaign. Being a woman is already widely regarded as the less preferable sex to be, why do we have to go further and shit on the ones who don't conform to the delicate image? The common sentiment when looking at Serena should be that she's someone worth trying to emulate, rather than this upsetting trend of questioning her womanhood."

I'm a big sports fan in general, and watch mostly hockey and football specifically. Being Canadian, I also recently had the pleasure of seeing some of the Women's World Cup in my city. I tend to go to my local sports bar to watch games and matches and I certainly heard many of those ""not female looking"" type comments. I tried to shut them down as best I could, saying things like ""does it really matter"", but I didn't really want to turn a pleasant evening into a feminist/political argument with other bar-folk. However, and what was encouraging, was that there were usually at least two or three of us female regulars hanging around who would call people out when comments like that came up. It was never a thing we tried to do, just an unspoken acknowledgement that it needed to be done and it was up to us to take up the mantle.   Also encouraging is the continued support (perhaps mostly in my own circle?) of women's hockey. They are greatly respected as athletes and ambassadors of their sport, not with all fans, but the tide is definitely changing. Actually r/hockey is a pretty cool place for female fans of the sport."

You're super welcome! :3   I tend to go to my local sports bar to watch games and matches and I certainly heard many of those ""not female looking"" type comments.

""You know why that is, right?""  ""Cause they're afraid to break a nail!""  Mexico, similar to Japan and other countries where hyper-macho culture is the norm, has so much overt sexism it borders on the surreal.   what was encouraging, was that there were usually at least two or three of us female regulars hanging around who would call people out when comments like that came up   I've made my family and friends (and then my friend's friends by proxy) get much better at doing the same thing. It's all kinds of things, from yelling at bad drivers on the road:  ""God damn women drivers!""  ""More like shitty drivers. When a man does that, you don't say ""damn man drivers"" do you?""  And of course cracking down on sexist slurs. Some people have a hard time letting go of those, but generally those open-minded enough let it go when you explain to them why it is it perpetuates oppression through microaggression theory.

The only ""progressive"" policies that do pass are those that take power away from no one, or are supported by a mass movement of people threatening change. If we want to see true change, the kind of change that would tend to our social needs instead of the pursuit of exchange value and profits for millionaires and corporations, we need to change the base economic system.   as more and more moms enter the workforce with their country’s best wishes, there’s been worryingly little progress on federal policies that support them. As John Oliver put it in his acidic Mother’s Day takedown of the U.S.’s lack of workplace protections for moms, “You can't have it both ways. You can’t go on and on about how much you love mothers and then fail to support legislation that makes life easier for them.""   Lip service is all women will get under this system. Capitalists will always try to shift externalities over onto working people, such as childcare, healthcare, domestic support, etc.  Capitalism and Patriarchy, a true love affair that screws over workers, and working women more so."

A young man sits down beside him, this is the son. Dialogue ensues.  “Dad?” The son asks.  “Hmm?”  “Can I go make an appointment to see your man doctor?”  The father turns to look at his son and the title screen appears with the following: Buzzefeed Presents “If Buying Condoms Was Like Buying Birth Control”.  “Is everything okay?” The father asks.  “Yeah, yeah. It's—”  “You're not still worried about your testicles being two different sizes, are you?”  “No! I just wanna be safe!” The son says, somewhat outraged.  The father turns away from his son, a look of frustration on his face.  “Allison and I—” The son begins.  “Allison and I,” The father mimics, irritated.  The son remains quiet as his father slams the book shut and sits up from the couch.  “Tina! What time is dinner?!”  We cut to a scene where the father and son are at the clinic. The two of them are sitting in the waiting room. As the nurse approaches, she calls out the son's name.  “Igor?” She asks.  “You, uh, want me to go in with you?” Igor's father asks.  “No,” Igor says.  “Okay...” The father says as the son walks out of the camera shot along with the nurse. “Just taking care of my family,” he says to himself whilst flipping through the pages of a magazine.  We're presented with another scene. We see Igor dressed in a patient's medical gown, along with a female doctor, in the examining room.  “Hi Igor, what brings you in today?” The doctor asks. She approaches Igor with a clip board.  “Well my girlfriend and I—” Igor begins to say.  “Sit back on the table,” the Doctor interrupts, pushing him to lean backwards.  “Oh-okay.”  “Are you here for condoms?” The doctor asks.  “Yes... please,” Igor says.  “Spread your legs,” the doctor says. “Are you currently having sexual intercourse?”  “Define intercourse.”  “Have you experienced discharge?”  “Not now.”  “Okay. I'm gonna check your chest for cancer.” She proceeds to palpate his chest. “Okay now I'm going to do an invasive physical exam.”  The doctor puts on a sterile glove. “This is gonna hurt,” she tells Igor.  Igor gasps as the procedure begins.  We cut to another scene where Igor is on his cellphone. The setting appears to be a University or School computer lab.  “I need to fill my prescription,” he says. “For condoms...” he whispers.  Not hearing him, the voice on the other line replies:   “What?”  “For condoms!” Igor says louder.  A student sitting next to him turns her head and eyes him curiously, somewhat amused.  “I have to check to see if we have any in stock,” the voice on the other line says. “Please hold, sir...”  “Really?!” Igor asks. He glances awkwardly around him.  We cut to a following scene where Igor is in line at a pharmacy. We see a pharmacy tech, or pharmacist, typing at a computer terminal, ask him the following:  “Do you have insurance?”  “No,” Igor replies.  “That'll be one hundred and fifty dollars,” the pharmacist/tech says. “Hope it's worth it.”  Igor looks distraught as he pays and picks up the package of condoms.  We close with the final scene of the video: Igor sitting on the couch with Allison.  “Do you wanna have sex?” Allison asks.  “Sure!” Igor says.  Igor reaches down to grab the packet of condoms but notices it's empty.  “Oh shit... I forgot to refill my prescription.”  “Just go buy more,” Allison says.  Igor shakes his head. “That's not how it works. “I gotta wait seven days.”  Allison sighs and turns away. “Ugh. You really need to be more responsible with the birth control.”  “Well... maybe you could take responsibility for the birth control from now on...” Igor says.  Allison pouts, leans her head against Igor's shoulder and says: “But baby... then it won't feel as good...”  The video concludes with messages of “Subscribe for more wonderful things”. Music: Happy, Warner/Chappell Production Music. Links to other videos and a few out-takes.  Outtakes feature a scene where Igor and his father are still discussing his initial request to see the urologist.  “What did you say? You said you were getting serious?” Igor's father asks.  “It's—” Igor begins to say but is immediately interrupted.  “I don't wanna hear nananana...” Igor's father says over him.  The video shows more colourful links with the words. “For more wonderful things subscribe to Buzzfeed Blue” and “SUBSCRIBE”.  “Dad I—”  “DUNANAMAMA...”  “Do you want me to—”  “What if the people at church found out about this, hmm?” Igor's father asks. “What about that!”  Igor sits there, mouth agape.  “I can't volunteer any more!” Igor's father says and slams his book shut. “Can I?!”  End."

I don't know if you're a doctor and have had a different experience, but almost all of my female colleagues will/have waited until they're much further their training before having children so the idea of second shift isn't so much of an issue to separate them.

And fair enough, I get the anecdotal evidence. However second shift isn't purely about childrearing, that's only the most easily noticeable element. It also has to do with taking care of the elderly, the infirm and performing domestic labour that maintains the Capitalist economic system. Women also lack the kind of societal support that men receive when it comes to such endeavours, making the stresses more burdensome. It's a credit to women that peoeple such as yourself are able to shoulder it and still become the amazing professionals that you are."

It's written by a female author, has a female heroine who starts off with low self-esteem but overcomes that and learns to love those things about herself.  The story itself is a really good ""I wish I could be her and do that"" one for girls. In a similar way to how Batman and Harry Potter provide similar escapism for boys. It was actually the first one like that I came across growing up. I always had a hard time relating to boys in those sort of stories so it was nice to find it in a girl one. I think I read all the ones that were out at the time (I think three or four) over the course of two weeks after school.  If I reread it, the story would probably seem a little tacky and the character would seem overpowered, but since it's for kids, they likely haven't come across the tropes in the books and the overpowered aspect is probably appealing.  That said, I haven't reread them as an adult, so I'm unsure if they have any problematic elements, but from my memory, they don't. The two bad guys in the beginning are women, but IIRC it turns out they're just really unsuited for their jobs and become an Amelia Earhart-style pilot and a famous chef respectively by the end. Still, I'd give it a quick read before-hand to make sure.  I think it's actually turning into a movie this year, but I'm a little worried that it'll lose something that made the books special. We'll see how it goes, anyway."

It's this massive hypocrisy and mispriorization as human beings that makes me stick to the edges mostly (TrollX, my local sub, knitting and crochet, other niches).  Ellen Pao was not the ideal CEO.

I think even the trolls are burned out and while some of the anti-Pao circle jerk will think they won a ""victory"", I think it just left non-redditors wondering why this whole thing was popping up on their Facebook feed.

FemmeThoughts,3cv04k,Plowbeast,24,Sat Jul 11 11:13:22 2015 UTC,"Reddit gets itself into a tizzy over devs not delivering mod tools in five seconds or Victoria or whatever   A couple points here. Reddit is run by moderators. Mods have been pissed off about the devs not delivering mod tools for years. The demands that the mods have made of the devs haven't been absurdly over the top, far from it. We've been asking for the same basic things over and over, and most importantly, we've been asking for communication and consistency.   And with Victoria - the admins fired Victoria, didn't tell the mods and had no back-up in place. And then, when they offered one, it involved major fundamental differences, including monetization and no transparency (Victoria wouldn't allow PR people to answer questions pretending to be actors and so on).   Lots of mods have serious problems with the ideals of reddit and how it's run in terms of harassment, safety, hatred and bigotry. Not all, but many. But those of us who do don't all agree on the issues, or how to handle them and so on. But all mods can unite over super basic things that have easy solutions. Getting rid of an existing working system and not letting the mods know - we all agree it's a problem, and we can all agree on demands.  What happened here was that there was a severe and urgent issue with functionality, one that was so bad it had to be communicated to the users. And the mods of other subs who are very unhappy with how the devs are handling moderation issues, and how its getting worse, not better, used their limited powers to force the admins to do something.  I absolutely understand and agree with why so many of the subs went dark. The real issue is that the users who didn't like Pao used this as an excuse, and blamed her. It's only an educated guess, but I'm fairly certain that the things the mods (including myself) have been pissed off by were not her vision."

It's like ""Wow Reddit made this change (or failed to implement one I wanted) I don't like"" and ""Wow the person in charge is a woman!"".  Combine those and you will get some serious hate.

Redditors who seemed to be the majority seemed unable to handle an Asian woman running the place where they spend most of their time and they especially took issue with her deciding to take a stand against harassment that reached out to the real world and other sites.

FemmeThoughts,3csmxv,see996able,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:02:11 2015 UTC,"One reason why many algorithms have shifted toward data driven machine learning is because it performs better. The fewer human biases and priors that an algorithm is subjected to, the better the performance. These algorithms take a snapshot of how things are, but they are not designed to consider how things could/should be. Instead, we use them to make decisions, decisions that get turned into new data that gets fed back to the algorithm creating a feedback loop that reinforces what the algorithm already found.  So the problem is with us and how we interpret and apply those results. I believe one solution could be to create new laws or better enforce old ones to prevent discrimination. Those algorithms are basically screaming to us that these biases still exist, so it is up to us to correct them. Unfortunately, I don't have much faith in this happening because it requires companies getting educated and taking responsibility for their actions (LOL), and it means lawmakers realizing how the use of these technologies can negatively impact us.  I don't think there will be any solution on the machine learning side, because it is not the cog in the system that is actually driving the change (or rather status quo). Though it would certainly help to better educate both the creators and users of this technology to understand its limitations."
FemmeThoughts,3csmxv,Adahn5,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:23:28 2015 UTC,"Since I'm a dirty lil commie, obviously my answer would be to do away with Capitalism. This reasoning stems from the fact that the Capitalist mode of production always follows and promotes whatever is lucrative in order to satisfy the profit motive. Generally it means Capitalism will be male-centric, and favour men over women because employing male workers guarantees a supposedly more stable workforce.  To a Capitalist, the fact that a woman might become pregnant, take time off, and subsequently be a drain on the enterprise's resources whilst simultaneously putting down productivity, is the reason why women face sexist questions at interviews, are paid less than men are, and are generally denigrated in the workplace. Don't even get me started on how hostile a workplace can be toward working mothers. Additionally, Capitalism favours women to remain in traditional gender roles of wife and mother because it sustains and maintains the base economic system and model of production.   The working-class family is the system’s economic unit, an integral part of the reproduction of capitalist relations. As a necessary component of the wage form of exploitation, capitalism imposes a sexual division of labor. Women are obliged to fulfill the wife/mother role in order to ensure the system a steady supply of labor power.  There are two aspects to the reproduction of the proletariat and its labor power. In the “traditional” capitalist family, for the daily revival of the male laborer—his eating, sleeping, minding his health and just unwinding in order to replenish his ability to work effectively for the boss the next day—his wife cooks food, cleans house and clothing and provides nurture in less measurable ways. The second aspect, the replacement of one generation of the workforce by the next, includes the woman’s biological role in giving birth and her social role in rearing children.  As with any commodity, the value of labor power is based on the value of the means of subsistence necessary for the worker’s maintenance and reproduction. This cost must be covered by the workers’ wage. Thus the wage is not an individual payment; it also has to maintain all family members who do not work. But while the wage reflects the value of labor power, this value is not just the bare minimum needed for physical survival. As Marx states:   The number and extent of his so-called necessary requirements, as also the manner in which they are satisfied, are themselves products of history, and depend therefore, to a great extent on the level of civilization attained by a country; in particular, they depend on the conditions in which, and consequently on the habits and expectations with which, the class of free workers has been formed. In contrast, therefore, with the case of other commodities, the determination of the value of labor power contains a historical and moral element. (Capital, Volume I, Chapter 6)    Source."

Of the feminists I've met IRL, very few have done any reading outside of any of the required literature from a Women's Literature course or Women in History course in college.  It's very important to get smart about Feminism. To read people like Angela Davis, like Voltairine de Cleyre, like Bell Hooks, Silvia Federici, Judith Butler, Leslie Feinberg and so on. It's the only way one can have a clearer understanding of what it is we fight for, but how to fight, how to build an argument, and how to carry it forth in our analysis, criticisms and our daily life."

Feminism is for everyone, as Bell Hooks wrote, and people should try to learn what it's about—especially Feminists. Why shouldn't you know what the movement stands for? Knowledge is power, and it's what keeps us from falling into the same kind of straw man bullcrap that MRAs use on us every day.  ""Feminism seeks dominance over men, feminism seeks the death of all men, feminists want to tie all women's fallopian tubes, and give men vasectomies"", and so on.  To give you a better example. I have a friend who identified as a feminism a while ago, and when I asked her who was her favourite feminist thinker, she drew a blank stare. I asked what she thought Feminism was, and said it was equality for women. I asked her about Patriarchy and she didn't know what that was. Her response, to me, felt like that of a cheering fan rather than a thinker.  I don't consider it elitist to want my fellow feminists to educate themselves at least on the bare bones essentials. It's how we suck the power away from the Liberal ""Choice"" Feminism that existing power structures have co-opted to diminish subversive forms of Feminism, and it's how we keep focused on Women's Liberation, and not Hillary Clinton worship."

FemmeThoughts,3cceoh,girlinboots,15,Mon Jul 6 20:39:15 2015 UTC,"If I were going to write about sexism in craft brewing, beer names are not where I would start.  I went to the Craft Brewers' Conference this year, and there were a few interesting things I noticed. Some are small things -- like the fact there was often a line for men's restrooms, and never one for the women's (an inverse of the usual). Some are larger things -- like the drunk dude who thought it was ok to feel me up, or the gentleman that was SO OFFENDED the Pink Boots Society's meeting was women-only (""But that's sexist!! You're discriminating against me because I'm a man!!"")  In my local homebrew scene, it's been interesting to watch this dynamic begin to shift.  When I first got involved 10 years ago, there were pretty much no women brewing, and only a couple of wives/girlfriends that would go to meetings.  I was initially very put off.  Now, we have several women that brew in their own right, and a handful of couples that are equally invested in the hobby.  It's been interesting watching the old guard adjust to the change -- at the last meeting, I was told ""No offence, I don't want to be sexist, but [your beer] is a REALLY GIRLY beer.""  On the other hand, an older member of our officer's group insisted it was VERY IMPORTANT we have pink and purple Tshirts this year, as a nod to the rising female population of the club.    I think getting more women involved with craft beer -- at all levels of the subculture, from homebrew through professional brewing -- will ultimately take care of the sexist brew names.  Things like ""raging bitch IPA"" seem less funny when there's actually a woman in the room going ""wait, really??""."

I saw this article come across my facebook newsfeed via Girls Pint Out (great group of ladies if you have a chance to meet up with a local chapter).  While I can't say that I've spent any time really pondering the issue of beer naming, I do know I have consciously made the decision not to purchase any of these beers when I've seen them in the store. Some of them read great, but I just can't bring myself to buy something with such a terrible name. My initial reaction most times isn't even ""OMG that's so sexist!"" It's more, ""Wow, that's a super gross name. Blech."" The beer becomes unappetizing all at once, and when I'm buying a beer because it's supposed to be tasty and not just to get fucked up, well, it seems like these breweries are working against themselves.

FemmeThoughts,3c7ayu,coffeejeong,28,Sun Jul 5 15:35:06 2015 UTC,"Some titles have women lead characters. But we still live in a culture where naughty dog had to fight hard and make threats to Sony to keep Ellie on the cover of The last of us, and to give her more real estate on the box than the guy whose name I can't quite recall. We live in a world where Elizabeth was stripped away from bioshock infinite's box art because the publisher didn't believe it'd be good to have a woman on the front cover in an FPS game. We live in a world where most of the better women leads are from games with self-insert characters (Mass Effect, for instance), which generally only do animations for the man model, and cross their fingers that things work out when translating those to the woman model's rig. We live in a world where women characters are still largely afterthoughts.   Sure, there are probably a few hundred decent or better games out there with women lead characters, but compared to the tens of thousands of games with men characters...yeah, I'm not satisfied. Someone can't hand me Bayonetta and make me feel better about the 100 games with men leads released that fiscal quarter for that platform. it's the equivalent, IMO, of someone saying ""What do you mean you want more LGBT representation on TV? There's that Fosters show. What else could you possibly want?""  Fact is, games with women main characters, so long as they're not trainwrecks, tend to do very well. Media with broader representation tends to sell better than games with narrow representation. Financially, there's really very little reason for so many white men characters to lead games when it's not the best financial decision, and certainly not the best creative ones as well, given the stories over the years about devs having to change their lead characters to what producers and investors wanted instead.   This article adds more games to the mix that proves what a lot of people already know...that games with women leads can be quite successful. From big dev studios to small ones, there aren't any barriers to success except investors looking for safety in sexism and racism."

Like it or not gender is a part of your identify, wherever you fall on the spectrum. Gender influences how we perceive the world by influencing how the world perceives us. Gender and identity are deeply intertwined. I get the sentiment - that we shouldn't let a person's gender change how we feel about their thoughts and ideas, and we shouldn't pre judge based on gender - but I don't think that it's correct to pretend like we don't define ourselves through gender and ignore the huge influence it has on our lives."

Feminism is bashed for 'focusing on women as victims""- Though I don't personally know how you are supposed to talk about feminism without acknowledging WHY its needed.  I've said this before but I'll repeat it:  Some people just don't seem to get that many people reddit on coffee breaks, or while pooping and are approaching topics with an attitude of ""Oh, here's what I think/feel"". Instead they seem to see every thread as a battle field, they imagine we are all sitting at a keyboard with hours of time to give, ready to try and win with the best statements, backed up with links, research, and powerful arguments. They treat Reddit like a debate competition with high stakes.  and its rarely that these people genuinely want to make the world better, their just the type of people who get their kicks from feeling like they've ""won"" internet arguments. I totally get that people want to discuss things a long the line of a certain topic, and not have to go on the defense, trying to create airtight arguments, find studies to back up anything you ever said.  When a subs community don't want to spend all their time convincing outsiders, and defending their own thoughts and ideas, they get branded an ""echo chamber"" and shit all over for it."

FemmeThoughts,3bplkb,annarchy8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"People coming from places like 4Chan are naturally going to be prone to calling ""fake"" e.g. on rape stories.  Stories often submitted by historyless anons can much more easily be fake, and deception and trolling are high-status activities there.  Lulz are the most highly valued currency and earnestness is derided.  A few years of that does not a good Redditor make.    A lot of those doubting comments come from that fraction of young people who have not developed empathy yet.  Which leaves their cleverness and ego as the salient issues.  And then there are those for whom rape is a political football - the MRAs, Red Pillers, Gamergators, ForeverAlones and so on.  They are like religious fanatics - once you realise who you are talking to any replies should only be for the benefit of onlookers.  You won't get anywhere with the person themselves but they might provide a good opportunity for educating the crowd, if you are up to it and can keep your temper.  Don't underestimate them, I often see SJWs do poorly against them in arguments.    If they are not used to the culture of support forums they have likely never thought about the damage that doubt can do.  I just point that out to them - ""imagine that half the stories are fake, think about the damage done by doubting the genuine half"".  Quite often they respond positively to that, and if they don't then many other people will have seen the idea. It would never occur to many people to even read the sidebar on a forum, let alone follow the links."

As an aside, one thing I've noticed in my limited association with people-who-definitely-aren't-junkies-and-can-stop-if-they-want-to-but-always-come-back-to-it is that it seems to poison the soul.  Empathy appears to get blunted or at least deprioritised.    There are better drugs for what you need and they are relatively dirt cheap.

FemmeThoughts,3bp8dk,keakealani,7,Wed Jul 1 03:39:03 2015 UTC,"I like this article, with one exception. I do think that it's totally rational to still feel a repulsion to a word even in a neutral, describing-the-word context. Even in this case, even though I'm not Black, I think it would have been in better taste to censor the word because, if for no other reason, semantic saturation has the tendency to devalue the overall meaning of the word.   Now, I don't think this means we always need to jump through a thousand hoops to talk about a slur, but I think sticking a couple stars there does highlight the point that slurs have tremendous power to hurt others and carry a lot of baggage. Should someone who had a previously traumatic experience with that slur happen to read this article, they may intellectually know that the word is meant in a descriptive, neutral sense, but they may have uncontrollable gut feelings that occur before that intellectual understanding is established. This isn't just a ""trigger warning"" game, it's the possibility of trivializing the experience of a slur by someone who cannot have a first-hand understanding of that experience.   I mean, I think this usage is a thousand times better than the actual insults or gleeful mockery that the article discusses, but I'm not sure we're in quite the position, especially with this particular word, to be so blasé."
FemmeThoughts,3bp8dk,muntcake,7,Wed Jul 1 03:17:39 2015 UTC,"I heard it described somewhere as either saying ""there was a car crash and someone died"" or ""there was a car crash and the person was thrown from the car and all of their limbs were broken"".

FemmeThoughts,3bp8dk,keakealani,5,Wed Jul 1 03:28:31 2015 UTC,"That seems reasonable. And again, takes into consideration context (which the article sort of does when talking about children, but I think it goes even just beyond age). There are probably times where having a graphic description of a death is appropriate (say, in detailed medical reports), but generally not in the public world. Same goes with slurs. There are a few cases where it may be very important for clarity or because the context calls for extreme detail, but generally not in the public world."
FemmeThoughts,3bp8dk,cordis_melum,6,Wed Jul 1 03:31:04 2015 UTC,"I do think that it's totally rational to still feel a repulsion to a word even in a neutral, describing-the-word context. Even in this case, even though I'm not Black, I think it would have been in better taste to censor the word because, if for no other reason, semantic saturation has the tendency to devalue the overall meaning of the word.   May I respectfully disagree? I do not honestly see the point of censoring words that we know are hurtful when discussing it in said ""neutral, describing-the-word"" (to borrow your phrase) context. From my point of view, asterisks in said contexts does not do anything other than to ""soften"" the word to fit white people's sensibilities and to not offend them because -- gasp! -- racism/sexism/whatever isn't dead!   After all, it's not as if people of color do not get called the full word by bigots on Reddit. I've gotten PMs calling me a number of slurs all the time. Racism is part of what I have to deal with on a regular basis, as a person of color. A friend of mine often gets messages and gets followed around and has slurs thrown at her on this website, and when she gets off of Reddit, she has to be reminded of the existence of racists, the KKK, of hate-related crimes and similar. Neither of us can turn this off and go back to white life, because we are not white. As such, I'd like to argue that using asterisks only blunts the force of bigotry for people who do not have to face this on a daily basis, and makes a mockery of what my friend and I have to deal with in our own daily lives."
FemmeThoughts,3bp8dk,keakealani,7,Wed Jul 1 03:34:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your perspective. For the record, I am not white and I also have personally been at the blunt end of racial slurs and hateful language about my race.   I think this is perhaps the point where different people have different perspectives, and no one solution will fit everyone's needs. To me, censoring a word does help me separate it out from the contexts of hate and abuse that I've experienced and that others I know and love have experienced. To me, it has nothing to do with white people's feelings, but a safety net for people who may share my perspective of desiring to keep at least a small distance away from the hurtful context of the word.   For you, and surely for others, this is not the case, so it seems unnecessary, and in fact you may attribute it to totally different reasons, like sparing white sensibility (and for the record, I'm sure that totally does happen, so I'm not saying that's a bad reason). I don't think that these two positions can be reconciled, but I humbly ask that you consider the diverse motivations behind these types of decisions and realize that they come from a place of good faith and, more importantly, because the people in question may be trying to seek closure or handle their feelings in the best way they know how."

FemmeThoughts,3bmrag,Adahn5,9,Tue Jun 30 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"I wish being healthy was emphasized more than being thin.   I wish attractiveness was more about how much you can lift, how fast you can run, how flexible you are, rather than how small your waist is."
FemmeThoughts,3bmrag,stripeygreenhat,12,Tue Jun 30 18:05:53 2015 UTC,I wish attractiveness was also linked to more than just your physical appearance. I've always found intelligence supremely sexy. The person I'm currently attracted to would not be attractive to me at all if she wasn't as intelligent as she is. Being able to hold a lengthy conversation about big issues is just as important to me as being able to talk about silly things like fluffy cats.

I think weightlifting should be discussed more in feminist circles. Literally feeling stronger makes me feel more like a strong, confident person. My confidence, my sense of strength, both contribute to and is fueled by my sense of feminism.   I guess what I'm trying to convey is that I think physical fitness could make women better feminists."
FemmeThoughts,3bmrag,RunAMuckGirl,5,Tue Jun 30 18:43:26 2015 UTC,"I agree too. I think there's quite a bit of stereotypical fear of becoming too buff or something if a woman were to lift weights.

FemmeThoughts,3bnl5h,jrl2014,16,Tue Jun 30 17:35:50 2015 UTC,"Some people see marriage as a reinforcement of heteronormative values, such as monogamy. While I believe that it should be a right afforded to everyone should they choose to partake, it is understandable that there are some folks out there with the idea of, ""well now everyone can get married so the lgbt community can settle down and be more like us, rather than being so flamboyant, etc"". These attitudes contribute to the erasure of gay culture and identity and the reinforcement of straightness as normal, just as the sentiment of ""oh well I like black people just fine when they act like white people/don't use slang/don't name their kids with strange names"" reinforces that whiteness is the default and the ideal.  There's also the idea that polyamorous relationships, as well as a whole slew of nontraditional types of relationships are still being excluded and not seen as valid life decisions."

FemmeThoughts,3bnl5h,sillandria,8,Tue Jun 30 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"I know that marriage used to be very sexist and unfair. But today I see marriage as an institution that mainly conveys privileges and is a contract regarding property/children.   This is the problem with modern feminism: that the appearance of equality is fostered by non-obvious factors rooted in historical context. Changing the institutions without changing any underlying intersubjective forces can only result in invisible oppression where the same power dynamics that created the overt oppression of the past still persist, but in covert ways. Marriage has a genealogy, one rooted in oppressive conceptions of gender. These conceptions haven't changed much, but have only been coaxed in different language and have been stripped of any overtly obvious sexism. But there is still the underlying compulsory heterosexuality that forces binary gender and submissive femininity onto women, toxic masculinity that promotes abusive relationships, and economic issues that punish women for trying to start a family--all of these have origins partly within the institution of marriage itself and are perpetuated in part by the continuation of marriage, even if marriage is a more inclusive institution now."

I'm A Trans Woman, And Gay Marriage Isn't Enough To Protect Me From These 7 Threats To My Health and Well-Being  Hope they help. And yes, feel secure in your understanding of it. It IS a reactionary institution that serves the status quo.   Marriage has always been about who is whose property (women, slaves, children) and who gets what property. Inheritance, employee benefits, insurance claims, taxation, wrongful death claims--all of the benefits associated with marriage are benefits that keep wealth in the hands of the wealthy. Those with no property are less likely to marry, and have less to protect using marriage law.  Today’s same-sex marriage advocates argue in courts and in the media that marriage is the bedrock of our society, that children need and deserve married parents, and that marriage is the most important relationship people can have. These arguments are the exact opposite of what feminist, anti-racist and anti-colonial movements have been saying for hundreds of years as they sought to dismantle state marriage because of its role in maldistributing life chances and controlling marginalized populations.   From the Smokestacks: Capitalism and Sexual Oppression  Rather than forcing gay people to act as heterosexuals, conform to a heteronormative expectation of what it is to be in a legitimate relationship, and assimilate their identities into that of a would-be heterosexual couple (which is bullshit( we should take the legal and financial benefits the union grants and make it readily available for all people who wish for them; separating the economic unit of ""marriage"" from the socio-cultural one.  We shouldn't be asking to join such an institution, no more than we should be asking to join the military. ""Oh yes, I want to go abroad and oppress other people, and kill them too!"" No we should be dismantling those horrible institutions and expanding the scope of human freedom. So that ALL love can be legitimate, and so that we stop oppressing people.

Many appear to have psychological issues, and the show even makes a plot point of misguided attempts to treat them (Healey plays at being a psychologist). A bunch of them are mothers of young children (almost all the hispanic characters, which is worth investigating as a stereotype). And the show definitely suggests that the justice system is failing a lot of these women, that the prison system is ineffective at rehabilitation.  I know the show's not ""realistic,"" but it does have a huge ensemble cast of mostly minority women, and describes many of the fundamental problems of the justice/prison system while also telling compelling (and/or funny) stories about the women in Lichfield."

They don't wear much makeup in OITNB.  Of course the main characters wear some - it's TV.  They're always going to try and even out skin tone on TV.  But it's usually pretty natural unless you have a character who's going to go out of their way to wear something special (like thick eyeliner).  Skin tone and eyebrows are really the only makeup that I can point at and say, ""Yeah, unrealistic.""  Everyone else who is clearly wearing some is someone who would have bought it from commissary and where having some makeup is very much a part of their character, like Sophia or Red.  Though I am curious which stills you saw that have heavy and ""glaringly obvious"" makeup.  I didn't see any in my search that I did for pictures, unless it's promo photos and those don't really count."

It must be so difficult cherry picking facts, launching preemptive strikes on your critics (""At the risk of having faecal matter posted through my letterbox...""), and smearing women in general.    I for one welcome the male birth control pill.  Will there be problems of course there will be.  Will it have side effects maybe?  Will religious groups oppose it?  Will abusive men lie about about being on the pill to father a child on a woman against her will?  Yes that may happen but we need to have laws and ways to deal with those situations.  That does not include banning a reproductive pill for men."

The pill won't make it worse, it'll just make being dubious about someone's claims that they can't cause a pregnancy a little less touchy. Now if someone says they're sterile and you're like eh, you're saying they're lying. Guy says he's on the pill, and you can be like yeah, well, it doesn't have a perfect efficacy, even if it's perfect use.  So in the respect of people lying about using it (or irresponsibly claiming to use it better than they do), I don't think it'll make things any worse than they are now. People of both sexes lie about their ability to reproduce in a permanent way on the regular as is."
FemmeThoughts,3b1zw0,flyingvenusflytrap,9,Sun Jul 5 09:53:23 2015 UTC,"I want to be a good feminist and I intend to follow through with the male birth control method (pill) because it's what an equal member of society should do.   It's both desirable and just that a man should offer to use methods that don't negatively impact the health of women, which includes assuming financial responsibility for contraception — especially when it's women who assume all the physical risk of pregnancy and have to deal with a massive amount of discrimination based on whether or not (should they decide to or not) go through with the act of becoming pregnant.  That includes social stigmas on whether to keep or abort, workplace discrimination based on prospective necessity for leave, and the possibility (and difficulty) or re-entering the workforce.  Contraception is also part of men's health. Men go to the doctor less than women do, and men's long-term health (especially if in a relationship, no matter if it's heterosexual or homosexual) impacts their partner too. If a man doesn't take care of himself, he's putting undue stress and burdens on his partner that are unfair."

FemmeThoughts,3b1zw0,kymmiijii,18,Thu Jun 25 19:05:23 2015 UTC,"I have no citation, but I remember reading that one of the reasons that the current forms of male birth control that are available in other areas of the world are not available in the west is due mainly to insurance companies. Vasalgel is cheep, easy, effective and permanent unless you want to reverse it... which is also cheep and easy. Couples switching to that form of birth control will stop using the female forms of birth control that require regular prescriptions. This means less money for insurance companies. It has nothing to do with women wanting to control men's fertility, and everything to do with insurance companies wanting to protect their profits.   As far as how I handle feminism being misrepresented, the only thing I can do is be myself, initiate respectful conversations, and continue to point out the need for feminism both in the US and around the world. Here on Reddit, I'm a part of thebluepill which helps me laugh about the problem as well as think about ways to change it. It helps to have a space where you know that everyone supports equal rights for everyone, regardless of their gender, gender identification, sexual preference, race... etc..."
FemmeThoughts,3b1zw0,breadfollowsme,11,Thu Jun 25 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"What? How could people possibly conclude feminists don't like male contraception? That's been one of the sticking points of feminism, that birth control is always put on the woman as her responsibility and when she gets pregnant the baby becomes her burden.  Please, men, start using BC. Even if I'm already using BC as well. Let's make double sure not to have a baby. Let's get rid of this whole idea that all women are out to trap some baby daddies. Ugh."
FemmeThoughts,3b1zw0,MarthaGail,10,Thu Jun 25 18:50:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to deal with it, to be honest. When I was teaching my child and their peers about sexual health and responsibility I emphasized over and over that each person in a sexual encounter was individually responsible to give and receive consent, and to use some method of birth/std control - one method per person, never one method per encounter. The smaller range of options for males was discussed a lot, and I've never met a person who was actively against it other than those who were against all contraception on principle.   I think that some of this supposed opposition has been drawn from statements made by some women that they wouldn't be okay with using only a male BCP for contraception, because of the feeling that since women are the ones getting pregnant they are going to have much higher trust hurdles to cross before engaging in intercourse. That is a long way from being opposed to new methods of male contraception but I think it is occasionally seized upon and distorted in order to advance a different agenda."
FemmeThoughts,3b1zw0,P_Grammicus,8,Thu Jun 25 19:04:56 2015 UTC,"As a woman, I honestly prefer a male birth control pill to a female one - firstly, in an admittedly quite malicious way, to me it's ""payback"" for all the decades women have had their hormonal cycles fucked with. (I am currently suffering from a low sex drive as a result of birth control which I stopped taking TWO MONTHS AGO, so I think I take this more personally than I should.)  But most importantly, because of the asymmetric nature of birth (the person with the uterus must deliver the child), having birth control available to the person with the testicles means that if they are lying about it, the person with the uterus has the option of aborting the pregnancy; at the moment the RP douches are all talking about spermjacking and wanting to be able to have a financial abortion, etc. With male birth control, for couples who use it, it gives the person who is 'betrayed' by a lying spouse a way to escape the situation."

FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,itsalreadybeenthrown,29,Thu Jun 25 03:15:11 2015 UTC,"It's the equivalent of a white person saying ""I don't see race"". Potentially well intentioned, but it's basically a person willfully ignoring that racial disparities exist (both in blatantly obvious racism, and in nuanced common sense racism), and assuming (at least on a practical level) that everything is equal, or equal enough to not worry about any of that...and being able to hold that ideological position (and feel comfortable/confident in its truth) because white privilege keeps race from being a personal everyday obstacle for them. or perhaps the person is willing to recognize there are racial disparities in society, but feels that saying they ""don't see race"", and ignoring the personal influences of race on people's lives, experiences, etc. absolves them from all the social harms being done.   Fact is, people are treated differently due to race, and we need to acknowledge these specific differences in order to address them, not throw around universal feel good statements that don't address anything but vague hate. I mean, if there's a neighbourhood dealing with a serial killer murdering neighbour after neighbour, we try to find the serial killer. We don't tell the victims of the serial killer to focus on all murders (or perhaps ore accurately, all deaths) instead. If there's a hurricane coming up the east coast of the USA, we send warnings and updates through the media on that storm to help people be aware of what's going on, and alert them about ways to keep safe...we don't petition for news broadcasters to split the hurricane's screentime with a mild rainstorm in Ohio, or a gentle snowfall in Canada's maritime provinces because all storms are important. Clearly, the hurricane takes priority, because it's vastly more likely to be deadly, and lives along the eastern seaboard are more likely to be at risk.  So when folks say black lives matter, that's because historically and currently that is not the way things truly are in society. It is not the way society sees it, not deep down, within institutions that have great social power. This must be addressed, because in truth, all lives matter, but black people in the USA just aren't thought of that way, and that needs to be rectified"

All lives clearly don't matter in the United States, for instance, where the life of a white cop matters so much more than the life of an African-American person.  In the face of that, the empty generality “all lives matter” is actively obscuring what is in fact going on, and some lives don't require the kind of special attention that Black Lives require right now. If a house is burning and one is fine, you tend to the one that's burning to the ground.  AllLivesMatter is an attempt to to co-opt and subsume #BlackLivesMatter into what is ultimately pro-white, pro-status quo derailment.  Here's an interesting blog post on the subject."

FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,lockedge,2,Thu Jun 25 16:19:53 2015 UTC,"Can you point me to an explanation of universalism?   It's among the values of liberalism, such as meliorism, individualism, free speech, etc. Universalism generally adheres to the notion, in defining the specificity of different groups of people, people's similarities as individuals supersede their group-specific differences. It hides behind a veil of complete human unity and solidarity, but in actuality seeks to atomize patterns in problematic behaviour, systemic oppression and economic exploitation and bury it beneath a blanket denial of these when they affect disenfranchised or disempowered minorities, whether these be ethnic, gender, sexual and so on.  Universalism seeks to create legal, or otherwise constitutional equality, rather than emancipation for those who would need those protections.  Anyway I recommend The Arc of the Moral Universe and Other Essays:   Liberal political thought has always been self-consciously universalistic, speaking in the name of all human beings, and urging the protection of the rights and interests of all, regardless of race, class, gender, religion, or any other of the particularisms that distinguish and divide us.  But critics of liberalism have vigilantly revealed the hidden (and not-so-hidden) exclusions—of, for example, class, race, and gender—that compromise liberalism's defining promise: its capacity so say ""all"" without quite meaning it. Some critics have argued that its promise is essentially compromised.  For them, liberal universalism is unavoidably exclusive, its fundamental categories, such as citizens, person, public, and rights, cannot be extended to include all people without losing their definition. These critics argue, for example, that the idea of a public sphere takes shape from its opposition to a private sphere and that the distinction between public and private stands in the way of equality for women; or that the abstractions that define liberal universalism require that we neglect the more concrete differences—such as class and natural endowment—that shape actual liberals.  Liberals, of course, deny that the project of liberal universalism is hopelessly compromise and that abstraction is the enemy of equality and inclusion. But denial is one thing, it is quite another to make a constructive case that liberalism can deliver more fully on the universalistic promise of its classical proponents and to abandon key elements of liberalism to ensure that delivery.   This in page 177-8 of that book, chapter ""Reflections of on the Democratic Tradition"".  Edit: Spellcheck :3"
FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,Adahn5,2,Thu Jun 25 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"Great explanation!  Another one I have found is in the essay  ""White Fragility"" that you can read here: http://libjournal.uncg.edu/index.php/ijcp/article/view/249/116  It's slightly less on topic, because it addresses whiteness as a whole, not white supremacy in feminism, but still relevant in my opinion.  ""Whites are taught to see their perspectives as objective and repres tentative of reality (McIntosh, 1988). The belief in objectivity, coupled with positioning white people as outside of culture (and thus the norm for humanity), allows whites to view themselves as universal humans who can represent all of human experience. This is evidenced through an unracialized identity or location, which functions as a kind of blindness; an inability to think about Whiteness as an identity or as a “state” of being that would or could have an impact on one’s life. In this position, Whiteness is not recognized or named by white people, and a universal reference point is assumed. White people are just people. Within this construction, whites can represent humanity, while people of color, who are never just people but always most particularly black people, Asian people, etc., can only represent their own racialized experiences (Dyer, 1992)."""

But everyone I've ever met who spouts this nonsense is either using it to imply that the time for feminism is over (""like, I get the suffrage movement, but what are you complaining about now?  You must just be looking for special treatment) or these are that special kind of ""male feminist"" who's really just in it for his own gain (recently a guy tried to tell me that men had it harder in the 50's due to sexism because they had to deal with class struggle.  Like for real?  Lower and middle class women had to work and deal with class-ism, as well)."
FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,fraulien_buzz_kill,3,Fri Jun 26 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"harder in the 50's due to sexism because they had to deal with class struggle   Sounds like a Brocialist.  But yes, people claiming to be egalitarian usually use it as a way of telling off Feminists when they think they've gone ""too far""—a subjective notion that basically applies to whatever is inconveniencing their privilege."
FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,Adahn5,12,Fri Jun 26 23:00:33 2015 UTC,"Ladies, why are you downvoting this comment? I have no idea what it means either, but am I right in thinking it was a comeback to the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement?"
FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,kochipoik,24,Thu Jun 25 07:20:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was a purposeful pushback against #blacklivesmatter and in that context it is offensive. I think if #alllivesmatter had popped up on its own, emphasizing that every life is important, it wouldn't be so bad (though it still plays on the ""we're all in this together!"" trope, ignoring how large and important of an impact race can have, but still I think if it came about out of context we might be a smidge happier). However, it was a response to black lives matter, basically saying, ""no, all lives matter! Let's not drag race into this [clearly racially pertinent] issue!"" It's a silencing of black voices and a dismissal of the real violence and oppression that PoC still face, all in the name of being ""color blind,"" and that's why it's an issue. So yep, you've got it! And yeah the downvotes are uncalled for; you don't have to upvote, but asking for clarification is not counterproductive to discussion (at least not in you'd format on a discussion board with comments that allow for sub-discussion; I do think that comments like that in other contexts are derailing and can be frustrating)."
FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,onlykindagreen,4,Thu Jun 25 08:54:35 2015 UTC,"It may be different for me because I'm not in the USA (and while we do have racism in NZ, it's not even close to what it's like in the USA), but this whole thing seems utterly ridiculous. That people would deny there being a problem, that is - those arguments in the article are almost identical to what people say to dismiss feminism. ""Don't be so sensitive"", ""Not all men"", etc.   How could you possibly deny that race is not involved in this, that POC have it worse in almost every way, and ignoring that is just as bad (if not worse) than not doing anything for feminism at all?  And the ""colour blind"" thing? Ugh. Firstly, it does seem like a kind of forced assimilation. And it's just so... dismissive? That because I'm not racist, I can't understand that you've been affected by racism.  Hopefully I'm articulating myself well - it's late and cold and I should be in bed but I'm reading Luminosity (a much better written Twilight fanfiction)."
FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,kochipoik,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:47:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the explanation.  I wasn't actually aware of the context of ""#alllivesmatter"" and thought it was something that popped up on its own, or possibly that it was a result of a variety of tags like maybe ""Hispaniclivesmatter"" or ""Womenslivesmatter"" or something coming under an umbrella term.  No real reason for me to have thought that aside from my own assumptions.    Again, thanks for the explanation."
FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,IfWishezWereFishez,-2,Thu Jun 25 17:14:25 2015 UTC,"Because the answer is a very quick Google search away, likely. There's no ban on asking to be educated here, but the community generally expects all of us to attempt to answer our own questions prior to requesting that of the group.  TL;DR: Probably because it doesn't follow community norms."
FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,Shmaesh,21,Thu Jun 25 14:12:00 2015 UTC,It's kind of mind biggling to me that people who are feminists literally fall into the same behaviors about race as patriarchal men do about gender. Like.... how do they not realize?
FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,ChicagoRunner,19,Thu Jun 25 12:42:46 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it's very easy for white people in general to be unaware and uninformed about racism, because since it doesn't personally affect them they have the option of ignoring it. It doesn't take much digging to find out what issues POC (especially WOC) are facing every day, though, so there's no real excuse other than a lack of empathy or caring about the lives of oppressed racial minorities.  It is indeed very sad though when white feminists ignore or dismiss racial issues, considering they themselves are clearly aware of the consequences of oppression and should be eager to stomp it out in all of its forms. Being a white ally is something I take pride in and I only hope more white feminists take the initiative to stand up beside their sisters of color as well."

I hadn't realized the literally night and day difference between the life experience of a middle class white woman and a black woman of any socio-economic background, and that's not even getting into transgendered women's experiences.  It's really a disservice to any modern civil rights movement to not be intersectional in 2015."

It's the most logical, or maybe intelligent (?) way to approach any social injustice. I think people who dismiss intersectionality simply find it too overwhelming to admit all axes of oppression and privilege into the conversation, but that really comes down to lazy thinking and lack of empathy. Of course it's good and often necessary to focus on a particular issue at a given point in time, but progress needs to be open and available to everyone. For instance, we have an epidemic of black men, particularly young black men, being killed by law enforcement in this country. That deserves all the attention it's receiving and more! But the black women who have also been murdered by those assigned to ""serve and protect"" get lost in the conversation all too often, which I think is unfortunate edit: and beyond unfortunate, lethal. Especially since black women spearheaded #BlackLivesMatter."

FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,EbilSmurfs,21,Thu Jun 25 09:54:05 2015 UTC,"Could someone please explain this quote? I feel like I'm missing some context here.   For instance, pro-choice campaigns have worthy goals of increasing access to abortion care. But Margaret Sanger, called the founder of the birth control movement, also advocated for eugenics, a racist ideology focused on wiping out people of color.   Ok, this I do understand; I was a bit confused at first since there isn't a direct correlation between the general want of access to birth control and a particular individual with reprehensible policies in how to use said access. And, someone who idolizes a person who advocated for such reprehensible policies is at least someone who is missing critical analysis skills.  But then this statement:   Many leading pro-choice advocates won’t acknowledge this awful history or address the impact it still has today – like forced sterilization of Black women. Instead, they’ve lead a movement that hurts many of the people relying on reproductive justice.   Again, the first sentence makes sense; we should acknowledge that in the history of gaining access to birth control, horrible things have happened to black women as a result of white women. This is indisputable.   What I would like explained is how supporting the current pro-choice movement is hurting the people relying on reproductive justice.  It just feels like she's missing a step. Surely the ugly history of the pro-choice movement doesn't negate the good it does now, and if the current movement still abnegates women of color, she should have cited how.  P.S. I'm not trying to troll or anything. If there are instances where the current pro-choice movement has harmed women of color, please let me know."

FemmeThoughts,3b0fdt,sugarblossom_,12,Fri Jun 26 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"Look, here's a bunch of other stuff Sanger said that took me five minutes to find:   She even presented at a Ku Klux Klan rally in 1926 in Silver Lake, N.J. She recounted this event in her autobiography: “I accepted an invitation to talk to the women’s branch of the Ku Klux Klan … I saw through the door dim figures parading with banners and illuminated crosses … I was escorted to the platform, was introduced, and began to speak … In the end, through simple illustrations I believed I had accomplished my purpose. A dozen invitations to speak to similar groups were proffered” (Margaret Sanger, “An Autobiography,” Page 366). That she generated enthusiasm among some of America’s leading racists says something about the content and tone of her remarks.  In a letter to Clarence Gable in 1939, Sanger wrote: “We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members” (Margaret Sanger commenting on the ‘Negro Project’ in a letter to Gamble, Dec. 10, 1939).   Sauce  I don't like the author of this article, or her agenda, but it doesn't change the lasting narrative that's out there on Sanger. It likely twists her words, and misrepresents her intent. But that is how Sanger is actually remembered in a lot of communities.  There is a problem with how Sanger is remembered (rightly or not, though I lean towards mostly rightly. Eugenics is fucked. Period.) by communities of color. The way to address that is not to hand-wave about the definition of words and move on. The perception is real, it's divisive within feminism and it needs to be faced head on. As the article exhorts us to do.  I'm leaving your comment removed, as it's an attempt to start a derail.

They used saving the kids as a pretext for Claire's character growth. The talking down was poorly executed set up of Claire's character.

The comment that the kids have been ""foisted"" on her is strange as well, because I actually interpreted the idea as being that she was supposed to not be working for the week, not that she's been forced to juggle the kids and her job.   That being said, I do agree with the comments about the idea that she's supposed to have kids and being talked down to by her male coworkers.

I agree with her on pictures.  Literally hundreds were taken of my daughter.  I think over 400.  I took some, my husband took some, there was a nurse in the OR taking pictures for us, and my midwife did too, and of course we had Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep.  I will say that the L&D staff at my hospital were pretty fantastic.  I went in thinking my daughter had probably passed, because she hadn't moved at all the day labor started, and the triage nurse was so sweet and thorough.  She actually went and stayed with me to be my nurse the whole time.  (Usually you get checked out in triage and then someone else is assigned to you when you get to your room.)  Even when we went to the OR.  And they bent their no photography rules for us.  They let the whole family come back into the post-surgery recovery area when she was still alive to meet her, and kept me a room in L&D in case someone else needed to be in recovery, so I wouldn't have to be on the other side of the curtain from someone with a live baby.    They put me away from the maternity floor, for which I was grateful, though I gather some other parents don't like being moved away.  I couldn't have taken the sound of the babies.  Of course, the down side to being on the med/surg floor was the nurses there didn't know what the hell to do with me, and there is a higher patient/nurse ratio there.  At least one nurse seemed afraid of me.  But that might have been the dead baby in the room thing, because I kept her with me almost the whole time I was there.  And actually, this is the part of her story that really angers me:   She took the baby and put him on this metal, cold-looking roller. Then she put a white sheet over him. It just seemed wrong — they could carry the baby out in their arms. I remember him vibrating on that cart, bumping up and down as she wheeled him out. Not a good moment.   I don't know or really care what they did when out of my sight, but whenever Psalm was around me the nurses treated her with dignity.  She was wrapped up in blankets and placed in a bassinet just like any other baby.  She was held by the nurses just like a living baby.  She was touched gently and respectfully.  There's no reason not to treat a dead baby similarly to a living one in front of their parents.  It doesn't take any extra effort to be kind."

FemmeThoughts,3au7vx,Grave_Girl,2,Tue Jun 23 23:07:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, dang.  I didn't realize that, since it seemed to have the same title.  It seems as though the NYT is doing a series on the subject of stillbirth; I saw a request for stories posted to Facebook shortly after sharing the link.  I think it's a worthwhile thing.  Until you are there, you don't realize just how many people have gone through the same thing.  Stillbirth and neonatal loss are terrible things to go through, but it's somehow comforting to realize you're not alone.  There are always tons of stories whenever the subject arises on Reddit.  (And yes, there's a sub for that: /r/babyloss )"
FemmeThoughts,3au7vx,Grave_Girl,2,Wed Jun 24 01:24:53 2015 UTC,"I believe you're right. They're doing a general series about reproduction (the abortion doula story I posted the other day comes from the same series), and I imagine the stories come from that call.   I also imagine that it does help to know you're not alone. We think of birth as being a relatively safe thing with all the advances in modern medicine, but things do go wrong. We don't hear about them, but they're there, and sometimes, it can be good to be reminded that it's not your fault, or that things do go wrong. I'm glad the sub exists, and I'm glad stories like this can help women who do go through something like this, especially considering how utterly traumatic it can be.   While it wasn't a stillbirth, my sister had a miscarriage about a year ago. It broke her so much, even though she had a healthy baby afterwards. She thought of it as her fault, and wondered if she could have done anything different. I hated watching her go through that, and I wonder if knowing that she's not alone would have helped in some way."
FemmeThoughts,3au7vx,thisisforsubs,2,Wed Jun 24 01:30:03 2015 UTC,"Miscarriage is a separate terrible thing, because we're taught that it shouldn't be a big deal, especially if it's early.  I don't think there's any escape from ""There was probably something wrong with it"", as though that somehow makes it better.    Any sort of reproductive loss is such a blow to your sense of self, because you've failed to do something that it seems literally every other person on the planet can do.

FemmeThoughts,3as1bv,Shmaesh,7,Tue Jun 23 01:23:04 2015 UTC,"When contemporary black feminists critique white feminists for failing to recognize, interrogate, and cede their own racial privilege, that complaint is rooted in history.   This concept has been bothering me a lot with all the racial discussions going on recently.  How? I grew up with in a family that professed to be the post-racial, ""I don't see race"" type. But when I started dating a black boy at fourteen, I was told that dating him was fine, but I could never introduce him to my grandfather-since he believed that black men could only be successful in sports or entertainment.  Since I don't want to be racist-and recognize that I am at least as much as all white people are-I've been reading all the news and opinion pieces I can get my hands on with the goal of raising my daughter in a more open-minded manner. So, I understand the concept of, and have been actively trying to, recognize my privilege. Interrogating my privilege is harder, since questioning the value of it in the moment, day-to-day is difficult; especially in a low-diversity area. But how do we actively cede our privilege? I could see how this concept works on the macro-level, but what, specific, day-to-day actions can white (people! in general, but specifically) women do to cede our privilege?  Maybe it's the quality of information I've been reading, but all I've seen speaks to being aware of and acknowledging privilege, but doesn't have active behaviors to implement.  Now, I say this as a person who actively told off my FIL for using the n-word in my presence, saying I did not want any children of mine exposed to that kind of vitriol and he'd better get into the habit of checking himself (this was before I had my daughter). I also told him his prejudice was driving away his daughter (my sil), (who was dating a black man). He took my scolding to heart, because sil's bf came by a few months ago to get fil's blessing for their engagement, he gave it, and is now helping them plan their wedding.  But, these behaviors can't be it, right? People have been scolding racist relatives for forever; there has to be more we can do, right?"
FemmeThoughts,3as1bv,JessthePest,11,Tue Jun 23 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"This article is really interesting. I'm wondering, though, how one refuses to be an ""excuse"" for racism. I always try to quell racist comments and actions where I see them, but the concept of white womanhood is so ingrained in our culture, it will be difficult to dismantle. For the most part, it seems like ""white womanhood"" is something white men have made up, and it seems like many white women don't really take part in it (men, too, to be honest). However, I might be very, very, very wrong. Maybe most white women participate in it without realizing, and that's part of the question of how to go about dismantling it. I don't want to be an excuse for racist violence either. But I'm not sure how to fix it, since it seems to be a concept about me, outside of me, rather than a concept that's in my control."
FemmeThoughts,3as1bv,nihilofit,16,Tue Jun 23 06:54:37 2015 UTC,"I think this one passage sort of sums it up:  ""f anything, the powerlessness we feel as a result of sexism too often urges us to hold on to, and exert over others, what remaining power we have. For white women, that means the power gifted to us by the color of our skin. Few white women resisted lynching in the early 20th century. A gendered and raced pedestal isn’t always comfortable to stand on, but it comes with a lot of perks and not a small amount of power. When contemporary black feminists critique white feminists for failing to recognize, interrogate, and cede their own racial privilege, that complaint is rooted in history.""  Basically, I think she's saying that white women have participated in racist acts, and benefited from them, and now need to work on actively confronting racism and actively giving up white privilege.  This is difficult to do because of course, we (as a group, not necessarily you and I) want to hold on to our white power less we be deprived of what power we have.  Actions might include using our own ""white femaleness"" to be more active in addressing racism by men, refuse to condone racism from other white women, and be political allies for black people, etc.  I think her first analogy, using Dylan Roof, was poignant but slightly confusing.  This white man used of the protection of white women as an excuse to paint himself as a hero for acts of terrorism.  It's hard to make the connection between his acts and active white female participation in the act, but it's certainly there, it just requires deeper digging.  I don't think she's saying that white women were entirely responsible for this act, and if she is, I disagree- if, in his mind, white women weren't worth ""protecting"" I'm sure he would have found some other reason to do it, and while white men talk about protecting white women, they also rape, murder, abuse, and silence them.    BUT I do think she is calling on white women to recognize our complicity, silence, and active aggression on matters of race."
FemmeThoughts,3as1bv,fraulien_buzz_kill,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:12:48 2015 UTC,"I mean though, with the Charleston shooter, it becomes pretty clear that he's the type of racist who would disdain women for ever having sex with a man of color. I think that's clearly a misogynistic desire to control women's bodies that women have clearly been fighting against.   I think the actual connection between what he was saying and white complicity lies in a media that always talks about black criminality.   [Anecdote time: I grew up three hours away from Chicago, and my Dad says he was jarred when we first moved here because of all the local news reporting on young black men (who's sketches all looked the same) committing crimes three hours away.]   That is, I don't think women have any special complicity in this."
FemmeThoughts,3as1bv,jrl2014,4,Tue Jun 23 14:29:31 2015 UTC,"I think we're pretty much in agreement about the Charleston shooter and women having, and you eloquently put it, no ""special complicity.""  I mean, the idea that he's protecting white women is obviously false, because black men are not really a threat to white women.  It's a racist fabrication, a false enemy, create to make white men feel like heroes.  This line of reasoning is used all the time- Christians like to pretend that abuse of women is a Muslim problem in order to criminalize them, Americans like to pretend abuse of women is a middle eastern problem in order to justifying ""introducing democracy.""  The ""protect the women"" ideology is used by aggressive groups in many situations to justify their violent acts, prejudice, and state terrorism.  So, then, the defense of women doesn't particularly serve women, but instead serves men/dominant groups, and white women aren't really responsible for creating.  But we may have a special ability to defeat it.  I think the example is used in order to begin talking about a different issue- it's an abstract jump in reasoning, rather than a concrete one. She uses his ideology to illustrate the central role that white women play in a certain destructive ideology, and then jumps to how we might contribute to this, and might possibly refute this.  I think white feminists (which I would like to just clarify, I am one of) and white women at large often don't address issues of racism which are perpetuated by white women, and certainly don't take advantage of our own privilege to destroy white supremacy.   Now, I do think that the media is also hugely responsible for this.  I don't mean to excuse them,  I just think that white women as a group need to mobilize against racism.  Some of them already do- probably not enough.  I'll offer my own anecdote: where I live, in the Northeastern US in a very liberal area, white women still often behave with fear around black men, and pretty openly speak about this.  White male behavior, even when poor, is often accepted as normal while black male behavior is interpreted as being overly aggressive or trashy.  Make no mistake: these things are perpetrated by white men, but also by white women.  I think, within our own circles, we need to be critical of it, as well as use our standing to address it where it comes from white men."
FemmeThoughts,3as1bv,fraulien_buzz_kill,2,Tue Jun 23 22:11:38 2015 UTC,I really liked your point about how because we're implicated in the reasoning there's hope that we have a special ability to fight against it.

Racist white men - use white women as an excuse, calling them 'our women' like only the rapes of white women matter.    Like the Charleston shooter who didn't know, or care that black women are raped at a higher rate.    Donald Trump claiming that Mexican men come to the US the rape white women, ignoring the thousands of Mexican women and girls who are kidnapped and trafficked, often into the US who are used by white men.

While on an individual level we can be against racism, it is so incredibly important to realize where we fit in on the larger scale.

FemmeThoughts,3as1bv,Grape1921,3,Tue Jun 23 20:28:57 2015 UTC,"Sometimes getting people to notice oppressive norms, knowledge, expectations, action, etc. is quite helpful. Far too many people believe racism consists of only the absolutely blatant acts, rather that the far more common things like, say...how western understandings of beauty are entirely tied up in racism and notions of white purity. Most people I know have a difficult time getting or digesting that fact, and sometimes get defensive over it. It's getting people to challenge things that they take for granted as true, ordinary, and fair as what they are, whether they be racist, sexist, etc.   It's helping engage people on these issues, helping people recognize the difference in how white women are seen in western society, and how women of colour are seen in western society. Whether it's things like purity culture, to how the media and society treat darker skinned children as more mature/adult-like, etc. it's all quite important to get people to acknowledge difference. That we're past the 2nd wave of feminism era where 'womanhood' was something people thought was real (as in, a  universal kind), and that the ""I don't see race"" perspective is still very much racist as it ignores the racist oppression and is an attempt to disconnect oneself from the racist history and present state of western society, all while still taking advantage of the privilege bestowed upon them."

I'm a white woman and I would say I'm not complacent in racial violence against black people because I talk about it at every chance I can get to other white people, and now actively avoid media that promotes or otherwise doesn't condemn racial violence or exclusion. This can mean anything from not paying for movies or music with racist content to boycotting tv shows and video games that don't have any black characters in them.  It's not hard to be an active ally, but it does take constant awareness and the willingness to evaluate my own thoughts and actions as I educate myself on racism as told by the lived experiences of POC (and especially WOC)."

FemmeThoughts,3apx8u,Wyboth,2,Mon Jun 22 15:31:40 2015 UTC,I thought it was Islamophobia?
FemmeThoughts,3apx8u,ThatSpazChick,11,Mon Jun 22 19:09:33 2015 UTC,"It is what we say it is, these are all human categories and constructs.  The author is trying to address a problem.  She sees/hears people justify their prejudice as being okay because ""its not racism because Muslim's aren't a race.""  So the author then looks for a solution to this problem.  The solution she chose was to say it is in fact racism, and then she supports that argument by saying that racism is no longer about genetics.  Racist people no longer argue that poverty and inequality stem from genetic/biological differences, but instead reside within the culture.  For example, black musicians often get labeled as poor examples, which lead African American astray, or that Black people don't place the same emphasis on family, so their fathers leave the children, and growing up without a father figure leaves them prone to lacking direction, and entering a life of crime.  These racial arguments place the blame on the victims, racial minorities.  So basically the author says that Race is now more about culture, and that Muslims are a cultural group, and therefore prejudice or Islamophobia can be classified as racism.  So the author has solved her problem (people trying to make themselves feel better about their prejudices) by arguing that the definition of race has changed from being more focused on genetics to being more focused on Culture.  I agree with her argument, I just think that the result that it hopes to achieve is imperfect.   I think personally there is a better solution.  We already have a less problematic concept for cultural groupings, its called Ethnicity.  I'm not arguing it isn't problematic, or that terrible violence and abuse haven't been carried out in the name of ethnicity, but we can at least back up ethnicity as a legitimate concept.  There are groups of people with common ancestry and culture who often share certain genetic linkage and will often choose to identify with that group.  And that's a very important distinction, racial grouping of people don't have to have the people within in the group identify with each other.  Because the most prevalent use of the word race in recent memory is of biological significance, it has in essence from the start of modern history been a false concept.  Trying now to shape it into something workable is a fools errand.  Instead we should discuss it, and it's continued and past consequences, for what they are, prejudice based upon a false grouping of people.  And from there we need to make sure that people understand that all prejudice, based upon Race, Culture, Gender, Ethnicity, or anything for that matter, is very very wrong.  Racism is too often seen as the ""worst thing"" that you can partake in, when in my mind sexism is just as bad, when Islamophobia is just as bad, when antisemitism is just as bad.  We have one word that describes all of these harmful and down right stupid ideologies, and that word is prejudice.  I hope that one day prejudice carries the weight it should, so that we don't have to keep shaping such a broken term as racism to fit the horrible acts of others.  For now, I accept the argument of the author.  In my mind using ""racism/racist"" is worth it if we can make sure that other's are unable to dismiss their prejudice simply by saying a particular term isn't applicable.  But in a perfect world we would just use the word prejudice.  I guess my problem boils down to the fact that the fix that she has concieved is one that revolves around the terms, rather than around the act.  The people are still bad because ""Yes, you are still a racist.""  Rather than, ""Call it what you want, you are a Bigot."""

So what I tend to talk about are things that are relevant and easy to think about for the audience. With your brother, has he ever felt like he was pressured to hide his feelings around other guys or act extra manly to not be considered a ""fag""? This is an example of how gender roles can oppress men. Has he ever felt like the school system or someone at work was being unfair to him for being a guy? A lot of times it can work against women as well. Like the whole issue of ""women's skirts being too low and they're 'distracting' to men at school."" Doesn't this seem like it infantalizes guys for not having enough control? Then you can point out how our society tends to have this underlying assumption that (white) men hold power, and we need to make every effort to keep men from losing it somehow. Yet this notion ends up leading to some ridiculous assumptions - like guys shouldn't show any ""weak"" emotions or guys can't be around girls who could ""make"" them lose control.  I don't know if that's helpful at all - like I said I'm still struggling with how to explain these concepts as well. I certainly welcome critique or other ideas from the other ladies here."
FemmeThoughts,3ajyb7,algernonwaits,26,Sun Jun 21 03:36:02 2015 UTC,I would start by asking him to define patriarchy. Often his issue stems from people having vastly different operating definitions (see: rape culture)
FemmeThoughts,3ajyb7,foreverburning,17,Sun Jun 21 06:27:32 2015 UTC,"Why does he think it's such a ridiculous thing to believe? Does he fall for the tired misconception that the patriarchy is actually some secret cabal of men? Or even the idea that it's all men consciously setting out to subjugate women (of which there are undeniably some, but they wouldn't be enabled if it weren't for the far larger system of social values that privilege men)?"
FemmeThoughts,3ajyb7,Glass_Underfoot,12,Sun Jun 21 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"I have actually never met a man in person who thinks the patriarchy exists, although it could be because it isn't really a topic of conversation?  :/ I hope that most people realize that it exists but I don't really know."

FemmeThoughts,3ajyb7,EarWorm,3,Sat Jun 27 23:29:41 2015 UTC,"So I want to say that it's been a really good exercise for me to think about why it is that men, especially young men, have a hard time recognizing that patriarchy is a key component of our power structures. I don't intend for any of these to be excuses, but examples of the obstacles that males face when they're developing their worldview. If anyone disagrees with any of this, I'd love to hear about it. I'd also like to add that what I'm saying comes from a white male perspective and may not be as applicable to people of color.  Young men see themselves as lacking power. They have no control over the advantages it gives them, as these advantages are systemic. To admit that it's an advantage (which other people don't have) calls into question whether or not they deserve it. Until a person leaves home, they are often almost completely lacking in agency. Nearly everyone has power over them. Even retail employees (the lowest in the hierarchy of almost any culture that has retail) often pull power trips on them (as well as on females of the same age). Having recently gotten out of that position, it can be difficult to recognize that their culture has already begun giving them advantages not given to women and POC.   As ridiculous as it sounds, they also often feel that they are unable to dominate females in the manner that they want/fantasize about. Many young men, especially those drawn toward Pickup Artist type... um... bullshit are threatened by female sexual agency. If they can't use patriarchy to their advantage for the thing they think about more than anything (sex), they believe it must not exist. This applies to anything that they would like to exert power over but are unable.  Religion is also a big factor for a lot of males. Patriarchy is generally taught in christianity as a matter of course. When I was growing up, they explained patriarchy perfectly in church, and later I had no trouble recognizing it when it was explained to me. The only thing that was new about it when my feminist friends explained it to me was the label, ""patriarchy."" If a person is raised in a fundamentalist church, they're taught that the Bible is literal (except of for the parts that their church leaders want to be allegorical). To question it is to literally question the state of your soul and your life after death. For me, this was a huge help in shedding christianity altogether. If you want to emerge on the other side with your fundamentalist faith intact, it's a difficult process.  I believe class is also a huge factor, but I have to admit that I grew up in a fairly middle-class home. My understanding is second-hand, and the reality is far more complex than can understand. People below or near the poverty line often had mothers absolutely busted ass to keep the family physically intact. Their children saw their function as absolutely necessary because the mother was life saving. It's likely easy for people who grow up in this situation to see the gender divide as a necessary thing. I could make a lot of hypotheses about upper class homes, like a father that brings in the money appears to have a less enviable position than a mother with a lot of free time. Or if it's an upper-class home and both parents work long hours, they could look fairly equal to their children. I grew up in a house with four kids and my dad was a welder. Really, I'd just be making stuff up.   I think it's important to remember that everyone sees the world as having power divides, it's simply a matter of where we see those power divides lying. And the thing is, many of these viewpoints aren't wrong, just incomplete. Most people can see that having more money gives more power. I'll bet your brother sees that. People who pay attention to current events can see that white people have more power, or at the very least, have less power taken from them. Straight people, even taking marriage equality into account, have more power. Men certainly have more power.   If I were trying to get someone to recognize patriarchy for what it is (and I have a 3 year old son, so I am, but slowly), I would engage them in conversations about inequality in general. They certainly see inequality, so where do they see it? And if it was family, I would make it a long term goal. I also think mothers have the greatest ability to make their sons recognize patriarchy (and fathers are a close second). In general I think that people have to come to recognize it in their own way. Everyone has their own personal defenses, their own reasons for not wanting to recognize it. The one experience that could wake most men up, I think, is a conversation with their mother about an injustice that she's experienced and an explanation about how it's not an abnormal thing. A conversation with their father about an injustice he's seen, an an explanation about how it's not an abnormal thing could do it too, but it wouldn't have create the same visceral reaction. So I guess the easiest answer I can give you is to get your mom in on it if you can. If I were trying to do that, I'd probably get my mom talking about her view of injustice, her personal experiences and go from there.  I hope this, and the other suggestions that people have given helps. Cheers."

FemmeThoughts,3ajyb7,chakrablocker,22,Sun Jun 21 05:50:51 2015 UTC,"Literally the first definition that shows up on Google:  ""Patriarchy is a social system in which males hold primary power, predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property; in the domain of the family, fathers or father-figures hold authority over women and children.""  Look at your congress, list of presidents, list of influential people in your region (socially or economically). All mostly men, the further back you go the more there are. See how many people still refer to men as 'heads of family', how many people think women's bodies are owned by their spouse or boyfriend.  Sounds pretty real to me.  Patriarchy isn't ""there's an Illuminati-level conspiracy of men to keep women down"", it's the devaluation and abasement of women (and uplifting of men) as a societal backdrop that frames everything within it."

FemmeThoughts,3ajyb7,cacotechny,15,Sun Jun 21 08:33:08 2015 UTC,"I would definitely say try to figure out what he thinks the patriarchy is. Often with my guy friends I find that they think it's a very rigid set of literal scenarios from the 50's, which (they think) don't happen any more, or that ""the patriarchy"" is code for ""men, all of whom are sexist assholes.""   I feel like when guys hear ""patriarchy,"" they think it's a way for women to demonize them and blame them for all of our problems, which they find offensive because they personally consider themselves respectful and have never done any of these horrible things women are mad at them for.   So what I find most effective is what others are saying, to re-define patriarchy for him in a way that helps him see how it hurts everyone, including him. ""The patriarchy is the social convention that men should not show weakness or hug their friends. The patriarchy is why you're expected to pay for dates and be the one who asks the woman on the date in the first place. It's why male victims of sexual assault are less mentioned and have less resources than their female counterparts.""  Anything he resents about women, or his interactions with them, can likely be linked back to the patriarchy somehow. You just need to help him see that we're all on the same side, fighting together against the patriarchy, which is just a set of societal beliefs we ALL are susceptible too.   Fighting the patriarchy just means constantly reminding yourself and others that your preconceived notions about the ways men and women ""should"" be are actually just arbitrary limitations we place on ourselves and others."

Don't tell him what to think or even facts. People just buckle down and get defensive. Just ask him questions. If he's capable of empathy and reason, he'll connect the dots he's been ignoring.   Do you believe sexism exist?   Have you ever experienced sexism towards yourself, a man?   How did that feel?   Are there important women in your life?   Have they complained about sexism?   Do you think they're liars?   Basically you have to ask leading questions and even be a little aggressive at the end with your questions at the end.

Refuse to engage on that level; only use ""I"" statements and avoid buzzwords redefined by antifeminists like privilege or patriarchy.

Towards the end of the day shift I'm sitting on a vhair and shooting the shit with the day guys and the few nightshifters who've come in a bit early. I left the break room at the end of the shift and started walking toward the gate. Realized I had forgotten my key card that gets scanned to unlock the gate and also clock me out. So I turn around and walk back in to the break room. Open the door, and one of the nightshift guys is smelling and rubbing his face on the chair I was just sitting in a minute ago. This guy is just burying his face in this and is loud. The other four men in the break room look up when the door opens, sniffing guy doesn't notice me. Of course I go ""What the fuck?!?!"" Sniffing guy freezes, looks up. Other guys wave it off, ""Oh he does this to all women's chairs. He likes the smell of sweaty women. No big deal don't bitch."" I grab my card off the table, give everyone the 'I will murder you' look and inform them all that shit is fucked up. Leave."
FemmeThoughts,3aeskl,TIGit,8,Fri Jun 19 22:14:44 2015 UTC,I don't have many words to explain how that would make me feel. These are regular occurrences? They are more disturbing than fiction.

Because, apparently, someone in another section said something someone overheard a snippet of and took to be possibly negative about the administration. Yes, the 6 executive assistants are now responsible for 850 other people and their morale. Can't possibly be the responsibility of the executives./s So, my co-worker and I have been doing this (description: pip boy from fallout) for days and saying ""super great"". Yeah, it's not a mature way to deal, but we're faking it till we make it (or get fired).   Edit to add description of image."

I'm all for workplaces trying to create a positive invironment, or enforcing things like no tollerance of bigotry or trying to enforce some political correctness, but it seems weird that they are going so far as to make people be positive.

As a woman I fear growing old because it feels like I'm not allowed to grow old because then I will be saggy and wrinkly which means (according to society) that I will be un-fuckable and being fuckable is my 'job ' as a woman isn't it?

FemmeThoughts,3a5qvm,capitalsigma,31,Wed Jun 17 21:26:17 2015 UTC,"Certainly, but men are subconsciously associated with authority. So when a man says something stupid, one's first impulse is more likely to wonder if he knows something you don't, or to stay silent to avoid a confrontation."

I have male friends who have been drugged on purpose. Not even at gay bars as the article calls out. I actually know more guys than girls that have been drugged on purpose.  13) As a hairy male there is still a lot of negative social stigma to this. It's a weird line to walk and it took me a long time to become semi-comfortable with the hair on my chest alone.   19) Seriously what is this bullshit. I warned my wife about this when she asked if she should start streaming games.   21) Be careful here, I know a guy that my friends make fun of for how many partners he has had.

From left to right right to left, they depict the following:  1st Panel— Wonderwoman is holding a wounded man in her arms. She says to him: ""We've got to get you patched up.""  ""Say, you're pretty strong,"" the man says. ""For a girl.""  2nd Panel— Wonderwoman replies: ""No, I'm just pretty strong.""  The man visibly cringes. ""I didn't mean to offend..."" he says.  3rd Panel— Wonderwoman narrows her eyes. ""That doesn't mean you didn't,"" she says."

FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,kitkatness,31,Wed Jun 17 03:23:27 2015 UTC,"It was a small family run business.

It sounds like she has had some issue with her husband and other women in some capacity and she decided to take it out on you. I would bet that she would have kicked you out anyway for being a ""pretty girl"" because of issues in her marriage. That is not to say that you're not pretty of course but the problem is hers, not yours!"
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,EconOverlord,30,Wed Jun 17 15:23:56 2015 UTC,"The dress is not the problem. She is not the problem. How she reacted and worded her sentences are the problems. Having a problem with salespeople is kind of expected. But, really, she should have just said ""We don't want any, thanks."" Or taken your card and tossed it as soon as you left. That person was unnecessarily nasty and made it personal. Don't take it that way."
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,yeoz,47,Wed Jun 17 03:54:52 2015 UTC,"Damn, that lady was being misogynistic (by assuming you're there to seduce businessmen) and misandric (by assuming the businessmen would become seduced into doing business). Did anything seem off about her? Or do you think, after doing whatever for 30 years, they recently come across a scenario where someone did try to seduce them?  Either way, she acted paranoid as heck, so I'd try not to dwell on it too much. A peplum dress with long sleeves shouldn't disturb anyone who's not stuck the 50s."
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,Raptorex,21,Wed Jun 17 03:31:18 2015 UTC,The thing that makes this so hard is that I am always paranoid that I am not being conservative enough. I see what my female counterparts wear and I am like 'wow I wish I could be that bold'  They look great and comfortable. I always try to be extremely conservative especially being in the S.E. in the U.S.   A longer sleeve peplum below knee length is more than appropriate in my experience. The fact that I got thrown out for seducing anyone in the one summer outfit I was extremely confident was a middle ground really hurt my pride.
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,terpichor,16,Wed Jun 17 03:35:20 2015 UTC,"The real root of the matter, as EconOverlord suggests, is that she's just a misogynist.  The key line is ""Get out now. I am tired of people in [your industry] sending pretty girls out here to seduce these men into doing business.""  Any woman no matter how they were dressed would be turned away by her. If one of your male colleagues showed up instead, no matter how they were dressed, she wouldn't have accused them of being there to 'seduce' the other men at her business, solely because they are men.  No matter how you were dressed you would've been kicked out, simply because you are a woman; and it hadn't been for the made-up reason of how you were dressed, it would've just been another. It was just a random excuse for her to ask you to leave, without exposing her misogyny directly, until you pressed the issue.  This is not your fault. This is not because of how you were dressed. She's just got awful sexist, misogynist views."
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,Adahn5,30,Wed Jun 17 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"WTF?! This woman sounds like a psycho. She is the problem, not the way you dress."

Now I am just questioning a lot of interactions I've had in the last four years and wondering what I could do better in the future.   Like I've said, it's really messed with my head."
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,AnnaKarenina7423,23,Wed Jun 17 03:23:25 2015 UTC,"I think psycho is a little strong, but I'd bet she has other reasons for her reaction (though I agree, it isn't on you op). Bad day, a few grating salespeople, maybe her boss gives her shit. I know it's hard not to take things like that personally, but try to not let it get to you too much :) also that dress sounds fabulous."
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,clairebones,21,Wed Jun 17 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think psycho is a good term to use either. I think she's the owner's wife who has had some bad experiences with reps in the past and their interaction with him. That's what my boss said and how he took it, not that I was at fault. It still hurts and makes me wonder what I could have done better to be less offensive.   Working in outside sales you want everyone to like you."
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,BeeSilver9,9,Wed Jun 17 03:26:42 2015 UTC,"You weren't wrong to wear that in the least, and there's nothing unprofessional about it. I've spoken to and worked with a lot of people in Diplomatic circles, and the staff of either consulates and embassies that are women wear anything from smart casual, to dresses the kind you described, to pant suits, to skirt suits. In real estate it's the same thing, I've seen dresses as well as suits.   It may be a personal hang up of this person's, perhaps they were showing some degree of insecurity either because of some bad history with her husband or past sales people, who knows, it's just speculation. But set your mind at ease, you're a competent, professional, intelligent woman and your choice of clothing was fair and fine ^^"
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,Redkiteflying,3,Wed Jun 17 04:31:56 2015 UTC,"I work in a rural area in the SE, though we're only about an hour or so from some large-ish cities with big universities. A colleague of mine is a lawyer, and she was told one day that she would be unable to visit her client in the jail because she was dressed inappropriately.   She was wearing black slacks, and an elbow-length shirt with a v-neck. Her neckline was just below her collarbone--there was nothing you could call cleavage showing AT ALL.   In cases like this, it's almost always more about the person enforcing the rules (or probably making them up as in your case) than the person wearing the clothes. Sounds like a young attractive woman had to be wearing a burkah to get in to see her husband. Makes you wonder what he's done to previous sales people? Maybe you actually dodged a bullet there..."
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,mimigrape,6,Wed Jun 17 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"She sounds like she leads a very sad life, to be so mean and spiteful towards someone she had never met."

It sounds like she is dealing with some personal issues, like if she's feeling self conscious that her husband is surrounded by saleswomen all day who she feels are more attractive than her.   I know it's hard, but I don't think you should beat yourself up over this! If you've never had other complaints, and even your boss is saying this wasn't your fault, then I think it's something to just put behind you when you can."

I bet you a shiny donut with colorful sprinkles that the aquaintances of this woman would say ""You think that's nasty and/or strange, let me tell you about the time she...""  What you have done, and it's not unusual and it's not your fault, is mistaken a person with serious mental issues for a sane person. And I'm not even knocking the mentally ill aspect as wrong, it's just that it's not your fault she's paranoid and therefore hurtful. She is trying. She's trying to fit in, her and her external manifestation of internal anxiety AKA yippy dog. Her interpretation of an appropriate professional mission is to protect the restaurant industry from brazen hussies in midlength peplum.   You got off easy."
FemmeThoughts,3a4aue,killertofuuuuu,2,Wed Jun 17 07:09:34 2015 UTC,"I suspect it had nothing to do with your dress and was actually because you were cold-calling and she thought you were trying to sell them something. She was incredibly rude and inappropriate though. I understand that some people get very angry with sales people turning up announced, and it sounds like she let rip and said whatever she thought would be most hurtful.   I'm really sorry this happened to you, but I really think this about her just wanting to get rid of you rather than there being any actual problem with your dress."
FemmeThoughts,3a12op,shannondoah,20,Tue Jun 16 11:55:58 2015 UTC,"Rape is at least formally viewed as illegal or wrong in the USA, especially hateful rape. There is a growing understanding that women are people. That women are not just men in women suits, but actual people. Yeah, I know, you would think that was obvious.   A common problem I find, with Reddit in particular, is people who simply don't understand how consent works or how or why to get it, but who aren't particularly hateful or cruel. Often they are clumsy and selfish, and this can easily lead to rape, like date rape, acquaintance rape. There are a lot of people, who don't understand that rape isn't just a deliberate thing that happens in parking lots among strangers. It has do do with consent, and often American men don't know why they should ask for it, and it feels weird, and they're defensive, because this is new.   It's new. This idea that yes means yes, and no means no, and that you can on purpose ask for what you want, and then that it's important to get an answer.   It's confusing, but I think the culture is changing and things are getting explained and defined culturally in America at a good rate. I'm horrified that so many women ( and men, but shit, so so many women ) get mistreated and dismissed, and I'm hoping for a better world.   Then I read things like this, and that is some next level medieval torture horrible shit. I'm going to need to remember to take extra care to make space for Indian women's stories and honor their choices, because the behavior they're enduring is dehumanizing in ways I have not experienced."

This idea that yes means yes, and no means no, and that you can on purpose ask for what you want, and then that it's important to get an answer.   It's more than that. It's the cultural notion that women are of course supposed to say no, even if they mean yes. And men are of course supposed to pursue. Otherwise, how are they supposed to ever get laid? Women put up the roadblocks, men overcome them. That's just how it is.  And there are women who do that. Who say ""no"" just because they're supposed to. Because they don't want to be thought of as ""easy."" Because they like to play hard to get.   But those women shouldn't get any! Men should start taking all ""no"" responses seriously. Women will start saying ""yes"" when they mean yes not long after that. (Meanwhile, the women who don't play games will get all the action.)"

FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,so_srs,18,Mon Jun 15 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"""But it's all about realism! And authenticity in the time period!"" Right right... realism and authenticity. With dragons and undead creatures, magic and shadow demons. Totes realism in showing violent misogyny against women, where they're treated as sex objects to be raped and mutilated on a whim.  No problem either with the exaltation of the Feudal nobility, where all the peasants are portrayed as miserable, disgusting scum and their only purpose is to die for their ""betters"".  I'm not very surprised at the reaction people are having, and to some extent it's somewhat ironic to me, having read the books, because none of this was a surprise to me. It's pretty much what you expect from a visual depiction on screen of what has occurred throughout A Song of Ice And Fire."

FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,Adahn5,7,Mon Jun 15 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"I read the books, thanks, even if it's been a few years. Still think the show is way worse in the way it depicts it."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,Paraplueschi,3,Mon Jun 15 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"If you say so.  Edit: Someone's down-voting the two of us x3  Edit 2: You might think that show is worse, and perhaps it is because it is a visual medium, but read what Crates & Ribbons says here:   A Song of Ice and Fire, rape or abuse of women happen on almost every page. They are depicted in an offhand manner, completely gratuitous, and pass without comment. Worse, the perpetrators are frequently portrayed as sympathetic characters instead of villains. I came across a rape/assault reference almost every five minutes, and to give you an idea of just how much random rape that adds up to, each book is about 800 to over 1000 pages long."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,Adahn5,18,Mon Jun 15 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"That's not true. I can think of about 6 instances of rape being mentioned in the series with a little more detail (Lolis getting raped by that angry mob, the story Arya hears about the tavern daughter, Jeyne Poole, Pia, the women at Craster's, Tysha). There's probably a bunch I have forgotten (especially if we count every reference - whatever that means), but it's nowhere near that many. And the characters who do it are certainly depicted as bad people (Ramsay, Gregor Clegane, Bloody Mummers, Craster, Tywin). Also the whole theme of the series are grey characters. A character can do shitty but also good things. It's interesting.   Depicting a misogynistic world does not automaticall make the work misogynistic as well. I fail to see how you can even compare the show to the books. Sure, the books have lots violence against women (and really, violence against anyone), but it's never in there to give you a hard on or 'to show off boobies'. Unlike the show who added a lot of violence against women that isn't even there originally or not even half as detailed (for example Jeyne Poole's rape (Sansa in the show)...the chapter stops before it happens. We get implications and later through her dialogue with Theon we learn what might have happened to her - and it's really brutal, yes, but it's all in your own head. Much like basically everything Ramsay does to people). While in the show...well it's pretty in your face. Rape them till they're dead, eh?  I actually find the books downright progressive in how they treat the stuff. Showing characters struggle with the result of the violence they experienced and treating it with a certain gravity. Like, take the awful shit that happens with Pia, who is really just an unimportant side character. It actually gets a small story arc! While on the show, rape happens for the titty quota and no one ever mentions it again after it happens (see Craster's rape house or that Cersei scene). It's basically just there to be edgy and show off naked women.  The books aren't perfect by any means. But unlike the show they actually deserve some praise. Especially for their female characters (at least the POV ones)."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,Paraplueschi,14,Mon Jun 15 22:43:12 2015 UTC,"::HEAVY SPOILERS::  All right let's cut through the old crap cake here, shall we? Because every single time discussion of Game of Thrones or A Song of Ice and Fire comes up, there's gotta be someone who apologises for rape and violence against women. I guess this time it's you.    but it's nowhere near that many    Here's the Statistical Analysis of Rape in Game of Thrones/aSoIaF. Enjoy.  The claim that the Game of Thrones show has featured rape more prominently than in Martin’s books is utter bullshit.    Rape acts in Game of Thrones the TV series (to date): 50  Rape victims in Game of Thrones (to date): 29  Rape acts in ASOIAF the book series (to date): 214  Rape victims in ASOIAF (to date): 117  The books contain over 4 times as much rape as the show (and probably even more; the method of analysis likely underestimates the rape in the books - see below).   Here's are those numbers broken down:   Below please find a list of all rapes and attempted rapes, broken down in sections (incidents that appear in both, incidents that appear in the show only, incidents that appear in the book only).  Rapes/Attempted Rapes that Appear In Both Works: 34 Victims in Both Works: 24  Elia Martell: raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane (described only)  Many Lhazareen women: raped by the Dothraki including  Mirri Maz Duur: raped by the Dothraki multiple times (Dany stops one of the rapes mid-attack)  Craster’s daughters: raped by Clubfoot Karl, Dirk, Ollo Lophand and other former members of the Night’s Watch   Brienne: attempted rape by Locke/members of Vargo Hoat’s crew  (Jaime distracts him and gets his hand cut off)  Tysha: gang-raped by Tywin Lannister’s men; Tyrion is forced to have sex with her after the others are done (described only)  Rhaella Targaryen: raped by King Aerys while Jaime Lannister listened  Rapes/Attempted Rapes that Appear in the Show Only: 16 Victims in Show Only: 5 (see below section re: Craster’s daughters)  Daenerys Targaryen: Raped by Drogo on their wedding night.  Cersei Lannister: Raped by her brother Jaime next to their son’s corpse. (NOTE: According to the actors, the producer, the director and the production crew, this is not a rape scene. Their intent was to walk it right up to the non-con line and pull back. The Game of Thrones wikia does not categorize it as rape, citing authorial intent. Given that it’s damn clearly a rape scene, I am categorizing it as such despite the authorial intent.)  Sansa Stark: raped by Ramsay Snow (transferred from Jeyne Poole in the book), attempted rape by mob  Meera: attempted rape by Karl  Craster’s daughters: raped by Karl’s men when Jon Snow and his men come to rescue them. (In the books there is never any retaliation against Karl’s men for what they did, although some are killed by someone accompanying Bran. We can assume that had Jon Snow and his men gone back to retaliate against the traitors, this is what they would have seen, but it doesn’t appear in the books.)  Innkeeper’s daughter: Polliver and other Lannister men are attempting rape when Sandor and Arya arrive. They release her at that time. Sandor kills the Lannister men and the girl escapes. (In the books there does not appear to be a rape attempt.)  Rapes/Attempted Rapes that Appear in the Book Only: 180 Victims in Book Only: 93  Sansa Stark: Marillion attempts to rape her on Littlefinger and Lysa’s wedding night  Lollys Stokeworth: Gang-raped by at least 50 men  Donella Hornwood: raped by Ramsay Snow, who then locks her in a tower and starves her to death  Peasant girl: raped and murdered by Ramsay Snow  Peasant girl’s corpse: raped by Reek (the first)  Jeyne Poole: raped by Ramsay Snow and his dogs; Reek/Theon is forced to participate (transferred to Sansa Stark in the show but the dogs and Theon’s participation are omitted)  Eroeh: raped by Mago, rescued by Dany, then raped by Mago, Jhaqo and six members of the khalasar before being murdered (in the show Mago is killed)  12 women of Saltpans: raped by outlaws. Victims include but not limited to:  A twelve year old girl raped by Rorge with a stick: her nose and nipples were then cut off by his men  A woman raped by a dozen men, then had her breasts torn apart by Biter  Holy women  Pia: raped repeatedly by Lannister men, Bolton men and Gregor Clegane and his men. Described as “promiscuous” as a result. (Counting this as 10 acts although the number is probably far greater)  Victarion’s salt wife: raped by Euron Greyjoy  Maester Kerwin: raped by four members of Victarion Greyjoy’s crew  Numerous little boys: raped and murdered by Septon Utt (counting this as 10)  Maidenpool woman: raped by one of Gregor Clegane’s men (I missed this on my first pass)  At least one of Lord Hewett’s daughters: raped by Left-Hand Lucas Codd as she served dinner to the Ironborn after they conquered Oakenshield. (Missed this on my first pass.)  Former slave women: raped by the Sons of the Harpy  Women of Stony Sept: raped by Karstark men (missed this on my first pass)  Women of Sherrer: raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane’s men (missed this on my first pass)  Brienne: attempted rape by Vargo Hoat at Harrenhall (that’s why she winds up in the bear pit in the book; in the show it is because her father does not send sufficient ransom money and this rape attempt is not included)  Ramsay Snow’s mother: raped by Roose Bolton on her wedding day beneath the swaying corpse of her husband, who had been hung by Roose for trying to prevent the rape (may be included later in the show)  Meris: raped by half the members of a sellsword company (counting them as 10 acts)  Layna: a 13 year old girl gang raped by Gregor Clegane, Raff the Sweetling, Chiswick, Joss Stillwood, Tobbot, Eggon and several other of Clegane’s men after the Tourney of the Hand that commemorated Ned Stark’s ascension to the position. Clegane’s men demanded money from her father after committing the rape.  Jonos Bracken’s daughter: raped by Gregor Clegane  Palla: raped by Drennan and another of the Ironborn during the capture of Winterfell  Danaerys Targaryen: raped by Drogo multiple times (”Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from begind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep.”) (Note: GRRM has stated that marital rape did not exist in this era, but see my above note about authorial intent vs. something that is damn obviously rape.)  Slave prostitute: raped by Tyrion (see above note about authorial intent vs. evident rape)  Taena Merryweather: raped by Cersei (she says that Cersei is hurting her; given that Cersei is the queen she is not in a position to refuse - see above note about authorial intent vs. evident rape)  Women of Tumbler’s Falls: raped and murdered by Robb Stark’s army  Women of Winterfell: Ramsay Snow sends them into the woods with half a days’ head start; they are then hunted by Ramsay and his dogs, and if caught raped, flayed alive and fed to the dogs. (Note: in the show version, Ramsay kills the woman but neither rapes her nor flays her alive.)  In A Dance With Dragons Chapter 32, Theon mentally notes that, since Ramsay names his dogs after girls he’s killed in this manner, one of the dogs will be named Kira. Based on this, women who were raped and killed in this manner include but are not limited to:  Grey Jeyne  Helicent  Jez  Alison  Maude  Red Jeyne  Sara   Willow   But it's nowhere near that many, right /u/Paraplueschi? Right? Right?    Sure, the books have lots violence against women (and really, violence against anyone), but it's never in there to give you hard on or 'to show off boobies'.    What the actual fuck? The violence is prominently featured beyond its necessity precisely because it's sensationalist and titillating. You think entertainment happens in a vacuum? No, it affects people. It normalises violence against women and trivialises rape.    I actually find the books downright progressive in how they treat the stuff.    If that's progressive then I don't know what the hell conservative would be in your mind.    But unlike the show they actually deserve some praise.    Most writers that I've spoken to, and I know a few, do have some faint praise for it. Things to do with pacing, with perspective, point of view, mechanics, even development to a degree. I'll concede all of that. But the mistreatment of women and the gratuitous use of rape when it serves no purpose what so ever, when it's used so casually? No. I'll respect shit and piss first before I respect it, or the people like you who defend it."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,Adahn5,17,Mon Jun 15 23:14:55 2015 UTC,"Stop being so agressive. I did not attack you.  Most of this list contains things that are mentioned in passing and not even in detail or even names. To quote Oberyn ""Her raped her, he murdered her, he killed her children"". That does not equal male gaze or anything similar that you claimed. It's just saying ""Xy got raped"". Yes, Ramsay's dogs are named after girls he killed. But that's it. How is this pornographic or for the male gaze? It's brutal, creepy and disgusting, sure. In general Ramsay's character is at times overly gratuitous. But in the show you actually have to see it and it's even more pointless. Heck, they even had to add Theon's castration scene, which was barely implied in the books and of course they had to add naked women in that scene as well, which were indeed filmed for the male gaze. It was just absurd.  Honestly I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to this stuff, but I really don't think it's a fair comparison. While I don't care whether you like it or not (I can see how it can be too much for people) I disagree vehemently with you that it is thrown in as casually as you claim. It is thrown in way, waaay more casually in the show.   Edit: Re what I find conservative: The show, for example."

Those specific instances aren't. And either you don't understand what Male Gaze is or you're deliberately trotting out examples that are not only unrelated but absurd to support your claim.  It is the equivalent of quoting a scene of Aria hugging her father and then saying ""how's that gratuitous violence ???"". Of course it isn't, stop being intellectually dishonest.    Like yea Ramsay's dogs are named after girls he killed. But that's it.    Sorry that's not ""it""—it implies they were murdered and the fact that their only purpose in the text was to be used up as names for Ramsey's dogs shows the casual disregard for the lives of women. They weren't men, they were explicitly women. Stop dismissing it.    Honestly I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to this stuff, but I really don't think it's a fair comparison.    The numbers are there, ignore them all you like. Tiger Beatdown wrote about this, so too has Alyssa Rosenberg on Think Progress. The comparison is made because it is both fair and overwhelming.    I disagree vehemently with you that it is thrown in casually. It is thrown in way, waaay more casually in the show.    ""Martin’s books have gotten more of a free pass because it’s easier to deal with horrendous actions when you read about them on paper, versus seeing them acted out on screen."" From i09. And more has been written about how A Song of Ice and Fire uses rape casually:   George R. R. Martin uses nameless women’s bodies as character development for male antagonists in A Song of Ice and Fire. Rape victims serve as props and set decoration to illustrate a man’s depravity. Social class does not protect them. The only raped women who tell us their tales, either directly through inner monologue or by telling their story to another character, are villains. Despite numerous claims, Martin’s portrayal of rape is not supported by history....  There are also many people that argue that George R.R. Martin is only showing us what history was really like. However, the story is not directly reflective of history. While it is true that most of the horrific events took place in history at one time or another, Martin is using horrific events from over the course of a thousand years – but squeezing them into a story with about a 2-year span (so far). In addition to cherry-picking his horrors, he’s also cherry-picking the social elements of society in a way that doesn’t stand up to a historical analysis.   Disagree as vehemently as you like, hold your opinion as tightly as you like, it doesn't make it right."

They weren't men, they were explicitly women. Stop dismissing it.   No, their only purpose was there to make you feel fucking worried for Jeyne Poole, Theon and everyone else Ramsay interacts with. His character is an incredibly menacing presence. It made me hold my breath several times. You can think of that what you want. Too much? Not necessary? Maybe. But interestingly, the books had no need to ever give him an extensive sex or rape scene regardless. Or to give him as much 'screen time'. The show did.   I agree with the problematic way GRRM displays history in general, but frankly, that's a whole other platter.   I find it by the way kind of ridiculous to call any of the POV characters a villain. And even if that were the case (which it isn't) does rape suddenly have less of an impact when it's done to a character that has also done bad things? Do Cerseis deeds negate her feelings and make her experiences any less bad?"
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,Adahn5,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:30:25 2015 UTC,"This is the world that was built. Violent things happen to people of all genders and orientations. Look what happens to Theon. Or the male prostitutes that Victarion picks up. Tyrion loses his nose and becomes so ugly that he's forced to join a freak show where he is objectified and abused. Many men and women are raped, and yes more women than men. But isn't that statistically accurate? More men die violent deaths and isn't that also statistically accurate?   What would be your ideal?  No rape whatsoever would be fantastic, I'll admit. But also unrealistic. This is a how where an old woman will poison a king because she's concerned he'll beat her granddaughter. Where an assassin will murder a student to use his face. Where everyone just coolly accepts that an entire noble house is built on the idea that torture is OK. If rape was the ONE violent act left out, it would be weird. If men can read it and overcome the horrible things that happen to Robb, women can read it and overcome the things that happen to Cersei. Women are capable like that.  And if you're not capable, that's fine. Everybody has triggers or at least personal taste, you don't HAVE to like it. You are welcome to stop consuming the media."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,WadeK,0,Tue Jun 16 14:02:29 2015 UTC,"This is the world that was built. Violent things happen to people of all genders and orientations.   Yes and disproportionately so toward women. Your examples of men suffering is well made, but they are hardly suffering because they are men. The same cannot be said for women, and Martin set out to do so in the first place:    the books reflect a patriarchal society based on the Middle Ages. The Middle Ages were not a time of sexual egalitarianism. It was very classist, dividing people into three classes. And they had strong ideas about the roles of women. One of the charges against Joan of Arc that got her burned at the stake was that she wore men’s clothing.    Source.   What would be your ideal? No rape whatsoever would be fantastic, I'll admit. But also unrealistic.   You can remove most of the rape if it has neither bearing or meaning in the scheme of the plot. Can rape be a narrative tool? Can it serve some purpose and be portrayed respectfully, yes. Guy Gavriel Kay in his trilogy of the Fionavar Tapestry, uses rape once and it is intrinsically linked to the plot. It's treated as an extremely traumatic event, it involves all of the characters and there is a gradual process both of understanding of it, of justice, and of healing that comes into play. It takes the time to explore the issues within it.  Similar in the Triple Trilogy of the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, there is a single occurence of rape perpetuated by the main character, and the effect it has on both the victim and the perpetrator take several books to explore. There's long-lasting trauma, there's an attempt at forgiveness, justice, redemption of the perpetrator, and an acknowledgement of the event in an infinitely more meaningful manner. It isn't casually used nor gratuitously employed.   But isn't that statistically accurate?   What exactly is it you're trying to say here? That Martin is just telling it like it is, being faithful to our statistics that women indeed get raped more than men? What's the purpose of the point you're trying to make?   More men die violent deaths and isn't that also statistically accurate?   Again, what exactly is your point with this? Or are you just asking rhetorical questions? Men die violent deaths because they are either forced to do so in battle by other men above their station, or because they themselves decide to engage in violent trade. Those responsible for men's deaths are, almost always other men.   If rape was the ONE violent act left out, it would be weird.   It would be weird? I guess frosty zombies are okay though...   You are welcome to stop consuming the media.   If you don't like it get out. Got it. However this isn't about me, nor is it about you. It's about the wider context in which media is consumed. These narratives, whether on screen or on the page do not exist in a vacuum as I said. There are many articles one, two, three, just from a brief search on the internet, that you can read about how the trivialisation of rape perpetuates and normalises rape in our culture.  We shouldn't call the millions of women in the world, and yes men too, who are raped and abused ""normal"". And we shouldn't portray it and simultaneously shrug our shoulders and call it normal or inevitable. In real life 97% of rapists never spend a single day of their lives in jail and yet we hate them, don't we? Or is it that we've normalised rape and trivialised it so much that we don't consider it such a big deal anymore?  Again, that doesn't mean it we shouldn't depict it. But the manner in which we do should at the very least attempt to tackle it in some way that doesn't reinforce the completely disdain society has for women, their bodies, their will, and their safety with the casual flick of a page."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,anarchistica,2,Mon Jun 15 23:56:44 2015 UTC,"If you don't like it get out.   Hardly what I meant.  If you don't agree with it, you are welcome to stop consuming it and giving them your viewership/ratings/money/whatever.  Vote with your money.  If you find it to be offensive, don't give it your patronage.  Especially since it's a theme that's been prevalent since Book 1, so it's not like we've been tricked into reading about/watching it.  I also never called someone who was raped ""Normal"" and can't help but wonder why you imply that, or even bring it up.  Nobody is saying it's normal or that it shouldn't change.  I'm only saying that it perhaps makes sense that equal amounts of violence happen to both genders, and because of the nature of the medieval-style world, perhaps it makes statistical sense that Jamie would have to go through the trauma and torture of losing a limb while Brienne would have to go through the trauma of nearly being raped.  In patriarchal, medieval societies like this, rape isn't going to be aimed equally at both genders.    Also, your other examples aren't Game of Thrones.  They don't have the same writing. They don't have the same plots.  They're not made for the same audiences.  You can't compare Sherlock Holmes to Silence of the Lambs, even though they both involve detectives and solving crimes.  Why would you vilify one for being more violent than the other?    And the characters do deal with rape as a traumatic and horrible thing.  Cersei is nearly broken by her naked walk.  Tysha flees Westeros.  Sansa is terrified and deals with Marillon's attack, and Littlefinger ensures that he is blamed for killing Lysa - and then killed for it.  The only time a rape is ever treated lightly is Lollys - and we as the readers aren't supposed to think that the people treating her like shit are good people.  She is traumatised to the point of listlessness and it's the villains of the series who are rolling their eyes.  And of course the villains will roll their eyes.  Cersei has no concept of not being in control, so she wouldn't understand trauma.  Lolly's mother just wants to please the Lannisters and didn't hold back from shit-talking her daughter BEFORE it happened, why would she stop after?  I just feel like if you are watching the assaults and rapes that happen (or reading about them) and getting anything besides, ""Holy shit that was a horrible thing"" then that's on you.  Because the only people in the books who aren't completely off-put by the idea of rape are the bad guys, and the average reader/show watcher isn't going to sympathize with the likes of Gregor Clegane or Tywin."

I do think that Stannis (along with Ned) had a sense of honour and always trying to do the ""right"" thing, even if the ""right"" thing was violent.  In a series where basically everyone is violent, people respect Ned carrying out executions himself, or Stannis forcing even his nobles to follow the same rules peasants follow with the same punishments.  I think people like the Faceless Men because they're mysterious, and mysterious in these sorts of stories equal ""cool"".  Plus they're on Arya's side, and at this point fans are likely cheering for Arya & Friends rather than the Faceless Men on their own, lol."

Robb gets thousands killed in a vain attempt to save his daddy. Cat encourages him and trades a valuable hostage for just her daughters. She's fucking stupid too, only a complete moron would believe someone gives an nth rate assassin a traceable weapon.  Compare that to Walder Frey, who ends the war, sacrificing his own son in the process. He's right in the middle of the war and loses only 50 men.   I do think that Stannis (along with Ned) had a sense of honour and always trying to do the ""right"" thing   Stannis literally murders his own brother because he came out of their mom's vagina first.  Eddard never uses his brain. He is the product of a 5000 year northern dictatorship (compared to 67 for the Kims) and still completely incompetent when it comes to politics. Instead of listening to Renly he whines about dishonoring Robert and Stannis being the legit king. He only wants to dispose Joffrey because he came from the wrong sperm too, lol."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,Adahn5,-1,Tue Jun 16 20:04:14 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from.  Robb's push to break the North away from the other kingdoms was perhaps completely noble on one side, but stupid on the other.  Certainly he should never have broken his betrothal to the Frey woman (and had he kept his promise, he may have wont he war and we would view him as a freedom fighter who refused to let his people be ruled by the southern kingdoms that hate them).    Cat isn't ""fucking stupid"", I think she's a mother who is concerned about her son who was just nearly murdered.  I think she made a wrong decision in assuming it was Tyrion, but why didn't the learned Maester - who is supposed to be highly educated and trained to think critically - counter her?  She's not meant to be a sleuth, she's meant to run a household and raise children.  I dislike Cat for how she treated Jon Snow.  I think that was despicable.  I also think she was brash and idiotic in kidnapping Tyrion rather than pursuing justice through the proper channels.  And for releasing Jamie Lannister.  Though, to be fair, he's just 'some kings guard' and her daughters are heirs to the North and powerful marriage bargaining chips (in the politics of the world - I hate referring to them like that).  In terms of importance, the daughters are worth more, which is why Tywin didn't want to do a trade.  That aside, all of these poor choices came from her devotion to her children, even if the devotion blinded her.  For some reason I totally forgot about the demon baby, lol.  Though Renly was the younger brother, the reason he was well-supported was because he was more charismatic than Stannis and had Loras' support of Highgarden.  Stannis killed him in a terrible way because he saw Renly's success in his claim as a perversion of the 'right' and 'natural' order.  Maybe murder was too harsh, but he was on the verge of a battle with Renly's troops and probably saved many soldier's lives by taking out the king.  Again, depending which side of that battle you're on is how you interpret how 'evil' the act is (and I'm with you in that it was totally a dick move.  At least in the books Stannis was haunted by the decision and obsessed over whether it was the Right Thing to Do)  Ned is naive.  He's a good ""dictator"", the comparison to North Korea is silly.  He runs his kingdom without much support from the south fairly well and he is well-loved by both the nobility and the smallfolk.  I think he's probably the only ""good"" person in the world, and he should have stayed up in Winterfell.  I think his death was Martin illustrating that pure Good requires naivete and it's nearly impossible to fight corruption with heart and honour alone.  His backing of Stannis was because it was Right, as Stannis is technically next in line for the throne."

I want to see a LOT of bad characters punished like this.  Heck, Theon got his genitals chopped off and tortured to the point of mental breakdown and he wasn't even half as evil as Cersei.  I understand not wanting all this rape in the show.  I do think that the little girl think was excessive, but it was a great way to show that Arya hasn't become no-one (she never would have gotten this sort of access to Meryn Trant if he were into adult women) in a show where we can't get into her thoughts like we can in the books.     An objection may be justified, but the more logical protest would be against the show’s thin, utilitarian characterizations and the increasingly tone-deaf nature of its formerly tolerable mix of full-metal medieval-fantasy violence and soap-opera sentimentality.   What is this even supposed to mean, pseudo-academic wording aside?  I don't know if it's because it's written in the worst jumble of words I've seen outside my college freshmen writing classes or not, but it's just terrible writing.  I only see people write like this when they want to criticize but can't think of anything critical to say.  The article says that Cersei's walk makes sense and is ok, then it says that it was objectification.  It complains about Jon's death as typical Hollywood emotion-stringing while ignoring that this is very nearly exactly how he died in the books - as a cliffhanger.  And why does his death have any less poignancy than Stannis'?  In fact, I thought that Jon's was even more poignant with Ollie taking the last stab and clearly weighing his choices for a moment before he did.  I also am shocked that the writer complains that nothing has changed.  The Boltons are in Winterfell... but Myranda is dead, Sansa and Theon have fled, they have destroyed Stannis' army and Roose is going to have another child which could usurp Ramsay's position.  That's a hell of a change.  Sansa is in no way ""on the run"" in the same situation that she was in episode 1.  Arya is still in Braavos with another name off her list and halfway through training as a badass assassin.  Dany is on a dragon, surrounded by a gigantic Khalasar, not sitting on a pristine throne in an ancient city.  Tyrion has taken her place, instead of being trapped in a barrel on a boat.  The Lannisters barely occupy King's Landing, with the religious conservatives taking over the city.  This season has been great (unnecessary sexual violence aside).  If it's not your thing, there's nothing wrong with not wanting to watch it.  But good heavens, try to come up with a coherent complaint at least!"
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,mbeogoa,9,Tue Jun 16 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"The former high septon also had the same ""Walk of Shame"" treatment earlier in the season so it's not like that was meant to be a punishment designed to shame and objectify women's bodies."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,wildeaboutoscar,6,Tue Jun 16 15:53:42 2015 UTC,"How long exactly did that last compared to Cersei's? About 23 seconds (at a glance) for the septon scene, probably less than a tenth of Cersei's scene. Also no frontal nudity. Also no spit, no shit, no bleeding feet, no waving dicks. Come on."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,WizardofStaz,8,Tue Jun 16 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is totally a fair comparison.  That is not to say that there wasn't any unfairness, but those punishments were nowhere near on the same level for the watchers of the show.  Cersei has been an awful person since season 1 and this was the culmination of that.  It was her finally being broken down like she broke so many others, and her seeing how much she was hated despite being on her high horse for so long.  It will probably also serve as fodder for how she acts in the future.  I really think it was an important scene."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,wildeaboutoscar,2,Mon Jun 15 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think this season has been building to this. Now she's either going to change her tune a bit or be even worse than she usually is. Either way it will be entertaining.  In contrast, the former high septon isn't a main character so obviously we wouldn't want to see it happening for that long.  I'm not a fan of the excessive nudity but it made perfect sense in this scene. Like the septon said, she stripped off everything in order to be clean again. As for all the shit thrown at her? Well, that's what you get for ruling over people you hate and treat terribly."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,WizardofStaz,2,Tue Jun 16 00:46:01 2015 UTC,Not to mention this was a supposedly holy man who slept with prostitutes often and Cersei only confessed to having intercourse with one man.
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,admiral_tuff,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:59:56 2015 UTC,It was her cousin though. And she lied about it.
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,wildeaboutoscar,2,Tue Jun 16 12:31:22 2015 UTC,Well I'm pretty sure the High Septon wasn't making his proclivities known before he was caught either.
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,WizardofStaz,3,Thu Jun 18 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"Yep that's D&D's failing, but I guess they didn't care about a minor background character enough to do more than just establish it as a form of punishment for sexual transgressions."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,kellynw,5,Wed Jun 17 01:41:13 2015 UTC,"Pick any major male character you want, and I guarantee you they wouldn't have filmed the scene the same way for them.  Yeah it's a reflection of how gendered violence would work in reality, but that doesn't excuse perpetuating it."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,elfofdoriath9,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there's a difference in gendered nudity for TV in terms of the network? You never see full frontal male nudity. There may just be a policy in place against it, though I think it's probably because it's seen as more 'offensive' than female nudity which gets both sexes talking."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,WizardofStaz,7,Thu Jun 18 18:08:02 2015 UTC,"Sansa Stark, all grown up and still being passed around by male characters like a sexy lamp.

Not ""Well if I lunge at her maybe I can take her with me"" or even to run away. Just literally ""Okay, I guess you should kill me, I'm resigned to it.""  Like good for you Sansa, your big character trait is resignation, that sure makes you interesting and 3 dimensional."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,WadeK,5,Tue Jun 16 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"Just because a character doesn't act in a way you support or want, doesn't mean they aren't realistic or good characters.  I mean come on, she has been raped, humiliated, beaten, and watched as her entire family dies.  If this happened in real life you bet there would be people who just want it to all end.  And there was a bow pointed in her face...a deadly weapon aimed directly at her.  Not everyone is going to brave enough, have enough skills, or think quickly enough to make it out of that situation alive.  I agree that Sansa is pretty useless and has done nothing to save herself.  But there are people like that in real life and you can't hate on the show for depicting that."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,mbeogoa,6,Tue Jun 16 06:55:34 2015 UTC,"I don't blame Sansa's character for where she is now, but I fault the writers for not doing something better with her character. What is the point in continuously torturing and humiliating the same character? Nothing is gained. At the end of season four we thought we were seeing her finally coming into her own, and, nope, we're gonna see that crushed again. It's gotten stale."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,wildeaboutoscar,4,Tue Jun 16 06:55:48 2015 UTC,"But why?  Some characters are doing pretty awesome things, others are most definitely not.  Think of Theon.  He had a good start, like Sansa.  Then he got continually beat down, physically and emotionally, and the crowd was just WAITING until the day he would finally do something about it.  And he did (when he helped Sansa), and that is great.  But not all characters/people in life are going to have that moment.  Some get beat down and stay down.  Maybe this is all fodder for Sansa to do something cool, maybe it is not.  But that is real life and we shouldn't expect that to change for GOT."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,WadeK,5,Tue Jun 16 01:15:27 2015 UTC,"Because it's bad storytelling. Nobody is going to watch a movie where somebody does literally the same thing for 80% of it and conditions don't ever improve. Theon had a character arc. He felt like a black sheep and made a lot of mistakes and did a lot of terrible stuff to deal with that, and then he got to this point of punishment. Then through Sansa's suffering and abuse he finds a way to rebel.  Sansa has been being passed from terrible man to terrible man, to the point where Tyrion is a high point for her, because though he's relatively old and an alcoholic, he doesn't hurt her or try to sell her. Sure, Tyrion's a sympathetic character, but only because we have access to a lot of information about him. I like him as a character, but I wouldn't marry him to any teenager I knew.  And they teased us with Sansa at the end of season four. They made her look like she'd be getting power over her situation, like she'd have a real character arc, but she doesn't. An arc curves, but hers has been at rock bottom for most of five seasons now. It's bad storytelling."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,WizardofStaz,3,Tue Jun 16 12:23:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, people DO watch movies tv shows where they are doing the same thing, haha.  I guess it is all opinion.  Some people like what is happening, others don't.  To each his own on the subject.  And hey, maybe Sansa just needs some more time.  You never know!"
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,mbeogoa,3,Tue Jun 16 12:54:46 2015 UTC,"I've got my fingers crossed for her making some sort of late-game amazing move.  Not everybody can be doing important stuff all at the same time.  First Ned was doing things, then Robb was doing important things while Bran was running away, then Arya was doing important things at Harrenhal while Robb was making bad choices and Bran was still running, then Bran was doing cool stuff with the Children along with Jon at the wall and everyone else had moved on to be stagnant or dead.  Personally, I want her to become like Cersei - but on the good side.  Manipulative and smart enough to move through court, but with her family's ideals and honour.  Once the Boltons are gone, I wouldn't doubt that the North supports her claims to Winterfell and puts her in power there.  Littlefinger seems to be hinting at this in the books and she's definitely poised for it in the show.  She's just not a fighter like her sister or a strategist like her brothers.  She hasn't yet had her chance to shine, but I think she's being saved for the end."
FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,WizardofStaz,3,Tue Jun 16 13:09:02 2015 UTC,"I agree!  At least, I hope.  I really am waiting for the moment she does something that is awesome!

FemmeThoughts,39y6d5,WizardofStaz,3,Tue Jun 16 16:18:38 2015 UTC,I absolutely can? Why shouldn't I be annoyed about yet another damsel in distress trope? Something being realistic doesn't make it inherently entertaining. If I wanted pure realism I'd  watch a documentary.

You are allowed your opinion.   uh huh...   then just don't watch it.   but you said I was allowed an opinion!

FemmeThoughts,39ymgl,Adahn5,2,Mon Jun 15 21:16:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, but this statement:   For the white women who will help elect her, change is already here; they are ready. Meanwhile, the Black and intersectional feminism that is currently moving grassroots politics in America is addressing legitimate and deep concerns that the feminism that is “Ready For Hillary” has yet to answer.    Is bullshit too /u/UberGroove14. The notion that white women have it made and it's only women of ethnic minorities who continue to need Feminism, is on par with the kind of dismissive thirdworldism many reactionaries engage in to dismiss Feminism. White women may be privileged on the basis of their ethnic background, but they certainly continue to be oppressed on the basis of their gender.  The only women who may claim exemption from most forms of systemic oppession are Capitalist women like Hillary Clinton, Meg Whitman, Sheri McCoy, Marissa Mayer and others. That doesn't mean Miss Mary the waitress or Miss Sheri the web designer, Miss Margarette the DMV clerk or Miss Joanna the college professor don't need Feminism anymore because they just happen to be white.  While a pragmatic argument can be made that women of colour face more systemic oppression because of Racism, Classism and Sexism, and it is unquestionably true that they do—dismissing the plight of women who don't belong to that particular group is a form of sexism.  Ultimately the ""white feminism"" the Ready for Hillary people are talking about is liberal, ""choice"" feminism. This essay claims to stand for intersectional feminism, and yet it falls into the same trap as liberal feminism."

Something along the lines of ""Erm, could we talk about the Caitlyn Jenner thing for a second? I think you know that it upset me, but at the time I didn't really have the composure to explain why. Do you mind if I give it a go now?"" Then don't be adversarial.

TBH, those sorts of comments, from my parents (and the comments were generally a fair bit worse, usually) and sometimes friends, kept me in the closet for longer than I wanted to be, and it made them have to earn my trust again, which took years.   Because really, folks don't know about trans-stuff. If they're in their mid-late 20s or older, I'm very aware that the culture they grew up in was intensely transphobic to the point where no one noticed it. Stigmas against trans people were seen as common sense or obvious. And most didn't hold seething hatred for trans people, they were just taught to think all the wrong things about us, repeatedly. That's not necessarily an excuse...if my socially oblivious and awkward roommate can spend 6 years living with me and interacting with me daily, without saying any terribly transphobic stuff (while not avoiding these issues either), then I think just about anyone is capable of doing the same, even if it takes a bit longer.   I would...advise against going to management just yet. Maybe that's my ""gay men react poorly to accusations of transphobia in their midst"" experiences conditioned into me, but I'd try to handle the individual folk first, with a brief explanation about specifically how it all makes you feel as a employee (try not to use ""you"", stick to how you feel, it'll help you get received better or at last ensure there's lower odds for a super defensive reaction).

Yeah, that would be weird, but that isn't what happens.  This person has a misunderstanding and based on it they are rightfully confused.  A quick ""well actually they always felt female...""

I'm not attracted to women. This would be a huge deal.    Yes, it would be a huge deal. And you're right ""sure, no biggie"" is probably a ridiculous answer. But its not like that's the only option. You could easily do a quick correction there too, and get them to shift their thinking.    ""I don't know if my marriage would survive something like this, but I know that I do love my husband enormously, and if my husband came home and explained to me that they'd been forced to bury who they were, for their entire life, it wouldn't be that simple. I'd probably feel lied to and betrayed, but I'd mostly be angry at a world that forced my husband to lie and hide every day of their life. And I'd respect how much it must have taken them to come out to me, and just how much trust and faith they were putting in me. And I'd try and understanding that everything I was going through was nothing compared to what my husband had been going through their entire life, and was still going through. I don't know how things would work out, but I love my husband for who he is, and if one day I discovered that my husband was a woman, I'd love her too. Maybe it would be a different kind of partnership or relationship, but we would figure something out.""    That's three possible ways to handle it, that can be used independently or together. They all shift the conversation. Saying just #1 does something important and shifts the picture of one where the wife is the victim to one where they remember the cost to the husband too, and remember that choosing to hide isn't about deception as much as preservation.  If they ask what you mean, or push back, then you can easily go into #2 and go into more detail. #3 can be used on its own, or following #1, or following #1 and #2 combined. And this is just what I came up with off the top of my head.   There are lots of ways to push back against a thoughtlessly bigoted statement other than ""s'cool, no biggie""   Basically I don't think either of these statements are ""transphobic"" but just ignorance in one and an most likely irrelevant worry in another. People are allowed to have questions and feelings around this.   Transphobia largely is a matter of ignorance. Transphobia doesn't mean ""I am actively choosing to hate this group of people because I am a bad/evil/whatever person"". People are allowed to have whatever feelings they want. Many of those feelings are transphobic though. Transphobia can be feelings, or actions. And if you have transphobic feelings, the first thing education does is teach you not to translate these into actions. The second thing it does is slowly reshape your feelings."

(though there was one day early on where the class was separated, the boys with a male teacher and the girls with a female teacher, so that they could answer questions students may have been too shy to ask in mixed company - the teachers could then also make sure that any of these questions/answers that they considered important were talked about in front of the whole class at some point, without singling out the one asking but so that everyone could be more informed.)

She knows I know about menstruation, the menstrual cycle, what she is going through, etc.  I know about her lady bits and I've always found the clitoris (it really isn't that hard to locate, look beneath/under the hood).

FemmeThoughts,39bghr,Shmaesh,11,Wed Jun 10 17:03:48 2015 UTC,There's a criticism in the comments that this study was funded by Mothercare. Does anyone (maybe in the UK) know what that is?   I have no idea how interpret the comment because I don't understand what they're referencing.
FemmeThoughts,39bghr,goodoldfreda,17,Wed Jun 10 18:47:22 2015 UTC,Mothercare is a company which sells formula milk. Them funding this study is a problem because they can basically keep doing studies on this sort of thing and only allow results which are favourable to be published. They can also mess with the methodology to make results more favourable. It's a serious issue among lots of companies. I suggest reading Bad Science and Bad Pharma if you want to know more about this sort of stuff.

FemmeThoughts,39bghr,Bacon_Bitz,3,Wed Jun 10 19:50:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a new""ish"" dad with a seven month old son.  He never breastfeed because of a cleft palate, but my wife pumped religiously six times a day for his first six months of life.  We're currently transitioning him to formula only so going through the milk my wife had frozen.  I'd like the article to look at this.  Is it merely bottle-fed babies end up less fussy or is it just formula fed babies?  I can't speak for breastfed babies, but our little man has always been happy and healthy and gained weight as he should.    From my limited experience (I only have the one son, but a couple nephews and friends) it seems like purely breastfeed babies eat just enough to not be hungry, whereas my son would finish a bottle.  We tried to give him a similar amount to what he would get breastfeeding, but since it was all there in a bottle, he may have eaten a little more than just enough.  By this thought, I could see breastfed babies perhaps being a little more vocal about being hungry because they need to eat more often while bottle-fed babies tend to eat a bit more.  I know formula tends to fill babies up more than milk, so I wonder if that might be a factor as well.  Regardless, all babies are different and will display differing temperaments, so...there's that."
FemmeThoughts,39bghr,generallyok,2,Wed Jun 10 19:28:43 2015 UTC,"That is interesting. I was also thinking the breast babies might be slightly more spoiled/coddled because of the mother having to hold it and be ""on tap"".  And perhaps a number of people who strictly breast feed also raise their children differently? Not all but enough to skew the numbers."
FemmeThoughts,39bghr,NameIdeas,6,Wed Jun 10 22:42:56 2015 UTC,"i don't think a young baby can be spoiled. babies are needy little creatures, inherently. formula does fill a baby up more though, and babies who are bottle fed will often eat until it's all gone, whereas they say breastfed babies will just eat until they're satiated. however, my little pig has certainly gorged himself on boob a few times."
FemmeThoughts,39bghr,seeingredagain,2,Sat Jun 13 12:00:17 2015 UTC,"I think the ""on tap"" comment makes sense.    I do wonder about a ""difference in raising"" that might contribute to the fold."

You're a feminist. There is no ""better feminist."" There is a better person.  Some people (feminists included) need to ditch their transphobia and become better people. If anyone should be a ""better feminist,"" it's them. It completely undermines gender equality to divide the line of ""female"" versus ""male"" by limiting gender to outdated mindsets.   I cannot understand what mental gymnastics they must go through to somehow justify their own self-negating belief by denying gender equality to trans people."
FemmeThoughts,393w22,CalicoFox,38,Tue Jun 9 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"The rift you might be referring to is perpetrated by a subset of Feminists who essentially believe that Trans women aren't women, and so they're ""trans exclusionary radical feminists"" (TERFS). We don't like those here, so you're safe with us, don't worry ^^  They use a lot of biological determinism, the stuff about brains and such. Don't listen to that, it's biological reductionism and it holds no water. Define your trans experience as you feel best, and you won't be hurting feminism in any way. Talk about your experiences to those who would listen and benefit from your account, your life is valuable and if you see someone going through something similar, by all means help them by empathising :3  As for dressing this way or that, please dress however your heart desires. Don't fall into the Liberal ""Choice"" Feminist trap that tells you that this decision or that decision is feminist or not, some decisions (like what to dress like) are not necessarily feminist and that's okay. The choices you think you have while under White Supremacist, Heteronormative, Capitalist Patriarchy, are in many ways already made for you. You have a very narrow margin in which to pick and choose, and you'll find it more significant—as you read and learn—to analyse the systems that oppress women through various axes.  As for what you can do... I would say that it's very important to read up on the theories, first and foremost. There are many feminists who support generic feminism, but when you ask them about Bell Hooks, Judith Butler or Angela Davis, they stare at you blankly.  In the case of Trans Feminism, Queer Theory and Gender Theory, I would definitely read Judith Butler (Undoing Gender and Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity) and Leslie Feinberg (Stone Butch Blues and Trans Liberation: Beyond Pink or Blue).  I'm certain you'll find that no one here will resent you. You're a beautiful person, considerate and thoughtful, and clearly very conscientious and aware.

We don't need to politicize everything that we do. Many women perpetuate a lot of harmful stereotypes about women and gender roles, and it's not suddenly a problem when trans people do it.  Further, about number 2, we've all suffered. But man is it not easy to be a trans woman. Cis women suffer, sure, but I can't imagine what trans women go through and I hope our sympathies are directed that way instead of demanding that they stay focused on us.  Don't pay any attention to TERFs and don't let them tell you how you should be defining your experience of womanhood. All of our experiences are different from each other and womanhood means different things to all of us. Find out what it means for you and stick to it."
FemmeThoughts,393w22,sillandria,8,Tue Jun 9 16:54:55 2015 UTC,"All the comments were talking about how trans women are always feminine   Said by those that aren't trans. There is immense pressure on us trans women to be feminine. We are constantly judged by cis standards of feminine beauty, and if we fail to conform we do not ""pass"" and faced increased discrimination and hatred. I am lucky in that I can pass fairly well, and my only awkward moments are trying to use the restroom in public, but not everyone can pass as well as me and we shouldn't expect trans women to have to conform to cis standards. Despite this, the cis standards are the normative ideal for women, cis or trans, meaning that we as trans women have to deal with constant judgement about our bodies and our makeup and our genitals every fucking day we wish to present as a woman and the easiest way to do so is by acting feminine. Those that blame us for that are privileged assholes that can not see past their own bias and realize the pressures that force us to act in certain ways or else our lives will be even more of a hell than they already are. We are not the problem; everyone else is and blaming trans women for acting feminine is just blaming the victim.   1) Is there a way to define my trans experience without hurting feminism? Many women seem upset with trans women claiming to have a female brain, I'm not sure even I believe it. But how else do I define why I'm trans?   Ultimately it is your choice how you define yourself. I tend to see myself as having been predisposed toward an identity as a woman, though I do not think that my gender identity is completely innate, rather it is a daily constructed entity whose meaning changes as I change as a person, never staying as one solid concept of ""woman"" yet never being alien to the idea of woman. Yeah, it is hard to explain, but that is how I feel about it. Yay, experiential identity!   2) How can I be respectful of the suffering that people assigned female at birth have gone through? Should I just stay quiet about my own experiences?   Realize that cis and trans people do have different experiences and just be respectful of that. Absolute understanding is not needed for solidarity.   3) I don't want to dress feminine because then people will think that I believe that being a women is just a certain set of stereotypes, but I also don't want to dress masculine all the time because I as an individual do not like doing that. So many women were offended with how Jenner portrayed herself, I don't want to set back the feminist cause by being too feminine or sexual. What can I do to reconcile stereotypes with how I like to dress on a daily basis?   Fuck the haters. Dress however you want and however makes you feel right. I dress feminine. I like skirts and makeup and wearing cute shorts and I am still a feminist. Femininity isn't inherently bad though sexist social norms tend to define it ins such a way as to be deficient in relation to masculinity. Besides, what is the alternative? Be masculine? Why the absolute fuck should we defer to the male standard? That seems like bullshit to me."

FemmeThoughts,393w22,sethg,20,Wed Jun 10 01:42:19 2015 UTC,"First off, Adahn gave a great answer. I'll totally fail to keep mine short because they covered a lot of ground.  The people you're concerned about appealing to here are transphobes. They're not interested in changing their minds, and they are not interested in listening to your lived experience. There are plenty of racist feminists. There are plenty of transphobic feminists. There are plenty of classist feminists.  They're failing here, not you. Their feminism is not intersectional, and that makes it bullshit.  1) Truthfully. Define yourself by what you experience.  2) Listen when it's appropriate, learn from experiences you don't share with other women, and talk when it's appropriate. If they're too shitty to learn from  you, it's not your failing.  3) You dress however suits you. The end. Your clothing choices may or may not be feminist choices, but you're not going to destroy feminism with your damn clothes, don't worry.    I just feel that there is a rift developing between a lot of feminists and the transgender rights movement(whatever that is).   That's just the TERFs getting louder and louder as they become fewer and fewer and less and less relevant. You see the same thing from super patriarchal men lately who are also panicking that they're losing hold of their control of culture. They're right to panic. They're becoming obsolete.    I'm scared that a lot of feminists may secretly resent trans people for daring to be feminists.   Not any feminist worth their salt. Again, don't worry about the ones who aren't coming. It was their choice to be shitty, and they have to live with it while the world moves on without their hate.  This was way longer than intended, sorry. I just feel so awful for the effect that article's had. I'm part of a very large trans group on facebook, as well, and the upset there* was heart-wrenching. I saw trans women saying horribly depressing things about how that fucking TERF might be right, and trying to brainstorm ways to minimize their splash in the world. Please don't do that. You're here, you're welcome and you're worthy. Anyone who rejects you or who tries to qualify terms of your welcome is fucking wrong.

FemmeThoughts,393w22,i_fake_it,11,Tue Jun 9 14:20:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, don't define yourself as a misogynistic woman. So don't pull a Christina Hoff Summers. But by being trans you are doing nothing to hurt the feminist movement. You don't owe it to anyone to define why you're trans. Most people I know would just accept ""Because I identify as a woman"" for when you explain that you are trans. Validating their experiences when you can, Listening when you cannot. When you want to talk about your own experiences go ahead! Just be polite, like you would anyone else. Dress as you want. Acknowledge that not every choice you make will be a feminist choice and that that's ok. As for reconciling stereotypes, all women do that and when you were male presenting you were doing it then too. Just find your own style.   TERFS suck, ignore them.

FemmeThoughts,393w22,hopefulgradstudent,3,Fri Jun 12 03:14:28 2015 UTC,"1) Is there a way to define my trans experience without hurting feminism? Many women seem upset with trans women claiming to have a female brain, I'm not sure even I believe it. But how else do I define why I'm trans?   A lot of sexism is justified by claiming that men and women are fundamentally different. You know, men are from mars, women are from venus. Men are good at math and logic, women are good at languages and empathy. That's why it's totally okay that women are underrepresented in politics and business and STEM and the media. In the eyes of most (if not all) feminists, this is a bunch of gender essentialist bullshit. This is why some feminists get wary when trans people talk about having a female or male brain.  However, from what I have seen, this is not what trans people mean when they say that. I once read a trans woman explaining her experience as being born with a male body but having a brain that expects a female body. In any case, I have yet to see any definitions of trans experience that hurt feminism (and I'm having a hard time imagining any). It is of course your right to define your experience any way you see fit and any feminist worthy of that title will accept it.   Should I just stay quiet about my own experiences?   God no. Trans women have an important place in feminism and their voices need to be heard. Having a different experience than cis women is precisely what makes you important to the feminist movement. Who else has first-hand experience at being (perceived as) both a man and a woman in our society?   I don't want to dress feminine because then people will think that I believe that being a women is just a certain set of stereotypes, but I also don't want to dress masculine all the time because I as an individual do not like doing that.   Here's the thing - you can't win. Cis women have the same problem, only it seems to be about a hundred times worse for trans women. Women are expected to be feminine and whether they are or not, they are punished for it. As a cis woman, if you're feminine, your vapid, superficial, dumb and unfeminist. If you're not feminine, you're unfuckable, manish, ugly and will die alone. (This may be the same for trans women, you'll have to tell me.) As a trans woman, if you're feminine you are propagating gender roles and stereotypes. If you're not feminine, well, you're not a prober woman, are you? Why did you bother transitioning? How dare you claim to be a woman while not acting like one?  Seriously, you cannot win. I don't blame Caitlyn Jenner one little bit. By presenting herself as hyper-feminine, she is more likely to be accepted as a woman. The problem is our sexist, transphobic society that refuses to accept less feminine trans women as women.   I don't want to set back the feminist cause by being too feminine or sexual   You can't do that. Gloria Steinem basically ended that debate forever.  Dress however you like, but do be critical of the social forces that influence you.   I'm scared that a lot of feminists may secretly resent trans people for daring to be feminists.   I sincerely think that most feminists don't. I think feminists and trans people are natural allies because a lot of the problems we are affected by have the same source."
FemmeThoughts,393w22,nightride,5,Fri Jun 12 10:27:11 2015 UTC,"On the gendered brain thing. ~*science*~  And seriously, fuck that terf noise. Any feminist movement which isn't also an ally of transfolk is garbage. :)"
FemmeThoughts,393w22,see996able,5,Tue Jun 9 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"I think the important thing to remember is that there are markers that can detect brain/biological sex mismatches. However, this way to differentiate the brains of men and women is not the same as what the popular media means when using the same term; ""male/female brain"" in the western media refers to stereotypical personalities and preferences. A common trope seen on reddit is that the female brain isn't logical and is poorly suited for STEM. I wonder if there's another way to word it. ""Brain with female identity?"""

No woman should have to put up with that kind of crap. We just talked about it on the Stewart-Jenner thing, on how since her transition her intelligence, her athleticism, all of it has been swept under the rug and instead now it's all about how she looks, what she wears, how old she is, what body-parts of hers look good, and whether or not she's sexually desirable."

Eta: it's a shame I can't post a question without being downvoted. It discourages discussion, and isn't that how people are enlightened to new ideas? But ok.    The reason you were down-voted, no doubt, is because you equated being unhealthy with being overweight. Unless you're Superman with x-ray vision, and even then I'd question Superman's ability, you can't tell if someone is healthy or unhealthy by sight alone.  To use an anecdote, I have an aunt who's skinny and seemingly fit as a fiddle. Her diet is full sugar sodas, cupcakes, and red meat. She's smoked every day since she was a teenager (and she's now in her 70s). She appears healthy, but isn't. On the other hand, in the same family, I have another aunt who's overweight, she jogs every single day, never smoked once, doesn't drink, and is a vegetarian.  When she goes to the doctor the nurses who take her blood pressure are surprised when they realised she doesn't suffer from hypertension or cholesterol, whilst my former aunt has the initial stages of type 2 diabetes.   her being a woman made her a more vulnerable target(? Not sure if there are overweight men in similar positions who weren't attacked)   Women are absolutely more bodyshamed than men are, no matter the position they're in, but particularly in this field. As for men, there's one or two that come to mind (like Chris Christie) but it's not a noticeable pattern. In fact very fat men are and have been appreciated without any commentary. Pavarotti, Dom De Luise, Kevin Smith, John Candy, just off the top of my head.  In fact, I'd even go as far as saying that some men are liked more when they are overweight. Pavarotti himself was criticised when he lost weight because everyone thought it just wouldn't be the same anymore, that his voice would change. When Seth Rogen lost weight and wasn't ""pudgy"" anymore, people didn't find him quite as funny anymore. And so on."

FemmeThoughts,38s16m,MeAndLazarus,2,Sat Jun 6 08:54:08 2015 UTC,"A reddit search mostly brought up misogynist discussions and reactions to this video (even in subs that are nominally feminist, such as /r/askfeminists), so I'm hoping posting here will create some actually enlightening discussion.  I, for one, think this newest video/site indeed makes valid points and demonstrates (through the comments section, for example) aspects of the rape culture we're part of, but I think someone like bell hooks would say that we shouldn't continue to create images of brutalized women in order to make these points. So, the cons might be outweighing the pros here. Is this a fair reaction?"
FemmeThoughts,38s16m,commanderspoonface,6,Sat Jun 6 08:58:36 2015 UTC,"I think someone like bell hooks would say that we shouldn't continue to create images of brutalized women in order to make these points.   I think this sentiment ties into the reaction that a lot of people, including myself, initially have to this project. That somehow it is morally wrong for her to use rape, including her own rape, in her art. While rape is unquestionably a societal issue, it's also a deeply personal experience, and when we try to use feminist theory to dictate to her how she can contextualize and interact with her own experience of rape in the creation of art, we would essentially be treating her as a member of a class rather than as an individual. Essentially enforcing a particular perspective and attitude in the interest of feminine solidarity.   So I think there are criticisms to be made (it's a college student's performance art piece, so that should not be surprising) I do think it would be incorrect to say that she shouldn't have expressed her feelings about rape and rape culture artistically."
FemmeThoughts,38s16m,helloiamsilver,10,Sat Jun 6 21:55:24 2015 UTC,"I'm glad this sub is discussing this. It's one of the few reasonable places for such things. I agree with your opinion. I am an artist myself and I know often artists make it their goal to use their own darkest or most unpleasant personal experiences in their art. If this project makes people doubt her experience because she shouldn't be so ""open"" about it she was truly assaulted, they clearly do not understand the brain of an artist. (Also it's ridiculous to expect every rape survivor to act exactly the same in order to be the perfect ""victim"").   I've also seen people say this is just a publicity stunt in order to gain attention. And to that I say, of course it is! That's the whole point of performance art. To get people to pay attention to this and think about and talk about rape culture in America. She wants  to stay in the public eye so that her experience  doesn't just fade away and become forgotten. She doesn't want to let the world forget how appallingly it treats victims of sexual assault.   This is of course, just my opinion but I wanted to get it out as I'm sick of reddit's rape apologist misogyny."

FemmeThoughts,38s16m,Retsejme,0,Sun Jun 7 04:11:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is the problem. You can't control people's reactions and talking about sexual assault causes a lot of people to go on the defensive. I was defending her motives, not the outcomes."
FemmeThoughts,38s16m,Retsejme,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:37:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely understand your point, which is why I started this thread. But I think there's a difference between a) the infinitely many other modes of expressing feelings about rape/culture in your art (like her other performance art thus far) and b) creating more products that are visually indistinguishable from rape fetish porn - which I think 99% of us would agree is dehumanising to women. I think the nuance that we as feminists appreciate in this piece is surely going to be lost on the almost undoubtably many many more misogynists that watch this video, often as porn.   It's an unfortunate truth, but I indeed think her personal interests in this particular instance (I'm NOT including her ""Carry That Weight"" performance art project in this category) might not be as important as the perpetuation of a rape culture that she could unwittingly be fuelling. I don't think one's personal expression is a trump card in all instances, though it's certainly important to take into account."

A lot of these are pretty standard, and number 9 applies more to acquaintances than friends.  Also I think a couple of the important ones they left out: depression and the  like (body image problems) can't be solved just by being a good friend. Same with body image problems: just because they're pretty doesn't mean they're happy with their body.  Also realize that 99% of what makes a woman have any worth to the outside world is her looks (this is true in queer circles too). So don't be surprised when trans women spend a lot of time on looks, because it's the line between being harassed everywhere you go and not.

FemmeThoughts,38j0o8,linguistrose,8,Thu Jun 4 15:21:39 2015 UTC,". 3. Call-IN vs. Call-OUT   I love this one in particular. I have very few friends who follow the ""call-in"" as opposed to the usual ""call-out"". The calling out is pretty hurtful, particularly because it's done in public, whether online or IRL and subsequently it causes a lot of hurt feelings and a possible falling out.  Calling in the person who screwed up, by taking them into your private confidence, and then explaining to them why what they said is wrong, is infinitely more beneficial. I don't know how many times /u/Capn_Blackbeard has saved me from making an ass of myself by messaging me in public about something dumb I've said.  Similarly, we've also had a terrible ""call out"" moment, which frayed both our nerves and tested our friendship. So yes, ""Call-In"" rather than ""call-out"" is what we should practice among feminist comrades, and ""Call-outs"" should be reserved for the reactionaries we fight against."

FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,linguistrose,86,Wed Jun 3 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"Ugh I banged my head on the desk because it's so true. One of my trans friends was telling me the other day that once she fully transitioned her outward appearance, she would indeed have to face the sexism, the dismissive comments about her intelligence, the objectification of her body (or let's face it, bodyparts) and the moral judgements on what she is on the ""prude-or-slut"" meter.  It goes to show that we cannot singularly champion Trans liberation or Gay liberation without also pushing for Women's liberation. There's no such thing as single-issue struggles because we do not live single-issue lives (stole that from Lorde). We need to continue fighting for women, and that fight needs to be relentless and uncompromising."

We can't talk about Women's Rights without talking about Black Rights, or Trans Rights, or First Nations Rights, or Able-ism, or Age-ism, etc. These topics are interconnected and cannot be understood in a vacuum or as separate issues."

I'm lucky enough that I'm not visibly trans and can go stealth at work, so people just see me as a cisgender woman. The frustrating thing is how people treat me, though. Male coworkers and bosses have a tendency to talk down to me like I'm stupid despite my having more experience than they do working with certain technologies. I also feel like I have a much harder time making industry standard wages and I'm held to different standards when communicating in emails. When I stick to just writing terse snippets of information regarding a work project, I'm being a bitch and not putting enough fluff in my emails, but if a man writes the same thing in the same way, it's perfectly okay. Ugh. And that's just a small piece of the whole picture of what it means to be a woman."
FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,annarchy8,29,Wed Jun 3 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"Being a woman in IT is a daily grinding down of a person. You are never good enough, just because you're a woman. You're not smart enough, just because you're a woman. Oh, did you get that degree because you have big tits? Yup, must be that because you're a woman. It's ridiculous, especially considering that the pioneers of computer language and development were mostly women! And it's kept me out of the field even though I would earn much more than I do now.

Yes, only in the narrow production margins that Capitalism allows, within the gender norms and roles Patriarchy allows, within the limitations on race that instituionalised Racism allows, and so on."
FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,annarchy8,19,Thu Jun 4 04:29:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. We are not free from social constraints and expectations and mores. Just as men are shackled by the same issues. MRAs are not able to grasp the concept well at all, though. Just because we can vote doesn't mean we're done and should be happy with our lot. It's the same with the LGBT community being told they should be happy they can get married in some states. That's not the only thing anyone's been fighting for. Marriage shouldn't even be a civil right! How about pay and housing equality??"
FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,ifeelcrazyyyyyy,8,Wed Jun 3 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"yah I am beginning to realize that actually (regarding your 'communist' tag), maybe capitalism is kind of a bad system that might be responsible for a lot of inequality.  Maybe humanity can abandon it soon in favour of something more humane."
FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,Adahn5,4,Wed Jun 3 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"Aye, it's why Feminism has adopted Anarchist or Marxist analysis and critiques of Capitalism as it considers it one of the big systems of oppression out there. It's one of the reason Bell Hooks talks about ""White Supremacist, Capitalist, Patriarchy"", rather than simply Patriarchy. If we did away with Patriarchy, women would still be oppressed on the basis of their class, their ethnicity, their sexual preference, etc.  Anarchism and Marxism in turn has also, by simple philosophical extension and necessity, adopted Feminism because of how sex and gender are often ""class in drag"" as Butch Lee would put it.  What's meant by that is that class composition is affected by existing oppressions such as misogyny or racism, and to imagine that the working-class is not co-determined by the pressure of sex, gender identity, sexual preference, etc, presupposes that the working-class is primarily cis, white, het and male.  Anyway I know quite a few Marxist-Feminists who arrived at Socialism/Communism through listening and reading the works of Silivia Federici like Caliban and the Witch there's also an interview here which includes a transcript where she talks about Capitalism and Patriarchy.  Edit: Since we're on the subject of Trans liberation, I thought I'd also leave this link to the great Leslie Feinberg's “Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come”. It's in PDF format through that link."

FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,Adahn5,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:47:27 2015 UTC,"IRL it's difficult because most people have either a skewed, propagandized version of what Socialism is (whether Marxist or Anarchist socialism) and the rest don't really know what it is except for some distorted, European nebulous concept that it's welfare and social safety nets.  Depending on where you are you might be able to make a meetups.com group, or start a club at your university, my recommendation would be to have the group/club be about Socialist literature (and you can further stipulate that it should be Feminist literature) so of the likes of Judith Butler, Silvia Federici, Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, Alexandra Kollontai, Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman, this way you can gather people who are similarly minded.  Online it's much easier because we have communities, especially here on Reddit, that cater to those crowds. So you have r/Communism that's exclusively Marxists. You have r/Anarchism which is of course for Anarchists, and you've got our sub: /r/CommunismWorldwide which is for both, and holds very strongly to Social Justice causes like LGBTQIA Liberation, Feminism, Anti-Racism, Environmental Justice, Animal Liberation, and so on.  r/Socialism is a bigger community than us by thousands, but I personally feel it's subject to the same kind of defaultification (and thus full of mansplainers, brocialists, manarchists and assorted MRAs masquerading as Socialists) that 2XC has suffered, and which is prominent in r/Feminism and r/AskFeminists.  So we've made r/CommunismWorldwide a safe place where we ban reactionaries on sight."

So, you know, it's a lot harder to reference a subreddit you don't want to drive traffic to without linking to it now.   There's no issue with your links, and I don't care if you leave them linked, but just in case you might like to know, if you do the single slash ones like this: 'r\/femmethoughts', it will show up as: 'r/femmethoughts' and won't link when you don't want it to."

FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,Adahn5,2,Thu Jun 4 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there is a way to do it anonymously   Absolutely. There's no reason why you have to create a meet-up group with your real name. And less of a reason to set it up someplace like your home. You can do it as a diner or at a coffee house, and use a fake name. I generally use my pen name, or my ""online name"" Yuri Lazariov when it comes to things like that. Coincidentally it's also the name I use when some website asks for my real name >.>   will starting a meetup group like that affect my career prospects if it is connected with me?   I don't think so.. I mean if you're just reading political, economic or philosophical literature, and you're plastering it all over your facebook and such, I think you should be safe.   I wonder if there are certain types of charities or social justice things that would attract other leftists, which I could get involved in?   Absolutely. You could join the Wobblies (Industrial Workers of the World), or you could look in to see if there's any local leftist organisations. I know that Austin has a Marxist-Leninist group, for instance. It depends on how big a place you live in, how cosmopolitan it is too.  As for Social Justice things that might attract other leftists, you could look at local Anti-Fascist groups that might have had rallies or marches in your area, as well as Anti-Racist groups. There are a lot of Black Solidarity and Liberation groups as of late that you may want to look into, often there's a Marxist undercurrent to those if they hold to the writings of Davis, Huey Newton and Malcolm X.   It's not easy, but we're out there x3"
FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,ifeelcrazyyyyyy,2,Thu Jun 4 23:04:32 2015 UTC,bah I was hoping that volunteering at a soup kitchen or something would do the trick haha.
FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,Adahn5,2,Thu Jun 4 23:15:43 2015 UTC,"You might, but odds are relatively low. You might find some Christian Socialists there, but yeah I wouldn't put much stock in it. The reason being Socialists (at least of the historical materialist variety) don't always support charities or volunteering because they're acts that keep the system going.  The reason for it is set forth in Oscar Wilde's ""The Soul of a Man Under Socialism"":   The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism – are forced, indeed, so to spoil them. They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation. It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this. The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man’s intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought. Accordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.   So it isn't that we should be against charity. In an abstract sense it's better than nothing. But society would be much better served by changing the conditions that cause the misery we struggle to fix, like a doctor curing a disease, rather than treating the symptom."

FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,shinosai,9,Wed Jun 3 19:21:55 2015 UTC,"That's true but being a satire isn't a defense against any criticism. Colbert's satire came at a time when there wasn't really much or any positive representation of trans people in his field. Colbert's satire is famously mistaken for sincerity. Put it together and I think even many liberal viewers were laughing along with his transphobic satire for the wrong reasons. And he is especially committed to his character, almost never breaking the act, so there's no way to get an out-of-character statement that sets the record straight.   Colbert doesn't have to believe the things his character says to be doing real and reckless harm. Was his satire challenging the status quo or reinforcing it? Hard to say, but if enough of his viewers had never been exposed to an alternative, it looks grim."
FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,prosthetic_ass_farts,2,Wed Jun 3 20:12:48 2015 UTC,"""Villain characters"" are typically recognizable as villains.

Most celebs, though, tend to apologize and don't actually get it, which is why they tend to reoffend, or make ""I'm sorry you got upset"" style apologies, or ""I didn't mean it that way, I love all my gay fans"" remarks. Usually celeb apologies are PR moves, not genuine apologies, and it's usually very easy to tell the genuine ones from the ones that were forced by their agents/publicists."
FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,fyrenwater,6,Wed Jun 3 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"Does it matter? If an apology is contingent on whether it will be accepted, it is not contrite. People should want to apologize for their own sakes if they've done something pretty bad and later have a change of heart."

FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,softinseattle,13,Thu Jun 4 03:50:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like comparing him to someone who made an insensitive joke one time isn't fair. He's been on the Daily Show for over a decade and made many, many, many jokes about trans women. Beyond that, the way he acts influences a huge amount of people because of the visibility of his show.   It is a little bit bit different for Uncle Bob to tell a transphobic joke to five of his friends versus Jon Stewart reaching MILLIONS of households with a transphobic joke.   For the average person, no, I don't think such a public apology is necessary, but he's not an average person."
FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,shinosai,11,Wed Jun 3 20:21:52 2015 UTC,"Jon Stewart (and Stephen Colbert) has been making transphobic remarks and jokes on his show since it began. Usually 6-12 a year, from minor jokes/remarks, to more blatantly offensive ones.  And yeah, it'd be great if he's changed and seen the light, but I want proof. I want a few years of him not fucking it up before I even begin to consider him supportive of trans people. or some sort of apology, even if it's inside of some interview question, or editorial, one that shows he's learned from his mistakes.   I just want proof that he's getting better, and since he was very loud an obnoxious about his transphobia before, I do expect him to be vocal about his changed opinions."

FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,Adahn5,32,Wed Jun 3 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"While so many people I know are praising Jon Stewart for this 'brilliant' deduction, I find this entire segment problematic and in some ways offensive.    Jon Stewart has a history of making transphobic jokes. Given the status of the show, he is responsible for having harmed trans people and it almost feels like he's being opportunistic here to turn around and act supportive without addressing his past. One (of many) examples:    “Here’s a general rule of thumb I have: if you don’t know whether you’ve made a particular mistake more or less than 50 times, that’s not really a mistake. At that point, it’s something you do.  For instance, how many times have I accidentally picked up a tranny hooker at a truck-stop? I want to say it’s in the 50s, but it could be higher. I guess what I’m saying is I’m nearsighted?”   Jon Stewart, like the media he is criticizing, sensationalizes her transition. ""Caitlyn, when you were a man, we could talk about...  but now you're a woman."" The phrase ""used to be man"" is extremely prevalent within the media whenever speaking about trans women, and this kind of sensationalism is not helpful.   The phrase ""welcome to being a woman"" is also a problematic phrase. Many times, it has also been uttered to me and it has always been in reference to something negative about the experience of a woman, usually to invalidate my complaints. For example, if I were to ask why women's pants don't have pockets, a common response is, ""Welcome to being a woman."" It bothers me when people say this, because it feels like my complaint is no longer valid, and the focus comes back to ""Hey, you're a woman now! See how much it sucks?"" The context of this phrase is nearly always the same in that regard -- it's a very negative one that also subtly undermines trans identities... let us remind you once again that you weren't a woman before and take away the focus of a legitimate feminist issue. I think the focus of the segment, complaining that the media sexualizes women, is a bit of a misdirection. She did a photoshoot and you expect the media to not talk about her appearance? That's literally what models do. She made that choice; it wasn't an accident.  There is a much bigger issue at play here and that is Caitlyn Jenner's privilege as a wealthy individual. Most trans women do not have access to healthcare or the resources to make a successful transition in the way that Caitlyn Jenner within a few months. Instead of latching on to such an easy talking point (omg women are being judged for their appearance) I feel like he could have talked about the ways that Caitlyn's transition is so extremely unrepresentative of what most trans women can achieve because of healthcare and job discrimination.    I am glad Jon Stewart is supportive, I just think he could have done a better job of showing that support."

I use ""welcome to being a woman"" or some variant all the time, never in a conversation with a trans* person. It is definitely a sarcastic remark about how, yes, this is the standard (lack of pockets, catcalling, periods,  whatever) that for most women, it's nothing new or surprising, isn't that unfortunate?    here is a much bigger issue at play here and that is Caitlyn Jenner's privilege as a wealthy individual. Most trans women do not have access to healthcare or the resources to make a successful transition   This is definitely the bigger issue. Jenner has a supreme amount of privilege.

It must piss the crap out of Trans women to hear that. ""You used to be a man""—""No you tremendous sack of shit, I was never a man"".

FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,tganon123,17,Wed Jun 3 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"Well, it varies from person to person. Honestly, I did used to identify as a guy. My point isn't necessarily that ""I was never a man"" but that putting such a major focus on our identity prior to transition is sensationalizing our stories. Some trans people do feel like they were always women, though, and that is also legitimate."
FemmeThoughts,38e0oo,AmazinglyAudrey,8,Wed Jun 3 21:17:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing that out. It's really easy to lump experiences into this one big thing, and I probably would have assumed the same thing Adahn just did if I hadn't really thought about it.  But on the phrase: The fact that it varies from person to person is all the more reason not to say that ""you used to be a man"" when there's no evidence that that's the case. It makes the mistake of generalizing AND sensationalizing the transition all at once."

True, but Caitlyn Jenner has also only physically transitioned. A lot of people are talking about her transition as though it has come and gone, but I don't think she hasn't even come close to being fully transitioned emotionally, psychologically, or socially yet."

If someone becomes more aggressive after you reject their catcalls, I think the best thing you can do is call the cops. If they are doing insane things like chasing you with their car, chances are you're not the first person it has happened to.   For me honestly I just walk away and try to act like it doesn't affect me. I can't educate them because they don't respect me to begin with.

But really, I think only a widespread organized effort could actually get men to collectively respect women's boundaries and autonomy, thus eliminating our shitty two choices in these situations.

FemmeThoughts,38exq5,discworldian,9,Wed Jun 3 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"There is quite a bit of judgement on how other women choose to respond (or not) to catcallers.   Catcalling is harassment. It is a crime.   If a person being catcalled chooses to respond with grace, even though the asswipe doesn't deserve it, that is a valid response.   If they lash out and scream and yell, that is a valid response.   If they choose to ignore it, that is a valid response.   The problem is not how we respond to catcallers."

FemmeThoughts,38exq5,annarchy8,19,Wed Jun 3 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"It's true that, depending on the place and time, people of any gender are vulnerable to crime. But when you're a victim and a woman, the response to a crime is having the people around you blame you for letting your guard down. You shouldn't have been out alone at that time, you should have known that men who commit crimes would act like animals to a woman, and so on. Men on the other hand are called dumb sometimes, yeah, but are ultimately considered unlucky or in the wrong place at the wrong time. I think a life of that narrative begins to weigh on you to the point of changing one's behavior to escape blame when things go wrong. It sucks. I really want to go run along Lake Michigan at sunrise, but it's too dangerous to be out when nobody else is."

This crap happens everywhere. I have found that how I respond to catcalling depends heavily on where I'm going. I don't drive, so I take the bus and walk a lot. If I'm headed to work, I ignore completely just for expediency. I don't want to waste my time and be late because I went off and got chased or whatever. If I'm not in a hurry, I have been known to yell back things like ""shut the fuck up"", ""I don't need you to tell me I look good"", etc. A couple of times, it was coming from a car that slowed down to follow or drive next to me. On those occasions, I stopped and yelled at the person catcalling. I was talking on my cell while walking when that happened once and asked the person I was on the phone with to hold, turned to the person in the car and asked ""do you not see I am on the phone?"" loudly and the car sped off.   I never say thank you. I never smile. I really do not want to encourage that behavior."

But it should probably be noted that I'm male, so it's not unlikely I'm just not aware of it here.  However if you're dedicated to brute force a better reaction to catcalling, I'd suggest to at first react how they would likely want you to react (i.e. thanking them, showing appreciation) to try and prevent them from getting defensive (or apparently even aggressive) about it. After this you can tell them what's really on your mind. This approach works pretty well in arguments and I'm interested if this can increase you're chances to actually reason with them.  If you're only interested in getting them off your back without making a (positive) difference (what I feel is totally understandable in a such a situation), I think something like ""Thanks, I'll let my boyfriend/fiance know"" could work."
FemmeThoughts,38exq5,DrHackenstein,3,Thu Jun 4 07:26:46 2015 UTC,"My wife (we live in Hamburg Germany) got chased a couple of times after leaving the U-Bahn (even after telling them she is going to meet her husband now). And there were also many other very uncomfortable situations for her like a man sitting in the bus sliding a ring up and down his middle finger while smirking at her. When we lived in a smaller town it was not that bad, but there were also some situations.  ""As a man"" I was groped once on a party by an unknown person. I don't know if it was ""by accident"" but I still felt in some way ""dirty"" and down the entire evening. I think this gave me a very small glimpse of how vulnerable you can feel as ""sexual prey"" to random strangers.  As a man maybe you can relate more to this feeling when you get targeted by a group of dangerous looking male adolescents who aggressively bark: ""Was guckst Du?"" How do you react to that? Especially when those guys begin to chase you... hey they just want to prove their maleness...  Communicating with unknown strangers is really hard... You don't know anything about your counterpart, you cannot anticipate their reactions. That makes it a very risky and complex task especially in such ugly surprise situations. I am afraid there is no best strategy for that."

I posted a great response piece I found online from a British feminist foundation to twox and some mod deleted it almost immediately because ""stories about male domestic violence aren't really appropriate here."" It was such a perfect piece for the antagonizing going on in the comments on the other article (and was about domestic violence in general, not just men), so that's when I realized the mods aren't really interested in keeping peace there -- they are encouraging the new twox as it is, and I don't know why."

It's up to the mods to enforce standards of practice and commenting, and I know that there may be some TwoX mods that are struggling to do this. But that one quote by a TwoX co-founder in this interview about the state of /r/blackladies indicates to me that their mod status is less of a responsibility than a role."

FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,albatrawesome,30,Wed Jun 3 14:45:16 2015 UTC,What the fuck is up with Reddit and its obsession with false rape claims??? I unsubscribed from TIL the other day because at least twice every week the highest up voted TIL was something about a woman making a false rape claim.
FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,lacaminante,27,Wed Jun 3 18:19:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize how incredibly afraid men are of being falsely accused of rape until I took my 1L criminal law class. Even my friends, self-described feminist men, would not back down on how big of a problem false rape claims were. It's mind-boggling to be because I personally know NUMEROUS women who have not reported being raped because the whole reporting process is very traumatic. Rape is one of the most under-reported crimes. Even very reasonable men seem to get totally caught up on their fear of false reporting rather than viewing it as a relatively infrequent aberration in a pattern of under-reporting."
FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,interiot,9,Wed Jun 3 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's the same reason that SRS-prime gets so much negative attention — when someone's shameful behavior gets pointed out, a lot of people's reaction is to shoot the messenger.  I'm a trans woman.  Back when I had a lot of testosterone in my blood, back when I didn't completely understand consent, I did some shameful things.  Not rape, but pretty shameful."
FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,gogogadgetpants_,3,Wed Jun 3 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"I personally know NUMEROUS women who have not reported being raped because the whole reporting process is very traumatic.    Not to mention some women start the process and then drop out because of stress and trauma. They are frequently counted as ""false"" despite being quite legit. It's crazy! If I found my wallet was missing and reported it to the police, but later discovered a family member took it and decided to drop the charges rather than prosecute them and cause drama at the reunion, that's not a ""false robbery."" I'd still be out a wallet, without justice."
FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,albatrawesome,8,Wed Jun 3 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"I understand not wanting to be falsely accused of a crime. Obviously, no one wants that. I think men find it difficult to empathize with a rape victim and find it easier to emphasize with someone being falsely accused of rape."
FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,lockedge,11,Fri Jun 5 17:05:10 2015 UTC,"And a lot of them think if they're falsely accused, that their lives will be over. Which...well, there may be some truth to that, perhaps, but every single person I know who has come forward with allegations of rape...their rapists ended up walking. They had been named. They're still loved in the community and by their friend groups. I don't believe any of them lost their jobs. There would the occasional person who would look at them funny, or whatever, but their lives went back to normal very quickly from what I can tell. Maybe in the most high profile of cases where public opinion somehow manages to be on the victim's side for once, there might be long lasting effects. But for your every day rape charge/allegation? From what I've seen, and from what my family friends in the police force have told me...not much at all, if anything.  Women who claimed to have been raped, and whose cases didn't end in conviction? Most of them still deal with being called liars, and all sorts of misogynistic slurs, and a lot of the friend groups kind of split up. I know it's all anecdotal, but I just have a hard time sympathizing with men who get terrified of false rape claims. it sucks to get accused of something you didn't do, but I haven't once seen lasting negative fallout from it."
FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,so_srs,7,Wed Jun 3 18:18:26 2015 UTC,"I mean, this dude claims to have gotten a prestigious scholarship for being a violent rapist. Not even an accused one, he pleaded guilty. His jail sentence was to work at the internship he was going to work at anyway, with the sentence delayed so he could finish his semester.  Really seems to have negatively affected his life."
FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,mara_jade,14,Wed Jun 3 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"There was a very enlightening This American Life podcast that discussed this recently. I believe it's called ""The Birds and the Bees"". Coed college students took a voluntary course discussing sex and consent. The instructor kept getting sidelined by men asking about specific sexual scenarios like ""what if we are both drunk?"" And ""what if we are already having intercourse and she wants me to stop?"" The instructor said ""well it doesn't matter what the situation is. No means no. If she says no then you do not have consent to continue."" The students were baffled by her answers. It really proved that we need to have more discussions about sex, rape, and consent in modern society. I think the high rate of rape that occurs on college campuses (and elsewhere) proves that we should be educating young people about what having consent means."

Seriously though, I mainly go to TwoX now when I wan't to get angry as well, as the majority of comments are still pretty awful. Obviously not everyone has to agree with the Feminist stance on issues, but seeing all that MRA crap and especially all these very male perspectives dominating conversations that should be for women, it's quite stressful for me."
FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,miscreantpossum,5,Wed Jun 3 09:41:19 2015 UTC,"all that MRA crap and especially all these very male perspectives dominating conversations that should be for women   This is what bugs me the most. Honestly, in that kind of context, if someone said something that I didn't agree with, I would be much less upset if the poster was a woman. As a white person, I don't go into subs intended for people of color and start arguing about why I disagree with their experiences or views of things that I have no firsthand experience with.  I've never understood the kind of mindset that makes people think that's an acceptable thing to do. If you're in an open forum and you start doing that, you're probably kind of a jerk anyway, but whatever. But to actually go into a place specifically intended for a group of people to talk amongst themselves, share personal experiences, and get away from that kind of thing... that's a whole new kind of douchebaggery."

FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,borahorzagobuchol,9,Wed Jun 3 21:45:57 2015 UTC,"I was also excited when TwoX was becoming a default. It was one of my favorite subreddits at the time, and I thought that becoming a default would bring more awareness of women's issues and perspectives to the bulk of reddit. Apparently we think too highly of your average redditor. I only go there when I feel like being outraged. Frankly that subreddit being ruined sometimes makes me want to quit reddit altogether, I just don't know where else to go. I've unsubbed from most default subreddits due to misogyny or racism."
FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,Adahn5,6,Wed Jun 3 14:30:56 2015 UTC,"I quit reddit five years ago when the MRAs used to regularly and openly brigade other subs and downvote dissenting opinion, just about ruining every sub I was subscribed to at the time by constantly pushing the same anecdotal stories, downvoting anything that disagreed with the narrative, and blatantly ignoring the big picture.    I came back about a year later with a different name so I wouldn't be stalked by some of the more fervent among them.  I've noticed that, as reddit adapted to outright brigading, their strategies have simply become more complex.  Unfortunately, the MRAs have clearly won over a lot of the on-the-fence audience on default reddit who were formerly simply ignorant of feminism and now actively regurgitate demonstrably false or misleading information.  I don't think there is another place quite like reddit, so I mostly just do what you were saying, stick to smaller subs where the population is already dedicated to intersectionality and ending oppression, thus eliminating the ground in which sexism and racism in the guise of ""equality"" to take hold."
FemmeThoughts,38bzoa,Elaine_Benes_,17,Wed Jun 3 20:28:56 2015 UTC,"Reddit is predominantly the space of young, white, cishet males from the Global North. They hold a ton of reactionary tendencies and considering that at their age they circlejerk with male friends in school, circlejerk with male friends in college and circlejerk with their MRA, PuG and GG communities online; it only serves to reinforce this kind of fucked up ""nesting"" mentality where they're absolutely blinded to their privilege, reinforce their misogyny, racism, homophobia and transphobia.  I'm glad you joined us, OP. It's areas like these who fight against the defaultification and thus reactionary tendencies existing on Reddit, that make going online a pleasant experience again."

I got to yoga really early and was sitting my car (dressed for yoga) with the door cracked open for maybe ten minutes. Some dude(s) makes a comment about my appearance. I don't even remember what it was anymore, but something like ""you look sexy"". I got out of the car and said ""Does that work for you?"". He looked really surprised that anyone would actually respond to his comments. ""Does it work for you to make comments on the appearance of women you don't even know? Like, has anyone agreed to go out with you afterward?""   He tried to say something about how his friend is just socially awkward and doesn't know how to talk to women. I kept walking toward him (I was going that way anyway) and saying how strangers don't need to know your opinion about their appearance, and I don't actually care if you think I look good or not.   He was surprisingly not defensive about it. I hope it made him think."

I was at my local grocery store checking out, and the bag boy kept hounding my cashier for her phone number and telling her she was beautiful. She was just ignoring him and trying to ring my groceries up. Finally, I turned to him and was like ""she can't give you her number, because then I'd have it and I'd call and harass her all the time.""    Mostly I was just trying to make a joke to distract him, but it worked for her, because she turned to him and said very firmly ""You can't ask for my number or talk to me like that at work.""    It was pretty awesome."
FemmeThoughts,3857c9,lockedge,2,Tue Jun 2 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"Hey that was pretty smart ^^ And you're right, it did serve as a joking way of disarming him, and arming her so as to dismiss the harassing little bugger."
FemmeThoughts,3857c9,coreythestar,6,Wed Jun 3 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"Here's my story (I made an edit at the bottom as well).  I went grocery shopping at Wal-Mart today and saw a cashier woman being harassed by a male customer. The circumstances, apparently, were that the cashier had told the man, who was waiting along with his wife and a cart full of groceries, that she would open her checkout lane in ten minutes.  It didn't take ten minutes, it took around fifteen and the man got upset. He went up to her and called her ""patána"", which in Spanish is the equivalent of lout/oaf/rube or clod. He went at it, loudly and continuously, repeating that word not once, or twice, but—I counted—nine times to her face over the span of 5 minutes which in real life... is a pretty long time when you're just standing around.  The entire time she was saying she was sorry, she had her head down, and kept passing items through the scanner one by one. The bag boy said nothing, her co-workers said nothing, primarily (I later asked why) because to intervene would have meant getting fired. They told me that they weren't allowed to even talk back to customers, and so there was nothing they could do.  At any rate, I was in the lane right next to the one where this was happening and I yelled at the man ""that's enough!""  It had been a while (last time I actually interjected myself into any conflict was a year ago or so) and so I got a little nervous because the guy easily had forty pounds on me. He was middle-aged, well-groomed, dressed business-casual.  Anyway he tried to ignore me and turned back his attention to the woman scanning away his groceries. I spoke up again and said ""Would you tell her the exact same thing if she were a man?""  That definitely pissed him off because he turned around and said. ""Come over here and I'll say it to you.""  At that point I felt those familiar feelings of adrenaline where you get a little sweaty and your heart starts pounding, and your hands and feet get cold.  ""Fucking say it to me, then!"" I said.  ""Patán!"" he yelled at me.  He made no move to come near me but our stares remained locked.  ""Does that make you feel better?""  ""No because my problem isn't with you. It's with her. Stay out of my business, this is none of your concern!""  His body language changed at that point. He crossed his arms over his chest. Mine were at my sides the entire time.  ""It is my concern when you're badgering a person who can't defend themselves!""  The whole time we were yelling at each other, pretty loudly to cut through the din of shoppers and such around us. Security never showed up, we just had a lot of nervous cachiers, bag people and shoppers staring at us. The man waved me away dismissively with his forearm after what I said and started turning around. I relaxed just a bit because I figured he had no desire to fight.  ""It's none of your business!"" He said.  ""Neither is it yours, you've no right to pick fights with people who can't fight back. You're ignorant!""  This whole back and forth happened in Spanish, so I'm translating things literally.  In any event he had his bags and, along with his wife who was pulling at the cart and saying things to him that I couldn't quite hear, he walked away.  The woman next to me, who had come before me and stayed to witness the whole thing despite having a cart full of bagged, payed-for groceries, said:  ""If the girl made a mistake he should have just taken her name down, lodged a complaint and left it at that.""  ""Yeah..."" I said. Still a little wound up.  After that I paid for my groceries. The cashier who had been on the receiving end of the guy's tirade mouthed ""thank you"" to me, and I fidgeted nodded and then went on my way.  It felt good to have done that. I figure the guy, even if he didn't or doesn't change his tune, I at least caused him some discomfort. He didn't walk out feeling the victim, or that because no one spoke up, their silence was equivalent to approval of his behaviour or the things he was telling her. I feel relatively certain that he would not have yelled at the face of a male cashier. But the fact that she was a woman, dark skinned (most likely of indigenous background), and young in appearance, fueled him to keep badgering her over and over.  Anyway that was just what I went through.  Edit: A good friend of mine said to me that I was wrong to have intervened. That the fact that I did and said that she couldn't defend herself as if she had no agency of her own is problematic. What I did might have momentarily helped, but it wouldn't do anything when the next guy that harasses her and there's no one to step up. Even if management didn't want for the employees to talk back to the customer, she should have called one of the managers to come and handle it. It's standard procedure after all.  I don't feel quite as good now to have done what I did. I figure I'll go apologise to her next time I go there."
FemmeThoughts,3857c9,LordLeesa,4,Mon Jun 1 23:01:03 2015 UTC,"imagine how fast hers must've been   Thinking about it now, I'm sure it must have been racing. I think about what my friend told me, about the procedure, and I consider now that maybe it wasn't even on her mind; or if she had it would have made the guy angrier. It's speculation, of course.  Thank you too for doing something. I've seen so many videos of social experiments, seen so many headlines about people being assaulted, of being raped, and of course these are way ahead of anything that happened in either of our stories, but those horrors start somewhere... and with so many bystanders or passersby who walk on and ignore it; even though I do over-think it, I don't regret doing what I did.  Thank you also for saying so. It makes me feel a little easier that I at least did the best I could out of a crummy situation."
FemmeThoughts,3857c9,LordLeesa,7,Tue Jun 2 04:22:02 2015 UTC,"I hate when customers get mouthy like that. It's wrong for them to take their impatience and immature temper tantrums out on those who aren't paid nearly enough to deal with that.   I think you did good, but my own biases might be at play. I've worked for two walmarts in my life, and in one of them, workers were punished for calling managers to help. The store was understaffed, our store owner was never around, and the managers hated being pulled away from whatever they were doing to help anyone. Three strikes in a month and you got terminated.  I was young and naive enough to test that policy and got canned.   I've worked other retail jobs where going to managers more often than deemed acceptable (which could be anywhere from one to five or more times a month) earned some severe negative marks on monthly performance appraisals for a 'lack of independent ability'. So...if I try putting myself in that worker's shoes, I know I wouldn't have called a manager over. I would have probably kept my head down, did my job, and tried to ignore the raving of a 5 year old in a 40 year old's body. And if someone stepped in to take some of that pressure off of me,  would have been grateful.  That's just me, though."

Granted, lots of blog recipe posts aren't that useful...and that's okay, if they don't work for me I don't use them. I don't particularly care if a blog includes a family story.

This is just an entire asshole parade, not normal people having a normal opinion and sharing it via a normal conversation.  Also, I'm willing to bet it got brigaded by some misogynist subreddits. People who are constantly making delicious baked goods in a traditionally woman-dominated hobby? Pretty sure a loud minority are that angry and strawmanly misogynist.

It's ""why wasn't I consulted"" syndrome. Someone is posting recipes in a blog form? I hate anything in a blog form, what the hell are they doing? Someone who posts recipes is a mom and discusses in their posts how the recipe works and is useful in their daily life? I hate moms and I hate kids, why the fuck are they talking about this? Someone is making a ""no bake"" recipe? I hate no bake recipes, just make the real thing or skip it altogether the way I would. Why the fuck are you making things I don't want to eat?  The concept that people out there have anything that differentiates from them in any way astounds them. This includes but is not limited to:   amount of time equipment and space expertise allergies diets food taste number of people being cooked for budget ingredient availability ingredient / finished product longevity meal/event being prepared for layout preferences   It's a big fucking internet out there, and not everything was written and created with you in mind. If you read it, and you don't like it, then don't make it and move the fuck on. I frequently look up recipes, and find a buttload of results that I don't want to make. Sometimes that's something that stays the same...sometimes that differs. A recipe that might be perfect for me if I'm planning in advance, is the absolute wrong thing when I'm trying to make something spur of the moment with what I have on hand and I'm actively looking for weird kitchen hacks to attempt.  Anyway, so you've got WWIC syndrome on overdrive. Then you add a superiority complex.    Anyone who bakes because they have to, not because they want to make better food is inferior. Anyone who looks for shortcuts and doesn't do the full thing - inferior. Anyone who bakes to feed a family, and not because they have a hobby / passion / career - inferior. Anyone who sacrifices taste for any other concern - inferior.   Well, a lot of those things intersect in motherhood. This is especially an issue, because there are a tonne of recipe collection sites that pick up recipes from blogs and elsewhere, so if you search for a recipe, you might regularly run into ""mommy recipies"". If you're annoyed by people doing things on the internet without you in mind, you're going to be especially annoyed when you keep running into them.  Mix that all together, and in a few liberal heapings of misogyny and you've got yourself quite the explosion.  Oh no, look at that, I put a recipe into a blog form. And I spent all this time explaining and stuff too, clearly I'm a part of the problem :D"

So I was a little surprised that no one engaged with it.  It's important to understand these things, rather than let ourselves be swept by the moment with no analysis.  There are too few questions on why LGBTQ people should participate in patriarchal nuclear family structures instead of overturning them.

I find it troubling that the only way that society thinks that it can accept non-straight people is by allowing them the ""privilege"" of acting like straight people. Why must we accept this as a huge step towards ""acceptance"" when it just reinforces compulsory heterosexuality? ""Sure your love is legitimate, but only if we can pigeonhole it into a frame that makes sense to straight people."" Heterosexual love is still the norm and non-straight oppression will still be a problem. If anything, we will get people trying to claim that they can't possibly be homophobic because they support marriage equality and treat non-straight people ""equally"" just like people today do with sexism. I think that marriage equality does show a more accepting society, but the reason why it is seen as such a huge step towards acceptance is because compulsory heterosexuality is so engrained in our social norms that it is necessary to legitimize love, which I think is bullshit."

I agree it's bullshit that it's necessary to legitimize love, but at the same time, I wouldn't go so far to say it quite ""reinforces compulsory heterosexuality"".  Like it or not, it is a huge step towards acceptance. It's all relative. Would you rather the general population voted to accept gay marriage - problematic though the marriage institution still may be - or that they lynched gay people in the streets?

Marriage is an institution that is oppressive to the primary care giver and sustains the exploitative mode of production we have under Capitalism.  From Friedrich Engel's ""Origin of the Family"":   With the herds and the other new riches, a revolution came over the family. To procure the necessities of life had always been the business of the man; he produced and owned the means of doing so. The herds were the new means of producing these necessities; the taming of the animals in the first instance and their later tending were the man’s work. To him, therefore, belonged the cattle, and to him the commodities and the slaves received in exchange for cattle. All the surplus which the acquisition of the necessities of life now yielded fell to the man; the woman shared in its enjoyment, but had no part in its ownership. The “savage” warrior and hunter had been content to take second place in the house, after the woman; the “gentler” shepherd, in the arrogance of his wealth, pushed himself forward into the first place and the woman down into the second. And she could not complain. The division of labor within the family had regulated the division of property between the man and the woman. That division of labor had remained the same; and yet it now turned the previous domestic relation upside down, simply because the division of labor outside the family had changed. The same cause which had ensured to the woman her previous supremacy in the house – that her activity was confined to domestic labor – this same cause now ensured the man's supremacy in the house: the domestic labor of the woman no longer counted beside the acquisition of the necessities of life by the man; the latter was everything, the former an unimportant extra.   It is an institution that ought to be dismantled, not asked to be joined. Just like the military, just like laws for the police force, etc. ""I want the same right as you to oppress other the people, or be oppressed"" is not equality, it's assimilationist heteronormative bullshit.  Gays and Lesbians deserve better than to be coerced into behaving like heterosexuals and assimilated into the heteronormative, conservative institution of marriage. We're talking about abolishing marriage as an economic, legal unit. Not as an amorous, social one.  Cultural acceptance should be divorced from the economic and legal benefits of forming a marriage as the only way of legitimising your relationship in the eyes of the law. Fuck the law and the system that brought it about. We all deserve the benefits marriage gives without the need to create a legally binding document in order to validate and justify your relationship.

This was the type of marriage your Engels quote was referring to.  The thing is, in the more liberal parts of the West (particularly Northwestern Europe), marriage is taking on a different meaning:    Culturally, it's now seen as optional, as opposed to a near-as-damn compulsory institution. This is particularly true for women, especially compared to the past, or other contemporary cultures. Secondly, it's treated primarily as an expression of love, and more often than not, a meeting of equals . Often both partners work and contribute financially. Both share child-rearing duties (even more so with the wave of Paternity Leave legislation). There is no ""exchange"" within many of these married relationships, only collaboration.   This isn't idealism: this is realism. This is the reality of many couples living in the liberal parts of the West today.  So, on to gay people. Regardless of marriage's cultural origins, denying gay people the option to express their love through the contemporary liberal Western conception of marriage is unfair and inherently discriminatory.   Again, this is cultural realism: regardless of how marriage should or shouldn't be, it's an option that was forbidden to gay people in Ireland until a few days ago.   Not only that, the overwhelming support for gay marriage in Ireland shows just how accepting Irish culture now is of homosexuality. That in itself is an achievement. If only Uganda were to vote to legalize gay marriage! Or Saudi Arabia! How much better the world would be.  Given all this, I'm celebrating the fact that gay Irish people can now choose to express their love through marriage. And I'm proud of the fact."
FemmeThoughts,37lfb7,Adahn5,26,Thu May 28 14:03:15 2015 UTC,"Concerning the last point about rape victims not telling their own stories, and not intending to imply that this is enough representation of victims' viewpoints:  There is Dany, who is a major POV character. Also we get a POV from Aeron Greyjoy with heavyhanded implications that he was sexually molested as a child from his brother.  I think the way rape is handled in the show vs. the books is also worth noting. The books are careful not to gloss over any of the horrors of war, and the discerning reader will be made uncomfortable that otherwise noble characters condone or participate in sexual assault. I think this is preferable to the way rape is handled in the way we look at our own history of war, where it is usually minimized or omitted completely when discussing causes and figures that are favorably remembered. Also important to recognize that in-world definitions of rape are different than modern definitions, so the way it is handled in-world is often intended to be abhorrent to us.  The books also portray different reactions to rape in-world. You have Khal Drogo and the Dothraki, you have Dany's uncomfortable reaction and the way witnessing it and the horrible result of her attempted intervention haunts her for the rest of her arc, you have Tywin encouraging Gregor Clegane to do his worst to traumatize the Riverlands, you have Stannis gelding any man who raped a wildling after the battle north of the Wall.  I think the show shoots to show rape as part of the horror of war and, indeed, the horror of what humans are capable of, as well, but lacks the nuance to consistently achieve it (or even understand what constitutes rape, in-world or out). There is a fine line between the above and using rape as scenery. Contrast the spectacle at Craster's Keep (casual background rape) with Arya overhearing Chiswyck gleefully describing a rape committed by himself and his men in what is one of the most horrific scenes in the book. The latter is, imo, much better done.  Just my two cents."
FemmeThoughts,37lfb7,PM_ME_STUPID_JOKES,22,Thu May 28 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"Your points about the way the books handle rape are spot on. I have never been bothered by the way it has been depicted or discussed in the books.   The show, however... Honestly I think the show does more than use rape as scenery. They fetishize it. I find it off-putting in the extreme."
FemmeThoughts,37lfb7,airial,19,Thu May 28 22:02:08 2015 UTC,"I remember the Craster episode where they were literally focusing in on the bouncing breasts of a woman as she was being raped.

FemmeThoughts,37lfb7,lavenderblue,6,Fri May 29 02:31:37 2015 UTC,"I know it's just speculation but it really, really makes me question the motives (and morals) of those making the decisions on the show.  Rape (and general ""sexposition,"" it should be noted) has been shoehorned into scenes in the show where it doesn't add much of anything to the story. So why is it there? Why have female characters, main female characters, been raped when they were not in the books?    For better or worse I now have this uncomfortable impression that Benioff and Weiss are rapey perverts."
FemmeThoughts,37lfb7,airial,2,Fri May 29 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, and I find it interesting that in the show, Sansa's rape focused on Theon and Theon's reaction rather than Sansa. It took the horror away from Sansa as a victim, and instead made it seem as though Theon was the true victim in all of this."
FemmeThoughts,37lfb7,Quouar,17,Fri Jun 5 16:55:09 2015 UTC,Another thing people seems to misunderstand is off-screen vs on-screen rape.

Her gender has hindered every aspiration that she ever had.   Her original plan was just to run around the country side being a knight with Jaime, but her dickhead father couldn't have that.. he's the one who turned her into the monster that she is because she has to have every ounce of power just to not be taken advantage of."
FemmeThoughts,37lfb7,hhhnnnnnggggggg,3,Fri May 29 01:46:37 2015 UTC,"And Mr. Freeze was only ever looking to cure his wife. All good villains have backstories like Cersei's. All they ever wanted was blank, but the world was cruel to them, and because blank they were turned into a monster. Cersei has murdered countless innocents for her own idiotic vengeance. She kills her own family. She urged the death of her husband the king, she almost killed her own son, she risks the life of Myrcella, and is trying to kill her own damn brother because he tried to prevent her from keeping Myrcella out of danger. This directly following one failed attempt at Tyrion's life.  And that's merely within her own family. Cersei's narcissism has caused the death and suffering of countless deaths of innocents both on and offscreen. The fact that you're arguing this at all is not grounds for her not being a villain, but rather for her being an exceptionally well-written one."
FemmeThoughts,37lfb7,skyskr4per,1 point,Fri May 29 04:54:24 2015 UTC,"She's an antagonist, but not a villain (the same with that version of Mr. Freeze). I don't find her actions to be out of cruelty (that's Joffrey's cup of tea), but instead out of necessity which would differentiate her from a villain. But her actions are selfish. Very, very selfish and stupid.   But if I was in her spot, I couldn't say I'd give a damn about the world either.   Joffrey = Villain  Cersei = Antagonist  And to be fair.. most of her family deserved to die (excluding her two youngest...and maybe Tyrion, but he isn't innocent). Her father practically started the domino effect and while her husband didn't do anything directly it seemed like an issue of marital rape with the way she described how disgusting he was. She aborted any child that may have belonged to him."

FemmeThoughts,37dum7,your_ex_girlfriend-,28,Wed May 27 00:03:35 2015 UTC,"Oh god. I'm sick of people saying East Asians wanna look like white people because they favor light skin and double eyelid folds. The light skin thing has been around since forever because it means you're wealthy and don't have to work in the fields. Light skin occurs naturally to East Asians if they stay out of the sun. Double eyelid folds also occur naturally in East Asians, and most of those who get the surgery are trying to look like other East Asians with double eyelid folds.   Look at East Asian runway/super models. It's like they choose the most clearly East Asian looking ones. The fashion industry doesn't try to white out East Asian features, at least.   /rant  But yes over all I do agree that non white women are underrepresented in just about everything in the Western world. It's been nice seeing non white people in bigger roles lately, but it seems like their roles have to do with their race or ethnicity.. (E.g. being a slave or the ""exotic"" romantic interest for the main white male protagonist, who often are left behind by him by the end of the movie) Like that's the only reason to put non white women in visible roles. I like it when characters just happen to be non white and they don't make a big deal out of it. It's pretty neat. Examples of those that I can think of off the top of my head are:  Michonne from the Walking Dead  London from the Suite Life of Zack and Cody (I'm not entirely sure because I didn't watch this show much but I remember my sister watching it and IIRC she was supposed to be like Paris Hilton)  ...Help me out here lol I haven't seen Grey's Anatomy but I'm sure there are a few from that show."
FemmeThoughts,37dum7,umenohana,20,Tue May 26 23:27:38 2015 UTC,I like it when characters just happen to be non white and they don't make a big deal out of it.    Zoe from Firefly.  I don't remember her race or gender ever being a topic in the show.

FemmeThoughts,37dum7,so_srs,10,Wed May 27 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"To add to your list, The 100 is a good show for representation. Say what you will about the plotholes and flawed logic that run rampant within the show's lore, they've got some solid representation, and race just doesn't come up (it's 97 years post-apocalypse, and the few survivors seem to have gotten past racial and ethnic issues, although the show is set in 2149 so that's room for some change, likely accelerated due to necessity).  They've got a black woman (Indra) in her 40s leading a village and its warriors, acting as a high-ranking general. They've got a disabled latina zero-G mechanic (Raven) who is a damned genius, and who owns her sexuality and won't be shamed by it. They've got a woman of tibetan descent (Anya) who is a fearless, ruthless badass warrior/general.  None of the above are defined by being love interests. None of them are sexualized outside of minor typical facial makeup on Raven (Indra and Anya, respectively, aren't sexualized at all on the show, IMO). On a side note, it's also a big plus for non white men, as well as in non-hetero sexualities, having the main character be a bisexual woman, and the most powerful character on the show being a lesbian. The show's not perfect, but its representation is damn good.  I'll second Zoe from Firefly, who didn't ever have to answer for her skin colour. Sharon from Battlestar Galactica was similar in that sense, though there was another element at play that set her apart, even if it wasn't race or sexuality."

The light skin thing has been around since forever because it means you're wealthy and don't have to work in the fields. Light skin occurs naturally to East Asians if they stay out of the sun.   Ugh, I know, right? Dear racists, light skin has been a valued feature in Asian cultures since long before any kind of contact with European cultures. It has nothing to do with the ""superiority"" of European light skin, because Asian light skin was valued before Europeans ever started colonizing, or indeed, crawled its way out of the Dark Ages (another Eurocentric term). This millennia old value does not revolve around you.   Double eyelid folds also occur naturally in East Asians, and most of those who get the surgery are trying to look like other East Asians with double eyelid folds.   Agreed. The ""double eyelid"" is prevalent in what, every human ""race""? Including around 50% of Asians? So why assume wanting a ""double eyelid"" like the other half of the Asian population has anything to do with white people, like, at all? Maybe we want to look like black people. Did you think that was absurd? Well, now you know how we feel (also, that's super racist, you racist).  It's telling how Eurocentric the world is when people automatically assume light=white, and that every beauty standard revolves around trying to look more white.    Now that said, I do not support the Asian beauty standard that light skin or double eyelids are better. Asians skin tones are possibly the most diverse in humanity and can range from as dark as it gets, to as light as it gets. Putting one range of shades over the rest is terrible, because even beyond the individual repercussions, it has the effect of marginalizing South Asians (generalizing here). It also obviously has the super uncomfortable classist distinction which Asia has a huge problem with.  Also as I said before, there is about a half and half split among Asians for the ""double eyelid"" and so this beauty standard negatively effects at least half of the Asian population.  It's weird having to sometimes defend beauty standards I don't even agree with so we can get race out of the equation before breaking it down."
FemmeThoughts,37dum7,dino_friends,5,Wed May 27 06:31:24 2015 UTC,"I think I read double eyelid folds are only naturally occurring in about a quarter of Koreans but about 50% and up among other East Asians. If you look at SE Asians, the majority seem to have double eyelid folds than not.   It's funny cuz some white women get surgery to lift their eyelids if they have hooded eyes (like Renee Zellweger) but no one ever accuses them of trying to look South Asian or what have you. No one says they're trying to look East Asian when white people get nose jobs to make their noses smaller. Naw. Everybody just wants to look European.   I totally agree about the whole skin tone thing being a problem in Asia. I saw a lot of products in Malaysia with promises to make brown skin lighter, and it just seemed so..ugh. It's such a sunny, hot place and people are expected to be pale to be pretty? It would be so much better if they had more skin colors (and eyelid types where that's a problem) represented in the media over in Asia. It's like women with monolids don't exist according to the media in E Asia. No wonder why so many people wanna get the surgery done. :-/"
FemmeThoughts,37dum7,umenohana,2,Wed May 27 07:06:22 2015 UTC,"From what I've gathered from my own writing, from reading various writers, playing video games, watching movies and consuming other such media, is that there are two ways to build your character in relation to the above.  Either they're well-rounded enough and three dimensional enough that their gender, ethnicity, sexual preference or gender identification doesn't matter, and so you can see how good a character is if you can switch their gender or ethnicity, etc, and not impact the story in any way.  The other side of the coin is that their ethnicity, sexual preference, gender identity or sex is important to them as a character. That it's something that is intrinsic to their identity and they are who they are because they are gay, or Hispanic, or a woman.  It's also my understanding that most movies, etc, reinforce and perpetuate the white, cis-gender, able-bodied, heteronormative male-centric status quo. The ""man of action"", is indeed a man, and is almost always white, cis-gender and heterosexual. And whenever a narrative revolves around more than one character, often the peripheral characters are made different through the introduction of alternate sex, ethnicity, etc.  And so those characters, that are altogether flat and uninteresting, are made ""interesting"" by simple virtue of being non-white, non-male, and so on. It's bullshit. And I think characters would be better served by, for instance, giving a full, three-dimensional character to an African-American actress, for example, to show that women of colour are indeed people with complex personalities, rather than having them fulfill the role of ""the black friend"", or ""token black person""."

Prime example of this kind of thing: dress codes for women who work as waitresses in restaurants. There is a LOT I could rant about in these sexist dress codes (skirt length must be at or shorter than your finger tips in some places, for example, or you must wear your hair down even if it gets in people's food all the time) - but the relevant piece in of a lot of them is ""must wear 1 inch heel."" I have many friends who work in the restaurant industry and women are required to wear at least a once inch heel, sometimes wedges or boots aren't even allowed. And then they're expected to teeter around on them for over 8 hours without scheduled breaks and without overtime pay. Add onto that, that they are required to tip out up to 5% of their sales regardless of whether they received 5% or greater in tips on their sales so, if they don't make more than 5% in tips that night they are literally paying out of pocket to other staff. Sorry, getting off track again because the restaurant industry treats its workers so poorly and evades a lot of labour laws somehow. But yeah, being required to work in heels while men get to work in flat shoes is so sexist and shitty. Being required to wear heels to get into a bar is so sexist and shitty. You can have formal attire without a high heel. It's not like it's either sneakers or heels and no in between!"
FemmeThoughts,379itg,Throwaway5232015,47,Mon May 25 23:44:13 2015 UTC,"It's called ""reproductive coercion,"" and it's unfortunately pretty common in some form or another (i.e. hiding bc pills, puncturing condoms) in abusive relationships. I'm not aware of any US jurisdiction that specifically defines this type of coercion as a sexual assault, but it's commonly considered to be a type of sexual violence by DV prevention advocates.  I'm very sorry that you had to go through that and that you have had so many lasting effects from your trauma. I certainly think you should try to get help from whatever source you feel might help you, including resources for survivors of sexual violence."
FemmeThoughts,379itg,The-Mighty-Monarch,12,Tue May 26 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is very helpful. I did not know what the word for it was so nothing was coming up on the Google machine. I'm really relieved to hear it is something people recognize and that someone has studied its prevalence. I was a little worried I would explain it to a therapist and they would think I was exaggerating or making things up."
FemmeThoughts,379itg,looseleafliesoflow,13,Tue May 26 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"Are the birth control sabotage and the sexual dysfunction connected?  Was your ex partner sexually abusive or is your disorder possibly from something else?  To answer your question in the title, I don't know if that counts as violence, but it is definitely wrong and it definitely counts as abuse."
FemmeThoughts,379itg,looseleafliesoflow,7,Tue May 26 02:27:05 2015 UTC,"My ex was not sexually abusive other than the sabotage thing. We don't know why I have this disorder. It just kind of started for no reason, I had a bunch of tests done, and I'm in the process of seeing if some kind of therapist would be better than medical treatment, either a sex therapist or maybe if I have issues around that part of my body that are related to sexual violence I need to see some other kind of therapist."
FemmeThoughts,379itg,kochipoik,6,Tue May 26 04:09:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I agree with another poster here that it is reproductive coercion; I'm glad they stepped in to share that term with us.  I'm also glad that it seems you have access to medical help and therapy.  It sounds like what you went through may have been traumatic, and I wish you the best in your journey to recovery.  You mentioned elsewhere that you were worried a therapist might dismiss your claims of abuse.  A good therapist will take you at your word, so I hope that thought doesn't deter you from seeking help.  It really looks like you are going through the steps you need to in order to get through this.  That takes a lot of strength, especially when you are dealing with depression.  Sorry I don't have too much advice related directly to your title question; I hope that you are able to find out the cause of your mystery condition so that you can alleviate it.    Your feelings are real and they matter."
FemmeThoughts,379itg,kochipoik,4,Tue May 26 06:17:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think what he did would be classed as ""sexual violence"", nor that the sabotaging of contraception would cause the pain. BUT even being in an abusive relationship (particularly one that involves sex) would probably be enough to cause/contribute.  Am I right in guessing you have a form of vulvodynia/vaginismus?  It may just be me, but I'm not sure that resources specifically for sexual violence would help with the pain. BUT it is definitely treatable - I would recommend seeing a physiotherapist who specialises in pelvic pains, and consider seeing a psychologist (who you may already be seeing for depression)."
FemmeThoughts,379itg,HurhurhurItsaWoman,9,Tue May 26 05:48:06 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons I didn't mention it as vulvodynia is because every time I bring it up, I end up having to explain a very lengthy treatment history and what I have/haven't tried. It just gets frustrating and I appreciate that people are trying to help, but it's just not productive for me to discuss. I can guarantee I've heard of just about every treatment out there. I've been seeking medical treatment for more than a year now, even traveled out of state to a vulvar pain clinic, and was evaluated as a candidate for pelvic floor therapy. At one point I was even on an anti-convulsant that gave me weird parathesias and made me feel like I had developed fibromyalgia. (Never again). It's been very exhausting and expensive to deal with."

FemmeThoughts,379itg,thatsnotgneiss,9,Tue May 26 18:59:39 2015 UTC,"I've read that trauma results from a feeling of total loss of control. Controlling your reproductive system is one way to take control away from you... To take control away from you of even your own body! That's what rape does. I don't know, to me it seems even worse. It's just a whole new level of twisted! That's absolutely disgusting, and an awful way of betraying someone's trust. It's the kind of thing that's so inhuman, it is hard to understand."
FemmeThoughts,379itg,The_Bombardier,19,Tue May 26 06:09:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not a professional or a survivor of any type of sexual violence, or really anything but a woman on the internet, but there are no other comments so maybe I'll just step in for the mean time? My gut says yes. You consented to protected sex. He deceived you through a sexual act. It's a violation of trust on a deep level. But I think because it is directly tied in with sex (which is a seriously emotional act and very often abused to manipulate and harm people) this takes it a step above just deception. He knowingly used your body in a way that you did not consent with. I think that this could be considered sexual violence.  And, honestly, regardless of what anyone says here, I would still reach out and look for resources. You never know, and they're there to help. If it's not the right place, ask them for more resources. It's good to start making connections because they'll help you eventually find something that does help.  Good luck <3"
FemmeThoughts,379itg,jrl2014,5,Tue May 26 01:16:47 2015 UTC,"If you feel like you need help, get help. Different things affect people differently.   That being said, Law and Order:SVU did an episode on Reproductive Coercion. It was nice to see it brought to  the mainstream."
FemmeThoughts,379itg,heart-cooks-brain,7,Tue May 26 03:15:23 2015 UTC,"A lot of folks have come in with great comments, but I just wanted to add my voice and say:  That is, most definately, sexual assault (reproductive coercion and non-consensual sex) and therefore I view it as 'sexual violence'.    You can call it what feels right or best for you, but I would (as a fellow survivor) see no issue with you classifying it as sexual assault or rape.    You also should definitely be encouraged to access resources for survivors of sexual abuse or violence, and should be accepted and supported in those communities.   If you get anybody telling you it doesn't classify, well... survivors are all at different stages of recovery and processing. Not everyone may see it this way, but I've got a lot of time and therapy and education on these issues under my belt and I'd defend your right to identify what happened as sexual violence to anyone.  so many hugs if okay to offer"
FemmeThoughts,379itg,The_Bombardier,6,Tue May 26 08:51:35 2015 UTC,"There was even a case in Canada in that ruled it was sexual assault for do so: http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/12/17/reproductive_coercion_poking_holes_in_condoms_should_be_a_crime.html  Maybe ""sexual violence"" or ""sexual assault"" isn't the ideal term, but its such an enormous betrayal of trust that it makes sense that people might react to it in the same way as they react to sexual assault.   I've had a friend who told her hook-up only sex with a condom-and he'd take the condom off halfway through. To me, that's a better example of reproductive coercion being assaultive."

Even so, there are 2-3 days a month where my headaches (cramps aren't too bad but holy shit hormone headaches are the worst) render me like 80% unfunctional. And I also have kidney problems that contraindicate for NSAIDs so I can only take acetaminophen, which doesn't help at all past certain point."

There were a few bits I quibbled on- like, I don't think I would say that most women take BC from their first period to their last) and there's also the whole woman=vagina thing going on through the whole article, but it's a good thing to think about on the whole."
FemmeThoughts,377h8d,ponyproblematic,46,Mon May 25 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"That bothered me, too. I'm also a little annoyed that the article included chocolate alongside must-haves like tampons and underwear-- imho that just trivializes the non-negotiable expenses that are such a burden on poorer women."
FemmeThoughts,377h8d,invisiblecows,32,Mon May 25 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"Yep. As someone who is mildly-to-completely broke most of the time, underwear is generally ""welp shit there's a stain. Next period this is what I'm wearing"" instead of just throwing it out."

In fact, come to think of it, as someone who has often had to go into fast food/gas station bathrooms to wrap the crotch of my underwear in single-ply toilet paper because I couldn't afford pads or tampons and know that a shoplifting charge/conviction would make me slip permanently between the cracks, maybe that's why the cultural chocolate craving trope makes me seethe. I mean, throw out stained underwear? Poor women don't necessarily get to throw out the stained pants. (♫♫♫ ""Well, you wonder why I always dress in black..."" ♫♫♫)  Doesn't take away from the ""pink tax"" point on a societal level, but yeah, the trivializing irks me too.

Ever since  I was a kid I've seen fit middle aged women with their less trim husbands in shopping malls, at Disneyland, in commercials, in movies, pretty much everywhere.  There has always been less social emphasis on the way the man looks, with women falling on a scale in terms of how much importance they personally place on appearance of their partner/spouse.    The real thing is that it seems like this will never be something we see happen for women, like Schaal says. I hope it one day does, but with the way every aspect of the media holds emphasizes the importance of a woman maintaining her youthful beauty (and the very strict definition of beauty that it pushes) it seems quite a ways off.  Furthermore, John basically said, ""well I kinda hoped this might transfer to women, thinness wasn't always stressed the way it is today"" but the dad bod just moves the standard from one place to another, rather than making all accepted.  If we returned to whatever time john was talking about, it would suck for the women who are naturally more on the thin side.  It always used to bug a college friend of mine when women with more curves than her would say ""real women have curves.""  Real men are the people who say they are men, same for women or whatever gender you label yourself as, regardless of body type."

FemmeThoughts,36zg75,enigma5908,47,Sat May 23 12:59:04 2015 UTC,Men aren't enrolling in as high of a numbers: We must figure out what's going on with men...   Women don't enroll in high numbers in STEM... Women just don't care about STEM. They aren't qualified. They care more about baby making.   Yeah let's face it. Men have way more options than women without college degree in terms of employment. Women without a college degree are mostly limited to the pink collared jobs: the customer service type jobs that usually don't have good pay.
FemmeThoughts,36zg75,HurhurhurItsaWoman,16,Sat May 23 17:59:37 2015 UTC,Took the words right out of my mouth. Women need to go to college to get a higher paying job because entry level pink collar jobs have shit pay.
FemmeThoughts,36zg75,trainofthought700,4,Sat May 23 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"On your last paragraph, can you explain what opportunities are different for men vs women without a college degree? Genuinely curious."
FemmeThoughts,36zg75,Troy_And_Abed_In_The,20,Sat May 23 19:45:10 2015 UTC,"Metallurgy, car mechanics, truck driving, construction worker, carpenters,..., jobs that require a lot of physical strength.  These fields are male dominated. Women still face a lot of resistance when breaking into them."
FemmeThoughts,36zg75,HurhurhurItsaWoman,4,Sat May 23 21:24:54 2015 UTC,"The numbers in this piece are also skewed. Not the college ones, the unemployment ones.   Men are better represented in unemployment figures not because fewer men have work, or because more men lost work, but because men are more likely to do the kind of work that when they lose it, lets them qualify for unemployment. If you look at the full statistics around the recent recession, women were hit way harder then men. They lost more work, they lost more work for longer, and they've had a much harder time getting work back. And the women who have gotten work back are much more likely to not be counted as employees.   These sorts of issues are ironically, exactly why more women enroll in college in higher numbers. Not only are women shut out of a lot of blue collar fields, but there is also far less regulation and protection in most pink collar fields. For many women, college isn't just a way to a better job, but a way to being counted by government. It's a way into fields where there are worker protections, where they are counted as employed, where they pay payroll taxes and can get benefits and be counted as unemployed if they lose work."

FemmeThoughts,36zg75,HurhurhurItsaWoman,14,Mon May 25 23:48:07 2015 UTC,Other interesting reading on this topic- http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/04/girls-grades.aspx  http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/09/education/09college.html?pagewanted=all  It rings so true in my experience. Most of the people I knew who were boozing it up or slacking off in undergrad were men and not surprisingly they were the ones most often taking longer to graduate. What is funny is that when I substitute teach I don't really see as much disparity between the boys or the girls in terms of off-task behavior which leads me to believe that both genders take this stuff seriously (in class) in equal amounts.
FemmeThoughts,36zg75,jrl2014,20,Sat May 23 13:03:32 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, girls' drinking in college is catching up to boys'--but women are still graduating in higher numbers.  Personally, I think its somewhat rational. White men with just a high school diploma still make more than black women with a college degree on average."
FemmeThoughts,36zg75,antigones,16,Sat May 23 17:42:48 2015 UTC,"""We've had every opportunity and still failed"" - what I hear when people complain about and feel threatened by the increased success of women in higher ed.  My anecdotal comment: I'm a student on a majority female campus studying science and education. And while it is probably better than at some schools, every science class I have taken is majorly skewed male (as in: 7 out of 23 were female identifying. 2/23 were WOC.)"
FemmeThoughts,36zg75,kissedbyfire9,10,Sat May 23 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"Yup, it also makes me wonder how many men don't feel they need higher education (because of how many other men they see doing well without it, the connections they know they have, etc.) So more men know they don't have to try."
FemmeThoughts,36yycp,bleuwillow,18,Sat May 23 08:27:19 2015 UTC,I would suggest The Left Hand Of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin and Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg. Great books that offer a lot of insights about gender and sexuality with a feminist perspective.
FemmeThoughts,36yycp,Cakyresp,2,Sat May 23 09:53:23 2015 UTC,Thank you! I've (regrettably) only read one thing by Le Guin (The Lathe of Heaven) and it was absolutely wonderful. Looking to read more of her for sure!
FemmeThoughts,36yycp,candydaze,5,Sat May 23 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"She's a little obscure, but zomg I love Traci Harding's books. She has so many awesome female characters from different times and places, and they're all so strong in their own way. Main character from one series is a martial arts expert, in another series the main female characters are psychic scholars. In a third series, there's a woman who can turn into a tigress at will, and has the raunchiest sex she can find with other tigers. There is some romance, but that's not the entire plot. And it does get a bit weird sometimes, but a good kind of weird.   Also, Isabelle Allende's feminism is wonderful. I really recommend House of the Spirits - her female characters are so incredibly detailed and strong, without necessarily being leather-clad, sword wielding warrior types.   Less in the feminism genre, but an interesting read from a gender perspective: Wheel of Time series. One commentator has put it that ""in this world, men are treated like women are in our world"". I haven't finished the series yet, and I'm not totally convinced (many stereotypes still perpetuated), but it's interesting It's not very explicit, but the gender dynamics are definitely different to how things are now. Though the entire premise of the magic system is very gender based, and really doesn't allow room for transgendered people."
FemmeThoughts,36yycp,reliably,6,Sat May 23 12:25:24 2015 UTC,"I would be careful of wheel of time. I quit the series because of it's gender issues. In my opinion, all the women are 2d versions of the same woman. In Robert Jordan's mind, all women are short-tempered, unreasonable, shallow, irresponsible girls who, when given power, inevitably ruin things or trample over the poor hapless menfolk. Rumour is the author was trying to write something feminist, but I think he failed....  Which is to say, I know a lot of feminists who like the series so you might like it, but maybe read 1 book before you commit to the rest. It is also the longest work of English fiction ever written, so there's that."

FemmeThoughts,36yycp,lockedge,2,Sat May 23 10:08:31 2015 UTC,It's The Handmaid's Tale. Why on earth has everyone collectively misremembered this title? I don't get it!
FemmeThoughts,36yycp,hermithome,2,Sun May 24 00:19:20 2015 UTC,"People do this all the time with words.   ""province"" becomes ""providence"". ""wary"" becomes ""weary"". ""amused"" becomes ""bemused"". And ""handmaid"" becomes ""handmaiden"".  People just do this often because the English language is strange, and it's common for people to get fed up and assume certain words mean certain things by how they sound, and for them to replace one word with another more familiar to them if it sounds better/more common to them. It's a bit depressing, and can make discussions confusing sometimes, but usually their intent is unearthed eventually."
FemmeThoughts,36yycp,Adahn5,3,Mon May 25 03:29:50 2015 UTC,"Sure, I know, but it's weird to change the title of a book. And it's so common.

FemmeThoughts,36yycp,-withallduerespect-,1 point,Mon May 25 08:10:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe people tend to change the name because of the term handmaiden being more popular in fantasy and medieval fiction.

Hopefully this will be the final straw that shuts down Gothardism's acceptance into the mainstream.  The ""character education"" programs are still used in Arkansas prisons."

I sought her out as soon as I heard about this last night, and I'm quite glad to see she's discussing it. The only thing she didn't cover that I hoped for was the fact that the Duggars have been running transphobic [ETA: and homophobic] campaigns against *queer rights (bathroom bills! *'traditional' marriage!) for years in order to 'protect children'. The hypocrisy of knowing that a proven predator is in your own family while smearing an entire demographic is just too much for me."

In their view, what brings people closer to God is good for them, and thus good for children as those children can then be raised in a ""Godly"" way. This is ""good"" and it's how children are ""protected."" That which brings children and people further away from their very specific image of God and what God wants is ultimately more harmful. As they see it, God specifically disallows things like gay marriage, so those must be stopped. In the case of this guy, though, he apparently repented, and so isn't a danger because he's ""grown closer to God."""

FemmeThoughts,36b2hu,SolidBlues,11,Sun May 17 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"You have to love Feminism for it's ability to recognise oppressive systems: racism, capitalism, homophobia, transphobia, and how it has developed/adopted anlyses, critiques and theories to explain and fight back against them. Queer theory, eco-Feminism, Marxist-Feminism or Anarcha-Feminism. Intersectionality is paramount to Feminism for it to present a complete understanding of Patriarchy and how it oppresses women (and men).  Articles like this one really present a window into how countries that went through proletarian revolutions embraced Feminism in a way that the West did not. Especially in China, where they recognised early that the concept of Man and Woman were not natural, as was touted in the west, but artificial, social constructs1  It's too bad that we aren't taught enough about women's movements in these places. Much less of the paragons of the day, like He-Yin Zhen, the Anarcha-Feminist who wrote ""On The Question Of Women's Liberation"" and ""On The Question Of Women's Labor"" while in her exile in Japan, and who no doubt inspired many of the revolutionary feminists during Mao's time.  This blog post, though liberal in tone, recognises the necessity for Feminism to be tied to such anti-Capitalist movements and revolutions:   there’s a difference between arguing for equality in capitalism, and trying to change our economic system as we know it. Feminism isn’t only about equality; it’s about believing that you can alter the status quo, and feminism has deep historical connections with socialism/Marxism/anarchism.   In the end, I love what the Anarcha-Feminists of Spain say in their banners now a days: ""La revolución será feminista o no será!"" = The Revolution will be a Feminist one, or there won't be one!  We've seen what happens when we leave revolutions in the hands of rich, cisgender, able-bodied, straight, white, men. We end up with a country that doesn't represent the vast majority of the population, and concentrates wealth, power and authority in the hands of an oppressive, white supremacist, patriarchal, capitalist elite.  1 Brownell, Susan Elaine., Jeffrey N.

FemmeThoughts,36b2hu,Adahn5,7,Sun May 17 23:58:45 2015 UTC,"People seem to act surprised when I tell them that feminism has been in China for a really long time. In fact, the status of women has been linked to growing nationalism and the state of the country since the late 1800s, when people were arguing whether one needs to reform or to overthrow the Qing government. Women activists have been around since at least the May Fourth Movement in 1919; the movement was part of the New Culture Movement, which emphasized anti traditionalism and an embrace of western culture as one of their main ideas.   I should note that even with this push for equality in the GPCR (Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution), gender roles still played a big deal. ""Femininity"", or at least being femme (e.g. makeup, the latest fashions, long hair) were seen as bourgeois. Women could and have been assaulted in the street in urban areas to have their long hair chopped off. Women were expected to become accepted in society by taking on the hyper-masculinity represented by the Iron Girl. The act of expressing femininity was linked to class oppression and was repressed, while masculinity was pushed for as an ideal. In other words, women had to act like and dress like men in order to succeed. The article does mention that women rarely wore skirts; this was because wearing skirts was seen as decadent and bourgeois. Gender expression was still highly policed towards the masculine, but now it was framed as a class struggle. Such an idea was later rejected in the 1980s, but with that came what we would call ""biotruths"" regarding men and women. Gender roles was still policed, but now the dynamic was based on ""biology"", rather than ""class struggle"".  I can give you a citation when I get out of bed.

FemmeThoughts,366ygk,Adahn5,11,Sat May 16 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"I've studied quite a bit of cultural anthro, so here's my take (for whatever a BA in anthro is worth.)  so, the big deal is that foraging societies (aka hunter/gatherer) tend to live in small bands most of the year, only getting together in big communities once and a while for things like summer festivals.  Because bands are so small, problems can be solved creatively and there is no need for a rigid rule structure (""there's like 60 of us here... we can figure out something that makes us all happy."") What this ends up meaning is that the society might have taboos and cultural practices, but can be very flexible.  EXAMPLE: the !Kung have a rule that only men can touch arrows. 50 year old woman's husband sucks at hunting and decides that she's going to be a hunter herself because she wants more meat.  Everyone decides that the reason why only men touch arrows is because only hunters touch arrows, she's a hunter now: ok she can touch arrows and come hunting with the guys.  Same people, the !Kung, have a tradition of trial marriages, meaning that they arrange marriages for their sons and daughters, but if it dissolves, no harm no foul. There are no big gifts exchanged so there's no loss.  I could go on and on about what makes horticultural societies more likely to be dominated by women, and herding cultures more dominated by men (who owns what, and where families are located) but a bit of that is addressed in the article, and I'm running long as it is."

FemmeThoughts,3650lg,coffeejeong,5,Sat May 16 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"I felt exactly as you do a few years back and it took a very intelligent tutor from my seminar telling me that times are changing to make me change my perception. People are living much longer, and because of how this economic system has failed us; the jobs that were once secure for us without higher education are being shipped overseas and the requisites for today's jobs being higher than before—with BAs being the new High School diploma, and MAs being the new BAs, we've pushed and delayed our mandatory entrance into the workforce. I won't go into how ""earning a living"" is a bunch of crap. I'll let Buckminster Fuller handle that:   We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.   From ""The New York Magazine Environmental Teach-In"" by Elizabeth Barlow in New York Magazine (30 March 1970), p. 30  The problem, too as you said, is that we have to contend with those old fashioned, societal impositions of marriage and reproduction. Fulfilling one's duty to the community, historically and anthropologically speaking, in its simplest form was just to reproduce. So now those societal impositions are having to fight against the realities of our economic system's impositions, and of course the ones that suffer are none else but us: the workers who don't have access to many millions of dollars in trust funds, to the free-flowing Capital of their companies, or the stock market gains their shares net them, etc. And are able to have the careers they want if they even want them, or start a family at whatever age they want, and who are free to care or not care for children because they have the means to exploit others to do it for them.  And working women are further saddled with the double shift—having to work a job and then coming home to perform reproductive labour. It's not fair. So please don't feel like it's a failure on your part in any way, or that you'll be unwanted by any prospective partner. Any person that doesn't understand these realities isn't worth your time. The men who filled most blue-collar jobs that are now severely limited in the Global North are the first to embrace MRA movements, and their rhetoric is pervasive and intermingles with a lot of traditionalist rhetoric about the things you're feeling.  The arguments like ""you've got an expiration date,"" ""your eggs limited in number!"", ""don't want to end up an old maid, do you?"" etc, are horrid and it's understandable that they would add to your stress. But you're a wonderful person /u/goldencanoe. Don't let those voices dictate to you what's expected of you. That way lies depression.  ""The One"" will appear in due time, and more likely when you're not actively searching for them. As I said, our life expectancy has changed for the most part, and 30 is the new 20. Focus on you, /u/goldencanoe, on getting happy and content without worrying about what's wanted and expected of you. If you can do that, you'll be better able to find a person that will complement your life. Someone you can share your life with, rather than fill it as if you had a void, or complete it as if you were less than a whole person.  You're awesome and amazing all on your own. You're all you need, even if it's not all you may want. :3  TL;DR: Life expectancy has altered so don't listen to society's crap and focus on making yourself happy. You're young and awesome and valuable and ::Hugs::"

With Tubman on the bill, more people might at least be talking seriously about racial and gender equality in our own time. I wouldn't ignore the psychological impact that these small tokens could create.   And at the very least, it doesn't make sense to continue glorifying Jackson, even if it is a more accurate representation of our racist, sexist, classist, etc, culture - because that's not how mainstream society interprets Jackson's face on their money.

However you look at it, Ms Savali's article has lead to a fantastic discussion...   Just wanted to share the first comment from the article. Tubman being on the $20 bill would be a great conversation starter, instead of shutting people up.  Having a black woman on a commonly used bill will definitely shake things up where I live.

Yeah, it's pretty much a myth that Yoko Ono broke up The Beatles... took an entire class on it. There were so many other reasons that were leading up to their break up. Nobody knows what happened on their trip to India that seemed to have upset the balance. Also, another reason they broke up is that The Beatles simply grew up. They started together since they were teens, and now they were men in their mid and late twenties. I remember there was a quote from Paul, which basically said that he was rather hang out with his wife than the boys all the time.   Edit: And yes, John Lennon and Yoko Ono were pretty much attached at the hip. When Yoko Ono got in a car crash and was confined to bed, John Lennon put a bed in the recording studio, so that Yoko Ono could still be there... You can see footage where The Beatles are practicing and off to the side there is a bed with Yoko Ono....

I tell them it's not about the artist's name or the skill required, not even about the art itself. All that matters is 'How does it make you feel?'""  I agree with it. I respect that.   I think people have a tendency to condemn the entirety of a thing (whether it's a movie, political view, person, hobby, etc.) for partial criticism, where harshly criticizing one or more specific parts of the thing leads to determining the whole is the same. I don't mean whether or not they ""like"" it, but that they can see no good in it whatsoever, going as far to dismiss - and even condemn - a part of it that, had it appeared in something they ""liked,"" they would have revered.   That makes me sad. Thinking in such black and white terms seems like such an exclusionary life that has the potential to cause inner strife and turmoil, if carried over into how one views oneself. Do they see their mistakes and areas in need of improvement as irredeemable? If not, how do they separate themselves so completely from the thing they are condemning?   ""It makes me feel alone."""
FemmeThoughts,35znzj,Craylee,5,Fri May 15 11:05:03 2015 UTC,"While I do think dislike of her is often rooted in sexism, there are legitimate reasons to not like her. She is very pretentious, her singing is painful to listen to (which I know has no bearing on her personality, but it still isn't great), she was too involved in Beatles recording sessions - if you watch Let it Be, you can see how uncomfortable the others are.  Oh and she also used Lennon's bloodstained glasses from when he was shot in an exhibition."
FemmeThoughts,35znzj,goodoldfreda,4,Fri May 15 10:18:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think being involved in the avant-garde is a reason to dislike somebody - everyone has their own interests. Plus, have you not heard ""Walking on Thin Ice""? That's at least one jam more people can get behind."
FemmeThoughts,35znzj,MeAndLazarus,2,Fri May 15 13:02:23 2015 UTC,That does have a nice groove to it. I was more referring to the sort of singing she did when Lennon performed with Chuck Berry on a tv show in the 70s. She entirely ruined the tone of the music.
FemmeThoughts,35znzj,goodoldfreda,4,Fri May 15 13:16:48 2015 UTC,"That popular YouTube clip (you're referring to this one with Bill Burr's commentary, right?) was referenced in the article here:   Lennon and Berry are “killing it,” Burr declares, and Ono’s just “playing some stupid fucking drum, and even though she has no fucking talent whatsoever, he’s putting her in the fucking band just so she’ll shut the fuck up and stop nagging him!” This joke was not original enough to offend me, but I felt an anger rising when Burr panned back: “Dude, did you ever have, like, a buddy of yours and he’s dating some fucking psycho but he’s in love with her so you can’t fucking say anything? And you’re just sitting there waiting for the fucking lightning bolt to hit your friend in the head where he finally realizes that he’s dating a psycho cunt?”  I have always been drawn to the women who can arouse this kind of vitriol. The kind of hate that seems too big and billowing to be directed at just one woman, the kind that seems like a person or an entire society is vomiting out all its misogyny onto one convenient scapegoat. At some point — after successive Joan of Arc and Courtney Love phases — I started to see this position of feminine abjectness as a kind of superpower. A position from which a woman could offend far more deeply than a man.   I followed the other discussions of this article and someone pointed out that particular night was taped at peak Ono-hate in the 70s. She was having panic attacks, she wasn't comfortable, and John Lennon brought her onstage anyway.  I felt much more sympathy for her after reading that."

I always feel like a huge prude or a bad feminist because porn upsets me and i can't watch it.  I think it upsets me because it comes from the perspective of women and sex designed for male consumption, and then in that way it feels objectifying instead of empowering.   It really upsets me when women are reduced to objects designed for consumption, particularly sexual objects.  I  think it has something to do with my rape.  I can't enjoy sex or my sexuality because it's hard for me to separate being sexual from being objectified.    Like I don't wear revealing clothes in the summer to embrace my sexuality because cat calls remind me of my rape for some reason.    tldr I was raped and now I see sexism everywhere, and now I cannot separate my own sexuality/being a sexual being, from being objectified and it's messing me up.  Also, my brother frequently has anti feminist rants and I don't know many other feminists or where to find them.  Ugh I'm just tired and it feels like a crappy world out there where I'm all alone."

I wasn't saying that women had an obligation to do this thing in particular, I think I was pretty clear that it was just ""if no great objection exists, it's one of many nice things people in relationships can do, and people in relationships should do at least some nice things for their partner because you know, they love them, and you should try to make your loved ones happy"". It is also commendable to pick up your partner's favorite candy if you pass some at the store, or to bring them soup after work if they're sick. No, no apparently that's wrong, and I'm crazy and possibly full of internalized misogyny for shaving or waxing ever, because it causes me mild discomfort. Kinda stopped ever posting here after that.  Obviously that's not nearly as huge a problem as DV survivors being excluded from discussions about DV, my thing is way, way pettier. I guess it just kind of illustrates a common problem with feminist spaces sometimes? Once you get out of that liberal feminist, 'literally anything goes, woo support all female decisions forever regardless of social pressures that might be worth critically examining', sort of space... shit tends to form a very defensive sort of exclusionary set of views with little room for debate. /feminisms is the worst at that, fucking TERFs who think BDSM is always abuse with no room for debate on the topic, uuugh. But it's honestly, yeah, kind of a common problem.  I think it's just that feminists are so used to being criticized by uneducated anti-feminists, that we just get really, really defensive about dissenting opinions... even if those opinions are actually... not shitty. If it looks vaguely like a more common and terrible opinion, it's gonna get lumped in there, even if it's totally not being made for the same uneducated reasons. There's just so many assholes, having asshole opinions, that many feminist spaces throw up walls at the very thought of having one nearby. Understandable, but there's some decent opinions and people that get hit in the crossfire. Would be neat if there were some way to handle that, but I actually don't know of one? But I think that's what's going on. Sometimes I think libfems err on the side of being way too vague about their opinions, and lack critical analysis of some stuff, but one thing I'll say for them, they are so much nicer to hang out with on average in my experience."
FemmeThoughts,35yk7x,hermithome,13,Thu May 14 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"RE: My situation -- My big issue was the deletion of the comments and then being banned without even being informed I was now banned. I tried to like a link the page posted later on and discovered I could no longer like or comment on anything. No one asked for further information from me. Or engaged in any dialogue. The comments on that page are really circlejerky type stuff. I think the page is kind of trash and presents a pretty negative stereotype of feminists and a very narrow view of rape culture.  The way to handle a situation like this is to engage in a discussion with the people who have an opposing view and not dismiss and ad hominem attack them, imho. My comments were deleted and I was banned not for being or really even conveying a misogynist POV, but because I didn't have the exact same POV as the page. That's some really dangerous territory if you ask me.  RE: Your situation -- That really sucks! I think shaving and general body ""hygiene"" is up to the person. Some folks like to shave, some don't. I like to shave every now and again. Sometimes I just do one leg or pit and get bored. I'm strange! I definitely trim up a lot more often when I have a partner, but that's my decision. There's no obligation and there is a certain amount of ""ease of use"" that can be factored in by being able to see a little down there. I also go to shows of bands I hate or buy soy milk instead of almond for my partners. Or sometimes I visit their parents on Christmas even though I really really don't want to, but they would like me to and I love them. I totally see where you're coming from! As long as no one is being shamed or obligated to do some kind of hygienic act, but you know your partner has a preference then folks should feel free to make those kinds of personal mini sacrifices. But if there's some kind of expectation or pressure to do something you don't want to do that is also so utterly superficial then we should be apprehensive about the ways our partners interact and respect us."

Facebook groups also rarely are well organised, and rarely are broad in nature.  You called this group a ""feminist"" group, but while it may be made up of and run by feminists, it's actually a single topic group. That's another thing that happens on facebook a lot, but doesn't in the same way on reddit. There are a huge numbers of differences between the platforms. FB is not intended for discourse, reddit is.   It's also not uncommon for people to feel that forums and message boards are better for certain types of conversation. You can go out on multiple tangents, take time to look stuff up and carefully craft replies - things that don't happen in real life."

I also think the fb groups that I am actually active in (rather than link/recipe collecting from) tend to be much more discourse oriented. (eg. Vegan Persuasion group is about discussing how to be effective communicators for vegetarianism; Leftists in the US; Radical Fantasy/Sci Fi Book Club, etc.)"

It's not that you can't find discussion on FB, it's just not the biggest thing there, it's not what the platform is designed for.   Minimalist interactions on social media platforms tend to encourage performance, not interaction. Which is why FB tend to have a lot of groups like the one you mentioned. Single topic, no real discussion. The point of the group is that people like it, or occasionally share articles, and are able to demonstrate (perform) their interests and causes. It's just a totally different thing than a group of people coming together for discussion - whether that group is online or off."

Actually, if you're talking about the thread I remember, that's not accurate. You were criticised because you heavily tone policed someone who didn't want to shave – you called her aggressive, said that she treated her partner like garbage and declared that her article was bad for the cause, because she made women who don't shave seem like stereotypical angry, man-hating feminists.  No one had an issue with your stance that it's nice to do something you're not too fond of, because you know it makes your partner happy. Nor did anyone say that your personal grooming choices were the result of internalised misogyny or anything like that.  Had someone invalidated you in the manner you describe, we would have removed their comments and warned them, because that is against our rules. But no one did. You were borderline in terms of our rules on tone policing and false equivalences, but as there were lots of involved people in the thread and the discussion was going well, we decided against intervening.  If you do ever run into an issue with being invalidated or anything else, please do let us know. You can use the report button, or you can message the moderators."
FemmeThoughts,35yk7x,bombeater,3,Thu May 14 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"Well, no, I criticized some people who were describing reacting abusively towards requests that they should shave. I didn't say the person in the article was treating her partner like garbage, but rather that other people were endorsing that, which they were. Just straight up describing totally unacceptable behaviors within a relationship, like calling your partner names. Gonna stand by that being wrong. I also commented that because the goal of the article seemed to be normalizing non-shaving within the wider population, that tone actually matters, which... is not an automatically wrong opinion unworthy of consideration, but also yeah could see how maybe that was the wrong avenue for that opinion. But that's also not the bit I was referring to. After that, in other comments responding to other people, while describing my own life, I said the stuff about shaving because it is nice to do things for your partner, and perhaps because the previous damage had already been done, I got pretty harshly invalidated for a handful of comments until I just stopped responding, and that is what I was actually referring to. Nothing was removed, it may have been you or another mod who was participating (it was a mod, I don't recall who).   edit: but I get in a lot of debates on reddit, and you seem to remember this in more than me, so I also might be conflating more than one thread or something. I am reasonably sure this happened here and as I described, but you're the one with the photomemory thing going on, so if I've got some of these details wrong then shrug"
FemmeThoughts,35yk7x,bluebogle,21,Thu May 14 18:13:52 2015 UTC,"Sure. I was the mod you were talking with. I was also OP, so you'll note none of my comments were greenhatted in that discussion. This means I was speaking as OP/a member of the community, rather than as a mod.  For what it's worth, I still disagree with you in the context of that discussion, which was framed much differently than how you're presenting it here. Which is ok. It was almost a year ago. None of us can be expected to remember anything other than our impressions and probably a few stray details from a conversation about shaving politics from that long ago.    I want to point out two things, then I'm going to ask that you respect OP's rant and try to stay on topic to what OP has asked to discuss (if you would like to continue rehashing the other thread, please don't hesitate to send a PM or a modmail), which means that further diversions will be removed:    Just straight up describing totally unacceptable behaviors within a relationship, like calling your partner names.   There was no name calling or discussion/support of same. Period. Not in the thread, not in the article, not in the comments. I want to reiterate that if you were unhappy with how that discussion went, your place in it, and your downvotes, we all completely understand. We've all had that experience, and it sucks. But unfortunately, what you remember as happening isn't actually what went down there.    After that, in other comments responding to other people, while describing my own life, I said the stuff about shaving because it is nice to do things for your partner, and perhaps because the previous damage had already been done, I got pretty harshly invalidated for a handful of comments until I just stopped responding, and that is what I was actually referring to.   I went out of my way in that thread to validate you. I don't regret doing it, and I don't hold it over you, or anything, but people disagreeing with you and refusing to come over to your side of the argument isn't invalidation. Though it can definitely feel shitty. I just reviewed the entire post twice and there is good reason none of the other comments were removed. We don't pull things just for disagreement or for being blunt. There was some material that wasn't as gentle to your perspective as it could have been, but not being sweet isn't the same as invalidation. Basically, if you want to give someone else say over your body, cool. Telling other people that they should do the same, not cool. At least, not here.  (DOES ANYONE REMEMBER HOW TO FIX LIST NUMBERS? THIS IS SO IRRITATING)    ETA: Can we not downvote her, please? She has every right to feel upset about how she remembers that thread going down.

I don't remember clearly, but the answer was something like, it's still playing out an abusive patriarchal narrative of men abusing women, because... maybe... something about the submissive role being associated with women no matter what, so even when dude is in that role, it's still playing out that narrative? Or maybe it reversed, where when a woman is in a dominant role, she's just playing at being male and so it's still reflecting that narrative. Not really sure. It was not super coherent, at any rate. Also when I mentioned that some women find controlled consensual nonconsent to be helpful/healing after actual sexual assault, because it's like reclaiming their agency over the situation by doing it on their terms with a safeword and stuff, people were just like ""no, no, that doesn't sound like a real thing"".

Even if people disagreed with what I had to say, it's a pretty innocuous comment that I made after months of contributing positively to the subreddit and clearly not being a troll--it did not deserve a ban. I wasn't given a reason or any avenue to contest it.  OP, your situation seems so much worse. That's infuriating, and your opinion and experiences deserve to be heard.

The more powerful and societally priveleged group is forced to make a few concessions, and suddenly they're the victims.   We poor, downtrodden men have to read a a whole article only about women! Men weren't mentioned at all! What a travesty! Even worse, men are the bad guys in this story! That can't be true, we protect the poor, needy women. I don't know any man who's ever hit a woman, unless, you know, she really had it coming! I don't approve of that, but...I understand. It's totally reasonable that women should expect a smack or two just for saying something that makes me mad. I wouldn't do that, but I'm just saying ""I get it"". And why do they have to keep calling themselves ""feminist""?? Once again, men aren't in that term at all, which can only mean that these bitches wanna chop our dicks off. Like what, do they think they're better than us or something? Haha, right? That's why I'm an egalatarian. Men are included in that term. Most of the members are men too, and that just makes me more comfortable for some reason. And we actually talk about guy's issues. Just like everything else. Except femisim. Lol, women's issues, right??  That's how I imagine the thought process. I see it everywhere on this site, especially since I'm still on a few defaults just to see what people are saying. It's valuable to be a victim, it just sucks when you actually are the victim and then you get rape and death threats for it. And sometimes actually death. Pretty horrifying."
FemmeThoughts,35oyuu,rachawakka,56,Tue May 12 11:26:50 2015 UTC,"""...But if we attempt to talk about that - if women attempt to wrestle back control of the narrative of violence and its impact on women's lives - we are accused of misandry and sexism. We're chastised for not including caveats that remind people that 'not all men' are involved in this extensive war on women. ""   This article perfectly summarises my feelings when seeing any story about domestic violence (or even any story on violence against women) on reddit. I'd love to know what you guys think of the issue."
FemmeThoughts,35oyuu,annarchy8,36,Tue May 12 09:34:10 2015 UTC,"I like to think of what I see on reddit and most of the internet when the issue of violence against women comes up as the last violent flailings of the old dying societal power structure. There are many people in this world who think that feminism is determined to grab power for women while taking it away from men, much like there are still people who are convinced the civil rights movement will take away power from white people while giving power to minorities. These people are uneducated, immature, sometimes wilfully ignorant, and they remind me of a guy I dated who insisted that every interaction any human ever had was only ever about power. Me asking him to flush the toilet was all about power. Him throwing a tantrum because I wouldn't continue to explain a joke to death was all about power. When I said I didn't want to have sex, I was holding the ""power of the pussy"" over his head. I was not allowed to have any power, he had to maintain all of it. We could not be equal partners in any way. And then, when we broke up, he joined the army and got a taste of what it means to be powerless over your own life. I'm still waiting, years later, for some form of apology from him for his behavior.  I am sick and fucking tired of men who think the appropriate response to an article about violence against women is to cry ""but wut about the menz?!"" and/or rape and death threats or actual violence. They are muddying and derailing the conversations that could be had out of fear of losing a perceived power they are told they have. Nobody wins when one group gets privilege while everyone else suffers. Fairness and equality are not bad words or horrors hiding under the beds of innocents. If we rename the feminist movement to something more palatable to men, like ""egalitarianism"", they will find another sticking point to complain about. And, really, it all stems from people who are so attached to one part of their bodies that they can't see anything past that member. I am forced to focus on my gender because half the world's population is convinced that I envy penises so much I want to lop all of them off and must be put in my place (somewhere way beneath them) just in case I ever get a sharp object in my hands.   Sorry, that was long and rambling."
FemmeThoughts,35oyuu,fraulien_buzz_kill,6,Tue May 12 14:52:40 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I am so sorry you had to go through that horrible experience. Your explanation of the meaning of ""power of the pussy"" is so spot on and infuriating.    ""They are muddying and derailing the conversations that could be had out of fear of losing a perceived power they are told they have.""  THIS.  One big diversion tactic I see on reddit is that, when there is a story about rape, men immediately bring up false rape statistics.  Which is fine as another conversation, I guess, but has nothing to do with the conversation on rape victims.  It's like they want to think that 2 men out of a hundred being falsely accused of rape is the equivalent of 98 women actually having been raped.  98 rapists, and the conversation just has to be about the 2 poor good eggs in there (not even to go into the wiggliness of this 2% number, which is reported based on ""unfounded"" label determined independently by police stations, and with the fact that most only suffer a ""ruined reputation"" at most).  Also, it's the same rate of any other false reported crime!  When someone posts ""my car got stolen"", a whole bunch of people don't know up and say ""insurance fraud!""    And in the threads on false rape, and on reddit in general, men just say every kind of horrible thing about women with impunity- all women are manipulative cunts and liars and rape pretenders, and all girls are cheaters, and what about the pussy pass, and look at all these videos of women getting hit by men- now that's justice, equal fights for equal right!- and feminism is the problem, and women get special treatment at work, and women get special treatment all the time- but see we're good guys because we're trying to protect you see?- and trying not to have sex with drunk girls is just so hard, it's unfair, it's those damn feminazis who don't know what real rape is, why should their inability to consent make this rape?  Why isn't it not rape because I don't think it's rape?  But if you make a frank comment about being afraid of violence against you, and it's all, but NOT ALL MEN!    Uh... that got kind of angry.  I live with 3 guys who all spout this bullshit too, so I just have been really pent up about it lately.

He was talking about how women need to acknowledge that gender inequality is their fault as well at times. A couple of my mutual followers and I explained to him the harassment women are subjected to in public places, and if a woman gets the advantage to cut in queues and avoid that, then it's completely okay to allow her it.

FemmeThoughts,35qm5d,gmule,12,Tue May 12 20:51:57 2015 UTC,"Hydro One is a government owned corporation, essentially a state-owned public utility.  The firing won't be successfully challenged in court, free speech doesn't give a person immunity from consequences, only from criminal prosecution.  The employee in question essentially works for the government, and whether or not they're a representative of the civil service in this situation is irrelevant, they expressed views in a public forum that could be considered hostile to their co-workers and to the public that they serve in their job, and their termination is wholly justified in that context.  Tell those assclowns who like to talk about free speech to get an education.  Free speech doesn't mean I can't call you an asshole, and it doesn't mean I can't fire you for expressing views that are hostile or bigoted towards certain groups of people.  It just means that the state can't send you to jail over it."

FemmeThoughts,35qm5d,gmule,7,Tue May 12 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"There's a big difference, and libertarian types/free speech fanatics don't really like to read at all about reasonable limits of free speech and why they exist.  The general idea though is that religion is protected (but in a limited way) because of a number of reasons.  It's protected in the interests of allowing people free exercise of religion, in a historical context of minority religious views being persecuted, it's protected because if it isn't, then a particular religion will inevitably become favoured, which goes against the principles of separation between church and state (I'm Canadian so the exact separation isn't nearly as enshrined in law as it is for Americans, but it still exists), and it's also something that has a cultural attachment to it, such that punishing someone for their views is akin to diminishing their culture and religion as being lesser.  To contrast that with opinions that are bigoted, religion doesn't inherently suggest or state that others are less worthy of respect, while bigotry does by definition.  Bigoted opinions are ones that by their very nature oppose the dignity of other people, people who may also work in the same environment, or who may be the customers or clients of that business.  Religion may share those qualities, and in cases where religion leads to bigotry (until recent SCOTUS rulings in certain contexts) those religious viewpoints specifically are not protected; however it's not an inherent quality of religion that it is bigoted or hateful towards other individuals.  Christians of the same church have varying opinions about other groups, whether they be other Christian denominations/sects, non-Christians, or atheists, or whether they be homosexuals, or women or any other group or class, but it can't be said that Christians by default are misogynists, or that they hate Muslims, or even that Catholics specifically hold those views, since it's not at all an inherent viewpoint that's tied to those religions as a whole."

And lastly, my husband and I refused to start our marriage in debt, so we saved up $6,000 and paid for our wedding in cash.   The wedding industry is atrocious and all those statistics you see about the average wedding costing $20k a year are self-reported from the same white, upper-middle-class brides who read traditional bridal magazines.

I also can't think of a truly body-positive way to frame losing weight except for the sake of ""health"".    If ""being healthy"" (and whatever that means, be it fiction or a real thing for individual people) isn't enough, then yeah... I am not sure what the answer is.  Maybe there's a way to frame it in the sense of feeling good about accomplishing a difficult goal. Set a fitness goal and accomplish it just for the sake of doing it, rather than for the ""weight loss"" or the ""health"". It could be something like ""I'd like to be able to lift x amount of lbs"" or ""i'd like to be able to run a mile without stopping"" or something like that rather than a weight goal.  I don't know. I just know that I feel really proud of myself when I complete Nanowrimo each year, and it's not because I like the novel that comes out of it, and it's also not because I think I'll be happier having completed the novel... it's the pride that comes with accomplishing a difficult goal."

Perhaps we can look at it by way of social vectors.  Consider hair for example: Black women are shamed for their natural hair and there is an overwhelming pressure to 'tame' and alter it to resemble White women's hair to appear 'professional'.  Black women can recognise this framework and still autonomously decide to straighten and adjust their hair in this way for whichever reasons they please. Despite following this social vector, its still a decision in which she has the power.  I think the issue is about de-politicising people's bodies such that they can do whatever they like with them. For some people, it would be a genuine, apolitical choice to gain muscle while lowering their BMI to achieve a visibly defined musculature regardless of functionality and 'health'. For other people, they might think, ""Why would you even bother?""  There's nothing inherently wrong with the direction in which a lot of our social vectors point; rather, its that they exist in the first place."

There's a lot of information at /r/keto and it's easy to stick to. If you have a doctor, you could talk about making a plan with them.   And of course, just because you're thinking about losing weight today doesn't mean you can't change your mind or start or stop whenever you like. You know?"
FemmeThoughts,35i8s2,midmitten,2,Sun May 10 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm hoping weight lifting will work.  I lost a lot of weight once doing cardio and weight lifting along with eating a healthy diet (I was hungry a lot, though, so let's assume it was also low calorie).  Right now, I do cardio and try to remind myself that its for mood and health but my weight is the highest its ever been. :( I don't really know what to do--a healthier diet probably won't happen been now (finals) and graduation.  One thing way I will try to approach it is by focusing on health. At school there are just way, way too many burgers and breakfast sandwiches, and way to few veggies. That type of high fat, high sugar diet is horrible for my intestinal bacteria and cholesterol levels, so I'm going to try to focus on heart health (like, think to myself ""I don't eat cupcakes because of the trans fats""--which I used to).   I know for my sanity that MFP is not the way to go. Maybe a food journal without calorie counts will encourage healthier habits, but not obsession?   Other people focus on hitting their veggie servings for the day, which is a positive, non-restrictive, non-shaming change."
FemmeThoughts,35i8s2,jrl2014,5,Sat May 23 18:20:56 2015 UTC,"I can think of another motivation besides body image and being ""healthy"". Some women work out because they want to be strong. If you can find motivation in achieving a physical task, like squatting X amount of weight or running X miles, then you'll go to the gym and eat protein and veggies to make your body awesome. On the way there you will likely also achieve body image goals because you will be using energy and creating muscle!  I highly recommend /r/xxfitness. Every discussion I have seen there has been helpful, encouraging, positive and often hilarious!"
FemmeThoughts,35i8s2,swishingwell,4,Sun May 10 22:32:12 2015 UTC,"I love my body the way it is. I'm 5'3"", about 145 lbs, size 8. I think I look great with or without clothes on and generally have a healthy body image.   Recently I decided I want to see what my body is capable of. I'm already pretty healthy, but what if I were able to transform my body into the absolute strongest and healthiest version it could be? What would I look like? How strong would I be? How long would I be able to sprint and race my dog? Would I be capable of riding my bike for 50 miles?  My body has been good to me. It's not about looking better, it's about discovering all my body's incredible powers."
FemmeThoughts,35i8s2,pooncartercash,4,Sun May 10 23:26:31 2015 UTC,"Before you get started, I'd read this article on why diets don't work. Understanding the science and psychology that's at play here is crucial.   I'd second /u/nashife's idea. Forgot about size and choose some fitness goal - whether it's a sport or lifting or running. Find something that works for you.  For healthy body image, this is what I recommend:   Get used to your body, especially your naked body. If you can be naked at home, try going naked more often. The problem is that you're surrounded by thousands and thousands of images of air brushed models every day. In comparison, when you see yourself you feel abnormal and ugly. You need to reverse that, and one way to do it is to spend more time admiring your naked body.  Lie to yourself. When you look in the mirror, tell yourself how awesome you look. Out loud. Seriously - it may feel like a lie, but if you keep it up your will start to believe it. It's pretty easy to brainwash yourself. Smile at yourself in the mirror too. Smile, and tell yourself how beautiful you are. Every day - more than once a day if you can. Make it a ritual, a habit. Stop looking at pictures of tiny models and change the images you're surrounded by. You can only partially control this, but you can do a lot. You can hang up posters or pictures around your room or house of a variety of amazing women who have ""unconventional"" bodies. Make a slideshow or screensaver. There are lots of awesome pinterest albums of that collect images like this. I'd suggest choosing images of women doing things - working in factories, playing sports, whatever. Images in which they are people and empowered, not objects to look at. Make sure the people in your life don't body police you - whether it's in a positive or negative way. You know that friend who asks if you're planning on losing weight, or obsesses over her body and drags you into it, or who compliments you by telling you how thin you look today - cut that out of your life. Either sit those people down and tell them that you need them to change their behaviour or just cut them out of your life. Even having just one person who does that mildly can hugely get to you.   Here's part of my story:  I knew about sizeism and fatphobia. I knew all the academic stuff. And yet I couldn't apply it to me personally. I put my life off over and over - to start once I was thinner. For totally unrelated reasons, I spent a fairly long bit of time alone. Not dating, working from home. And it was really an incredibly valuable experience. I was working on getting over some hugely toxic stuff and having that enormous expanse of space and time to figure myself out and be me - without being watched or judged or having to perform in any way - it was amazing.  And one of the things that happened was that I learned how to love my body, and being comfortable in it. I went from always wearing bras because clothing didn't look right otherwise (I have seriously huge boobs) to going bra free (which I discovered was more comfortable for me). I went from not being comfortable being naked in my own bathroom to having no issue walking around naked all day long - I didn't even care if the curtains were open. I went from someone who didn't go swimming because of bathing suit issues to someone totally comfortable swimming in a tiny pair of bottoms only.   I started to feel comfortable and confident. And when I stand on the edge of the pool, preparing to dive in, and I take a second to close my eyes, I now feel powerful and beautiful - not ashamed. And it's made other people see me the way I see myself.  It's also had a pretty huge effect on my sex life. Being confident is pretty sexy. And not just that, but not being ashamed of my body means that I don't try and contort myself or suck my stomach in, or tense up if a guy touches my stomach. That means that it's a lot easier to just have fun - for both of us. And I don't choose partners based solely on looks, but since becoming comfortable with my body I've dated some ridiculously good looking men. The kind of men that people say could ""have anyone"". (I absolutely abhor that phrase because people aren't possessions and looks don't determine value and different people find different looks attractive).   When I first got together with one of them (6'3"", classic dark and handsome and very cut), he kept mentioning how long he'd wanted me and how sexy I was and how he couldn't believe this was actually happening. We'd been friends and neighbours for awhile, and we went swimming together a lot. Which meant he'd seen every roll of fat and stretch mark and he'd probably seen them in a fair number of crazy unflattering positions. He didn't have a fetish for larger women, in fact, I wasn't his type at all (he generally goes for tall and willowy women, not short and round). But he found me sexy anyway, and a lot of that probably was because I wasn't obsessing about how I looked. When I got out of the pool to dive, I wasn't thinking about how fat I was or trying to walk in a way to appear slimmer or trying to hide anything. I was just thinking about how awesome the air felt and how much I loved diving. When I stopped and grinned at him before diving in, I wasn't thinking about my body or if I appeared attractive to him - I was happy and enjoying his company and so I smiled.  When you're insecure with how you look, that takes up an enormous amount of mental real estate. You see circles and fat rolls and stretch marks and they seem so glaringly obvious to you that you constantly worry about covering and minimising. And that can really get in the way of doing and feeling and living.  And on the flipside, about a year into feeling really comfortable with how I looked, I made friends with someone who is obsessed with size. Her own, mine, everyone's. She constantly comments on how thin people look, or how fat she feels. She refuses to sit or lie down in any position that will give her rolls. And after spending a few weeks with her I felt incredibly self conscious and bad about my body. She's a lovely person, but being around her and her obsession with size was terribly toxic for me.  You can get past your bad body image, you can train your brain to love yourself. But it takes works and time. And you have to be mindful of the people and images you surround yourself with, because they train your brain too. Reprogramming your brain in this way is not easy - but if you stick to it and keep it up, it's incredibly rewarding.  Best of luck."
FemmeThoughts,35i8s2,foggygray,2,Mon May 11 00:48:26 2015 UTC,"I feel your struggle! My story is almost exactly the same.  I've been a chubby since I hit puberty and when I was 14/15 I got into a really bad funk where I restricted my eating. I was around 12 stone and spent 6 days fasting - literally only having water. Obviously that was totally unhealthy, and I ended it when I realised the reason I was doing it was because others criticised me about my weight.   Now at 19 I follow the whole ""I'm should lose weight to be healthier and happier!"" line of thought whenever I begin the next yo-yo diet, but it always ends because I think ""I don't feel super unhealthy, I don't think I should conform!"". It's such a weird cycle to go through and is SO frustrating. Losing weight could result in more confidence but I always think I should be confident at any size...  I unfortunately don't have an answer for you but I felt I should comment just to let you know I understand. I have tried to explain your line of thought to my SO many many times to no avail haha - I should show him this post."
FemmeThoughts,35i8s2,SimoneJnr,2,Sun May 10 21:31:30 2015 UTC,"That's a good question, and I'm sure my answer will only be one of many. That said, try to see your body image and weight loss as mutually exclusive. They are two different things and changing one won't change the other. If you already have a negative body image, losing weight won't necessarily give you a positive one. Every body is a good body, whether you're plus size, skinny, black, white, republican, whatever. That said, losing weight is still a perfectly valid thing to want to do. Just make sure you're doing it for the right reasons, namely yourself. Want to get in shape? Great. There will be many moments when you'll realize that you're stronger than you thought you were, and that's a wonderful thing. I think what's important about losing weight is to remember that it's not about hitting a number on a scale, nor is it about conforming to some ideal of beauty blah blah blah. You know that. But losing weight to make yourself proud is something else. Then you're doing something difficult and succeeding! And that will improve your self-confidence, which is awesome. Hope this helps."
FemmeThoughts,35i8s2,flyingjalapeno,2,Sun May 10 21:44:48 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm someone who lost a decent amount of weight (went from 185 lbs to 135 lbs, currently 140 somethingish @ 5'3""), so maybe I can provide some insight from my perspective on motivation.  My motivation wasn't that I wanted to be fat anymore, or to be super duper skinny. It was that I wanted to change myself into what I thought of as being my ideal person. Yes, this ideal person I've constructed is probably influenced by a thousand things outside of my control. But it doesn't matter because its what I want and it makes me happy. Personally my ideal person isn't really thin (like at 110 lbs or something), but has a little cushion (seriously winter is so much colder now that I've lost weight). My ideal person also has other things besides being a certain weightlevel: considerate, kind, brave, loyal, determined, aware of self and others, compassionate, fierce eyebrows, bold lip colors, execellent pun deliverer. I think I have a lot of these qualities, but I strive towards them everyday. Some of them fall in line with stereotypical qualities women have, but I don't care about that because I think they are important. So if you think its important lose weight and have a smaller body, then go for it and say screw it to size-ism and fat hate and all that crap because not once did I say that there should ever be hate towards the current person you are, simply to look forward to being the ideal person you want to be."

FemmeThoughts,35i8s2,The_Bombardier,1 point,Mon May 11 03:18:36 2015 UTC,"I used to weigh 300 lbs back in the day (by that I mean about five years ago I started on a weightloss journey that was founded on my self hate and low self esteem) and now I'm still hovering around 235, which is admittedly not as light as I would like to be.  For me, I take every opportunity to look at my body naked in the mirror.  At first it was difficult because in my head I would think of Victoria's Secret models and even plus sized airbrushed photoshop beauties bereft of the rolls and stretch marks that my body is riddled with, but still I would look at myself and remind me that I am still a worthy individual, I would think of the times I've had sexual partners who called me sexy or beautiful, I would think of the compliments given by family members and strangers.  Sometimes looking at myself naked is like trying to discern an MC Escher drawing, sometimes I look and look until looking becomes meaningless.  I realized that this is the only vessel I will ever own, love it or hate it, so why not choose to love it unapologetically?  (But I also come from a school of thought that all love is a choice)  The next step was to tie my health goals to motivations that are not weight-related.  For instance, I would eat less because I don't like how I felt sick after eating a pack of Oreos to myself.  I feel better when I eat that salad loaded with avocado.  I go to the gym because the treadmill is my anti anxiety, it helps me feel powerful lifting weights and it's an excellent way for me to blow off steam.    In this way, weightloss becomes a secondary benefit of becoming healthy.  Just remember that you are absolutely beautiful the way you already are now, you don't need to be skinny for anyone, it is not a requirement for being a great person or a great woman, and don't get yourself down over not looking a certain way because appearance is the most temporary attribute you possess.  Hope that helps 😜"

I agree with your specific statement, but I wonder at what point can we know if it's ethical? Like I became really friendly with the salon owners/workers at the salon I went to during college. Their prices were affordable, but definitely more than $10/mani or $19/mani-pedi, plus in a smaller city with a low cost-of-living. They spoke accented English, but they all spoke great English.  I want to be able to support ethical salon practices without essentially discriminating against Korean or Vietnamese salons by only going to spa-salons run by white people.   This whole thing has definitely been eye-opening, and I hope to learn more about how to spot shady practices outside of metropolitan areas."

However, I do hold that a lot of the rhetoric surrounding my beliefs contained very sexist attitudes towards women. I firmly believed in no sex before marriage, so there was this subliminal idea that these problems could be prevented if people just didn't have sex. Of course I didn't really consider the man having sex (because he wasn't having the abortion), it was a very anti-woman thought that I didn't even realize I was having. I know that my thoughts and attitudes have changed surrounding abortion directly in correlation to my education about oppression and discrimination against women. Even though I still feel a deep deep sympathy and understanding with pro-lifers on the level of true fear and sadness I felt for unborn children, I can now see how anti-abortion sentiments contribute more to systematic oppression of women than they do to saving children."

I am the one who was left to constantly question a guy's friendliness or interest in me. I am the one who is left feeling uncomfortable and having anxiety when a guy maintains too direct of an eye contact or is too encouraging and friendly.   But I just simply forgave those who assaulted me, and thought that they are only human.   When you are dealing with trauma, they tell you how forgiving too quickly can prevent you from healing. I think it's important to realize how unfair it was for those men to take advantage of me, to push me into something when I wasn't ready, to trick me, to proceed when I told them no.

But the starting point should be ""hey, if you're really worried about this, you should try Y; it'll work better than X"", not ""what sort of idiot does X, that's fucking stupid"".  If all you have is snark and sneering disdain for people who've ""never been in a fight"" then you're not really contributing anything to this thread or this sub, and you can fuck right off.   TL;DR:  Be helpful; don't stand on the sidelines being cynical and invalidating people's feelings."

FemmeThoughts,3569vs,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,18,Fri May 8 10:22:55 2015 UTC,"lawful good people   Damn Paladins, always ruining everything.  On a serious note, though, it's true that most forms of self-defense, whether some form of protective gear, weapon or training, goes out the window the moment you get into an actual fight. I studied a couple of martial arts, Aikido and Eskrima, and let me tell you that when you fear for your life, when you get punched, feel that adrenaline coursing through you almost everything is forgotten.  Your stance, the technique, how to do this or that. You're scrambling for your life and almost everything is reactive. You really have to train for years and years, making your body react automatically, for it to have any real effect.  A friend of mine, in fact, who a few years ago had his own Dojo, said that he broke his father's arm, and his fiancé's nose on separate occasions because he was coming home late to his house and was either touched, or grabbed in greeting in the dark and he reacted out of pure reflex. He told me that's what that kind of training does to you, it forces you to react that way. It's pretty brutal :<"

FemmeThoughts,3524th,bluebogle,14,Wed May 6 19:41:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. When you, no matter who you are, get picked up by a company like Marvel, there are going to be a ton of demands (like ""hey, there needs to be a love story. Every movie needs a love story"") and directors can either comply and try their best to still make a great film that represents their ideals as best they can, or they'll get replaced by someone else who will do what the execs want. I see it all the time (I work in the industry). I have a feeling had someone else directed, Black Widow would have been a much weaker character."

For somebody like me to argue with a bunch of people who wanted Clint and Natasha to get together [in the second Avengers film], not so much. For someone like me even to argue about feminism — it’s not a huge win. Because ultimately I’m just a rich, straight, white guy. You don’t really change people’s minds through a tweet. You change it through your actions. The action of Anita being there and going through that and getting through that and women like her — that says a lot.”"

FemmeThoughts,351rtk,Quouar,18,Wed May 6 11:49:11 2015 UTC,"God, I love Joss and Black Widow, I think she's an incredible character.    “Haven’t we gotten to a point where the one lonely female superhero in our current landscape can just pursue the business of avenging without having to bemoan not being a mother?”   This really bothers me however. Natasha is upset because her choice in direction of life has been torn from her and she had absolutely no choice in anything that happened to her. When people say things like in that quote, they inadvertently let slip that they think femininity is lesser or does not have a equal value to masculine traits in my opinion. This is something unique to women and to just say something like that without any regard to context is very telling to me because it shows that you didn't even bother to look at the context or to consider why she's upset, just that it's silly or not worth her being upset."

I also think that she is not drawing her ""monster"" conclusion from being sterilized but from being honed into an assassin and used sterility as an emphasis for how she was made to be an assassin and only an assassin, as well as being able to relate to Bruce."
FemmeThoughts,351rtk,Craylee,8,Thu May 7 00:48:57 2015 UTC,"If Black Widow wasn't Black Widow, and was another of Joss Whedon's OCs, I doubt many would have a problem with how she was handled in AoU. The problem, IMO, was that he took her out of character in a number of ways, as well as twisted her canon material to make a fairly insignificant portion of the character's backstory into a large part (and subsequently used that part to have BW proclaim herself as a monster, in part to aid the tension between her and hulk, and to aid in padding the narrative where nearly every hero proclaims themselves as potential monsters in the face of Ultron's plans against them...not quite something I felt was necessary).   There's nothing wrong with what Joss Whedon wrote BW into in AoU, there's nothing wrong with wanting what he did to that character, but in the spirit of accuracy, it was wrong. So it really comes down to deciding whether a person prefers the OOC black Widow Whedon wrote, or the more accurate versions in the past. Personally, I choose the more accurate versions, because i love Black Widow's character, and I can always watch Buffy or Dollhouse if I want to see another character like the AoU Black Widow. In a film where more than enough canon was twisted far out of the norm already, I would have preferred BW remain.   I can only hope in the future films that the writers more or less retcon this and return her to her former glory, and maybe then we'll all have what we wanted, AoU remaining a happy turn of character for those who desired it, and the rest of the larger narrative providing something a bit more true to the core character at hand."
FemmeThoughts,351rtk,lockedge,2,Wed May 6 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"I really think this article hits the nail on the head, particularly about Natasha's infertility. So many critiques have been focused on how she shouldn't care and I felt like it demonized a part of the female experience (and some do not, and both are valid)."
FemmeThoughts,351rtk,slothcough,5,Wed May 6 15:00:38 2015 UTC,I completely agree. It's a bit in the same vein as the bra article that was posted yesterday. There are many different expressions of femininity. The fact that Natasha is upset by her infertility doesn't make her any less of a woman or any less of a character.
FemmeThoughts,351rtk,Rum_Pirate_SC,13,Wed May 6 15:14:48 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it has to also do with the fact that there is a lot of backlash towards women who either do not want, or can't have kids. (Gods if I had a dollar for every time I'm told I don't know true love, or am not really a whole woman because I can't have kids... sighs anyways..)   That we really do want to see a strong female character who is OK with not being able to have a child..  be it her own choice, or not.  I do agree though, that Natasha being upset that she can't have kids doesn't make her any less of a woman, however.. neither does being OK with not being able to have kids.  Yet we're constantly reminded that we're supposed to want kids, that we're broken if we don't want them/can't have them.  So I can't blame people who are in that same boat being let down at seeing someone they identify with lamenting over it when they were hoping to see some glimmer that it's just as fine to be strong, infertile, and ok with it.   But regardless my point of view.. I didn't see Natasha any less of a woman for lamenting.  She's still a kick ass super heroine!  What I AM pissed off with the most is the lack of merchandise for her!!"
FemmeThoughts,351rtk,Rum_Pirate_SC,3,Wed May 6 19:13:52 2015 UTC,"I can absolutely agree with the sentiment of wanting a female figure who is okay with not having kids, or who actively seeks not having children. There is a distinct lack of them, and I agree, that children are seen as a fundamental part of a woman's ability to be a woman. It's bad. But I don't think that desire for greater representation of what a woman is should detract from actual characters' and actual women's desires for children, or lamentations over sterility."

FemmeThoughts,34z4u3,meanttolive,17,Tue May 5 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"Right, I agree.  I think the only thing I might add, however, is that it isn't always really a freely made choice if there are direct consequences to choosing ""wrong""- in this case, being ogled, harassed, or judged for having nipples show.  Maybe if we all banded together things would change- like with wearing pants!- but it's still too bad that the first generation to choose has to bear consequences.  It would be nice- although it's probably not realistic to expect this- if instead, the culture as a whole could change before or with this movement, rather than after it."

How to support female atheists, how to help women escape the 'abusive relationship' that is religion (or at least organised religion). Why they should want to. About 3/4 of the way through, there's something which I thought was really important which was a general list of ways to support women (or any minority) at an atheist event (or any other event).

FemmeThoughts,34r3pq,PandaSymposium,3,Tue May 5 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not a new idea. There are quite a few feminist theologians who have looked at these texts and tried to tackle or reclaim them. Sallie McFague is famous for it. What I find interesting about it, though, is that there is this definite acknowledgement that religion and religious texts can definitely be perceived as anti-woman when viewed through a certain lens, but are so malleable that they can also be reclaimed. I guess the question really comes down to whether it's religious texts or religious institution that determines the character of religious beliefs."

They choose what they believe, and whether that comes from whatever source or 'authority' depends entirely on an individual basis. What should happen, and how we should categorise the beliefs of a religion as a monolithic entity is to suggest that a religion is a philosophical school, rather than political movement. Of course, the two aren't mutually exclusive, but I think most religions that we discuss are too large and varied to fit within any one school."

My SO calls it one of the most acerbic and nasty subs he's ever seen. It stops being about feeling good about oneself and just more about outright hatred for some people who have the audacity to feel comfortable and pretty in their skin."
FemmeThoughts,34ksix,gizumi,9,Sat May 2 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you're saying, these subs make me incredibly sad!  That being said, I find your description of of that thread's OP as having a ""tiny flat stick body"" problematic as well. I understand the temptation of responding to an insult in kind but thin-shaming is a weak defense against fat-shaming."
FemmeThoughts,34ksix,Spriq,2,Sun May 3 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"No, you're right about that. I hadn't meant it to be insulting but I was quite emotionally charged writing that out so I see how clumsily I handled that.   It just bothers me a lot that people hold one body type over another because I honestly cannot see any real advantages of doing so. A thin person has just as many flaws as a fat person, and when people claim that thin waifs have the most perfect body I feel the need to take them down a notch and say, no, it's just a body. A human, imperfect body. Beautiful? Sure. Healthy? Possibly. But those answers apply equally to any other body type, too, don't they?"
FemmeThoughts,34ksix,gizumi,2,Sun May 3 14:42:28 2015 UTC,"What always flummoxes me is how people don't seem to understand that beauty is mostly an arbitrary concept, hugely influenced by societal mechanisms.  Different regions and different times have/had different ideals of beauty, most of which are based on scarcity:  You live in a society where most people have office jobs and don't have time to be outside? A nice tan is attractive. Live in a society where the majority works outside everyday? A pale complexion is attractive. Live in a society where nutrition is scarce? Heavy people are attractive. Live in a society where nutrition is plenty and cheap? Thinness is attractive.   Knowing all this, most of us still seem unable or unwilling to accept that our notions of beauty are just that - notions, moving targets, influenced by what everyone arounds us finds attractive. Not only do we seem unable to accept this, many of us turn the concept up to eleven - proclaiming that beauty (a fleeting attribute at best) is the only thing to be valued in a partner, while the content of someone's character (more enduring and, I'd argue, ultimately the most important thing if you want to be with them) is being relegated to ""oh also, they're nice I guess"". Crazy, when you think about it.  Thing is, I would never want for someone to have to change what they find attractive, it's everybody's prerogative to like what they like, but these subs are designed to target people those users find unattractive because they're not attracted to them! Why would anyone expend the energy to hate something/someone they're not affected by? It's sort of the same thing as with straight people who fight gay rights: ""Oh, you're not attracted to members of your own gender? The don't date them! Why do you care what they do?  And it's in following that question that the anger I feel over what's happening in those subs mixes with pity. Because the answer to that question is. ""You don't care. And if you do there's probably something wrong with you.""   Ever so often when a post from fatpeoplehate or ImGoingToHellForThis or some equivalent subreddit hits a top spot in all I go and have a look at the discussion, find a user spewing particularly rabid hate and check out their post history. Know what I find? Lots and lots of self-hatred. I think fatpeoplehate especially is mostly made up of (often shockingly young) kids who either are heavy and browse the sub hoping that the self-hatred it inspires will help them lose weight, or kids who were heavy and can't reconcile that part of their past with their ideology in any other way but by ridiculing others (as avatars of themselves, you see this happen a lot with ex smokers too).   A few times I stumbled upon kids who also posted in thinspo subs (communities that encourage each other in their anorexic disorders). One of those kids confessed in such a sub that she used fatpeoplehate as a way to prolong the time until she finally had to cave and eat something... I'm sure if you pulled more of these threads you'd find even worse stuff... I think we can agree that hating someone for something which doesn't affect you is not really the behaviour of a happy and healthy mind. Sad.   Sorry this turned into a novel, I guess it was just something I had been thinking about for quite some time..."

I don't mean to skinny shame, but some of those girls doing the shaming, look unhealthily thin. And this is coming from a girl who is said to be ""skinny"". I am thoroughly disturbed."
FemmeThoughts,34ksix,MissMaster,2,Sat May 2 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"That's part of their disease.  They equate being thin with being healthy, but many of them never exercise and smoke like chimneys (from reading their comment histories).  It's not about being fit (which is what they say), it's about being their idea of pretty.  Notice that the majority of the posts there are of women?  The men there don't hate fat women because they are unhealthy, they hate fat women because anything they don't want to fuck is a waste of human space."
FemmeThoughts,34ksix,MissMaster,1 point,Mon May 4 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"So one of my main problems with that sub (despite it's reason for existing) is that they think nothing of blurring their own face, but show the face of the person they are making fun of.  Did you know there is a shitladyTrollX?  ""For the ladies of fatpeoplehate"".  They are currently having sub drama over the amount of loud and proud fat shaming going on over there.  One of the posts over there right now is ""Poor me, my boyfriend is upset that I'm mean to fat people""  Well, no shit!  You're mean!  Who wants to be with someone who is proud of being mean to strangers?  What I don't understand is that these people equate being thin with being healthy.  I looked into the comment history of one of these 'shitlords' (who voluntarily calls themselves that, btw?) and he readily admitted he was a smoker and joined a gym two months prior but hadn't even gone yet because he was intimidated by all the fit people there and didn't want to be embarrassed benching just the bar.  I wonder if he stopped to think that ... gasp ... fat people feel the same kind of intimidation and fear.  Most of the people there are NOT fit, they are just skinny.  I have to believe it's some kind of pro-Ana thing because I can't imagine people being that obsessed with being so vicious to strangers."
FemmeThoughts,34l93l,MagicalZeuscat,16,Sat May 2 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know... Imo, it still sets out to separate the men from the women. Not to say it isn't a good thing to point out and acknowledge those differences, as it can lead to awareness in inequality and such, but nevertheless it still implies that ""women are marked from the default man.""  This campaign doesn't stop to think about how much the ""male"" bathroom signs are used in so many more applications than just marking gendered restrooms. No matter whether it's a cape or a dress, women are still inherently ""different"", ""separate"", and ""not normal"" when compared to a normal human being (aka a man), regardless of whether it's ""Women are better than men"" or ""women always wear dresses""."
FemmeThoughts,34l93l,gizumi,8,Sat May 2 16:55:44 2015 UTC,"Even in the colored in cape version, it's ""generic man symbol"" vs. ""curvy lady because women are different from the default""."
FemmeThoughts,34l93l,SomeOldGoat,2,Sat May 2 18:41:28 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what do you see as the ideal solution? Should sexes be separated out? If so, how can it be done simply without establishing one as the default and one as the variation?"
FemmeThoughts,34l93l,Quouar,2,Sun May 3 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"Well, let's look at it another way. If we examine Old English, we'd find three words: mann, werman, and wyfman, right? Werman was used to refer to men, Wyfman was used to refer to women, and mann was just used for non-gender-specific people. Eventually as English evolved, wer- was restricted only to werewolf and the like, wyfman was changed to wife and woman, and man became exlusively men (but of course also for all people ex. mankind).   Similarly, the real question is, why isn't there a marked version just for men? If we're looking at bathroom signs, why don't we just have a picture of a toilet and get rid of gender-specific bathrooms that are potentially dangerous for trans* people?  Here's an interesting article exemplifying gendered signs in other parts of life, and just how marked it is to have a woman shown, and why it's so troublesome to create a distinctly male version when men are already seen as default people."
FemmeThoughts,34l93l,gizumi,2,Sun May 3 05:08:05 2015 UTC,"I've seen ones that look almost like someone swooped a paintbrush up the sign for women (so it was larger on the bottom) and down for men (so it was larger at the top), and added dots for heads above them. I thought that was quite a good way of doing it. Looked a bit dated, though."

Because trans people do face harassment and assault for using bathrooms of their identified gender. There are a lot of other sources that show that, as well. Unisex bathrooms get rid of that problem."

FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,purplebadger9,31,Fri May 1 05:49:53 2015 UTC,"I have to admit I don't remember that part too well but what I got out of it is that she feels incomplete because of her inability to have children but that's just another thing to add to her mental ""I am a monster, I'm not worthy"" list. A list that includes her training, missions and multiple homicides.  She recognises it was the logical thing to do in order to create the perfect weapon and I think that's what she resents the most: that they took yet another piece of her away forever. The people who made her who she is stripped her of her innocence, of her childhood and of a normal life and that's what she longs for. She can't have her childhood back and because of everything she's done she doesn't feel like she's worthy of a peaceful future. Yet she looks around her and sees Burton, the closest to her, with a loving wife, a nice place and bunch of kids and he somehow seems able to make it all work even through alien invasions and evil, genocide prone AIs.   Of course she's going to wonder how he does that and what it would be like if it were here in his shoes. That's until she remembers she could never be in his shoes anyway because they took the ability to conceive away from here and in kicks the self hatred.  I felt like it was more a matter of feeling inadequate compared to the situation rather than feeling she wasn't a ""real"" woman simply because she couldn't have children. At least that's what I got out of it. What's good in any case is that she doesn't pass this judgment on to all of womankind, it's only in regards to herself."

FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,sigma83,11,Fri May 1 17:15:46 2015 UTC,"I work on a TV show and nearly every script I turned in early on had the following exchange:  Director: sigma83, I think you need to cut this portion.   sigma83: but it's really important! It adds back story and character nuance! It's a really important moment for this character's developmental arc!   Director: it doesn't fit with the theme of the episode and it's messing with the pacing. Save it for later in the season or find a more visual way to tell the story. Faster.   ...and she was always right, damn her.   Whedon is a TV writer. He's used to having entire seasons and tons of dialogue to tell his stories. I know that doesn't explain why he made those specific decisions, I just had a thought as to why they even exist."

FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,sigma83,4,Sat May 2 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"I work in animation, so that's nooot quite the same thing.  However, the storyboarders and the director often come up with the specifics for action sequences, camera, etc. The ones I try to focus on are character acting (character rolling their eyes, e.g., is a great storytelling method because it's quick visual shorthand) or if I need a specific thing to be in frame because it's important somehow.  It's also different per show. Every show I've ever worked on has been different. But generally speaking, yes. Less of the descriptions unless it's very important to the character/scene that they be there."

FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,DarthLolita,12,Sat May 2 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't interpret that line the way it appears everyone else did.  Black Widow gave up her ability to create life so that she could take lives more efficiently. I'd feel like a monster, too, in her shoes, and I myself have absolutely no desire for children.  I'm just as pro-lady as any other sane person, but I can't make myself to see anti-woman agendas where there aren't any. It seems like Age of Ultron has generated a lot of baseless and unnecessary controversy on feminist blogs and the like.  As for what I thought of the movie as a whole, I loved every second of it and I'm going to see it again today. Also, Scarlet Witch is my new superhero girl crush. Never cared much for her in a lot of comics (no idea why), but Elizabeth Olson sold me."
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,Confusedandlost123,8,Fri May 1 15:55:18 2015 UTC,"The first time I watched it that's exactly how I read that scene. She was trained to kill as efficiently as possible and that meant giving up anything that can be seen as a distraction. I thought she was calling herself a monster for concentrating on nothing but her next assignment and killing.  I feel it's unlikely I'll ever have kids as each year ticks by and I don't feel the urge. Many people have made me feel insulted and incomplete by implying or explicitly stating women without kids are somehow wrong but that scene in this film wasn't one of those occasions. It honestly didn't occur to me people read it the other way until I read the backlash!   Second time around ok, I realised it was sloppily worded but I think my original interpretation stands. The script was a bit of a mess in a few places and this was one of them."
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,SomeOldGoat,13,Fri May 1 20:25:39 2015 UTC,"It does bother me and actually gave me major Twilight flashbacks. In the last two books, there's a major emphasis on how broken and empty infertile women are. One girl who's a vampire hates being one because she can't have children and it makes her bitter and resentful toward a human main character. Then there's a werewolf girl (the only one since the rest of the pack is all guys) who also says she's broken because of this, and that her werewolf nature is connected to her infertility. Basically, they both seem to view themselves as monsters and/or incomplete because of this, and so the last book is spent glorifying a risky pregnancy and motherhood in general.  I never thought Joss Whedon would end up reminding me of Stephenie Meyer, but he did. Maybe there's more reason here, maybe there isn't. But while I still love Whedon and still really liked Avengers 2. I hate that component equally. I know infertility is really difficult for certain women and it pains them a lot to have to struggle with it, but in fiction, it's like there's practically no women who don't want children. Can't we have character arcs/struggles outside our Typical Woman Roles?"
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,Confusedandlost123,9,Fri May 1 11:20:29 2015 UTC,"At the same time, isn't it also completely acceptable that some women would feel incomplete and 'odd one out' for that?  I can't have a baby, and if that was something I never wanted to do, it would be one thing, but having to look on while my wife was pregnant was one of the hardest things for me. I love her, I live our kids, but it's lying to say that it didn't make me feel incomplete, or sometimes unworthy of being called 'mom'  It's great for those who can look past it, or who don't care, but biology drives how a lot of us think, and feel.   It's great to show women who aren't defined by being able to have kids and who are strong, and defined by those strengths, but we also need to recognise and show women who are defined by their desire to be homemakers, and the emotions of those with that desire who are incapable of doing so.  Some of us fit the social norm, and some of us WISH we fit the social norm. That desire does define a part of the black widow character, and that should be OK. Just because a good portion of us reject those norms, or don't define ourselves as people based on those norms, doesn't mean we should reject people and their portrayals, because they are defined by those norms  Celebrate the mosaic, don't try to force everyone against the current, IMO"
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,SomeOldGoat,7,Fri May 1 13:22:00 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm of two minds on this. I'm on board with your general ""celebrate the mosaic"" idea, but I think that applies a whole lot more with regards to actual humans in the actual world than it does to media representation. I think it's good to have women who want kids but are unable to have them and are dealing with that struggle represented, but women who plainly don't want and/or aren't interested in kids are still largely unseen in the media (and historically when they have been represented are like...Roald Dahl-esque villains)."
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,Confusedandlost123,3,Fri May 1 15:21:24 2015 UTC,"And yet within the marvel universe(movies) we have lots of those characters. Lady Sif, Melinda May, Pepper Potts, Agent Carter, etc.  That representation isn't absent in the MMU, it's the norm."

FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,WadeK,2,Fri May 1 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"For media at large, sure, but mosaic representation in the MMU has it's place. This isn't a new aspect to her character either. She is strong, but she is still a woman who should rather(now) settle and have a family"
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,LadysPrerogative,1 point,Fri May 1 15:54:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I was more responding to the general statement about media--I haven't seen Age of Ultron and suspect this won't especially bother me when I do. Frankly it seems like a not-unexpected addition to her character (generally wanting to have a family/normal life, that is) and I think will work fine for her particular situation."
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,annarchy8,3,Fri May 1 16:22:01 2015 UTC,"I thought the movie itself was about as feminist as a Hollywood blockbuster could get!  Both Scarlet Witch and Black Widow are HUGE parts of the story.  Sure, Widow gets kidnapped, but she ends up saving herself by transmitting her location to the others and kicking her rescuer out a trap door to force him to be more useful.  The sterilization thing was an amazing bit of acting by ScarJo, and it came right after Banner lamented his own inability to have kids.  So they both had the same little moment of sadness, except she gets the better monologue.    Heck, out of the couple, I would say that Hulk becomes the love interest and Widow becomes the plot-pusher.  She's the one making all the moves and decisions.  There's a scene where two men talk to each other about how great their women are.  To me, it felt like a direct poke at the Bechdel Test, or at least a giant wink.  The Korean doctor (name escapes me atm) was fantastic and ambitious while still having some moral dilemmas.  Is it better to continue my research and possibly better the world, or to say no to this bad guy?  She created the damn Vision, which is pretty freaking cool.  She's also the in-world replacement for Healing Factor, which is probably one of the more important and prolific superpowers in the Marvel universe.  Mrs Barton was the typical housewife in direct contrast to Widow and yet she's not a meek personality.  Just a mom, and it's perfectly okay for women to be stay at home moms.  She represents the ideal that none of the other Avengers can have.  Just a normal lady and normal kids (daughters, so more girls!) doing normal things and not being a part of the whole Save-The-World plot.  They can't even be used as hostages or bait like most other families would.  Scarlet Witch... omg.  I loved her SO MUCH.  Yes, she freaks out and needs to be talked down by Hawkeye.  But so what?  Tony had severe PTSD.  Banner constantly has to be talked down by Widow.  Cap was weak and unsure and needed that reassurance from both Erskin and Peggy.  All the heroes have at some point needed someone else to snap them out of their funk to get back into the fighting.  Why is it suddenly misogyny when Scarlet Witch needs it?  She eventually made the choice to get up and go do the thing she was so terrified to do, and doesn't choice define her character more than her moment of weakness?  This movie was amazing for women, and I love the fact that in the New Avengers at the very end, there's only one white male.  (Does Vision count? Maybe there's two).  GotG has only one white male.  Carol Danvers is about to blow shit up.  Black Panther is coming (and I've got my own tinfoil hat theories that he was in Ultron).  As far as diversity goes, Marvel has taken a HUGE step this past year to mix stuff up, despite the problems as far as solo movies and merchandise."
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,LinLeigh,3,Tue May 5 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"So I read that scene as more as a reference to Black Widow's life as an assassin and a spy, and everything that the Red Room took from her and molded her into. Taking her ability to make life and turning her into one who gives only death. However I was happy that there were five women who had prominent roles in the movie:  1) Black Widow 2) Scarlet Witch 3) Helen Cho 4) Maria Hill 5) Laura Barton And it passes the Bechdel test."
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,annarchy8,4,Sat May 2 03:29:50 2015 UTC,"Sheesh. [Spoilers] Season 2 of Orphan Black had a bombshell ending that included the knowledge that the clones were made sterile on purpose. It drives Rachel into a murderous frenzy because all she's ever wanted is children, apparently. She's heading a multinational corporation worth untold amounts of money, she raises an eyebrow and mountains move, but she's incomplete because she can't conceive. She's also cold and evil and would make a horrible mother, but her only goal in life is to make a baby. It's left me confused. The show is great at illustrating how important having agency over your own body is, but there's that sticking out like a sore thumb."
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,LinLeigh,4,Fri May 1 12:54:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I think it kinda tied in with her character.   She is obsessed by her childhood and her ""father"".

FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,annarchy8,0,Fri May 1 19:56:17 2015 UTC,"It may just be that I don't get it. But longing and murderous rage are kind of far apart.

She has spent decades yearning for her father. For the one time she was happy. And then she finds out that he is the reason she can never have a family.
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,annarchy8,1 point,Fri May 1 20:07:07 2015 UTC,You make good points. I never thought how close to the edge of completely losing it Rachel was.
FemmeThoughts,34hmqv,annarchy8,4,Fri May 1 20:24:39 2015 UTC,Well it is a horrible lazy trope. I find it hard to look at it in isolation.   In isolation I'm not just okay but can understand both the Rachel and Black Widow story line. But in terms of the wider media narrative it makes me sad that it is such a widely used trope with very little counterparts. So I can definitely understand your frustration.

People downvoted everything I said, probably without even looking at what I said. I didn't know so many people felt so strongly for keeping female characters looking like this: http://i.imgur.com/6b0iBeD.jpg while male characters get to look like this: http://i.imgur.com/JpstZ3r.jpg (they're both done by the same aforementioned FB guy)  Well at least that's how I found out about this place. I'm done with TwoX. That place really has gone to shit. I deleted the post and all my comments in it because people kept personally attacking me.

FemmeThoughts,34hdgr,umenohana,2,Fri May 1 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"What really interests me is that one of the people in your corner in that thread is one of the mods of 2X. Even she seems pretty dismayed at what happened there.   If you like it here, spread the word, that's all we ask (if you want. We're not very insistent). I'd love for more women to know there's more than just that one, toxic sub for women. The mods are doing a lot better, but I'm convinced there is simply no way to effectively stand up to the tide of redditry that comes with defaulting. Especially not if you cater to an already-marginalized group."
FemmeThoughts,34hdgr,Shmaesh,5,Fri May 1 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"Ooh! She was one of the two or three people in there actually saying things that made sense!! I was like, who is this wonderful, sane person? But I was using mobile so I didn't see that she's a mod.   Yeah, I know the TwoX mods say that maintaining a default sub status is fine because they delete (some of the) misogynistic messages in threads, but obviously that is not enough. We shouldn't have to waste time and energy reading and dealing with sexist vitriol when we should be having an actual discussion. I know that personally, it was absolutely heartbreaking to see that SO MANY people in a space that's supposed to be for women and their allies were verbally attacking me and others for pointing out that the sort of illustrations the artist creates perpetuates the already rampant sexism in games.   Somebody (a mod?) also claimed a while back that defaulting helps make TwoX not an echo chamber. What on earth? We weren't just screaming ""ECHO!"" into each other's vaginas before so that we could hear it echo off our vaginal walls. The women and men of TwoX were having much more civilized conversations about women's experiences and whatnot. Now they want to welcome all the dick-trumpet-tooting assholes from default so that they could silence us with their shrill, incessant blasting? I really liked it  before when I saw some of the men who went out of their way to join TwoX to better understand what the women in their lives are going through. That was awesome. Now it's just a depressing hellhole of misogyny over there.  The assholes in my thread even cried things like censorship. Do they realize the irony of their accusations? They bullied me into virtual silence! My post was downvoted to the point where it would have little to no visibility and they downvoted my comments so much that they'd get hidden! And yet they also wonder why there's a need for safe places for women and their feminist friends to talk online. It's because we can't have thoughtful, constructive discussions when they're screaming and flinging shit everywhere every time we mention feminist ideas!  Sorry for the heated rant; it just feels like they're just being stubborn for keeping TwoX a default at this point. I'm definitely gonna spread the word about this place."

It's frustrating, and it's important that we be able to verbalize what's wrong in order to be able to create and maintain a space without the same pitfalls.  We haven't had a 'here's why I left 2X' post in a long time, but for a while, that's basically all the community wanted to do. There's a lot of pent up reaction and anger out there, still.

First third of comic:   Panel 1: A woman, wearing a dark colored dress and jacket, is walking down the street carrying a white bag. A robber, wearing a mask and a black and white shirt, is seen eying the bag.  Panel 2: The robber makes for the bag, yelling “Ha!” while the woman looks at him in shock.  Panel 3: A close-up of the robber’s face; a hand is smacking his face, and he drops the bag.  Panel 4: The woman is angry, and tells off the robber. “Back off, Buster Brown.”  Panel 5: Woman is off-screen; we take a look at the robber.   Woman: “You try that again and I’ll ruffle your feathers so hard.”  Robber: *looking mad* “Whoa hey language.”  Panel 6: Again, woman is off-screen. The robber takes on an “ohhhh, I know this” look, with a grin. “Must be that time of the month, huh?”  Panel 7: We see the woman and the robber again. She looks really annoyed, while the robber is smug.  Woman: “WHAT?! No! I’m mad because you tried to rob me--”  Robber: “Don’t worry miss, your secret is safe with me!”    Second third of comic:  Panel 1: A woman is seen crying. In the foreground is a man with curly hair wearing square glasses and a T-shirt that says “band”.   Woman: “Boo hoo Carl, my mom just died! I’m so upset! Booohoo!”  Panel 2: Woman is off-screen; Carl has his hands up in a “back off” gesture. “Oh dang, check out the waterworks!”  Panel 3: Carl has a “ohhhh, I know this” look. “You’re on the rag, huh babe?”  Panel 4: Woman is seen in the panel looking shocked and really upset. Carl dismisses her, looking like a brat: “Well, tone it down a little Miss Hormones.”    Final third of comic:  Panel 1: A woman in a white collared dress has been shot in the abdomen. She’s looking at her wound in horror as a man looks on with his mouth open.   Woman: “OH GOD I’VE BEEN SHOT!”  Panel 2: The woman is off-scene; focus is on the man.   Man: “Wowza! Looks like the Red Tide has come in, eh? Aunt Flow visiting for the weekend?”  Panel 3: Man is off-screen now; the woman is going “what the fuck”. Her hands are bloody.  Woman: “What? Uh can you call an ambulance or something? I think I am dying.”  Panel 4: Woman is off-screen, focus is on the man. He stands there with his hands crossed, teasing her.  Man: “Need a tampon there, Bloody Mary?”  Panel 5: Just the man standing there now, eyes closed and laughing. Blood is splurting out on the bottom left corner of the panel.  Man: “HAHAHA I do not understand vaginas.”  Fin."

FemmeThoughts,34c9zu,Violent_Apathy,12,Thu Apr 30 00:18:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this information would be remotely useful, but in plastic surgery communities, particularly those for breast implants, it is extremely common for women who get implants to go through a phase where they dress very revealingly and sometimes inappropriately. Eventually the novelty wears off and all but it's a thing. When I read your post, I drew a parallel because I went through the same ""revealing clothes"" phase (I have implants) and not only did I have to learn how to dress appropriately again, I also had to adjust to how the new rack couldn't get away with things the old rack could. I went to a baby shower in a halter top that would've been tolerable on my old boobs, but on the new ones, I showed way too much cleavage and it stretched the fabric so you could see through it. Everyone else was dressed nicely. Awkward! I bring this up so you don't make the same mistake.  Be advised that a thin tank that nipples can be seen through is fine for a dude, or for wearing around the house among close family, etc. but in mixed company or social occasions, it will make people uncomfortable. And the rule holds for pretty much anyone, nobody really wants to have their roommate or friend sitting around with their junk hanging out. I'm sure you'd be a little weirded out if your roommate suddenly declared the living room pants-optional and ran around in see-through undies. It doesn't mean they have a problem with you."

Maybe he feels threatened in some form or fashion? I don't know, but maybe if he feels like the communication is open and that there's nothing to be scared of he'll chill out. Talk about WHY it makes him uncomfortable. If he doesn't chill, it's a good idea to maybe discuss boundaries of some form. Explain that you are not out to make him uncomfortable or out to flirt with him or whatever, but that you just want to exist somewhere you can be safe.

I get more harassment from the queer community than from straight people. I'd rather visit Chernobyl than spend any more time in our local queer community (particularly the lesbian community).  For decades, trans activists have been working to undo the damage caused by our so-called ""allies"". Funny how that history is so quickly erased."

I also live in a progressive city. It doesn't matter. I am starting to believe that cissexism is an integral part of the queer experience. I have been seeking queer spaces for the last couple years, and regardless of whether I am out or stealth, it's the same crap. My personal belief is that the queer community is the enemy. This comes from the fact that they have been quick to ditch us when anti-discrimination laws are getting stuck, and the long history of organized lesbian opposition to trans women.   My personal frustration are these blanket statements made by LGBPQ folks who will go on to say that ""oh, we look out for trans people"" when in reality, LGBPQ folks have a long history of organized and very effective opposition to trans people."

I would expect the same from any guy that I'm with...I'm interested in what turns them on, but whether or not to act on that is totally my decision.

To have shaved pits and legs forever, I would have to pretty much use up a razor a day, and that's about fifteen bucks a week. He gets that there are other things I would rather spend 800 bucks a year on. As well, it's tedious, sometimes painful, and cleaning up after takes forever. I do like to shave my legs sometimes, and I know he prefers them shaved, but he doesn't push it. (And if he asked me to shave my bush, that would be a no-go.

Because of that, I never felt the need to shave. Why should I go through the trouble to shave things no one can see?  My ex, on the other hand, found it repulsive. He kept making references to how unhygienic I was, how I never tried, how little effort I put in to make myself more attractive to him (all the little gifts and thoughtful artwork I painted for him was worthless lack of effort, obviously). It was my fault, you see, that he refused to kiss me 9 months in. This was my first boyfriend so I sighed and accepted that I was just going to have to get used to this. I had no idea how to shave, and I did it badly. Ingrown hairs everywhere, I would wake up crying in pain, and buying supplies was hurting my budget significantly.  I met a new guy, and when he stayed over I gathered my supplies and complained a little about how troublesome shaving was, but at least he wouldn't have to put up with my gross hair. He stared at me for a few moments and asked, ""Why would I care if you have hair or not?""  All my supplies were promptly binned and I haven't shaved since. Body hair is natural - in a way it's kind of intimate, isn't it? What's important is that she's comfortable with it and wants it for herself. My experiences are a bit on the extreme end of things, but in the end that's my takeaway about pressure to remove body hair. His problems with me and my body were only that - his problems.

If your partner says, 'I prefer a waxed genital area (and thus would prefer you to wax yours),' isn't there an implied ultimatum in there, that if you don't do it, he or she will be less attracted to you? I think it's by no means a neutral expression of preference."
FemmeThoughts,34azko,DustScoundrel,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:08:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on the person and how they do it. IMO, a request that is an implied, passive-aggressive ultimatum is still a demand, no matter how the hell they worded it.   But I absolutely think it's possible for partners to make requests in an appropriate fashion. Communicating a preference - with an understanding that that preference is only a preference and the only difference it will make to the relationship is that one thing will be slightly better for them - that's absolutely ok.  The problem is that most ""requests"" don't come in this fashion at all. And they tend to come from people who wouldn't be open to requests made of them."

Really not interested in the attraction thing.  In another portion of the quiz I might totally admit that I like seeing my male partner do things like build a deck or change a flat tire, and I would feel weird if he needed to do one of those things and he asked me to do it for him.   And that's really the part that perversely gives me hope. Sure these guys and I hypothetically value some less useful, more gendered traits in our partners. But we're excited and willing to raise little girls (and hopefully little boys!) to be stronger and more independent. We're cool with teaching them to cook AND use power tools and we're not worried that that will make them less attractive to other people's children when they grow up and embark on their own romances."

But women in countries that have gender-equalizing policies supported by an anti-individualist culture may not.""   -from this article.  All he is saying is that women in bad situations may have sex with a man who might possibly be able to get them out of the situation.  As if people of other genders would not do the same.  It's like he thinks he discovered some hidden truth that was previously unknown about.  Also he pretty much admits to taking advantage of women right there.    It's so ironic that guys openly do these horrible things just to get laid and be ""alpha"".  Imo wouldn't being a decent person, that people are attracted to, be much more ""alpha"" than living in an online forum bubble world?  If you have to resort to having sex with women in bad life situations, what does that say about you?  It says you're a pathetic human being - pretty much the opposite of what they think they are."
FemmeThoughts,33ldmk,radams713,21,Thu Apr 23 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"The cognitive dissonance! The bigotry!  I was just bowled over by it. This is a guy who is supposed to be one of the 'cultural leaders' of that movement. You'd think he would at least be able portray his views in a palatable way.  I was really impressed by Washko's  restraint. Most of the questions  were fairly straightforward and easy. He still managed to find a way to make himself look bad. 'Give em enough rope and he'll hang himself with it'  He couldn't even commit to softening his views. ""No means no"" [wink] anything less than outright fleeing is encouragement to keep trying ""I'm fine with gay people living their lives"" [wink] but I think they're unnatural degenerates trying to corrupt the youth  He seems to think that women are perfectly happy with the experience he presents, yet is totally unwilling to give them a voice. If it were so great, wouldn't that be the best possible advertising for his scheme? ""Look, women love it, here are some testimonials!"" What does it really say about him that he is unwilling to even give these women the option to decide for themselves whether or not to contribute?  His entire philosophy can be summed up with: ""Anything that gives me pleasure or power is good and right. Anything that threatens my pleasure or power is evil and unnatural"" He starts from there and hand-waves his way to somehow include ""Science!"" ""Nature!"" ""Psychology!"".  Conclusions completely detached from premises.  If he were to simply present himself as being amoral and selfish, then at least there would be some honesty. The real danger is that he is trying impart his warped philosophy with legitimacy. He and his acolytes may really believe that their views are objectively Good.  That any dissent is an assault on reality, on objective truth, on their very freedom.  Even knowing who he was talking to, who the audience would be, he didn't make the slightest attempt at showing any respect towards any particular women or women in general.  Can there be compromise with people like this? Is there really any benefit to meeting them halfway? He claims to have a wealth of life experience, but can't seem to demonstrate it beyond his time spent trawling the bars and clubs of eastern Europe looking for vulnerable women. His greatest fear seems to be that some day his sexual harassment could become illegal, OH HEAVENS NO.  I bet to anyone reading this, what I'm saying is anything but news. Reddit is infested with this type of person. They believe that all disagreement stems from the fact that ""they are logical, and you are emotional"". Over the past week or so I've probably had a dozen dust-ups over these issues, every single time their tactic is the same. Argue from a position of objective authority. When that doesn't work they shift to bullying. Well reasoned arguments have zero effect on them. It's difficult to be silent when I see such harmful ideas being pushed as 'truth'.  p.s. I'm not at all surprised that this guy is an awful lay. Admitting that was probably the only truly honest thing he said.  p.p.s. I had a good hard laugh at ""safe space for men in gaming"""
FemmeThoughts,33ldmk,Hamsworth,5,Fri Apr 24 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"""they are logical, and you are emotional""   This is totally the issue with a lot of arguments on Reddit -- the argument itself, or the deductions, might be ""logical"" but the premises are necessarily inherently emotional. There's no such thing as a perfectly logical premise in itself (outside of the realm of Descartes), yet so many people champion their argument as ""the logical one"". So frustrating."

FemmeThoughts,33ldmk,Elaine_Benes_,8,Thu Apr 23 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"Whoa, what a craaaazy experience to be part of (literally!) As an academic (in a currently woman-dominated field), it would be so strange to speak to someone who could not understand that you are an academic and an individual. I mean, I don't know if I could do it. I found it really interesting how so much of the interview was about her, and how he interpreted it to his followers. Just doesn't seem very alpha, you know? Also, if anyone seems to be living in an artificially created bubble, I would first say it's this Roosh V guy. An immigrant who stays in touch with his home country, but only in the forum he created and on his terms?"
FemmeThoughts,33ldmk,nightride,11,Thu Apr 23 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"TIL: Roosh read chomsky. Huh.  e: actually I want to expand on that. Sometimes he has the right information and then arrives at some completely, utterly whacked conclusion. Like I've had several moments of ""I don't necessarily disagree with that..?"" right before he arrives at the conclusion that women shouldn't be allowed to vote or something. It's interesting, that. I imagine that would make it very hard for him to change his opinion about anything."

FemmeThoughts,33ldmk,Hamsworth,2,Thu Apr 23 23:56:32 2015 UTC,"That and any kind of passive insult. For example, a guy sits down at the bar and says out loud ""so where are all the cute girls at?""  Some of the tactics would probably fit in just fine in ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"". A lot of it seems to be conceived and applied based on a very negative viewpoint of women. I certainly wouldn't trust anyone who calls themselves a pickup artist."

FemmeThoughts,33ldmk,oogmar,5,Sat Apr 25 21:28:01 2015 UTC,"First five minutes of the conversation, he gets her to self-neg and praise him twice. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised how good he is."
FemmeThoughts,33ldmk,votas,30,Thu Apr 23 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't had a chance to watch yet (only read some of it) so take this with a grain of salt, but in my mind there's a good chance she played along to keep him in a good mood and interested because he's obviously focused on his own feelings and playing along would make him keep talking and feel like he had the power he's so desperate for. Such science and logic."
FemmeThoughts,33ldmk,Elaine_Benes_,9,Thu Apr 23 17:10:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this was my thought too. She has much more to lose than he does--if he stops talking to her, she doesn't get as much material for the project."
FemmeThoughts,33ldmk,votas,13,Thu Apr 23 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's a common interview tactic. And from what she's said during the interview, she is clearly very aware and laughs at all the parts he'd like her to even while disagreeing yadda yadda."
FemmeThoughts,33ldmk,Elaine_Benes_,22,Thu Apr 23 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"Con artist techniques are all over the place. A couple months ago I was listening to an interview with Harris Wittels about Scientology (his girlfriend was into it and tried to get him to do Scientology rehab). The guy interviewing him told a story about how him and one of his friends went into a Scientology center in LA to just check it out as a joke. Before they went in they both vowed they would not get separated and would only be there for like half an hour. Within the first 20 minutes, somehow they are both separated from each other and brought to different parts of the complex by different groups of Scientology peeps, and they were stuck in there for hours before they could get out and find each other. Two grown men who had the intention of doing exactly the opposite. It's crazy how manipulation works."

FemmeThoughts,33fct8,MarthaGail,13,Wed Apr 22 01:49:29 2015 UTC,I really can't understand why people get so angry about who uses what bathrooms. Maintaining public safety is such bullshit. They're basically saying that a trans person being in a bathroom is dangerous.  The only time I care about someone in a public bathroom is if it's filled with people waiting and one of them stares through the space between the door and wall while I'm trying to pee. That moment of eye contact is so uncomfortable.

We also play Borderlands and Minecraft, which work beautifully for people with different game interests and skills.  The best thing is that with a long distance relationship (or as I affectionately call our ""too far for spontaneous visits, close enough for planned visits"" situation, a medium distance relationship) you can still do things simultaneously. And if you're not into gaming, you can still do things together-apart. Watch a show simultaneously and react to it in real time over a call. Read a book and discuss after each chapter. Just because there's distance doesn't mean you can't use technology to help make them seem a little closer."

FemmeThoughts,339c8l,Shmaesh,66,Mon Apr 20 18:06:47 2015 UTC,"It's something deeply ingrained which is the problem.

These are smart people, they have the ability to logic through this, they just outright refuse to."
FemmeThoughts,339c8l,Subclavian,60,Mon Apr 20 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"They are just as sexist as many of the religious institutions they claim to hate. The only difference is the religious institutions oppress women through God, whereas these white male atheists oppress women through the power of science!

FemmeThoughts,339c8l,Subclavian,40,Mon Apr 20 23:12:21 2015 UTC,It's also pretty amazing when people like Dawkins argue that they are turning simple logic onto religion--you can't take the same critical stance when looking at sexist behavior?
FemmeThoughts,339c8l,Elaine_Benes_,32,Mon Apr 20 20:36:24 2015 UTC,It forces them to be self reflective of themselves which for some people poses a problem.
FemmeThoughts,339c8l,Subclavian,11,Mon Apr 20 21:09:32 2015 UTC,Self reflection is literally oppression. /s
FemmeThoughts,339c8l,alizarincrimson7,13,Tue Apr 21 02:51:24 2015 UTC,"It boils downtown this at the heart.  They were able to get rid of god thinking. But they were never able to go one step further and get rid of the rest of the baggage that came with it.   If there are no gods, and there are no reasons to follow religious laws, and there are no reasons to feel trapped by ancient mythological stories as if they were facts, then that seems like it'd be about time to clean the entire house and not just the attic.  The next logical step seems like it'd be questioning everything that (some of us) were brought up into believing. If all religious stuff is bullshit, then topics like (for example) abortion become much simpler and much more important.   They want to rid the world of gods without challenging the harm caused by the specifically oppressive religious thinking. Like, great, you've figured out there are no magical beings as we know them. ...And?  I don't think its wrong to want to use logic and reason and science to examine life. But it's as if they've forgotten what those words mean and just use them as a cudgel for keeping the status quo. It's a sad day that someone can say to be ""I like to think about things logically"" and my first thought is ""oh great how racist is this asshat about to be...""  The more I looked into the mainstream atheist movement, the more I saw that if gods were simply added into the mix they'd be the same dudes using religion as the reason why it's super ok that women are treated like shit, because religion, instead of because ""reasons"".   It's an extra layer of frustrating. Here are these folks that wanna talk reason and logic, and they're almost the opposite of it.   Tldr -  Mainstream atheism wants ""Current Status Quo Minus Gods"". And I've got more important shit to do."
FemmeThoughts,339c8l,LovelyFugly,4,Tue Apr 21 13:30:50 2015 UTC,"I love the TL;DR.   The thing about logic that everyone neglects is that you have to carry it through. An example. Yesterday I was in a thread where people were demanding financial abortion be an option. Their logic was that the man didn't want it therefore he should just fuck off. They don't carry through their logic, they neglect to consider what the outcome of their policy demand would be because they don't care. If they carried through their logic, they would realize that financial abortion isn't a good solution at all, it's just a solution to a handful of people and causes more problems than it solves.   The Horsemen love to make generalizations. What happens if they carry that logic through? 'Women are humorless' says Harris, but if he stopped and thought, 'What is the actual outcome of women being humorless?' he'd realize that his statement is false because women are fucking funny and that would be impossible if women were humorless. TrollX and female comedians prove him so unbelievably wrong. Ever watch Wanda Sykes do stand up? She's fucking hysterical.   This is my biggest frustration with 'logical' people, they don't carry through."
FemmeThoughts,339c8l,Subclavian,12,Tue Apr 21 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is a deeply ingrained problem, but I don't think it is a matter of logic or rationality. Two people can share the same rational outlook, but if they have accepted different facts or interpretations of events, then they may arrive at different (possibly contradictory) but equally valid conclusions.  I think it is dangerous to try to claim that logic is on 'our' side, that all they need is a pinch of logic and clearly feminism results. People often pick something that is accepted in today's society as having authority and use that to claim legitimacy. We see similar thinking in anti-feminists who claim that they are the logical ones and that women are ""emotional"".  In the end reverence of reason (a normative acceptable kind of reason) itself is entrenched in our cultural history and a part of that same deeply ingrained problem."
FemmeThoughts,339c8l,see996able,7,Mon Apr 20 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"I see it as a matter of logic because we strive to undo generalizations while they depend on it. Generalizations are not things of science, if you depend on them like anti feminists do or like Dawkins does in this case, then you can not claim it to be logic because generalizations are just assumptions made. When you just use logic, there are few things you can make assumptions for and none of those exceptions include making assumptions for a whole group of people. The only assumptions that can be made are those that are consistently backed up with science without any deviation."
FemmeThoughts,339c8l,Subclavian,6,Tue Apr 21 14:17:02 2015 UTC,"They're old, white dudes. These are issues they never had to face,  think about or study. Dawkins knows a lot about biology, but he knows nothing about feminism or the like. It's not been very relevant for them in their life, plus it's hard to self reflect your own problematic behavior. So, all in all I just can sum it up with 'disappointed but not surprised'. But yeah, it's disappointing when even 'smart' people like those guys don't get it."

FemmeThoughts,339c8l,matsie,13,Tue Apr 21 01:12:33 2015 UTC,"Elevatorgate and reddit ruined the skeptic/atheist movement for me.    There definitely is a problem within the online skeptic community with sexism - I think there is this ingrained belief that it's impossible for people who understand critical thinking to have sexist biases. I'm subbed to /r/skeptic, and I've noticed this a lot recently with all the stuff that's been going on around The Food Babe. Yes, she is making unscientific, ridiculous claims, and she should be critiqued on that. But, there has also been a fair amount of sexism thrown her way, about her looks, as well as just straight-up sexist attacks/insults. This is being either disavowed, or dismissed (""it's not being sexist to say that someone who calls herself The Food Babe is a fraud! Besides, she was totally inviting that criticism when she chose that name!""). Anyone on /r/skeptic who even acknowledges that there is some sexism mixed in with all the (otherwise valid) criticism gets downvoted. It's problematic because anything which is overtly sexist misogynistic (such as when gendered slurs and threats are used) get no-true-Scotsmanned (""no true skeptic would say that kind of thing!"", despite the fact that there are regular users there who make these attacks, and get upvoted for them), whilst there is flat-out refusal to acknowledge the insidious, subtle sexism behind other criticisms. One skeptic actually wrote a really good blog post where he acknowledged the sexism that is often found in skeptical arguments, and even gave a perfect example of this kind of subtle sexism that he used to engage in - when he would write a blog post about Jenny McCarthy and her antivax movement, he would often include the fact that she used to be a playboy model. He stopped once he realised that this had nothing relevant whatsoever to offer to any criticism about her, as it came from a sexist bias - ""this woman's arguments are even more worthless because she used to get naked for money"". Unfortunately, this kind of subtle sexism crops up all the time, and when called out on it, most people in the community will try and explain it away (""it's not sexist - she used to be a playboy model, so it's just a fact, and besides, it's relevant because it shows that she doesn't have the prior relevant scientific training and knowledge to discuss immunology!""), rather than applying some critical thinking to it, and saying, ""yes, we make an awful lot of valid criticisms about this woman and her beliefs, but there is also some sexism at play here too"".  Ugh, sorry this turned into a bit of a rambling rant, it's just something that's been bothering me for a while."
FemmeThoughts,339c8l,Fairleee,6,Tue Apr 21 14:08:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the only reason Food Babe got any attention whatsoever (I mean, she's a food blogger who has been on the front page of reddit how many times now? NO ONE ELSE CARES ABOUT HER) for her dumb views is because she's an attractive woman. Like, LOOK A HOT WOMAN WHO WILL NEVER FUCK ME!

I'd rather talk to someone who believed in God for an hour but was interesting, cared about social justice, was funny, etc., than listen to someone like Sam Harris ramble on about atheism. And really, once you've established that you don't believe in God, what else is there to talk about? The problems of how to help people being oppressed by religious and sexist cultures are still there, and coming into that conversation with the attitude of ""hurr durr believers are illogical and primitive"" is not going to help.

Because he really truly thinks about it and doesn't just adhere to any kind of dogma. He supports social justice and lgbtq people and feminism and all that good stuff. And he's great at refuting shitty religious arguments about those things. His mother is an ordained minister so he's definitely not gonna stand for sexist bs.

They try to claim to not be a movement, yet they all seem to fall back to the same arguments, line of thinking, worship of logic, etc. This is made even worse by the anti-philosophical tendencies that tend to accompany them, what with people like AronRa claiming that philosophy is useless and that science is truth (a philosophical statement, but whatever). If someone claims to not partake in philosophy, I don't see how then really can be interesting in conversation since their views will always be shallow and restricted to whatever narrow bubble they consider to be outside of philosophical inquiry.   tl;dr ""atheism"" seems to equal ""fedora"" these days   Atheists have always had to deal with negative stereotypes, but I think this point in history is the first time they have been responsible for creating their own negative public persona."

Women bear a much heavier burden then men and it's not as easy as the go to ""suit and tie"" men have the availability to wear.  The whole traditionalist expectation of dress code and the subsequent stratification of it. Casual, smart-casual, business-casual, formal, and so on, is such a load of elitist crap."

Maybe it's overboard, but I've always thought it was safer to wear a suit to important interviews for a more professional look and to put your best foot forward. I wouldn't cry foul unless  they didn't reject male candidates for wearing business casual attire as well.  Also, the article mentioned that she was late to the interview. She downplays the importance of this, because she let them know, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was the more significant reason. Although she let them know that she was going to be late because she got lost, the company isn't obliged to accept her excuse, particularly if no other candidate was late as well.   If a person values an interview highly enough, they will do whatever they can within their power to not be late. I get lost all of the time, so for important things like this, I drive to the location the day before to practice and leave at least an hour early, sometimes 2 if I'm worried. It's better to be early and wait in your car, than be late.   I do wish her the best of luck though."

If your particular company files documents through the Securities Exchange Commission or some similar agency, those records are open and they might hold some pay check agreements you could look up.  You could also go through Public Records and look at their unemployment tax returns; they have detailed data on every employee and what they were paid; it's just a matter of having the time and patience to go through it all.  If you're being discriminated in any way, you could go through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, file a complaint with them and have them do an investigation.

FemmeThoughts,32mzmw,Tartra,17,Wed Apr 15 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"I highly, highly assure you this discussed with Drake - and Britney Spears, and Nicki Minaj before him.  This is still a business. These people work together. Madonna's brand is sex. If she's working with someone, that other artist comes in knowing that they're there to support each other's brand - and Madonna, who benefits greatly from these collaborations, is not going to be the 'psycho face-hugging woman who preys on collab artists', because then no one will want to work with her and the guest's artist's fans wils be encouraged to tear Madonna down (Drake: Screw Madonna, that was completely inappropriate, I hated that kiss, she tasted like an ashtray).   This is all carefully planned by many people, and with fantastic results (look how many people are talking about this!). No one is more aware of how the public views Madonna than her PR people. They know they can't count on calling her the most desirable woman anymore. They can, however, call her controversial by continuing to jabbing at the famous opinion that ""She's been doing this too long. She's not even hot now.""  So how do they jab at a desensitized public opinion and make people care? Defy them! Someone in her brand marketing asked for some young, famous guy to collaborate with her. Both artists have to benefit (or else why arrange it? Again, it's a business), and while I can't speak for Drake's beyond residual controversy (""Drake didn't want this!"") and working alongside such a star, Madonna is there to flaunt sex.  In the same way Janet Jackson wasn't shocked when Justin ripped her costume, or when Madonna kissed Britney, I can't stress this enough, both parties knew. This was well planned! Madonna is the fierce sex fiend who takes what she wants, leaving poor Drake flabbergasted because that whippersnapper never expected the whirlwind of passion. Get it ?  :D  Watch how little prep this needs once the marketing guys have the plan:  Marketing Guys: Okay, Madonna, we've got Drake to go on concert with you.  Madonna: Okay.

FemmeThoughts,32mzmw,lavenderblue,26,Wed Apr 15 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"It wasn't gross because of her age (although the media is typically picking up on the wrong thing and being assholes about it).  It was gross becausehe clearly did not want an extended french kiss in front of the whole world, and even tried to stop her at one point, while she pushed him back down.  It wsa icky and awful, and plays into the cultural narrative that guys should like it whenever it happens."
FemmeThoughts,32mzmw,probabIy_drunk,18,Wed Apr 15 12:29:29 2015 UTC,"Yo, y'all, the article is actually really interesting because a lot of the public shaming she's getting isn't due to the fact that the kiss wasn't consensual. Most of the public shaming is about her age (e.g., about the fact that she's twice Drake's age, and that she drains the life force of younger people). I'd be totally okay with the public shaming if it was about her total disregard for consent! But the public shaming is about her age. If a younger woman had done this, the public would either be cheering it on (because ""dudes can't be sexually harassed"") or the public would chastise the non-consensual aspect (thus implying that being a visibly aging woman is somehow worse than being one who cares not a whit for consent.)"

Just watch the video clip midway down on this page where Madonna laughs after learning that Sharon Gault, her makeup artist, was drugged and raped.  Does Madonna offer any support?  Does she console Sharon?  Does she urge Sharon to contact the police?  No.  Instead, she laughs and states, ""I don't believe that you don't remember things like that.  How can Sharon not know what happened to her?  . . .  All I can think of is that she started talking about how she's on tour with me, she's staying at the Ritz Carlton and those guys got it in their mind they were going to fuck with her.""

I don't know why everyone is having difficulty separating the issues. Since when are we not able to talk about more than one aspect of an event?  On the one hand, sure, no one wants to be kissed like that when they haven't given consent. But the article is about something else entirely, about society's larger perception of this and the other comments and remarks being made about her solely because she is an ageing woman who is refusing to follow expectations.   Would it still have been repulsive if a 56-year old male pop star forcibly made out with a younger female pop star half his age? Yes, of course. But would the general public and media respond with the same extent of vitriol and disgust towards the man? Certainly not. And that is something we should be thinking and talking about.

FemmeThoughts,32laxd,so_srs,23,Tue Apr 14 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"I'm way more annoyed with the media dropping ""Rodham"" than the popular media going calling her ""Hillary"". For many years when she first came to the scene, she did insist (and got) the media to refer to her as ""Rodham Clinton"", and that was dropped, iirc, soon after she was forced to show support as a wife. For another thing, her campaign is branding her as Hillary and I think that should supercede a media pundit's preference. And for the most part I don't think ""legitimate newspapers"" are as guilty of the familiarity. Also, ""Clinton"" isn't the name she was born with, unlike the Bushes, and I might have been too young to recall correctly, but Bush Sr was never as super popular in the public consciousness as President Clinton, so there's a difference."

FemmeThoughts,32laxd,Quouar,62,Tue Apr 14 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"I do agree that it's an interesting article, and I definitely think it raises some interesting points, but there's a lot there to disagree with. First and foremost, I think it's extremely important to point out that Hillary Clinton is a skilled politician. She knows how to play this game, and is very good at it. There's no way she would let her campaign brand her as ""Hillary"" rather than ""Ms. Clinton"" if she didn't think it was a political benefit to her. There's political savvy underlying it.  More generally, though, I do think there are relevant differences between the Bushes and the Clintons, and I also think there's an evolution into incorporating first names into politics more generally. The article points out that we don't refer to people as ""Marco"" or ""Rand,"" but they are referred to by their full names - Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, etc. Clinton being referred to by her first name is something I see as being in this trend, albeit a bigger extension of it.   Beyond that, though, I also think that Clinton has a motivation for not just being Clinton. Bill wasn't always the most popular guy, and I can see her choosing to go with ""Hillary"" as a way to distance herself from him. It's also why I expect he won't play as big a role on the campaign trail as other candidates' spouses will. She wants to run on her own terms and be seen on her own terms, not as someone associated with him.  But most of all, I'd consider that there is a difference between how men and women run for office and are treated once they get there. It's something that's real, and that she's undoubtedly taking advantage of. Think about Palin and how much of a deal was made about her family and her role as a mother. Think about Mitt Romney's wife and how much family played into her speeches about her husband. Hell, think about Michelle Obama, and how she's seen exclusively as ""Mrs. Obama"" rather than as a skilled and intelligent person in her own right. American politics relies on being able to imagine being ""buddies"" with the politician in question, and with a woman, that means picturing her as maternal. When a lot of people think of Hillary Clinton, ""maternal"" is probably not the first thing that springs to mind. She's not terribly feminine in the traditional sense, and she knows that. By going with her first name, she's softening her image, trying to seem less intimidating and thus more accessible to voters. It's playing into expectations, which, bad though they might be, is what politics necessitates."

FemmeThoughts,32laxd,Demon_Nietzsche,7,Wed Apr 15 01:00:55 2015 UTC,"I guess that is fair. I just remember reading/learning about presidential popularity. Most presidents become more popular after they've been in office, and this is especially true of Bill.   Bill seems to be particularly liked because he isn't necessarily seen as a hard partisan. He is seen as someone who was willing to compromise in ways that more recent politicians have not been. He (and Hillary) are also quite close to the centre of the American political spectrum, which makes them very well liked by the swing vote. I view (and I think most people view) Hillary as very similar to Bill (in terms of policy), which is part of the reason she has such widespread appeal.   While these aren't reasons I would condone either of the Clinton's, I believe that these are reasons why Hillary (much like Bill) will succeed and win both the nomination and become POTUS."

When we searched the literature, we could not find one empirical study of sexism in faculty hiring using actual faculty members as evaluators and focusing on fields in which women are most underrepresented.   They've narrowed sexism in hiring in STEM fields to sexism in hiring in STEM academia for tenure track positions.   So, for example, a study like this one, where science faculty members showed significant bias in favour of men when hiring for a laboratory management position, aren't considered.   Study where science faculty rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the identical female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. Female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. -link   Personally, I don't find these results that surprising. As the article correctly notes, most university STEM departments have huge gender imbalances, and so yes, universities are actively looking to adjust that a little. However, they're also only looking at one candidate. Most often departments looking to fix their image choose one or two people they think will do well on the tenure track, and use them as shields anytime someone complains about sexism or racism."

FemmeThoughts,32j2io,dedededede,2,Tue Apr 14 22:27:43 2015 UTC,"I don't actually. My saying that comes from listening to a lot of academics talk shop and politics. I've seen both halves of the conversation though. Minority and women academics being told to apply to departments looking to fix their image, or being warned not to bother with school X because they just hired ""one of you"".   And I've heard roomfuls of (mostly) white men talk about how many of X they need. Spouses that fit the bill are always something they look for, because the person has a strong reason to come (their spouse's offer) and so they can get away with offering something non-tenure (they'll offer an adjunct position if they can get away with it). They also really look for ""double minorities"", because they can check two boxes for the price of one.  I've also listened to those hires complain about being used as a public face - expected to sit on boards and panels having to do with discrimination. One of the difficulties of being tenure track is that you have a bunch of markers to hit in terms of your personal career (publish or perish), but also can't piss off your department. So repeatedly turning down various administrative and appearance jobs can piss your chair and colleagues off, but taking those jobs seriously eats into your time. The goal is to minimise time expenditure while maximising prestige and good will.  So you may get a tenure track offer, but if you're a woman or minority (or wise, both), there may be different expectations of you.  I knew one black female academic who started avoiding her office so that people couldn't ask more favours. And so she didn't get a reputation of never being around, she posted elaborate and busy schedules to her door, showing that her time was totally taken up.  She had a full teaching schedule, research to complete and she was constantly being forced into figurehead stuff. And it seriously impacted her career. When she said yes, she couldn't also get enough else done, so her tenure was delayed. When she said no, her colleagues tried to drag out the process without actually denying her tenure (which they really didn't have a good case for). And everyone knew what they were doing. It was so bad that it didn't stay confined to department gossip, eventually faculty in other fields, in her field at other universities, most of the department graduate students and some of the undergrads were aware. It was pretty awful."

I was still in school and complaining to my dad about this really strict teacher we had, and I complained that she was way harsher than the other male teachers, who were way more inclined to relax and joke around at times. He then said to me ""But would the class still behave if she joked around like the male teachers did?"" And the more I thought about it, I realised she had to be that way otherwise no one would take her seriously. All the other female teachers who weren't as strict had to put up with way more shit from the class, and had loads more misbehaviour, whereas the male teachers could joke around and relax, and if someone stepped out of line they'd get serious for a while to deal with the situation, and go back to being more jokey. I realise that a lot of this is down to women being less physically formidable, but I also think it has to do with people being more likely to focus on the way a woman looks than what's coming out of their mouth. I feel like, as a society (and I'll admit I'm prone to this on occaison too, but trying to stop) we're programmed to notice the way a woman looks straight away over anything else, and its perfectly normal to make negative comments too. Whereas with men, we're more likely to take them seriously and less likely to comment on how they're dressed, or how they've done their hair, or whether or not they're fat etc."

Change can only come from within, and women should be able to choose- but from what she writes, my biggest problem would be that it seems that, while the women are technically choosing, there are immense social pressures to do so.  She even says that to not have it done is considered disgusting, and means the woman cannot properly join her husband's family.  This, for me, complicates the issue of choice.  Is it really a ""choice"" to do anything if you're punished if you choose one option?  ""The sort of feminist argument about this is that it’s about the control of women but also of their sexuality and sexual pleasure. But when you talk to people on the ground, you also hear people talking about the idea that it’s women’s business. As in, it’s for women to decide this.""  This is the relevant passage.  Here, she means ""women"" as a group, not individual women, and I guess it's more important that individuals have a choice than women as a whole decide.  In my mindset, if there were fewer barriers for individual women choosing no, it would make me less uncomfortable, but the social consequences are huge.  The ""benefits"" seem to mostly just be escape from social punishments- ie, not prevented from marriage, not the source for disgust because of androgynous genitalia, etc.  But this does come from a western, individual-obsessed mindset."
FemmeThoughts,31wlz8,fraulien_buzz_kill,8,Wed Apr 8 23:18:36 2015 UTC,"The title says women choose, but it's a Hobson's choice, i.e. they don't really have one - the consequences of choosing not to are too severe."
FemmeThoughts,31wlz8,katrionatronica,6,Thu Apr 9 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"I think this is really it in a nutshell.  It sounds trivializing, but bear with me. What this anthropologist is saying, at root, is that getting circumcised for these women is basically the same level of social pressure women in the U.S. feel to shave (compulsory, failure comes with significant social repercussions) and change our names when we get married (de facto compulsory, still. No threat of violence, usually).  And I don't mean that either is the equivalent of losing parts of your body, but that societally, they're 'choices' in which women face basically the same amount of coercive pressure. Rendering the 'choice' part largely moot."

FemmeThoughts,31wlz8,dedededede,17,Thu Apr 9 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"To me the article feels drenched in ""white explorer sensationalism"". There are so many feminist African women in all parts of the continent who fight against practices like FGM for a long time now. I don't think Western anthropologists can change FGM traditions by carefully figuring out who is really in charge and then inject the right information like a medicine - as if they are studying a foreign primitive species that cannot speak.   We need to be targeting people who are in the extended family, and we know that we need to figure out who are the figures of authority in these families, and who are the influences on them in the community. We need to do male elders, but also female elders.   I can only hope that their efforts are accompanied by a serious dialogue with local feminists who fight FGM.  BTW A great recent French/German documentary about the Egyptian feminist Nawal El Saadawi  Nawal El Saadawi - La voix libre de l‘Egypte  Nawal El Saadawi - Die Löwin vom Nil  (not accessible [at least the online version], available until 06/25/2015 at least in France and Germany)."

FemmeThoughts,31jd4n,xaynie,11,Mon Apr 6 09:49:21 2015 UTC,"It's more than that. It's the equivalent of the Middle Ages witch test (""The Swimming Test""): Accused witches were dragged to the nearest body of water, stripped to their undergarments, bound and then tossed in to to see if they would sink or float. Since witches were believed to have spurned the sacrament of baptism, it was thought that the water would reject their body and prevent them from submerging. According to this logic, an innocent person would sink like a stone, but a witch would simply bob on the surface.  The lung float test uses the same logic. They remove the lungs from the fetus/stillborn. If the lungs float, the ""baby"" breathed and thus it was murder, and if they sink then it never breathed therefore not murder. But many many tests since have discredited it, showing that air could still get into the lungs, regardless of whether or not the fetus/baby breathed."

My boyfriend would usually pick me up, and then we would go watch movies or whatever. I could not get it through his head that it was an actual matter of safety. One time he decided at the last minute that he would rather stay home and work on fixing his computer, knowing full well that I didn't have time to arrange a ride from anyone else. When I got upset, after arguing for a bit (""what are you going to do, never walk outside alone after dark?"" well... yeah, that's the plan??), he actually said ""you're a big girl, you can manage a ten minute walk on your own."" Oh my god, was I angry. I was so angry. I'm getting a little angry just thinking about it right now actually.  Anyway, he stopped whining about it after the very first person he talked to about it besides me, told him to shut the fuck up and listen to me, because she herself was assaulted walking to the dorms at night. I'm glad he takes it seriously now but I'm still really upset that it took someone else getting assaulted for him to believe me.  Thanks for this thread, it's helped me realize that I'm actually still pretty upset at him for this, and that it needs to be discussed.

It was nice to get out of the many normal sitcom tropes.  The complexity of each clone character is amazing as well.  Women are not unideminsional.  This show has been a breath of fresh air.  Now if season 3 would just hurry up and come to Amazon Instant.    :D  Thanks for sharing.  I love Tatiana Maslany!

There were pretty much no season 3 details besides basics that are a given: characters and actors that we know for certain will appear, at least for some time.   It's a fairly remarkable article actually. It's part an analysis of the show, part an analysis of sexism and the way that women's bodies are owned, part an analysis of Maslany (both by the interviewer and herself) as well as some self reflection on the part of the interviewer. Lili Loofbourow, the author, manages to wind all these threads together. I thought it was pretty smashing."

FemmeThoughts,312ozc,vagued,76,Wed Apr 1 16:30:59 2015 UTC,"No one should feel like their body isn’t “good enough.”   I've been on both ends of the spectrum, I was obese and I was near anorexic at two stages in my life and I got shamed tremendously for either. It was never the overweight or obese who shamed me for being too skinny, and it was never the skinny who shamed me for being obese, it was always that demographic in the middle that's in that nebulous zone where they're out of shape, yet not overweight, who feel they have a privilege to tell you ""damn, you should eat something!"" or ""you sure you want to order that?""  And the way that they hide it behind ""I just want you to be healthy"", is absolute horseshit. People are born with a distinct disadvantage: lack of knowledge, and saying that it's all about personal responsability and choice is somewhat absurd when the ""choices"" out there are essentially skewed economically, nutritionally and culinarily against us (junk foods are cheaper, have favourable taste, use additives to create addiction, etc). And the jobs we have are sedentary, with a market system of distribution that caters and perpetuates immobility, delivery and catering of our food."
FemmeThoughts,312ozc,Adahn5,37,Wed Apr 1 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"Also, except for extremes on the spectrum, you can't look at someone's body and tell whether or not they're healthy. And you can't determine whether their health is caused by things they can easily change.   My weight has gone up and down a lot, and pretty much never in relation to how healthy I was eating. It's pretty much only been affected by meds and illness. I've been super thin, and very overweight.  Here are a few anecdotes, that show just how much no one actually gives a shit about your ""health"", and just how much overweight people are discriminated against:  I once gained twenty pounds when I was on an incredibly healthy, dietician approved diet. Chicken kebobs, israeli salad. Delicious, and healthy, good proportions. I was going yoga 4 times a week, physical therapy 3 times a week and I worked out every day. All of this was doctor approved and recommended. But the medication was really fucking with my metabolism, and I packed on the pounds.  I once lost 40 lbs. It was good weight loss, I was overweight, and I was losing fat. And while I was dropping pounds quickly, it was within normal and healthy ranges. The first 15lbs I lost happened over the winter holidays. It was a very busy set of hols for me, because I was basically going to a holiday part or a birthday party at least once I day. And I went straight for the most indulgent, extravagant desserts. It was really unhealthy. Like, ridiculously unhealthy. Yeah, I got back to my standard diet after that, but that was also the same diet I'd been on for a year before during which my weight hadn't changed at all. While eating healthy is important, it has minimal effect on my weight. Which is unbelievably frustrating. Especially when everyone in the world thinks they can look at me and know about my dietary habits and health.  When I was on the super healthy diet and working out, but overweight and gaining weight, everyone treated me horribly. They questioned what I ate, or congratulated me for doing the right thing, or came up to me to tell me how concerned they were about my health. This was true even of people who knew that I was ill, and knew that I ate ridiculously healthily and exercised regularly. My body size spoke more loudly than facts did.  When I was thin, and people thought I was healthy, no one gave a second look at the junk I put in my mouth. Not once. They just assumed I was healthy. And if I had a complaint and needed to see a doctor, I was taken seriously.  Doctors are terrible about discriminating based on patients' body size.  I've had doctors refuse to take medical concerns seriously because of my weight. I've also had doctors use my weight as an excuse, and tell me that X will go away when I lose the weight. Even for things where X is totally and completely unrelated to weight. Doctors always assume that my weight is causing the problem. Always! Even doctors who had me come in as a thin-bodied patient with these complaints and then saw me gain the weight because of medication side-effects would still tell me that the weight gain was causing the problem. Even though they themselves had seen me complaining of the problem before I was overweight!  A couple years ago I had a very, very bad case of c. diff. I had to be hospitalised and was on IVs during the worst part. In the hospital I lost 10 lbs. I continued dropping weight when I went home, because I was discharged still very ill. I lost over 60lbs in total. This was very unhealthy weight loss. I mostly loss muscle, stuff I would need to eventually gain back. It was also happening dangerously fast. When I went back in to see my doctor, days after being discharged, still ridiculously ill, and still losing weight at a very dangerous weight, he complimented me and said at least I was losing some weight. He wouldn't take my concerns about my weight loss seriously either. I found out later that proper procedure would have been to rehospitalise me immediately because my weight loss was so far off the scales and because I was dangerously dehydrated. I ended up bedbound for six months, something I likely wouldn't have been had my doctor taken my symptoms seriously instead of being focused on the fact that I was closer to a body size that society approves of.  Oh also, eating healthily is ridiculously expensive. I just had a doctors appointment the other day where I had to go over my diet. Only I can't cut out added sugars because I can't control what my local food pantry gives me. And when I have to choose between two foods, one with added sugars and preservatives and one without, I choose the one with. I know it's unhealthy, but it's also cheaper, and I don't have the money to spare. And because it has preservatives, it lasts longer. The doctor I had yesterday was great and understood this. But the vast majority of my doctors just don't. No matter how many times I explain it, they think I'm lying or it's an excuse. And so they always ask me if I'd be willing to try or try harder. As though I'm not already doing the very best that I can. As though if I just tried, I'd have more money. Or they shake their heads and tsk, and write notes in my file about how I'm uncooperative and am refusing to follow doctor's instructions.   EDIT: Thanks for all the great responses. If you liked this comment, then please take a few minutes to read this comment I made later down in the comments section. I wanted to expand on a couple of the other aspects that no one ever really talks about."

I'm trying to pick up some freelance work, but it's difficult as I never had the opportunity to go to college, and for personal reasons, have zero references.   Lack of work is why I'm on food stamps and going to food pantries and how I have experience with that half of the equation.  I do enjoy writing though, and I'm glad you appreciated it.

So much truth in what you wrote, I have very little to add except to say yes - there are a lot of medical professionals who (and I don't know if it's because of disgust, ignorance, or what have you) but are consistently discarding the weight problem as a failure of their patience, rather than society.  There are deeper roots to this and they're material, economical, environmental and most of all systemic to consider and address."

FemmeThoughts,312ozc,chelbski-willis,16,Wed Apr 1 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"My pleasure vagued ^^  Yeah it's very strange, antisocial behaviour that we engage in, the shaming. But the body fat/skinny shaming in particular is very tied (I feel) to our excuses for our own body shape. For instance when I was overweight and going on obese, I'd look at morbidly obese people at the mall, for instance, and I'd think to myself ""wow, I'm a little overweight but I'm not like those blimps over there. Holy hell.""  It was my way of rationalising away the cognitive dissonance for my own discomfort, dislike for my own body. It took me losing the weight, getting shamed for losing it, and then subsequently getting to a better place—which was more of a journey in maturity than physical change, that made me realise that the shaming is a disgusting practice that said more about ourselves than it does for the people shamed."
FemmeThoughts,312ozc,kochipoik,35,Wed Apr 1 18:06:10 2015 UTC,"As a side not about that Megan Trainor song, another line that's really off-putting to me is ""My mama she told me don't worry about your size, because boys like a little more booty to hold at night.""  Like, thanks mom. You couldn't have gone with ""because you're a multifaceted person and qualities like intelligence, humor, kindness, drive, empathy, and ambition are what you should value most."" But, you know. Make it rhyme."

I listened to a couple of her newer singles and it's pretty clear that she is much more of a traditionalist than a feminist; I don't know what she considers herself, but it's really blatant.  She's entitled to express her opinions, but it will definitely keep me from being as big of a fan as I might have been."

After every fight, Just apologize, And maybe then I’ll let you try and rock my body right, Even if I was wrong, You know I’m never wrong, Why disagree?”   Ugh"
FemmeThoughts,312ozc,Adahn5,6,Thu Apr 2 02:19:40 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, if it is supposed to be satire, it's some Daily Currant level unfunny, misleading, confusing satire.

FemmeThoughts,30wtxj,tiguto,6,Tue Mar 31 10:28:07 2015 UTC,"I think this is relevant- I listen to a wide range of music and rather like Joan Jett and Pat Benatar, and I have multiple times been told while rocking out to them that it's girl music. What? A lot of the music isn't from a feminine perspective, and if it is, who cares? Is AC-DC singing ""lock up your daughters, lock up your wives"" only for guys? Why shouldn't guys be interested in hearing from a female perspective or women singing at all?    Those were particularly conservative and traditional guys, and most of my friends would never say anything like that, but I think it's a valuable insight. On a related note, I recognize that I totally have the exact same problem with comedy. Listening to a woman comedian talk about woman problems makes me groan and think not again. But Louis CK can talk about how inconvenient it is to have a dick all night and I think it's hilarious and even though I understand that women have just as much right to groan and be frustrated, part me thinks, ""Eh, big deal.""

If society is convincing women that they shouldn't want to do certain things, and those things are all awesome and men are encouraged to do them...that's really fucked up and not okay.    Even if it's a choice, it's a choice that has been extremely strongly influenced by society and tradition and propaganda and a ton of other stuff.    If women are 'choosing' to not have awesome jobs, we should examine why, and why men 'choose' to have those jobs all the time.  Choices are externally influenced all the time.

Okay, that's fine, let's do both please.  I don't see what you are trying to say.  Both of those would be wonderful things.    Most musicians who get paid do it for fun, alongside another job.  It takes a lot of luck and skill to be able to do it professionally, as a sole source of income.  But to get there, everyone needs to start small first.  And having more women doing that would result in more 'big' female musicians being able to make it.  Like you said - you can't increase the proportion of successful musicians that are women without also increasing the proportion of regular, underpaid musicians that are women.  So let's increase the proportion of regular, underpaid musicians who are women."

I started with Dark Places and I loved it (also the movie should be released sometime this year so it would be a good time to read). I also loved Sharp Objects.

FemmeThoughts,30kyux,Adahn5,24,Sat Mar 28 07:51:08 2015 UTC,"Transcript:  I had to learn how to be a feminist, so throughout highschool and college I was involved with clubs, organising against wars in the middle-east, raising awareness about climate change, and demanding gay and lesbian rights. So I was heavily involved in social justice causes but I still didn't call myself a feminist. At the time I may have even uttered the dreaded phrase “I believe in equality but I'm not a feminist.” Yeah not a high-point in my life.  So like most people who grew up immersed in the neo-liberal ideology of the west I saw the world largely as a series of individuals making their own personal individual choices. And here I was, a young woman making my own personal choices about what to wear, what to buy, what to study and what I wanted to do every day. Within that narrow, individualistic framework feminism seemed like a relic of the distant past. Back then I thought sexism basically boiled down to a few bad apples with misguided personal beliefs born out of ignorance or overt hatred.  So it wasn't until I was in my early-to-mid twenties that I began to realise that my impression of feminism had been completely wrong. With the help of some amazing mentors and by reading a lot of feminist writing, especially the works of women of colour and queer women from around the world I learned to see through a sociological lens and understand the world as it really exists: as a series of intersecting social systems. Once you have a systemic and institutional framework you see how oppression manifests in many subtle ways under the system of what Bell Hooks calls “White Supremacist, Capitalist, Patriarchy.”  So not only did I have to learn how to be a feminist, I also had to learn how to be a feminist who understands systems. I had to learn how systems of oppression are maintained by our participation in them; but they're also self-perpetuating via paths of least resistance and as such are larger than any one person's choices.  Okay so this is the part where I say things that may ruffle some feathers—but I think it's a critical discussion to have. So over the past few years I've become increasingly worried about the direction mainstream internet feminism appears to be headed, at least in the West. Unfortunately many contemporary discourses in and around feminism tend to emphasise a form of hyper-individualism which is informed by that neo-liberal world view. More and more I hear variations on this idea that anything that any woman personally chooses to do is a feminist act.  This attitude is often referred to as “Choice Feminism.” Choice Feminism posits that each woman determines what is empowering for herself—which might sound good on the surface but this concept risks obscuring the bigger picture and larger fundamental goals of the movement by focusing on individual women with a very narrow individual notion of empowerment. It erases the reality that some choices that women make have an enormous negative impact on other women's lives.  So it's not enough to feel personally empowered or be personally successful within the oppressive framework of the current system even if an individual woman can make Patriarchy work for her, it's still a losing game for the rest of the women on the planet. The fact of the matter is that some choices have ramifications beyond beyond ourselves and reinforce harmful Patriarchal ideas of women as a group, about women's bodies and our wider, shared culture.  And because of how systems of oppression intersect and compound one another, it's women of colour, indigenous women, women living in the global South,  women with disabilities, queer women and trans women, who bear the brunt of these ramifications. Choice Feminism also obscures the fact that women don't have a real choice. We have a very narrow set of predetermined choices within Patriarchy. Women can choose from a pre-approved palate but we cannot meaningfully choose liberation.  We cannot choose a way out of our constraints, at least not without ending these oppressive systems that limit our options. So when we talk about free choice in today's world we're really talking about a very narrow spectrum of choices that are amenable to Patriarchy. So when we talk about how to be a feminist for me, that means being committed to something much larger than ourselves. It's understanding what role you play within our collective movements for liberation.  It's re-examining our desires and interests and understanding how those are often shaped by Capitalism, Patriarchy and White-Supremacy. It's understanding our own intersections of privilege and oppression and how that will fundamentally change our behaviours and attitudes and values. It's realising that being a Feminist is a lifelong learning endeavour and that we will make some mistakes on the way and we should be compassionate to ourselves when that happens.  It's realising that others will make mistakes and we should extend that compassion to them as well. Feminism is not about striving for perfection it's about striving for justice. We are all connected, we are all bound together under the oppression of Patriarchy and as such our personal actions and inactions do have a harmful effect on other women, especially those of the most marginalised communities. I realise this isn't a popular thing to say but “feel good personal empowerment” is not how to be a feminist. In order to be a feminist we have a responsibility beyond ourselves, we have a responsibility to each other, and we have a responsibility to work for the collective liberation of all women."

The fact of the matter is that some choices have ramifications beyond beyond ourselves and reinforce harmful Patriarchal ideas of women as a group, about women's bodies and our wider, shared culture.   The trouble I have with this is as a position is that it's semi-meaningless without discussion of which choices you mean. Even the most ardent choice feminist - okay, maybe not the most ardent, but you know what I mean - will have some issue where they agree that a woman's choice is contributing to the oppression of other women, such as your Phyllis Schlaflys campaigning against women's rights. And on the other hand, I've seen women who hold that feminists have an obligation not to wear ""feminine"" clothing or makeup in order to make that less of a standard in society, regardless of what they personally like wearing (sometimes because they consider liking it to be simply socialization women need to break themselves out of), which is tremendously alienating to some. So I'm interested in what exactly she's talking about in terms of these choices."
FemmeThoughts,30kyux,chocolatepot,11,Sat Mar 28 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"I thought that particular comment was more aimed at the co-opting Feminists among the ranks of Capitalist, Imperialist women on the caliber of Hillary Clinton, Madeline Albright and the various women CEOs who do not seek emancipation, empowerment or liberation in order to free themselves of Patriarchy, but rather in order to make it work for them, and then use the systems in place to oppress other women.   I'm interested in what exactly she's talking about in terms of these choices.   I would have liked more specific examples too. But seeing as she cited Bell Hooks, who's a socialist, and repeatedly brought about the idea of a White Supremacist, Capitalist Patriarchy, I feel it's more likely what she was aiming for. That's only my interpretation of it, of course."

FemmeThoughts,30kyux,chocolatepot,7,Sun Mar 29 13:56:57 2015 UTC,"There is no knowing what precise choices Sarkeesian was talking about, but I can add my own two cents about choice feminism for what it's worth: I guess my beef is the politicisation of choices that are essentially meaningless, and that's when it's good - at its worst it's trying to spin consumerism into feminism. If you want to shave your legs and wear makeup that's, well, whatever, but these are just choices - not feminist statements, and no amount of polish and rationalisation will make it so. It's fluff, really, designed to make you feel good even though you have chosen to accept and embrace that you're being sold something you don't need and will suck up your time and your money. And the fact that you're just going along with the system, both by financially supporting an industry that at the same time sells you a pretty narrow idea of what is beautiful and tell you that being beautiful is essential to being a woman, and by ""looking the part"".  I don't care if women shave their legs and wear makeup, I shave my legs and wear makeup, but I think you at least have to own up to that hypocrisy, and know that you have chosen the path of least resistance. If you even actively chose it in the first place. This rant is brought to you by: all those ""they say feminists are ugly let's show them"" filled with conventionally attractive women on tumblr. I can't believe anybody believes that's even slightly helpful."
FemmeThoughts,30kyux,hermithome,5,Sat Mar 28 18:15:31 2015 UTC,"you're just going along with the system  the path of least resistance   I'm not into claiming that my makeup is a feminist act, but this is the kind of thing I was describing as off-putting. I actually only started wearing makeup recently, because I was previously working in a somewhat messy job where I was unhappy and didn't want to be. (My coworkers did wear makeup - it wasn't a situation where makeup would be out of place.) Getting a new - non-messy, though sometimes dusty - job that I wanted has allowed me to feel like I could express my personal style with skirts and dresses and have fun with cosmetics. I'm pretty minimalist, five or so minutes' work in the morning and the cheapest brands - compared to the amount of money I spend on fabric and ethical food, it's pennies - but it's still more makeup than my coworkers wear, or that my coworkers have worn in other jobs I've worked in this field. It's probably an overreaction, but sometimes I worry that it's actually detrimental for me to be overtly dressy because it's not Serious.  Obviously, my conception of ""fun"" and of my personal style is influenced by socialization, and the fact that my (majority women) field and my family have been basically makeup-free does not delete the messages I get from the wider world. But in my life, it doesn't appear to be the path of least resistance. I never regularly wore makeup beyond concealer before, and I'm having a good time playing Art Class on my face.   This rant is brought to you by: all those ""they say feminists are ugly let's show them"" filled with conventionally attractive women on tumblr.   Totally agreed, though. Oh, Tumblr."

FemmeThoughts,30kyux,chocolatepot,6,Wed Apr 1 11:05:52 2015 UTC,"Your comments on this post have been removed for violating a number of subreddit rules.  This subreddit is not anti-femme. Nor is it homophobic or ""femmephobic"" to say that women wearing makeup and adhering to patriarchal beauty standards isn't feminist. It's not. That doesn't make wearing makeup a bad thing. That doesn't make shaving your legs a bad thing. It doesn't mean that you can't be a feminist and do those things.   Yes, looking femme is more complicated in the lesbian community where butchness is prized. And it may be radical within the confines of that community to choose femininity. But going against the grain within the lesbian community does not necessarily mean that your actions are inherently feminist.   Femmes are not hated here. In fact, I'm fairly certain that a majority of our female subscribers are femme. All that's being said is that being femme and performing femininity is not inherently feminist. Shaving your legs, wearing makeup, these are not acts that fight against the patriarchy. And that's okay. Not everything that a feminist does needs to be inherently feminist.   This also doesn't mean that if you choose to perform femininity that you are being brainwashed or that you love the patriarchy. Again, no one is saying that. When Ms. Sarkeesian talks about women not having choices, when people decry ""choice-feminism"" (also often known as liberal feminism), it is not to say that women have no agency and can't choose. It means that until women are fully liberated, those choices aren't fully real. Because they are made in a patriarchal environment. It's not about denying women's agency, but recognising that that agency is limited by the world we live in.  We have hundreds of studies on women and makeup, and how we're perceived. For example, in an office environment, if you don't wear makeup, you're perceived as failing to look professional and put together and you're penalized for it. If you wear too much, you're penalized for trying to hard, and being sexy. Yes, all women get to choose how to present themselves. For some women, looking femme is a way of conforming to their environment and pressures. For some women, looking femme is a way of rebelling against their environment and pressures. But all women live in a world that pays extraordinary attention to, and places a premium value on their looks. So yes, on an individual level, yes, any woman can choose to look femme. But when looking at and discussing societal structures, it's fair to say that that choices doesn't exist. Now you don't have to agree. You don't have to be a marxist or socialist here. Heck, you don't even have to be a feminist.   But, if you are going to participate in these sorts of academic discussions then you can't misrepresent these things. Your identity as a lesbian is not being attacked, nor is anyone saying that you have no agency. Nor is anyone ""shitting all over femmes"". In order to participate in these sorts of discussions here, you're going to need to be able to tell the difference between having your choices invalidated, and an academic discussion over whether or not choice is real within a patriarchal system. We don't allow anti-feminism, or misrepresentation of feminism.  Nor do we allow blatant misrepresentation in general. You are not allowed to put words in people's mouths here, or argue against things they didn't say. That's not okay.     If you have any questions or concerns, please message the moderators. Direct replies to official mod comments may be removed for further derailing. Thanks!"
FemmeThoughts,30kyux,chocolatepot,4,Sat Mar 28 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"""Choice feminism"" is generally used to refer to neo-liberal feminism that often claims that almost anything a woman chooses is feminist. It's feminism-light. It's more ""girl power"" than it is feminism. It's very capitalist. That's how you get people praising ads as feminist. That's how you get a feminism focused on women leaning in. There's a new organisation of heavy hitting women that's supposed to be ""feminist"". It's to advance women's networking and provide a place where women in male-dominated fields and positions can talk to each other and share tips and help each other out. But it's for a very limited group of women: tickets cost a ridiculous amount. Now sure, its great that women in those rarefied positions get that support network, but it also kinda misses the point.  To put it simply, choice feminism celebrates the successes of individual women within the capitalist, imperialist, patriarchy, instead of focusing on tearing down those systems.  Also, I'm a bit sceptical of this whole ""feminist policing"" you bring up. I see this complained about a whole lot, but I never actually see it happen. This complaint shows up at least once in any discussion thread on feminism, no matter how off-topic, often becoming the focal point of discussion. In fact, your comment sparked a thread that's mostly focused on looking feminine...even though that has little to do with the post.   I'm sure that there are some feminists out there, probably who've just discovered feminism and are trying to be as ""radical"" as possible who pressure other feminists this way. There's always someone out there doing something ridiculous. But at the rate it's mentioned in this subreddit alone, you'd think there were roving bands of feminists stealing people's razors. The few times someone in this sub has complained about being ""pressured"" by feminists not to shave or wear makeup...in their telling of the story, the feminists weren't doing that. All they were doing was refusing to call wearing makeup and shaving feminist. So can we please cool our jets with this? It's not a serious feminist issue, it's an issue of a few people out there being arseholes. And constantly bringing it up, and pretending that it's a real thing that we need to worry about...it's beginning to hugely derail all discussions of feminism."
FemmeThoughts,30kyux,hermithome,4,Sun Mar 29 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"I do understand what choice feminism as a whole is. What I'm wondering about is the specific choices that she's referring to as working within the patriarchy. Is it a critique of women who ""reclaim"" sex work, or who defend prostitution because ""most of the women do it voluntarily""? (THE WORST.) Women who start businesses that reinforce sexism?  I only recently joined the sub, and mostly it was because the ""femme"" in the label made me think it was going to be a place for exploring traditional femininity within feminism, which I hadn't previously seen as the basis for a forum. Obvi I realized the ""femme"" was not used in that sense fairly quickly, but thought I'd stick around and see what sets this sub apart from other feminist subs, what makes it different from /r/Feminism or /r/twoXchromosomes.   Also, I'm a bit sceptical of this whole ""feminist policing"" you bring up. I see this complained about a whole lot, but I never actually see it happen.   It hasn't happened frequently in actual interactions to me (rather than reading it in essays), and I don't consider it ""feminist policing"". I find the focus on the personal-as-feminist - from both sides, which each side gets worse about in response to criticism - extremely problematic and distracting. I didn't intend to have a discussion about makeup (obviously I could have helped by saying ""I disagree but I'm not talking about this right now,"" though), and I'm sorry that I did: I just thought someone else might have more context from Sarkeesian's other writing/videos or from something I overlooked, such as /u/Adahn5's helpful points.  I'm very active on /r/AskFeminists and am not an opponent of feminism. All I was saying is that I don't know if I support what she's saying there or not, because there's a lot she could mean. The only thing I know about her is that she criticizes sexism in video games and has been very unfairly treated by the internet in general."
FemmeThoughts,30kyux,chocolatepot,4,Sun Mar 29 02:52:55 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts on ""feminist policing"":  I think a big problem for feminists is how often feminism gets misrepresented by patriarch structures. In our world ""everything feminine"" is usually considered as less than ""everything masculine"". As a result people who (unconsciously) believe in this concept also believe the only way out of this situation for feminists is to abandon femininity. Without changing the value system this makes totally sense. When being a man is ultimately considered as better than being a woman the only way for equal treatment is becoming more like a man or at least less feminine. So for people, who believe in the ""traditional value system"", it might seem obvious that feminists have to be ""anti-femme"".  So what happens when a feminist criticizes some feminine behavior as being something that is born out of patriarchy? Some people will think the feminist wants to abandon this to become less feminine in an attempt to move within the traditional value system. Those people, who believe in the traditional value system (patriarchy), can easily confirm their expectations of feminists with this explanation. People who don't believe in the traditional value system (e.g. other feminists) might even get a similar idea because they might assume their fellow feminist thinks in terms of the traditional value system and wants to move via abandoning femininity within this value system without changing it."

FemmeThoughts,30kyux,chocolatepot,5,Sun Mar 29 17:43:25 2015 UTC,"All I was saying is that I don't know if I support what she's saying there or not, because there's a lot she could mean.   That's a fair statement, and there are a few, somewhat vague notions that she doesn't go into detail with. Hermithome did a tremendous job of explaining what ""Choice"" Feminism is, and why the choices women make are not full, or completely free, because they're still made within the context, framework and environment of Patriarchy.  Specifically on the matter of her perspective, Sarkeesian herself has said that she's only really delved into Feminist literature in the past few years, so it would be fair to say that her own philosophical, economic and ideological leanings are relatively nondescript. We can only assume, based on the people she quotes from, that she's developing both a deeper understanding and a more sophisticated and precise way of delivering that knowledge in turn.  /u/Sojourner_Truth described her past videos as ""fairly standard deconstructionist critique"", and something a lot of people have been doing for quite a while. It's standard fare because it conforms to a broad range of ideologies, both on the revolutionary left and liberal left. The gripes a Marxist-Feminist, or an Anarcha-Feminist might have with her works is principally that the analysis was incomplete.  Her mention of White Supremacy, and thus racism; Capitalism, and thus class struggle, materialism and economics is, I believe, the starting shift in her own narrative to understand these more complex, interconnected and intersectional systems of oppression that need to be dealt with hand in hand with Patriarchy.   Why does capitalism confine women to the lower steps of the hierarchy in the labour market? Why do austerity measures have gendered impacts? Why do some women debate the merits of pornography but not the powerful industry that drives it to ever more violent expression? How did we arrive at ‘choice feminism’, where everything from prostitution to make-up involves women’s choices that are considered empowering acts of feminism?   These are just some questions from an introduction about Left Unity: Men, women, race, socialism. It takes these from this article on Choice Feminism. Check it out if you have a spare moment, it makes the same points Hermithome made. From the concluding paragraphs:   Undeniably, choice is fundamental to feminism. But that does not mean that every choice we make is a feminist one. Choice, and the feminist context within which the slogan was born, has been de-politicized. Hey, we’re so free and empowered that we don’t even need the feminist movement anymore! See how dangerously easy it is to manipulate this rhetoric into something that actually limits choice for women?  I want real choices. I want to change the system within which those choices are made, not just use the language of choice to benefit or to comfort me. I want liberation from the forces that lead women into strip clubs, stilettos and Girls Gone Wild. I want collective empowerment, not temporary empowerment for only a few. I don’t want fake choices designed by the very mechanisms that oppressed women in the first place."

Ultimately, I think this is where my confusion is coming in, because I've met quite a few (people who identified as) choice feminists that would agree with this, so the definition of ""choice feminism"" I've had is one that is apparently ... softer? than it ought to be. ""I have the right to make the choice"" vs. ""all choices are inherently equal""."
FemmeThoughts,30kyux,freeasabrd,2,Sun Mar 29 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"I only recently joined the sub, and mostly it was because the ""femme"" in the label made me think it was going to be a place for exploring traditional femininity within feminism, which I hadn't previously seen as the basis for a forum.    I honestly don't think you'll to find a group like that. Femme is the default for women, including feminists. You could find groups for exploring femininity within lesbianism, where femme is not always the default and more politically charged, but I don't think you'd find a group exploring femininity within feminism. Traditional femininity is also patriarchal and born of patriarchy, so it's a bit of a counter-intuitive mix you're looking for.   There are subs focused around the opposite. For example, there's /r/razorfree, /r/Topfreedom, /r/brafree. But it's not exactly like you'd need groups for the opposite. Most women, including feminists, shave, wear bras and keep their shirts on outside. Being a woman, and a feminist and femme is not exactly ground breaking or rare. Most women are femme, feminists included. I don't even know what a group like you imagined would focus on or explore.   I find the focus on the personal-as-feminist - from both sides, which each side gets worse about in response to criticism - extremely problematic and distracting.    I have zero idea what you're talking about here. None. I don't know what you consider ""both sides"", I don't know what criticism you're talking about, and I just have zero idea what you are attempting to say. Frankly, it sounds like you're desperately trying to find middle ground to stand on, middle ground that I don't even think exists. Please be careful about this, because we have rules against false equivalences here. Can you actually explain what the two sides are, how they are criticising each other, and how they respond to that criticism with a personal focus? If so, please do. If not, please avoid making over generic statements like this where you blame everyone to find a middle ground.    I'm very active on /r/AskFeminists and am not an opponent of feminism.    I didn't say that you were opposing feminism. I explained ""choice feminism"" and then took issue with something you said, and noted that it was part of a larger trend that I found to be disturbing and derailing. I'm really trying to avoid putting my mod hat on here, so I'm just going to ask you to be a bit more careful and precise. Don't put words in people's mouths, don't defend against stuff you haven't been accused of, etc. If you are uncertain about how to interpret something someone said, just ask what they meant.   Also, heads up...if you want to continue to be active on /r/AskFeminists, you may want to cultivate an alt. It's not really a feminist sub, and the owner tends to ban users for...well, read this.   All I was saying is that I don't know if I support what she's saying there or not, because there's a lot she could mean.    Not really. There isn't a ""lot she could mean"". You called her position ""semi-meaningless"" without details as to which choices she was discussing. Just because you don't know what ""choice feminism"" is, doesn't mean that the criticism is so vague as to be meaningless. Sarkeesian didn't invent the term, and is in fact, referring to something fairly specific. I get that it can be difficult to understand everything she's saying if you don't understand the underlying principles and concepts that she refers to, but it's okay to ask. Or google first, and then ask. Googling for ""choice feminist"" gets you a lot of good results. If you don't know, it's unfair to criticise as though you do. In the same way that people who hear the term ""privileged"" have a knee-jerk reaction and assume they know what it means, you heard ""choice feminism"" and assumed that it didn't have a specific meaning, but was just an overly vague description. That's not cool."
FemmeThoughts,30kyux,AaronBCu,6,Sun Mar 29 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think you'll to find a group like that. [...] Being a woman, and a feminist and femme is not exactly ground breaking or rare.   I realize both of these things. That's why I thought it was interesting and wanted to investigate further.   Just because you don't know what ""choice feminism"" is, doesn't mean that the criticism is so vague as to be meaningless.   I do know what the concept of choice feminism is. But from my perspective, it's a spectrum. I've seen people identifying as choice feminists who range from fairly reasonable beings that are basically trying to deal with themselves as humans whose personalities have been formed in part by socialization, to unreasonable ones who don't appear to live in the same world as the rest of us (eg my previous example of insisting that all sex work is voluntary and equal). So when someone makes a remark about choice feminism, I genuinely don't know if they mean literally all choice feminism or from a certain point on the spectrum to the end of it. I used to be on a forum with someone who would dismiss third-wave feminism as a whole because it was too wishy-washy, though, so I'm probably oversensitive.   I have zero idea what you're talking about here.   I didn't put it well because I was flustered. Some places seem to breed this idea that the main form of activism is justifying what you personally like, whether it's a practice or a tv show or a style. And I spend too much time there and end up accidentally falling into the same patterns.  Thank you for letting me know about /r/AskFeminists; I've been posting there for a few weeks and had no idea it was run by an MRA. (Though the lack of moderation should have been a clue ... I thought it was just considered self-policing.) Very unfortunate. I've unsubscribed from it, because as much as the feminists who comment there are extremely good at it, I don't feel comfortable with that. Could do without the stress of banging my head against the wall, anyway.  I honestly don't know how I managed to stumble into coming across as a total neophyte when I think about many of these issues quite a lot of the time. I suppose it's because I'm more used to conversing with other people about gender in history than contemporary activism. I'm sorry to have caused you trouble."

Okay, yeah, absolutely, but that happens with everything. I don't know when someone identifies as a radical feminist what they mean. Or an ____ feminist. That's because a lot of people use terms for something other than their academic meaning. It's really frustrating, because that tends to get in the way of productive discussion. For example, I just read a blog post by someone who identifies as a choice feminist because she thinks that she should get to best decide how to deal with oppression and that others shouldn't decide for her. Which I absolutely, 100% agree with, but that's also not choice feminism. Here, we generally assume that someone is using the academic meaning for a term, unless proven otherwise. Otherwise it's pretty much impossible to have any sort of discussion at all. It's especially safe to make that assumption in this context, because she's fairly academic all the way through her speech.    Some places seem to breed this idea that the main form of activism is justifying what you personally like, whether it's a practice or a tv show or a style.   Yup...this is part and parcel of choice feminism and neo-liberal feminism. Have whatever kind of wedding you want, but for the love of all that's holy, please don't spend pages trying to explain to me how using an alternative colour scheme makes your wedding feminist.   Could do without the stress of banging my head against the wall, anyway.   Heh, no kidding. Most people aren't there to ask in good faith. Could be more accurately named rBaitFeminists.    I honestly don't know how I managed to stumble into coming across as a total neophyte when normally I have people annoyed at me for being too much of a feminist. I suppose it's because I'm more used to conversing about gender in history than contemporary activism. I'm sorry to have caused you trouble.   Actually, I'd guess that it has more to do with what forums you're used to. We've noticed that there's a significant adjustment period here. New users tend to be a bit overly defensive, couching their positions a lot, doing a lot of equivocating and stuff. Most of our users come here from less-friendly reddit forums. It's hard to be a feminist online, and in most places in the internet that requires commenting with shields up and assuming the worst. We're trying to be more active in the comment sections and correct this behaviour in as friendly a way as possible, because we want our users to be able to clearly and openly discuss stuff here. Not a trouble at all."

Most people aren't there to ask in good faith.   Oh, definitely. I took a kind of pride in not rising to it, though. ""Ha! You thought you could get me to say something to prove that safe haven laws are a double standard in favor of women, and instead I made rational arguments that you have no answer to.""   Most of our users come here from less-friendly reddit forums.   See, I have started using Reddit more and more over the past few weeks (I nabbed the name ages ago, but didn't start posting until recently), but some time prior to that I was on a pretty feminist forum. But it was a very cranky, fighty feminist forum, sometimes with feminists trolling as misogynists for a warped form of entertainment. And of course Tumblr, with the aforementioned feminism-based-on-like (""Rose is the most feminist companion and Clara is the worst!"" ""No, OPPOSITE!"" ""You are the worst feminist!"" ""No, YOU!"") and emotional blackmail. Probably it made me cautious of appearing to take a side."
FemmeThoughts,30m0pt,SolidBlues,3,Sat Mar 28 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like some editing could improve things a bit.  For example, this sentence:   Non-men, people who are neither women nor men, but still suffer patriarchal oppression, and thus for the purpose of this discussion are treated the same as women – both cis and trans – however, we want to keep the discussion centered on feminism as an expression of women’s politics whether cis or trans, not genderqueer struggle – which includes besides trans women and non-binary people, men, like trans men, whose experience of patriarchy is different from that of cis or trans women, and which has its own separate history from feminism, even if indeed proletarian feminism is queer struggle.    I'm honestly not sure what's being said here, but I'm quite sure that it would be clearer if broken up into several complete sentences.  :)"
FemmeThoughts,30m0pt,codayus,5,Sun Mar 29 04:04:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had that difficulty too. I could generally decipher those paragraphs, but that's probably because I'm an editor and my job is to read paragraphs like that, figure out what the author meant to say, and help reconstruct them and explain what the issue is. And even still, it's not easy.  Some good points, but they do need an editor."
FemmeThoughts,30m0pt,hermithome,2,Sun Mar 29 05:26:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Most of it comes across as a bit convoluted. But a lot of very good points as you said. Ghandy's Proletarian Feminist theory boils down to these points, and I'll use Silvia Federici's Feminist Critique of Marx to support the article itself:   Historical materialism that goes hand-in-hand with Patriarchy, which is to say Patriarchy is tied to the class oppression and is not an independent or additional system of oppression. What this does is make the methodology of doing away with Patriarchy the same as doing away with class oppression: achieving a classless society, which is to say Communism.   It makes the claim that Patriarchy isn't new, it didn't creep up on us alongside Capitalism, nor is it a remnant of Feudalism or Slavery. Capitalism, however has been very smart about how it's incorporated Patriarchy to its oppressive, exploitative nature:   “Capitalism has become aware that if it completely ignores or suppresses this resistance it might become more and more radical, eventually turning into a movement for self-reliance and perhaps even the nucleus of a new social order.” – Robert Biel, The New Imperialism (2000)   The anti-Capitalist approach, then, is as much a necessity to Feminism, and should be as intrinsic to the movement, as the inverse of Capitalism and Patriarchy.   It rejects biological determinism, the sectioning off by the Capitalist Patriarchy to divide labour along binary lines according to gender roles assigned through either forced or voluntary social constructs of a binary based on biology:    Capitalist production relies on the production of a particular type of worker, and therefore a particular type of family, sexuality, procreation, and thus to redefine the private sphere as a sphere of relations of production and a terrain of anti-capitalist struggle. In this context, policies forbidding abortion could be decoded as devices for the regulation of the labor supply, the collapse of the birth rate and increase in the number of divorces could be read as instances of resistance to the capitalist discipline of work. The personal became political and capital and the state were found to have subsumed our lives and reproduction down to the bedroom.    It seeks to restructure the family not in terms of abolishing it as a social unit, but as an economic one that perpetuates the exploitation of Capitalism through the Patriarchal establishment of gender roles which reinforce the structural modes of production, reproduction and further solidify gender oppression and its own domination by turning the family unit into an instrument of those very systems:    We have also witnessed an increase of male violence against women, triggered in part by fear of economic competition, in part by the frustration men experience not being able to fulfill their role as family providers, and most important, triggered by the fact that men now have less control over women’s bodies and work, as more women have some money of their own and spend more time outside the home. In a context of falling wages and widespread unemployment that makes it difficult for them to have a family, many men also use women’s bodies as a means of exchange and access to the world market, through the organization of pornography or prostitution.   There are many more points, but the article is worth reading, or at least skimming. It's in bullet-point form, with a conclusion which simply states the following:   People’s liberation is impossible without women’s liberation, so fighting for women’s liberation, against patriarchy and patriarchal dominance, is critical for the liberation of all people. At the same time, this liberation is not merely an exercise of moralism or legalistic change, but a revolutionary transformation of the whole world and society – not just of patriarchy, but of class society and all that entails. That is where we as proletarian feminists and communists stand, and that is what we mean when we say we are proletarian feminists.   This change and this struggle will not occur simply by engaging in a struggle within the realm of production, Federici would say, for ""as long as reproductive work is devalued, as long as it is considered a private matter and women’s responsibility, women will always confront capital and the state with less power than men, and in conditions of extreme social and economic vulnerability.""  Last point, which is important and which we on the sub touched on during the International Working Women's Day:  Proletarian Feminism stands as an obscured Feminism because of ""anti-communist propaganda or sectarian denialism.""   A very relevant example of this erasure by bourgeois feminism is the capture and erasure of proletarian women of the International Working Women’s Day into the International Women’s Day. Another example is the ignorance of the advanced nature of the practices and rules within existing people’s armies, such as the New People’s Army having marriage between people of all genders since the late 1990s.   Anyway, that was my two cents + slight sum-up of the article x3 Hopefully it's not longer than the article itself is."

My alma mater didn't offer gender studies, and I was grateful at least to have been able to take a Women's Literature course, where thankfully the professor was well-versed enough to at least give an intersectional analysis of systems, gender roles and Patriarchy.  But is it, though, in your University Solid, and others?"

FemmeThoughts,30j8ei,helloiamsilver,11,Sat Mar 28 16:39:35 2015 UTC,I do wonder if this is a case of bad software. Is there a way to report photos as inappropriate? I know many sites just take stuff down rather than manually look at photos.
FemmeThoughts,30j8ei,thatsnotgneiss,7,Sat Mar 28 00:02:24 2015 UTC,Most sites don't do this in an automated fashion.

I haven't shaved my legs since the beginning of November, because it has been cold enough that any dresses I have worn this winter necessitate tights. Now that it is getting warmer, I will begin once again to shave my legs at least once a week. It will never explicitly be said in my place of work that shaved legs are required, but there is a heavy societal expectation that I have to shave my legs and I would not be taken seriously by clients if I showed up in a pretty sundress with inch-long leg hairs.   Shaving my legs is a time-consuming, tedious process and I am blessed to have blond body hair so that I only have to shave once a week in warm weather. I know other women who not only have to shave their legs every 3 days because of their dark body hair, but they also feel that they have to shave or wax their arms too because the dark hair is unattractive.   It's an INSANE amount of time to spend removing something that is completely natural and will eventually grow back anyway."

If I want to show my legs, I have to shave every day. It used to be twice a day before I got a nice DE razor and learned how to do properly.  My arms are really hairy and dark too.  I remember I started shaving them in 2nd grade because some kids made some comments about it along with my unibrow. I casually mentioned it to my mom a couple years later and she told me that I didn't need to do that because I was beautiful and shaving your arms sucks so I stopped.   It stills bothers me sometimes but I honestly don't have the time or patience to shave my arms on top of what I already do. The whole body hair is gross and somehow unclean is so ridiculous because everyone has it. Yet so many people feel that way. My mom, the same woman who told me that I didn't need to shave my arms, made fun of me with her friend when we went for a walk and you could see some very light hair above my knees. I was 14."

See, I'm conflicted on this. Because while there's definitely an inequity in casual wear, when it comes to a professional environment, neither men nor women are expected to expose hairy legs. The difference there is that women have the option to depilate their legs and put them on display, whereas there is no professional attire for men that reveals their legs, period.  So I want society to ignore women's hairy legs while jogging or going to the market or whatever, just as they do with men... but I can't quite bring myself to expect that my hairy legs (and they are VERY hairy right now) should be considered appropriate for the work environment.

Now that you put it that way, I requestion my stance."
FemmeThoughts,30f49i,revolutionary_geese,5,Thu Mar 26 21:24:20 2015 UTC,"Tamora Pierce - basically all of her books. It's YA fiction but still my favourite author and I probably wouldn't be the woman I am today without them. A lot of characters happen to be gay/black/trans but it's not obvious because it doesn't define them - so you may find it out halfway through the book.  Also, a lot of multi dimensional characters (male and female) etc."

FemmeThoughts,30f49i,Adahn5,1 point,Fri Mar 27 04:29:52 2015 UTC,"hermithome gave some fantastic recommendations, but to add a few to hers:  Fiction   Oryx & Crake by Margaret Atwood.   Non-Fiction   ""Thinking Class: Sketches from a Cultural Worker"" by Joanna Kadi ""Thinking Through: Essays in Marxism, Feminism and Anti-Racism"" by Himani Bannerji ""Returning the Gaze: : Essays on Gender, Race and Class by Non-White Women"" (written by a number of people)   I figure if you liked Animal Farm and The Road, ""Oryx & Crake"" may hold some appeal with its dystopian core and narratives on class and humanity.  And I can't honestly pass any thread like this without pushing Joanna Kadi and Himani Bannerji. I love their writings...Kadi's 'Thinking Class' delves into class, race, culture, and more than fires a shot across the bow of capitalism and its toxic influence over the working class. Bannerji is a fantastic voice on the impact of non-intersectional feminism, and covers ground on intersectionality and similar areas as Joanna Kadi, very interested in power dynamics.  I kept my list to those, as those are what I return to often for a fiftieth or sixtieth read :P"
FemmeThoughts,30at6k,ruchenn,13,Wed Mar 25 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"That would be great. It's a hard condition to deal with, and I've had to quit a job over it.  It is also one of those ""invisible"" illnesses in many ways and it's been impossible to persuade a few people (most notably, my mother-in-law) that it's real and really debilitating.  It is really a ridiculously frustrating condition; you suddenly can't do much of what you could before--for example, I used to have to sit and take a break halfway through my three-block walk to the bus stop, whereas when I'm not pregnant I can walk three miles like it's nothing."
FemmeThoughts,30at6k,Grave_Girl,12,Thu Mar 26 01:29:52 2015 UTC,"Severe morning sickness is like recovering from chemo. I don't know how anyone could argue that constant nausea, gagging, and vomiting, isn't a disability. It's certainly disabling. I know it's temporary, but 6-9 months is a long type of temporary.   Every pregnancy is different, because every woman is hit differently by the hormones and the hormones also interact with the baby somehow. Some people are genuinely disabled, some just inconvenienced, but it always takes an enormous toll on your body. The stuff it does to your brain is also intense, shit, some people kill their kids after desperately wanting them for years. Hormones are no joke.   Sometimes women, especially those with ""easy"" pregnancies do something rather self involved, and claim that how it was for them must be universal. ""Oh come on! It's not that hard!"" and this is terribly unfair, as well as flatly untrue.   Some women get a glossy head of hair, glowing skin, a sense of peace, renewed energy, a relaxed last trimester and mildly uncomfortable labor. Some women are anemic, pimply, exhausted, with terrible mood swings, nausea, migraines, pelvic bones pulling apart, abdomen separating, post partum depression.   We'd like, as women, to not allow child bearing to interfere with our right to work, so it's very tempting to claim that pregnancy isn't a disability and should not be treated like one. But it's important not to deny the reality of the lives of other women. Pregnancy doesn't slow some women down at all, but others can really use help and understanding.   TL;DR: Pregnancy is not inherently a disability, but it absolutely can be."

FemmeThoughts,307lp3,lovelybone93,97,Wed Mar 25 02:48:06 2015 UTC,"Well, at the very least, it's incredibly invalidating. Regardless of the gender of the person it's said to, what that is saying is that their emotions don't matter, and that they're looks do.  But of course, there's an obvious gender component. This is something almost exclusively aimed at women, by men. The invalidation is happening because their looks are being prioritised over their feelings. It would absolutely be appropriate to call it sexist or misogynistic."
FemmeThoughts,307lp3,hermithome,19,Wed Mar 25 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"Basically my thoughts on it. I got downvoted in troll x (troll y myself) for commenting in a similar way. Is it like two x, to be avoided?"
FemmeThoughts,307lp3,hermithome,21,Wed Mar 25 03:27:42 2015 UTC,"It's not as bad, but it faces many of the same problems that twox does. There's a lot of mod overlap, and the same mod attitude. TrollX isn't as bad because it isn't as exposed, but the more and more popular it's become, the worse and worse it's gotten. I've started avoiding it more and more.  EDIT: Just to clarify, I saw the thread, and the person who responded to you either deleted their own comment or it was removed by the mods, so there's that. Overall, it was a fairly decent thread."
FemmeThoughts,307lp3,Subclavian,4,Wed Mar 25 03:29:57 2015 UTC,What's with the mods consistently not modding very well? The best mods on there don't overlap.
FemmeThoughts,307lp3,hermithome,8,Wed Mar 25 18:11:50 2015 UTC,"It's not a problem of individual mods, it's a problem of how the top people have decided the sub should be moderated. Click here to read our warning on 2xc and their modding choices. Most of the top mods overlap, and it's the top mods who choose what type of moderation they want. In most subs, mods aren't free to do whatever, they're generally following a set of rules or guidelines, and those are generally set by the top mod, or top few mods. This leads to a lot of mod drama on reddit, as often the lower ranking mods are doing all of the work, but aren't free to make policy changes.  In the case of twox and trollx, I can't speak to how the work is divided. But that warning shows quite clearly that the people running things have a very different idea for the community than the people using them."
FemmeThoughts,307lp3,VineBasil,2,Wed Mar 25 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"Wow, what happened in your warning about TwoX is exactly what happened to me.  (And then I logged out and forgot my password, so this is a new account with a similar name.)  I'm just surprised.  Granted I have a tendency to sound angrier than I am but that recent 2x post that blew up had a point - all the womens voices have become weak and meek, stronger womens voices are considered problem children, meanwhile the MRAs rule the roost.  So we're left with a feminist forum in which the women are cowed by the authoritative-sounding idiots who wish to keep them down and the actual feminist thought slides to the right instead of staying on the left where it belongs, i.e. women policing women (of course) and relying on censorship to maintain a status quo that only helps the women who are comfortable within that framework - secondary to a strong man's opinion, regardless of content.    Eventually all that will happen on that forum is the level-headed males of reddit will call out the MRAs and in turn become the patriarchal guides: individual womens issues won't be validated until a kind man offers condolences and advice and women will only make posts complaining about other women, and actual feminist discussion will be very status quoey. I've seen that happen before.    I just had to vent, feel free to delete this comment but don't shadowban me please, I just got here, haha."
FemmeThoughts,307lp3,hermithome,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:37:40 2015 UTC,"TwoX was never intended as a feminist forum. Ever. It was always a women's forum, and the top mods have a very specific idea of what that means. It's a ladies forum. They value decorum and soft voices and being nice. They think that advocating for change is being a troublemaker. It's just awful."

The problem is, that that power slowly wanes as more people find the sub, and the mods don't do much.  One of the roles of mods is coming down hard on people who don't follow community rules and getting rid of them. It's the only way to maintain an online community where all you have to do is click a button to participate. You need to draw lines."

Although, I've definitely been told I'm cute when I'm angry (or specifically grumpy). It seems that I resemble a 6 foot tall Snubble (Transcript: Picture of adorable grumpy pokemon.

FemmeThoughts,307lp3,FreyjaSunshine,19,Sat Apr 25 04:23:23 2015 UTC,"It's condescending/invalidating and I usually hear it said to women.

My SO has told me before that when I am angry/grumpy he DOES think I look cute, but he knows and respects that my feelings in that moment are legitimate so he would never actually tell me I look cute because that would be incredibly patronizing."
FemmeThoughts,307lp3,my_flower,4,Wed Mar 25 14:20:31 2015 UTC,"Well, after the feeling has passed, it's not as bad to say that. But patronizing someone only pisses them off more."

I encourage all of the users involved in this thread, or who share similar sentiments, to review our subreddit rules.  The Tough Mother Challenge is not anti-father, or attempting to humiliate men. Nor does recognising the way things are and attempting to get people to pay attention to that ""perpetuate stereotypes"".  The truth is that the vast majority of housework and childcare is taken on by women, not men. This doesn't mean that men can't do this work, or that there aren't men doing this work, but in most cases, most of this work is done by women. And it can be difficult for people who don't do this work to appreciate just how hard it can be.   This challenge is designed to emulate the hecticness, variety and overwhelming responsibility of being the primary caretaker. The idea is that the person who isn't the primary caretaker gets a bit of a taste of what it's like, so that they can better understand what their partner goes through. It's not about humiliation or shaming, it's about understanding and experiencing.  Additionally, you do not get to decide how women should handle their private lives. It is inappropriate to saddle them with the weight of forcing a huge societal change. It is even more inappropriate to do so, and then take issue with how they chose to tackle it.

FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,liah,28,Mon Mar 23 02:42:57 2015 UTC,"Traditional ""femininity"" is very much a performance for me. How I speak when I'm at work is totally different from how I speak normally-- a much higher pitch, ending sentences on more of an upward-tilt (like it's a question), being less likely to interject and more likely to try to pacify, etc. And it's exhausting.  I knew I'd never be able to mimic the movements though (swaying hips, balancing delicately on heels, etc.), nor have I ever needed to. Being tall, long-armed and wide-hipped, I take up a lot of space physically, so I always knew that sort of thing wasn't destined to be in my wheelhouse.  That said, I certainly don't feel ""masculine."" I guess my version of womanhood just doesn't align with either binary's expectations. :)"

Whilst at work, I'll be polite and quiet and well-mannered and will always sit up straight! I also think it's how comfortable you are with people.  I think that the hip-swaying and heel walking came naturally for me. One day I put a pair of heels on and I never needed to practice, I just walked and walked easily.  I don't feel masculine but I don't feel overly feminine either, but I like it like that. A perfect combination of the two I think."

After I became more aware of problems women faced in my school/industry (things like, if someone wears a dress to their team meeting, they aren't listened to and are taken less seriously), I decided that I should start being more feminine (wearing dresses, nicer clothing in general, makeup, etc) so that I could demand that people take feminine women seriously, and thus stand up for women.   I definitely practice femininity. My friends are still teaching me fashion and make up. It's a process that I am still going through."

I remember in elementary school, watching cartoons and mimicking how the female characters would bat their eyelashes and for a while in fifth grade I would open up my eyes as much as possible so it looked like I had big eyes (which I thought would be attractive, for some reason)."

Nothing like a few smacks and ""that's not lady like""'s to set me straightfemale.  My peers and what I've been/still am exposed to through the media has a major influence on how I behave.

FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,looseleafliesoflow,24,Mon Mar 23 09:20:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a trans woman. Pre-transition, before my gender identity was fully aparent, I sometimes found myself moving in ways that seemed, at least to me, a bit feminine. I berated myself for it.  In most other ways, I don't think I was particularly feminine. When I discovered I was actually female and started my transition, I definitely did a lot of self-policing and practicing at femininity. At least in my case, I think that was partly a survival thing, seeing as how passing privilege is a thing. The consequences of not passing can range anywhere from embarrassing to deadly. But I also felt compelled to live up to societal expectations for their own sake."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,so_jelly,7,Mon Mar 23 03:34:48 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I'm also trans. Large amounts of testosterone in my system made me feel crazy.

The physical changes are nice, but I would still take estrogen if they didn't happen. So I can totally see how someone could pursue that without ever planning to have surgery."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,tganon123,5,Mon Mar 23 14:18:48 2015 UTC,"Isn't the desire to identify gender as female a little bit of a stereotype in itself   Transgender women don't desire to identify as female.  They do identify as female.  They might desire to present as female, so that people perceive them as the gender they identify as.    Why identify as a woman?  Because some people feel like it.  Personally, I identify as 'genderqueer'.  I am MAAB (male-assigned-at-birth), but I identify as not falling within the socially constructed gender norms.  I feel like I am in the middle somewhere, exactly like your ""why not"" scenario.  Other people identify strongly as one gender or the other.  Most people seem to, in fact.  Many of those people identify as the gender they were assigned at birth.    But some do not.  And it isn't a 'stereotype' to do this.  It's just how a lot of people feel, and it's a legitimate way to feel."

FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,esobelle,9,Mon Mar 23 17:21:57 2015 UTC,"I never had to practice my voice, as I am told it is naturally feminine.  On the other hand, my natural gait was very awkward.  I used to have flat feet, and although I had my arches corrected, I guess I had a holdover gait.  It was more like I was flinging myself from place to place.  I was constantly breaking toes on doorjambs and running into things.  It really wasn’t working for me.    Eventually, when I was about fifteen, a friend took pity on me and spent several weeks teaching me to walk with grace and poise.  The hip swaying and all that.  It was so difficult at first!  I worked very hard on it.  (My whole femme suit was the only thing that kept people from mistreating me at that age, so it was of deep importance to me.)  It feels natural now, though, except when I've just woken up.  Actually, I learned another gait the following year, from another friend.  This one was for keeping men from pestering me, which had become a problem since I had appropriated the previously mentioned graceful gait.  The gait I learned when I was sixteen involved walking at a great speed while slouching and glaring, and was often augmented by steel-toed boots.  That one served me very well for many years whenever I was trying to walk down the street.  I still use a more adult version of it in iffy neighborhoods."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,junjunjenn,6,Mon Mar 23 18:23:26 2015 UTC,"HAHA! Yes, the please don't talk to me or look at me walk. Is it subconscious for you now? Or do you have to consciously switch your gait?"

FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,blinkingsandbeepings,8,Mon Mar 23 11:30:11 2015 UTC,"I don't remember ever consciously practicing it. On the other hand, I have a fraternal twin brother and he once told me that he had to consciously teach himself to move and talk like a boy because he realized at a young age that he was ""naturally"" performing feminine mannerisms.  We probably both picked up those mannerisms from watching our mother and female nanny, who were around a lot more than our dad and any other adult men were."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,Bacon_Bitz,6,Mon Mar 23 19:37:57 2015 UTC,I think a lot of men are this way.  In the same way we try to be a little more feminine they try to be more manly.

I'm tall and fat and broad shouldered so sometimes I feel like i lumber like a linebacker or something.  I have a naturally deep voice, not husky just in a lower tone, like I used to occasionally sing men's parts in choir. I used to be self conscious of it when I was younger but I actually do think it is pretty feminine as a whole, just deeper... idk how to explain it. All the men I have been with have said that yeah it's kinda deep for a girl but that they like it when I brought it up. I have caught myself subconsciously making it higher pitched or adding that feminine questioning lilt to it in professional situations though and when I really think about it that actually bothers me."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,Kissina,10,Mon Mar 23 16:28:36 2015 UTC,"I never really thought about this but it's true. Growing up we're told to cross our legs, or make sure we keep our dresses creased down. Our femininity is nurtured and encouraged. We learn a lot through play as children. I think my femininity has been engrained over the years through play. I would dress up as a child, with my friends and by myself.   Even today I'll dress up or experiment with a certain style, makeup or hair to see how it will be perceived by myself and others. Our femininity is defined by culture and we try best to adhere to it if want to be perceived well by others. I want to be included in society and at least found presentable."

I hated them and felt like they were slowing me down (I played sports). I love my boobs now, but still hate my period. I don't hate being a woman, I actually am completely comfortable in my body, but I never tried to emulate femininity. Although since my hair is long now, I cut it really short a couple years ago, no one thinks of me as masculine. Well at least at first they don't, though some insult me by saying, ""I like you, you're not like most women"" (ugh hate when people say that) But yeah. I would say most of my ""female"" traits were subconsciously picked up and not intentionally learned."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,Halysites,4,Mon Mar 23 06:51:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting question! I'm a very masculine woman; in how I talk, act, dress, and even in some of my hobbies. I've been a tomboy for as long as I can remember, and went through a few ""feminine"" phases in high school more to fit in and get attention than anything.  Whenever I have worn makeup, dressed up, put on heels, etc. and tried to act in more of a feminine manner (at parties, on dates, etc.) I've always been uncomfortable. I can't strut, do eye flutters, mimic a sexy, soft tone, none of that stuff (things that would be characterized as more feminine). It's never been natural, in fact, it's always felt very unnatural to me.  I've given up in trying to act, talk, behave, or dress in a more traditionally feminine way. I wear women's clothes (mostly), but lots of jeans, khakis, practical outdoor clothes, but sometimes dresses because they can be comfy. I haven't worn makeup in over a year, I don't even own any anymore. I stopped shaving my armpits months ago. I notice when I talk with my boyfriend or people I know well that I speak in a more masculine tone, I move in a more masculine way, my walking is more of an aggressive trudge than a sexy strut. In new social settings I tone it down a bit, my voice might be quieter, I move more carefully. That might be more nerves than anything, or perhaps not wanting to be automatically judged as a tomboy.  I've never identified with some feminine things as well. Barbies and dolls? Only when I played with female friends. Most of the time as a kid I was playing war or pretending to be a dinosaur. When I played make believe, I always wanted to be male characters like the Red Ranger or Han Solo, never female characters. I wasn't into princess stuff, or even music made by women. Hell, I even dream that I'm a dude sometimes... I'm very happy being a woman, but ""masculinity"" and masculine things appeals more to me and feels more natural than stereotypically feminine behaviours, hobbies, etc. I'm basically a carbon copy of my Dad - we look, talk, think, and act similarly - so I figure I've probably been subconsciously picking up on all his habits and using those to form my own. Which probably also explains my penchant for beer, cigars, fishing, and hunting."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,Bacon_Bitz,5,Mon Mar 23 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"Serious question,  how does your boyfriend feel about the hairy armpits? (I personally could give up shaving my legs but I can't stand hairy armpits!)"
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,Halysites,6,Mon Mar 23 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"He does't mind it at all! He said it was different when I first grew them out, but he never notices. As for my legs, I only wax them once every few months, so I often have super hairy legs. He doesn't mind that either, but I'm not fully committed to full-time hairy legs. My boyfriend is really open minded which is one of the many reasons why I love him."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,DarlaDimpleAMA,3,Mon Mar 23 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"I did, indeed, practice a particular walk, and way of moving, to the point where I now do them without thinking, but these definitely aren't feminine as one would think of it. The walk is quite aggressive and the movement is graceful but not delicate. I save the most aggressive form of the walk for when I'm walking in sketchy areas, although I've also found myself slipping into it when I'm really pissed off. The overall impression of both walk and movement is subtly threatening, which comes in handy since I'm a small and otherwise non-imposing woman. But boy, do people respect the hell out of my personal space when I do it.   As for my voice, thanks to four years of cheerleading during my formative years, I have a pretty low speaking register with no vocal fry, so though my voice is not unfeminine, I don't really have issues with people taking me seriously or not because of uptalk or vocal fry. Think Lauren Bacall."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,rbrvsk,3,Mon Mar 23 18:00:50 2015 UTC,"Um.  I guess I'm kind of both. I lean more towards being naturally feminine because I have a pretty high, feminine voice. I walk in a pretty feminine manner, too - I've never had many issues with heels, either, other than lack of practice because I don't wear them often. I never had to practice it or anything. Feminine speech patterns also just come naturally to me, like saying ""I think"" at the beginnings of sentences, but that's partially because I need the time to gather my thoughts. I've had to practice to be MORE assertive, but I'd argue it's because I'm just not very assertive or confrontational to begin with :)  I don't know where it came from because the vast majority of the women I grew up around are not feminine. I have always been picked out as the girly one but I'm fine with that haha. It's just who I am :)"
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,Floofeh,4,Thu Apr 23 06:03:55 2015 UTC,"My voice is naturally high-pitched, but I feel that the feminine speech patterns of lacking confidence (constantly using uncertainty indicators like ""I think"" or ""maybe"", rising pitch like when making assertions, etc.) were kind of hammered into your consciousness when being a teenage girl. You needed to be demure, question yourself and defer to authority, otherwise you'd be told you were bossy or worse. I still remember getting lower grade for manner/behaviour - yes, that is a thing where I live :) - than my female friends in junior high because I didn't project this ideal of femininity as much as they did.  Walking/moving femininely is something I also learnt, largely from pop culture, but also from what got you praise from peers and partners. Funnily enough I've started unlearning some of these patterns (specifically curving your spine and swaying hips) in physiotherapy after a back injury, apparently moving that way is not good for you.  A lot of the time I still feel awkward when I'm among more feminine girls though, because what they do never came naturally to me and I sometimes feel like less of a woman for it, even though I know I shouldn't feel that way and make conscious efforts to unlearn some of the patterns. I guess that's the kind of conflicts gender roles put us in; damned if you do, damned if you don't."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,plasticcastle,6,Mon Mar 23 16:55:02 2015 UTC,"I think I subconsciously picked it up from my mother and my peers. I find that I change my voice and demeanor according to the situation. For example, when I'm with some high school friends (I'm currently in college) I have a more tomboyish way of carrying myself and a lower voice that's really fast. Basically the way I was when I met those people. In another group when there's fewer of us I tend to be like the team mom in that I'm more gentle and calm in my way of talking. If there's someone in there that I fancy romantically I know that I'm acting differently, but I can't pinpoint how. I don't really know how to purposely act sexy or flirty. My walk is always the same, I don't really know the right buttons to push, haha."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,baby_eats_dingo,2,Mon Mar 23 13:18:10 2015 UTC,"I'm very feminine and have been told that I'm very sexy, but it isn't conscious and I didn't practice it. I don't wear heels very often because I can't walk in them, and I think a lot of what people mean when they say I'm sexy is that I'm very petite, have a tiny waist and an hourglass shape etc. I also have a quiet voice, so if people want to hear me speaking they have to lean in a bit, but if they're tall I have to lean up towards them and sometimes have to brace myself on their shoulder. So it creates a very intimate space, but it isn't deliberate or contrived."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,gogogadgetpants_,2,Mon Mar 23 09:26:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting question! I definitely never rehearsed my voice or movements. How fascinating to learn that people did! My voice is fairly low for a female, but not deep enough to sound masculine. I would characterize my walk and movements as confident, which I've always attributed to being sporty as a kid. I was never that into makeup or super feminine clothes growing up, but I wear dresses, skirts, heels etc when I feel like it. I actually love dressing up but I don't wear things that are uncomfortable. I've grown to like make-up and hairstyling probably because I've become more practiced, but I've never done 'full face'. That said however, I've been told quite a lot that my walk is sexy, that I'm very feminine, graceful, whatever. Very often actually, now that I think about it, and by both men and women. Given that, I would say it was ultimately unconciously learned behavior. I suppose I notice when other women are elegant in their demeanor, and I admire that, so I must have picked up some movements that way. Weird. I'm also one of those people that can't help but mimic some behavior I observe in others, at least for a short while. I pick up accents very quickly and have caught myself copying facial expressions and hand movements. All unconciously."

And when I'm trying to command attention or feel brave I very much adopt/mimic my mother's voice to give myself a boost.  I imagine, though, that there are some physiological things that are unique to biologically female bodies, like the postures we adopt to get around when pregnant or the way we lift with our different center of balance. I imagine those aren't just culturally feminine motions."

FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,kittyminky,2,Mon Mar 23 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"Being ""feminine"" was always something I put on. I remember my sister trying to teach me how to walk ""like a girl"" when I was not even 10 years old. When I was a bit older I got really interested in being ultra-feminine: heels all the time, makeup everyday, hair always done, flirting, hip sashaying. A few years ago it suddenly became very tiresome for me and I stopped. I still love dresses and I do my darndest to sit up straight but the swishy hips and the high heels are just not natural for me."
FemmeThoughts,2zyzrl,Wombat2012,2,Mon Mar 23 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly I've never really thought about it much. My parents were never really pushy with the gender roles, and I'm sure as a young teenager I was influenced by my peers, but as an adult I feel like to some degree it comes naturally to me. I give full credit for this to the pole dancing classes I've been taking for the past 3 years - really has gotten me in touch with my body and movement etc. I feel a lot less spindly and awkward now, lol, but that has more to do with muscle control. My voice is naturally quite feminine (at least I think so?) and I do like typically ""feminine"" things such as makeup, fashion, etc, but I'm not over the top with it either.

So I did what any teenage girl would do (I think): I practiced walking in high heels, how to stand, how to lean, how to look, how to bite my lips - you name it, I've probably done it.   I've practiced ""being feminine"" so much that I've become inherently sexual. I'm not a ""lady"" feminine, I'm the ""Every guy turns their head at me when I walk in a room"" feminine.

You're right, relationships are a two way street and you both have to keep communication going. However, avoiding talking to him because he cant take you seriously is just so bad for both of you.

FemmeThoughts,2zriu2,Faydre,3,Mon Mar 23 21:07:57 2015 UTC,"I understand that. I go through it with my boyfriend of 6 years as well and it's tough. I read that you two have been best friends since you were 14. So have we! So it's incredibly tough to just cut someone like that out of your life for something like this. I always feel like even if I did decide I couldn't deal with his unintentional sexism anymore, that it'd be really tough to find another guy who doesn't have those underlying biases, so I figure I just stick with the person who is my soulmate in every other way.  They were raised in the same society we were, just on the other end of it. It's not an excuse for them to not try to change, but it can give some insight as to why it might be so hard for them to change or even realize those ways.  I try to work on it with my boyfriend, but it's tough because I have to keep the discussion related only to our isolated situation. Like, I can't bring up the fact that the things he does or says are part of this broader societal problem because then it will be automatically dismissed, because apparently sexism doesn't exist and feminism is a bad word."
FemmeThoughts,2zriu2,fatlittleparasite,38,Sat Mar 21 06:34:11 2015 UTC,"There's some really interesting sociolinguistic research on this; particularly research on gendered discourses, which are sets of attitudes and norms that operate within any social group that conceptualise gender in hegemonic, male-dominated or gender-divided ways. For example, we have the objectivity/emotionality discourse, which positions men as logical, and rational, and objective, whilst positioning women as illogical and emotional. As a result, in any discourse between a man and a woman where this gendered discourse is in play, women are at a massive disadvantage because they have to contest the the belief that they are emotional, whilst men are rational.  Thanks for this article, it makes a hugely important point. You see this all the time, every time a woman talks about discrimination/harassment she faces, she is inevitably drowned out by men screaming for ""proof"" in a way you just don't get when men talk about their experiences. It's particularly prevalent when it comes to rape; one of the most depressing things about browsing Reddit threads where rape is being discussed is seeing how many comments accuse women of making it up, and lying, and demanding unrealistic standards of proof - yet, men who offer stories along the lines of, ""my buddy totally had consensual sex with a feeeeeeeeemale and in the morning she just accused him of rape out of nowhere!"" are accepted and upvoted without question - no one demands proof that his friend had actually secured that consent. Ugh."
FemmeThoughts,2zriu2,Fairleee,30,Mon Mar 23 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"When I went off to college at 18 I considered myself a firm feminist. But while I felt sympathy when I read and listened to the shitty experiences of sexism other women went through, outside of body-image related things I saw few parallels in my own life. There was often a tinge of bitterness and exhaustion that I didn't understand (and, sometimes, privately felt was unwarranted). And I definitely did not understand the ""Women in [blank]"" that aimed to group all the women who did [blank] together. That seems so awkward, I'd think. Do we just sit around and talk about being women? Because if it's just related to [blank], I'm missing out on half the population that does it!  Over a decade of independent adulthood later and boy, do things change. You're start out shocked by the obvious sexism, but at least it's there. It's obvious. You start seeing the not-obvious stuff and that gets you paranoid. Is it me? Or is it because I'm a woman? And by the time the reality of the really not obvious stuff sets in you're getting the death by a thousand cuts. You go days without incident and then BAM you're called a cunt. Or someone asks a question, and you answer, and they smile, nod, then approach your less-experienced male colleague to repeat it then listen intensely to his advice. Or the guy at lunch who makes the ""Women, so crazy, amirite?"" joke to the rest of the table.  I have many guy friends, but getting older has brought a closeness between me and my fembros that I hadn't expected yet treasure deeply. It has brought an appreciation for these groups aimed towards supporting women, because you know when you walk into the room the other people there have gone through some version of the shit you have. You don't go to sit around and bitch about sexism, like my younger self imagined. You go to have a good time meeting people and share your career or hobby or whatever. But\ the big giant bonus is that if you do offer a feeling or opinion or idea, there's no mental preparation to provide extensive proof and credentials to any lurking sea lions.  So . . . it is nice to read something by a dude who has realized this happens."

I work in a small team on a certain project - right now it's just me, one other woman, and the project manager, plus sometimes a resource from another department who stays mostly separate. The PM has been trying to manage myself and the other woman more and more, and it is coming through as ""emotional management"". If either of us bring up a question or concern or problem, he focuses his attention on dealing with our emotions about the problem, not the problem itself. It's not only immensely frustrating, it's stalling project progress quite a bit. He's far newer to both the project and the company than either of us, so half of the concerns we bring up are situations where his intended methods have already been tried and rejected for good reasons. But he won't listen or hear that part. He doesn't trust our experience or our judgment, and assumes any problems we bring up must be because we're having some kind of emotional response.

When his wife's response to something is at an 8, he automatically assumes it's only worth a 6. But if she's like me, or a lot of women I know, that 8 is already downplaying things.

If you both have good track records at the company, and he doesn't, and is newer, who are they likely to back if things go badly?

The project manager has been doing a little pushing in that area, too, so I'm planning to bring it all up at once, during our next one-on-one.    Is this a case where he's only going to hang himself, or will you two get screwed over?   I'm not totally sure, but she and I are both only committing a certain percentage of our time to this project, whereas it's his whole job. There's a certain amount of built-in protection from that, and she's made sure to make herself valuable - indispensable, actually - outside of this project. I'm working on following her lead on that front. Also, he's definitely the one running the show, so you'd think the consequences for decisions going south would be on him. She said she wants to speak with her manager about it, too, in case it does come to that, but as I said, her management structure is a little fuzzy at the moment."

I'm not saying it's true or anything, but I wonder how much that plays into things.  On one hand, bullshit stereotypes are bullshit. People of all genders talk for a million reasons.   But I do wonder... Occasionally someone taking me at my word is all I need. And when I'm surrounded by a world that makes me even doubt my own observations at times it is validating to have someone there who doesn't immediately dismiss things. So I'm half-wondering if that stereotype didn't come from something.  I can tell the difference in myself when I'm talking primarily with men or women. With men I feel as though I need sources immediately. (It's kind of why I love having a smartphone. I can now pull shit out to prove I know what I'm talking about. Even though it's crap I have to do it at all.) But with my lady friends we can just say ""this happened"" and there's at least a basic layer of trust there that that thing actually happened. Or I can mostly trust that if I ask a woman ""am I overreacting?"" that she'll generally give me the benefit of the doubt or has a better idea of whether I am or not."

They are just normal women, not famous, but the movie is about them.  Apparently this is a teen movie, but I also recently watched 'How I Live Now'   and I really enjoyed it.

Her character has some serious issues, but god damn is she a cold-hearted, fearless badass. Gillian Anderson plays a lot of characters like that (Scully from X-Files was a huge role model to me growing up). Star Trek: Voyager (not sure if it's on netflix) has Captain Janeway, the only female captain in the Trek franchise. She is totally awesome and very powerful. Even if you're not into Sci-Fi, the Star Trek universe has loads of awesome female characters."

But all the main characters on that show are deeply flawed people. A big question with Stella is whether we're judging her for her behaviours because she's female, i.e. would we think something is ""wrong"" with a man for acting exactly the same way. Her sexual activity, for example, is probably something that wouldn't be widely seen as a big deal if she were a man. But there are some things about her that would raise some red flags for me regardless of gender.  She seems to have some serious family-of-origin issues, and perhaps an unhealthy level of anger that seethes below the surface. She seems to have a disdain for men, which might seem ""normal"" if she were a man feeling that way toward women, but isn't very healthy and prosocial any way you slice it. After season 1, I wondered if she maybe didn't have some Antisocial Personality Disorder tendencies, but after season 2 I doubt that. Her reluctance to emote or form any close long-term attachments could be a sign of emotional problems, or it could be a result of her profession...perhaps she is overcompensating for prejudices that exist toward women in the police force by outwardly seeming so strong. She is much stronger than the men around her, but at the same time she does have human vulnerabilities that she seems to be trying desperately to bury at all costs. I don't feel like all of her behaviours are particularly healthy, but even after two seasons we just don't know her well enough. We know the antagonist and his motivations much better than we know Stella. She seems rather cold--not just cold ""for a woman,"" but in general. She seems to be hiding herself even from the tv audience, going far beyong just being a private person who keeps work separate from their inner life. I hope we get to learn more about her in future seasons; she's absolutely fascinating. I rarely see female characters that are so intriguing, layered, and genuinely badass."

The first two movies are definitely good, the third one, again still on the character perspective is awesome.  Just keep a bit of skepticism in your pocket on the whole Anti-Statist view the author injects because whenever you get that anti-authoritarian rhetoric, if not backed up with anti-capitalism, it starts to smell a lot like market libertarianism. Still, I'm being perhaps a bit unfair as the movie at that stage (who knows how the 4th one will deal with it) keeps the plans for the post-revolutionary period deliberately vague.

Do I want to read this now, at this moment? Would I rather read this later, when I am better prepared, or not rushing through my day? Would I rather save this for the future? Do I want to skip this entirely?""  Trigger warnings are an incredibly limited tool. They cannot keep someone safe from all triggers for their PTSD. Only a very specific few, in specific formats, in certain circles. And people who wildly misuse trigger warnings, putting them on anything that might be slightly offensive or upsetting (ie Dan Savage), or who don't bother to clearly explain what the warning is for, absolutely weaken this already limited tool. (Small mod reminder btw that we recently updated and clarified our trigger and content warning policy in order to help tackle this issue).  But when used properly, warnings can be an effective tool.

FemmeThoughts,2zmxb1,filologo,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:39:25 2015 UTC,"On that Reed student who got kicked out of class...When the libertarian/conservative Reason Magazine’s Robby Soave (who knew this professor as an ardent defender of free speech) reached out to the student for his side of the story, he wrote: “Before I interview with you, you must agree to make “nigger” be the first word in your article.”  Sounds like  a swell guy.   http://www.mediaite.com/online/this-story-about-reed-college-kid-banned-for-challenging-rape-stats-just-got-really-weird/  The Reed Quest, a student paper, dug into True’s allegations and spoke to several people in his class, who told them that True’s behavior had crossed the line from contrarianism to…we don’t even know:   According to Savery, True had made other unsettling contributions to the conference this semester, including a comment about Theocritus that “lower class people didn’t have the ability to create art” and a comment about how “we shouldn’t blame the people who were responsible for the Holocaust… because they didn’t know any better.”  Maude-Griffin says that True’s behavior started out only “a little bit patronizing” and then escalated from there over the course of the semester."
FemmeThoughts,2zmxb1,neschastye,3,Fri Mar 20 22:49:38 2015 UTC,"“Reedies have forgotten what student activism actually is,” he says. “Student activism can fuck a place up. I have sent the faculty and student services scrambling for cover. It’s been an enormous amount of fun.”  “This is the most fun I’ve had all year,” True continued, “and I have not this much fun since I was a kid. It’s so liberating.”  At the end of his petition, he wrote a haunting statement of his determination:  “No matter what happens. I love you, mom. I love you, dad. I love you my dear, dear sisters. I love you my dearest friends. I love you all, and I will sacrifice everything for you. … I do not want to be a martyr, but I will do that if that is what is necessary to make a statement.”   So I thought this was all a bit funny and sad earlier, but I'm changing my mind. That quote is a bit terrifying.   Look, lots of people are absolute arseholes and racist and sexist and whatnot. And some of those people even disturb their classes enough to get kicked out. But that he found that fun, and that he sees himself as self-sacrificing and being turned into a martyr....that's scary. This guy needs help. Like, a lot of it.   He sees himself as a victim, a liberator and potential martyr. He dehumanises and objectifies whole swathes of humanity, and has no problem justifying the most extreme levels of violence. That young man looks like a fucking powder keg.   EDIT: Oh dear lord, and he just wrote this weird mini-manifesto: link"

FemmeThoughts,2zmxb1,Seldarin,26,Thu Mar 19 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"While that seems like a good idea in theory, in practice it's probably a good way to bring on waves of non-stop evo-psychish arguments in every class ever.  ""Have you considered that rape is an adaptation meant to prevent the species from dying out?"" ""Dude, no one gives a fuck what you think. I'm trying to teach Calculus up here."" ""Why do you not respond to my well reasoned argument? Do you admit I'm right?!"" etc  Giving the 2edgy4me idiots a captive audience would guarantee you'd never be able to teach or discuss anything else.

FemmeThoughts,2zmxb1,lockedge,16,Fri Mar 20 00:24:36 2015 UTC,"Didn't this guy get increasingly hostile over the span of the semester, and demand apologies from the women in his class after a whole swath of students (not just women ) said they were uncomfortable with his classist statements, his defense of those involved in the holocaust, his defense of racism, etc. etc. ?  It seems as if this guy was not trying to stir up intellectual discussion, but position himself in a position of authority on matters, and that...in a first year class that's supposed to get students used to the post-secondary environment and used to discussion at that level...is certainly worthy of censorship, given it's not done in good faith, and he was continually disrupting class (taking up a whole 50 minutes of class one time, likely derailing it).  They tolerated him early on...hell, they cut him a lot of slack to only kick him out now, from what I understand. He routinely showed that he was not interested in allowing the learning environment to go without disruption. There IS a value in exposing students to numerous new ideas. There is no value when it nullifies all gains in the learning environment and makes the student body feel unsafe and distracted."
FemmeThoughts,2zmxb1,firefawkes23,9,Fri Mar 20 01:46:31 2015 UTC,"Is it really a good thing to eliminate the conflict and just have a room full of uniformity, even at the expense of mild distress (not including PTSD)?    If you read through the article, it seems like his dissention was originally welcomed, and then got more aggressive when someone expressed discomfort to him. Other students were speaking to him personally, outside of class, about his words, and felt that his response escalated to the point of plain harassment. I think there's a difference between ""eliminating conflict"" and ""having boundaries for conflict in the classroom"".   I think of the classroom as a mental space where people can try out different ideas and be somewhat removed from them, seeing how they play out. Yet at the same time including a dialogue of experience (such as the derision to those ideas).   I agree, but if other students are being made less able to use the classroom as that mental space because of one student's escalating aggression, it doesn't seem unreasonable to set boundaries for that student and remove him if he does not cooperate."

I've got a feeling his cries of freezepeach would've ended in a hurry the second a ""race realist"" showed up and started arguing he was an inferior person, or not a person at all. If we're going to open the floodgates to ""Rape doesn't real"" people, we're going to have to open them to race realists and Hitler did nothing wrong and the J00z did 9/11ers. Now we can't have a discussion on Descartes because we're too busy fighting with some idiot that thinks shadows mean the moon landing were faked. I've met plenty of people that hold advanced degrees that are crazier than a sack full of wet cats, so restricting it to graduate students might help, but not a lot.  I actually enjoy discussions that push my comfort zone, but I don't think I'd enjoy spending tens of thousands of dollars a year of borrowed money to let someone get his jollies by doing it. I could see maybe having an elective class the kids didn't have to show up to once a week or once a month where they could advance ideas no matter how controversial. I'd certainly enjoy something like that. But giving people a regular soapbox in the middle of time a bunch of other people are paying a lot of money for is just going to further traumatize people with PTSD and piss off everyone that doesn't have it."

And why do you think that without him in class there will be a ""roomful of uniformity""? Why do you believe that he's being kicked out of the class for causing ""mild distress""?  If all of the students agreed that he was disruptive, that doesn't mean that they all agree on everything. Rather, that's generally a good indication that people of different backgrounds and opinions recognise him as a disruptive arsehole.  He's crying censorship and oppression. But nothing seems to actually support those claims. I find out disturbing that you're swallowing wholeheartedly whatever he says and ignoring everyone else who is saying the opposite."
FemmeThoughts,2zmxb1,kitcat_kittycat,3,Fri Mar 20 11:53:01 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you're trying to find a middle ground between censorship and hurt feelings as a way to analyse how intellectual discussion can negatively affect personal well being? Okay, well, now that you've clarified, I'm removing your comments for being wildly inappropriate.   You're hugely derailing a conversation by a) talking about something fairly abstract and unrelated to the specific issue at hand, and b) by falsely equating that actual issue as one of censorship vs. hurt feelings. If you'd like to start a discussion about how damaging ideas and opinions can negatively affect personal well being in academic situations, feel free to do that in your own post, if you can do it without false equivalences, anti-feminism, misrepresenting feminism or other rule violations.   It's actually a topic that's discussed a lot, and been studied a fair amount. There's a lot of coverage of it in academic feminism. Though the only people I know who treat this issue as a competition between censorship and feelings are generally hugely anti-feminist and racist and so on.   While you often make good contributions here, you've also had more than a little difficulty with our rules. I'd strongly advise you to review our subreddit rules and take more care when commenting here in the future.    If you have any questions or concerns, please message the moderators. Direct replies to official mod comments may be removed for further derailing. Thanks!"

However, not all opinions carry equal weight. I can respect that someone is entitled to the opinion that global climate change is not driven by human actions while at the same time not respecting the opinion itself. I can respect the need for some issues to be argued from both sides while acknowledging that for other issues it is completely inappropriate.   This is one of those times where it is completely inappropriate. To say that we live in a society that ""hates rape"" is ignorant and hurtful, when you consider how few rape victims report their attacks, when you consider how few reported rapes actually end in successful prosecution of the rapist, when you consider the continuing stigma rape victims all along the gender spectrum face, when you consider the widespread idea that rape in prison is justified against certain classes of offenders, when you consider the bias against all victims who aren't ""perfect"" because they may be promiscuous or may have initially consented to the encounter or who may have a history of sexual encounters with the accused rapist...  I'm not saying that there shouldn't be frank discussions (or even debates) about rape culture, or the nature of consent, or how statistics about rapes and sexual assault are kept. What I am saying is that in order for those discussions to be productive, both parties have to accept certain basic premises, and the student in question seemed far more interested in being contrary and voicing his opinion than in having productive conversations."

The professor in question is apparently out spoken in his support of free speech and debate, it's a basic humanities survey course, the ""offence"" apparently took place during an open discussion section of the course, and (as I heard it) consisted of the student pointing out that the oft-quoted statistic than 1-in-5 women at college will be raped is misleading (which it is, although for reasons which might be a bit nuanced for an undergraduate class...)  So you know, banning him seemed a bit strong.  Then I ran across this absolutely fascinating story about the issue on Reason.  Let me quote the conclusion (warning, uses some very bad language):   ""He was not banned because of what he said but because of a series of disruptive behaviors,"" Savery told Reason.  I also reached True via email, and asked him whether he had been rowdy or disruptive in class. He responded by making a bizarre request. This was his email back to me:  Before I interview with you, you must agree to make ""nigger"" be the first word in your article.  I declined this ultimatum, and he declined to answer my questions. Needless to say, I've grown a lot more skeptical of True's side of the story. If I find out anything more that backs up either person's assertions about what happened, I'll update this story.

Things I don’t know if I can hear one more time, though not necessarily directly related to Kappa Delta Rho:  “Those jerks!

They don’t even wear coats, and they dress that way to get in!”  “The media loves to hate on Penn State.”  “Has anybody shared the photos? I hate to be a voyeur, but it's also intriguing to see them and how bad they are.”  “You have to be really, really dumb to photograph that stuff. You have to be even dumber to post those photos on Facebook, where you no longer control them.

I would still like to receive important messages, just not these.”- PSU staff member in response to university-wide timely warning alert about indecent assault.

FemmeThoughts,2zjgkh,nursing_throw,2,Thu Mar 19 19:52:41 2015 UTC,"Apologize for the throwaway, but I don’t like potential identifying information tied to my main account.    I was talking to our hr manager and our nursing manager responsible for hiring nurses about this.   I was told that men are underrepresented in nursing and in demand due to the increasing weight of our patients.  The average man is better equipped to deal with the 350 pound patient than the average woman.  That is combined with a staff shortage (hospitals are cutting back on nursing assistants who could help nurses lift such patients) and makes it necessary to hire more people strong enough to take these heavy patients by themselves.  They often offer men more during salary negotiations to attract them.  I was also told that men are more likely to counter-offer during negotiations as well compared to women, contributing to the pay gap as well.   Additionally, and partially due to strength, men tend to be placed in the higher paying areas (like ER, ICU) where they may be needed to quickly lift these heavy patients.    That being said, the F/M ratio on our floor is roughly 65/35.  I wonder if the pay difference is even higher now (to explain the glut of men) or leveling off (as men become more represented)."

It's not as if it's a contest, or as if there is a quota for there being enough representation of certain groups. These are jobs that can be done by anyone, so someone put a picture up that they felt represented their view. Other people might have a different view and there's no problem with that, but that difference doesn't necessitate change."

Rinaldi can't have kids with her spouse, so she decides the alternative path to life fulfillment with family is to instead fulfill it with brief flings with strangers? I mean, plenty of women can't have kids who really want to, and they don't decide to cheat on their partner to fill that hole in their life. To me this seems more like the story of a woman who is unhappy in her marriage and clung to ""he doesn't want kids"" as the justification for her actions. Rinaldi ran from her problems and slept with strangers, destroying her marriage in the process. She and her spouse should have worked through this issue, even if it inevitably meant separation. Honestly, I feel really bad for the husband."

And she seems to think that can only come in one of two ways: a child or lots of sex with lots of people.  I have no issue with anyone who discovers that monogamy doesn't work for them, or who feels sexually unfulfilled and wants more. But that's not her story. Her story is of a woman who when hurting, didn't know how to respond except to hurt in return. I do feel for anyone who is that lost. But that doesn't mean she or her writing is above criticism. She acted selfishly and dangerously. And her view of life and herself seems myopic at best. It's almost as though unsatisfied with her success/performance when viewed by one particular type of male gaze she runs out to try every other male gaze and see if she can find success there. It's pretty sad."

FemmeThoughts,2zekxq,PinkOrchidFan,19,Tue Mar 17 22:54:57 2015 UTC,"What I found really depressing was the Facebook conversation. It was yet again, another one of those issues where the initial offence wasn't that terrible, but the defence of it was beyond gross.  If your response to having your work criticised by feminists to insult, belittle and invalidate women, and cry about the PC police and censorship, then there's a real problem. And even if I didn't necessarily agree with the original critique, you're going to get a tonne of side-eye from me based on how you respond.  I found the original image eh. It was tired and cliche. It represented a woman with zero agency, and implied that she was to blame for the misogyny she faced. It was 100% male gaze.  But the reaction the that criticism. Holy fuck, that's incredibly stomach churning.  It's like a corollary to Lewis' Law. This always happens. Always."

Think Jennifer Lawrence. It reminds me a lot of that quote from Gone Girl:   “Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.    Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)”  ― Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl   I think there's a beauty in wearing a princess dress while playing soccer.

FemmeThoughts,2z6cn6,sillandria,5,Mon Mar 16 00:18:43 2015 UTC,"I feel desperate, anxious, and depressed a lot I dont know why - it isn't a specific kind of feeling .    Depression never really is. The worst part about depression is how difficult it can be to put into words. Emotions can be complex and often times beyond our rational understanding, which can infuriate us, especially those that like to have control over themselves. I have anxiety about being in social groups related to my upbringing, depression stemming from low self-esteem and gender dysphoria, and my worst moments come when I get frustrated by those around me for doing things that I know aren't big deals, but for whatever reason they get on my nerves and I snap at them.   What is worse, like you I don't have I support network IRL since most of my ""friends"" abandoned my after High School. How I continue to live is through good friends online that I can talk to about anything and I have been getting into Wicca which is helping me keep myself sane amongst all the philosophical nihilism that I am prone to. There is also the hope that I will be able to finally get a job one day and get a job for fuck's sake. I can empathize with your mother, finding a job is difficult, especially for someone older. Applying for them can vary from a minute to over an hour, depending on what kinda bullshit they want you to go through.    There is so much clutter that I dont even have time to begin cleaning it so I feel powerless.   The worse part about clutter is that it will always look like clutter until it is all clean. Getting down to cleaning it can be annoying since it never seems like you are getting anywhere. But remember: cleaning clutter is always a long game. You have to take it little by little, piece by piece, in order to get rid of it. Think of it as akin to growing your hair. It happens ever day, but you never notice it. Just know that even if you think that it isn't getting better, so long as you are persistent it will get clean . . . eventually.   I wish i had a support network where we could help each other get better.   We could always start something here. I am sure there are plenty of people like you that would benefit from something like this."

FemmeThoughts,2z6cn6,coreythestar,5,Tue Mar 17 23:25:10 2015 UTC,"First of all, you can't change or fix your family. You can be as positive and supportive as you can be, but you have to know that the rest is up to them. Spending a lot of energy trying to fix other people, only to see nothing change, is so draining. Right now, you need to focus on you. You can support your family when they take steps to help themselves.  My support network is mostly not family. I love my family, and there are times when I turn to specific members of my family for specific kinds of support or advice, but most of the time, when I need general support, I turn to other people.   So, how do you go about forming those connections? I'm lucky that a lot of the people who make up my support network have been in my life for at least five years. My friends from high school, friends and professors from college, people like that. Those were people that I met through structures that are designed to help you meet people. So, my first piece of advice for building up a support network (outside of your family), is to go out and meet more people. I know that's easier said than done, especially when you are depressed and anxious and need support now.  Something like MeetUp can help you find activities you'll enjoy, which might help with getting yourself out there. And with something like MeetUp, you'll be interacting with people who want more social interaction too. If you think you click with someone, see if they want to grab lunch or coffee sometime. Support can be as simple as having someone in your life that is more positive, and can help balance out some of your family's negativity.   Sometimes you need more active support, and that's the kind that can take a little bit longer to cultivate. It takes time, but it is so worth it. Right now, when you're anxious and depressed it might seem like too much energy, but think of it as an investment in your future well-being. And remember, support goes two ways; figure out what works for you, how you can support other people and not have it drain you. People will be more willing to be part of your support system when you are a part of theirs.   As for your family, if you're like me, even if you know intellectually that they have to help themselves, you still want to do something. I can't get my family (mother, father, and sister) to all be in the same room together, so I haven't been able to try this out with them, but I think gaming could be really positive in helping families like ours. I think collaborative tabletop games would be a great place to start, things like Pandemic, or a collaborative/competitive mix like Resistance or Betrayal at House on a Hill would be a great way to introduce new, positive dynamics into families that have gotten into a rut.   Framing it this way has really helped me let go of trying to fix my family. I'm convinced that if my mom, dad, sister, and I all sit down and play one of these games, we could actually have fun. I can't remember the last time we had fun together, which is why I think gaming would be a great step forward. But I can't force them to come to the table, that's up to them. Thinking about introducing gaming to my family gives me hope, but it also reminds me of just how far my influence extends. In the mean time, I play games with my friends, my support network."

FemmeThoughts,2z2cay,The_Truth_Fairy,12,Sun Mar 15 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"So what do we (or I, as a woman) do about it?   My partner is fantastic, and usually chalks up 50% of the housework, but we have no children yet. I have to find a new job yet I'm approaching 30 and employers will be looking at me as if I'll soon be a mother, not a good employee. How do I fight to be taken as equal to my partner, and ensure that when the time comes and we have children, I'm not the one sacrificing my career?"
FemmeThoughts,2z2cay,bluntbangs,10,Sun Mar 15 09:27:54 2015 UTC,"So what do we (or I, as a woman) do about it?   On the ‘we’ front 1. Campaign for Norwegian-style parental leave policies that include ‘a non-transferable “use it or lose it” period of paid parental leave’ for the non-child-bearing partner.  The personal benefits of such leave entirely aside, this state-mandated approach has the happy side-effect of turning ‘taking time off to care for youngsters’ into a universal social norm. If everyone takes parental leave, it stops being a black mark on child-bearing parents in the work-force. (Working from semi-vague memory, I believe the opposite is now the case in Norway: men who don’t take parental leave are looked upon as bad fathers rather than good workers.)  On the ‘we’ front 2. Campaign against neo-liberal economics, in all its guises.  The perverse notion that social structures and systems exist to support economic goals, rather than the other way round, is at the heart of almost all the attacks on the socially-oriented policies that improve the lot of people who aren’t straight, White and male.  On the ‘I’ front 1. Take a leaf out of the ‘not in a heteronormative pair-bond’ book.  Same-sex couples, almost by definition, can’t fall into heteronormative household patterns because the genders in the pair-bond don’t match the default imposed by compulsory heterosexuality.  My partner and I don’t have formal- or gender-based divisions. Instead we have shared responsibility. For the most part we don’t divide the household labour, we do it together. Or, at worst, we do it for each other.  There’s another useful consequence of this: we do what needs to be done when it needs to be done and without much need for discussion or negotiation. When I was spending my days in an office in the city I rose and showered first. As a consequence my partner made the bed each morning and prepared breakfast. Now that I’m back to working out of my home office, my partner rises and showers first. And I’m now the one who makes both the bed and breakfast.  This sort of duty switching and the more general duty sharing is second-nature to us. And it’s not second-nature just because we had to consciously question the heternormative default and re-negotiate our roles as a couple. It’s second-nature because it never occurred to either of us to run our intimate and domestic lives any other way.  On the ‘I’ front 2. Don’t live in 1950s-style, socially-isolated, nuclear family structures.  Which is not to say I’m arguing for communes.  My partner and I live in our own dwelling and we did so when we were raising our children. Day-to-day, however, we spent much of our household time floating between our house, the house of the family we shared a back-fence with (to the extent we put a gate in said fence), the houses of the courtesy Aunts and Uncles that constituted our meyased zayn mishpochah (found family), and the house of my partner’s oldest childhood friend (half-a-block away).  The children in the family we shared a back-fence with were about the same age as our two, as were the children of my partner’s childhood friend. This informal kin group meant we had half-a-dozen and more people to call on to deal with the array of things that happen despite (and, occasionally, because of) your planning.  All the way through primary school and high school, for example, I was a freelancer working from my home office. As a consequence, I was also the one who took the kids to school and picked them up from school and did the various after-school runs or brought the kids straight home. And by ‘kids’ I mean all six kids that constituted our informal kin group. Which freed the other five parents in said group to work at their more tied-to-a-place-and-set-times jobs without hassle or concern. And, on the rare occasions where my own work got in the way, we had older Aunts and Uncles to take up the slack.  Practical benefits aside, and acknowledging I can only speculate with regards what we didn’t do, being parent to two and allo-parent to four was absolutely the best thing I’ve ever done. Messy and chaotic and noisy and busy as hell and occasionally scary as hell. But so much better than any other way I can think of to have lived my life."

I know he works hard, and I work hard too. We both want the same thing (a good fulfilling life outside the home, and time to relax at home), so chores and housework often get neglected unless I do it or nag him.

This may be a rare act of social responsibility.    For folk unsure about whether 'vulva' has ever been spoken outside of a medical university the following may help:    Here's the authority on current usage by the young and ignorant, written and voted on by anybody: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vulva    Google image search ""vulva diagram"", then hover your mouse over a few of the zillions of images to verify that they are on websites created for the general public.    Now search ""vagina diagram"".   Notice that again there are a zillion diagrams, but none of them label the vulva as being included in the vagina.    I wonder if all this fuss started about when US TV was starting to allow ""vagina"" outside of medical programs.  We had the vajayjay incident on Opra, and suddenly everybody wanted to show how grown-up they were by saying vagina at every opportunity.

I don't want to call them outdated, but it seems untamed by today's online culture.  That can be a good thing and a bad thing, but certainly it makes her work prickly.    I only really want to pick her on one statement: “It’s moved along for the gay community, for the African-American community, but women are still just trading on their ass. To me, the last great frontier is women.” Of course, there are a multitude of reasons to find this troubling, but what I'd like to impress most is that the comparing of struggles between different oppressed groups isn't productive.

What my supervisor suggested is simply getting to know people. So, for what I do, that requires going to seminars and conferences and sitting with people I don't know at coffee or lunch and asking them about their research and them asking me about mine. If you have a way to connect professionally, such as LinkedIn you can give them your username. And if they're really interested you can give them a card with your name and email and number. That is my limited understanding at this point: make some friends from different places with different skills and advertise your own skills and expertise."
FemmeThoughts,2ys39e,trainofthought700,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:53:53 2015 UTC,hmm that kinda makes sense!
FemmeThoughts,2ys39e,slothcough,6,Sat Mar 14 04:02:41 2015 UTC,"Basically, make friends. It's not always easy at first, but it gets easier as you do it. When at work or professional environments, talk to people, and ask them about themselves- people love talking about their work. This might mean sitting with people you don't know at lunch to get to know them, or calling up someone you met and asking them out for coffee to get some career advice. People also love feeling like someone thinks they're important enough to garner asking them for advice. Bond like you would with other friends, over their non-professional interests like TV, games, etc.   I don't know your field, but mine is film. This still applies whenever possible: never miss a party. You make big connections after work, not always at work. You prove your competence at work, you build your network in the after-hours with people who see you as competent. Go out for drinks with the boss or your coworkers, conference goers, etc. Find new people you hit it off with on LinkedIn a couple days after and reach out, so they still remember you. My industry uses fb more than LinkedIn so I do that instead.  Good luck! Networking is not always a simple thing- it's an organic process just like any other social interaction. I didn't notice my network had started finally working for me until I looked back on the last two years and realised that every single gig I'd had was from a network referral, not an application."
FemmeThoughts,2ys39e,frackaracka,1 point,Thu Mar 12 13:11:45 2015 UTC,I'm heading to film school soon and I was wondering how to go about building a network. Do you have any particular advice for networking as a student?
FemmeThoughts,2ys39e,slothcough,4,Thu Mar 12 16:05:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely. Two things: firstly, make friends with your classmates and always keep in the loop on who is developing what, what kind of help they need, etc. You might not like all your classmates (I sure didn't...some were pretentious as shit!) but find the people who you click with and work with them as much as you can. Be friendly, work hard, and try your best to find a balance between high standards and not coming off as too high maintenance on set. That's a harder balance for women in film than it is for men, unfortunately, because of how people perceive us as opposed to men.  But most importantly, there will be times to network with your teachers- these are people who are generally still actively working in the field. Find some common ground with them and see if you already know someone in the industry that they know, too. Film folks will open up a TON the minute they find out you know someone they've worked with/are friends with. There will be other film industry professionals who might come in to teach workshops, and those are the people who might most be willing to give you a hand if they like you. Join them for lunch during the workshop, connect with them after on fb or by email if you feel like you guys hit it off. Ask them what they've got lined up and make it clear that you have a great work ethic and zero ego. It's students like that that I will remember and perhaps call them for a PA gig if I have one available. That's what happened to me when I first started- an AD on set found me and really liked me. Over time he asked me to help volunteer on a few free shoots in the camera dept (I'm an AC) and helped me meet a ton of people. Film people always have small side projects going on and these are a great way to prove yourself on set and meet other people to network with. That being said, you need to pick and choose your free jobs. Volunteer gigs offered by random people on Craigslist with the potential for networking? Hell no. Volunteer gig with a union AD who's got his camera union friend as the director of photography? Worth it.  Sorry for the wall of text!"

FemmeThoughts,2ys39e,twistedfork,2,Thu Mar 12 14:05:47 2015 UTC,"To add to this, become an active member of an association related to your profession.  You get a lot of exposure this way.

FemmeThoughts,2ys39e,sublevelcaver,2,Sat Mar 14 04:28:30 2015 UTC,"No. You get their card during dinner and drinks. Then after the conference/event, you email them a follow-up question based on something you talked about over drinks (preferably related to your industry.) You're now in their address book, and they're now in yours. You can do the LinkedIn thing after that, but an email conversation is going to make a bigger impact on them remembering you at a later date."
FemmeThoughts,2ys39e,wildeaboutoscar,1 point,Sat Mar 14 05:12:06 2015 UTC,so that's it? people will recommend you for a position just based on a meeting at a mixer and a few emails?
FemmeThoughts,2ys39e,TIGit,2,Sat Mar 14 05:55:53 2015 UTC,"They won't straight up recommend you (that will only come from people you've actually worked with in school or at another position) but they will consider you. Dinner and drinks is your opportunity to hint that you're competent in your field and that you're pleasant to be around. If they get a giant stack of resumes and have to narrow it down to five or ten to actually interview, it helps to know that, ""Oh, I remember sublevelcaver from when we discussed haul truck automation software at the SME conference. She didn't seem like a total dumbass, and she didn't come off as a drag to work with. Let's put her in the maybe pile."" Now you probably get and interview and a chance to prove yourself.   Networking isn't magic. Anyone who just lends their recommendation to someone they met for an hour at a conference or dinner is going to lose the credibility behind future recommendations if the new hire isn't very good, hence why straight-up recs are reserved for people your actually know, not just networked with.   I guess you could think of networking as having two tiers. You expand your tier one (dinner and drinks networking) in order to gain opportunities to work more closely with people. And once you've gained their respect, then that relationship enters your second, higher tier. That tier is more valuable, but will only exist and expand if you keep working at the tier one stuff.   Eta: I just saw from another comment that you don't drink. I do, but I also went to school in Utah, and a good portion of my cohorts were Mormon. Drinking is pretty big in my industry, so a professor once advised the Mormon students to: A. Never make it a big deal that you don't drink. You don't have to give any reason. If you say for religious reasons, they might think that you think you're morally superior. If it's for ""health reasons"" (which has broad interpretations because it's so vague) they could think you're an insufferable health nut who is going to make them feel bad when they order shitty food. If it's court mandated, then....  Yeah. Don't want to share that. B. Order something like tonic water if you have to order in front of others who drink. It's ""fancier"" than water or soda, and even judgemental drinkers will usually leave you alone for it. Some of them don't know that tonic isn't alcoholic, as they're used to hearing it only in the context of gin and tonics.   I'm only passing that advice along, as it's not something I personally have had to deal with, so I can't speak for how useful it actually is."

FemmeThoughts,2yq7tj,ruchenn,10,Wed Mar 11 22:10:59 2015 UTC,"On a less anger-inducing note:   A leading Victorian surgeon has resigned from The Alfred hospital after multiple allegations were made by junior surgeons of sexual harassment and poor surgical decision-making.  CEO of The Alfred hospital Andrew Way has also told Fairfax Media that although the hospital has a robust complaint and surgical auditing system, he has “significant” concerns that a culture in smaller medical departments discouraged junior doctors from complaining about their superiors.  The revelations come amid a furore around harassment in the health system prompted by a senior female Sydney surgeon, who recently said that trainees who reported sexual harassment could ruin their careers.  The Alfred surgeon who resigned last week was the subject of serious complaints raised by at least seven junior surgeons and other medical staff. The case has divided The Alfred hospital and incensed the top surgeon’s supporters.  But his critics say the surgeon was for years able to get away with inappropriate personal behaviour — including frequent references to colleagues about rape and sodomy — and that his deficiencies in the operating room were tolerated due to his seniority. — ‘Top surgeon quits The Alfred hospital amid sex harassment claims’, Nick McKenzie & Richard Baker, The Age, 2015-03-11."

FemmeThoughts,2yn0ny,lez-be-honest-here,0,Wed Mar 11 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"That's not how the curriculum (currently) reads in the Catholic system in Ontario.  There's really no difference between how it's taught in both systems, except that in the Catholic system they don't go any more in depth about bc than explaining what they are and what they do, while emphasizing abstinence.  They might get into the morality of that as part of a lesson, but it's not proscribed by the Catholic curriculum to do so.    If you had lessons like that it's the result of a particular teacher teaching it that way, and potentially breaking the rules.  I also went through the Catholic system, and whether or not the way they tend to teach it is 'right' is for another argument, however the way you described it is inaccurate as a description of the way it's actually taught in most schools and by most teachers.  I know this because my wife teaches in that system as well, and as an atheist, I've discussed this with her a lot.  I've actually read the curriculum for sex ed that's taught in Ontario Catholic schools and it's not at all different from the public one.  It's still lacking, which is why the new one is so urgently needed.  The new curriculum actually deals with sexual assault, in addition to gender identity and sexual orientation, and that too will be taught in the Catholic system.  As I said, the merits of the separate school system isn't really the subject of this thread, though I hold no love for it even though my wife teaches in it, but I'd rather criticize it for things its actually guilty of, rather than the actions of a small minority of teachers within it, the kind of which you'll find in any public school as well."

As well as multiple times over the years in Religion class we had nurses come in that pushed for abstinence, but stressed that if you had more than one partner outside of marriage that you would more than likely receive an STI and/or get pregnant.

Never mind the fact that it is a simple Latinate prefix that has existed for thousands of years, and provides a useful addition to our vocabulary to distinguish between cis and trans people without othering the marginalised group.

And I get what you're saying. For instance, so many people are happy to gender their car and give it pronouns, but that effort can't be made for trans people, apparently. And so many just refuse to look up info on trans people, dysphoria, or any studies done, and end up spouting off nonsense that MIGHT have been the norm back in the 70s as well.   So many people here on reddit are ""fine/okay/supportive/etc."" of trans people in a very abstract, twisted sense. But any time trans people have to engage with them, any time their understanding of trans people or the science/sociology related to them is challenged, they get hostile.

Does the opinion that the asterisk is necessary make it right? again not necessarily.  I simply stated that these differing opinions existed, I did not say whether one was correct over the other in either direction."
FemmeThoughts,2yl7yq,sillandria,3,Wed Mar 11 09:30:08 2015 UTC,"I find the thing silly just because how would you pronounce it? The asterisk carries no real meaning behind it in this sense. If I am talking to someone I cannot use trans* since it would be cumbersome to say trans-asterisk. That and as a trans woman I am not gender queer or non-binary or what have you. Transgender as a term already has issues since it groups together non-binary and non-cisgender individuals despite them being different, by using the asterisk people are just conflating this issue even more, burying non-binary people within the wider trans identity just like trans people have for so many years been buried under the LGBT identity where advances in gay rights have often come with betraying trans rights due to the non-acceptance of trans individuals. All and all I don't want my binary privilege to blind me to the odd niche that non-binaries are being placed in when their situation is compared to mine."
FemmeThoughts,2yl7yq,AutumnLily11,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"well we don't pronounce a lot of punctuation, it's either implied or understood. To be fair the asterisk doesn't realy feature in spoken language that I'm aware of so it would be a label used mainly in political spaces where it's either already understood or can have time given to it to be explained.  In all honesty, it's a non-issue in my day to day like, if I have to tell someone I am trans that's all I say (with accompanying explanation of direction and procedure) I sometimes use it online and primarily on reddit.  I can see where issues come in, as I said before and will reiterate, I hold no opinion that the asterisk is right or it's wrong. I try not to politic, because often reddit/online politics rarely affects me day to day (if I were to be an activist i would be taking to the streets to protest or educate rather than waste my time arguing with people who have already decided I'm wrong because on the internet everyone already knows everything) but right now I am already questioning my binary status (I am still trans but I'm not quite sure if I fit entirely in the binary, though I wouldn't call myself non-binary, just unsure at the moment) but if someone who is non-binary comes and said to me ""Look, the asterisk in the Trans* label including non-binary people upsets me because I feel it erases my identity"" then I would stop and question my own use of the asterisk. Since I'm not really commited to its use already it makes it easier for me to be flexible about the issue and to defer to someone who knows more about said issue.  on the other hand like we have LGBTQ (nowish my understanding is that this wasn't always the case especially early in any social movement for equality on that front) and if a sufficient number of non-binary and non-cisgender persons are behind the trans political movement then we would need a way to describe a diverse group without offense. Maybe Trans* isn't the right way to go about it, maybe it is. I really don't feel like I'm the one to make that decision, the decisions I make only affect my life and I do tend to err on the side of caution.  Sorry for rambling, being in the middle has it's consequences i.e. making a concise arguement can be difficult /s =P"

I don't really understand the fuss behind its usage and I'll keep using it as I please.

FemmeThoughts,2yl7yq,sillandria,2,Wed Mar 11 13:52:10 2015 UTC,"the problem is, if you're non-binary and don't identify as necessarily being transgender, you are still described as trans*   In my mind, if a non-binary didn't want to be called transgender, then trans* is a terrible way of referring to them because how exactly does it include them? Trans-non-binary? It doesn't make sense. Trans* implies that someone can be ascribed the prefix trans which doesn't apply to all people that are often considered under trans*.    There isn't a negative connotation behind it, its just an added descriptor to word.   Well there are only so many words that can follow from trans. -woman, -man, -gender, and -sexual. Non-binaries, genderqueers, third genders, all of these people are thus excluded from the implications which buries their identity. That is why it is considered exclusionary.   I don't really understand the fuss behind its usage and I'll keep using it as I please.   I assume you don't go up to gay men and call them lesbians, do you? 'Cause that is similar to what is implied by trans*."

FemmeThoughts,2yl7yq,sillandria,4,Wed Mar 11 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"if you're non-binary, that means you're NOT cis, and therefore are trans by default.   I disagree. Binaries rarely work in simple, exact opposite relationships. In fact, how one defines things tend to show which concept is considered dominate and thus privileged. By claiming that anything not-cis must be trans ""by default"" you are giving privilege to the concept of cisgender thus making the entire definition rest on the perception that cis is the default that everything else is measured up to. This can help perpetuate the idea that cis is ""normal"" since trans is being defined opposed to it instead of being given its own footing. Ultimately, the idea of definition of cisgender rests on the assumption that genital ""go with"" certain genders since it is defined as someone that identifies with the gender that ""matches"" the sex they were assigned at birth. With transgender being the opposite of this, you can see how the entire thing is based on idiotic assumptions. If you are non-binary or agender or third gender, then the idea that certain genders go with certain genitals will itself seem absurd since they identify with genders that can't correspond with any bodily formation. So, given the idiotic basis for the cis-trans binary, I think that it is not helpful to consider everyone not-cis to be trans."

FemmeThoughts,2yl7yq,hermithome,20,Tue Mar 10 21:16:02 2015 UTC,"We happen to have a giant warning for /r/feminism in our related subreddits list, so I'll just quote it here:   [A warning for all] subs controlled by /u/Demmian: /r/Feminism, /r/askfeminists, /r/titleix, /r/GenderEgalitarian, /r/Meta_Feminism, /r/AskFeminism, /r/AskFeminist, /r/AskAFeminist      Some history. Three plus years ago, the /r/feminism sub was abandoned. /u/Cliffor reddit requested it. Cliffor was a mod of r/beatingwomen and had even managed to be banned from /r/mensrights. The request was initially granted, but both /u/sodypop (mod of 2x, see warning above) and /u/kloo2yoo (former admin, founder of r/mensrights and avowed antifeminist) objected and so the admins gave the sub to both of them instead. Link to kloo protesting Cliffor getting the sub, and krispykrackers apologising and agreeing to mod kloo.  So sodypop and kloo2yoo took over /r/feminism and implemented the /r/mensrights mod policies. Eventually, sodypop bowed to community pressure and removed kloo2yoo and added some new mods (one of whom posted regularly to /r/egalitarian and ended up a frequent poster in /r/mensrights). According to sodypop, the new mods fought, and then invited several more mods. By the time the dust settled, all the mods either identified as MRAs or openly stated that they were pro-MRA. Further reading.  One of those mods /u/Demmian is currently the top mod of /r/feminism and several other ""feminist"" communities. Demmian and Soronthur (an admitted Demmian alt) are the only mods of /r/askfeminists and the top mods of several other subs.   Demmian occasionally brings on new mods, but he significantly hampers them, and they often end up leaving or being banned.  Tone is important to Demmian, and he will ban users for disagreeing with his modship, posting in SRS (or even having a name with ""srs"" in it), posting in /r/WhereAreTheFeminists, and for not being polite and conciliatory to MRAs and trolls. He's also very loose on MRAs and frequently allows trolls to derail and dismiss basic feminist precepts. If you so want to particpate in these subs, you may want to cultivate an alt. Both to avoid getting banned for participation in other subs and in order to have an account where you don't break Demmian's tone rules. Demmian does occasionally go for periods without active moderation, but he's the top mod, and until that changes or he actively chooses new moderation, you are at risk of running afoul of these policies.  Users have tried to get /r/feminism turned back over to feminists, but the admins have decided not to intervene."

It comes out of Employment Insurance and that means that if you have more than one kid without working much (or you get illegally laid off while pregnant) you get less if anything at all. It's also impractical with today's changing economics, where for the first time, women under 35 are earning more than their male partners.  My wife makes almost double what I make and when she goes off on leave in a few months (for the second time, yay 2 kids!) we'll be going into our LOC to pay the bills, because EI only gives her around 40% of what she makes when she's working.  That's also the reality for about half of the couples I personally know who are having kids; women in our demographic are more likely to have an undergraduate degree (just look at the number of women to men at any Canadian university versus college) and they're more likely to be earning more than men - until they have kids.  So yeah, it's better than the US, but it's still not good, and it's becoming increasingly worse.  Women who haven't worked or who've not worked enough to qualify for EI won't get anything except the $100-200 a month in parental tax benefits, and that doesn't cover much more than diapers, let alone formula if you go that route."
FemmeThoughts,2yj1wr,Adahn5,3,Tue Mar 10 05:18:58 2015 UTC,"This is actually a major interest of mine, as I hope to work with groups and organizations to re-insert empathy and emotion in the way we communicate in the public sphere. I think the author in this article is missing the point at which taking offense to something is in fact a political act, in the sense that we are ""othering"" people, an act that occurs in small doses up until the point that we engage it in en masse with groups. Specifically here, with women.  Our means of communication and our language are current oriented toward the creation of self-other groups that ultimately do little to resolve conflicts, and over time ostracize and indeed engage in oppression against the ""other"" group. When you combine this with groups who hold the center of power, this language is indeed used to marginalize other groups.  The problem isn't necessarily that someone is offended, per se. The problem occurs when the person who offends no longer participates in treating that person like a human being - that is, someone outside of the archetype that they're opposing. When you're talking to a ""Republican"", you're no longer talking to a human being. When you're talking to a ""Woman"", it lessens the ability of that person to act outside of their role. And, when offending someone, if one doesn't acknowledge at least empathy in that offense, they're no longer seeking to navigate conflict with that person, only to harm them.  The result of all of this is that we lose handle on our emotions, as the article does talk about. We're no longer working through our emotion but commanded by it. I do agree with later parts in the article about the kind of ""co-opting"" of emotion that can sometimes occur.  A lengthy (But beautiful) article I read from a counselor talked pretty eloquently on that idea, on how listening to trauma is actually an act of taking on trauma for oneself, if only in a smaller context. Without the ability to walk with our emotions and be heard, however, we don't heal from that, and the weight of these small burdens grow. I hope this all makes sense and is useful to the discussion."

FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,ruchenn,24,Sat Mar 7 12:33:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, we've had to remove a tonne of comments, so this is a warning to everyone reading this article and commenting here. Take a look at our subreddit rules. Oh, and for the love of my sanity, read the article.  You may not invalidate this woman's experiences, and you may not blame her for them. That is not acceptable under any circumstance. It's also not okay to blame a woman speaking up about sexism for sexism. No fucking way. It's not okay to call her a ""traitor"" or ""evil"" for speaking out about sexism in her industry. WTF! We also don't allow comments that are anti-feminist or misrepresent feminism. If you're going to use terms like ""victim-blaming"", ""internalised misogyny"" or other feminist jargon, then you need to use them properly.  It is not victim blaming for this doctor to say that it is safer for a woman's career to not report harassment. It is her assessment of the severity of sexism and harassment within her industry. It's also not at all okay to hold the responsibility for change on the shoulders of the people with less power and who are being oppressed.  Women who are harassed or assaulted have to make the choice whether or not to report. And while choosing to report can help the field overall for women, it may also cause very high penalties for the woman herself. Reporting harassment and assault often leads to more of the same. And it can absolutely be a career killer. It's an ugly truth, but the truth.  Women who are harassed or assaulted deserve to know what their options are, and what the possible consequences are. They deserve agency.   Feel free to disagree with her advice, or how she's chosen to speak out. Feel free to encourage women to report anyway. Feel free to speak about your own experiences, whether they are positive or negative. But you do not know more about this woman's experiences then she does. And you do not get to blame a woman who is speaking out about sexism in her industry, and laying out the obstacles to gender equality, for the sexism in her industry.   EDIT: Also, you do not get to blatantly misstate someone's actions. In the same way we don't allow people to misrepresent feminism, it is not okay to misrepresent what someone says or does. If you only read the title, and not the article, you are especially at risk for this.     If you have any questions or concerns, please message the moderators.

FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,WizardofStaz,17,Sat Mar 7 20:09:13 2015 UTC,It's not internalized misogyny so much as learned helplessness. She doesn't have to believe women are inferior to believe that the cards are so stacked against them that they can't defend themselves from harassment in the workplace.
FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,blondiekat,3,Sat Mar 7 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"still, I don't think she has an accurate view of things - I dont think that refusing sexual advances will ruin your career anymore no? It would be so sad if refusing a sexual advance would still ruin your career.  I thought that hasn't been true since the 70's or 80's."
FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,WizardofStaz,16,Sat Mar 7 16:10:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on who you refuse. It very well may ruin your job if you work for someone who propositions you. And if they get their word out first that you're a bad employee, bitter, spreading lies, then it can easily fuck you over. Your potential future employers will know it's your word against this person's, and they have likely worked in the industry far longer without public incident.  Nowadays you're right that this scenario is less likely, but it certainly does still happen."
FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,blondiekat,2,Sat Mar 7 16:17:06 2015 UTC,"that is terrifying.  At the rate we are going, this will never end.  should I be prepared to sleep with a superior in my career? I graduate in 6 months.  I dont want to be sexually assaulted or expected to sleep with a superior.  I had no idea this still happened regularly.  I have been raped before already.  If someone at work propositioned me for sex I think it would trigger me or cause regression in my recovery process.  am I just supposed to say yes to unwanted sex to make it go away and  to succeed in my career?  I dont work in the medical field but I am worried that it happens in other areas too"
FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,WizardofStaz,2,Sat Mar 7 17:00:37 2015 UTC,"No, you aren't supposed to say yes. I could never give that advice to someone the way this woman has. I mean, unless you wanted to sleep with someone, the idea of being forced to do it or risk your career is terrible. At the same time... it is a possibility. I would say it is significantly less likely in today's world than in the past. I don't want to scare people away and I know there are much better support systems in place for helping/vindicating victims. I just also don't want people to mistakenly think we live in a world where this sort of thing never happens at all."
FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,blondiekat,2,Sat Mar 7 22:16:38 2015 UTC,"I mean, as someone who has been sexually assaulted, my worst nightmare is having to choose between my job, and and complying to unwanted sex.  There is something about that scenario that is completely terrifying on visceral level to me.  And the fact that it still happens makes feel so sick - like I am not even considered a human."
FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,blondiekat,5,Sat Mar 7 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"From the article:   Dr McMullin said the surgeon began to give Caroline bad reports and faced with the prospect of failing after years of hard work, Caroline finally complained.  After a long and gruelling legal process, Caroline won her case.  ""However, despite that victory, she has never been appointed to a public position in a hospital in Australasia,"" Dr McMullin said."
FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,hermithome,9,Sun Mar 8 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"This comments haven't been removed (we did remove your first comment), but I am going to warn you about invalidating someone else's lived experiences. That is not okay here. Keep that in mind.  It takes a while for people to come forward and say this sort of stuff. If immediately after you report harassment your career takes a nose dive, just about the last thing you're going to do is speak up publicly about it. Because then you're not just the person who reported harassment, you're the person who complained publicly. And that most definitely is career suicide. Instead, you try and fix things. Maybe you move to a different place, where hopefully no one has heard that you reported. You try and keep your head down and work and prove yourself. You try and wait for the person causing the problems to leave.   If you've dedicated yourself to a career, you don't just give up.   We only tend to hear about these sorts of cases when the woman has exhausted ALL of her options and given up entirely on that field. Most of the victims who are pressing cases with the armed services have already left, or been forced out of service. Look at what's happening right now with the CEO of reddit. She's only suing her former company because she's gone from there and safe within another job. Another job where she's top dog and it's much less likely that the lawsuit will cause problems for her there.   My guess is that sadly, this woman is largely right. The events that shaped her view of things happened a few decades ago, but that's still pretty recent. Remember, she's not the only person that lived through these events and were shaped by them. A lot of men were too. And my guess, is that if she'd seen positive change in the intervening decades, she'd no longer be advising students of this. She's likely seen dozens if not hundreds of cases over the years. Some have reported, some haven't. And she's kept track of what happened in their careers.  I get wanting to think that things have changed and that they're better. But it's also pretty ridiculous to simply refuse to believe her learned experiences. This is her life and her career and she's giving career advice based on her experiences. Feel free to disregard that advice, but invalidating her experiences and deciding that you know better is not okay here.     If you have any questions or concerns, please message the moderators.

FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,blondiekat,3,Sat Mar 7 22:58:16 2015 UTC,"ok, thanks, I'm sorry that I made a wrong comment, thank you for not deleting.  That is terrifying - I was raped before. The fact that I need to prepare myself for the fact that I will likely have to have sex with someone that I dont want to have sex with or not report a rape, all for the sake of my career, is terrifying and sad.  It makes me feel objectified and worthless.  Is that really going to happen to me?   I'm so scared.   What should I do if I am at work and a superior wants to have sex with me? will my career be over if I say no? I want to know if this happens outside of the medical field as it does not talk about that in the article"
FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,kochipoik,2,Sat Mar 7 19:52:56 2015 UTC,"No, you don't need to prepare yourself to be raped at work and then not report it. She's not saying that. At all.  And remember, she's only speaking about her experiences in a particular field in a particular country. And she was mostly speaking about quite high achieving women within that field.  And if you work in the private sector, it's not just by field, it's by workplace. Some places have great HR, some don't. And most fields aren't small enough that retribution can follow you from job to job.  Find out what the HR policies are for wherever you work. Maybe also talk to other women colleagues and ask about their experiences.   While it's possible that if you refuse to have sex with a superior your career could be over, it's also not that likely. In certain types of work it would be near impossible. Do you feel comfortable saying what field you work in, and what country?"

FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,redweddingplanner,12,Sun Mar 8 23:27:50 2015 UTC,Did you even read the article? This advice is tongue in cheek after relating the story of a new doctor whose career was ruined after complaining.  She is describing the rampant sexism that female doctors face.

FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,redweddingplanner,2,Sat Mar 7 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"""We need to teach our trainees never to put themselves in a vulnerable position like that, no matter how nice, married and well-meaning the man seems.""   I'm not sure if Dr McMullin is making outrageous victim blaming statements in order to hi-light the gravity of this situation or whether this is something she believes.     In all fairness the best course of action is to fire a few of these ""nice, well meaning, and married"" men.  I would not want anyone who felt like they are entitled to coerce unwanted sex around me when I'm under sedation.   If the medical community is looking the other way when they rape their colleagues sure as shit they won't look out for patients in the same situation."
FemmeThoughts,2y8hhf,hermithome,12,Sat Mar 7 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"If you look at the article in context, she's not victim blaming. She's not saying that it's their fault for being assaulted. She's saying that the environment fucking sucks, and one of the things that that environment has led to is having to teach trainees to go out of their way to avoid men in a variety of contexts.  She's not saying that it's their fault, or that the solution is to teach women to be more vigilant. She's saying that the situation is so bad that these are the sort of warnings that she and her colleagues have had to give women entering the field.  Of course the best course of action is to fire men who harass. The problem is that in a field where harassment and assault are endemic, and where the victims are more likely to suffer from reporting then the perpetrators, you give advice like this to young female surgeons because you want them to be prepared.   If the medical community is looking the other way when they rape their colleagues sure as shit they won't look out for patients in the same situation.    Interesting thought, though I'm not entirely sure I'd agree. The medical community tends to view patients through a very different prism then their colleagues, and I don't know how much overlap there would be. My guess is that these doctors would be more likely to be sexist in general, which yes, can affect female patients terribly, but I'm not sure that the harassment or abuse would correlate."

Selfishly, I fear for everyone- while these are radicals, this movement has made certain strikes into the mainstream.  I was once with my father and he was watching Fox News, and a segment came on about young women pretending to be raped.  One of the panelists said that young women want to have sex with older men, and then scream rape because they are embarrassed. He's a fairly progressive man, but he didn't even flinch hearing this until I went a little bit ballistic.  In my apartment now, where I live with 3 guys, the discussion of ""fake rape"" comes up, as well, or it used to until I hit them with some facts.  They probably still talk about it when I'm not around.  They're not loonies.  They're liberals.  They're all on reddit."
FemmeThoughts,2y70wp,Shadow_x_Banned,3,Mon Mar 9 02:02:06 2015 UTC,"Oh liberals... I know what you mean. It's very hard to deal with people who at least on social issues make relatively cogent allies, but have such tremendous blind spots when it comes to women, or homosexuals, ethnic minorities or trans people. We get this same effect among Socialists and Anarchists (and we call them Brocialists and Manarchists).  It drives me insane that if your ideology demands that you apply a critical analysis that involves identifying unequal distribution of power, oppressive systems of exploitation, and unjustifiable hierarchical structures, you not see that Feminism is a natural and unavoidable component of said ideology. ""Racism? Smash it! Homophoba? Smash it! Patriarchy? Lolwut? There's a female president where I live. Next!""  These are not our comrades. It's why the Anarchists in Spain, for instance, hold up billboards saying 'The Revolution will be a feminist one, or there won't be one!'. Because if you leave the revolution in the hands of cisgender, heterosexual, white, landowning men, then you'll have a country that privileges cisgender, heterosexual, white, landowning men. And damn, wouldn't you know it, that's what we have in the good ol' US of A. A country that started out with neither landless men or women could vote, and where we continued to have slavery until a hundred years later."

FemmeThoughts,2y70wp,greensmurf30,2,Wed Mar 11 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"As I see it, feminism seeks to destroy the idea of privilege altogether by dismantling the power structure that maintains privilege for some, oppression for others.

But I’m not going to explain it to you. You can google it. To quote an old friend, “I’m not the feminist babysitter.”  But here is what I think you should know.  You’re insulting every woman who was forcinbly restrained in a jail cell with a feeding tbue down her throat for your right to vote, less than 100 years ago.  You’re degrading every woman who has accessed a rape crisis center, which wouldn’t exist without the feminist movement. You’re undermining every woman who fought to make marital rape a crime (it was legal until 1993).  You’re spitting on the legacy of every woman who fought for women to be allowed to own property (1848). For the abolition of slavery and the rise of the labor union. For the right to divorce. For women to be allowed to have access to birth control (Comstock laws). For middle and upper class women to be allowed to work outside the home (poor women have always worked outside the home). To make domestic violence a crime in the US (it is very much legal in many parts of the world). To make workplace sexual harassment a crime.  In short, you know not what you speak of. You reap the rewards of these women’s sacrifices every day of your life. When you grin with your cutesy sign about how you’re not a feminist, you ignorantly spit on the sacred struggle of the past 200 years. You bite the hand that has fed you freedom, safety, and a voice.     Libby Anne (via coachk13)"

On a somewhat related note, it reminds me of that famous Freud quote, ""What do women want?"" While he said ""women,"" he was using it like ""female""- I imagine it was more unanimous at the time that women were the other, without even having to invoke the word female.  I never thought too much of it until I read an essay talking about how stupid that question is, assuming all women are these mysterious inconsistent puzzles, totally unlike the rest of humanity, who want some mysterious thing (and all want the same thing).  Similarly to the use of ""female"" by men to describe the behaviors of women, it's also a man trying to answer question about women without, you know, asking them as individuals.  I see this sort of thing all the time on reddit and it boils my blood- ""females want to be dominated in bed"" or ""females are biologically attracted to men with money"" or ""females don't care as much about looks as men"".  All of these could be true for some individuals, and that's fine, but this studying women like we're a separate species has got to stop.

It's ludicrous to expect people to be so grateful that things aren't AS shitty as they were before.

They tend to believe that only legal sanctions against women count as discrimination, and ignore issues in the social sphere.  They have been fed the reactionary media soup that says it's feminists holding women back by ""playing the victim"", and that social issues only exist in the mind or because of biotruths, and, more generally, that all feminists are the same and anti-men.  There tends also to be, among this group, an ignorance regarding global feminism and intersectionality.  This, at least, has been my experience.

FemmeThoughts,2y1l3f,hermithome,11,Thu Mar 5 22:50:25 2015 UTC,Isn't it rather problematic to suggest that there are absolutely no valid reasons for not identifying as feminist? How can feminism possibly be intersectional if it doesn't at all make room for people to not identify as feminist?
FemmeThoughts,2y1l3f,smurgleburf,26,Thu Mar 5 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, but honestly, what could possibly be some reasons for a woman not identifying as a feminist that don't insult its history, and ignore their current privilege to even have their opinion matter? I genuinely can't think of any (and I'm not trying to be antagonistic here), beyond the cliched 'I'd rather be an equalist, that's what it's about anyway, isn't it?', which really just belies a misunderstanding of feminism in the first place."
FemmeThoughts,2y1l3f,hermithome,21,Thu Mar 5 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"Some women, I think generally women of color, identify as ""womanist"" instead of ""feminist"", and I think that's due to historical issues of racism within the various feminist movements, or because various feminist movements haven't always been all that focused on the rights of women of color, sort of thing. Anyway, womanism is a real movement that exists.   But that's also literally never the explanation when I see a picture of a white girl holding up a sign that says she doesn't need feminism, so. But, I'm just saying, that's actually a thing. I'm not super educated on it, but it exists, and is pretty much the only good reason I've seen for someone not identifying as a feminist."

FemmeThoughts,2y1l3f,hermithome,2,Fri Mar 6 07:40:27 2015 UTC,"Section 7. Black feminism of article  Womanism:       The Black feminism movement was formed in response to the needs of the women who felt racially oppressed by the Women's Movement and sexually oppressed by the Black Liberation Movement.  Black feminist scholars assert that African-American women are doubly disadvantaged in the social, economic, and political sphere, because they face discrimination on the basis of both race and gender.  Black women felt that their needs were being ignored by both movements and they struggled to identify with either based on race or gender. African-American women who use the term Black feminism attach a variety of interpretations to it.  One such interpretation is that Black feminism addresses the needs of African-American women that the Feminism Movement largely ignores. Feminism, as Black feminist theorist Pearl Cleage defines it, is ""the belief that women are full human beings capable of participation and leadership in the full range of human activities—intellectual, political, social, sexual, spiritual, and economic"".  With this definition, the feminist agenda can be said to encompass different issues ranging from political rights to educational opportunities within a global context.  The Black feminist agenda seeks to streamline these issues and focuses on those that are the most applicable to African-American women.

FemmeThoughts,2y3vkl,theaftstarboard,2,Fri Mar 6 04:59:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, there's a lot going on here, and I really like it!  It's a very interesting intersectional read.  I have recently been revisiting some Marxist ideology myself, and wondering about the validity of approaching social justice from within such an institution.  It seems fairly impossible, but also, so unimaginably difficult to consider tackling capitalism as a whole.    Here's a few choice quotes for anyone just skimming, that I found particularly interesting:  ""Men’s earning power depends on having someone, typically a woman, do a whole lot of unpaid work in the home. (In recent decades, that housework and child care is increasingly done by immigrant women and women of color for low wages.)""  ""White, middle-class cis women (like me) don’t get to hog the microphone anymore. That’s tremendously exciting in terms of the conversations we’re having with each other, but it also means that there are a lot of arguments happening about what it means to be a “good feminist.” If there are competing versions of reality, it is because we are all living different realities.""  ""When feminists yell at each other IRL, sometimes that can be productive. But when we yell at each other online, I rarely find that it’s working toward a new collective consciousness.""  ""Yes. That’s the entire message of “having it all” feminism. Lean In is predicated on the notion that you’ll also be leaning ON immigrant women, women of color, and poor women.""  To add a few of my own thoughts: the idea of upper middle class, mostly white/cis/het women moving into the roles formerly upheld only by white/cis/het men has always rubbed me the wrong way.  It's sort of an improvement- financial independence is a necessity- but it operates by largely maintaining the status quo.  It's true of many other areas, as well.  A lot of people want to say, well, as long as it's equal, it's fine, and if we're going to be equal, women should aspire to be more like men, but men have been doing a lot of fucked up stuff that I'd rather see end.  An example would be objectifying women and excluding ""unattractive"" (by whatever arbitrary media standards exist) women from all forms of media.  I would rather see this happening to no one than see it happening to everyone.  Or the whole ""equal rights equal fights"" thing.  How about instead nobody hits each other, and we just do away with the whole ""boys will be boys"" stuff to justify men hitting each other, too?  On another note, the construction of the modern feminist sphere is interesting.  Feminists should be critical of each other, even in the online sphere, but I have seen feminist spaces online become ruined by overly zealous policing, which failed to be well informed or pragmatic, and became so twisted to become almost bullying.  There aren't always correct answers.  For instance, on tumblr, the very successful blackout day is possibly being followed by a day called asianinvasion.  It's a polarizing subject, but there are two legitimate sides.  On the one hand, blackout's fantastic success has inspired other minority communities to try a similar event, and minority communities supporting each other is essential.  On the other hand, I've read opinions, sometimes on the same blogs, saying that asianinvasion undermines blackout in the same way the reactionary movement whiteout did. There is a discussion to be had here, certainly, but both sides have legitimate points."
FemmeThoughts,2y3vkl,fraulien_buzz_kill,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:24:15 2015 UTC,"Cool! You basically re-posted my favorite quotes as well.   I particularly like this one:   Lean In is predicated on the notion that you’ll also be leaning ON immigrant women, women of color, and poor women   Which is what I feel is my opinion on high status women like Sheryl Sandburg. I think to myself constantly...why are ANY women giving her a voice AT ALL? She represents the exact embodiment of perfection that the ""patriarchy"" i.e. unhealthy male-driven status quo wants us to be like. She does what she does because she can pay nannies and housekeepers. She has the position she has because while at Harvard and beyond she could willfully and unconsciously embody the perfect quiet, attractive, white cis, unimposing woman who never asked a public question, who never ruffled feathers, who always sat demurely in the back of the class (she desribes it herself!) and was lucky enough to get noticed, who didn't have to struggle with low-income or a history of abuse etc.  So this is how I feel about it. I never liked Sandberg. Even before she was a big ""face"" as she is now. I watched her rise and get her first interviews in the major mags. And she was ""chosen"" not by us, not by grassroots feminists. She was chosen by the elites to represent us. She was chosen by the organizations we are supposed to be whipping into line. And we let them pick our spokesperson like perfect sheep. She isn't our candidate, she's theirs, and she will always represent the big business and the powerful.   So anyway.   Regarding myself. I'm a cis white woman of above-average looks. I get cat-called frequently, so I think that's a pretty good measure. What I find hard is how often people disregard me and my voice just because I'm ""pretty."" I come from a poor background with a very abusive family and I've been sexually abused a number of times in my life, including almost gang raped ( locked in a room by 4 18 year old boys when I was 14 attempted to rape me, but I managed to scream and escape). I'm also marginal in that I have PTSD and depression. So my experience of life is not the ""white woman"" that you see with Sandburg. So I feel that I am an ally but also marginalized. Yet because of my appearance I often willingly step aside and silence myself so that POC and ""curvy?"" women can feel accepted and speak. But its really tough for me, because I don't feel like I fit in with the Sandberg perfection either and why should I? I don't. I'm an aspie as well, so there's also that...  Anyway, that's my thought. Sandberg should be completely ignored as a feminist. She's not one of us, she's a representative of the corporate interests.   Edit: I thought I might add, that Oprah to me is someone who represents us better. People like her did come from a lot of difficulty and resistance. One could question the lifestyle of Oprah given her wealth but IMHO I know people who personally know Oprah and they say she is very hardworking and very conscious of her purchasing power. For example: She buys handmade rugs that are certified slave/child labor free."

FemmeThoughts,2y3pv2,av1698,3,Sat Mar 7 01:46:10 2015 UTC,"I have been working on reteaching myself a lesson that I seem to have forgotten recently. Sometimes it is not worth your energy and time to argue with people to blindly entrenched in their view, or those who really don't care enough to learn more about a topic and just want to have a superficial opinion. You end up spending so much energy and even become emotionally exhausted but there is no result or outcome. I know that it sucks to keep quiet about these sorts of things and sometimes it drives me nuts but I know that at least in my case I won't be able to convince an entire community (or a person that is backed and has their views reinforced by a community) what feminism is and isn't and why it is still important."

FemmeThoughts,2y08dd,fuschialady,8,Thu Mar 5 09:02:56 2015 UTC,"Is your self esteem so low that if you did start to date someone who was abusive, you wouldn't want to leave? Or would ignore red flags? If so, then definitely don't. Past that, my biggest worry would be that putting yourself out there isn't easy, and it can involve rejection, or at least, things that often feel like rejection. If that happened, how off-kilter would it throw you? If you're not sure you can handle that right now, then again, I'd say its still too soon.  Past that, it's hard to say, and it's a judgement call only you can make. That's why your therapist won't answer the question. (Also because, generally speaking, they don't). It also strongly depends on what kind of relationship you're looking for. It might be difficult to build a long term relationship now, but easier to have some short-term fun.  Right now I'm in a relationship purely for fun. We both know it won't be long term, but we like enough other, and are having fun enjoying each other and it's perfect. I get all the perks of a relationship, but without the pressure and strain that my life can't really handle right now."

FemmeThoughts,2y08dd,hermithome,3,Fri Mar 6 07:54:12 2015 UTC,"Do you mind if I ask why you're trying to gauge this?  Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems to me like you're trying to figure out what normal is, and how close you measure up. And I don't entirely understand why. Oh, I get the temptation to, no doubt. But there's just no point in it. What matters is if you feel comfortable entering a relationship. And if you think it would be beneficial to you. And if you think you could leave if it proved otherwise."
FemmeThoughts,2y08dd,hermithome,2,Fri Mar 6 17:30:52 2015 UTC,yah - I am trying to figure out what normal is even though I know that there is no 'normal' really.  I'm trying t o figure out what to strive for or where I am at because I want to have healthy self esteem.  Maybe I have a strange perspective on life then?
FemmeThoughts,2y08dd,hermithome,4,Sat Mar 7 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"No, I definitely get it. The temptation is to think of yourself as outside normal and as everyone else having it more together. And so you want a way to define that, so you can figure out how far away from normal you are. There are a bunch of reasons to do this. To figure out how much work you have to do, to figure out how much you need to explain to people, or how to lower your expectations and what you should aim for.  The problem is, all of these are wrong. You're trying to quantify something unquantifiable and all of the reasons for doing so are bad reasons. So you're not normal. But assuming that there is some sort of normal, and that people will expect that normality from you, and that you're letting them down is just a disaster waiting to happen. It not only makes a lot of big assumptions, but it's also a framework of communication based entirely around what you think others will assume about you, and expect from you.   My advice? Don't think about it, or try not to. Try and cultivate relationships with good, strong, honest communication. Listen to what people actually say, and stop worrying about what you think they're thinking or expecting. It's not going to be applicably most of them time, it'll make you anxious as hell, and it'll make you a poor listener.  I know it's really hard not to project your insecurities onto the people you meet, but it's one of the most important things you can do."

FemmeThoughts,2xzqok,Adahn5,7,Thu Mar 5 05:11:20 2015 UTC,"The Oregon administration accessed the rape survivor’s therapy records from its counseling center and handed them over to its general counsel’s office to help them defend against her lawsuit. They were using her own post-rape therapy records against her.       The university came firing back, arguing that because the rape survivor had asserted a legal claim of emotional distress, Oregon was entitled under, of all things, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to use her medical records to defend against her suit.       However, after researching Oregon’s argument, I stopped laughing. Because it appears that the university was right. By an education-law loophole, it does have a right to her records under Ferpa. And that means everything has to change.  If you are a student and seek counseling at your college’s counseling center, your medical records are most likely not protected by the typical medical-privacy laws, otherwise known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Instead, they fall under the aegis of Ferpa, just as Oregon said. And compared with Hipaa, Ferpa is about as protective as cheesecloth.     Jesus Fucking Christ.      My advice is simple.  Students: Don’t go to your college counseling center to seek therapy. Go to an off-site counseling center. If, God forbid, you’ve been sexually assaulted, try to find a rape-crisis center. It will have wonderful people to talk to, free of charge. (I know from personal experience.) You simply do not have adequate privacy protections if you go to a college-provided counselor. Sorry. (Or, in the University of Oregon’s case, sorry not sorry.)  Instructors: Don’t advise your students to seek counseling in the on-campus counseling center. There is no way that, in good conscience, I can ever give that advice again. If you have a student in crisis, help that student find support off campus.   I hate to say this, because she's absolutely right about the accessibility and cost issues that this causes, but she's absolutely right.   This was an incredibly powerful and sobering read.

If it is severely, negatively affecting the rest of your life and your mental health, as it seems to be doing, then it may be time for a break from school or to consider a new program.  If it is the former, talk to a counselor. Seriously. I have a lot of the same problems that you do. For me, they stem from general anxiety, and talking with a counselor has helped me realize that school is the main focus of my anxiety and taught me steps to handle those feelings when they come.  Finally, don't compare yourself to others, and don't try to get in their heads. :) It's impossible and doesn't do YOU any good (and is a big cause of anxiety, according to my counselor).

I know that I should n't  compare myself to my friends - that isn't what I am doing but looking at them made me realize that I want those things too but I can't juggle them all like they can.  I do love what I study, most of it.  I went to a session with the school counsellor and am going again next week - it is too early to tell if it will be helpful. I have been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder by a psychiatrist.  I am on meds but haven't found other ways of dealing with it yet.  I hope that my counsellor will tell me how to deal with feelings as they come! so far she has told me to try and identify feelings and then accept them as they are. That sounds helpful but I was looking for a few more practical, applicable tools."

FemmeThoughts,2xzgqw,LadysPrerogative,2,Fri Mar 6 05:57:34 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I have a few little pieces of advice for someone else coping with anxiety!  Honestly, your counselor will probably make some of the same suggestions, and would know better than me, but I've found a few things to be very helpful.    1: keeping detailed to do lists, and making sure that there are things on it each day that I can accomplish.  I also like to write down all due dates for everything, which brings me some relief.  I also never let calls go to voice mail, avoid opening bills, delay opening my grades: the anxiety of not knowing is always worse.    2: Connect with people with similar problems online, such as on tumblr or youtube.  Hearing other people's stories of coping and knowing you aren't alone/weird/a failure is important.  I tend to shame myself about it, which adds to the anxiety, which adds to the shame, and so on and so forth, so this helps calm me down.   Here's one I like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjuk3WMZByo&index=18&list=FLG8ndxIjsndjBVukZcDSanw  Finally, 3: definitely what the original comment said: don't compare yourself to others.  Only ever compete with yourself.  Indulge in congratulating yourself for what you have accomplished.  If sometimes that's just surviving?  Well then, by Darwin's standards, you're a fucking winner! Positive self-talk is a big deal, and you deserve it."

FemmeThoughts,2xzgqw,hermithome,6,Mon Mar 9 03:49:40 2015 UTC,"You first need to calm down. Here is a secret most wont tell you: school is not the be all and end all, you matter more then a class or a test or a grade. C's get degrees. Forget about everyone else. Stop comparing yourself to them; they do not matter. It is your education and health that matter. So take a deep breath and let it out. After you calm down its time to learn about time management. Another secret is time management is a skill and it can be learned. First get a good planner. I recommend a physical one for now. Then gather get the syllabus for each class. Now put the major elements and dead lines (tests, project due dates, homework if homework is collected weekly for example) from the syllabus into the calendar in the planner, and make sure you know which class each of these events belongs to. Personally I color coded each class when I was in school. If it makes you feel more comfortable also add in your class schedule. Part two is now figure out about how much time you need for work outside of class. At the moment not things like 'studying' but homework, papers, and project work. These should should be broken down by class as well and noted in your planner with an estimate of how long they will take you if possible. You also want to remember that you need to get enough sleep and eat regular , healthy if possible meals, and if you have to make notes of this in your planner.   Now we'll work on study habits. First off get out of your room. Go to the library and stake out a table or desk. Bring a laptop with you or get a library computer. Or see if your school's student center/student union/campus center has an area you can work in. Just get out of the bedroom. Secret #3 your brain will do better if you work on one thing for 45-50 min and then take a 10-15 minute break. So pull out your most pressing thing (which you know because its all in your planner) and work on it for the next 45 min. In this 45 min that is all that matters. After that set it aside. You now have 15 min to yourself. Use the restroom or get a snack or pull out a book anything that is not school. If you still have something left from the previous task lets get back to that, but stick to the same pattern. Don't try and boil the ocean. One task at a time. If you're still having trouble working on your own, see if there is a study group in the class you can join. Or grab some friends who are also in the class and ask them to form one. I promise they wont judge you for it. My study group is probably the only reason I didn't flunk Biochemistry II.    Now this is the most important piece. Go make an appointment with your school's mental health center right now. You should probably do it before even getting a planner. Talk to them about all of this. They can help you figure out what services the school offers to help you succeed. This may be setting up tutoring or seeing if you qualify for extended times for test taking, or even just talking to them. Final secret you do not have to do it on your own. The school has services that can help you and I'm willing to bet if you asked your friends they'd be willing to help as well.    It is going to be hard. You've gotten yourself so wrapped up in your own head it may seem overwhelming but you can do it. So good luck and remember above all breath."
FemmeThoughts,2xzgqw,hermithome,2,Thu Mar 5 05:57:20 2015 UTC,"thank you for typing out all of that advice!!  I  think I will give that study habit thing a try!!  I haven't tried the 45 minute rule yet because I keep thinking 'ahh then that's 15 mins out of every hour that I am not studying! that's so much time gone!' but....maybe that's actually a more efficient way of studying because it gives your brain a time to refresh and therefore you do more efficient, faster, and better work in the 45 mins instead of powering though the 60 mins without a break.  Also I have never studied in a coffee shop - only my bedroom so I should try that too!  I want ot see if my brain will work better that way, like you said.  I have done some of the rest -I went to accessibility services at school and they set me up with a counsellor - I have had one appt with her so far.  I am able to write a test in another room if I want to also, since I have a diagnosed mental condition (an anxiety disorder)  And I have a word document that I always keep on my desktop that is like an electronic planner - divide up by things I need to do in days, weeks, months, and year along with other notes or resources (ie instructions on how to meditate, websites with strength training instructions, other life things etc)  I know, employers dont look at grades - I dont know why I feel overwhelmed if I know that.  For some reason I work slowly and am not good at quickly moving from one task to another.  This is frustrating because it prevents me from doing other important things in my life that aren't studying (hobbies, friends, physical exercise etc)"
FemmeThoughts,2xzgqw,hermithome,2,Thu Mar 5 08:44:19 2015 UTC,"Get a physical planner and not just a word doc. The act of writing things down can help you remember what you have to get done and you can access it even when you aren't at your computer. Being able to look at your schedule and flip through you schedule can be reassuring.  I understand that getting used to the study pattern can cause anxiety, but every time you start to think about everything else you need to get done remind yourself 'No these are my 15 min. I need these 15min'. These can also help you transition between tasks because your brain has a break to process and then switch gears. Also try a library over a coffee shop. Libraries were made for studying. You can do this. It will be hard work but you can do this. How do I know this? I had anxiety, depression and my senior year PTSD. If I can do it so can you."
FemmeThoughts,2xzgqw,pencilears,1 point,Thu Mar 5 12:26:00 2015 UTC,"thanks :) that makes me feel better.  PTSD - that's intense, sorry you had to go though that!  Do you feel like you learned skills that translated into your career too?"
FemmeThoughts,2xzgqw,pencilears,2,Fri Mar 6 06:01:49 2015 UTC,"Time management will be the biggest asset you can learn and will help with your career. Its important to be able to look at what you have to do, figure where the priority is, and efficiently use your time to get as much as you can done. To be honest I some times still struggle with it, but I keep refining it because it is important. I also still write everything down. I have a project notebook for any notes or brainstorming on any projects I'm involved with. This is also important because I can look back at during performance review and know exactly what I was working on and when because I date every time I write in it. It makes it much easier then trying to remember under pressure. I keep a separate notebook just for notes I take during meetings, those sometimes then get transfered into my projects book. Then I keep a 'to do' notebook. This is just for when I have a very specific list of things to do on a certain day or week or any very specific tasks. I can then check them off as I get them done. My calendar is electronic, but that's mostly for the 5 minute till the meeting reminders, and because everything is scheduled through outlook. So yes I think the skills I learned to in school I applied to my career I suppose is what this rather long answer is trying to say."

FemmeThoughts,2xzgqw,pencilears,2,Fri Mar 6 06:46:28 2015 UTC,"My friends (who I do not actually see often) suggest that I aggressively incorporate exercise, meditation, hobbies, and a social life into my schedule and THEN plan school around that to force myself to get more done in less time. They also say that once I get hobies, a social life, and better mental/physical health, then I will naturally focus better at school, be happier ,and do better work   This is a bit of a chicken vs egg thing. Yes, its often easier to schedule if you have a lot going on. Part of it is because there are fewer choices involved: you know where you need to be when. You know that you absolutely have to study during this x hour block, because if you don't, you won't be able to do X and Y and Z. That's also a great motivational tool. And going out and doing other things and having hobbies and getting physical exercise in mean that your mind gets breaks in all of these useful and important ways.  Plus once something is a habit its easier. Pretend you go swimming once in a while. When do you get out of the pool? When you feel like you've had enough? When you have someplace you need to be? When you notice it getting dark? Do you argue with yourself about 5 more minutes, or one last dive, or whatnot? Does that end up taking a significant amount of time? Compare that to someone who comes to the pool every day for an hour. That back and forth and that energy expounded into figuring stuff out....all of it is gone. You know that you arrive at A, and you leave at B. You know that you can stay C minutes longer, but only if conditions D and E are met. And you know you'll be back tomorrow. It's just a vastly different experience. Even if you physically go through the same motions, mentally its just different.  Problem is, your friends are also a bit wrong. Yes, its easier to focus when you're busy and get physical exercise and have diverse activities. But its hard to just throw yourself into that, and trust that school will come. Especially if you're anxious.  My advice is a multi-pronged approach. First, start by recognising the stuff you do get done. I'll take an example from my life. A lot of days I would feel unproductive because I hadn't gotten anything done. I'd just been doing adult chores: groceries, clean-up, laundry, replying to e-mails & phone calls. All the shit you need to do, but doesn't feel like it counts. So I'd be really busy all day, but feel terrible about myself. And I hated doing chores and errands.   I decided to change that. I started by making big checklists. Because the act of checking something off a checklist and seeing my todo pile shrink has a good positive effect on my brain. Eventually, I shifted my entire thinking about this stuff. I came to recognise that being a grown-up is hard work, and it's okay to treat it that way. So I complain about my chore workload, and then I brag when I get it done. Which is my coping technique in general for work stuff. And just being able to do that, and getting responses from people is hugely rewarding. I get recognition that this stuff isn't easy, and I get recognition of a job well done. And that alone, that mental shift has meant that I no longer feel bad about chores and errands. When I have a day of nothing but chores, I still feel like I accomplished stuff at the end of the day. I feel good about it, I feel proud. And that means that I enjoy the day, and enjoy the work, and don't stress out or get anxious. And that's huge. Nothing has changed but my mindset really, but it's a huge change.  The second is to incorporate one thing at a time. Choose one thing first: some form of exercise or physical activity, some hobby, a going out thing, whatever. Choose one, and make it a habit. Do whatever it is regularly for two weeks. The first two weeks are the hardest, but once its a habit, it'll be hugely easier. You can do more than one thing during those first two weeks: I'm not saying that if you choose exercise you shouldn't also see your friends. I'm simply saying to focus on one thing, and make it a habit.  For part three, lie to yourself. Seriously. Look yourself in the mirror every day and tell yourself that you're good at organising things, that you're competent, that you've got your shit together. Whatever the stuff you most need. I know it sounds silly. But the more you believe in your capabilities, the better. And if you tell yourself a lie everyday, it will become true, at least in terms of how you see things. Like habits, it seems impossible at first, but all you really need to do is focus on it for a while.   This isn't advice that will replace seeing a counsellor. I'm glad you're seeing one, and I hope it helps. But there's a lot you can do both in terms of brain retraining and perspective tooling, and in terms of concrete changes to your schedule."
FemmeThoughts,2xzgqw,thedoctoralwayslies,2,Thu Mar 5 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"thank you for typing all of that out, that's excellent advice.   two weeks - yes I think I could hold out for two weeks while something becomes a habit - then I know it won't be a lifelong struggle atleast.  and I will see if lying to myself eventually works!  I dont know if my counsellor will be of any help but I hope she does because I really need help lol!"
FemmeThoughts,2xzgqw,Aberrance,2,Fri Mar 6 06:35:05 2015 UTC,"It doesn't mean that there's no effort involved after two weeks. It's just that its the first two weeks that are so monumentally hard, and where most people give up.  Its worth it to take extra time in order to get you into the right mental framework for something. For example, one great suggestion for people trying to start a workout routine is to go to the gym and then not work out. Listen to music, meditate, have a smoothie, have fun. First get down the habit of going to the gym. Get yourself into a place where going to the gym is a part of your schedule, and you have positive mental associations with it. And then start slowly incorporating exercise. This technique works great for exercise, but you can apply it to other things too. For example, if you make a date to go out with friends, but find it exhausting and overwhelming by the end, and don't enjoy it, it'll be harder to motivate yourself to get back out there. Just like exercise. You can start by setting the time aside in your schedule and going out. Maybe go through whatever prep you do to go out with friends: chose a restaurant or movie, do your makeup, whatever. Get yourself going through the motions. Things are always way less scary if you break them down into bite-size, manageable pieces.   If you can manage to remove most of the stress and anxiety you feel so that you enjoy your day, so that however much time you spend studying, you enjoy it, or at least don't feel badly about it, that's huge. You'd be surprised just how much time and energy worrying, and feeling badly about something can take up.  There's an amazing essay I just read yesterday, on how a woman with PTSD and other major mental health issues learned how to be okay with feeling sad. Not to undermine her other issues, but a huge thing for her was that feeling sad instantly triggered other feelings. Because there's such a strong societal association of sad as a bad thing.    The alarm I experienced over my sadness was another terrible feeling on top of my already terrible symptoms. The energy I spent panicking that I was sad could have been better spent on coping with the sadness. It was true that I — like many people, people with clinically depressed, never-ending, or life-threatening sadness — needed a lot more assistance than just a big philosophical hug, but if I could accept sadness, my therapist kept suggesting, I would be able to experience it (long and hard as that may go on) and then it could pass. The alternative — being sad, plus condemning yourself for being sad — only heightens the suffering. And, likely, the time it lasts.   Finding acceptance isn't easy. Whether it's with sadness or anxiety or anything. It's something I've had to fight for quite hard myself. But there's an invaluable level of calm that it gives you when you get there. I'm now often able to recognise how I'm feeling and say ""that's okay. that's appropriate for this situation. we're doing good."" And the ability to do that, to accept how I'm feeling, and give myself space to feel it is huge. It enables me to get the fuck on with the rest of my life.    She told me to open my eyes and when I did, asked me what sensation I noticed. Instantly, I pictured a kid lying in a yard.  That’s me right now, I thought. A kid lying in a yard, feeling sad — but not feeling sad about feeling sad. It was what it was. It was fine. It was a peace. Me, or a kid, being just what she was: alive.   It is not easy to get there. But faking it til you make it can help. Just the way that little kids fall down, tell themselves ""you're okay"" and then believe themselves and get back up. There's an incredible power in telling yourself that it's okay. That you're stressed, but that's okay. That and being able to recognise the positive things you are doing....it's just huge. It's not easy. Most people feel like frauds, or super silly or even embarrassed and ashamed trying some of these techniques. But they can seriously help.  Oh, also, one more tip. When something good does happen, whatever it is, write it down, and stick it into a large jar. This has multiple benefits. One, it forces you to recognise good things, whatever they are. It can be ""I cooked an awesome dinner tonight"" or ""I got an A on a test"" or ""I was feeling anxious and managed to let it go and enjoy myself"". Whatever it is, it forces you to recognise it. And writing it down makes it more concrete then if its just a passing thought. And then, when you are feeling low, you can go back and dive into those memories. When you're feeling like you haven't accomplished anything, you'll have proof that you're wrong. It's a nice security blanket. And if you don't need that blanket, save it for New Years, and open it up and reminisce and appreciate how much you're done and grown. Plus, the jar is a great way to incentivise good behaviour. It's like earning gold stars on a chart.   I hope some of this helps! I believe you can do it. It'll probably suck at times, and you'll want to give up, but I think you can."

FemmeThoughts,2xm6yq,ArsenicAndRoses,33,Mon Mar 2 14:50:51 2015 UTC,"As an aside, the meaning of the proverb ""a few bad apples"" used to mean something completely different than its common usage today:   But as the memory of rotting apples fades, the meaning of the ""bad apple"" proverb has changed. In 19th century America, it was a staple of Sunday morning sermons: ""As one bad apple spoils the others, so you must show no quarter to sin or sinners."" Or it could suggest that finding one malefactor in a group should make you suspicious of everybody else. ""A bad apple spoils the bin,"" one journalist wrote in 1898 of the Dreyfus Affair; if one officer is capable of forgery then why wouldn't others be as well?  Back then, nobody ever talked about ""just a few bad apples"" or ""only a few rotten apples"" — the whole point was that even one was enough to taint the group. These days, those are the phrases people use to imply that some misdeeds were an isolated incident — a couple of rogue cops, a handful of unprincipled loan officers, two or three sociopathic soldiers.   http://www.npr.org/2011/05/09/136017612/bad-apple-proverbs-theres-one-in-every-bunch  Always ironic when someone uses it to argue that ""not all men,"" and similar arguments."

FemmeThoughts,2xm6yq,hermithome,6,Sun Apr 19 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"Where can I see this movie?   It’s set for broadcast on BBC4 this coming Sunday (2015-03-08) as part of their Storyville series ‘showcasing the best in international documentaries’. No help if you are outside the UK, of course.  Depending on the rights the BBC purchased, however, this broadcast could mean India’s Daughter will then be available for viewing online for 30-days via the BBC’s iPlayer service (the Storyville-specific iPlayer ‘channel’ is here).  This is also not much help for those outside the UK because the iPlayer service is geo-locked to IP addresses within the UK. Not entirely unreasonable given the BBC is funded by UK taxpayers but no less frustrating for being somewhat reasonable.  You can work around this, however, with a VPN service that makes you appear to be within the country or locale allowed access to the otherwise geo-locked material. FWIW, I use the combination of Google’s Chrome desktop browser and Hola for this. Hola works with more than just Chrome but that’s the combination I’ve gotten into the habit of using (and it’s pretty much the only thing I use Chrome for).  It’s also being broadcast in Canada on CBC this coming Sunday (2015-03-08) as part of that network’s The Passionate Eye series. And, as with the BBC, and likewise depending on the rights they purchase, the CBC makes documentaries available on-line for a limited period after initial broadcast.  I suspect the CBC also geo-locks these shows (and for the same reason the BBC does: the CBC is funded by Canadian taxpayers), but a VPN service will likely work here as well.  I took a quick look but haven’t found any other broadcasters scheduled to play the doco.  The US distributor is, apparently, Women Make Movies, but I couldn’t find India’s Daughter listed in their current catalogue or in their New Releases section.   I live in Japan and really want to watch it.   India’s Daughter is listed as available to distributors via IDFA’s Docs for Sale programme. (The Docs for Sale page for India’s Daughter also lists the spoken languages used in the film as Hindi and English and the available subtitle languages as English only. This may explain why it’s not currently set for broadcast outside the Anglosphere even if it doesn’t explain why it hasn’t — apparently — been picked up by broadcasters such as the ABC in Australia and PBS in the United States.)  I don’t know Japan’s media landscape at all well, but industry-specific news services (ie Japan’s equivalent to Variety or The Hollywood Reporter) tend to report on things like which broadcaster has purchased the rights to what films and tv shows.   Can I find it online?   Sorry to not be more specific but I hope this is at least some help."

It sounds like an amazing career!  Anyway, I like when people write articles from the perspective of sex being something that everyone does, because I dont think of it that way and I should/am trying to.  I was raped and am still trying to be ok with sex as a pleasurable thing.  I can't orgasm very well/quickly and I get jealous of friends who can have one night stands all over the place for fun - I tried that and one night stands are so boring to me because they are awkward and I never orgasm from them so my friends see me as a prude because I also do not drink often (only sometimes) for health reasons - I like being skinny and fit and going ot the gym.  Which brings me to another point, I have trouble enjoying sex because I hate my body and it feels like sex is only for the young and/or beautiful.  I feel like I should sleep with a million men asap because if I dont I will regret it later by wasting my youth not having tons of sex.    It's interesting to hear perspectives about who sex is part of the human condition instead of a luxury because I find it hard to enjoy sex and have good sex (ie dating is hard, one night stands dont do it for me), I feel like I am not hot enough to be sexy anyway, and what is the point of having  a sexuality if I will get old and wrinkly soon?

Women still make less in the same jobs"" however this one article isn't exactly a super trustworthy source of information. Am I just missing all the citation somewhere on the website?"
FemmeThoughts,2xl83a,codayus,9,Mon Mar 2 00:09:40 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but it's actually not a great article.  It does make a lot of factual assertions, but as you note they're all unsourced.  Worse, at least some are just wrong.  Skimming it:   Claims Belgium has the lowest wage gap ""in the world"" at 6%.  Which is odd; the best numbers I found said Belgium was the 5th best in the OECD with 7%, with NZ best at 4.2% (cite).  Not a huge difference, but 1) I can't find a data set that looks at the wage gap for all countries in the world, and 2) I can't find a data set that ranks Belgium as best, even within Europe. Claims that adjusting for hours worked, the wage gap in Canada is 20%.  I'm not very familiar with Canada, but Google turned up this paper which claimed that ""women still earn less than men: in 2011, the average hourly wage of women working full-time in Canada was 87 percent that of men"".  Another paper found it to be 85% in 2006.  Again, it's not a huge difference, but not an insignificant one either. The argument about maternity is hard for me to parse.  It seems to be suggesting that since maternity leave can't explain the entire gap, it must not be a factor, which is clearly a false choice.  In any case, they seem to be carefully avoiding giving any actual numbers here (the best they do is suggest that for younger women the gap is ""10-20%"", but since they lump in women with children, this seems meaningless.  Worse, it's been widely publicized that in the US ""Census data from 2008 show that single, childless women in their 20s now earn 8 percent more on average than their male counterparts in metropolitan areas.""  (cite)  That's a very narrow claim, and while it doesn't outright disprove their claim (which is much fuzzier, and about a different country entirely) it badly undercuts their point. As for the question of whether women choose (or are forced) into lower paying jobs, they are again making logical errors.  It's simply a fact that female dominated fields do tend to be lower paying.  They attempt to debunk this by pointing out that in many female dominated fields the men in them—while also low paid—tend to make more money than the women.  True, but so what?  The fact that male teachers tend to make more money than female teachers (I'm assuming this claim is correct; it's very plausible) doesn't change the fact that most teachers are women (1), most computer programmers are men (2), and most teachers make less money than most computer programmers (3 and 4).   Worse, it feels like the wrong argument to me.  What IF the wage gap was largely the result of, eg, discrimination forcing women into lower paid fields?  Does that magically make it okay?  I would say—I'd hope everyone would say—that the answer is ""fuck no"".  In which case, why do we need to try and prove that the wage gap isn't even partly the result of the jobs women end up working?  Similar argument applies to maternity.  Even IF the wage gap was largely the result of wages cratering once women reach median childbearing age, does that magically make it okay and perfectly sensible?  Is the very large wage penalty that people who want flexible hours must suffer simply a natural law?  Must we accept that success at the most challenging careers (finance, tenured academia, politics, etc.) will invariably require the sort of gruelling work/life balance that makes having kids an almost impossible dream for all but a tiny elite?  And so on.  In short:  I'm not thrilled with the article.  What factual claims they make seem to be mostly wrong, and the overall thrust rubs me the wrong way.  But no, you're not missing the citations.  :)"

FemmeThoughts,2xipby,hermithome,13,Sun Mar 1 01:40:33 2015 UTC,"So, my family gets both EBT (foodstamps) and WIC. EBT is simple. You pick out your food that you want and use it just like a debit card. Nobody in your line has to know that you're using foodstamps and it doesn't take any longer than a ""regular"" transaction.  Using WIC checks is a nightmare if you don't remember all the specific brands and restrictions. Some stores have a little WIC designation on the price marker below the product, but most don't. It takes longer to pick out your food because you have to check the size, ingredients, and brands of almost EVERYTHING on the WIC vouchers. Then, when you go to check out, you need to tell your cashier before they scan anything that you are paying with WIC checks. Then, they have to check off everything on the WIC voucher and make sure everything matches and then you need to sign the WIC check. Then this process needs to be repeated another one or two times, as everything isn't on one check.  They just recently made it so that you can buy fruits and vegetables that aren't ""regular"" fruits and vegetables (eg oranges, apples, spinach, carrots, etc.) in my state. So, no grapefruit, no kiwi, no pineapple, no pomegranates, no white potatoes, no organic fruits or vegetables, no squash, etc. Now most of that has been overturned, except for the white potatoes.  tl;dr: Using WIC checks/vouchers is time-consuming, tedious, and conspicuous."

I refer to it as the year I became myself. I started seeing just me, not people (men) watching me. I got to figure out so many incredibly important things. Ideas and arguments got to simmer in my brain and I got to take the time to truly change in a variety of deep ways. I can't say if I was truly happy during that year, but I was pretty content.

My take differs a bit. Although I'd like to imagine this strategy is in its dying days as demographics shift, I think it's more accurate to say the strategy is outsourced.

I've been able to find it in full online though, so I'm pretty thrilled to be able to share it with you guys!  I really do think female friendships are so important. I used to be the ""I don't have a lot of female friends"" kind of girl - mostly by circumstance, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider myself to be just a little cooler than most girls because I 'hung with the boys' (this was mostly in highschool, early university). This article perfectly describes what I had a hard time articulating about why that can be toxic.  As I've grown up though, I still have many very strong male friendships, but I've learned to seek out and value female friendships. My girlfriends are amazing, and I'm really glad that I don't deprive myself of that rich part of the relationship tapestry because of some ridiculous block about women being more high-strung/drama-centric, or whatever the hell reason some women have for not wanting women friends. Nowadays, if I meet a woman (my age - almost 30) who says to me 'I don't really get along with girls, just too much drama (or whatever)', I instantly know that those other women aren't the problem - she is. It's not that she won't be friends with other women - they probably want very little to do with her. If it's someone younger though, I tend to ascribe it to that same 'phase' I went through... though I would hope now that younger women are able to not ascribe 'coolness' to masculinity and are able to find interesting-ness and relatability in femininity a little easier than I was able to."

FemmeThoughts,2x92e8,SweetNyan,8,Fri Feb 27 02:38:00 2015 UTC,"The author specifically says that the ""sex-negative"" she is describing is not the opposite of ""sex-positive"". Either way, I don't really see why it's something that ought to be ""reclaimed"" in the way ""slut"" (for example) was. I consider myself ""sex-positive"", but I am still deeply critical of the way that patriarchy causes us to form cultural assumptions about power imbalance and burden of responsibility in sex and sexual assault. Not only do they not seem mutually exclusive to me, I don't really see a way to unironically call oneself ""sex-positive"" without considering those issues even more carefully."
FemmeThoughts,2x92e8,bombeater,3,Fri Feb 27 02:45:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that I don't think reclaiming ""sex negative"" seems useful to me. What do you think of her other intention, to reclaim ""prude""? I'm more interested in that one, I think."

FemmeThoughts,2x92e8,Shaysdays,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:57:52 2015 UTC,"I'm always trying to get to the bottom of this objection because I genuinely don't get it. Rather than talking about what I'm telling ""women"" (a bit abstract), can you answer, do you feel that I'm telling you (assuming you're a woman?) how you should feel about your sex life and body? If so, are you up for summarising which bits make you feel that way and why? And is there a way in which the thought, ""sex is socially constructed, and some of that construction sucks"" could be phrased in a way that doesn't make you think I'm talking directly about you? It's something I tried to pick apart in the bit at the end, about how conversations can go wrong between sex+/sex- feminists, particularly the way that general points come over as personal points. I'd love to hear from someone who heard it as personal any advice on how to phrase it in a way that makes it more general."
FemmeThoughts,2x92e8,radtransfem,1 point,Fri Mar 6 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"Oh hey! It's very nice of you to ask. I'm going to re-read what you wrote and try to tease out exactly what bugged me.  This may be a little all over the place, it's late here. So this is just me replying, I only represent that viewpoint.   ""sex is socially constructed, and some of that construction sucks""   I'm with you there. Some of that construction does suck male ass. Or at least it would, if that wasn't taboo. (sorry, I'm a doofus sometimes.)  Alright, if I am wrong, correct me, but I believe you are talking about sex as an act practiced in society in general. And you are arguing that the act of sex is rooted (as it is practiced now) in patriarchy and cannot be changed from that impetus.  That's where you're going to lose me. Because I personally feel like you're telling me, as a person who is pretty happy with my sex life, that I am essentially Doing It Wrong. In particular:   That, under patriarchy, men are considered to have a right of sexual (and otherwise) access to women, a right which it is compulsory for women to grant and for men to exercise, the burden of meeting this compulsion falling unequally on women   Nope.  While on a widespread basis, I'd agree that is a valid viewpoint to consider, this doesn't apply to me, I can have sex or not based on what my partner feels like doing.   You explained in great detail the seraglio idea of sexuality - where women have to wait for the men in their lives to favor them with sex or not, and in particular how to step out of that mode altogether but (other than either or both of us being exhausted) that does not really apply to my life.  Up until    We need to be able to admit that what perpetrators do is what the world calls sex, and that it is not nice, and that it is not the fault of survivors and its other casualties for not finding it nice but is in fact due to the nature of sex under patriarchy.   I was mostly with you. But when you said that sex is not nice, no matter who partakes in it, that's when I felt like I was being preached to, because frankly, you may think you know what's good for me when it comes to sex. But you only have an idea. It may be a good idea, and you can argue it well, but it's still your idea, and you're not the one having sex with my mind and body.  Okay, I'm sorry this is a bit shorter than I wanted to make it, but I was working and I got home around 2 am. If you have any more questions or see anything you need me to expand on I will do my best tomorrow!"
FemmeThoughts,2x92e8,Shaysdays,0,Sat Mar 7 08:35:41 2015 UTC,"Can I just focus in on the last bit (if that doesnt work we can go back to all of it) because I think that might be the core of the kind of disconnect that's happening?  You quoted this bit:   We need to be able to admit that what perpetrators do is what the world calls sex, and that it is not nice, and that it is not the fault of survivors and its other casualties for not finding it nice but is in fact due to the nature of sex under patriarchy.   And said:   ... when you said that sex is not nice, no matter who partakes in it, that's when I felt like I was being preached to...   Lemme reformat the bit of the essay you quoted and see if it changes its meaning?   We need to be able to admit that what perpetrators do is not nice (even though the rest of the world routinely calls that same thing ""sex"" - like, ""what's your problem? you had sex then regretted it?""), and that it is not the fault of survivors and its other casualties for not finding it nice but is in fact due to the nature of sex under patriarchy.   That way it sounds a bit like a tautology, sure: ""when people do bad things the bad things they do are not nice"". But it sounds like a tautology, I think, because I'm trying to uncover a true thing.  An observer who has looked at sex which both participants may well have found nice, and who also looks at what a perpetrator does, might well struggle to articulate what is different in the perpetrator's behaviour.  I'm suggesting this isn't because the observer is confused or wrong but because the social scripts for sex and the social processes of perpetrating assault are deeply interwoven.  That's why perpetrators can say, ""Wtf? I was just doing what anyone does and she's gone and screamed rape!"" and they're not necessarily lying. That's why studies which look at the attitudes of perpetrators tend to find that they're pretty normal people without any especially weird attitudes about sex. They're doing broadly normal stuff and there is something messed up about normal stuff."

FemmeThoughts,2x92e8,obscurityknocks,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:54:44 2015 UTC,"Other way around - I picked up on ""sex-negative"" because I wanted to work toward a situation where ""you're just sex-negative!"" wasn't as effective a conversation-stopper any more - where instead, the woman called ""sex-negative"" could retort ""and what's wrong with that?"" It's worked well to stop conversations since it was coined in the States (I know the history!) but lately the thought-stopping edge has been wearing off the term. The article was part of that effect, and I'm proud of that. :)"
FemmeThoughts,2x92e8,radtransfem,1 point,Fri Mar 6 14:03:29 2015 UTC,"Did you write this article?  Because if so, can I just say, it really spoke to me.  I had sort of a crisis of sexuality last summer in which I wrestled with many of the kinds of subjects you address in this article.    This quote stands out to me: ""It means upholding those standards if you fuck the way he says, and dealing with his censure if you fuck differently or not at all.""  It just really resonates for me.  There's this oppressive cultural insistence on setting up sex as a power dynamic in which men have power.  Having only been sexually active for a short while, I had felt I could avoid this, but it occurred to me how politicized the bedroom was and I felt this horrid feeling of violation.  I don't want to tell other women and men how they have to have sex- that wanting to play out this power dynamic is wrong- but at the same time I feel like this dynamic is taught to us, forced on us.  It's not about moralizing, as you said, but it's worth discussing the politics.  How strange is it that all women are assumed to enjoy being spanked or slapped?  Or that having a man come on your face is somehow ""disrespectful?"" (the stated reason my SO felt uncomfortable doing this to me).  Why should women who want to be ""dominant"" have to done phallus's?  Again, there's nothing morally wrong with wanting to do these things, and I don't want to tell people they shouldn't do them, and enjoy them thoroughly if they like!  But I'm also critical of a society where we accept all of these things for granted.  I'm sorry.  I'm probably not making a tonne of sense.  To put it shortly: I spent my life drinking the patriarchal sex cool aid, and am now deeply uncomfortable with how it's affect me."

Eventually all things are consumed by the sands of time, but I am less optimistic about these groups just vanishing. He mentions that gamergate is ""dead"", but the article he references only bashes gamergate's legitimacy, it doesn't actually have data on how many followers still support it.  The problem is that communities of like-minded individuals are self-reinforcing. As outsiders we view their beliefs as non-sensical, but there is an internal coherence to their ideas that defy fact. There are all sorts of groups that coexist in our society today whose beliefs conflict with their 'mainstream' neighbors. We have neo-NAZIs, doomsday cults, Westboro Baptist church, and scientologists; just to name a few. Confirmation bias and congitive dissonance, coupled with social influence and community structure, create an environment where outlandish beliefs-systems can thrive.  Reddit is a place that fosters this kind of environment. Unless we want to wait for a whole generation to pass us, these people are here to stay. Reddit and other social networking sites need to be pressed to implement policy or structural changes that get rid of these groups. Censorship may not even be necessary if we are only interested in behavioral change --perhaps through gamification."

Gamergate is ""dead"" in the sense that it has little influence. It's not clear how many people actually are or ever were a part of GG at its peak—although thirty to fifty thousand is a good guess. This makes them, at best, a ""rounding error"" compared to the size of the community for whom they claim to speak. And, because of their vitriol, even people who might be inclined to agree with their purported ideas have been turned off. In short, the dream of GG (pushing progressive ideas out of gaming, or even just individual progressives out) might have been stillborn, but is definitely dead at this point.  As for the rest.. I don't see how Reddit can be helped or saved. It's getting progressively worse as time goes on and a reactionary circlejerk overtakes the defaults. It's 4chan's story writ large: a site that at first takes for granted a liberal population, only to realize that ironic ""jokes"" and the like have attracted the exact opposite.

Aggressive men on the internet have been silencing us for years.  How many times were you berated for ""outing"" yourself as female (or saw it happen to other women)?  How many times have you heard ""tits or gtfo""?  Does this image look familiar?  Did you give up eventually, like I did, and play along so that you could discuss what you wanted to without being harassed?    They think we weren't around because they've been telling everyone, including us, that we don't exist.  They think we're newcomers because it's a relatively recent thing that we stopped putting up with their bullshit en masse and became visible as women.

This rule does not mean what you think it means.    In real life, people like you for being a girl.  They want to fuck you, so they pay attention to you and they pretend what you have to say is interesting, or that you are smart and clever.  On the Internet, we don't have the chance to fuck you.  This means the advantage of being a ""girl"" does not exist.  You don't get a bonus to conversation just because I'd like to put my cock in you.    When you make a post like, ""hurr durr, I'm a girl"" you are begging for attention.  The only reason to post it is because you want your girl-advantage back, because you are too vapid and too stupid to do or say anything interesting without it.  You are forgetting the rules, there are no girls on the Internet.    The one exception to this rule, the one way you can get your ""girlness"" back on the Internet, is to post your tits.  This is, and should be, degrading for you, an admission that the only interesting thing about you is your naked body.    tl;dr: tits or GET THE FUCK OUT."

I liked this article but it's willingness to give male ownership to the history of internet future erases the contributions of women (who already lack representation) and kind of bothered me. The central point about the irrelevance of the nerd trope stands though: it's dangerous and inaccurate to keep re telling the story of the poor oppressed nerd when that nerd is now the most powerful archetype in the world and their oppression is actually a refusal to treat others as human beings.

We do have the creepy misogynistic/racist/vitriol-filled subs, but that's not everything. We're currently having this discussion on one of the successful feminist subs. I hate the nasty subs, and the Red Pill has done so much damage, but there are good parts to Reddit. The suicide watch subs, AskHistorians, /r/NoStupidQuestions even, which although sometimes ridiculous, is a place for free exchange of information, which utilizes the anonymity of the internet for the purpose of stopping up gaps of ignorance.  The article also references the Boston Bomber debacle. That event was horrifying, and unforgivable, but people realized what had happened, and took steps to prevent it reoccurring. And I don't really know what that had to do with much of the rest of the article. I really don't think that it was only ""white, teenage boys"" partaking in the witch hunt. Were the authors illustrating the fact that Reddit can be harmful? Okay, fair enough. But it wasn't sexist. Was it racist? Look, I don't know. Probably some of it, but I don't think all the hundreds of people were uniformly white, nerdy, bigoted men. Women have been on the internet just as long, and we need to take some ownership of the things we might have been a part of. So the Red Pill wasn't ours. Obviously.

Now not only does half of society think I’m a nerd in a bad sense, the other now thinks of me as a sexist dick.   I grok your discomfort. Really. But — and I suggest this with all due gentleness — you have an opportunity for empathy in this discomfort.  Let me run a self-labelling sentence by you.  I am a Jew.  Does that last word jar in your ear at all? Depending on your age, upbringing and the socialising forces that acted upon you, there’s a good chance it does.  In English-speaking Christendom, the word has some profoundly unlovely associations. All of them thanks to bigotry and hatred, but the associations stick regardless of the worthiness of the source.  Those unlovely associations are a big reason why so many of us MoTs (Members of the Tribe) use the sentence ‘I’m Jewish’ when self-labelling in this fashion. ‘Jewish’ doesn’t carry the blood-soaked opprobrium that ‘Jew’ is burdened with.  But I am happy to call myself a Jew. In certain circumstances I’ll insist on it. Because all those horrific connotations are lies and slanders. And those lies and slanders were part of a quasi-mythic narrative that normalised the persecution and murder of my tribesfolk, up to and including the attempted (and appallingly close to successful) genocide of all of us, including all my kin except my parents and one grandparent.  And 2,000 years of murderous fucking bigots can go hang if they think I’m going to let them take my tribe’s name and turn into something other than ‘label for all these people over here, some of whom are wonderful and some of whom are awful and most of whom are nice enough but all of whom are here with me’.  As a ‘nerdy white man’, there aren’t — I suspect — a lot of times where you are prejudged harshly by a social structure that could (and, perhaps, will) exert dangerous power over you.  So, that unease you feel at being ‘lumped in with [those] assholes’?  You are absolutely right to feel aggrieved and appalled at the idea. It is an awful notion. It is unfair and unjust and dehumanising. And your unease is profound, awful and entirely sensible.  But — and again, I suggest this as gently and kindly as I possibly can — that awful feeling is also a window. It’s a taste of what marginalised folk of every stripe experience. And, depending on the place and time and the nature of said marginalisation, it’s a taste of what other people experience almost all the time, every day of their lives.  So, don’t feel less pissed off. But, perhaps, see this experience as a chance to get even more (and, I hope, more effectively) angry at the fucked-up structural inequities that mean millions of people live with that awfulness embedded deep into their everyday lives.  Oh, and yes, don’t let sub-editors off the hook either. I could quibble and argue ‘We must bulldoze what’s left of the MRAs’ and Gamergaters’ internet’ doesn’t quite capture the historical perspective Ryan Broderick was going for in his essay, but that doesn’t mean the title — as published — is the perfect title either."

Men became more likely to seek out richer partners with good jobs, because women providing for the family became more common. Before, many women would quit their job so it didn't matter so much if they had money.  The argument is this encouraged the rich to marry the rich even more than before.   Any thoughts on that? I definitely marriage and the way people tend to not marry outside socioeconomic class has a big contribution to wealth inequality."
FemmeThoughts,2x73n2,orangelace,3,Thu Feb 26 15:43:19 2015 UTC,"I think it does contribute to wealth inequality, but I would not like to go back to the way it was before - men objectified women for their youth/beauty and then women objectified men for their money.  I don't want to go back to that and all that entails women not being in the work force and not having agency i their lives because of that.  There may have been more economic equality back then but there was not as much equality within relationships ad between genders.  I think there are better solutions to the problem of wealth inequality.  Capitalism will do what it does (which is, eventually, to create huge economic inequalities) so the problem is capitalism, not gender relations"

Not respect, tenderness and vulnerability. It tells them that women don't want a kind, genuine person - that they want someone manipulative, someone hot and cold, who's constantly playing game. That they need to be always confident and in control, always the protector and never the protected. For many men, messages like this can stunt their ability to form healthy relationships, and crush their confidence in being open and genuine.   This is definitely not just 50shades. This notion of masculinity was already thriving out there, there's a reason that is the ideal the manosphere clings to -- and that many men have a degree of. I know that 50shades really doesn't do subtlety at all and it's more blatant than ever about this and the series is beyond redemption etc. etc., but there's still a little part of me that's maybe a bit peeved that this is brought up as soon as it's something popular with women as its target demographic.

Furthermore, while it may be possible to get some members of the privileged group on the side of a movement to lessen their advantage, it is not entirely likely. As Upton Sinclair put it; ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"" while that quote is an exaggeration of this case, the point still stands. While issues of equality are important, they will need to be branded in such a way as to actively encourage the participation of as many people as possible.

It wasn't saying that straight white men can't, as individuals, lead difficult lives - what it means is, they don't experience discrimination because they are straight white men. Secondly, whilst sex, race, and sexuality are often used in oppressive ways, they are by no means the only sources of oppression out there (again, as the article says). You also have poverty, social class, religion, and able-bodiedness as systems that act to oppress certain groups. In your case, as someone with a disability, the form of discrimination you would face is known as ableism, which can either be institutional in nature (for example, the world of work is designed around an assumption of able-bodiedness, which means that those with disabilities will face systemic barriers), or it may be individual in nature, such as when someone uses a disability as an insult. Ableism is something that a lot of feminists are very concerned with - on this sub, for example, there are a lot of accessibility rules to avoid discriminating against those with disabilities, such as the need to provide a transcript for any videos you post to avoid discriminating against those with audio-visual disabilities.  I'm really sorry about your condition, and as somebody who enjoys the privilege of being able-bodied, I am sure that your lived experience of the world is very different to mine as a result. However, playing oppression Olympics is beneficial to no one, and ignoring other privileges that you have simply contributes to the ongoing systemic discrimination that all marginalised groups face.

On the one hand she says:   So that's why it's not ""men's turn"" to have a social justice movement. That's why we have the fem in feminism. That's why fairness and equality involve promoting the empowerment of women, rather than promoting the empowerment of both genders in equal amounts.    Yet in the next paragraph she says:   So yes, let's talk about issues that affect men. Let's come up with solutions for problems that disproportionately hurt men, like suicide and homelessness and violent deaths (while at the same time recognizing that the fact that there are issues that affect more men than women does not mean that men are oppressed because of their gender).   Which seems like you would need some kind of social justice movement to address. Does she just not want to see a male-centered movement that is specifically based on misandry?"

It's a movement based on bullshit. You can very easily have a movement made by men who stand for these things under 'Feminism for men', because only by crushing the Patriarchy will you abolish the gender roles, biases and inequalities that affect them."
FemmeThoughts,2wtl0g,Shadow_x_Banned,25,Mon Feb 23 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"First off, we do understand that your comment is well-intended. However, there is one issue that we felt the need to point out:  You are correct to say that discrimination aimed towards men as a class isn't the same thing as systematic sexism against women as a class. However, discrimination against men is often (if not always) just the result of systematic sexism against women. The idea of men not being as good of a caretaker of children as women is an example of sexism against women having a negative effect on men. It's not inherently based on assumptions about men; rather, it is based on assumptions about women which just happen to also have a negative effect on men.   I understand that in common parlance, sexism is seen as ""discrimination against a person due to their sex"", regardless of whether the person being discriminated against is in a position of institutionalized power or not. You do try to explain the difference between discrimination faced by men and discrimination faced by women with   the difference is that sexism against men isn't systematic the way sexism against women is   which, kudos, you get points for! However, as I've stated earlier, discrimination against men is, for the most part, not inherently based off of assumptions about men, but about assumptions about women led to a ""logical"" conclusion.

But I do want to add that the author missed that scientific language (the formation, definition, and use of it), very much an aspect of scientific methods, is patriarchal and used in oppression, and was largely created by an oppressive class during an era when eugenics and thoughts of racial/ethnic/gender superiority were very common in society and among scientists."

FemmeThoughts,2wtj1w,BlitzNeko,1 point,Thu Feb 26 01:16:23 2015 UTC,"The author claims that it's bad researchers doing science who are the oppressors, not science itself.  For the most part, I agree, but science was built on a backbone of language and knowledge, all of which was formed and defined largely by a specific class of people who, historically, have had a tendency to use such knowledge and language to produce scientific results that benefited them at the oppression of others (and sometimes with that oppression in mind...think eugenics, which was only slowed in its popularity because it was socially bad form to have something in common with Hitler after WW2).  And while a lot of scientific knowledge gets rewritten and corrected over the years, the language largely remains the same, defined the same, and the corrections that are being done are not often in areas deemed in the realm of common sense. One doesn't need to be impeccably versed in Michel Foucault's works to understand how dangerous language can be when taken for granted.   Scientists often remain unaware of their own biases, and when their peers are equally unaware due to the scientific and academic process fostering a lack of critical thought, some aspects of science get taken for granted and go uninvestigated.   Which impacts scientific methods, scientific results, scientific languages, as well as the hypotheses and conclusions these scientists come to.  So it is not so easy as to say there are just some bad researchers doing oppression instead of science, when science itself promotes lack of critical thought into some of its core language and knowledge. We must also look at science, as it is constructed, and cast a more critical eye on how it influences oppression as well."

FemmeThoughts,2wq5te,TIGit,11,Sun Feb 22 16:15:15 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I absolutely believe this story belongs in r/FemmeThoughts. ‘Powerful people’ remains a strong synonym for ‘Powerful white straight men’. It’s not as absolute an equivalance as it was fifty or even ten years ago, but the exceptions remain rare. A powerful person might not be a powerful white straight man, but that’s still the way to bet.  That said, I like that Pfeffer’s article uses gender neutral language. The problem of powerful people not paying their due is a gendered problem today because of the structural inequities that mean white straight men are playing the game on the lowest difficulty setting as John Scalzi has noted more than once).  As said structures are remade, one useful test of the higher virtue of such remakings — to my mind at least — will be to find that, not only does power accrue to more and more people who aren’t white, straight and male, but that all of those with power are held to proper account, not just the powerful people who aren’t the old default.  Right now, one of my occasional but no-less-enraging-for-that frustrations is to watch one of the few powerful not-white, not-straight, not-males get taken down for a wrong-doing. It’s often the case that such folk did do something that should have consequences. It’s routinely the case, however, that they only face proper (if you will) consequences because they are not the ‘right’ colour or gender or sexuality to wield power unquestionably."
FemmeThoughts,2wmpq0,Adahn5,12,Sat Feb 21 05:33:58 2015 UTC,"This may sound kind of silly, but I think one thing that could really help male college parties safer is to lower the drinking age.   I'm not trying to derail or make this into a soapbox for another issue. But so much of drinking in college happens underground, hidden in unsafe venues, where no one is sober, older, or legally responsible for whatever happens. Because most drinking happens in the basement of a frat house there is no one to be held accountable if anything goes wrong.   A real bar or a university sponsered event, with a proper lisence, security cameras, bouncers, and some real legal responsibility would make something would be a billion times safer.   To make college parties safer, we need to have them in the open.   This could help a lot of things like alcohol posioning, but I definitely think it could help prevent sexual assault too."
FemmeThoughts,2wmpq0,hermithome,6,Sun Feb 22 00:00:25 2015 UTC,"It's not silly at all. I was born in Italy and the legal drinking age was 16. It was moved to 18 in 2012 (I had long since left) but yeah alcohol is just not a taboo. It's not something kids go sneaking about, engaging covert operations to get their hands on it, etc. And even before you even reach 16, you're used to drinking with your family. You start having sips of wine when you're eight years old, and by fourteen it's no big deal if you have a beer or two.  When I first travelled here to the US (to live, not on holiday) I was 19 and I had forgotten that the law is 21. When someone reminded me, you know what happened? I kid you not I instantly felt like drinking a beer. And I don't even like it! I hardly drink at all. I only drink during celebrations and things like that, and even then it's an accompaniment drink to be sociable.  But because I felt like someone was actively denying me something, I was like 'god damn it, I want a bloody drink >.>'  When I was studying Law at Lancaster University (this was in Lancashire, England) the campus had 4 bars. Full bars. They closed early, 10 pm, but you were in a controlled environment, among your peers, on campus, where you'd get cut off if you went over, and they had a whole campaign about it called 'Easy Tiger', where they'd tell you to pause for water or a soda in between your drinks.  These four places had exactly what you talked about, security cams, bouncers, and they were also run cooperatively by the students themselves and overseen by the student union. Getting back to your room was easy because again you were already on campus! xD"

Do you know how hard it is to get someone underage who's got alcohol poisoning to the ER? Everyone will do everything in their power to stop you.   I was pretty fortunate in that I had parents who said ""we'd prefer if you didn't do drugs or drink, but if you get in trouble, do not get into a friends car, don't drive yourself. Call us anytime, anywhere if you or a friend are in trouble.""  That said, raising the drinking age has done serious wonders for the numbers of serious drunk driving accidents.

FemmeThoughts,2wmz6p,ruchenn,8,Sat Feb 21 07:34:41 2015 UTC,"Not surprised at all. I think that academia is facing huge problems.  One of the biggest problem is that students assume that PhD is a step towards becoming a academic researcher when there are way more PhD and post doc opportunities than there are tenure track positions.   This also leads to the second problem that becoming a academic researcher is extremely competitive to the point it actually causes many talented people to abandon ship because the conditions are shit. Long working hours, uncertain employments, poor pay and very uncertain future. I personally know many brilliant scientists (with more than one nature publication) who opt out because of this.    As an example, I am a recently graduated PhD. I am good at what I do and encouraged to stay in science. I am tempted, but the conditions are as follows. I have to move abroad - at least once - before I can even stand a chance to get a temporary position in the country where I want to live in. Most likely I will have to keep moving every 2-5 yeras for the next 10 years, often with contracts lasting between 6 months to 2 years. As far as salary goes, one of great positions I was offered was paying 1000 euros LESS than what I earned as a PhD student. Another position in a top tier institution would give me an income of 45000$ annually. But in that particular city, I may not even be able to afford a studio apartment by myself. Now, add the ridiculous working hours to the mix and... all this isn't really that tempting.  I do love science, but I am not sure if all the above is worth it when there is a big chance I will end up with nothing. Yes. Even if I did all those things, there is no guarantee I will be employed once its done. I might have to change career plans despite everything sacrificed. I'm just not sure it is worth it in the long run.   EDIT: And of course, a lot of people seem unwilling to do anything about it because post docs tend to be rather cheap work force.

Things are now bad enough in academia that even men are giving up on the research life.  The tiny silver lining I’m trying to see? Now that things are hurting blokes to the extent it can’t be ignored any more, maybe steps will be taken to make it less awful for everyone.  And, yes, it’s beyond depressing that, if this is what happens, it will be yet another example of things not being considered real until men are aware of it or are affected by it. I’m so sick of this being the case I could scream. At this stage, however, and most especially with my eldest back in the post-graduate world this year (albeit part-time), I’ll take any way of improving things in academia I can get."
FemmeThoughts,2wlgzd,BabyMcHaggis,23,Fri Feb 20 22:30:37 2015 UTC,"When I was young I was all about this series.  These days, the Discworld books centred around Terry Pratchett's female characters (the Witches, Tiffany and the Nac Mac Feegles, Susan) make great reads.    In terms of movies, Baby Mama and The Heat spring to mind first.  Fried Green Tomatoes, Julie and Julia, and G.I. Jane would also make my list, along with The Affair Of The Necklace and Elizabeth.  Plus there's the old favourites like Mary Poppins, The Wizard of Oz, The Sound of Music and many animated Disney movies, like Pocahontas and Brave.  With TV shows, Broad City has some strong female leads and I find that Parks and Rec centres around Leslie.  The Vicar of Dibley is super old but I'm in love with it, same with Absolutely Fabulous and Strangers With Candy ft. Stephen Colbert is just in a league of its own.  Cupcake Girls gives an interesting portrayal and I enjoyed Bomb Girls for the same reason."

So I pulled them off one at a time and read the entire Alanna series.   Christmas came and went and the books stayed on the shelf. A few months later I asked about them.

And the female kidnap victim - stuck in a dry well but she ends up turning the tables on her kidnapper and gaining the upper hand. Not everyone's cup of tea but I think it's awesome.

Runner up is Paladin of Souls by Lois McMaster Bujold. It's a sequel to Curse of Chalion, but I think it's the strongest in the trilogy.

It's pretty great.  My other non-fiction feminist reads recommendations are:   Bitchfest (a collection of essays from Bitch magazine - just AWESOME) Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the rise of raunch culture by Ariel Levy (about how things like being the rap video girl is supposed to be empowering and why that's false) Temptress: From Original Bad Girls to Women on Top - a look at 'femme fatales' through history and how beautiful seductive women have been positioned as this 'dangerous' type of woman.   As far as fiction goes -   The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is absolutely beautiful. It is the story of Dinah and her 4 mothers - wives of Jacob from the Bible. Dinah is mentioned just in passing in the Bible, but this book draws on her story. It's a book about female relationships, more than anything else - women as mothers, daughters, friends, lovers, rivals. And also how there was shift from celebrating womanhood (shared experiences of childbirth and periods and whatnot) to making it seem something that was 'dirty'. It's one of my absolute favorite books, and I can't recommend it enough.  With movies, I'm a sucker for a good comedy so I love Bridesmaids and The Heat. And with TV shows, Buffy has always held a special place in my heart :D"

Shameless plug: I blogged about how Cashore created such interesting, different portrayals of femininity in her books.  I also love Gone with the Wind (the book).   Anything by Phillipa Gregory is good. She's most famous for The Other Boelyn Girl, but her books set during The Cousins' War are genius. I've only read the first three so far."

One thing that I love in general about Gregory's books is that she doesn't shy away from her protagonists' flaws. They're very well-rounded characters. In some cases, they're awful, but they're still relatable. Mary and Anne's relationship in The Other Boleyn Girl is one of my favourite depictions of a relationship between sisters ever written, even if it completely goes to shit by the end. Some of her characters are your more prototypical ""strong women,"" but I find they often work well within the constraints of their time periods nonetheless."

It's kind of an anthology about the only female werewolf (books 1 and 2), a witch who breaks from the only US coven to start her own (books 3 and 4), a ghost who just wants to fix her life and see her daughter be brought up well without a mother (book 5),  etc.  Kim Harrison's The Hollows are easily one of my favorite series ever. It's about a witch who is a bounty hunter who lives with a pixy and a blood-abstaining vampire. It's jam packed with action, sex, and excitement.   Then, there's also the Stardoc series, about a thoracic surgeon who leaves Earth to practice on a planet at the edge of the solar system.

After Edison has more than overstayed his welcome, Fletcher delivers his wife an ultimatum: It’s him or me.  Rich with Shriver’s distinctive wit and ferocious energy, Big Brother is about fat: an issue both social and excruciatingly personal.

If it ever gets out of new, I'll be dead. :D    EDIT: The comments section got pretty well nuked, but it also got linked on /r/drama and /r/subredditdrama, which means that there are some snapshots available. Here's the /r/drama thread, and here's the /r/subredditdrama thread.  Note though that most of the removed comments were not misogynistic, but feminist. Everyone on this thread has been assuming that the deleted comments were so anti-feminist and arseholish that the mods removed them. Not at all. In fact, it's rather the opposite. Take a look at this screenshot and compare it to the current thread. To help, I've used red squares for removed comments in the screenshot and green for ones that were allowed to stay up. The comments allowed to stay were 1) that was derailing, 2) claimed I was what was wrong with feminism and 3) tone policed feminists and said that feminism had to be about convincing people. Whereas all of the removed comments were supporting feminism. They point out that the anti-feminists were derailing, they talked about the difficulties with anti-feminist discourse on the internet, the pointed out where the anti-feminist commenters were wrong, or asked them to back up their statements. And well, there's a comment from me that's removed where I'm laughing at a troll. This is how moderation works there. The trolls are left to troll, and women and feminists have their comments removed for not being nice enough to the trolls.   For example, /u/PM_ME_UR_GROSSKREUTZ had all of their comments removed and was banned. But here's a screenshot of their removed comments - they were removed and then banned for not being nice enough to the anti-feminists. /u/BabyMcHaggis, who was the OP of the post here also had a tonne of their comments removed.   EDIT2: /u/anisaerah who was also rocking it in the comments section also had all of their comments removed and were banned as well - for telling a ""guy who was calling people cunts to go fuck himself""."

FemmeThoughts,2wfri1,hermithome,6,Thu Feb 19 20:41:01 2015 UTC,"To be fair, (speaking as a mod), a lot of subs nuke comment sections as soon as they get linked to meta subs. It's just to avoid further drama and brigading. It's especially common in subs that have small mod teams that probably can't handle going through comment-by-comment. The fact that comments were removed, and which comments were, may not be indicative of any kind of agenda (unless they were selectively removed, of course)   That said, 2X is toxic as fuck, so I wouldn't really put anything past them at this point. It's basically become a sub for dudes to yell about/at women, on issues that don't affect them."
FemmeThoughts,2wfri1,Leagle_Egal,13,Fri Feb 20 04:49:43 2015 UTC,"Except that actually doesn't explain most of the removals. Sure, some come from meta subs, but a lot of the posters came from twox to the meta subs, not the other way around. And the comments weren't removed for brigading. The users were banned for not being nice enough to arsehole misogynists.   Lots of the really early comments were nuked quickly. The mods knew I wasn't brigading, I was the OP. Same with a lot of early commenters before it went meta. And we got nuked anyway for not being nice enough."
FemmeThoughts,2wfri1,hermithome,3,Fri Feb 20 04:57:26 2015 UTC,"Well that's disappointing then, I'm sorry. I admit I haven't read through all the archived posts/screenshots, so I wasn't sure. I just very frequently see people jumping all over mods for comment removals that are perfectly reasonable in context (not in this sub specifically, just in general), and it always kind of irks me. For example, I've personally had people flip out on me when I removed their comments, even though I agreed with them. It's just that I had to remove them because I removed comments from the person they were arguing against, so it would have just confused others if all they could see was one side of the heated argument that was happening, and could potentially just reignite another argument.   Sadly that's not the case here, it would seem. Sad to see the mods are not just allowing this kind of toxic takeover, but are actively encouraging it all in the name of ""being nice/welcoming."" As though men on reddit need yet another space where they are pandered to."
FemmeThoughts,2wfri1,Fairleee,3,Fri Feb 20 05:04:25 2015 UTC,"I just very frequently see people jumping all over mods for comment removals that are perfectly reasonable in context (not in this sub specifically, just in general), and it always kind of irks me.   Oh absolutely. Anti-mod circle jerk is HUGE on reddit. I find it super annoying too. We've got the same issue here. We've had people who we've removed their comments or banned them get really angry and try and convince people that we're evil and banned them for ridiculous reasons. It happens in every sub and it sucks.  But that's not at all what happens here. The mods have always had this niceness requirement for women and feminists. There's a very detailed warning of the sub written up in the related sub list, and copied into a comment elsewhere on this thread. Their rules are pretty awful. And what's worse is how misleading they are about it."

FemmeThoughts,2wfri1,beckoning_cat,3,Thu Feb 19 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"What was the general gist? That it didn't go downhill, or it was downhill before it got defaulted?"
FemmeThoughts,2wfri1,obscurityknocks,17,Thu Feb 19 21:26:45 2015 UTC,"Downhill before, but going default killed it off. Here's a quote from the warning section of the related subreddits list that we maintain:   /r/TwoXChromosomes  - Mods focus more on tone-policing then cleaning up mansplaining and trolling. Users who argue with the MRAs who troll the sub often have their comments remove and are warned or banned for hostility. They even have a ""no misandry"" policy, which dates back to 2010 (see snapshots for 18/02/2010 and 01/03/2010). The tagline for the community has been ""You are the community. You have all the power of the internet to mold it."" off and on for the past few years. That is, moderators take a hands-off approach. The power of the internet is the power only of the average user: a voice and a vote. In mid 2014, twox became a default subreddit, which has made things worse. (screenshot from redditmetrics)  In response to the recent petition on blackladies, asking reddit to do something about the huge racism problem they deal with, 2x not only refused to co-sign the letter but gave this comment to a reporter doing a story on the petition:   “Racism and bigotry are highly complex problems that cannot be solved with the signing of a letter, or a website policing its users, or giving the trolls a spotlight. We are patently disinterested,” subreddit co-founder HiFructoseCornFeces explained. “Growing up means realizing that combating evil does not mean spending all of your energy stamping out every last flicker of fuckery, but in issuing forth genuine goodness whole-heartedly and with resonance.”   link   Yes, that's right. The top mod for 2x considers racism, a ""flicker of fuckery"". They think that working to fight against brigades from white supremacist hate subs and protect your users is childish. That the mods should just grow up and focus on being good. Because if they're good, maybe the hate groups abusing the community and its users will be touched and just stop on their own. In 2x, this attitude is why MRAs aren't banned, but the women who tell them to fuck off are.  This is not new. This is not an accident. This is not a result of ""going default"". This is the type of community that the moderators want."
FemmeThoughts,2wfri1,Fairleee,3,Fri Feb 20 02:27:25 2015 UTC,Thanks! I've been wondering about that sub. Now I know to 1). not take it seriously & 2) unsubscribe.

You will find every type of antifeminist the author identifies represented there. It's also amusing (and again, by amusing, I mean head-bangingly frustrating) to see so many ""equalists""/""egalitarians"" making comments like, ""well, if caring about equal rights issues like alimony and bias in family law makes me an asshole, then I guess I'm an asshole"", and still not see even after reading the article that, if you claim to be about ""equality"", but only care about a few, cherry-picked issues where men appear to be treated worse (and I use the term ""appear"" carefully, because whilst there are instances of bias against men, in general these issues are far more nuanced than cherry-picked statistics would have you believe, as the root cause of them is often patriarchal in nature), then you aren't interested in equality at all.

The people who want to say that sexism is a thing of the past and we don't need feminism anymore really have their work cut out for them in overlooking this issue."
FemmeThoughts,2wg3d2,BeeSilver9,29,Thu Feb 19 17:51:53 2015 UTC,"That's seriously disturbing. I wonder how many men know the historical basis for the last-name-taking - that women and wives were once considered property, and having the last name of the husband signified that she 'belonged' to him (in an ownership sense, not a Nicholas Sparks sense). I wonder also if it would make a difference knowing that."
FemmeThoughts,2wg3d2,vagued,27,Thu Feb 19 19:30:36 2015 UTC,"I recently met someone who I was/am hoping to be friends with (trying to make friends in the area). Her wedding is in a few months. She seems like a lot of fun and we have been getting along great. One of our first conversations, she mentions how she's taking her fiance's last name because he was ardent about it. They had not discussed it before getting engaged, and he basically threatened the engagement over it. I don't really know the guy at all. Made me feel really awkward because I was trying to make a friend so I didn't want to offend her by slamming her fiance. But I really wanted to call him a backwards asshole who she shouldn't marry if he'd threaten that."

I ended up posting an article to FB with my commentary to see how he responded.

The type of women who rebel against this are not the type of women I want.   Interesting."
FemmeThoughts,2wg3d2,LadyAntipathy,2,Fri Feb 20 15:36:54 2015 UTC,I find the first one a bit bizarre as well. There are plenty of good reasons to take someone else's name. Maybe your family was abusive and you're estranged from them and don't want to carry their name around. Maybe your last name sounds terrible and you dislike it. Maybe you've always wanted to own a bookstore and the person you're dating has a last name that would be perfect on your store front.  I get what he intends to say: that he wants someone with their own sense of identity and who is unwilling to drop it just because a man asks her too. But the absolutely comes out a bit harsher than that.
FemmeThoughts,2wg3d2,Crustal_Math,14,Fri Feb 20 22:24:06 2015 UTC,"Well, that's probably because /r/askmen is a shithole riddled with MRA and redpill dudebros."

Once when being introduced to a group of women all 50-65, the hostess asked me what my ""married name is now."" I was surprised. ""Oh, I didn't change it."" This group of women cheered and clapped. That was doubly surprising. They were all married, many had grand kids, and they all had changed their names.  A few months later, I helped a friend's conservative family paint their deck, and extended relatives were over. When someone else mentioned I hadn't changed my name, one aunt and uncle made a point of telling me it was not normal and was a bad thing that I didn't change my name. Thanks for the life advice, acquaintances whose names I forgot."

He's been supportive of whatever she wants to do, but she can't decide. She wants to keep her name, but also wants to take his. She's white, he's Asian, she doesn't want to have to deal with people being confused or thinking she's somehow stealing someone's ID. She wants to keep her middle name, but hyphenating seems like too much. She's at a loss. We keep asking ""If there were no social stigma to keeping your last name, what would you decide?""   She still doesn't know. The wedding is in one week. IDK!  I took his name when I got married and I kept it when we divorced. Mostly because I hated my maiden name, didn't feel attached to it and think my new name sounds pretty badass. Were I ever to get married again, I don't know that I'd change it. It would have to be a seriously cool name for me to consider.  Martha Gail Asskicker or Martha Gail Dickmaster. Martha Gail Queenoftheuniverse."

My maiden name wasn't ever a huge part of my identity and it turns out I feel more like a part of his family than I ever did with mine.

One of my cousins did the same a few years later (without a divorce, just a name change) I think it goes to show that neither of us have a good relationship with our fathers  :/  If my partner and I ever get married, I'd only change my name again if we both hyphenated or combined to make a new name."

I was on the stationary bike when he said it and it was almost enough to get me off the bike and to the computer so I could tweet him live about how those 'hot girls' suffer just as much as any other women. In fact, they are oppressed in other ways. Such as not being taken seriously precisely because every accomplishment they make is immediately assumed to be due to their looks, such as being considered incompetent because they're 'bimbos' or (my favourite >.>) that if they got to where they are it was because they performed sexual favours to get there.

FemmeThoughts,2wbabh,KITTEHZ,5,Thu Feb 19 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"This is really sad to me.  I've had great male and female professors, but the ones who really inspired me were my female professors - especially my Calculus professor.    She didn't teach an easy class by any measure, but she was incredibly smart and she made sure we learned the material.  She also took time to get to know each student; at the beginning of the semester she had all of us fill out a questionnaire about ourselves, which we had to hand in during her office hours.    Her Calc II class was so great that I made sure I had her as my professor when I signed up for Calc III.  When I handed in my questionnaire at the beginning of the semester, she talked to me about it while she read it, asking me questions about my interests and hobbies.  Then she got to the part about my major - Chemistry.  She asked me if I had ever considered majoring in Math.  She said she'd noticed me in her Calc II class, and she thought I had a real aptitude for the subject.  It dawned on me that I hadn't even considered majoring in Math, even though it had always been my favorite subject.  It only took me a second to realize that Math was what I wanted to do.  Right then and there, she changed my life.  So if any of you ladies are professors, know that you do make a difference in the lives of your students.  It's so important for girls and women to have real, live role models who we can look up to.  Double standards like this make me livid, because you all are amazing."

I hope more people catch on to how flimsy and fluid sex categories and traits can be, so that there's less stigma and scrutiny against those who are intersex and trans.

If women have significantly higher rates of  blatant markers of their heritage, and are somehow 'out on the streets' more often--this makes this somewhat less disheartening.

FemmeThoughts,2w8645,sinfunnel,3,Wed Feb 18 05:52:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like this article is not giving the full story. I'm going to give it a try and summarize what is happening.  First and most important thing to note : Laïcité is a corner stone of France. It is incredibly difficult to explain to foreigners but it is a valid and strong concern here. I'm insisting on it because this key concept was vastly used by both sides of the debate. Since the 80's hijab has been seen as a problem for various reasons, among them laïcité, women rights and lets be honest islamophobia. (As to why there is such a rampant islamophobia in France well, that's another debate).  With that in mind : In 2004 the previous (right wing) government passed a law forbidding all visible signs of religion inside public schools. Because a public school is 'laïque' it was argued that any visible sign of religion is proselytism and should be banned. Some teenagers wearing hijab were asked to remove them and refused and were temporary excluded from their school. The debate became national and people are still to this day arguing if hijab is a religious sign or not.  In 2011 the same government passed a law banning people from hiding their face in public places. No one was fooled. This law was aiming at outlawing niqab without daring to say so. This law saw support from numerous corners. Broadly speaking the left was for it because they are against religions, the right was for it because they have a problem with Islam. Plus Laïcité. It is also important to note that many vocal feminists were supporting it.  Their main argument was that women who are wearing niqab are forced by their fundamentalist husbands to do so. By outlawing it, France will help these poor women.  It is to note that all these laws were passed by a government aiming to seduce the far right for the 2011 presidential election.  In a nutshell in the last 10 years Islam was used as a political argument by the right-wing. People have now associated niqab and hijab with fundamentalism i.e terrorism.  Obviously I'm not trying to justify these acts of violence. I justed wanted to point out why niqab or hijab wearing women are more in danger now.  As to why French feminists are mostly silent ... well the most vocal French feminist groups seems unable to overcome their anti-religious bias it seems."
FemmeThoughts,2w8645,LapinAleph,1 point,Wed Feb 18 11:31:31 2015 UTC,"Laïcité:       French secularity (French: laïcité, pronounced [laisite]) is the absence of religious involvement in government affairs as well as absence of government involvement in religious affairs.   French secularism has a long history but the current regime is based on the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State.  During the twentieth century, it evolved to mean equal treatment of all religions, although a more restrictive interpretation of the term has developed since 2004.  Dictionaries ordinarily translate laïcité as secularity or secularism (the latter being the political system),  although it is sometimes rendered in English as laicity or laicism by its opponents. While the term was coined in 1871 in the dispute over the removal of religious teachers and instruction from elementary schools, the term laïcité dates to 1842.     Image i - Motto of the French republic on the tympanum of a church, in Aups (Var département) which was installed after the 1905 law on the Separation of the State and the Church.

FemmeThoughts,2w8t5b,hermithome,7,Wed Feb 18 00:10:47 2015 UTC,"I also wanted to know if there are specific ways to screen the baddies out first   This isn’t foolproof, but I’ve found it useful.  Pay attention to how they treat:   People they have power over (eg wait staff in a restaurant or counter staff in a shop). People who can’t provide them with things they want (eg someone they get introduced to at a work do who isn’t ‘worth’ networking with because they can’t help them get ahead in their job or career).   If they treat people they have power over as vassals and people who aren’t useful to them as supernumeraries, walk away, as politely but as quickly as you can.  Treating people you have power over or people who aren’t, perhaps, the people you want to meet right now with decency and courtesy isn’t automatically a sign they are your moral and ethical match. But it’s an important step in the right direction nonetheless.  If nothing else, paying this sort of attention helps me weed out the narcissistic but charming from the genuine and decent.  FWIW, and since u/hermithome mentioned men in particular, I put Nice Guys — with the appropriate Initial Caps Signalling in place — into the ‘narcissistic but charming’ category. Whenever I hear someone describe themselves as a Nice Guy, I instantly hear Bernadette Peters singing:   You’re so nice. You’re not good, You’re not bad, You’re just nice. I’m not good, I’m not nice, I’m just right. I’m the witch. You’re the world. — ‘Last Midnight’, from Into the Woods, music and lyric by Stephen Sondheim, book by James Lapine."

Getting a chance to hang with someone (especially a guy) and their friends tells you a lot about them. Maybe the man you're interested in doesn't crack sexist jokes. But if he hangs out with friends that do, that tells you a lot. Maybe the man you're interested in isn't a creepy guy. But if he's in a circle of friends that has some creepy dudes, especially if he defends them and is one of the people who invites them places: that tells you a lot."
FemmeThoughts,2w6qcx,goodoldfreda,55,Tue Feb 17 12:30:36 2015 UTC,"""Hormonal"" is one that annoys me every time. It's used as a proxy for ""emotional"", but semantically what is happening with it is far more pernicious; it is attempting to root our experience and interpretation of female emotionality in a biotruth - women are emotional because their bodies make them be so, because of all their hormones. It's such a load of crap, because firstly, men absolutely have hormones as well. Everyone does, they play vital roles in our biology. We'd be dead without them. And secondly, it genders biology; oestrogen is no longer just a hormone typically found in higher concentrations in women than in men, but it becomes a feminine thing, and is therefore responsible for women being emotional, and irrational etc. Seriously, why is it ok to say that an angry woman (regardless of how justified her emotional state is) is being hormonal, but we would not say that about a man? Especially when you consider that testosterone, a hormone typically found in higher concentrations in men, is linked with aggressive behaviour. The fact that we would use the word to apply to women, but not to men, just shows how gendered it is, and how it is used to control women - if a woman is angry, or upset, and it is attributed to her being hormonal, then it de-legitimises her emotional state, because it suggests she isn't in control of herself, but presumably whenever a man gets angry or upset, it is a logical, rational response to the situation at hand.  The fact is, we're all just walking bags of chemicals, and we are all influenced by chemistry. The way that we only consider one sex to be controlled by our biochemistry shows the extent to which this is a gendered problem."

FemmeThoughts,2w6qcx,hermithome,10,Tue Feb 17 16:47:33 2015 UTC,"That's a bit different. I mean, yes, it's still dismissive as fuck, just not in the same way.  If there's a direct comparison between the way we say this to teens, and the way we say it to women, it's pregnant women, especially when giving birth.   But that's a totally different situation then how women are treated daily. The idea of ""emotional"" or ""hormonal"" women is that nothing we feel is legitimate and therefore whatever we feel can be dismissed. If whatever someone feels isn't legitimate, then you never have to worry about hurting them. It's also has a direct tie to our competence. Any opinion, or statement by a woman can be dismissed as invalid because they are a woman, and those hormones/emotions are making them say that.   This is the complete opposite from how we treat men. Men who are angry or upset are justified in their feeling. We respect their anger and their passion, even if it's totally and completely inappropriate - or worse, dangerous. And when they reveal ""softer"" emotions, they're often praised for being vulnerable.   The default state is that men's emotions are justified and legitimate, and women's aren't."
FemmeThoughts,2w6qcx,hermithome,3,Tue Feb 17 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"When it comes to public figures - celebs, idols, etc. I agree. However, from my experience at school, certainly back then it was still taught that if you revealed any softness you were at best ""weak"", and at worst a ""faggot"" or some other lovely epithet. The only exception to this were those at the top of the food chain, but even then, it was a constant balance between retaining your ""peak specimen"" status, and becoming too effeminate to be useful (which again, reinforces the whole ""top of the food chain immunity"" thing that celebs etc have going for them).    Yeah, good point. Whether or not male emotions are considered acceptable often depends on how masculine the person in question is perceived: both physically and how well they perform masculinity. This is especially true in school."

FemmeThoughts,2w6qcx,hermithome,6,Tue Feb 17 22:21:07 2015 UTC,"No, it really doesn't seem like I'm saying that, because I didn't say anything like that. I explicitly said that it was still ""dismissive as fuck"", just in a different way.   For starters, referring to teens as ""hormonal"" generally isn't used to undermine their competence. Lots of other age related things are, no doubt, but ""hormonal"" or ""emotional"" generally isn't. For example, if a woman gives a presentation on something, super minor things like her tone of voice, or her looks or whatever, can be used to label her as ""shrill"" or ""emotional"" - even if she's presenting a factual presentation and not acting emotionally at all.  This doesn't happen to teens, at least not male teens. Their age can absolutely still be used to undermine their competence, but a charge of ""emotional"" or ""hormonal"" rarely is.   A charge of ""hormonal"" is mostly used to dismiss teenagers emotions and rarely used to dismiss their opinions or overall competence. They absolutely still face age-related discrimination, and their competence and opinions are dismissed, but rarely because they're perceived as ""hormonal"" and mostly because they are perceived as too young to know anything.  The best analogy I can come up with when comparing the way ""hormonal"" is used to dismiss teenagers' emotions is a pregnant woman giving birth. People just nod along and assume that they don't really mean it and that they'll come around shortly. Yes, it's still very dismissive. And yes, it does play into other issues with how teenagers are treated due to age. But the gendered usage of the term isn't equivalent to the age usage. There are significant differences in terms of how they are used, how effective they are and what other issues they play into.  Please don't characterise a comment as saying the exact opposite as what I actually said again. That's not cool."

It's the same way that women face greater sexism entering male dominated fields.  But a teenage girl making a school presentation to her class may be seen as shrill, emotional or hormonal because of her gender, in way that a teenage boy wouldn't be. To say that the dismissal of youth as ""hormonal"" is equivalent to the dismissal of women as ""hormonal"" is to ignore that these are different issues, and that they can overlap and intersect.  For teens, this issue intersects with several other age discrimination issues and practices. In the same way that a woman's appearance may affect how people perceive her, how physically adult a teenager is does as well. A 16 year old boy that looks like a grown man is going to get a different response then a 16 year old boy that looks like a child. And a 16 year old girl that looks like a woman is going to get a different response than a 16 year old girl that looks like a child. And for the girl, that response is going to involve both age-related issues and gender-related issues.  You're looking at one specific arena, but that's just one facet of the larger picture. You have how teenagers are perceived in school, at home, and out in the professional world. How parents, teachers, peers, and  adults treat them is going to vary wildly. And gender is going to play a part in that as well.   I'm not dismissing the issues that youths face, I'm simply pointing out that they aren't equivalent."

No, that would only be an equivalent comparison if women only faced these sorts of gendered attitudes when they were in male-dominated spaces. But women face this sort of gendered attitudes everywhere - even in women dominated spaces.   You seem to be unable or unwilling to grasp the concept of intersectionality. All discrimination is not equivalent. It's important to understand different types of discrimination and how they interact with other types. You're trying to draw an equivalence between the way terms like ""hormonal"" and ""emotional"" are used to silence and dismiss women, and how they are used to silence and dismiss teens. And while there is some similarity, they aren't equivalent, and understanding the unique aspects of each is important. You keep focusing on one narrow arena and insisting that because it has so many similarities, it's equivalent. And whenever I try and point out that that is only one arena, and that there are many others, and that teenage girls face silencing due to borh age and gender, you ignore that and insist on doubling down."

See here:   88% of women she spoke to who had a BPD label were adult survivors of childhood abuse. source   Depression morbidity is cited as anywhere from 70% to ""virtually everybody"".  ""Borderline personality disorder"" should be disolved and reclassified as two disorders: a type of depression or symptoms of depression and something similar to CPTSD. It's no coincidence how the reaction associated with women is classified as a personality disorder while PTSD/C-PTSD/depression definitely aren't."

Somehow, describing a mixed-gender group using a male word is fine, but an all-female group is not, nor is describing an all-male or mixed-gender group using a female word fine. Perhaps this is because male is considered generic and desireable: it's fine for a woman to be manly, but not a man to be womanly.

FemmeThoughts,2w6vky,SheilaNOOOO,6,Tue Feb 17 17:37:26 2015 UTC,"""One of the reasons why the stock image rape victim’s face is obscured might simply be down to practicalities. With inexperienced or poor quality models who often fill the books of stock image photographers, they might be more used to creating scenes of them laughing with salad, or reproducing the basic poses that form the stock image catalogue. The image of the rape victim is by far one of the most emotionally complex ones for both model and photographer to recreate. Perhaps some feel its better to show no facial expression at all, then go for complex emotions and botch them with a poor model and this leads them to obscure the face to avoid taking that risk.""   That's a bit needlessly derisive, but it's also just plain incorrect. For stock photography, most licenses restrict using the images in a way that implies that the model has a personal connection to a sensitive issue, or is in some way connected to or endorsing a product, opinion or event. In other words, if you use a stock photo in a way that makes it look like the model is the actual rape victim, you're not using that image legally.

FemmeThoughts,2vxf5t,Paigeebee,8,Sun Feb 15 01:03:22 2015 UTC,"As an atheist, I’m kinda disappointed in the atheist movement’s silence on feminist issues.   The ‘atheist movement’, to the extent the phrase has meaning, is primarily a White, Middle-Class Male, Anglophone and mostly American movement. This movement is also, at least in my limited experience, mostly a reactionary one, responding to aggressive Protestant Fundamentalism (which is also mostly White, Middle-Class, Male, Anglophone and, again, mostly American).  Given this, its not, to me at least, especially surprising the movement hasn’t said or contributed much to the question of gender and sexual equality.   It seems the two would make natural allies.   I’m not sure they are natural allies. Feminism is a broad and complex collection of ideas and people centred around the idea that 1) equal treatment for all humans is a fundamental requirement and 2) the maltreatment of women, especially, is a core problem preventing us from attaining this basic requirement. I’d go a touch further and argue that Feminism is also the intellectual tradition from which much of our insight regarding structural biases and prejudices has arisen.  Assuming my characterisation above is accurate, the ‘atheist movement’ is mostly well-off White Males arguing with other well-off White Males, mostly in English, and mostly within the United States.  That’s not a recipe for instant alliance with Feminism, even allowing for Anglophone feminism being predomininatly White, Middle-Class and Female.  FWIW, and perhaps most annoying, from an outsider’s perspective at least, is the extent to which this primarily White, Middle-Class, Male and Anglophone ‘movement’ conflates atheism (absence of religious belief) with anti-theism (opposition to religious belief and practice).  In parts of the United States where Fundamentalist Protestantism has political, social and economic hegemony, public non-belief can be socially, politically and economically costly. So long as the primary public face of non-belief in the United States has the mocking and condescending tone of places such as r/atheism, they won’t be of any use to US-based folk facing such costs.  In most places with high levels of reported non-belief or irreligion (eg Norway, Eastern Germany and South Korea), atheism isn’t a movement, its just a kind of default or near-default position.   If you’re an atheist, how to you perceive the atheist community in relation to feminist issues?   I’m an atheist for all normal values of the word G_d. I don’t think the atheist community, as denoted by me above, is of much use when it comes to feminist issues. They are too busy fighting imaginary bogey men to be of much use to the people in the US who are harmed by hegemonic Christianity.  In this regard they remind me of most MRAs. There are (a few) harms being suffered mostly by blokes in the industrialised West, and the men suffering those harms could do with thoughtful, well-organised help and support. MRAs are way too busy attacking the shibboleth that is supposed ‘hegemonic Feminism’ to be of any help to these suffering men.   How do you perceive the religious community in relation to feminist issues?   There is no more a religious community than there is a right-handed community or an American community. There isn’t even, really, a US-centric Protestant Fundamentalist community (which is what I’m inferring you mean by ‘religious community’), although it occasionally feels like they are a unified coherent whole to us out here in the rest of the world.  Given that, I’m not sure you can say anything useful about the relationship between this imaginary community and something as complex as Feminism.   If you’re religious   I’m not religious but I am observant. Again, the incipient anti-theism of US-centric atheists is annoying in this regard. It conflates social ritual actions with an overt religious or spiritual aspect with belief, and ridicules them all without any awareness of the way it makes their attack look stupid and pointless.   what religion are you?   I’m Jewish, specifically a Reconstructionist Jew. It’s worth noting that Reconstructionist Judaism is, for practical purposes, religious practice and observance without a diety. Atheist religion, if you will.   What do your god/gods/holy books/leaders say in relation to feminist issues?   The Tanach, the Talmud and other books say all sorts of fucked up things about women. They also say all sorts of fucked up things about men and children and the stars and Pi. But its important to note that women are particularly ill-served by all sorts of crap that comes out of Jewish scripture.  That said, no religion is just the scriptures and commentaries that constitute its literary basis. Atheists who keep insisting that all [people denoted by this particular religious label] must believe [this particular outrageous thing recorded in said religion’s scripture] only reveal how profoundly ignorant of Anthropology they are.  My own response to the fucked up nature of much of the Tanach, and the response of pretty much all the people I share my religious practice and observance is, for example: so what?  Our religion is, like all In Group marking mechanisms, a semi-arbitrary collection of shared habits, tropes, rules, experiences, stories and rituals. They aren’t better or worse than yours, but they are ours. And they aren’t bound by the words in our scriptures any more than they are bound by the actions of our forebears. Influenced by those words and actions? Of course. But to argue we’re bound by them is the sort of rank Essentialism, even Fundamentalism, that makes it all too easy to see US-centric, publicly-active Atheists as intellectual lightweights with too much time on their hands.  My particularly Jewish cultural habits and norms and practices work for me because they are shared with others who’s experience I also share. It’s got nothing to do with their supposed connection to an invisible deity. These practices bind us into a community because we can — when we meet — drop into short hands of expression and communication that make our meetings more meaningful than meetings with folks who don’t share our cultural norms.  In my particular case, being observant is also a profoundly political act. It’s a life-long Fuck You to the murderous bastards who slaughtered my grandparents and only didn’t kill my parents because they escaped (my mother) or were hidden (my father).  Every single time I say a prayer to a G_d I know can’t hear me, I’m keeping alive the lives and memories of the millions of my tribe who were murdered simply because they were members of my tribe.  Which is, perhaps, why I find the anti-theism of the so-called ‘atheist movement’ so objectionable. When anti-theists go on a rant about the evils of religious practice they sound so much like every other demagogue who’s decided that me and my people should just not exist as to make no difference between them and everyone else who’s tried to wipe us out us for the last 2,000 years."
FemmeThoughts,2vxf5t,ruchenn,5,Mon Feb 16 06:32:01 2015 UTC,"I'm technically not an atheist, I'm agnostic, but people treat me like I'm an atheist, so I suppose I fit the bill enough.   I think there's no real atheist movement or community, to be perfectly honest, at least in the so-called ""western world"". Or, at least not one that is representative of the majority of atheists. And I think the vast majority of atheists are unorganized and don't consider themselves part of an atheist community  What little ""community"" that exists tends to pride themselves on their elitism of being ""free"" from ""religious brainwashing"" and holding to a more ""objective truth"". These people often see themselves as superior and scientifically minded, even if their practice doesn't hold up to that. Key example being ""The Amazing Atheist"" and ""thunderf00t"" (I don't know their real names), two large atheist figureheads a stage below Dawkins and co. These two have pushed for scientific evidence, promoted skepticism, and whatnot in their debates with creationists, yet throw all of that aside whenever they find themselves weighing in on topics like racism, classisn, feminism, LGBT rights, etc., often filling their arguments with sensationalistic strawmen in order to, again, make themselves look good and superior, and their 'opponents' entirely deserving of mockery.  This group, IMO, gives atheism a bad name due to how often they declare social justice and feminist claims as unscientific (often without even understanding scientific experimentation or statistical methods in the first place) and worthy of mockery and opposition, labeling such agents of progression as detriments to society.   I know a lot of atheists, and the vast, vast majority are really cool, but none of them deem their lack of faith as a rallying point. Those who have, over the past decade, tend to have a chip on their shoulders and feel justified in harassing others due to being in a 'minority group' themselves.   So the uncoordinated atheists? They're more likely (by my anecdotal experiences) to be the type to rally around other issues like feminism and other forms of social justice, and I've encountered and worked with many in my forays into activism. Those who are loud and proud (and often aggressive) atheists who use their lack of faith as a means to taunt and harm others in a false show of superiority? Not all that different from white supremacists in how they operate (not saying these atheists ARE white supremacists, but they seem to have similar principles regarding faith/religion and other cultural issues as WSers did with race and class and whatnot), so definitely not the type to help out. There WAS a so-called ""Atheism+"" mini-community that branched off from the aforementioned atheists and declared that social justice activism in all forms is key to progressing freedom of/from religion, but they're generally hated by the much larger contingency of angry, unhelpful atheists who largely treat them as ""white knights"" and ""brainwashed idiots"", etc.  In contrast, I also don't see a lot of support for feminism through religious groups, though again, I'm just pulling from experience. Every church and religious group in my hometown was staunchly anti-feminist, and I haven't come across any religious organizations here in Ottawa that are openly helpful, outside of occasional church members and organizers offering rare, occasional support. They're generally never openly hateful or even positioned in opposition, but they generally aren't helpful unless they can advance some sort of agenda (which, suppose, is expected, and fair enough, even if some of those goals of theirs are anti-feminist)."
FemmeThoughts,2vxf5t,lockedge,4,Mon Feb 16 00:25:53 2015 UTC,"The problem with Atheism (I'm an Agnostic Atheist myself) is that it says nothing about your political ideology, personal philosophy, ethics, morals or economic leanings. r/Atheism for instance is a den of reactionary, islamophobic, racist scumbags and everyone should unsub from that hole and instead sub to /r/Atheismplus which adds a healthy dose of Social Justice, and is strictly moderated. Essentially it provides what /r/FemmeThoughts does for /r/Femminism and fights back against its defaultification.  In any event, Atheists can be Capitalists, they can be Neo-Nazis, they can be pretty much anything under the sun. Of course they can also be thoughtful, intelligent, contentious people. They can be Anarchists, Marxist-Leninists, Social-Democrats, or be completely a-political.   If you're an atheist, how to you perceive the atheist community in relation to feminist issues?   Because of the above, I don't really think it's much of a community, since the only thing tying us together is that we reject the baseless assertion that a supernatural deity exists. It would be the same as saying that everyone who doesn't believe in Unicorns is a community.  But for the sake of furthering the argument, I'll say that I perceive it as being bad at least here on Reddit, and most places online, because it's primarily a space for white, relatively well-off males to voice their dissent against anything they perceive to be an affront to their pseudo-intellectual prowess. So of course they bash feminism, they bash theists, they bash multiculturalism, animal rights, environmental justice, and they display a healthy dose of homophobia and transphobia when they feel safe to do so. That they're atheists, in fact, I think is just an afterthought. But when they are, they're not 'live and let live' atheists, but New Atheists, who support the torture and killing of Muslims, and call them all terrorists.   How do you perceive the religious community in relation to feminist issues?   Just as bad, however it seems to me that they rage against Feminism because of their creed, which is strictly conservative and traditionalist in nature. they oppose the progress made for women because it's an affront to their religion. All the while Atheists have no such excuse, and so justify their misogyny by using pseudo-science, like women's brains are smaller, and that's why there are so few women in STEM fields, etc. They're also much more likely to adopt MRA positions that deny Patriarchy, and indeed claim the ascendance and dominance of women and the oppression of men."

It would be the same as saying that everyone who doesn't believe in Unicorns is a community.   Well, yes and no. Certainly taken as a whole, atheists can be considered an heterogeneous group of people who for whatever reason reject a deity, but I think that there is still a strong undercurrent within atheistic spaces like /r/atheism of people who espouse enlightenment-style ideals, which most people now label as New Atheists. These are the people who trust science and rationality over all over forms of epistemology, pursue humanism and the ideal of human progress, and generally are assholes to everyone that does not share their level of skepticism and ""logic"". It is these ideals that tie all four of the ""horsemen"" together and what forms the ideological backbone of the New Atheist Movement. Of course, go onto /r/atheism and they will deny fervently that New Atheists exist, either trying to state that there is nothing ""new"" about it (which is ignoring how movements are named) or that Atheists are not a organized group and shouldn't be called a movement of anything (again, ignoring how movements are determined). Really, their plight is similar to the early Existentialists who where quick to deny that their philosophies should be considered a movement, despite their similarities. But history proved them wrong and if the New Atheists don't become a footnote to history, then they will be proven wrong as well. Of course, all this under the assumption that the ""atheist movement"" is just the New Atheists, as there are plenty of folks that are atheists and aren't New Atheists.  Of course, I am an ignostic, so the problem of defining who is or isn't an atheist or what constitutes an atheist movement isn't one that really affects me that much."

Yes and that's irritating in and of itself, but what's absolutely infuriating is the fact that they suspend said 'logic' and 'reasoning' whenever it suits them. If they were really all that logical, reasonable, rational and skeptical, then they would be the most forward thinking, revolutionary, avant-garde forerunners of social, economic, and political theory. Yet they're just a bunch of intolerant, often reactionary ass wipes who deny the existence of humanity's greatest miseries, injustices and woes if they're unrelated to religion."

But the problem isn't 'Feminism is great, it should be part of Socialism', or vice versa, but rather that it's an unavoidable component. If you oppose all forms of oppression and exploitation, and you want to dismantle any authority, hierarchy or entity which illegitimately claims power over a group of people, in order to enhance and expand the scope of equality and freedom, then fighting the Patriarchy and supporting women's liberation, emancipation and equality is not only desirable, but necessary.  Unfortunately (at least on r/Socialism and r/Anarchism, at a rate of 40% and 30% respectively) there's a minority of people who are class essentialist or economic reductionists. They A) Aren't aware of the Patriarchy, B) Are aware of it but believe it's a legitimate authority, and good luck to those buggers trying to square that with their ideology, C) Are aware of it but choose to suspend their Marxist/Anarchist critical analysis of it because they're mysoginists and prefer to either passively or actively perpetuate the oppression of women, or finally D) Are aware of it but believe that it's a problem that'll be fixed after the Revolution, where sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc will magically end at the snap of a finger.

Since that infographic has exactly the stuff we discussed. Granted the /r/Socialism has 400 votes, while the other has only 100.

They are outright dangerous to people’s well being. Ignoring that is what allows, for instance, a cadre of angry young gamers to pretend “Gamers are Over” is a parallel prejudice to the ongoing harassment of women, queer people, and allies in the gaming world.""   This is really the meat of the message right here. Offensive just doesn't grasp what we are really trying to get at. the sexist racist jokes and causal prejudice attitudes are what justify and actively work to oppress and marginalize the already marginalized people.  its a cycle. and it being offensive is beside the point honestly."

FemmeThoughts,2vse81,Adahn5,26,Fri Feb 13 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"Transcript: The video opens up on a close up of two men dressed in cold-weather clothing, Daniel Norlin and Vlad Reiser. The man to the right, dressed in black (Vlad), begins the narration:  “Hello comrades, and welcome to Normel TV,” he says.  The video fades into a scene of a woman walking down a snow-covered street. It's an urban landscape, a city somewhere in Sweden.  “Sadly we live in a country which has the highest rate of reported cases of rape: a modest land called Sweden.”  The woman is accosted by a man who comes up behind her, placed his hand over her mouth and begins grappling with her.  “Rape is a very serious crime which not only affects our country, but the rest of the world.”  The assault continues, with the man slamming the woman's head against a nearby car, opening the door, and then shoving her in the back seat. He gets in the car along with her.  “And it can happen to anyone. Not only does it traumatise the person being assaulted, but it affects us all as a society. It happens on the count of minutes but leaves a scar for life.”  The scene fades back to the two initial men, and now the one on the left dressed in blue (Daniel), carries on the exposition of the social experiment.  “So in our new social experiment,” he says. “We put Swedish citizens up for a test. Will people interfere after hearing a girl screaming for help from a suspicious-looking car, or will they choose to walk away and leave her helpless to her doom?”  The video fades again to a montage of them setting up the vehicle by obscuring the window, preparing the audio file and fixing the speaker in place.  “Let's find out,” the two men say in unison.  The screen fades to black and the sponsors are revealed in the following captions: in association with Damn.com and Prankster.com. The video begins playing again, this time with a fixed camera view of a street with the aforementioned 'suspicious car' and the audio of the distressed woman begins playing. A male pedestrian walks by and stops for a moment, turning around to face the direction of the screams and notices the movements within the car. He stands, watches, but does nothing.  Another pedestrian is seen approaching, and this one completely ignores the screams. The first pedestrian turns away from the screams and continues on his way. The video jumps forward to two men walking by the vehicle, they also ignore the screams. Again the video jumps to the same car, this time parked near a wooded area. Another man walks by, he too does nothing and continues on his way. A woman crosses him, she ignores the screams as well. Once more the video skips to a female pedestrian who also ignores the screams coming from the car. Two more men walk by, then ignore it as well.  Skip forward to another scene, again the car is parked in a street as in the first instance, and this time trio of people walk right by the car, choosing to ignore the screams and banging coming from inside the vehicle. The video fast-forwards at an accelerated pace, showing countless people walking by, all of them ignoring the woman's pleas for help.  Finally the video skips to a moment where a bystander approaches the vehicle, but he simply walks on by.  The screen fades to black and white captions state the following: About 85% walked away from the scene and didn't even call the police.  Then the following statement is made: 15% chose to react differently.  Requiem for a Dream begins playing in the background and the video reveals a couple of passersby who stop upon hearing the screams. The man knocks on the car window forcefully until the actor playing the assailant emerges from the opposite door.  “Hello,” the female bystander says. “Someone is in there right?”  “No, no,” the assailant says. “No one is in there.”  “But I heard someone scream.”  “No it was nothing really,” the assailant says.  The video leas forward to a woman, another pedestrian who begins running toward other people in the street calling: “Help, help, someone is in the car!”  Another skip leads to a second couple walking by, these stop upon hearing the screams and the man immediately approaches the vehicle and tries to peer in through the window. The woman also approaches and they both start banging on the car window.  The video jumps back to the first couple who were speaking with the actor playing the assailant and the following conversation continues:  “You didn't hear anything,” the assailant says.  “Why do you say that?” The man asks.  “Yes we did!” The woman says.  “Do you think we don't hear?” the man asks. “Let's call the police then, no problems.”  The video skips to another scene of the car parked near the forest, this time a woman approaches the vehicle and takes out her phone, we infer from this that she is calling the police. The video confirms this with an asterisk in the captions stating: *She made a call to the police.  Again the video skips, this time to the second couple who was previously banging on the car window. They are now standing back as the actor playing the assailant opens the door and emerges from the car.  “Where is the girl?” The woman asks.  The man gets in the driver's seat and turns the engine on. The couple continue to look into the car, and even approach the trunk as he attempts to drive away.  Another skip to a pedestrian who approaches the vehicle and opens the car door upon hearing the screams.  “What are you doing?” they say. “Are you being funny now?” Presumably after seeing there is no woman in the back seat.  The video jumps to another female passerby, this one also approaches the car and immediately goes for the door. She opens it, but the assailant within tries to pull it shut.  “What the hell are you doing?” She yells. “Open the door!”  She moves back and takes out her phone, going off-screen.  “What's happening in there? Are you hitting someone?” we hear her say.  The assailant opens the door to tell her: “Nothing is happening.”  “Is somebody hitting somebody?” she asks.  “No no no no,” the assailant says.  “Let the other person get out of the car!”  “Nobody is in the car,” the assailant says. We see him get into the driver's seat then, while several pedestrians approach the vehicle and rub the car windows to peer inside and make sure.  The video skips to yet another scene, this time a woman with her dog rapidly near the car and bang on the window upon hearing the screams.  “Is everything alright?” She asks upon seeing the actor playing the assailant open the door.  “Excuse me?” the assailant asks.  “Is everything alright?”  “Everything is alright,” the assailant says.  “Why are they screaming? Who's in there?” The woman with the dog asks.  “Nobody is screaming, it's alright!” The assailant says.  “We heard someone screaming—we heard screaming,” she says.  “No-”  “And the car was like bumping,” she says and mimes the movement with her arm.  “No, no, it's nothing,” the assailant says.  “I saw it!”  “No, no, no-” The assailant continues.  “Open the door!” She says. “I want to look in!”  “Sorry, I can't,” the assailant says. “Just go, just go please.”  “No, I'll call the police!” She says and points to him. “Open the door.”  “You don't have to call the police. Please”  “Open the door,” she repeats. “Open the door!”  “I can't, sorry, I can't!” The assailant says.  “Then I'll call the police.”  “I have to go.”  The video skips forward to two more pedestrians, two men, who upon hearing the pleas for help reach toward the car and begin banging on the windows. One of the men opens the door and when the actor playing the assailant emerges, the male pedestrian pulls him out and pushes him against the car.  “What are you doing?” he asks the assailant.  They begin grappling as the second man joins in, and they bear the assailant to the ground. The crew of the experiment scramble as things might get violent, and the actor begins calling out:  “It's a social experiment! Take it easy! It's just an experiment!”  All the while the actor is being held down, the second pedestrian goes for the car and opens the doors to check on the victim.  “Boys, damn your reaction was really good!” We hear one of the crew, possibly the actor, say.  “Wow...” one of them says.  They begin speaking in Swedish, saying: “Thank you so much.”  Still in Swedish. “Are you all right? I saw you and I was-” one of the pedestrians say.  “It's okay man,” the actor reassures him.  The two hug it out.  “It's okay man! Thank you for your reaction,” the actor says.  Muddled conversations in Swedish continue, one man says to another that he's strong as a horse. And the captions further elucidate on the conversation about how the man's reaction was because the victim could indeed be anyone:  “It could be your mother, your sister, or somebody you know. It can be your pal, it doesn't even have to be someone you know. You need to react straight away. To make society a safer place.”   The screen fades to black with the caption: The biggest sin of the humankind is indifference... so act as you want others to act when you find yourself in trouble.   End of the video."

FemmeThoughts,2vret0,ruchenn,1 point,Fri Feb 13 12:56:06 2015 UTC,"Just to add to my own post here.  Premier Palaszcuk’s Ministry was sworn in on Sunday afternoon, 2015-02-15.  And, in good news for anyone who’s of a mind to think its good when the people in power are drawn from as wide a demographic as is possible, her Cabinet is basically evenly split along gender lines.  The Premier and Deputy Premier are women. The Treasurer is a bloke. And the entire 15-member cabinet consists of eight women and seven men.  There’s one indigenous Minister (Leeanne Enoch) and, in what I take as a good sign, she is not the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. Rather she’s the Minister for Housing and Public Works and the Minister for Science and Innovation.  Enoch aside, the Ministry is still a small crowd of nothing but Anglo-Saxon, Irish or other European heritage faces. But its still good to see an Anglophone government that doesn’t look like a Boys-only Boarding School reunion photo."

FemmeThoughts,2vmt2s,freeasabrd,96,Thu Feb 12 07:59:11 2015 UTC,"They have understood “equal treatment” to mean “treating all people in exactly the same way, regardless of their social realities,” and as is so often the case with workplace discrimination, “treating people in exactly the same way” seems to be “treating everyone like a heterosexual married man who has a wife at home to take care of all of life’s invisible work”.   This is such an important statement. This is what frustrates me so much when you see people complaining about social/welfare programmes (or, in higher education, scholarships) which help groups which face systemic discrimination along various lines; the fact is that, if you're a straight, white male (regardless of your personal circumstances) you don't face systemic discrimination, because in the western world, the straight, white, male is seen as the norm. This is why the cry for egalitarianism has ultimately become a dog-whistle term; if you care about equality for all, then you are obliged to support programmes that help women and minorities precisely because they are not treated equally on a systemic basis. But, when you see people claiming to be egalitarian, what they are so often saying is, ""let's treat everyone like a straight white male and refuse to acknowledge the socio-cultural differences that different groups experience, because providing them with extra support feels unfair because straight white men can't access that support"". It is pure privilege in action as it refuses to acknowledge that maybe there is a good reason to provide extra help to groups who do not experience the socio-cultural advantages that being part of the majority, normative group accords you."

But here it is:    People think that affirmative action is like having a race between a white man and a black man (or whichever disadvantaged group).  The race is run, the white man wins, but they give the medal to the black man, anyway.    In reality, affirmative action is more like having a race between a white man and a black man, but the black man has to carry a 50 pound weight.  The race is run and they tie.  Society tends to give the award to the white man, anyway, but if you think about it, the black man overcame more, so affirmative action recognizes him as the winner."

Special treatment for not getting fired because of who you're in a relationship with? Isn't that just equal treatment? It's ludicrous."
FemmeThoughts,2vmt2s,asdfjlk55,5,Thu Feb 12 16:19:22 2015 UTC,"It could be construed as ""special treatment"" if it's laid out that way, that LGBT individuals have access to remedies or processes that cis-straight folks don't.  But usually, it's worded as having protection regardless of orientation/gender expression, in which case, it protects everyone. It just so happens that people who aren't LGBT generally don't need protection from discrimination based on their orientation or presentation.  Though I think protection for trans people should instead be bundled with gender discrimination protection; i.e. protect people from discrimination based on gender expression... which would protect men who have long hair and women who wear slacks and people who were assigned a different gender at birth and people who don't identify strictly as one gender or another... and also would prohibit differential treatment based on gender (expression)."

After we saw the Lego Movie, I told him I liked it, but I wished there were more/better female characters, especially since it's a movie directed at kids. He got frustrated with me for nitpicking little tiny things (like representation in media) instead of focusing on ""real"" things (like obvious workplace discrimination/domestic abuse/etc.).   He's normally very supportive of women's issues, but no matter what I say, I can't seem to get him to understand that the little things that he doesn't even think about are actually a huge issue. He works in a very male-dominated environment, and I know he'd get very upset if he saw, for example, a male coworker talking down to a female coworker and using demeaning, sexist language. But I don't think he'd even notice if, for example, the male coworker frequently interrupted the female coworker, or never seriously considered her ideas.   I think that's very common for people who don't experience it every day or don't have a reasonably strong interest in learning about it. They want to be supportive, and they think they're doing everything they can to create an environment that's comfortable for women, but there are so many little things that they don't even consider, because just seeing it happen to someone a couple times a day doesn't provide enough context to understand why it's a problem, or how frustrating it can be for the people it's happening to."

FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,kahrismatic,152,Wed Feb 11 11:07:22 2015 UTC,"Men are expected to work dangerous and difficult jobs in construction and agriculture.   I love when MRAs bring that up, because I always ask what job they do. Because it's never one of the difficult or dangerous jobs in construction or agriculture.  Those of us that do construction work do it because we like it and it pays a hell of a lot of money.  It also ignores that one of the main reasons women are heavily underrepresented in those fields, especially construction, is because they're traditionally viewed as being unfriendly toward women. They're getting better about it now, which the MRAs oppose, by the way, and the percentage of women is going up."
FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,Seldarin,119,Tue Feb 10 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"Also, it massively ignores the point that there are female-dominated jobs out there that are pretty horrible (and dangerous) too, just in different ways. Sweatshops are overwhelmingly worked by women (and children), and let's not forget that many jobs which involve dealing with human filth are female-dominated - cleaners are overwhelmingly female, as are carers of the elderly and infirm (which frequently involves dealing with bodily waste), and even in the medical sector, it's the nurses etc. who do a lot of the really unpleasant stuff (a patient gets explosive diarrhoea, it ain't gonna be the doctor who cleans it up!).  Yes, there are jobs out there that are male-dominated, and are dangerous, and unpleasant, and dirty. But unpleasant jobs exist for women, too. The fact that some men end up in unpleasant, male-dominated jobs is not an argument against the systemic oppression of women, particularly when many of those male-dominated jobs are male-dominated because of the way we privilege the masculine. Men are soldiers because masculinity is being strong, and aggressive. Men work dangerous, high risk jobs because masculinity is being brave, and taking risks. It may be a terrible privilege at times, but it is still privilege nonetheless."
FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,Fairleee,54,Tue Feb 10 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"More pertinently, which professions are the most underpaid?  Social work. Nursing. Cleaning. Seamstressing. The female dominated industries, not the male ones."
FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,phatphace,24,Wed Feb 11 06:27:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and this is something which has been widely studied in my field (Organisational Studies) for quite some time; Joan Acker is the seminal author in this case. Jobs that are gendered as feminine become seen as lesser, worthy of less pay, and less respect. MRAs often claim that the discrimination men face who want to get into jobs like child-care as an example of systemic male oppression, but this ignores a massive fact - there aren't droves and droves of men all desperate to get into childcare, because childcare is seen as a feminine job. Femininity is usually seen as lesser than masculinity, and a lot of psychological studies which look at work show that men don't want to work feminine roles, because they would see it as demeaning to their masculine identity. So yeah, ""women's"" jobs are seen as worthy of less respect, and are often paid less - for example, cleaning staff (which is usually a female-dominated, feminine occupation) have often been paid less than janitorial staff (which is usually a male-dominated, masculine occupation), despite the fact there is a huge amount of overlap between the work that cleaners and janitors do. Janitors may do some small handyman-style jobs as well, but it is usually low level stuff, as any repairs needing skilled labour would require the services of a skilled individual (e.g. a plumber, a joiner, an electrician etc.). Generally janitorial work is not more skilled than cleaning work, and any extra handymanning they might do is not because their work is more skilled, but because the job is seen as masculine, and therefore those small level repair jobs are seen as appropriate for men to do, but not women - not because of a difference in skill levels, but a difference in the way the jobs are gendered. There's actually a class action suit in the UK at the moment against a city council where this is the argument the women involved are making; they were paid less despite doing the same level of work as their equivalent male colleagues."

FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,Fairleee,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:09:13 2015 UTC,"Doesn't your second paragraph contradict your first one? In your first you argue that women work in dangerous places like sweatshops too and in your second, you say that the right to work dangerous jobs is given to men and not women. Or are you saying that, despite the fact that dangerous female jobs exist, there should be more of them?"
FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,appropriate-username,22,Wed Feb 11 03:38:19 2015 UTC,"Apologies if I wasn't very clear! The point of my first paragraph was to show that the evidence MRAs use to show what they believe to be systemic oppression of men relies on cherry-picking. A common MRA argument is that it is men who are corralled into dirty, dangerous jobs because we see men as disposable. This ignores the fact that  there are dirty and dangerous jobs that women do, too. The point of the second paragraph was to address the way these jobs are gendered, and show how male privilege is the reason why men end up in the dirty, dangerous male-dominated jobs. Men are soldiers not because we view men as disposable, but because we believe that masculinity is strong, and aggressive, and a protective force. Men work in dangerous jobs like offshore drilling because we believe that masculinity is better suited to working with heavy machinery, that there is a nobility in getting covered with soot, and smoke, and oil, and grease from working with machines (it is interesting to note, here, that we do not see the same nobility in female-dominated jobs where they have to deal with human waste. The image of a man covered in soot and grease is a powerful, heroic one. The sight of a women with faeces smeared on her apron is not.), and that to be masculine is to be brave and take risks. We don't corral men into these jobs because we see men as disposable, but because we gender those jobs as masculine due to the way we privilege masculinity, and therefore it is men who end up working them, whilst women are discouraged (both consciously and subconsciously) from joining them.  That is what I meant when I said ""terrible privilege""; privilege is a double-edged sword.  For example, traditional masculinity is constructed as strong, and brave, and as a protecting force of others weaker than itself, and this is a privilege - but, this is the same privilege that would expect a man to give up a seat in a lifeboat in favour of a woman. Again, MRAs use this as an argument to support their theory of male disposability, but that ignores how the chivalric motivation behind giving up your seat on a lifeboat is based on the privilege that men have to be strong, and brave, and active, and protectors of others."
FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,Fairleee,18,Wed Feb 11 08:40:20 2015 UTC,"On mobile so excuse formatting but I'll point to this research: www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/07/31/3554854.htm which has found women and children first as a concept breaks down in practice in favour of every man for himself in actual disasters. Which as it turns out men are more likely to survive (30% survival chance for women, 40% for male passengers, higher for male crew). The Titanic, which is what mra's cite, is the exception, not the rule.  I'm not meaning to be hugely picky, I really enjoyed your comments btw, but literally everything mra's say is based on lies that break down under scrutiny, and it frustrates me when I see any of them being accepted."
FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,kahrismatic,11,Wed Feb 11 11:01:00 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting study, thank you! I was more talking about the cultural expectation that men should sacrifice themselves in a disaster as opposed to what happens in practice; but to be honest, I'm kind of unsurprised to find it doesn't happen in real life. Socialised expectations are a very powerful force, but I suspect the instinct of self-preservation is stronger!"

I now understand the point of the first paragraph but am still a bit confused about the second:   The second paragraph points out that in the male-dominated dangerous work fields, they aren't male dominated because the work is dangerous, but because of male privilege.   What exactly is the male privilege, as applied to this situation? I've been thinking it's the privilege to work in dangerous jobs (though I don't understand why this can be called a privilege, since those typically tend to be good things, but whatever) but if those jobs aren't dangerous then that idea doesn't make sense."
FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,appropriate-username,3,Thu Feb 12 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"They aren't male-dominated because we only men do dangerous work, but because of the way society values masculinity. Women have traditionally been outright barred from certain male-dominated work, or if not barred, heavily discriminated against and harassed.  It's not that it's a privilege to have a dangerous job. Lots of men and women are stuck doing very dangerous work and that sucks. But the difference between female-dominated dangerous work and male-dominated dangerous work is that the male-dominated work is better paid and better respected. And more attention is paid to it. To quote /u/Fairlee above:   Men are soldiers because masculinity is being strong, and aggressive. Men work dangerous, high risk jobs because masculinity is being brave, and taking risks. It may be a terrible privilege at times, but it is still privilege nonetheless.   Compare that to women who work in sweatshops. Working in a sweatshop is not considered brave. It is not respected and it is terribly poorly paid. Little attention is paid to it, or how dangerous the work is.   That is, both men and women do terribly dangerous work. But such male-dominated fields are male-dominated due to male privilege (societal respect for masculinity), not female privilege (the bizarre idea that only men work dangerous jobs)."
FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,hermithome,56,Thu Feb 12 22:23:53 2015 UTC,"I really do like that the author brings up how likable these men are at first brush. Reminds me of the time I had a conversation with a biannual co-worker who is a very bright, witty, charming, competent, feminist ally. I'd known him casually and professionally for a few years.  I made some joke about Steven Spielberg films (it had nothing to with terms of his religion or background), and he says casually:  ""Well, Spielberg will always be a good storyteller. He comes from a people of compelling fiction. Just look at the Holocaust"". (Emphasis mine)  ""...Wait, did you just use the terms ""compelling fiction"" to refer to the fucking Holocaust?""  He had the social grace to look uncomfortable, ""Well, we all know it was pretty exaggerated...""  ""...I'm just backing away now. I don't think this is a conversation you want to have with me.""  ""Sorry. Geez.""  And that guy, it turns out, isn't without value. He's still somebody I want available in a logistical bind. He's still reliable and compassionate. He's eloquent and blogs widely about human and animal rights issues.  He's also a Holocaust denier.  It's just the weirdest thing, but I'm glad the author mentioned it. Just like MRAs get this mental image of feminists being this monolith of non-shaving, zero hygiene, man-hating trolls, feminists get this mental image of MRAs as the basement dwelling ""neckbeard"" prototype. When the conversation is happening from behind a keyboard, it's easy to forget that you don't know the person and attack them instead of their ideas.  /2 cents"

And when it comes down to it, his relationship with reality and the Holocaust have nothing to do with our working relationship. I think the only reason he said it was because we so thoroughly align in almost every other area, he just assumed his stance (while again, repugnant) was a reasonable one. No, it categorically is not, but I'm a little less friendly and a little more... professional with him on the odd event we work together.

FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,oogmar,2,Wed Feb 11 05:10:53 2015 UTC,"This entire thread has been removed for derailing. There are important and worthwhile issues to discuss regard femininity, shaving, male-gaze, feminism, lesbianism and so on, but they are completely and totally off-topic.  Recognising that trolls and creeps and misogynists don't have visible signage declaring themselves, despite what certain stereotypes would have you believe is not anti-feminist. Not does it have anything to do with various harmful tropes about lesbians.   Additionally, there are a lot of comments in this thread that misrepresented basic feminist principles. That's not okay people. Yes you can be a woman and a feminist and shave your legs. That's totally okay. But that does not make shaving your legs a feminist act. Not everything that feminist women do is feminist."

From an analogical standpoint, which is ""worse"": making fun of a bully or making fun of a bully's victim? In much the same way, I would argue that there is a false equivalency in asserting that men (or people in general) who hate women fitting ""the feminist stereotype"" is on the same level as women (or people in general) who hate men fitting ""the MRA stereotype."""
FemmeThoughts,2vfqji,mundabit,4,Wed Feb 11 04:57:16 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of a guy I know and am involved with.  We met via an online dating site (as you do) and he stood out as being respectful and treating me for the person I am.   We went on a long date where we talked about what we were looking for, neither of us wanted anything serious, we were both pretty much looking for a regular booty call type thing.  We discussed common interests including DnD, Magic! and the latest in the local Film industry.  Then we hooked up and had sex. We had some talk before hand, regards to protection, infection, beliefs on abortion, and kinks. Everything matched up and we seemed to share the same values.  Afterwards, lying back, He asks me about my past relationships, specifically my lesbian relationships, he then starts making (accurate) inferences about my kinks, saying ""It's so interesting that you are a dom with women, but a sub with men, It supports the theory that all women just want a man to own them""  I probe him some more and though talking he openly admits to being a TRPer and MRA, He expresses some pretty sexism views in line with TRP thinking, But as an MRA he was pretty egalitarian, Talking about how ""the disposable male"" keeps women out of certain lines of work, I pointed out that the ""Male provider"" prevents men from taking on carer roles but also prevents women from taking on provider roles or from growing up without a sense of individuality that compels them to rely on men.  He nodded along and said he was glad I agreed with him, He then said ""You don't often meet a female MRA"" I rolled over and looked him in the eye ""No, I'm a feminist, The way a true feminist is, We want equality for all, The issues we complain about are not just female issues, they are gender issues, Just like MRA isn't fighting just for men, they are fighting to stop double standards in gender""  We talked more, about how feminism means that a woman can want to be owned by a man, But it's not because she is a woman, it's because she is an individual with her own wants. He seemed to understand. But he still identifies as a TRPer and an MRA, and I still fuck him, because he's not a bad guy because of his beliefs."

Telling feminists to cater to men is like telling socialists to cater to bosses. It's nonsensical at best, and outright offensive at worst.

In my daily life, I wear what is comfy and try to be current/relatively fashionable, appropriate for the occasion etc.  I have never really thought much about men's opinions of my outfit,s only how I feel in them - if the outfit makes me feel confident and well put together then it's a good outfit.

This definitely happens of course, but the thing is--not all oppression is the same, and it can't be treated as the same problem across all genders, races, classes, orientations, etc. So in order to really fix any of these problems, everyone needs to be on the same page and recognize that yes, women face problems simply because they are women, and those need to be dealt with, not derailed by men saying they have problems too and actually it's not that bad for women, it's worse for men.  This is what MRAs do, without fail. This is what makes them part of the problem, although I agree many of them have genuine pain and struggles for which they deserve empathy and help.

Wadhwa says shaky self-confidence is one of the chief things holding women back. It’s not just about the money, though. Wadhwa says women not only are reluctant to overstate their accomplishments and goals; they habitually understate them. “Often I have to say to them, Why are you underselling?” he says. “When I coach women, I tell them how wonderful they are. Women won’t make the ridiculous projections about their companies that the guys will. They won’t say the really stupid thing the nerds do. They are a lot more realistic and practical and humble.”   I realise the practical aspect of this and the value in teaching women how the system works and to adapt to it, but I guess deep down I just don't get why women have to say the stupid things nerds to and make wild projections. We can agree that downright understating your accomplishments isn't ideal but why isn't there a push for employers or investors to meet women half way? In other words: Why do women have to speak like men to be taken seriously, what is with that."

Also, how the hell do they plan to enforce this law?? ""Excuse mam, or should I say... SIR! SHOW ME YOUR GENITALS IMMEDIATELY!""

My mom just didnt make enough to provide a lot, so we made do with what we had.  I think the problem with very angry men that drink is that you don't put yourself in a situation where you can ever think clearly. Most alcholics/addicts hardly ever take responsibility for their roles in shitty situations. If they were capable of that, they would likely control their addiction.   They begin to live in a bubble of anger and now with the internet, youre able to connect with equally angry and blameful people who reinforce your shitty ideas. This notion that it's never your fault is a cop out.   The worst part is that you leave behind children that are very sad because of your choices. The choice not to visit.

FemmeThoughts,2uuepj,hermithome,8,Thu Feb 5 05:46:36 2015 UTC,"The author's point about the immediacy of this affecting a primary character is really important. The show is in its fourth season, and so we really know Bay well. This is a flesh and blood person that we know about and care for, as opposed to the usual manner in which the character is defined by being a victim.  For me personally, watching the episode was both fascinating and heartbreaking. The second that Bay interrupted her mother in the kitchen and then couldn't say what she wanted to, I knew that this wasn't guilt over a hookup, but something much worse.   Had this been just about any other show, I probably would have started freaking out, assuming that they were going to handle it abysmally. But I've been watching the show for years, and I've learned to trust that they can handle telling these sorts of stories properly. The show regularly handles racism, sexism, classism, ableism and so on, and it does so well. It's not preachy, its nuanced. And the characters get their own voices and genuine perspectives. You never feel like its a man writing for a woman, or a white person writing for a black person or a hearing person writing for a deaf person. The perspectives given are authentic, and its really lovely, because these are voices we don't really get to hear a lot in mainstream media. And they're stories that don't really get told.  I'll admit, I totally gave a sigh of relief when Regina finally said the word ""rape"", because I was waiting for someone to properly name what had happened, but mostly I was just immersed in the show, caring about the characters.   As soon as the show finished airing, I hopped online to see what people were saying. And I was pretty disappointed. A lot of the articles I saw referred to what happened as a ""hookup"" or ""sleeping together"" or various other euphemisms for sex. Even when the rest of the article was good, there was still this constant naming of rape as sex. Which is itself a huge issue in tackling campus rape, and so to see that same mistake echoed everywhere was disappointing. Which in and of itself speaks volumes about the climate that this show is telling this story in."

Is there any prohibition against showing women worshipping, or is it just not done because women are generally stuck in a space that is not the main part (which seems to be reserved for men)?"
FemmeThoughts,2usa1i,PinkOrchidFan,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"Well, this isn't exactly unique to worshippers at mosques. It's true of worship in general. There are a bunch of reasons for this. Part of it is that some houses of worship segregate men and women (and the women almost always have worse conditions). Part of this is because images often tend to show the front, and people in prominence. Many religious sects don't allow women to serve in leadership roles, and even among the ones that do, there are fewer women leaders. When it comes to things like daily worship, even among places that do allow women, women are often practically excluded anyway, for reasons of child care and housework.  This isn't something unique to Islam. Go back and look and try looking for pictures of women praying in general - pictures that date before the last decade and easy access to photography and a way to share it. You're going to be hard pressed to find many, especially many of women in a group.     Edit: just to prove my point, I tried doing a handful of google image searches. For example, here's a fairly depressing one searching for the terms ""tallis"" and ""jew"" (you need the ""jew"" part or you get totally irrelevant results based on character names). Yeah, there are images of women in the top results. But only a few, and they're all really recent images. All of the older images, especially paintings and drawings: exclusively male. In fact, there are more results for women wearing shirts that say: ""nice tallis, want to fuck?"" then there are of women wearing a tallis. There are a lot of things that factor into this result. Orthodox sects tend to segregate men and women and forbid (or at least discourage) women from wearing tallit (whereas for men, it's mandatory). In less coservative sects, women still don't wear tallit in the same numbers that men do, and there's less tallis wearing in general because they tend to be less religious. There's also the fact that Jews are generally not the ones taking these photos, because taking photos on the Sabbath is prohibited. So in order for Orthodox Jewish women to accomplish something similar to the #sideentrance movement that Islamic women started, they'd need to come on another day for the explicit purposes of photography (when there likely wouldn't be people praying). Also, a number of these photos are taken at the Wailing Wall, where women are prohibited.  So, as this non-Islamic example shows, a lot of things go into what images we see. The bottom line is that women are less visible, by design. And for most of the history of these religions, what images we saw were controlled by people with money and power. It's not like any random person can create stained glass windows, or great paintings or sketches: these were financed by men in power. And what images were preserved were again, financed and controlled by men in power. The same is true for most of the history of photography. The ability of the average person to take a photograph and publish it is a relatively recent phenomenon. People who previously didn't have a voice, and weren't seen, now have at least a little power to make themselves seen and heard. That's huge. And its one reason that accessibility issues in technology are hugely important. See also: /r/cyberfeminism"

It's employment law...basically, whether the woman was effectively fired or whether she quit. The circuit court decided (and SCOTUS didn't change) that, basically, even though her employer kinda dropped the ball, they weren't actually trying to harass her into quitting, which is more or less the 8th circuit's standard for ""constructive discharge"". She asked them to consider a more lenient standard from the 7th circuit, but they refused to. She might have had better luck arguing that she was actually fired, not just constructively, but she didn't argue that in trial court so the 8th circuit ruled that she couldn't argue it in appeal.   Basically: yes, the situation is screwed up. Yes, American employees need better protection against their employers. No, this has nothing to do with men lactating."
FemmeThoughts,2usult,ZBLongladder,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"No, this has nothing to do with men lactating.    Not true. Read the full decision, or at least the full article.   The trial court also held, nonsensically, that even if Angela had been fired because she was breastfeeding that was not sex discrimination, in part because men can lactate under certain circumstances.   The case was not dismissed on the grounds that being fired for breastfeeding is not sex discrimination, that's correct. It was dismissed for her not taking enough steps to complain before resigning, which is kinda bullshit in this case, given that a) the issue was time-sensitive and b) her resignation was forced.  But they did also say that even if she had been fired because she was breastfeeding that it still wouldn't have been sex discrimination because men can lactate too."

I guess it's more that I expect everyone to be fussing over it for days. If it was just the few minutes it would be fine but it's a huge pop culture event and nobody can shut up about it. So it's not just the few minutes, it's the days of discussion and replays and hashtag-wcw that I'm worried about.

I feel like my boyfriend isn't even in the thought process. If it was about him and how he feels about me, that would probably mean that his independent decision to change and subsequent years of clean, respectful behavior should make me feel better. I feel better about the relationship, but I can't unthink the anxious logic I use to make myself miserable. It's still there, I'm still going to constantly worry about how I compare to X person.   I also just think my relationship itself is way better for me. He and his mother are instrumental in helping me get back in therapy. I literally could not do it without them. He's also a blast to hang out with all the time and we're very close. Everyone who knows me well knows that he's been good for me.

FemmeThoughts,2ucor9,mycatatemyhomeworkk,9,Sat Jan 31 23:14:50 2015 UTC,"But sometimes people challenge that and ask 'why not egalitarianism'   I think there are a couple parts to this kind of question. If someone asks this question in good faith, then I think they should be prepared for a lengthy discussion about what types of egalitarianism they were considering and what types of feminism you ascribe to. Egalitarianism and feminism are not mutually exclusive. There are egalitarian philosophies that can look very feminist in nature. There is no reason why you can't be both a feminist and an egalitarian of some sort. There are many different philosophies in both, with different focuses, and different goals.   I think that someone asking broadly, ""why not egalitarianism?"" may not be familiar with the diversity of egalitarian or feminist philosophy. Perhaps you could challenge them back by asking them about what they believe egalitarianism and feminism to be? Make them explain what they think of either and why they think one could be an alternative to the other. This places more burden on them, and it will unveil any biases or misunderstandings or false preconceptions that they may have.  I would argue that a major difference between feminism and egalitarianism is that egalitarianism is not attached to any movement. However, feminism has been tied closely with its movement throughout history. Some feminists may even argue that feminist philosophy is inseparable from the movement. I personally don't ascribe to that view, but you can imagine how activism is close to feminism's heart.  I can imagine egalitarianism as an alternative for those who don't want to be affiliated with feminism, or don't want to be affiliated with the feminist movement. Some forms of egalitarianism let you commit to equality between genders without making an activist commitment and without adopting some common feminist conceptions about gender or culture or patriarchy. However, this does not get rid of tough philosophical questions about what groups should be equal and how these groups should be defined. So you are still trapped with coming up with some kind of gender theory, a theory of injustice, and a moral framework. It is important to remember that every philosophy is contestable. They all have holes, sometimes gaping ones; egalitarianism not excluded.   'women do not suffer from inequality - name one way that women are not equal to men - they've been equal for a long time!'   I think just looking up some statistics on this and then giving them clear examples is about the only way to deal with that, assuming they are willing to believe. I can think of the pay gap, the virtual non-existence of female CEO's, the very small amounts of women in STEM and technology fields, sexism in technology fields that leads many women to leave good paying jobs entirely, the prevalence of sexual harassment toward women, and a culture that endorses rape and protects rapists. You can also supplement this with your own experiences.   i guess I just want a simple, point by point explanation of what feminism is exactly   I am stealing some of this from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy page on feminism:   Men and women are entitled to equal rights and respect. Women are currently disadvantaged with respect to rights and respect, compared with men.   This is a skeleton description. Where feminism starts dividing is on questions about how women are oppressed or disadvantaged and what kinds of conditions bring about that oppression. These in turn impact what feminist's believe to be proper solutions to injustice (activism). So ask yourself what constitutes injustice and in what ways women are disadvantaged, then you can think of reasons why you think these injustices exist. So we could build-up the explanation:   Men and women are entitled to equal rights and respect. Women are currently disadvantaged with respect to rights and respect, compared with men. These are the types of injustices that I believe women suffer: [fill in with your own ideas about what constitutes injustice] These are some of the reasons why I believe these injustices exist: [fill in with what you believe the key sources of the problems are. Sources maybe cultural, political, and religious].   *Note that egalitarianism only involves the first point. An egalitarian perspective may not comment on 2, 3, or 4; namely the condition that women are in, the definitions of injustices, or the sources of those injustices. A well developed egalitarian philosophy should comment on these issues, but depending on how it does so, it maybe indistinguishable from a feminist philosophy, so why not call it one?  Additionally, I would like to add two more points stolen from the link. This focuses on feminism as anti-sexism, which defines feminism as a philosophy that is principally concerned with injustices related to sex:   Women, and those who appear to be women, are subjected to wrongs and/or injustice at least in part because they are or appear to be women. The wrongs/injustices ought not to occur and should be stopped when and where they do. [same as above] [same as above]   I think if you ever have a few minutes to sit down and write out what you think about 3 & 4 and then summarize it, I think you would have a pretty good personalized definition of feminism that you could quickly confer to someone else.  Hopefully this addressed a few of your questions/concerns at least a little bit, even if not completely."
FemmeThoughts,2ucor9,see996able,3,Sun Feb 1 04:05:32 2015 UTC,"To add on a bit about egalitarianism, it's just not the same thing as feminism. Broadly speaking, egalitarianism is the outcome that feminism (specifically intersection feminism) strives for.  More specifically, egalitarianism is a lot of things, some of which overlap with feminism, some of which don't. There are multiple specific definitions for what egalitarianism means in different contexts: political, religious, economic and so on.  But that's not really an answer to the question, because most people who insist on egalitarianism instead of feminism are anti-feminist, they just don't want to sound anti-feminist. It looks bad to be against equality, so they try and flip the script by saying: ""well, feminist isn't about equality, because if it was, it wouldn't contain ""fem"", so I'm an egalitarian"".  I favour the ""act confused and ask for clarification"" tactic. I ask if they're talking about philosophical, political or religious egalitarianism. They usually say philosophical or political, and then I get to ask which one. This is generally the point where they start to blather something nonsensical.  Another way to go is to ask specific questions. Do they see any differences between the way men and women are treated now? Try and pin down what they mean by egalitarian, and whether the issue is that they are anti-feminist, believe feminism isn't necessary, or simply terrified by the word feminism."

You can try an 18-year-old as an adult, send them to war to be killed by IEDs, and many, many other pretty dangerous and questionable things, but someone almost a decade older than that is incapable of making decisions about their own bodies and their own reproductive future? I just don't get it.   I mean, here's the thing. People should be allowed to make decisions about their own bodies, provided it doesn't hurt anyone else. Even if you think their decisions are wrong, or silly, or irrational (and for the record, I don't think sterilization is any of those things, at least not without any other context). People should be allowed to undergo procedures that they fully and knowledgeably consent to, even if you wouldn't make the same choice. That's called FREEDOM, people.   And for the record, I was that 19-year-old who was totally never going to have kids, only to be the 25-year-old who is sort of kind of considering it (although adoption is a very much desired possibility). (Like the author of this article, I'm a carrier for a major genetic disease and that could be one reason for potentially having non-biological children.)   Even so, if I had actually made that choice (and quite frankly, I was much less secure in my decision-making process than this author is, so it's not even comparable really), I would have stuck with it! I would have lived a happy, fulfilled, tenured (hopefully) childfree life and been fine. Quite frankly, even though I'm less adamantly childfree I can absolutely envision a happy, non-regretful, non-resentful life future without kids. It's possible!   But whatever. To the rest of the world, women are cattle fit for breeding, and I guess there's not much to be done. :/"

I am currently on the progesterone-only pill - which is not as effective as I'd like at contraception, but is effective at controlling my pain.  I absolutely do not want children. I don't like them, I don't like the idea of looking after them all the time, and I am terrified of pregnancy.   Thus, the logical solution is sterilisation. I am only 16 right now, and there is always the chance of me changing my mind - that comes with every big decision. I really hope someone will listen to me when I feel like I need one."

You are sure that there are better ways to achieve the same results, you are sure that the IUD isn't as bad as the surgery. You're sure, even though you have absolutely nothing to back that up, and even though the article went into detail explaining that for many women, there is nothing to achieve the same result. You either didn't listen to the author, or you didn't trust her to relay her own experiences, and that's not okay. You do not have to agree with her positions, but you cannot invalidate her lived experiences, and what she relays about her own body. You can't decide what is and is not simple for her, or what is or is not painful.  Maybe she will regret her choices. But that doesn't really matter. She's an adult woman and this is her choice to make, you don't need to keep her from being able to make that choice out of some ill-guided attempt at protection.   The line about regret btw, is pretty much identical to the line used by people who try and ban abortion. And what it means is that you don't trust women to make their own choices, and that you think you know what's better for them. That's denying women the most basic form of agency there is: control over their own body. It's also patronising as can be.

The woman who wrote the article said she's been trying for 4 years, how many years until she's no longer a stranger off the street?   I understand the logic, but it's the product of the antiquated concept that all women should reproduce, and it's not right. My best friend had an IUD that enhanced the pain from what was most likely endometriosis, and went to a million different doctors until one would finally do the surgery to see if it was endo and if so get rid off it. She woke up screaming in the middle of the night once so I took her to the emergency room, only to have the doctor there tell her that even though she's in pain everyday, doctors don't want to do the surgery because it MIGHT affect her fertility. Utterly fucking ridiculous."
FemmeThoughts,2u7rq8,FinnishFiddler,6,Sat Jan 31 02:41:54 2015 UTC,"The point of my entire comment including the story about my friend was that yes, sure there are legal issues but they can be solved with disclaimers and contracts and such. All too often, how the doctor personally feels about the woman having kids is what makes the decision, over the woman's actual choice. The procedure itself is not illegal, and the line for ""old enough"" is completely arbitrary which isn't fair. I'm not saying doctors should be forced to do the procedure, but they are a part of society and society needs to get the hell over this concept that the most important thing a woman can do is pop out a kid."

The stories of women who need it for medical reasons, who have asked for it for years and are still refused. And these doctors are comfortable performing the procedure on women ""old enough"" which is an arbitrary age they've set in their mind, based on how they think others should live their lives. There's no issue with the actual procedure, just the age so why not get the woman to sign a disclaimer or a contract and give her what she wants/needs?"
FemmeThoughts,2u6stv,Marius_Eponine,11,Fri Jan 30 11:32:51 2015 UTC,"Stating that her death has been ruled a homicide after saying that she was shot and killed is a bit redundant.   A homicide only means that one person killed another person. It does not lay any blame, it does not suggest that someone is at fault, it just means she died because someone killed her.  We know a police officer shot her - whether or not it was justified is another question - but to say it has been ruled a homicide kind of sensationalizes it."

Also, the videos are not super white, which is nice. Range of bodies, range of colours, that's good.  My one thing is, why is the campaign called ""ThisGirlCan""?

Everyone is on a different level regarding fitness and being ablebodied. It's not fair to generalize in either direction.  I think it's a response kind of like if someone were to say ""well girls can't be held to the same physical fitness standards as guys,"" and rather than just saying ""yes they can!"" it's taking many different specific women and many different examples and saying ""this girl can"" and ""this girl can"" and ""this girl can"" until the evidence is mounting enough to refute the generalization. It's sort of like, ""oh, you think girls can't? Let me prove you wrong one woman at a time.""  That's how I saw it, but I do feel like your criticism is completely legitimate. I can absolutely see how it could validate ""girls can't""."

It's sort of like, ""oh, you think girls can't? Let me prove you wrong one woman at a time.""   See, but I don't think that's how it works.    Every story you hear about llamas is the same. You see it in books: the poor doomed baby llama getting chomped up by its intemperate parent. On television: the massive tide of scaly llamas falling in a great, majestic herd into the sea below. In the movies: bad-ass llamas smoking cigars and painting their scales in jungle camouflage.  Because you’ve seen this story so many times, because you already know the nature and history of llamas, it sometimes shocks you, of course, to see a llama outside of these media spaces. The llamas you see don’t have scales. So you doubt what you see, and you joke with your friends about “those scaly llamas” and they laugh and say, “Yes, llamas sure are scaly!” and you forget your actual experience.  What you remember is the llama you saw who had mange, which sort of looked scaly, after a while, and that one llama who was sort of aggressive toward a baby llama, like maybe it was going to eat it. So you forget the llamas that don’t fit the narrative you saw in films, books, television – the ones you heard about in the stories – and you remember the ones that exhibited the behavior the stories talk about. Suddenly, all the llamas you remember fit the narrative you see and hear every day from those around you.  You make jokes about it with your friends. You feel like you’ve won something. You’re not crazy. You think just like everyone else.  excerpt from ""'We Have Always Fought': Challenging the 'Women, Cattle, and Slaves' Narrative"" by Kameron Hurley   The narrative of ""girls can't"" is pervasive. And it can never be countered one example at a time because those examples are always considered exceptions: even if they are the norm. This is why even women who are on sports teams, and spend every day working out with other women, can still buy into this narrative. They are an exception, their friends are an exception, their team is an exception.   I do get that the campaign is trying to sell an individual message because that's what sells. ""This Girl Can"" = ""You Can"", as in, you can be this girl. It's a message of individual empowerment. Which is fine. I'm not sure I can easily come up with a message that is individually empowering and addresses these stereotypes without giving the stereotypes some sort of validation.   Just a small quibble."

FemmeThoughts,2u1hr7,miscreantpossum,9,Thu Jan 29 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, Germaine Greer. She may not believe in transphobia, just like I don't believe her ideology does anything to help dismantle the harmful social systems in place that oppress women.   Honestly, she and others like Cathy MacKinnon and Sheila Jeffreys are so utterly dated in their ideology that gender studies undergrads could quite easily dissect and debunk their work. Hers and similar viewpoints rely on a very specific worldview being objective and accurate in order for their ideology to remain stable and logical, but even ignoring the transgender element, they still fail to account for a great many realities in our world that ultimately sink their theories.    And so I honestly can't help but wonder why people bring Germaine Greer and her ilk to events like this unless it's just for a controversial name to draw people in, because her views are certainly no more valid or interesting than the average Jane Doe gender studies student hanging around Cambridge. Hell, why not bring in someone who could be quite engaging, like Joanna Kadi or whatnot.  Seriously, Greer is a big reason why I think it's useless to try and argue with TERFs. Their belief system is incompatible with trans realities. By design, their ideology views trans people as illegitimate, ad that cannot change without altering the core of their ideology, so they will never see trans men as real men, or trans women as real women. There is nothing to argue with them about because the endgame always remains the same. By design, their ideology states transphobia cannot exist. That is not a viewpoint compatible with understanding, compassion or empathy for trans people.  The best we can do is inform places holding those like her as speakers as to their viewpoints in hopes of swaying them to cancel those speakers. They may claim this as a silencing tactic, but it's one they were quite fond of using against trans people in the 70s and 80s (on top of militant threats of violence, etc.), so I figure they can't complain.

You'd think at least that would get through to her, that reducing women to body parts is innately anti-feminist, but somehow she doesn't see the contradiction, which drives me up a freaking wall.  Not to undermine the hatefullness of it, it's just that fucked up logic is my number 1 button push. I end up in frozen in a thatsnothowanyofthisworks.gif state before running off to one of the bad subs to scream my brains out. If you're going to be a hateful bigot, the very least you can do is be honest about it and not justify it with a logic bomb. And TERFs are the worst at this stuff.   They also especially suck because right up until trans issues come up, they seem like normal feminists. So they enter feminist groups with ease, and then the topic of conversations shifts, and you get to find out that the person you've let into the group and gotten to know is a transphobic bully. Now when someone wants to join a feminist group I leave a couple subtle things in conversation to see if they're racist or transphobic. Best to get it over with quickly and find out whether or not they deserve the time of day. I can't recommend it enough.

FemmeThoughts,2twds8,hermithome,36,Tue Jan 27 23:29:34 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm cautiously optimistic. It really, really, really, really depends on the writing. Sadly, I think its too easy for the all-female Ghostbusters film to end up being awfully sexist.   McCarthy is pretty much always pigeonholded into one of the awful stereotypes for fat women. I'm honestly scratching my head trying to think of anything she's been in since Gilmore Girls where she wasn't playing a really gross stereotype.   Jones...eh, I'm not a fan, at least, I'm not a fan of her writing and comedy. As an actor, I don't know.  I'd love an excellent all-female Ghostbusters remake where the women got to be real people, and the focus was, yanno, ghost-busting. But I know Hollywood, and so while I'm excited, I'm also internally cringing, bracing for the worst."

Hmm, see for me, one good moment or two doesn't weigh more than being a walking stereotype. I don't mind a character dealing with sexism or fatphobia in-universe, that makes sense. The problem is when its coming from the writers, and being written as a walking stereotype...damn. That's just something I have a really tough time getting over."
FemmeThoughts,2twds8,Rubbishnamenumerouno,5,Thu Jan 29 21:34:01 2015 UTC,"I see so many comments about Jones that just state the writer isn't keen. It's so foreign to me because she stands out massively as having pretty great comedy timing and presence. She's had a couple of misses on SNL (the sketch where she played opposite Chris Rock was all sorts of bad) but every time she comes on Weekend Update I know I'm gonna laugh. Man her standup is great and writing this just makes me want to go and watch it.   I know taste is subjective, but I always thought good comedic pace was obvious. I wish I knew what people didn't like about her."

FemmeThoughts,2twds8,hermithome,2,Wed Jan 28 05:29:57 2015 UTC,"Here's an opinion piece on the problem with the sketch and the larger problem that SNL has with racism, and here's another.  Here's an article on the twitter backlash and one on how the joke could have kicked up instead of down.  Her first bit on the show was one at the Update desk, where she started off by talking about Lupita Nyongo's People magazine cover. But then things went south:   “The way we value black beauty has changed. I’m single now, but back in the slave days, I would have never been single. I’m 6 feet tall and I’m strong. Look at me, I’m a Mandingo,” she said.  Jones was then asked by Jost if she wanted to be a slave:  “I do not want to be a slave. I don’t like working for all you white people now and you pay me. But back in the slave days, my love life would have been better. Master would have hooked me up with the best brotha on the plantation and every nine months I’d be in the corner popping out super babies. I’d just keep popping them out. Shaq. Kobe, LeBron, Kimbo Slice, Sinbad. I would be the number one slave draft pick. All of the plantations would want me,” she said. “Now, I can’t get a brotha to take me out for a cheap dinner. Can a bitch get a beef bowl?!!”   People didn't react well, given that what she was painting as a good love life, was actually, yanno, systematic gang rape. People were not happy about the way she white-washed the brutality and violence of slavery, and then used being black as her defence."
FemmeThoughts,2twds8,Rubbishnamenumerouno,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:00:15 2015 UTC,Is there a place in comedy for jokes of that nature?
FemmeThoughts,2twds8,hermithome,2,Thu Jan 29 22:35:59 2015 UTC,"Jokes of what nature? Jokes about slavery? Jokes about rape? Sure, as long as they're done well and kick up, not down. Most people fail at this part.  But if you're asking if there's a place in comedy for whitewashing the violence and brutality of slavery or painting brutal gendered violence as romance and love, then the answer is an unequivical no."
FemmeThoughts,2twds8,Rubbishnamenumerouno,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:47:44 2015 UTC,"No worries, I meant the former. However, what do you mean by 'kick up'. Is there an example of comedy combining the subjects of gender and slavery that does so? (I saw the examples of changed narrative the article you linked spoke of, but I'm wondering if there's a full fledged joke or sketch or stand-up routine handling those subjects and not kicking down.)  With regards to offensive comedy (jokes that cover offensive topics), where do you think the line is to determine whether it kicks up or down?   Thanks for having this discussion with me by the way. It's rare on Reddit to have a conversation about topics like this without a lot of kerfuffle. I'm genuinely interested in collecting the different views of comedy that people hold."
FemmeThoughts,2twds8,amelaine_,2,Thu Jan 29 23:31:57 2015 UTC,"""Kick up, not down"" or more accurately ""punch up, not down"" is describing who the joke targets. The reason most rape jokes are atrocious is because they tend to punch down. The punchline of the joke is the rape victim or rape itself. Few rape jokes kick up, and mock rapists, culture, the criminal justice system, and so on (ie. rape culture). Some do, but still manage to punch down: lol, those [insert ""third-world"" culture/non-JudeoChristian religion] are awful because they rape. Here the punch up at the rapists and rape culture is also a punch down because it's racist. It also tends to be a joke told in Western society, and ends up hurting those rape victims as well. Because Western society doesn't really have a rape problem, it's those ""savages"" elsewhere. :/  Rape jokes that punch up at the more powerful, at the actual problem, are rare. Jokes that do that without also punching down, or without also being so graphic and violent as to cause undue harm are rarer still.  I actually just had a conversation about this on reddit the other day, so I'm gonna link you to that.   With regards to offensive comedy (jokes that cover offensive topics), where do you think the line is to determine whether it kicks up or down?   For me, it's not about whether comedy covers a sensitive or offensive topic. It's a question of whether or not it does harm.   And yeah, there's great comedy that handles the intersection of slavery and gender. At least one of the articles I linked references the ""Ask A Slave"" series, which is HILARIOUS. Azie Mira Dungey is the comic behind this amazing series, and it's based on her time working as a living history character at Mount Vernon. Just give Season 1, Episode 1 a shot, and you'll see what I mean. Each episode is only 4 or 5 minutes, so try it. You'll be hooked.  Azie Dungey btw, also tried out for SNL, and they didn't hire her. People who knew these comics and were familiar with their work were pretty unhappy when the SNL casting was announced. Because yes, they'd finally hired more than one black woman at a time, and they'd hired black women writers as well, but they chose writers who would reinforce the show's racism, not ones who would disrupt it."

FemmeThoughts,2twds8,hermithome,2,Wed Jan 28 15:59:20 2015 UTC,Yup.  Also Keenan and Bobby.  But I get downright excited whenever Kate comes on.
FemmeThoughts,2twds8,littleprincessleia,11,Thu Jan 29 08:04:15 2015 UTC,"Here's why I think this Ghostbusters reboot will be amazing:  There is a grand total of ONE tentpole actor in a lead role here (I have a hard time with arguments that Wiig, an SNL veteran with one monster hit starring role, is a tentpole actor).  Here's how i'm thinking of it: How many of these actors are on top 5 (ratings-wise C+7) network primetime sitcoms that perform well on all demographics? One (McCarthy). How many of these actors have STARRED in more than one well-selling tentpole movie in the past 5 years? One (McCarthy). How many of these actors are worth more than $20 million? One (McCarthy, though Wiig is close at ~$14 million, but that only spiked after Bridesmaids' success). So you've got 3 actors who've proven they're funny (McKinnon is a favorite on SNL, as is Jones [more for her long rants than her acting], Wiig's long-term body of work speaks for itself), and ONE actor who's used to the big-budget, tentpole movie lifestyle. Of those four total actors, for 2 of them, EVERYTHING is on the line:  Jones has experienced backlash over how similar ALL her characters are on SNL (and was featured in what some critics have called the worst SNL sketch ever made during the Chris Rock episode), and it's been widely speculated that McKinnon cannot live outside of SNL, so for them, they'll have to put their best foot forward. For Wiig, her popularity has plateaued since Bridesmaids. So all 3 of these actors need to prove that they're ready for a long-term commitment to the film industry (which pays and treats you far better than TV in most cases, unless you're in a show like McCarthy's), so, if I know the industry like i think i might, they're going to have to put their best feet forward. And Bridesmaids has shown us that Feig/Wiig are not afraid of making female comedy dirty, real, and outlandish (and i mean that in a good way). Could not be more excited for this."
FemmeThoughts,2twds8,hermithome,-1,Wed Jan 28 01:30:38 2015 UTC,"What? Like, what the fuck?  I'll accept your theory that these actors need to prove themselves. I'm not sure I'd agree, but for the sake of argument, let's say that's true. So what? They're actors. The script, and the director is what will break the film. Odds are, the script will suck, and be super sexist and super tropey and super fatphobic. It might by dirty and outlandish, but it'll be tropey crap. I have no idea why you think that the actors are going to control the characters but that's just not at all how it works."
FemmeThoughts,2twds8,corgiroll,8,Wed Jan 28 04:10:57 2015 UTC,"Literally any one thing can make or break a film, actors included. You're right that since none of the female leads in the reboot are big ""A-listers,"" they probably won't have any say over the characters. However, I am hoping they had enough sense to read the script prior to getting on-board.  I'll preface this with the fact that I haven't seen Bridesmaids, but why do you feel so strongly that the writing will be crap? I'm not familiar with her work either, but according to IMDB Katie Dippold is also a writer. So it's not just Feig.  Maybe I'm just being optimistic but the fact that this movie is even getting made with a female cast is fucking amazing to me."
FemmeThoughts,2tu5hk,Kookaburrachick,39,Tue Jan 27 13:19:37 2015 UTC,I think we need a better vocabulary around rape.

He was stronger than me, and I knew that if I pushed it further and really asserted myself that no I didn't want it, he would break up with me, or pull his usual emotional manipulation. When we first started dating I was 17 and I've found diary entries where I say 'I tried to push him off and told him no but he thought I just meant slow down and he kept going'.

FemmeThoughts,2tu5hk,itchyivy,15,Tue Jan 27 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"The cynical side of me wonders if this is why there are so many men pushing back against the idea of enthusiastic consent, because honestly, what is wrong with the idea that you should definitely want to have sex with your partner, and they should definitely want to have sex with you? Surely that's a win-win for everyone; why would you want to have sex with someone who doesn't want to have sex with you? Instead, you get all these strawman arguments saying, ""OMG feminists want us to fill out forms in triplicate before we can have sex!!!"". So, the only real way I can square it in my head is that the guys who make those arguments are the same guys who are coercing their partners; manipulating them, not stopping when there isn't a clear no, pestering and badgering until their partner finally gives in. They realise that the way they get sex is by using these techniques which would not be permitted under an enthusiastic consent model, and instead of thinking, ""huh, maybe there is a problem with the way I approach sex and consent"", instead decide to deal with that cognitive dissonance by attempting to discredit the model that is calling them out on their shitty behaviour."
FemmeThoughts,2tu5hk,speaksincolor,6,Tue Jan 27 22:23:45 2015 UTC,I think that- coupled with preying on women with low self esteem. It's honestly sickening to think about. But I think you're right. The only guy that would condone that behavior is a guy that himself would perform the behavior.

Like, as a white trans woman, I do my best to get the word out there that they need a hell of a lot of help in all areas, from having the violence against the recognizes, having it prevented, fought against, and its perpetrators prosecuted.   And yet, they're so widely ignored, and it's a serious issue. If a white woman was decapitated, it wouldn't take 3+ days for the police to get around to identifying her. If a white cis woman was murdered while walking down the street, she wouldn't be assumed to be a sex worker like black women (specifically black trans women, but it's a major issue for black cis women and cis woc too). There's so much social devaluation, especially in the media, of women across racial and gender identity intersects.  And it's terribly sad to hear that black trans women were pressured out of larger black political protests due to transphobia. This is a time for uplifting a whole diversity of black narratives to push that black lives matter.

FemmeThoughts,2tkd2k,AppleSpicer,3,Sun Jan 25 04:03:31 2015 UTC,"Talk to him. Your feelings are valid and no one can tell you how you ought to react. Be true to yourself. Think about what boundaries you want in your relationship. Ask him about the nature of his interaction with these gals and discuss what boundaries you both must have in the relationship. If one of you can't meet those then it's that person's choice. Boundaries aren't compromised by definition. It's something you need in your relationship, though they may change as you reevaluate them. Be open to reevaluate your boundaries but they are your boundaries and don't change based on other's wishes or to meet other's boundaries. Relationships are mostly communication so if something makes you uncomfortable it's important to be open. Otherwise neither of you will be on the same page and can't make an informed decision to be together."
FemmeThoughts,2tkd2k,softinseattle,6,Sun Jan 25 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"i feel like there's a big difference between looking at porn and looking at porn made by someone you actually know. in the first case, you can get off but the chances of hooking up with james deen or stoya or whatever and it ruining your relationship are super small. if you're getting off on pictures that a classmate took, you're setting up a much more dangerous situation, where the infatuation could actually lead to flirting or more."

You don't trust him period, and you're just looking for ways to lock him up so he'll never get the opportunity. That's not healthy.  Looking doesn't mean that he wants to cheat."

FemmeThoughts,2tkd2k,HPCumberdale,5,Sun Jan 25 08:26:02 2015 UTC,"It's great that you realized that your reaction relates to deeper issues and you're going to seek counseling; however, I don't think you should pin this entirely on yourself. I am only posting because I worry that women often feel the need to blame themselves for having negative reactions, when some responsibility does lie with their partner for the behavior that invoked that reaction. Your bf looking at these pictures does seem akin to looking at porn. But viewing porn is something that one typically does in private, unless they specifically invite their partner to view with them. Perhaps some couples are comfortable doing private activities like that while the partner is around, but not actively involved, but I think that is probably the result of open communication rather than an assumption that one's partner won't, or shouldn't, care. Personally, I would feel pretty uncomfortable if I glanced at my partner's laptop and saw him browsing through sexy pictures of other women while I was right there! And I would be conscientious enough not to engage in activities like that in front of him. I think your bf was at least careless and maybe a bit insensitive when he called you over and scrolled through all the pictures on IG that he'd clearly been keeping up with. And I think a lot of women would feel uncomfortable with being put in that situation. It's great that you talked about it with him, but I just wanted to put in my two cents that you don't necessarily need to pathologize your response.  But, regardless of all that, I think it's great that you're developing your awareness of the effects that your trauma has on you and that you're willing to work on that. And I don't mean to imply that your bf isn't a great guy for being understanding of your trauma and willing to talk things out!"
FemmeThoughts,2tkd2k,thescreamingwind,2,Sun Jan 25 20:38:12 2015 UTC,I agree with you completely tbh. I didn't let him off the hook for this. I confronted him about his looking at other pictures.

He probably found her account because he used to know her and thought ""Hey, sexy pictures. I should keep an eye on this."" If he were thinking about cheating, I seriously doubt he would have been comfortable just pulling up her account like that. The fact that he was supportive of you afterwards and wanted to make you feel better is a good sign.  A couples therapist is a great idea. Good luck to you and your boyfriend."
FemmeThoughts,2tkd2k,Shaysdays,2,Mon Jan 26 00:47:32 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna second this. If sounds like you have a great supportive boyfriend, but iproper communication is really important. Looking at sexy pictures of women isn't inherently wrong or bad. Doing it knowing that the other person isn't okay with it is where it's a problem. If couples therapy isn't an option, at least work on openly communicating. Without good communication, two people who really do love each other can constantly be hurting the other person unintentionally, and hurting themselves by trying to make things good."

I find it bizarre how people always advise not to bring up religion or politics on a first date. And yet, those things are hugely important to many people. The idea that you should not discuss your values until things are going well is backward in the extreme.  About once a month or so, there's a post on /r/SRSWomen where a woman has just discovered that her partner is anti-feminist or racist. Often the couple is already married. And the story is always the same. An issue came up that revealed what he thought, she tried to discuss it with him, didn't get anywhere and is coming to /r/SRSWomen for advice on how to get through to him.  You're talking about a relationship, a partnership. One that could last your entire life. It's not at all too harsh to want someone who shares your values. If you don't have someone who shares your values, one of you is going to end up sacrificing their value system for the sake of the other person.   Because I thought that the foundation of a good relationship is shared values and compatible personalities. Am I doing something wrong if I am having trouble finding someone who shares my core values such as feminism and gender equality?   Maybe. What sort of circles do you run in? How feminist are your friends and co-workers? How are you meeting men?   We actually have a bunch of threads on dating feminist men, and how to find them, so you may find good advice in some of these:   men who are feminist, left leaning, nice/empathetic/not afraid to have emotions, outgoing, and athletic make my ovaries explode. My friends say those are unrealistic expectations for dating because 'men like that are ahead of their time'. What do you think? I want to know how to find 'my people' while being active in my community though volunteering/hobbies etc. How do you ladies do that? I want to meet other feminists and left leaning people. I realized that the guy I'm dating doesn't believe in gender equality as much as I thought at all! And now I am no longer sexuality attracted to him. This keeps happening! What is wrong with me?! I want to date a feminist/empathetic/critical thinking/emotionally intelligent/Good Guy Greg guy. Bonus points if he has nice biceps ;) Where do I find such a man? Or is it just random?"

FemmeThoughts,2thsc2,sadsackpeople,13,Sat Jan 24 07:00:08 2015 UTC,"""The feminists of the sexual revolution are likely disappointed that it’s taking this long, and that we still see a version of the Madonna/whore-now-hookup/girlfriend dichotomy...""   I think this is still sadly the case. Women who do random hook ups with men are seen as dirty and slutty; basically they're reduced to cum-dumpsters. Instead of seeing these women as mutual/equal partners and getting each other off, the couple spends all of their energy into what ""sex is supposed to be,"" i.e. getting the man to ejaculate. I don't think most men refuse to get women off out of malice, after all, they're just responding to the chauvinism that already permeates our culture. Women also learn to associate their bodies with frustration because apparently sex education of the vagina and clitoris is lacking.  However, I'm not as optimistic as the author. I don't think the ""orgasm gap"" will shrink without overhauling our definitions of sex. If we only teach people that sex is sinful, then sex will always be viewed as ""wrong,"" and the madonna/whore complex will rage on. People need to understand their own bodies and learn to respect the bodies of others. No amount of relationships will cure cultural chauvinism."
FemmeThoughts,2thsc2,thescreamingwind,3,Sat Jan 24 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"I have actually experienced a different reaction than Madonna/whore.    I personally don't enjoy random hooks ups and the only reason is that I cannot orgasm from them for whatever reason. The friends I know who like hook ups are the women who can orgasm easily and quickly.  I wish I could enjoy hookups, they seem fun :/  But I am terrible at organisming.  I just dont liek hookups because I get nothing out of them and like the article says, men do - they at least get an orgasm.    Though I certainly do not think that random hookups are morally wrong or should be seen as such, they aren't for everyone - lots of people (men and women) dont like having sex with someone they dont know very well or will never see again, if they find it harder to enjoy the sex this way - because enjoyment is the whole point of sex.  I too would like to see the definition of 'what sex is supposed to be' really widen.  Some people like random hook ups while others prefer sex within a longer term friends with benefits  or romantic relationship.   Everyone is different and that's ok.  Some of my friends have called me prudish for not hooking up all the time.  But I have tried it - lots and lots of times until I finally gave up on then because ! I couldn't orgasm from it and it wasn't fun for me."

Its not the only reason women associate bodies with frustration. I agree but it is also that pervasive view that the female body doesn't exist for anyone else but men and that to be female (have female genetalia) means you are a second class citizen (just like black children hate their blackness) So you know, you get deep body self-hate, for simply being born female."

I find that I am more likely to orgasm with lots of foreplay and with a guy that I like or care about. Am I supposed to be able to orgasm at the drop of a hat, even with a random hookup? I wonder if I have some type of mind block. How do I get rid of it?    THe article says that it's because women don't feel entitled to orgasms and their partners dont feel pressure to get them off.  But many of my sexual partners have been really good at making sure the sex was equally about me, so this makes me wonder.  But still, I am suprised by the responces of people intereivewd for this artile.  The women said they felt rude asking for an orgasm while the men said they only gave a shit about her orgasm if she  was a girlfriend and not a random hookup.  I have never felt this way or dating a guy like that.  I'm not skilled at giving myself an orgasm, but I still expect him to care about my pleasure and I dont feel bad about asking.  IF he didn't care about my pleasure, I would take that as a red flag: ie he might be jerk.  Maybe it's because I am reaching the end of my twenties? as I get older, I dont take shit from people as much.  IT makes me so sad that some women cannot expect pleasure from sex and that some men dont care to give it to them.  Why have sex if there is no pleasure?!"

I do notice while dating around about maybe 1/3 of the men care about my orgasm. I make a point to just be blunt about it and tell them if they don't even try, because my clit is a fickle mistress, then I""m not going to try either and I'll just be going home.

Yeast infection medications, unless they're prescription, are not covered.  It kind of blows my mind.  Truly, most of society seems to view this as a curse that we must bear.  Nobody's helping us deal with it.  Nobody's providing pads and tampons-which becomes a huge barrier for homeless women and women in developing countries.

FemmeThoughts,2tgiea,Wrecksomething,11,Sat Jan 24 02:27:55 2015 UTC,"The current accepted article introduction seems pretty fair:   The Gamergate controversy, centering on a debate about sexism in video game culture, came to public attention beginning in August 2014 because of ongoing harassment and threats, primarily targeting women in the video game industry. Many supporters of the self-described Gamergate movement say that they are concerned about ethical issues in video game journalism, but media commentary has primarily focused on the attacks by Gamergate supporters, which have been broadly condemned as sexist and misogynistic. Gamergate is often seen as a manifestation of a culture war against targets such as women, the diversification of gaming culture, recognition of video games as an art form, social criticism of video games as a medium, and the way in which these things threaten the traditional gamer identity.  The controversy began after indie game developer Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend alleged that Quinn had a romantic relationship with Nathan Grayson, a journalist for the video game news site Kotaku. Quinn was then subjected to severe misogynistic harassment, including false accusations that the relationship had led to positive coverage of Quinn's game. A number of gaming industry members supportive of Quinn were also subjected to harassment, threats of violence, and the malicious broadcasting of personally identifiable information about them (doxing); some of them fled their homes. The targets were mostly women, and included Quinn, feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian, and indie game developer Brianna Wu. The harassment came from social media users, particularly those from 4chan, 8chan and Reddit using the #gamergate hashtag. These attacks often include anti-feminist and misogynistic rhetoric, and have heightened discussion of sexism and misogyny in the gaming community.  Gamergate supporters have been unwilling to move beyond the unorganized, leaderless and anonymous origins which has resulted in an inability to control the behavior and messaging of those acting under the Gamergate hashtag. While some have said that they are concerned with ethics in video game journalism, some members launched a campaign to convince ad providers to pull support from sites critical of Gamergate and others continue to harass those they perceive as opponents. Gamergate's origins in false allegations of ethics violations and the subsequent harassment campaign targeting Quinn and others, its failure to identify significant ethical issues in games media, and its frequent criticism of game critics who discuss issues of gender, class, and politics in their reviews have also been cited as evidence that the ethics concerns are a front for a culture war against the diversification of video game demographics."

Even a lyrical genius like Bjork has to insist to people that she writes her own work! Heck, even Grimes, who manipulates her tracks live while playing a keyboard and singing, is subject to it.

Completely aside from the notion that abortion restrictions violate a woman's right over her own body, they are medically necessary to protect the life of the mother in many cases. This bill strips health care from women, both poor and on assistance, and professional working women who get their health through their employers.

There are a few things that discomfort me about the whole thing:   Kind of like how PUAs on Reddit picked up the term ""the red pill,"" it seems impossible to call yourself ""Pro-Life"" without being associated with a movement that is really ""Pro-Birth."" That ""Life"" label seeks to belittle supporters of bodily autonomy as ""Anti-Life."" What the hell?! Aren't the majority of people ""for life""!? This just tricks young people into thinking that denying abortion rights is the ""right thing to do,"" leading to more women being shamed for exercising their rights. I've been hearing a lot of talk in the media (or maybe just on campus) that our generation is the new ""Pro-Life Generation."" I don't want to be part of the generation that overturns Roe v. Wade, and have to explain to my posterity why my generation gave way to so many back-alley abortions. Ugh. You don't often hear a lot of progressive-thought on our campus, and if there's any progressive issues that get swept under the rug, it's normally women's rights, Transsexual rights, and LGBTQ rights. Moreover, bringing up abortion rights would be nearly impossible here, as 1) any club advocating a Pro-Choice stance would not be approved (believe me, I tried), 2) everyone here is so unanimously ""Pro-Life"" that no debates about it ever happen on campus, and 3) if anything hinting at Pro-Choice thought is brought up, it will be likely be ignored by our newspaper unless we got a significant amount of people involved. Hell, I even tried starting a Feminist club on campus, and when I met with potential officers, they suggested sweeping abortion rights discussions under the rug, along with anything that may come off as ""anti-catholic.""   Our school, as glorious as it is, makes it really hard, if not impossible, to bring dissenting opinions to the table. Don't get me started on our single-sex dorms."

FemmeThoughts,2tda5i,theaftstarboard,1 point,Sun Jan 25 01:56:44 2015 UTC,"Please forgive me for this rant. I hurt as a woman because I grew up in an abusive family that did not cherish me as a child much less a girl. Life is harder for me. I never had support for college. I was grossly unprepared for adult life. In high school I was bullied, and I was called a dyke because I was a nationally ranked athlete. I've been isolated, and I dislike how people disregard me because I don't have a marriage or  a mortgage or a salaried job or a trust fund from daddy. I'm a hard working person, with very high standards. I ran 7 miles yesterday at 9 min pace (last mile at 7:30 pace) alone. I got myself out of not one but two really abusive situations. All by myself. I finished community college with no FAFSA, now I'm $7000 in debt for nothing. I feel like women do this thing to each-other, where they judge eachother on their femininity and their ""demure-ness"" and the amount of money and fashionable items they have and I know this is just how it appears to me (I don't know what my problem is, and I'm saying this is just my stupid brain making stupid assumptions) but I hate feeling so rejected by these shallow things. I have no female friends and I try so hard to relate but I just don't. I don't like joining mini-cults of personality where no-one is ever allowed to be upset with the queen of the group. I don't identify as caregiver. I don't put others first in my life. I've learned the hard way to put myself first, and it feels like other women don't like that. I'm not queer, so even though I'm a bit gender-fluid (and bi), I am also not fully accepted by the queer women I know, because I don't fit the stereotypes they have and I don't compromise myself and my identity in order to fit in. I'm also atheist/agnostic, so I definitely don't get along with religious women, even the new age ones. I really wish I could feel healed from the things that happened to me in the past, and being accepted just by one woman for who I am, would make a huge difference to me. I already accept all the people in my life for who they are, why can't they do the same for me?   Please understand if anything I'm saying is taken as sexist I will re write this. This is just been how I feel regarding women as a woman. I feel harshly judged. Perhaps I look like or act like a pollyanna or a female peter pan, I don't know. Truth is, I just haven't been given the same messages as most women and thus I feel like I see the world completely differently then most women, and thus I cannot relate.    Tl:dr: I just really want a female friend, to accept me for what I am, accept me as a woman, acknowledge me as a woman, even though I don't fit the stereotypes of what a woman is."

Almost every event where alcohol is served is generally illegal (since most students are under the drinking age and a fraternity and probably sorority won't stop its own underage members from drinking) so any group that does throw a party is taking a huge risk (both in terms of legal risks including fines from the police and legal action from those present at or harmed by the event and in terms of censure from their university or national chapter which could lead to the chapter being closed)."

Considering two of our fraternities got kicked off campus my sophomore year (one for animal abuse and one because it was the second time an 18 year old got alcohol poisoning at their house), it was a good warning. Besides, the culture of my university was to go to the bars or clubs. Most of the official events were at clubs.

The habits of ""how this dating thing works"" are deeply ingrained -- though I seem to see that younger women are breaking these patterns  more often, hooray hooray!    There are a whole host of things that guys aren't ""supposed"" to want in the bedrooms or in their lives, because they don't fit the masculine ideal.  Every few months, there'll be someone on reddit asking if it's weird for him to be attracted to muscular women, or saying that he has shameful dreams about some woman picking him up and having her way with him -- classic female fantasies, but often times ""shameful"" for a guy to have.    I agree with this author's basic premise, that men have constraints around their acceptable sexuality, too.

IF men felt less pressure to be masculine, and women felt less pressure to be feminine,  I dont think we would feel a DRAMATIC  shift in bedroom activities or how we look at sexuality.  For example, small percentage of people cannot actually get off on being anything except at 'dominant' or a 'submissive' in bed because it is so connected with their sexuality.    BUT for most people, even those who have done a lot of experimentation with BDSM, sexual desires are fluid and they change each time you have sex depending on what you feel like - like food - you 'feel like' something different every day.   Sometimes I like being dominated in bed a little by a guy, sometimes I like being in charge, sometimes I like an equal sharing of power during the sex.  Sometimes I like rough sex, others I like gentle, romantic sex.  Same with men - I think that sometimes they like being the 'dom' and sometimes they like being the 'sub' and sometimes neither, and some man aren't even concerned with power dynamics during sex at all.    Experimenting with power dynamics during sex or identifying as a dom or sub is not the same as a sexual orientation - it is more fluid.  Besides, I dont think that 'men being more comfy with their sexuality ' would suddenly be some sort of golden ticket for equality and feminism. However I think it would be one small factor that would make things just a little bit better.  I just dont think it is a root cause"

FemmeThoughts,2t45pc,schnapple1,0,Wed Jan 21 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with the idea but not that it will cure the patriarchy or something. Religions will still exist, for example.   I do however believe that we need to acknowledge both men and women hurt from sexual taboos. Acknowledging and freeing men from their sexual shames will go a long way. I really believe this. It won't cure it, but it will go a long way towards a better society.   I had an interesting debate on /femrad with a guy who was claiming that mass shootings are linked to men not getting (basically) sucked off by enough women. (Excuse my crudeness, this is basically what he was arguing.) I DISAGREE HUGELY.  The reason so many men hurt themselves and others, is because the anger is linked to SHAME regarding sexual release, not SCARCITY OF sexual release.  This is because the ideal maleness as related to sexuality is supposed to be 1)Monogamous 2) Married (and controlling) 3) Vanilla (no porn, no masturbation, no kink) 4) Free (no prostitution) and 5) Cis/Straight  And the truth is when you are told all forms of sexual release besides cis/straight, monogamous, procreation-only, dominating, vanilla, controlling, property-owning male sex is something you should be ashamed of, THAT is how you end up with characters who HATE ALL SOCIETY and HATE THEMSELVES not  just a vulnerable group.  I am not kidding that I read stuff on r/SW where guys are SUICIDAL because of SEXUAL SHAME. Be it rejection by a woman, (because that makes you less of a male, to be rejected by a female) or even the FEAR that they can only ever have masturbation as release, or that they are non-masculine (beta?whatever-the-fuck) therefore they are literally DOOMED for a lonely life....all these things are based on a perception of shame.   Sexual shaming to me is the root of so much evil in the world. It's shame regarding to even speaking about sex that gets men assuming consent isn't important...because we DON'T EVEN DARE TO TALK ABOUT IT OPENLY.  Edit: I thought I might add, I'm not excusing any behavior by males or anyone. Also, I am female. Also I don't understand why this is being downvoted. This is my direct experiences that I've had, going ""undercover"" and lurking on places where men congregate. I'm not saying this is an okay view that men have. This is not okay, and it should change. I also hope that you understand I'm speaking of intersectional sexual shaming. Which I don't know if you people all live in the liberal states or something, but it is a HUGE problem in conservative communities, which is MASSIVE parts of American society. Both men and women are HORRIBLY HORRIBLY sexually repressed. I've lived in Utah, among the Mormons, and it's really bad. I've spoken and am friends with MANY x-JW's, x-baptists, x-Mormons and x-Catholics. Men get sexual shame too, and its just as harmful to the causes of feminism as the sexual shaming of women. In fact, I know someone who left the Catholic church (many many men have done this) because he REFUSED to conform to treating women as less than him. Again and last but not least, I do spend a lot of time on subforums for mentally ill people (neuro-atypicals like myself) and its really really SCARY to me how many men have these FUCKED UP shame narratives about being NON-MASCULINE and NOT GETTING LAID A MILLION BILLION TIMES. Its really messed up, and I try to talk them out of their messed up myths regarding what real love is, and what life really is, and how you do have to work hard if you want sex. Women aren't supposed to just lie at your feet..."
FemmeThoughts,2t45pc,theaftstarboard,6,Wed Jan 21 19:54:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of what you're saying, but I don't think the whole reason men are more voilent than women is because they feel sexually trapped. Though they probably feel like they have pressure to fit the male gender role during sex. I don't see men being shamed for having an active sexlife with multible partners they same women is. But as you're saying most of them feel like they have to be the dominant during sex to not feel ashamed as a man. We need to break genderroles and teach men that it's ok to not always be dominant and that being submissive during sex is not something shameful. It's just two people having fun."
FemmeThoughts,2t45pc,theaftstarboard,1 point,Thu Jan 22 16:18:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see men being shamed for having an active sexlife with multible partners they same women is   I think you made an assumption about what kind of shame I was talking about. Male shame is there, its just in the opposite way as how women are shamed. I don't think promiscuity is the real problem when it comes to things like mass shootings. I think the shame is shame of NOT having an active sex life, especially one that conforms to gender roles such as domination, having beautiful women lying at your feet, cumming every time, not ever having to lift a finger and work on a relationship etc, having a marriage, having approval of your family regarding sex and being openly applauded for your conquests. These things are all expectations that people like Elliot Roger's felt they couldn't meet. And thus they were ashamed. Next, because they were unstable and prone to violence, they projected that shame onto others and acted out in violence. So the shame I'm talking about is a shame of NOT HAVING those things. Very much like you would expect toddlers to react when they see a commercial that says all boys love toy cars, and they don't get a toy car EXACTLY the color they want. This is how the patriarchy is unhealthy. Boys are taught to expect everything and so when they don't get things the way they want, they are FAILURES as men. And this is especially true in regards to NON-CIS/STRAIGHT monogamous sex. And that pressure to not be a failure and win the no1 spot creates cheaters. It's because our masculinity is hyper-masculine, and our femininity is hyper-feminine. This causes no balance in between. So if you have a group of guys and one guy gets the girl, the rest hate him because they felt they had an equal chance as him to ""win"" the woman and ""score."" They feel entitled to it, but not only that, they feel SHAMED for not having it. It's consumer culture writ large. Except we are expected to consume women. So men who don't feel like being that way, or can't get the women to lay at their feet like there ""supposed to"" feel shame, and shame leads to anger, which leads to hate which leads to suicide, rape, stealing, cheating, murder etc...(i'm not excusing murderers etc....I just wish we had a healthier society, and I'm trying to explain to you what I was really meaning...which I'm actually not sure how you didn't get that.)"

I'm just saying that I don't feel like (although it's a big problem) sex is the whole reason men act voilently. I think the macho ideal is behind it.

Sexual shame is the problem not a scarcity of sex. Like I was saying before. Macho ideals are sexual expectations. What creates it is a dynamic of sexual power that men are expected to display openly to eachother and to the world, or else they are failures as men.   Remember I said this in the beginning:   the anger is linked to SHAME regarding sexual release, not SCARCITY OF sexual release.   So I really don't understand what we are arguing about, why I got downvoted at all, and why you are upset with what I'm saying. I've re-read it many times, so I don't get what the problem is.

Macho ideals are more than just sex, it's also keeping your feelings locked away from the public and not seeking help when it's needed   I totally agree! The point is it is an attractiveness ideal, which is related to sex. If you are less of a man, then you are considered sexually impotent, gay, or otherwise undesirable. Which all connects back to sexual and gender shaming."

Don’t criticise misogyny in porn or people will say you’re sexually repressed; don’t criticise it in comedy or they’ll say you’re humourless; don’t criticise it in art or they’ll say you’re stupid.   I felt like this was spot-on. I hate watching certain stand-up comedians with people, being the only one who isn't laughing because it's actually appallingly sexist and I don't find that humorous, and have to tolerate them explaining that it's just a joke, it's actually tongue-in-cheek, what he's really trying to say is...  No, I get it. It was a joke, and the joke was based on sexism, and I don't find that funny.  One of my favorite books was written by a guy who's basically a misogynist and whose works are definitely permeated by that. And I made the judgment that the sexism in that book is a flaw, but one outweighed by other merits. I'm capable of making that judgment--so I'm sick of having to defend ""that book was misogynistic and I don't think it deserves all that praise"" when talking about other books, having to explain that yes, I understand what the author was doing, yes, I get the point, yes, it's still sexist and I don't support it."

FemmeThoughts,2sz3br,thescreamingwind,16,Sun Jan 25 01:26:33 2015 UTC,"One of the best things to do with misogynistic comedy is to make the other person spell it out. They think you don't get it? Fine, make them explain it to you. Sit there, and say that you want to understand, explain the joke.   That gives them one of two options: go red faced and back off, or plainly state the misogyny: ""see its funny because women are ____"".  And I'm with you. I've got movies and books and stuff that I love, but that I'm aware is appallingly sexist. I can still find the good qualities. I can make a judgement. And guys will respect that. But heaven forbid I find something misogynistic and not that good. Then clearly, my ability to judge has been compromised."
FemmeThoughts,2sz3br,hermithome,13,Tue Jan 20 13:01:59 2015 UTC,"That's similar to a tactic that I was taught when volunteering to be an orientation leader at university.  Kids (because first years, 17-18yo at best are in fact still kids most of the time) are going to say racially insensitive jokes, even though they're probably surrounded by non-white people even in the orientation groups, because all students are from 3 possible places in my country: foreign countries (probably won't tell racist jokes), big cities (probably won't tell racist jokes) or small almost entirely white communities (probably haven't ever in their lives been called out for racist jokes).  So we were told to ask them why the joke was funny.  Ask them to explain the joke.  They probably won't bother and might get embarassed or they'll attempt to explain and might notice that an East Indian or an Asian or an African person is looking at them, and recognize that it's saying something that generalizes and negatively describes an entire group.    It worked too.  I was a group leader so would have extra attention from the frosh, and sometimes would get the commentary/jokes from kids as we were walking from one place to another in small packs, or whatever, and I never once had a kid try to defend an offensive joke.  It's a good time to learn that lesson too.  Better to learn it in a safe environment when everyone's having fun than to have someone file a complaint about you and you get hauled into an RA meeting or have to complete a mandatory sensitivity course in order to not get tossed into another house.  In Canada, almost everyone's white in the small towns, but it's probably only just over half the university population that's white and much less than half male (even the schools that focus on undergrad programs in STEM where the female population is noticeably smaller are lucky if they break 45% male).  I'm from a small town myself, and went to a high school with less than 50 non-white students (out of 1600 total) in it, so I know where they're coming from, but it's no excuse to wear bigotry like a small town badge of honour when they're supposed to be the educated ones."
FemmeThoughts,2sz3br,gmule,8,Tue Jan 20 15:15:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  And if they do defend it, it forces the issue. The whole ""its just a joke"" bit, the entire purpose of that is to sidestep the bigotry. Bigotry isn't an issue, your sense of humour is.   When a guy makes a sexist joke or a rape joke, and everyone is laughing, just about the only way to actually get your point across about sexism is to make him say exactly what he means, without the laugh track that makes it go down so easy. You can literally see guys open their eyes as they hear the joke again without the laugh and realise it's just something super gross.   It's like a song that's super catchy but the lyrics are super awful. You can sing along without really clicking as to what it means, but once you actually hear it, it's impossible to forget.   For me the big moment like that was with a Beatles song when I was a kid.   run for your life if you can, little girl hide your head in the sand, little girl catch you with another man, that's the end of little girl   But I sung the song a bunch, not really clicking. And then one day, it suddenly clicked and I was just nauseated. And I think it's like that with jokes too. You have to force the brain to really hear what's being said. Just telling someone often isn't enough. They get that you hear it that way, but they didn't hear it that way, so it doesn't resonate."

I would hate for you or me or anyone to ""call out"" someone like this and have them intricately explain that their joke is meant to use misogyny to highlight the ridiculousness of itself."

FemmeThoughts,2sz3br,Wittgenfine,4,Tue Jan 20 19:19:04 2015 UTC,"Well, it's your judgement call. They may intend to use misogyny as satire. The question is: do they achieve it? And, do they achieve it without causing more harm?  Here's a link to a post from last week, that I think is worth a read. The article linked goes into intricate detail explaining why Charlie Hebdo is in fact satire, and yet still racist and still kicking down.  For me, punch up, not down is the golden rule. Most rape jokes punch down, it's the rape victim, or rape itself that's the joke. Few rape jokes punch up, and mock rapists, culture, the criminal justice system, and so on (ie. rape culture). Some do, but still manage to punch down: lol, those [insert ""third-world"" culture/non-JudeoChristian religion] are awful because they rape. Rape jokes that punch up at the more powerful, at the actual problem are rare. Jokes that do that without also punching down, or without also being so graphic and violent as to cause undue harm are rarer still.  Jokes employing misandry are ironic because misandry isn't real. It's absurd. It's kicking up. Jokes employing misogyny, more often than not, tend to kick down. And even when they do try to kick up, they might kick up and down. And kicking down in the service of kicking up isn't cool, at least IMO.   A month or so ago, a bit from /r/standupshots was posted to /r/trollxchromosomes and heavily upvoted. And the comic's intention was obviously to mock misogyny and double standards. But he went about it in a way that I found pretty misogynistic. His post and my comment. Some people found the joke funny. Some people found the joke funny and misogynistic. Some found it misogynistic and not funny. But the point is, they're all entitled to their opinions. The problem is when some opinions are dismissed as invalid, because the person is ""sensitive"" or ""doesn't get it"".   It's okay to criticise, or ""call out"" someone's work and have people disagree. In fact, it's pretty much a requirement, f you're a woman and calling-out something for being sexist. I'm reminded of a powerful, and uncomfortable article about John Stewart responding to a question on his show using a racist warm-up comedian. I think a large part of how someone reacts to criticism tells you who they are. Do they try and silence you using their power and privilege? Do they critique your tone, instead of answering your criticism? Do they dismiss you are irrelevant? Do they casually threaten you? Or do they listen?   They don't have to agree. But if you find that a comic's work makes you vastly uncomfortable because of their misogyny, or use of misogyny then it's okay to criticism them. Maybe their joke is intended to kick up, and they'll say that. But comedian's know better than just about everyone that intent doesn't count for much. Every person goes up there and tries to be funny. But becoming a comic is in large part about bombing, and realising what doesn't work and trying again. And again, and again. Maybe their explanation will satisfy you. Maybe you'll say ""I didn't see that aspect before"" or ""I wasn't aware of X that you were trying to mock"". Maybe you'll agree with them. There's no shame in that. You had an opinion and they managed to change your mind. And maybe they won't. And that's okay. You're entitled to your opinion, and your criticism. And your opinion should be respected as valid, not dismissed as sensitive or stupid. That's entirely what this article is about.    Okay wow, this ended up being a super long comment, and I linked a LOT of things. You don't need to read it all, but I can't recommend enough the article on John Stewart, and the article on Charlie Hebdo."

The book is about two terrible people doing terrible things, and the less terrible person loses because fuck the world. It's dark and twisted and a good read, and...I'm pretty sure that's all. I think attributing some sort of misogynistic slant to it is a mistake.  The point of the book is that people are shitty, and shitty people will get ahead if they're smart enough. Cynical, sure...but not misogynistic.  I hate sexism in creative mediums as much as the next person, but I think we're too quick to take up arms against every female character there is. She's too nice? BENEVOLENT SEXISM. She's a vicious bitch? THIS FUCKER HATES WOMEN. She's somewere in the middle, just sort of coasting along?

FemmeThoughts,2sz3br,prosthetic_ass_farts,5,Tue Jan 20 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the book or seen the movie (I have little desire to do either), but I also don't think you can take a piece of writing or film and analyse it in a vacuum. Note, this comment miraculously manages to be pretty-much spoiler free, so if you're interested in criticism without the spoiler read on (but don't click the link!)  I've read a fair bit about Gone Girl, and frankly, this description of the main character seems pretty apt:   [She] is the crystallisation of a thousand misogynist myths and fears about female behaviour. If we strapped a bunch of men’s rights advocates to beds and downloaded their nightmares, I don’t think we’d come up with stuff half as ridiculous as this plot.   I recommend this article on Gone Girl, largely because it's such a good collection of the various criticisms and really manages to lay out the environment in which the film was received. And it also manages to mention the unique points that different reviewers land on.  This bit is particularly compelling:   The writer Joan Smith, in a column for the Guardian, claimed Gone Girl is guilty of “playing on what we now know about the behaviour of abused women and undermining the credibility of victims”. She references a report by the Crown Prosecution Service last year, which found that, during a 17-month period, there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape and just 35 for making a false allegation of rape.  Smith’s argument wouldn’t carry as much weight were this film set against a vastly wider range of women’s stories, and characters in mainstream culture. One recent study by the Centre for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University found that of the 100 top-grossing films last year, female characters accounted for just 15% of the protagonists.   The problem is, is that in the current environment, the story can't just be read as a terrible person doing terrible things and screwing over a slightly less terrible person. This is true no matter how agendered the story is and the characters are. For example, let's take straight up revenge murder. A woman killing her ex-lover is a psycho bitch. If she's feminine and wants sex, she's a jealous slut/whore. If she's feminine and doesn't, she's an ice queen. If she's not feminine or pretty enough, she's a butch/dyke/cow. A man killing his ex-lover is still just a man, often a powerful and respected one. He may be portrayed as psychotic, but he may also be portrayed as ""taking care of business"", the kind of man you don't cross, someone who deserves respect. The same choices and traits that are read as emotional and unreliable in her, may not only earn him respect, but be seen as unemotional and reliable! When you look at the victims, she will often be seen as to blame for her own murder, he will almost never be. If he's blamed for anything, he'll be blamed for hooking up with such an obvious psycho/bitch/cunt. She is blamed for cheating on him, he is blamed for choosing her. The woman is always the source of trouble.   So it's not easy to write a story about a woman period, because you have to actively work against the audience's desire to pigeonhole everything she is and does as something caused by her femaleness. When you add in the gendered nature of the revenge in this story, and the shallowness of the on-screen version to the lack of female characters, and the way male=default, you're left with Female doing terrible Female things (because she's Female yo) to screw over a Man. She is a spectre, the personification of bad female qualities, and only he remains as an actual person."

I felt like the big cathartic point of the movie (or, rather, he pointsthat was supposed to be cathartic, but just made me mad and creeped out) was when you, as the viewer, realize that Amy is still alive and trying to screw over Nick. Not because she's alive, but because the movie has been setting you up to hate her, and you're finally allowed to hate her, because you're given a good reason. And that reason, as you said, is basically: all of your worst MRA nightmares about women are TRUE! So you're perfectly within your rights to keep hating women!   Ugh."

And that in turn leads to a narrative that can be read as ""here's a 'feminist' that's a sociopath, and she's framing men for murder! Feminists get frustrated with the world and frame innocent men!"" Amy has several crazy rants in the book that lean towards this pseudo-feminist frame.   What makes it more harmful in my opinion is that many people don't understand feminism, so to have a character riffing on pseudo feminist beliefs is just giving people an excuse to discount it.

Female characters don't benefit from having the same ""default"" status that men do, therefore there should be a counterweight female character to balance it out and provide a spectrum. That's not to say that there needs to be a Glenda Good Witch for every Wicked Witch of the West, just that there needs to be sufficient representation of characters belonging to the same minority background. It's enough to have a purely evil woman and a conflicted, complex woman who doesn't always do the right thing, as long as there is range between both."

It's not because of her boyfriend either, she said she just really hates pee. It's unfortunate that this issue will lead to people not being able to enjoy their sexuality, either because of a rude partner, or personal worries."

Hell, we've actually LOL'd during sex because of a queef.   And I constantly worry about her during and after. (""Did I go too deep again, did I punch her cervix again, oh fuck did she feel good, did I do enough foreplay, etc."") And she's never had a vaginal O, it just ain't happening for her, but she enjoys sex."

I think it's so odd that we are utterly disgusted by things that come from our own bodies. I was thinking about hair and how people seem to love and adore it and then the moment they find a strand on themselves or their chair or their clothing it's, ""oh ewww!"" Pee, obviously, isn't well loved or anything while it's in the body, but it's so odd that doing something our body naturally does is dirty and gross. And then it's sad when this sentiment impacts our enjoyment of other parts of life, like that woman."
FemmeThoughts,2sv4f2,UrbanRenegade19,8,Mon Jan 19 18:30:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about this. There are definitely major problems with people treating women like they don't know their own sexual experiences. I think that's probably what's to blame for people's gleefulness in saying hey it's really pee!, but not really what's to blame for the belief. I think the popular conception that female ejaculation is urine is the result of the early studies suggesting that. It's not obvious to me that the early researchers were any less credulous of women's self-reports than of other patients' self-reports about their bodies. (Not investigating when women are reporting discharging an amount of liquid doesn't seem to be coming from a known reservoir would be worse.) People are confused about what their bodies are doing all the time.  People with cracked ribs sometimes think they're having heart attacks. I had chronic pain for at least year that I was convinced was in my vagina when it was actually my bladder. Apparently that's not particularly uncommon.  It is of course hugely fucked up for people to try to shame women by saying it's really urine, but I don't think the hubbub is totally based on distrust of women's reports of their sexual experience."

FemmeThoughts,2sv4f2,AppleSpicer,2,Mon Jan 19 03:13:55 2015 UTC,"Dude here, and I have a couple questions from the article. It said that though the fluid came from the bladder, but it isn't urine. So what is it? I've heard that female ejaculation acts as some sort of natural lubricant, but I don't know if its true or not. Also does ejaculation feel any different than having a regular orgasm?"
FemmeThoughts,2sv4f2,Shmaesh,31,Mon Jan 19 03:20:31 2015 UTC,"What I'm about to say comes from my limited understanding.  We know that women can ejaculate, even when they pee right before sex. A recent study has shown that the bladder will fill up throughout intercourse and this fluid is what gets released. We also know from that study that the fluid contains similar compounds as urine, and we don't detect any additional compounds except trace amounts of one I can't remember.  So what is it? It's similar to urine. Similar enough that some people think it's acceptable to just call it that. However, this isn't any urine that you could pee out on a given day. Because the bladder is filling and releasing so fast, it's mostly water. If a bottle of soda was 95% water and 5% soda, would you call it water, soda, or watered-down soda?   Men in the reddit post on r/science were having a nice circle-jerk over the study, basically implying that women who swore it was something other than piss were out of their minds, but if it doesn't look, smell, or taste like piss, is it piss?  As a dude, I'm personally not interested in getting pissed on, but I never mind getting squirted on, so it would be pretty hypocritical of me to turn around and say ""We found small amounts of urea in yo squirt! It's 100% pee you monsters!"" to women, because obviously it's different from pee."
FemmeThoughts,2sv4f2,AppleSpicer,6,Mon Jan 19 03:33:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's a lubricant, because you typically don't squirt without penetration (it's usually caused by G-spot stimulation), so it would be sort of like lubricating after the fact.  It comes from the bladder, but it has a different concentration than urine, it has much less or no ammonia. Personally, I consider it a watered-down form of urine.  It does feel different than a regular orgasm. It basically feels likes a lot of pressure, like you have to pee, then when it actually happens, it's like having an orgasm and getting relief from peeing at the same time."
FemmeThoughts,2sv4f2,Shmaesh,7,Mon Jan 19 03:37:56 2015 UTC,"At least non-ejaculation fluids are blood plasma I've heard, so its probably similar. And when it happens it just feels like a super strong orgasm. I have to be told if it was a regular one or not, I can't tell!"
FemmeThoughts,2sv4f2,packyouup,5,Mon Jan 19 03:52:54 2015 UTC,"For whatever it means, I had an episode of female ejaculation at the gym. It was creamy and sweet smelling, roughly two tablespoons worth after feeling euphoria from an endorphin rush."

FemmeThoughts,2ssqo4,NoSonriasAqui,26,Sun Jan 18 03:23:21 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's not unwarranted to be as angry as you are. I cannot imagine being in your position, dealing with what you've had to deal with. But this anger, is it helping you? Is it what you ""should"" be feeling or what you ""could"" be feeling?   I wonder if, in wishing you were not so angry, you are like someone trying to teleport themselves across a room, an act which is physically impossible. Maybe it would be more helpful to focus on the little steps you must take to get there. I don't know what those are, because they'll certainly look different for you than they have for me. But one step for me has been the recognition that I have a choice in what I feel. (Of course, I have to remind myself of this again and again.) I recognize I've been choosing to feel X, and instead I'm going to work toward choosing to feel Y. Already there is the birth of peace there, because I am honoring my own agency.  I feel humbled saying this to you because, as I said, I cannot comprehend what you've been through."
FemmeThoughts,2ssqo4,thesecondkira,14,Sun Jan 18 04:39:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your thoughts. I do yoga on the regular, and did serious Kriya yoga (which is actually sitting-still-meditation) for a solid eight years. I've considered going back, but now I mostly do simple mala meditation.   Has any of that helped me? I don't know. It may be why I've managed not to murder anyone yet (not being pedantic, revenge fantasies are package deal with this kind of stuff).  As far as should, my brain has been programed that yes, I SHOULD be this angry, because if I'm not I won't have the strength to face my foes and will literally die. One of the issues is that, in the past, my brain has not been wrong. It's become a maladaptive coping mechanism that got wrapped up in the formation process of my person, because it started when I was so young. But you are right. I have to find some way to break that lock.   It certainly feels like trying to teleport across a room, or putting the ocean in a bag. I'm pretty fragmented form all the trauma, so different parts of me have split off to do different things. They don't communicate very well currently (though it's gotten better). Especially the conscious versus the subconscious or unconscious mind.  My subconscious basically thinks its the boss. It is a very, very scary thing to experience. Do I have the ability to choose what I feel? Sometimes yes, sometimes it's a big fucking no. I struggle with agency even among myself!   No one can comprehend this kind of thing. Its the incomprehension that breaks us, ultimately. Just...take a moment and be grateful for the good things in your life? Maybe at least I can bring that to others."
FemmeThoughts,2ssqo4,Shmaesh,14,Sun Jan 18 05:13:39 2015 UTC,"I want to tell you that none of my experiences are as painful or as crushing as some of yours. First.  But also, if you ever do find a way to stop relying on the anger -- It's rough.   It's cry for weeks and not want to leave the house rough. Off and on for maybe years. Probably worse for you than it was to me. That shit kept me moving, kept me going, kept me safe and kept me warm. For years. And when I started to let it go, I was left with an enormous emotional vacuum that I could probably never have adequately prepared for.   I suspect whatever you experience wil be greatly magnified. I wish you luck, and I wish you the empowerment to take the leap. It's devastating, but I've never really wanted to go back. Rage burns out your brain over time. Literally. It's absolutely worth being sad and scared and too vulnerable for a while in comparative safety over your brain cannibalizing itself slowly when you no longer need it to protect you the way it has been."
FemmeThoughts,2ssqo4,Shmaesh,10,Sun Jan 18 05:19:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've dipped my toe into this. The first six months of therapy were basically me flopping around in agony, hallucinating, suicidal ideation every 3 minutes, and randomly breaking into hysterical crying fits that would last for hours on two to three day intervals. It almost killed my graduate school work. It almost killed my relationship. It almost killed me.   I had to seriously back that shit up and take a break for a few months. Honestly, the only thing that saved my ass was an illicit low dose MDMA assisted therapy session when it was starting to look like I might need hospital. I started therapy again only recently.   When I ruminate on losing my anger, one of the aspects that comes up is that it scares me. It's been my driving force for 15 years. Who am I without it? Can I still be an achiever? Will I lose my edge, the thing that makes me awesome and competent and deadly? Will I become weaker?   And then my PTSD addled mind goes, Weaker!? NOPE. We can't have that. What is the one rule? Survive. Survive. Survive! You cannot do anything that takes away your survival edge. It becomes a vicious thought circle of arguing with myself.   And even after all that suffering that I just did. The lake of saved up tears that came out, all of it, the burning ball of anger persists like it wasn't even phased. It's very disheartening.   What did you fill the vacuum with?  And also, I'm sorry. I understand. You are very brave."
FemmeThoughts,2ssqo4,lovelybone93,3,Sun Jan 18 05:35:06 2015 UTC,"It's scary. It definitely should be.  If you're in a legitimately safe place in your life, with people who can go through it with you, it's worth the sufferig to let it go, though. You can still achieve, be competent, funny, brave and strong. You'll just be able to do it without hurting yourself and others, if you want. I don't know what to recommend for the fear, though. It is a process of reforming yourself, for sure.  I filled the vacuum with learning how to build costructive relationships, rewiring how I communicate with people I love, accepting that being sad doesnt' mean I'm weak or in danger. Lots of pathetic music for several years and just accepting that I'm going to cry a lot for a while. Maybe forever.   That was seven years ago, give or take, and I still cry at the drop of a hat. But I've done great things in my interpersonal relationships, people trust me more now, I'm not weaker like I worried. I really, really hope you're able to take the leap when you're ready. At the speed and pace that's best for you. And I wish I knew how to help you do it better."
FemmeThoughts,2ssqo4,lovelybone93,9,Sun Jan 18 14:16:55 2015 UTC,"No, it's completely normal to be a boiling cauldron of rage and anger due to PTSD.   You absolutely need therapy to help with PTSD, I go to therapy for mine, (our genders are reversed and so were our perpetrators, mine was my mother trying to kill me). It's great to hear that you're not turning to booze or drugs like others with our condition do.   As someone who suffers PTSD as well, you cannot wish your anger, your hatred away, you must embrace it, your abusers control your life otherwise.  When you see yourself in that flashback as a little girl, take her, hug her, soothe her, let her know it's not her or your faults, that they can't hurt you anymore.   I used to not trust women, but women IRL and on reddit have shown me not all women are bad, not all women are trying to kill me or be nasty to me.   Killing your emotions isn't the solution, there is a breaking point, as I've tried that, to no avail.   Living within yourself and blocking everyone else out is no way to live, but that's how your mind reacts to this in order for self-preservation, nobody/nothing is allowed in, only hatred and rage.  As for the minimization, objectification, devaluation of women, you are correct, it is systemic, cultural, ingrained into society due to the patriarchy.   We need it and ""gender norms"" gone, just people being free to be people.  I don't know how else to help you, except for showing you /r/ptsd, and saying I'm sorry.   As a man, I apologize for being your trigger, apologize for being an ass, apologize for the suffering my gender has caused you, but I know it cannot be enough."
FemmeThoughts,2ssqo4,AppleSpicer,3,Sun Jan 18 06:47:31 2015 UTC,"Somehow a bunch of people with PTSD hanging out together seems like a bad idea? I don't say that to be crass, but we're all bombs. What happens if one of us goes off? I can see that having a devastating cascading affect. And reinforced toxicity loops. I can see that too.   Of course that could just be me being negative and hissy, but I guess I'm kind of proving my own point.   I tried group therapy once. Once. NEVER AGAIN. I felt like a venomous space lizard locked in a pen with a bunch of fat bleating sheep. I was constantly wondering when I was going to suddenly snap and eat one of them, and I'm certain I telegraphed that strongly. Not good for them, not good for me. So maybe I'm just not fit for groups.   I've been embracing my anger for a long time. I used to take pride in it, revel and bathe in it. It's what I had inside my veins instead of blood. It was the knife hidden behind my back that allowed me to wear my mask and stride around like a war general. But yeah, I'm almost 30 and I'm done with that. I'm tired of being really deep inside myself with only my rage for company. I want more from life than that. And I'm trying. It's just so ardent, this red streak in me."
FemmeThoughts,2ssqo4,AppleSpicer,3,Sun Jan 18 07:35:11 2015 UTC,"They can be very supportive over at r/ptsd, I have had a good experience with the sub. As for therapy, you can choose what's best for you, as you and your therapist know better than I.  As for snapping, I used to do that and quite violently when I was bullied or approached the wrong way, but have learned to channel my rage into less destructive activities.  Reveling and bathing in your anger, your rage isn't the way. When I mean embrace your hatred, your anger, I mean to acknowledge the existence of it, the cause of it and figure how to rid yourself of it in a constructive way, like reading, walking/running, video games, whatever takes your mind off it.  It will take a long time for you to get over things, possibly the entirety of your life to get over the rage. Our spectres will haunt us to the end of our days, we have to ignore them.  I'm quite a bit younger than you at 21, going on 22, so you can dismiss this as me talking out of my ass if you wish, but I hope peace comes to you."

FemmeThoughts,2ssqo4,MVenture,5,Tue Jan 20 06:21:17 2015 UTC,"For me, it's primal. When I'm that fed up and all of the coping mechanisms fail, I find somewhere safe and embrace it. The best one so far that I've found is driving to the ocean at night and standing knee deep in the waves. I don't think about whatever bothered me, I just breathe and feel powerful. I'm a fantastic swimmer and the salt air is healing, the water is one of the most powerful things on earth. I let my emotions free, and I feel like a damn goddess. Like I am the only thing that matters, I am free and able to handle anything that comes my way. I indulge every murderous fantasy and let my mind go. It anchors me. When it's run out, I'm calm, and I drive home with the music off for once.  I don't know what might work for you. But maybe start there. Give your emotions time to breathe. Find somewhere you feel powerful. Own it.  Good luck. You'll always be strong. As someone who has let go of her strength- I'm stronger now. That extra room will just add more ferocity, and happiness. We're rooting for you."

FemmeThoughts,2srt01,lovelybone93,9,Sun Jan 18 00:30:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the risk is very low with modern tampons. Basically what used to happen was that super-absorbent tampons came along in around the '80s(???), and women left them in for their entire periods, which led to TSS."

FemmeThoughts,2srt01,lovelybone93,6,Sun Jan 18 00:25:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, changing them regularly is effective in avoiding TSS (the internet is full of horror stories about women who accidentally have left tampons in for amazing lengths of time with no TSS, though. It's not a guarantee in any situation).  3-4x a day makes my vag cringe so hard. Your girlfriend is amazing. That's normal, but probably more frequent than many women, since drying out your bits with constant absorption can be really, really uncomfortable (why I went over to the cup). I think I used to do 2-3x a day, which was still very uncomfortable for me by the end of my cycle.  When homeless, I guess the goal would be to find a private place or bathroom to make the switch. Hermit's point above is salient. A tampon can be and very often is more self-contained than the cup, making privacy in public situations easier."

All of the cups on the market are more capacity than any tampon, and there are somewhere upwards of ten available to U.S. buyers. Not every cup fits every woman, and some women do not find cups a good fit. But if she's never tried, it's not too expensive to give it a go. I started with the Diva because of brand recognition, but after a year plus of it not quite doing the trick the way I want, I'm considering trying a different brand. Probably a Moon cup. Spread out, the financial impact is so much lower, it's worth it to toy around with different ones over time and get the perfect fit, if possible.  Totally not my place, but they're out there, they're great for some of us, and many menstruators feel much less discomfort with them than tampons. And there's no obligation to do it forever if you give it a go and it's not a good solution.  ETA: If you want me to talk at you on this topic further, shoot me a PM and I'll be happy to."
FemmeThoughts,2srt01,Shmaesh,4,Sun Jan 18 12:07:59 2015 UTC,"Jumping on this. The Meluna brand has some of the most varied sizes and three types of firmness avaliable, There should be a cup that comes close to your perfect size with that brand. I got mine for $20 and it's medical grade silicone and one of the few brands that claims to last a life time.  My cervix is titled and oval shaped, but the meluna shorty fits me well, It holds 20ml which isn't much but if you are filling it more than twice a day then you should see a doctor because anything over 100ml per cycle is technically menorrhagia and it may be treatable. I had mine when I was homeless, but I was lucky enough to have access to public bathrooms that provided me a hygienic place to empty it.  I was homeless but not broke, so I would buy denture tablets to clean my cup between cycles. Fill an old jam jar with water, drop in the tablet, drop in the cup, screw on the lid and chuck it back in my bag and then remember to empty it out and put the cup back in its bag in a few hours.  Now that I have better conditions, I use sponge tampons. they are far more comfortable than regular tampons and the cup. They are foolproof to insert, better for vaginal health than regular tampons and they are reusable. You can cut them to a size that suits you, the bigger they are the more they hold. My largest one is about the size of a gob-stopper and holds as much as my cup. You soak them in vinegar or boil them to clean them between cycles."

And he blames the feminist conspiracy for getting people to consider it rape, and consider it worth punishing.  EDIT: Look at that quote in full:   The solution is common sense. Women are going to be sexually assaulted. And, men are going to be falsely accused of sexual assault. We have allowed our entire society to be so sexually open that these young people are bombarded constantly via TV, movies, magazines, internet, etc. with SEX every hour of every day. The feminist activist groups take the position that the answer to this problem is to lock up every male accused of sexual assault. They react this way...   He doesn't view ye olden times as not talking about things. He views ye olden times as a magical place where rape didn't happen, because women were chaste and didn't pervert society.  He also has this ridiculously gross and nonsensical paragraph:   Few would argue that if a female is fully conscious, kissing and making sexual advances to a male, that this does not constitute ""consent"". Now, consent to what? Only the female knows this. Once actions that clearly constitute some form of sexual activity exist, the female needs to say ""no"" to set the lines of behavior for it not to go further. So, the male knows either by a verbal ""yes"" or by her clear actions that he has a green light. That green light exists until she puts out the red light, which she can do at anytime with either a verbal ""no"" or any reasonable form of resistance."

If a female does not sex, then she will stop trying to attract the male, and so he won't be attracted to her. Logic!   /s  Seriously though, that's basically just a step away from what he said. He's saying that if a female indicates her interest (doesn't have to be spoken, so a guy thinking she's flirting would do), then the male has permission for anything until she says stop.   Which ew, is fucking gross, and in many instances, rape. Women aren't hiding what consent is from men for the funsies....in his world, you don't talk about what you are and are not comfortable with. The male takes what he wants until the female stops him. Gross.  Also, his using ""male"" and ""female"" instead of ""man"" and ""woman"" makes it all a million times creepier."

In an unequal world, satire that mocks everyone equally ends up serving the powerful. And in the context of brutal inequality, it is worth at least asking what preexisting injuries we are adding our insults to.  The belief that satire is a courageous art beholden to no one is intoxicating. But satire might be better served by an honest reckoning of whose voices we hear and don't hear, of who we mock and who we don't, and why.   I've had a number of people posting about Charlie Hedbo on facebook, with one lone voice who's been dissenting racism in the name of free speech, and I was having a difficult time deciding where on the spectrum I was at. The cartoons made me uncomfortable, I didn't like saying ""oh free speech, it's alright then"" - but I didn't know enough background on any of it to know if I was missing something either. This article really helped to clarify my thoughts."
FemmeThoughts,2si70v,tandem7,10,Thu Jan 15 16:26:21 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have felt like this, and even Glen Greenwald wrote a piece about the outright racism of the Charlie Hebdo publication. We shouldn't kid ourselves, we are defending a racist publication guilty of: “Encoding racism to make it imperceptible, and therefore socially acceptable”. A racist ideology hidden behind a humanist mask, which is how Thomas Deltombe describes the function of Islamophobia, a method that uses criticism of Islam to openly criticise Arabs, thus effectively making Charlie Hebdo and other publications like it, a “machine for refining crude racism” into socially palatable satire.  What's the difference? Well a satirical, political cartoon might have Obama drawn with exaggerated proportions and with a long, straight nose as Pinocchio. A racist cartoon would draw him as an ape. Or a Japanese man with buck teeth and glasses. Or a jew with a hooked nose.  Hate speech, however, is free speech. And if that's the case then yes, we have to defend it. Personally I would rather have consistent Hate Speech laws or just completely unbridled Free Speech, because currently what we have in the Western world, with some things being okay but others not, like the anti-semitic comedian who was jailed in France just days ago, is walking a weird line between the two that makes the system more oppressive  and inconsistent as it allows laws to be unequally and arbitrarily enforced.  It begs the question, is hate speech free speech then, or isn't it? Make up your damn minds."
FemmeThoughts,2si70v,Adahn5,6,Thu Jan 15 17:35:16 2015 UTC,"Well, in Canada, hate speech is not necessarily free speech. There are certain allowances for political opinion (such as the cartoons at Charlie Hedbo, for instance) but you can end up in legal trouble over hate speech (although I think we call it hate propaganda here)."
FemmeThoughts,2si70v,tandem7,3,Thu Jan 15 21:33:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And there are, for instance, countries in Europe that have made organisations such as the Nazi Party illegal. Personally I'm all for putting a big fat ball gag in the mouth of Neo-Nazis, which is why I'm always astounded to see them have their marches and their declarations of killing Jews, Africans, etc, all be protected in the US under freedom of speech."
FemmeThoughts,2si70v,Adahn5,4,Thu Jan 15 21:58:52 2015 UTC,"Well, there's also a difference between hate speech and dangerous hate speech. There are lots of idiots foaming off at the mouth, but the damage they cause is minimal if any. But organised hate groups, those are like a fucking cancer.  The problem is, it's hard to come up with good, consistent hate speech laws. Germany has made the Nazi party illegal, but there's a pretty big neonazi movement there. They just avoid using the specific things that are outlawed.  Has any country managed to make laws against hate speech that are consistent and fair and work properly? If you've got a model of a country that's done this well, I'd love to know.  And also, frankly, at least in terms of the US, I'd be very hesitant to allow such laws. Because I have a feeling that they'd target Black Power movements instead of White Power movements. Creating a law like this in such an unequal system might only serve to make things significantly worse.  The US govt has a long history of spying on and infiltrating civil rights movements. And heck, even today, we treat communists terribly. You still can't become a citizen if you're a communist.   I'm finding it hard to imagine that a law against hate speech would target the Neo Nazis and RaHoWa. I imagine it would instead be used to target the civil rights movement, and occupy and anonymous and so on.   EDIT: To add on to this point, there have been several recent arrests in France, including of a comedian for ""condoning terrorism"". Th problem with laws that censor hate speech, is that the people in power get to decide what is hateful."

They aren't objects to be discarded at a whim when sex isn't involved and women's sexuality should be celebrated, not castigated. They shouldn't feel ashamed to have a lover or explore their own bodies, or ashamed of their bodily functions.  Women ARE equal to men and need to be treated as such."

A young woman comes into focus; she's holding a tray of food samples. She waves at the man and smiles at him.  We hear his mental monologue. Did she just make full eye contact?  Definitely no one behind me, he thinks, looking to either side.  As he approaches the woman, she asks him: ""Want a free sample?""  He reaches forward and takes one of the samples. The camera then cuts to the girl tossing her hair back with her free hand.  The title of the piece appears on screen. BuzzFeed presents: Is she flirting? Or just being nice?  ""Do you like to cook?"" The young woman asks.  ""Oh yeah, I love it,"" the young man says.  ""They go great on pies, or on salads,"" she says, her tone friendly and continuously smiling. ""And they're gluten free.""  ""Didn't know that..."" He says.  Sounds like she's taking an interest in my personal life, we hear him think.  ""Well, do you live with anyone? Should you buy for two?"" The young woman asks.  ""Oh, I uh,"" the young man stammers.  Is she trying to figure out if I'm single... She could just be trying to sell me apples, we hear him think.  ""You know, has anyone ever told you you look like another person?"" She asks.  He nods, and thinks: I do look like a relatable Matt Damon.  ""Normally I can only give people one free sample,"" she says. ""But you can have as many as you want.""  Does that mean what I think it means? He thinks to himself.  ""There is a great bar just around the corner,"" she says enthusiastically, ""that I go to all the time. You should totally check it out.""  ""Oh, okay. Uh, when?"" He asks.  ""Whenever!"" She says.  Alright. I'm in, that's a clear invitation. The young man thinks. Definitely gonna ask her out... Next week.  ""Good to meet you, Patrick,"" the young woman says.  ""Bye,"" he says, and leaves the line.  Subsequently, another man approaches the woman. He fidgets on arrival, and she slaps him on the arm.  ""Peter!"" She says to this new arrival, ""You came back! So good to see you! Have as many free samples as you want. Did you go check out that bar?""  The video ends and credits roll.

He is able to be empathetic and critical at the same time in a way that is very realistic to the situation at hand. Because a lot of these dudes have turned their pain to anger, and while it's not an excuse, it's something they have to be told is OK to feel before they can accept and heal.  Also, holy shit: ""None of the pain Scott talks about came from things that happened to him. They came from things that happened inside his head."" Well fucking said."
FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,lockedge,16,Sun Jan 11 15:48:43 2015 UTC,"I tried to say more-or-less this when Scott's initial comment and the first round of reactions came out, but couldn't find the right words.   What’s the biggest difference between Scott’s and Amy’s stories? Scott’s story is about things that happened inside his brain. Amy’s story is about actual things that were done to her by other people against her will, without her control.   That's basically it, I think.  Doesn't mean what happened to him wasn't serious and unpleasant, or that it wasn't ""real"".  I mean, the man apparently was convinced for years that if anyone found out he experienced sexual attraction or desire he might be expelled or thrown in jail.  That's pretty heavy shit to deal with!  But in the end, it was something he was doing to himself."
FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,pimpmyrind,6,Sun Jan 11 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"Aye. Growing up, a saw a lot of my friends fall onto Scott's sort of mindset. It was troubling, and worrying, but they were my friends, so I stuck with them (and to my knowledge, all grew out of it long ago through solid support systems).  One of my friends was convinced that if he asked a girl out, the reaction would be like the armies of hell  charging down a hill and running him through for having the gall to do so, and that even looking at another girl would render him a creep or a pervert in the eyes of the girls at our high school. He was depressed, for sure...and that certainly had a lot to do with it, alongside him being entrenched in nerd culture (favourite hobbies: everquest, drawing anime, reading manga, watching anime, playing videogames of all kinds).  And eventually, one time when he seemed to be in a period of being less depressed than usual, a friend and I prodded him to ask this one girl out who he shared art class with. He was convinced it would end in a bloody demise, but with enough bribes and pushing, he did. He was rejected (she was dating a guy at the other high school in town), but she thought he'd be great for her friend, who my friend also shared art class with. The next day, the two were dating, and he honestly couldn't believe it. He thought it was hopeless...he was one of the few of my friends who had considered nerdy girls who shared similar interests (a lot of my other friends lusted after the more popular girls at the time), and was utterly fascinated that someone could be interested in him. Fast forward a year later, he's as much of a nerd as ever, and the two had broken up, but he was a lot more confident in himself and only rarely dealing with bouts of depression.   Basically all of my white, nerdy friends went through the same phenomenon of asking a girl out and her mildly rejecting or accepting them, instead of the pits of hell opening up underneath them.  Nerd culture's undertones of self-deprication, covered by an air of superiorrty, IMO probably only help intensify the lack of self-esteem in talking to/communicating with people they're attracted to, and likely makes them feel worse about their own level of attractiveness in relation to non-nerds, which is sad. But that might just be expected from a culture borne out of social isolation...cultural traits tend to have momentum.  So people who feel that way, their experiences and feelings may be real, but they certainly may not be based on reality. Some, sure, but not all. Like you said, it can lead to dealing with a lot of heavy shit unnecessarily."
FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,codayus,2,Mon Jan 12 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"But in the end, it was something he was doing to himself.   Most people's problems are things they inflict upon themselves, because they grow up in a miasma of cultural expectation that they're trying to conform to.  Let's not lose site of the fact that that cultural expectation is the primary problem, and not the secondary effects.  One of the responses I read to the original discussion was along the lines of ""Feminisim didn't do this to him, patriarchy did.""  Spot on IMO."

I think you're missing the point of the article, which is that there was no cultural expectation of the things he claimed to believe.  It's not that he misidentified who was telling him that normal sexual attraction would get him expelled or even imprisoned (his words), its that literally no external force was telling him this.  It was no more the patriarchy than it was feminism, or little green men."
FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,vagued,35,Sat Jan 17 21:39:45 2015 UTC,"As a white male nerd I still can't really relate to hating feminists/feminism.  I mean feminists aren't more likely to turn me down when I ask them out (although I've never done a survey hahah).  I get how he feels to some degree, its certainly frustrating to hear that everything you like is perceived as ""uncool"" and I have had girls make fun of me for my interests before, but I hardly see what that has to do with feminists.  I think when you feel like you aren't getting what you want, its hard to hear that you are ""privileged.""  Especially when it seems like everyone around you has what you want, and you feel like you deserve what they have more than they do.  That bitter resentment hardly attracts anyone to your presence, which furthers the feeling of isolation.    To then hear that you are better off then everyone else is hard to believe, its incredibly disjointed from the reality of depression you feel/experience everyday.  This isn't something that I have personally felt, but I can see where it comes from.  I think its helpful to remember that we all have problems, and since everything is relative to our own experiences, its hard for people to accept that other's might have it worse then themselves.  But I'm not always sure that, especially on Reddit, that these men, right or wrong, are approached in a constructive manner.    These ideas that they have are intrinsically linked to their feelings, and while their ideas are often wrong(even worse than wrong in many cases), we can't exactly say the same thing about their feelings.  So while I see many people addressing the inaccuracies of their ideas (often passionately attacking them) I rarely see the submerged feelings addressed, and its a problem compounded by society's encouragement of emotional suppression of the male gender, as their emotions are often hidden behind a facade.   Its a good article, thanks for posting it."
FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,chinese_drugs,20,Sun Jan 11 01:33:47 2015 UTC,"I think there's some truth to this.  It's not that people are saying their feelings are wrong, I think the disagreement is with their apparent assumption that everyone should care about their feelings, or that their feelings are evidence that they've been wronged.  They talk about being made to feel bad as if it's a shocking atrocity, but it's not; sometimes they just have to feel bad, and eat it, and move on with their lives, and if they can do that without letting it turn them into bitter misanthropes, they might be able to approach a better understanding of how to avoid getting hurt repeatedly in the same way."
FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,DOTAVICE,36,Sun Jan 11 02:52:01 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but I disagree. The role of women and feminists is not to cater to these men's feelings in order to get them to understand. Women constantly have to adjusts their actions to accommodate men, and the point of feminism is to give women autonomy within a system that tries to deny them of it. If these guys don't get feminism because it's so hard for them to get beyond their own issues, the onus to overcome that is on them, not on feminists. It's not our job to explain things to men.   I'll use a race analogy to further explain my point. I come from a low-income white family. Compared to a lot of white people, I was at a disadvantage from the beginning. This has left me with feelings of inadequacy and constant fears of going broke. It wasn't ever easy for me to afford college or get a decent job. That said, I am able to put my experience aside and see that minorities from a similar economic background to me have a greater struggle than I do due to prejudices ingrained into society. No one held my hand and explained that to me. It's something that I can see just by opening my eyes and putting myself into the shoes of other people. My own struggle doesn't diminish theirs.  If I can see my white privilege as a relatively disadvantaged white person, then these nerdy, self-loathing guys can do the same for women."
FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,chinese_drugs,11,Sun Jan 11 06:48:58 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that it is no one's responsibility but their own to over come their prejudices.  My point as that debating them over their incorrect ideas is counter productive.  It makes us angry and them more enraged.  Another person telling them that they don't get it or that they are wrong isn't going to sway their mind, and i personally think there are more constructive ways to deal with them.    I know that many here on on this sub have simply given up on trying to reason with them, and for good reason, their hatred is pretty toxic.  But if you do choose to engage with them, as with everyone you decide to talk to, its important to understand the underlying thought processds., and to stress those rather than the symptoms."

FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,DOTAVICE,50,Sun Jan 11 11:14:49 2015 UTC,"One thing I think worth considering is the way so-called ""rational thinking"" is fetishized in nerd communities, too. Especially in geek communities focused on programming, science, gaming, etc you see a lot of people talking about fact and ""thinking rationally"" and basically imagining themselves as hyper-rational robots--augmented by the stereotype that women are crazy emotional creatures while men are cool-headed rational beings. So you combine this stereotype with the encouragement to suppress one's feelings and you get a whole bunch of dudes who cannot acknowledge their rage is borne of emotions, they feel their rage is born of facts and inarguable injustices and everyone just doesn't care about the unfairness (see: GamerGate).  There can be no empathy for anyone else, because everyone else is just illogical and crazy, while they are the ultimate arbiter of what is right and wrong because they've got the logic and facts.  Of course, all modern scientific research demonstrates our decisions--including our ethical ones--are driven almost entirely by emotions, and people who claim rationality are even more likely to be driven by emotion than those who readily admit where their emotions influence them.  But that's the sort of thing these would-be robots like to ignore."
FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,kitcat_kittycat,10,Sun Jan 11 07:51:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's certainly an issue.  I have heard many men claim that women are more irrational than men.  My question for them is always ""is following your heart really irrational?""  As men we are often told to keep our emotions to ourselves, but I hardly can imagine why that's more rational than simply admitting that we are emotional beings."
FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,DOTAVICE,25,Sun Jan 11 09:25:33 2015 UTC,"More than that, I think the point is even when we think we're being rational and emotionless we're fooling ourselves. Time after time psychologists and behavioral scientists demonstrate it is impossible to separate the two.  Paradoxically, the people who say ""Yes, I see how my emotions are influencing my decisions"" end up making more rational decisions because they're more in-tune with how their emotions intertwine with their decision-making process.  In fact, I've read emotions play a crucial role in the decision-making process.  People who have damage to the ""emotion centers"" of the brain are able to weigh the pros and cons of a decision but find their decision-making ability impaired because they end up having difficulty actually choosing a side.  EDIT: another great example of this is the entire field of behavioral economics wherein we've discovered that humans are actually terrible at being rational actors and the decision to structure our economy and economic theories around that assumption is like, the worst ever"

I have this problem with decisions I couldn't care less about. I can analyze the pros and cons of bother positions, but if I don't have an emotional commitment to one or the other, I find it almost impossible to decide. Especially since there are no purely ""right"" decisions without any possibility of something undesirable happening, making purely rational decision-making impossible."
FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,DOTAVICE,2,Sun Jan 11 20:49:07 2015 UTC,"My question for them is always ""is following your heart really irrational?""   By definition - yes, it is.

FemmeThoughts,2rzt5r,V2Blast,3,Tue Jan 13 07:57:57 2015 UTC,"You can make a rational decision to follow your heart, that's my point, and making a conscious decision to not do so doesn't always constitute rationality, especially when it comes at a cost.

This is not the place to flaunt your good guy cred, and explain how you aren't like this. This line of argument is derailing, and one we don't have much tolerance for here.

Needless to say I have very little patience for white nerd entitlement and the issues that lead them to hate feminism and women in turn. I was and to some extent still am as much of a nerd I was, and I had the same issues. It never manifested, however, as hatred toward women. Maybe it's because my mother raised me better and taught me early on about second wave feminism, maybe it's because of my father who, by raising me to be a Socialist I knew that women held up the other half of the sky, and that feminism was intrinsic for Socialism and Communism to succeed.  What these male, often white, cisgender nerds need to get through their heads is that their hatred should be aimed at the Patriarchy, which is the true cause of their dismay, not feminism and certainly not women."

Calling genitals by their real name, etc.  When we act as if sexuality is taboo or dirty, it's an uncomfortable conversation.

I also think that the more you stand out, the more people feel comfortable commenting on your looks, or asking rude questions, or disbelieving you.  I'm fairly certain that some of the rude stuff I got when I was blond, the person would have thought when I was brunette. But a lot more people said it when I was blond.   When someone (especially a woman) sticks out, and is different, we feel much more comfortable commenting on them and objectifying them.

It's almost positively a combination of factors, and they're probably only aware of one or two at the most.  And yeah, a combination of obliviousness or thick skin and walking around like you mean business can do wonders. The more vulnerable you look, the more certain guys harass you.

Since its introduction into the academic literature, stereotype threat has become one of the most widely studied topics in the field of social psychology.  Stereotype threat has been shown to reduce the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups.  If negative stereotypes are present regarding a specific group, group members are likely to become anxious about their performance, which may hinder their ability to perform at their maximum level. For example, stereotype threat can lower the intellectual performance of African-Americans taking the SAT reasoning test used for college entrance in the United States, due to the stereotype that African-Americans are less intelligent than other groups.  Importantly, the individual does not need to subscribe to the stereotype for it to be activated. Moreover, the specific mechanism through which anxiety (induced by the activation of the stereotype) decreases performance is by depleting working memory (especially the phonological aspects of the working memory system).

FemmeThoughts,2rqp4g,deliaaaaaa,1 point,Tue Jan 13 21:46:58 2015 UTC,I would agree with this!
FemmeThoughts,2rqp4g,hermithome,1 point,Thu Jan 8 17:51:32 2015 UTC,Roseanne was the best show.
FemmeThoughts,2rqp4g,junjunjenn,9,Fri Jan 9 09:50:15 2015 UTC,"I think this article makes one really good point that's often overlooked - while yes, fuck, we need some bigger people on USA shows that aren't tired tropes, have personalities, and aren't just hypersexualised/lazy/greedy/whatever, we also need a range of body sizes.  Look at Glee; they're either very slim, or much bigger (maybe Glee is a bad example because they did try). Bridesmaids: either super slim, or ""she's the fat girl"". Never just... a bit plump."
FemmeThoughts,2rqp4g,Floofeh,14,Fri Jan 9 21:40:22 2015 UTC,Exactly. The average American woman is neither very big or tiny. They're right in the middle - the forgotten middle child. Which is horrible because women who have the truly average size deserve awesome representation in today's media.
FemmeThoughts,2rqp4g,prosthetic_ass_farts,3,Tue Jan 13 21:47:40 2015 UTC,"Bridesmaids had Kristen Wiig (super slim), Maya Rudolph (average build), Wendy Mclendon-Covey (a few pounds extra), and McCarthy (overweight). Then there was Rose Byrne who played Helen, who was the classic definition of thin and beautiful, who's basically picked on for being so."
FemmeThoughts,2rqp4g,hermithome,0,Fri Jan 9 01:06:20 2015 UTC,"Every woman in that movie except Melissa McCarthy is incredibly slim.  Maya Rudolph may look closer to an average build next to someone as naturally very skinny as Kristen Wiig, but I would be genuinely surprised if she's any bigger than a size 6.  I would like to see more women in the 12-14 size range who are taller than 5'2"".  I know that sounds very oddly specific but I'm just tired of short skinny, tall skinny, and short fat being the only people that exist on TV."
FemmeThoughts,2rqp4g,prosthetic_ass_farts,2,Fri Jan 9 01:14:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, those numbers. I mean, I knew Friends was bad, but I didn't realise just how bad. But holy mackerel, those are some seriously bad numbers. Uggh.  I just wish there was good comedy on TV. I don't watch any sitcoms because they are so gross and tropey, and it's sad, because I love comedy."
FemmeThoughts,2rqp4g,hermithome,4,Fri Jan 9 03:53:54 2015 UTC,Ummm.. I can't believe this article fails to mention one of the best shows on TV that also happens to have an overweight female lead! Drop Dead Diva!
FemmeThoughts,2rqp4g,junjunjenn,12,Fri Jan 9 21:39:30 2015 UTC,"In Drop Dead Diva her weight is a big focus of the plot and her character. It's not that she happens to be fat, it's that the role was written as ""fat people are humans too"" instead of her weight being a secondary or tertiary trait. Same goes for most homosexual characters and Asian characters on TV too. DDD is very lighthearted typical Lifetime original. Nothing wrong with that, but it would be wonderful if we could have an overweight character without it being a major plot point in a big serious tv show. :)"

It was great having the whole family come together to support my brother and his wife.   My mom made the cake my husband and I found a local florist who made a beautiful boquet for her on short notice and my dad bought my brother a suit. My grandma and mom lent her some heirloom jewlery for her something old and borrowed.   It was a perfect wedding with no drama and not a dry eye in the house while they were reciting their vows! Plus that same day I was hired to teach at my local community center and it was my birthday! Yesterday was awesome!
FemmeThoughts,2rpjg5,Adahn5,10,Thu Jan 8 04:17:32 2015 UTC,This is women wanting to be more like men so that they can be accepted as equals to men without doing the work of fighting for those rights to be both different AND equal.   Very well said
FemmeThoughts,2rpjg5,kochipoik,11,Thu Jan 8 08:26:27 2015 UTC,"See also: women going to strip clubs   Uh, feminist lesbians exist, you know. Liking to look at beautiful women naked does not make one a chauvinist pig."
FemmeThoughts,2rpjg5,ArsenicAndRoses,12,Thu Jan 8 15:50:56 2015 UTC,"I got stuck on that part, but the author does address it near the end of the article:  ""I'm not saying that there aren't women... that enjoy going to strip clubs and flashing their tits.  And there's nothing wrong with that! But doing it because you want to impress men and earn their respect is not helping you achieve your goals, and certainly isn't helping society as a whole."""
FemmeThoughts,2rpjg5,seven_ninety,6,Thu Jan 8 17:12:16 2015 UTC,"Good point. I still don't like the association though. It makes it seem like women only enjoy showing their body or looking at women's bodies to impress men. Or at least that's how I read it.   ...I dunno, maybe I'm just touchy from arguing with Dworkinbots."
FemmeThoughts,2rpjg5,ArsenicAndRoses,8,Thu Jan 8 17:21:37 2015 UTC,I don't think that's what the article intended. I believe that comment may have been referencing cisgender heterosexual snowflakes. But isn't that practice objectifying women? To go to a strip club and do so?  Just asking.
FemmeThoughts,2rpjg5,ArsenicAndRoses,5,Thu Jan 8 16:03:16 2015 UTC,But isn't that practice objectifying women? To go to a strip club and do so?    Not if you're being respectful/polite and treat them like people.
FemmeThoughts,2rpjg5,ArsenicAndRoses,5,Thu Jan 8 16:39:49 2015 UTC,But that's kind of the point of Levy's book it's normalised the self-objectification of women. Is it ever possible to be respectful/polite from afar if it's passively perpetuating that behaviour?
FemmeThoughts,2rpjg5,hermithome,8,Thu Jan 8 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"If appreciating a naked woman being sexy is passively perpetuating sexism, than all porn is passively perpetuating sexism. There is art and joy in the creation of sexyness- see: burlesque, ifeelmyself, etc. It's not mutually exclusive of feminism, and to say so is telling women that like being naked in front of an audience to be ashamed of who they are. That seems pretty antifeminist to me."
FemmeThoughts,2rpjg5,autowikibot,3,Thu Jan 8 17:01:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying so myself, just asking the question really. The second wave did create that duality of contradictions I think. Either embracing their nudity and sexiness is empowering, or its adherence to self-objectification. It's a line we now need to discuss as the legacy of that earlier feminism."

That seems pretty antifeminist to me.   Woah, that's a logical fallacy. To acknowledge the ways in which women being sexy contribute to objectification and the male gaze is NOT to say that women who enjoy being naked in front of an audience should be ashamed.  Contributing to the objectification of women and male gaze is not the point of women's sexuality and to insist that it is is to allow women's sexuality to be co-opted. BUT that doesn't mean that discussion of women's sexuality in terms of how it does or does not contribute to objectification of women is verboten.  Life is complicated. Something can both be feminist and also uphold male gaze as the dominant viewpoint. And pointing that out isn't a bad thing, and it isn't shaming women. Moreover, the article is explicitly about cis-straight-women who participate in misogyny in order to be accepted, or to be seen as an individual human. The article is not discussing the ways in which male gaze sometimes (accidentally) overlaps with queer female gaze."

You sound like just my kind of person, and I'm sure you're probably at least couple hundred of miles away from where I am, because that's how the world works.   For me, I live in a smaller-ish town in a region of the US that isn't very inclined to be of a like mind to me, so I'm just going to try and spread my net as wide as possible. The hope is, if I meet enough people, I'll find a few like me. Also I think once you find some people you like, you can get to know their friends and maybe speed up the process a little bit."

I definitely feel you on the first point! I really want to give back to my community as well.  For me, it's because the area I live in is often held up as an example of a ""bad"" or ""scary"" community, but I've always had really amazing, caring reactions with the people around me. I want to do everything I can to help these people live the lives they want to, and to get people outside to understand that villainizing the community is not the way to go.   The only reason I don't feel you on the dating point is because I'm looking for a nice queer lady to settle down with, which comes with maybe a different set of challenges than you face! Working in a male-dominated environment means I have at least a little window into the potential interactions you face and the frustrations thereof, though. I'm to the point where I don't understand how anyone finds anyone else similar enough to them for a commitment like marriage! It's magic, or something."

FemmeThoughts,2rcmqg,hermithome,4,Mon Jan 5 07:40:03 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of in this boat, but I'll at least share some of my experiences.  Send out feelers, and learn how to judge subtle cues. As I've gone through life, I've found that I can pretty quickly judge someone's general leanings/outlook on life just by the way they refer to certain issues. Ironically, it's actually usually the people who don't insert politics into their every conversation (those people are usually either trying to pick a fight or just assume everyone shares their exact opinions, which isn't very open-minded).   So anyway, I think there are two ways to go about this.   One is to go straight to the source - going to rallies and advocacy groups and shit will obviously yield people who are like-minded on those issues, and that helps with you #1 too, since a lot of those events are great for spreading awareness and generally participating in the process. Of course, this also depends on your area - I know in my area, people aren't very political and there aren't a ton of events, but in other places you might find lots of things to do. If you're feeling really adventurous, you could even start your own group - meetup.com and other places are good for that.   The other thing is just to go about your life doing unrelated (ish) activities and just connect with people and see if you're on the same-ish page. Sometimes it can take a while to find people, but it is possible. There are ways to subtly litmus test people for feminist leanings/general progressive-ness, too. You can go straight to asking about your ""deal breaker"" issues (I'm bi so biphobia is a no-go and I make that known VERY quickly with my friends), or you can kind of generally see. I sometimes find bringing up an article I've recently read here or in another more feminist forum is a good way of judging people's reactions. Like if you can share outrage at someone's gross privilege blindness, then that's a win!  Finally, depending on age and other factors, you can always ""convert"" people. I don't mean the aggressive religious kind, but I've had lots of friends (and my current SO) that were either politically apathetic or outright conservative, but when you actually sit down and talk with them about the issues, they aren't necessarily bound to those ideas. That's not to say it's all about convincing people to give up their beliefs, but I've found especially for younger people, we hold onto beliefs just because adults in our lives told us to, but when we really think about it, not all of those beliefs are really that important or something we really believe.   I think sometimes having genuine, compassionate conversations with people who are open to entertain other perspectives can be really rewarding, and you can find those people who don't strike you as feminist right away, but who really deep down hold those beliefs but just don't really register it yet."
FemmeThoughts,2rcmqg,hermithome,1 point,Mon Jan 5 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"good ideas, thank you.  How exactly do you put out feelers or judge subtle cues?  Hmm starting a meetup group - would it be weird if I just started a 'hippie feminist' group or something lol :p"
FemmeThoughts,2rcmqg,Adahn5,2,Mon Jan 5 04:36:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be too weird! If you wanted, you could try to start a group for a specific purpose, like a nature cleanup or rally or whatever, which might feel less awkward than inviting random strangers out to dinner or something like that. But I mean, obviously there are plenty of folks here feeling the same way, so it might just take someone making that first step.   For me, a big one is actually facebook. I'm kind of a social media junkie (trying to cut back, I promise!) and I pretty much stalk everyone's facebook feed. And I find, especially for certain issues, you can pretty quickly tell where someone stands. Like LGBT issues are pretty important amongst my social circles, and I can normally tell pretty quickly if someone's posting those heartwarming stories about coming out and the parents taking it super well, vs. posting ads for gay conversion therapy camps. Extreme examples, maybe, but I seriously have seen both from different circles, and needless to say I'm much closer to one group of friends than others.  Other ways can be casually inserting certain topics into conversation - like I will actually just do a ""grr, sometimes I hate the patriarchy"" type comment in conversation if something comes up that was super gender essentialist or whatever. The two reactions I've gotten are the person ignoring me/getting confused, or commiserating and being like ""yeah fuck the patriarchy!"" I don't know if I'm just the type of person to jump right into the issues but I seriously do feel like there are so many ways the conversation can be steered toward at least general worldview type beliefs.   It's tough, because you don't want to be judgmental due to first impressions, but you also have every right to be selective about the people you hang out with. But I think you can start seeing trends and notice the way certain people tend to react to certain issues."
FemmeThoughts,2rcmqg,Adahn5,1 point,Tue Jan 6 04:53:46 2015 UTC,"makes sense, thanks.  I like the idea of a facebook groyp - I wonder if that would be better than a meetup group, unless the meetup group was directly related to doing activism."
FemmeThoughts,2rcmqg,luinelen,2,Tue Jan 6 05:24:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are many ways about it, and it's definitely about feeling comfortable.

FemmeThoughts,2rcmqg,Ivegonewrong,3,Tue Jan 6 21:12:44 2015 UTC,"You need to look for stuff specific to your interests. There's a lot of community activism just about everywhere you go. And finding one group will generally lead to a lot of others. Ask your local parties for information on activism in the area - even if you don't politically align with them. For example, if you ask your local Democratic Party chapter and your local Socialist Party chapter, you'll likely get a range of local groups. Some will be things you're interested, some will not.   /r/Libs also maintains a large list of liberal organisations and publications. Many of these will have local chapters. Ask them.  If there's a particular organisation that you strongly identify with, or working on a cause you care about and they don't have a local chapter, reach out to the national organisation. Tell them where you're located, that you're passionate and looking to connect with people like you and make a difference. They might have some names and other advice.  There's also meetup.com, which has meetups for every possible thing you could imagine. Hobbies, sports, politics, arts, identity - take a look.   With regard to specifically looking for feminists, you have to be a bit more careful. There is still an issue with misogyny in a LOT of progressive circles. Make sure that the communities you connect with are feminist. Who's leading the community? Who's speaking up? What's the ratio of men to women? I'm a part of a few liberal and radical local communities, and feminism is important to all of them. It's a base thing, and it's considered a given. Same way that civil rights are, and trans and queer rights are. And you see that reflected in the body of people who show up. There are quite often more women then men. And it's a diverse group - pocs, queer people, trans people and so on.   And honestly, for me, it makes showing up really easy. I know that just about every single person I meet and work with is going to be an intersectional feminist. I know that they're going to see me as a person. I know that I'm going to get respect and be listened to. And that makes showing up and getting involved and making friendships really easy and really fun."
FemmeThoughts,2rcmqg,Ivegonewrong,2,Tue Jan 6 22:30:48 2015 UTC,"makes sense, thank you I will give it a try!  But why are there less men than women in progressive circles? that makes me sad  - in addition to meeting new friends who have like minded interest, and maybe doing activism or giving back to my community, i would love to meet a nice feminist guy..."
FemmeThoughts,2rcmqg,GoldieFox,2,Tue Jan 6 23:03:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't say there were. In fact, many progressive spaces are dominated by men, and not in a good way. Progressive spaces can still be pretty misogynistic, and still have all of the same issues with abuse that non-progressive spaces do.  In my personal experience, when I've sought out spaces that were progressive and actually feminist, I've found that they tend to be female dominated. I don't know if it's chicken or egg, but I know in my experiences that's common.  And I think of that as a good thing. I think that spaces that claim they are progressive but have a minority of women have issues. Spaces that claim they are progressive but don't have diverse representation have issues.  Women are slightly more than half the population, it really shouldn't be that surprising or groundbreaking to show up to places where they actually make up half the people in the room, or where they make up more than 50%.  I'm not saying that men don't show up. They do. But my current circles tend to lean towards female dominated. Not all of them by a lot. Some of them tend to be 55% women, or 60% women-which still means that there are a lot of men in the room. Some are more so than that. That doesn't really bother me. I don't need to be one of a handful of women in a room in order to find people to date.   If you're specifically looking for men to date, you might want to do explicitly that. Create an OKCupid profile, and make it obvious that you're a feminist, looking for a feminist guy. Choose mandatory questions that will highlight this and weed people out.   I'm not saying that you can't find feminist guys to date in progressive circles. You absolutely can. In fact, the age range of the people in the circles, and lifestyle range (how many are settled down, have kids) will probably have vastly more bearing on how many eligible guys you meet then the gender breakdown does. But if you're throwing yourself into feminist or progressive circles just to find guys to date, I sorta caution against that. The point, at least for me, was to fundamentally transform the people I considered a part of my social circle and community."
FemmeThoughts,2rcmqg,Shaysdays,2,Wed Jan 7 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"Hit and miss really. But generally it depends on the location. You'll find like-minded people in the places you yourself would frequent. Let's say you wanted to meet a guy that's into art. A museum that has a large paintings collection might be such a place. Or if you want to find a guy that's very progressive, or beyond that altogether and is say a Socialist or a Communist, check to see if there's a local Socialist Party or the equivalent where you live, and go to one of their meetings.  You may not necessarily get a Feminist (it's hit-and-miss with Socialists as of late when it comes to that) but you have a fairly better chance, because a majority of Socialists are indeed Feminists.  I digress. My point is simply that you play the likely demographics game. Say the majority of people who go to a particular band's concert tend to be x, y, and z. And you like x and z as qualities in a prospective partner. You go to said concert and check out the scene.  Otherwise you could try the online route, but there really isn't a viable, specific platform to find Feminist guys. I've found that (online anyway) most guys are 'Egalitarians', which is to say they're not Feminists, and don't really believe in equality between the sexes, just cop out their cisgender, hetero universalist spiel to cover their asses.  /u/The_Mermaid could tell you stories.

This provision offers website operators full immunity from liability stemming from content provided by a third party. Fact is, reddit is 100% safe from any consequences for their decision (TPTB are surely aware, and so have consciously decided) to allow their platform as an attractive venue for hate speech.

It's worth writing down those companies that advertise there.  Then taking a screenshot and sending them an email.  That's how some people got facebook to take harassment 'pages' seriously and that's really the only way to get reddit to listen.    Reddit has not yet made a real profit, and they're going to be feeling more and more pressure to do so over the next decade.  If advertisers start to find that their ads are juxtaposed with hate posts, pictures of dead people, CP, etc. then at least some of them are going to pull their ads without assurances that reddit ensures that their ads don't show up on hate pages.  Then reddit might consider identifying and monitoring hate subs, and perhaps even consider that having the rest of the site paying for hateful subs for which no one will allow their ads to appear is maybe not a good idea.  I don't know if it'd work, but I don't think it's a bad idea.  It's working with facebook, it's just a matter of finding a big company that's advertizing and catching their ads on a hate subreddit, and then hoping that the company ends up giving a damn."

FemmeThoughts,2r5iiw,electrostaticrain,8,Sat Jan 3 03:45:53 2015 UTC,"I'm using an anonymous account to discuss this, obviously, but this is the first time I'm admitting to people that I'm interested in child...stuff. I'm hoping people won't try to attack me, given the openness of this thread, & will read through to understand fully & respond appropriately. In all honesty. I don't think I am a pedophile. I have never touched children or have had any desire to outside the confines of my mind. I am a young woman, & have a complex history that may have led to these interests. I suppose, in posting this, I'm hoping for some people's thoughts and reactions. Opinions, really.   I don't think I'm a bad person. There is no chance I would ever touch or hurt a child. I've alway been a very caring person in nature, & I find children repulsive. That might not be fair. I find them annoying & awkward & frustrating. When with children, the thought of doing anything remotely sexual with them disgusts me.   My fantasies, however, are a different story. I get off on strong stuff due to my need for a large amount of mental excitation to be able to come. Stress spears my climax much more quickly, & my ability to come relies almost entirely on my mind, rather than on touch. I'm not actively sexually attracted to children. I would never want to actually have sex with a child and am extremely interested in & turned on by my fiancé, who I love immensely. However, when getting off with him, I rely on the ""strong stuff"" to get me to the peak of climax.   It's always been extremely hard for me to get off, so this may play a big role in this. Another, more important factor, however, is my history. I don't think I'm attracted to children, I think I'm attracted to the idea of myself being a weak, defenseless child. I never imagine myself as the adult hurting a child; I imagine myself as the child being hurt.  I went through some pretty shitty things in my childhood, including physical & mental abuse as well as strong sexual undertones at the hands of various people. My childhood doctor used to touch me in ways that I found inappropriate, whether I realized it or not at the time. I don't know if what he did was sexual abuse, but the important part is that I reacted as if it were - I expressed strong PTSD symptoms from the ages of 2/3-12 or so. I experienced nightmares for months leading up to those appointment, & loved getting shots because it was the one doctor's visit where I knew what would happen to me.   Getting older, I became involved in BDSM relationships, seeking out control-freaks, rapists, & abusers. In my mid-20's, after being raped in 4 different instances & by far more people, I finally broke free of this lifestyle & set about fixing myself, which I did.   The worst assault happened at the hands of a man 4x my age, but I'd had already developed an interest for what I'll call ""young porn"" (I've never looked at actual CP) before this. Things I look at that I'd include under this are those fake ""teen sex"" porn sites, drawings, & occasionally just looking up pictures of young children, though the latter makes me feel guilty. I've on maybe 2-4 occasions come across worse stuff & gotten off to them, but NEVER anything that was intentionally CP.   Am I a threat to society? Absolutely not. I used to not want children because of my childhood abuse (I was afraid I'd hurt my child), & then I nannied for a couple years & was a wonderful nanny. The kid I worked with did not interest me or turn me on & I did not once have a fantasy with him in it while I worked with him. The idea of touching him is literally revolting to me. However, I have imagined myself being him & being touched by an adult male since then, tying into my theory that I'm turned on not by kids, but by the idea of myself being the one victimized.  Can anyone comment on this? I'm looking for reactions & thoughts, more than anything."

FemmeThoughts,2r5iiw,miscreantpossum,3,Sat Jan 3 21:38:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think I'm a little. I was a sub (submissive) for quite some time, so I have little problem with things like this and am usually very honest with myself. But I've never had any daddy inklings in the least. Any kind of father/child play kind of grosses me out. I hope that doesn't sound insulting, because I don't mean it to be a reflection on you. I just want to express that I don't think myself to be a little.   To clarify on a few things that may have moved anyone to think this is the cause of my interest in child stuff, I was abused by my mother, not my father, growing up. Additionally, the much older man who assaulted me wasn't due to my desire to experience something like that, but rather the desires of a dom I was in a relationship with who broke said relationship off by locking me in a room with this man & never responding to my multiple phone calls to come help me. Don't know if knowing these changes your thoughts, but I realized they might've been a bit misleading.   On a side note, interestingly, my desire to sub has entirely disappeared. Part of it was the assault, perhaps, but I continued to seek out abusive relationships until I finally asked a friend to literally pick me someone good to go out with, & she found my fiancé. From day 1, he treated me with such...respect. Respect for my intelligence, for my thoughts & opinions, & also with respect for my body. It has given me so much confidence & helped my expectations of others to grow immensely, & I haven't had the slightest desire to sub since. I would've expected my need to think about children when getting off to have lessened with this, but it hasn't & I don't really know how to identify that part of myself."
FemmeThoughts,2r5iiw,anonymouss456,12,Sun Jan 4 01:13:52 2015 UTC,"The linked article is an interesting read because it offers a different and often unheard dialogue. A dialogue that is largely invisible under the intense weight of hatred and misunderstanding that western culture has toward pedophiles.  Pedophilia is a subset of paraphilic disorders in the DSM, and is defined as someone who experiences sexual attraction toward prepubescents --approximately 11 years or younger (and the person with the attraction is 16+).   Some common public misunderstandings about pedophiles are that child sex offenders are necessarily pedophiles, that all pedophiles are child sex offenders, or that pedophiles are 'unsafe' or inherently evil people.   These misconceptions are well known in the scientific community by those who study paraphilic disorders or pedophilia specifically:  ""Pedophilia, often not distinguished from the broader phenomenon of child sexual abuse in public discourse, is a specifically sexual preference for children and does not necessarily include child sexual abuse."" -- (Wiebking, 2013)  Additionally, it has been shown that pedophiles are perfectly capable of integrating into society and leading healthy, normal lives (Moser, 2001; Suppe, 1987; Wilson & Cox, 1983).  So how might a feminist look at this? I think that some of the hallmarks of the feminist perspective are its attention to society's marginalized, to voices that go unheard, and to their subsequent inclusion. I think these ideas can be applied to pedophilia as well. I think that pedophilia offers another opportunity to grapple with socially constructed perceptions of sexual normality for a positive end. I think that by creating an atmosphere of non-judgement and acceptance, as suggested in the article, it will become much easier and less socially damning for pedophiles to come out and receive social support. In doing so, I think it can foster an environment where pedophiles may be less likely to offend*.  What do ya'll think?  *There is a current controversy in the scientific community about whether pedophiles actually offend as a direct symptom of their condition --an important criteria for a condition being defined as a mental disorder, and for which evidence is currently lacking (Malon, 2013). To make this controversy worse, revisions of the DSM have moved from defining pedophilia in terms of necessitating behavior (which is criminal) to being just a ""moral-badness"" in thought (Sadler, 2009). Also embedded in this controversy is the deeper question about how the DSM functions as a tool for controlling social deviations."
FemmeThoughts,2r5iiw,NestoriM,6,Mon Jan 5 04:19:45 2015 UTC,"While we appreciate that this is a sensitive topic that may be difficult for many people to tackle, our rules still apply on this thread, and your comment has been removed for false equivalences. Equating therapy for pedophilia with gay conversation therapy is wrong, as the article goes to some lengths to explain. Comparing policing the orientation to policing abuse is another false equivalence. Additionally, it should be noted that stopping the policing of something has literally never had the effect of driving something further underground.   I understand that it may be difficult for you to distinguish between those who are attracted to children and those who abuse children, but there is a distinct difference, and it's important that when discussing this, you recognise that, even if it's difficult for you to personally handle and wrap your head around."
FemmeThoughts,2r5iiw,hermithome,2,Sat Jan 3 00:08:07 2015 UTC,"I don't see how oppression and discriminating based on this king of prejudices does any good. You cannot equate the pedophilic orientation with acts of sexual abuse. No-one can choose what he is attracted to but everyone can choose how thay act. This difference is essential to understand.  I have myself always been attracted to children. I can confirm that this is very similar as an orientation to for example homosexuality. I have never had any other kind of attraction, and I have been like this since young teenager. And the feelings are not only sexual, they are also romantic, affectionate and intimate. And nowadays there is research available that shows that this is also quite typical (Seto 2012).  You cannot police an orientation. Every day someone's child realizes that he is a pedophile, and there is nothing we know that can be done to stop it. It is not even researched. Still, it would be crucial for young pedophiles to have information available about their orientation. Too many may identify with abusers. And start thinking that society doesn't appreciate him, why would he appreciate society's norms?  You can and should police the wrongdoers."

A long time ago, on livejournal, there was an account by a man who confessed to be a pedophile.  He had never hurt a child, and had never had sex and never planned to.  His account was deleted by the admins, which caused some outrage in the community at the time- who, hearing his story, had been fairly supportive.  That's a problem- information has to get out there, and it had to be the right kind of information.

I think it nearly touches on some points that I would love to see discussed more, because I don't think I have the full experience necessary to discuss them myself. This is the relevant part:   Some people may love to flip their way through Jack London's manly adventures; others may find a novel's worth of cruelty to animals so upsetting as to be unreadable. Some people may love the sweep and romance of Gone With the Wind; for others, the unrelenting, vicious racism may be off-putting.   The idea that your own experiences weigh so heavily on our interpretations and enjoyment of the ""classics"" should not be such a novel concept to me, but it is. The idea that, if you dislike a classic, you just aren't trying hard enough is not a novel concept, however.   When you combine the two with the fact that most of what's celebrated has been written by people with the most privilege...the whole system starts to feel a little aggressive. It's just one more way in which people who don't fit the narrow ideal are told, ""society is not yours and you do not belong here.""  That's my rather limited take on it, but I'd love to see this idea discussed more fully."

This shouldn't be a novel concept, but in many ways, it is. This is sorta the companion piece to the defence of ""guilty pleasure"" media: why should we feel like we're wrong about what we like?  And it's so immensely tied into privilege. There's so much critically acclaimed stuff that I struggle to read through - not because it's hard, but because it's SO boring, and SO sexist. The number of critical acclaimed books that are mostly a male narrator angry at all the women for not liking him are WAY TOO HIGH.   Several months ago, I was reading a bunch of classic sci-fi and after like the fifth or sixth grossly misogynistic, not-to-clever book, I just stopped and said that I didn't care if they were classics, I wasn't going to be arsed. And then a few months later, when I really wanted to sci-fi binge, I just started going through the shelves and looking for something different. I read the summary and review and asked myself if this felt like something I would enjoy reading. If the characters sounded like something other than the standard assdrips I was SO tired of. And I explicitly looked for women authors. I ended up going on a huge feminist sci-fi binge, and holy crap, it was SO MUCH FUN."

In the last year or so, I've just become SO fed up with what I've been sarcastically calling ""white dude opinions"". I love reading, especially fantasy and sci fi, and I love plenty of male authors' work - but I'm so goddamn tired of not being able to find a diversity of perspectives without some serious digging. I actually didn't feel like I could fully articulate my feelings about the topic until I read this article, so very sincere thanks for posting it!  I've made an effort to populate this year's reading list with more women, and especially more women of color. It's a start, but I'd like to do even better.   Do you read much dystopian fiction? I read a fair amount of it, spanning classic, modern, and YA. One idea in particular that has started to gnaw at me is the different levels of engagement I feel with different dystopian set-ups - some are just viscerally terrifying, some are much less so, and some in different ways. I'm beginning to notice patterns in which ones really get to me, and the gender or experiences of the author. I'm wondering if dystopian fiction is particularly amplifying in regards to our biases and fears, because it deals so directly with what the author considers a credible and concerning threat to society. This might also be true of science fiction in general, but I think in a less focused way. Any thoughts?"
FemmeThoughts,2r4ag7,concise_dictionary,1 point,Sun Jan 4 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"I don't read a tonne of dystopian fiction, but I do read a fair amount, as it crosses over with sci-fi a lot. And yeah, I think it's easier to fall into certain pitfalls in the genre. From the outset in dystopian fiction, people are going to die, a lot of them. And you can only show the concerns of so many people. So I think, who the author chooses to humanise, who they choose to use as fodder or the bad guy, what concerns they elevate: that hugely affects the story. And I think it's one reason that I often dislike dystopian fiction.   I think the same amplification exists in sci-fi in general, because there aren't really a lot of rules. If instead of using current society, you're going to create one, the work is much more subject to your biases and privileges. You get to create new technologies and how you imagine this stuff being used is again, incredibly subject to your biases and privileges. Dystopian fic pushes this even more. At the outset, you're either dealing with a ruined world, or a world about to be ruined. This means a lot of death, and a lot of death that's considered not very important. The level of destruction and death always outnumbers the number of people the author gets to humanise. And it outnumbers it epically. We're not talking simple addition or multiplication here, we're talking about outnumbering exponetially.  Death and destruction is a base setting for the world, and doesn't engender much care. The naval gazing of the protagonist is more important then the death of civilisation. So the stakes are just so much higher. What the protagonist thinks about and who dies is crucial. If you cannot empathise with the protagonist or the main characters in a dystopian fic, that's hard. If you empathise more with the redshirts - that's just so fucking painful to read.   A lot of dystopian fic is white dude opinions on crack. It especially bugs me when the protagonist spends ages agonising over his situation. It's either ""oh, how I miss the good old days when life was amazing and easy and the world would have been my oyster"" or its ""life is so hard, no one else has had to struggle as hard as I have, woe is me"". And both of those are just so nauseatingly blinded, privileged and whine-y that it drives me up a wall.  Triton by Delany is an especially bad example of this:   Trouble On Triton  The human race has colonized the outer satellites. One of them is Triton, moon of Nepture, where the ideals of universal prosperity are possible. Yet Earth threatens war . . .  Within this strange climate of complete utopia and certain doom, Bron Helstrom seeks passion and purpose in a gypsy woman whose wisdom and power will forever reverse his life.   The entire book is naval-gazing misogynistic tripe (also homophobic and transphobic). The utopia is apparently entirely designed so that handsome white dude can feel like he's oppressed. Because the woman he wants to be his magic pixie dreamgirl isn't interested in the position. She has a job and a life and other lovers and has zero interest in changing him or changing her world to revolve around him. Poor Bron :(. And the massive war and certain destruction is literally all just a backdrop for Bron's manfeels about women and about how hard he has it.   Triton was one of those books in the last batch of classic stuff I read where I just went nope, nope, nope. I think the one that literally pushed me over the edge was a different book where the protagonist rapes a woman, and you don't even realise because of the way it's describe until she confronts him about it half a book later. And then of course, promptly goes to work for him. Ugggh.  I think one of the reasons sci-fi disappoints me so much is because it's so open ended. There are so many possibilities. And I love good sci-fi so much. So this stuff bugs me not just because it's super misogynistic, but because it's so boring. You can write ANY story! You can create ANY world! So why are so many authors writing the same, boring, cliché, tropey crap over and over?  That said, there's a lot of great stuff out there. And I've read a fair amount of really good dystopian and apocalyptic sci-fi by some really awesome feminist writers lately.  For me, it's pretty simple. The time where I could read everything ever written has long passed. And I don't get to read 16 hours a day. There's a limited amount of stuff I get to read in my life. And I'm not going to waste it reading crap just because other people like crap. The quality of a book is very much in the eye of its beholder. So what I like really matters."

FemmeThoughts,2qywzv,INTPLibrarian,16,Thu Jan 1 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"She has a few points here, some of which seem better than others.   The one I think is strongest is that there's a bit of a Catch-22 for freeing nipples for the average non-celebrity. There's stigma attached to naked images, so we can't post naked images, so there's stigma attached, lather rinse repeat. We can say that shouldn't be the case all we want, but it is. A friend of mine has done some nude modeling, and the photos are on the internet and easily found with her name. She's proud of them and has zero problem with her nudity. It has also caused her professional problems several times in her second career, no matter how she has approached it (or not) with management.   Point two that she makes is that this campaign is skewed towards a particular type of body and a particular race and a particular class. This is, it seems to me, largely due to stigma... Being able to post photos of your breasts and be assured it will not negatively impact your life is a privilege most of us don't yet have.   Where she lost me was with the tone of hostility toward the celebrities doing this. I don't know where the leap got made from, ""Most women don't have this privilege,"" to, ""So you shouldn't either, celebrities."" It is admittedly hard to see anything transgressive about Miley Cyrus's breasts being on the Internet, BUT... let's see this instead as baby steps, and seeds of thought.   Chelsea Handler is 39. While that isn't at all old, she IS close to the age where women are often dismissed as past their prime or some silly horseshit, and she's showing off her breasts and not caring at all what people think. That's cool. I'm in my 30s and I like seeing that. It may not make me put my breasts on the internet, but it could empower me some other way.   Alyssa Milano recently posted photos of herself breastfeeding. It raised some controversy, but she came out looking classy and I think it was very much in the true spirit of freeing nipples... Perhaps a non-celebrity mom will feel more confident posting because she saw that.   My point is, hopefully these are gateway breasts, and get conversation going about it and maybe challenge some people to question what would be so wrong about nipples. If that happens, maybe there will be more of the breasts the author wanted to see in the first place."
FemmeThoughts,2qywzv,electrostaticrain,5,Thu Jan 1 09:47:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't really read it as her saying that the celebrities that are doing it shouldn't do it just because the average person can't do it.  (Though, this is coming from my memory of reading it yesterday; I should re-read it.)    I took it as her wishing that those celebrities would at least acknowledge that not everyone can do it.  And that there would be a huge backlash if, say, (trying to think of a not-traditionally hot actress who is still really popular... I'm not that celebrity savvy...)  Carol Burnett started walking around showing her nipples.  Let alone, your average non-celebrity.  All-in-all, I think that an essay that has a lot of good points is still worth reading even if there are some not-so-good points included.  I'm glad you took the time to point them out.  I, too, hope these are ""gateway breasts"" and I see the value in pointing out that they ARE gateway, not the done-deal."
FemmeThoughts,2qywzv,electrostaticrain,3,Thu Jan 1 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"I was looking at the last paragraph or two:  ""But what is offensive is fighting a war in the name of all women and all women’s bodies, and saying that only some women can reap the spoils of it. What is offensive is saying that “women’s bodies shouldn’t be censored,” when that actually means “women’s bodies shouldn’t be censored, if other men want to have sex with them.”  There is nothing offensive about #FreeingTheNipple, provided all sorts of #nipples and all sorts of female bodies can be #free. But until that’s the case, I’m not going to pat celebrities on the back for showing off what God (or the plastic surgeon in Sherman Oaks) gave them.""  That's where I saw the hostility for celebrity women because they are currently privileged in a way that she is not - I read it as though she believes that they are agents of oppression rather than well-intentioned (if privileged) allies. I read it (admittedly at 4am) as saying that she intends to find the entire concept offensive until all nipples are free.   That's certainly her right; it's possible that she's just speaking more generally, but it certainly seems she's talking about these women. She's entitled to feel however she wants; like I said, that was just where she lost me. I do think the rest of the essay made some great points about a lot of unexamined privilege inherent in this campaign, for sure."

I think it's pretty clear that she doesn't find the entire concept offensive until all nipple are free. But she is pissed off that the privileged people at the centre of this campaign seem very unaware of how privileged they are. And the discourse they use to talk about what's happened is very privileged and very blind.  It is possible to be an agent for progressive change with still being oppressive. And that's a bit of what's happening now. Not because the privileged cannot or should not fight. But because when they do, it's important that they recognise that they are privileged and that their actions don't universally speak for all women. And it's important that the discourse they use, reflect that.  Though I do agree with you about her language. While I hate tone-policing, and I think that there's a lot of value in being angry, I think she explained it a bit poorly. The privilege part she explained well, but she didn't take the next step and explain what that privilege means in the course of activism and dialogue about oppression.  I also wasn't sure at points if the essay was aimed at the celebrities' blindness, or at the way that regular people are responding to this movement. I think she intended the latter, but doesn't make that clear always? It might be one of those essays that's in response to how something is being received, and if you aren't in the midst of the movement, and seeing that reception, it's lost on you."

FemmeThoughts,2qywzv,hermithome,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:28:51 2015 UTC,"The title seems very clear that it's aimed at people responding to the celebs, but it sorta loses that clarity as the article goes on, and it's easy to think that she's addressing the celebs directly.  And yeah, while I'm aware of some of this stuff, I really don't follow celeb activism, and haven't been following this discussion, so I'm out of the loop there as well.  I do understand why people don't want to spend the time doing that backstory. It can be exhausting, and people often feel you haven't properly characterised the debate, and need to include wide background information. That is, not just what the people you're responding to have been saying, but what everyone else is too. And at the end of the day, you're writing for the people who are involved, not anyone else.  I also understand the power and importance of writing something more immediate, for a specific moment and audience, and it's a well respected format. In fact, most op-eds take this sort of format.   That said, I do wish more authors would include at least some background when doing a response piece. I think a lot of these pieces are important and the have less power outside the immediate moment and audience by not being more widely accessible. Though maybe the piece being more clearly directed would have done the trick. I'm not sure."

Not everyone can take the kind of action you want, which is something the author pointed out. That doesn't mean that those people aren't allowed to point out that there's a problem.

FemmeThoughts,2qyoif,hermithome,14,Wed Dec 31 23:20:32 2014 UTC,"I did research a while back with some scientists at the Santa Fe Institute on cities with Luis Bettencourt, the preeminent expert on city dynamics. They are really fascinating to study. We looked at many factors of cities including income, crime, innovation, utility usage, population, etc.  One of the key results was that cities appear to be scaled versions of each other. Regardless of culture, government type, or even economy, there are universal traits that all cities shared. It was as if there was only one city. Whether they were towns of 40,000 or mega-cities of 20 million, they constituted scaled and randomly distributed versions of this 'core' city.  Another fascinating result was that city planning and government policies, unless they involve an incredible overhaul (with tons of money) do almost nothing to budge a city's relative status over many decades. This puts a huge dent in ambitions of 'garden city' planners and planners in general.  Drawing from these and other results that we have found, I would argue that urban planners have little to no control over many key characteristics of cities. So I would expect that if women had not been exluded as planners, cities would still not be fundamentally different than the cities we have now. They may be unique in superficial ways, just as cities of different cultures are superficially unique. This means that outwardly they may look different, have different architecture, different kinds of buildings, different layouts, and so forth, but under the hood, when looking at broad indicators like resource consumption, crime, GDP, and innovation, they should work the same.  While it may seem a bit counter-intuitive that city planners don't really control city formation, that is exactly what the data suggests. It doesn't appear that anyone controls it. From what we can tell there are much stronger and more fundamental rules at play. There are a handful of exceptions and those exceptions, where national governments can tilt the balance, are quite extreme.  As far as creating an ideal feminist and marginalized friendly city is concerned, I think that it is possible in principle to do, but I think that the approach toward achieving it would not be through centralized planning, but by discovering what rules of human interaction drive city formation and then adjust those rules as best as we can to facilitate more desirable city formation. I think this issue is quite tough because it is confounded with broader social, economic, and political problems at a national level.

Also if you dont feel like your choice is being embraced.....keep in mind that people will judge you for everything.  If you were a career woman, they would call you a bad mom for sticking the kids in daycare.  If you're a house wife, people accuse you of being a mindless stepford wife.  When you're a newly wed, people rudely ask when you're gonna have kids. When you have the first kid, people ask when you're gonna have another.

I've seen many Western women hold themselves back from demanding respect for fear of being disliked for it. Its all related western feminist talking topics such as the boss/bitch double standard, women's excessive apologizing and how often women are interrupted or talked over.

FemmeThoughts,2qvx24,theaftstarboard,9,Sat Jan 3 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"That's because the do their statistics differently. There is no across the board way of measuring and so not all countries' results are comparable. For example, one calculation that goes into that measurement is job equality. How much income disparity do women with the same occupation, qualifications, and years in the field experience when compared to their male counterparts? Seems pretty straight forward, right? Japan and a few European countries only calculate this measurement by job title whereas the US calculates it based on similar job descriptions. What we've found is that the same jobs (receptionist vs. administrative assistant) are gender coded in that they do identical work but women tend to get hired into only one of the positions and that position is paid less overall. This is a form of the gender pay gap not taken into account in the Japan measurement.   Another example of statistics being incomparable because of varying measurement are international rape statistics. Sometimes countries with the highest reports of rape incidents actually tend to be the most progressive on rape because they actually do victimization surveys instead of count convictions and consider things like spousal lack of consent to be rape. You'll occasionally get a third party that comes in and does an accurate victimization survey but you can't trust the comparability of a lot of countries' self reporting, particularly the most sexist ones."

My feminism will be intersectional or it will be bullshit is a confrontational essay. Its hard to read. I still feel defensive reading it. But its also a lot of truth and a lot to handle.  If your friend isn't aware of power structures that use race and income disparity and ableism and homophobia along with sexism to hurt us all - she's severely limited.  Objectification is a harder issue. I think this statement is true:   WE ARE EMPOWERED BY DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE OUR LIVES AND EXPERIENCES ARE DIFFERENT.     And I think claiming these women alone are responsible for their objectification is problematic. There is an entire economic system based around exploitation of the female form. For Nicki or Rihanna, ownership over the visual communicated of their body may be really empowering. Nicki has been outspoken. Its okay to say ""hey, that's great that you are into your body. The dudes feeding off that are kinda gross though."" (I'm not going to pretend here that I don't also probably objectify dudes...)  It's okay that its complicated. I'm much more concerned that your friend is completely denying intersectionality. Related Annie Lennox issue brings a larger question of if its possible to have publicly positive sexuality that isn't objectifying or demeaning.   That's hard. And its okay to say other people can have different feminisms or act differently. Ex; I find Beyonce's referencing of Ike & Tina Turner problematic. I find Beyonce's music and career choices incredibly inspiring. I'm not going to condemn her over one lyric when she also proudly called herself a feminist and runs her life and career impressively, taking control from her father."

FemmeThoughts,2qptjq,kickshaw,14,Mon Dec 29 19:31:15 2014 UTC,"If you freed a slave and they continued to work for their ex-master for free, that's their choice and 100% okay. To say they should not do that is to deny their autonomy, to try to make a slave of them again.   While I understand the point you're making here and I don't want to derail the discussion, this analogy is a little problematic—in a way that's still on-topic to this discussion. Historically, after the official end of slavery, freed slaves and other black people in the U.S. were (and still are) systematically oppressed by a racist system that sought to preserve the racist status quo through discrimination in both culture and law: Jim Crow laws, segregation laws, miscegenation laws, exploitative sharecropping contracts, poll taxes, etc.  After the Civil War, a freed black U.S. slave might continue to work on a farm for his former owner for free, and in a way, that's 100% his choice. But that freedman is living in a society in which he likely has little or no money or property of his own; white capitalists/owners who refuse to hire black workers or to sell supplies and property to black entrepreneurs (if they have money) or do so at exploitative rates; there are few if any black people in positions of power to look out for black interests, and few if any black voters with full suffrage. In a system like this, the freedman's choice to work for his owner is not a free choice, it's a desperate one made under duress.  So that's what some feminists, especially in second-wave feminism, argue about women participating in and celebrating their own ""objectification"": that even if women choose to do it and find it personally empowering, it's still a choice made under duress in a sexist system designed to coerce the objectification of women.  This isn't an argument that I necessarily agree with, and like any political viewpoint, there are still plenty of people who subscribe to the less-nuanced view of ""pandering to the male gaze!"" But it's a lot more complex feminist problem than just ""people who haven't educated themselves."""
FemmeThoughts,2qptjq,hermithome,6,Mon Dec 29 17:05:32 2014 UTC,"I like Nicki Minaj and Rihanna too, because I know they're powerful people in their own right. I've educated myself. But those who have not educated themselves, all they see is the pandering to the male gaze.   This is a good point. I've taken the time to learn about each of these women because I admire what they've done, and that probably informs my interpretation of their work in a way that it might not with someone who hasn't done the same.    It's dicey because for a long time the male gaze was the only power we had.   This idea always fascinates me, and I get wanting to move beyond that - but I also get the idea of not wanting to give up the power we already have in hopes of achieving another, different power."

""White women’s feminisms still center around equality, a point on which Traister and Shulevitz converge. Black women’s feminisms demand justice. There is a difference.  One kind of feminism focuses on the policies that will help women integrate fully into the existing American system. The other recognizes the fundamental flaws in the system and seeks its complete and total transformation.""   ...   All it means is that we have to allow figures like Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj to stumble and course-correct in the same way we do for white public figures. When you're white, the feminist label is almost literally shoved down your throat, and you're criticized for not identifying with the movement. When you're black, your right to do the same is questioned at every turn and actively denied at an institutional level. This division is so clearly racist in nature, and yet mainstream feminism has the audacity to turn around and chastise women of colour who do not wish to identify with your movement.   ...   WE ARE EMPOWERED BY DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE OUR LIVES AND EXPERIENCES ARE DIFFERENT.    And if what's empowering for someone else isn't empowering for us? That's okay too. Our feminisms don't have to match."
FemmeThoughts,2qptjq,kickshaw,5,Mon Dec 29 23:00:56 2014 UTC,"I think it's all about consciousness. It's about knowing how we are socialized to seek approval for our looks, to appeal to men, etc. and then making a conscious choice whether to do that or not. There's nothing wrong with doing it, consciously and conscientiously... there is something wrong with saying ""Oh, come on now, it's not anti-feminist that women are expected to look nice! I do this for ME, not for anyone else! I can't believe some women hate themselves and their bodies so much that they are embarrassed to be seen..."" or what-have-you. Even if the statement isn't explicit, there's a lot of subtle shaming of those who don't buy in when women defend these choices.  So, if you say something like ""Yes, I enjoy appealing to the male gaze. I feel powerful when I can command attention that way, and I feel good about myself through it. That may have a lot to do with my gender socialization, but I'm fine with that,"" then it's all good. The most anti-feminist thing there is is prescribing choices for women as ""good"" or ""bad"" on their face, based on their gender."

Cars made by companies that have a history of dumping toxic waste onto native american land then denying the damage done.  Cars that burn enough fuel to power two other cars and barely pass (if they pass) smog tests (cali is pretty strict tho).  I think it helps to be pretty vocal about the things you don't like.  I support games that do justice to their female characters, and I make sure to make note of that if I am able to write a survey (like with most Nintendo games).

FemmeThoughts,2qg3ti,nightride,24,Fri Dec 26 14:31:04 2014 UTC,"I think a lot of the reason sexism, misogyny, assault and other problems are able to fester and grow in these communities is because there are women out there who have more of a vested interest in protecting these communities from criticism than in protecting other women.   That, and women give progressive men the same goodwill as the men give themselves. Like with all subtle and pervasive ideas, scapebroing probably affects all genders after all. Though a lot of women have their trust abused by these men at some point and it tends to knock the naïvité out of them.  Yeah, I recognise a lot of this. I've seen men get away with completely ridiculous behaviour and other men who just could not stop their chronic mansplaining. No eyebrows were raised, that was apparently just how it was."

FemmeThoughts,2qg3ti,hermithome,2,Sat Dec 27 11:27:02 2014 UTC,"I was here first! *crosses arms* No, but they're referring to what's typically known as white feminism, right? I think it's interesting, and I think that explains tumblr feminism (the bad kind), but I'm not sure I see the relevancy here.  What I'm saying is that it's highly unlikely that women of any class is unaffected by the same cultural forces that shape the ideas of men. So if our culture pushes the idea that masculinity is linked to tallness then it pushes that idea onto women too - and unless she makes a conscious effort to reject this idea she would probably buy it too. Or, say your subculture has a narrative where the traditionally masculine guy (""the jock"") is a bully and the nerdy, intellectual type is most definitely the good guy then women aren't immune to that either. It occurs to me that a lot of somewhat ""geeky"" female spaces (trollx for instance) uses a sort of dudebro myth, which clearly plays into this idea (it invokes this image of a sexually aggressive, insufferable frat guy), to separate somebody clearly from the tribe, ""he's not a 'good guy', he is a dudebro"". The men are far less subtle for their own reasons, you can catch them literally saying ""he's bad cos he's a dudebro"".  Anyway, the 'progressive' men in general have a lot of little things playing in their favour. A sexist backdrop, quirky social rules, unwillingness to make a fuss, the fact that people are human and they like each other and a blinded by that -- a lot of the time it's also just the fact that if they're friends of friends or whatever that means somebody somewhere okayed them down the line and who am I to question that, so on.  e: I thought I had a point but I rambled instead."

What I learned, ultimately, from long discussion with my feminist allies at the time was how I had been contributing to this.  It's often easy to not notice intersectionality.  I remember one time when I was at a retreat and I was asked to define environmentalism. I gave a pretty specific response that I think most people would agree with, but a Justice Studies professor there wanted to distinguish ""environmental justice"" from ""environmentalism"" calling environmentalism a ""white movement"" and environmental justice a movement for ""people of color"". I took a lot of offense to that, but I later complied with her line of thinking.  There really is a race/sex/culture hierarchy in social justice movements and it's awful. After that meeting I started paying attention and noticing how often my male peers would talk over my female peers, how the white folk such as myself would be invited to the major events when the people of color were not. It wasn't so deliberate as much as it was a vestigial property of the discriminatory connotations of our society.   It's going to take deliberate effort to change this, especially from the men who perpetuate it, such as myself."
FemmeThoughts,2qg3ti,hermithome,10,Fri Dec 26 20:00:20 2014 UTC,"The problem is that you had to become aware of this first.  When I became a TA, we had to attend a workshop about various issues that can arrise regarding sex, gender, race, etc. One of the main topics was 'micro-inequities', which are those little things that people do but are not necessarily conscious of, like talking over woman or interupting them, or excluding someone of a difference race in a group activity (it can be a really subtle thing).  Once you go through that you just start seeing things everywhere that you didn't notice before. That was when I realized how automatic these things must be for so many people. That it probably never even enters their consciousness.  Humans are only so good at theory-of-mind, we shouldn't expect much overlap of understanding when different people have very different experiences and perspectives in life. That is why I think it is important for people to continue sharing their experiences with others.

That statement is used partially because of this exact mentality:   Where do you even start?    The people who say, ""it's not my job to educate you,"" are saying that because how would you even start to do that? It's exhausting to try, quite frankly, and also the internet exists. It's a brilliant source of information 3.5 billion people can access. If someone wants to know, they can do so at a click of a button. People say ""it's not my job to educate you,"" because it's not.

We've seen this with certain politicians, for instance, who might be homophobes for most of their lives, until suddenly their children come out and they realise 'Oh, turns out I've known a gay person all my life. They're not so bad. I guess we can be equal after all'.  That kind of experience isn't universal, since there are a lot of kids who come out to their religiously fundamentalist parents and are then cast out of their homes for their trouble.  With other people it might be a question of ignorance or lack of consideration. I spoke to a mate of mine, also a Socialist, who was a reductionist until I explained to him that Patriarchy existed long before the Class system. That it was a concept that yes, Capitalism has exacerbated by incorporating it into itself, but otherwise would still be present in its cultural form post-Revolution. Same as Racism and other phobias. He understood and it took considerably less time to change his mind.  For most men, unfortunately, sexism is a normalised, internalised, micro expression of what they've learned as children and grow up to perpetuate and reinforce in society around them. It's in the 'women love to shop' jokes, in the 'make me a sammich' talk. In the movies where women are consistently called bitches and skanks. In video-games where they're scenery decorations or stock characters. Where they're treated like property, married off like a bargaining chip. Where they grow up to see their fathers invest in them and their brothers education, but not their sisters because 'that's okay she'll find a husband to take care of her'.  It's in all of those sexist, bullshit things that we're constantly seeing around us, being bombarded with, implicitly and explicitly, covertly and overtly, over and over, a million times a day, every day of our lives.  I'm sure a segment of men out there, who are sexist, are not so much 'sexists' in that they are actively even aware that they're sexist, but display such gender, racial, etc, incesitivity because they literally know nothing else. And when that comfortable foundation of prejudice is shifted beneath their feet, when we feminists come about and tell them 'you're sexist', their go-to response is outrage and mansplaining.  Would some of them change their mind? Maybe. The problem is that people (generally) when confronted with criticism have as an immediate response a desire to defend themselves. That's where being open-minded comes in.  The first time someone told me the word 'bitch' was sexist, my immediate go-to response was. 'Are you kidding me?'. Thankfully it didn't last anymore than five minutes. Time enough for my friend to explain to me how it was a gendered slur that insulted a person purely for being of that gender, and nothing else. It took me a while to wrap my head around it and understood why she was right. It helped when she further explained that if I wanted to insult a person who was being a jerk to me, and who happened to be a woman, to use a nice gender neutral insult. Like 'Asshole'. We all have one, after all x3  So yeah. Different approaches for different people."

FemmeThoughts,2qg3ti,Adahn5,10,Sat Dec 27 14:38:21 2014 UTC,"I'll never forget how I felt the first time I read about some of those examples the author describes.  The stuff about Richard Dawkins never surprised me since I had read he was pretty much an asshole in general.  However, as a reader of Skeptic magazine, the information about Michael Shermer made me feel so depressed.  I remember that feeling of disappointment, betrayal and hopelessness as I read about the problem of misogyny in supposedly  progressive circles.  The deeply depressing notion that misogyny and sexism is simply too ingrained in society and human nature.  It made me think about all the other related issues, like racism and homophobia.  That maybe prejudice is just written into our genetic code and we'll never get past it.      I try not to feel that way.  I'm generally an optimistic person for the most part.  It's hard not to want to just give up the fight sometimes, though."
FemmeThoughts,2qg3ti,sillandria,2,Sat Dec 27 15:06:17 2014 UTC,"It really can feel like an impossible task, and history goes back and forth on many of these issues, but progress can be made.  Sometimes I think it's best, when feeling over whelmed, to remember that it's alright to work from small to big.  Two specific issues which have, through hard work and toil, made progress are abortion/birth control rights, and same sex marriage.  Neither have put the bigger issues at work to rest, and neither are secured, but it is progress."

FemmeThoughts,2qg3ti,sillandria,9,Sat Dec 27 16:22:40 2014 UTC,"This article makes some very important points. Overall, radical left-wing political activists are more focused on, and opposed to, sexism within the community and society as a whole. However, there is a small minority of people within leftist political circles who will perpetuate sexism, and some others who will tolerate it.  Personally, I don't think it should be tolerated. Anyone who is a sexist, or any sort of bigot, should not be welcomed or accepted within radical politics. Taking a strong stance against those types of ideas, will lead to a drastic reduction in actions of violence against women."

We're going back again messaging each other like friends again, she does it again.

FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,thatsnotgneiss,31,Wed Dec 24 22:04:57 2014 UTC,"I don't really see how these people can be defined as ""my-way-or-the-highway"" feminists. They are a group of friends who bond over a subject they agree on and I don't see how that makes them any more exclusionary then a group of friends that agree on topics that aren't feminism. They politely acknowledged her viewpoints when she stated them and, as far as I can tell from the facts given, they didn't berate her for having a different opinion.   Lets say I had lunch with a group of friends who love Game of Thrones, only I hate Game of Thrones. I mention that I don't really like GoT which the acknowledge but disagree with and then keep talking about how much they like it.  I think I would be hesitant to label this exclusionary (I am not being discouraged from entering the conversation I just won't be agreed with), and I think its ridiculous to label this ""my-way-or-the-highway"" TV/book discussion.   She got together with a bunch of friends who agreed with eachother and not with her. That might be annoying but I don't think the fact that feminism is whats being discussed has anything to do with that. Being included in a discussion doesn't mean being agreed with. If you feel excluded because your friends share an opinion you don't and you can't handle being politely acknowledged and disagreed with, maybe you just need different friends."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,Lalaithial,17,Wed Dec 24 22:20:48 2014 UTC,"I agree with you. Also, as one of those non-shaving feminists this story is about, I have to say it's really really really nice and liberating to talk to someone who also doesn't shave and sort of encourage each other. I mean, even though I have chosen not to shave doesn't mean that I'm not affected by societys beauty standards when it comes to shaving. I have doubts all the time. That's why I view OPs story more as a talking and encouraging each other rather than excluding someone. If that makes sense."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,expensivehugs,15,Thu Dec 25 09:13:05 2014 UTC,"I really don't think this story is ""feminists showing their true colours"" so much as ""friends bonding over what they have in common."" When people get caught up talking about stuff they have in common, it does make you feel left out if you're not into that stuff. It happens to everyone. Like when you're single and all your friends are talking about their boyfriends / girlfriends. Or when you don't have kids and all your friends are talking about their kids. It's part of life to feel left out now and then."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,amgov,9,Thu Dec 25 23:50:02 2014 UTC,"Ehhhh, it's super hard to comment on this because it's a post of someone else's post who is already gone, but to keep it simple:  when I think of exclusionary feminism, this definitely is not what I think of, to say the least."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,SixAMThrowaway,19,Thu Dec 25 20:55:07 2014 UTC,"Moderator note:  While we're happy to allow a discussion of feminism, please keep discussion a bit more generic. This is a story that we're now hearing third hand, and most of the comments that I've had to remove so far have not just commented on the specifics in a third hand story, but additionally assumed and passed judgement. Not okay."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,GlassHouseResident,14,Thu Dec 25 09:27:22 2014 UTC,"I'm a little confused about this post then and what our response to it should be.  It is a specific person's story about judging people who judged her, reported third hand after the original author deleted the original thread and her account (for reasons I might guess but won't assume), which is being offered as a point of discussion, but which we also aren't allowed to specifically reference in our comments or pass judgment on?  (DISCLAIMER:  I didn't get to see the removed comments before they were removed, so I am missing some context.)"
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,hermithome,6,Thu Dec 25 05:14:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much. The post is really, really borderline for us. Posting third-hand stories is a bad idea. It's not like the users can give advice or support, because we're too many degrees of separation away from anyone involved in the story. Which means that the only things left are to take the specifics and judge and try and determine who was right or who behaved badly (which is really bad taste and totally pointless), or to use this particular story as a jumping off point for a wider range of discussion.  OP specifically asked for an adult conversation sans mansplaining, so we're going to allow the conversation to happen here. But we're not going to allow people to lawyer over particulars of the story."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,abidail,10,Thu Dec 25 05:57:48 2014 UTC,"I obvious cannot comment on any of the OPs experiences, but I don't see any of the specifics she mentioned as really out there.  Not every personal choice that every woman makes is feminist. That doesn't make it a bad choice, or wrong. It doesn't make the choice anti-feminist. It's just not necessarily feminist. For example, there is nothing about shaving your legs that's an inherently feminist act. Shaving your legs generally means conforming to the male gaze and a specific ideal of feminine beauty.  That doesn't mean that it's bad. It doesn't mean that you can't be a feminist and shave your legs (many feminists do). It just means that it's not a feminist act. That's okay.   Now, there are situations where shaving your legs can be pretty radical. For example, women who are normally viewed as outside of the male gaze and not sexual - acts that aren't normally that radical can be for them.  Also, most people are ""a little gay"", or at least would be if not for heavy duty hereto socialisation. Doesn't mean it's bad or gross or weird if you aren't.  I obviously don't know about how the situation happened, or what it was that made OP so uncomfortable. I don't know if these friends were being overly judgemental or what. But the specific facts that were mentioned are fairly basic, though they do vary depending on what school of feminism you're discussing."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,hermithome,38,Thu Dec 25 01:06:49 2014 UTC,"I don't know, as a bisexual woman, the ""every person is a little gay/bi"" makes me cringe super hard.  That narrative directly contributes to the erasure and dismissal of my sexuality as legitimate."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,DeseretRain,13,Thu Dec 25 02:45:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah, good point, it depends how it's stated/phrased, and what the context and awareness is. I'm fairly sure that they were referencing that Kinsey absolutes are rare, but the language ""everyone is a little gay"" says way more than that and is dismissive."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,hermithome,16,Thu Dec 25 04:56:23 2014 UTC,"But the Kinsey scale isn't even meant to be about orientation, it's meant to be an index of experiences. The idea that it's about orientation is a common misconception, but that's never what it was meant to be.   For instance, say a straight woman tried making out with another woman once just to see if she liked it, but it turned out she didn't enjoy it and never wanted to do it again. Her orientation would still be straight since she actually has no attraction to women, yet the fact that she made out with a woman would add some points on the Kinsey scale. Even briefly considering the idea of sex with your same gender can up your Kinsey score, but that doesn't make a person ""a little bit gay"" or ""a little bit bi."" And Kinsey understood that, he never meant the scale to be indicative of sexual orientation.   I'm also bisexual and I agree that the idea that everyone is ""a little gay"" or ""a little bi"" just contributes to bi erasure. The whole idea is based on a misunderstanding of what the Kinsey scale means, and it ends up lumping us in with straight people as if there's no REAL difference between a bisexual person and a straight person who maybe once had a weird dream about a same sex sexual encounter."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,hermithome,2,Thu Dec 25 01:15:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I know. They were either referring to Kinsey poorly, or talking about how people would be oriented without the kind of socialisation we have now. I'm guessing Kinsey simply because some of the language used makes me suspect that's what they were referring to. But my comments were super confusing because my first comment is addressing it assuming they're discussing socialisation effects, and my second is assuming they mean Kinsey and that's just a confusing mess.   So first off, sorry for that. Addressing multiple things without ever making it clear that I was switching trains of thought is confusing as fuck.  Anyway, yes, I totally agree with your thoughts with regard to how Kinsey is mistreated in this manner. And frankly, even if they were discussing how people would be oriented without socialisation, the comment is still super eh."
FemmeThoughts,2qbckf,nightride,8,Thu Dec 25 01:55:11 2014 UTC,"The problem is that they are saying there is only one way to be a feminist, and it is like this and this and this.    We don't know that they are though, we know that OP thought that they were being judgemental, but it's really hard to tell, and as I warned earlier, we shouldn't focus on the specifics of the situation. Attempting to rehash a third-hand story is a bit ridiculous.  The specific statements that body hair removal isn't feminist and so on are mostly right. That doesn't mean that these things define someone or their identity. Many of these are things that feminists do. But the specific actions they mentioned are not feminist. That's all I was saying.  Now, if they are shaming or judging someone for making a particular choice, that's a problem. But saying that (for example) shaving you legs isn't a feminist act isn't judgemental or shaming. And it's not wrong either."

I have had to do this plenty of times when out presenting as a woman. Being trans means that I have to be extra careful. If someone is hitting on me and I am not interested I have two default responses, ""I have a boyfriend,"" or the more risky, ""I'm gay."" (I am actually pansexual). Both avoid the potentially dangerous affects of revealing my transgenderism (is that a word?). It should be noted that I don't really have a default response to women hitting on me, since I don't really have to worry about them flipping out on me."

I told him if he’s really that dissatisfied with his own backpack, he should just return it to the store and buy one like mine instead of criticizing me all the time, because from what I can see, my backpack’s only advantage is that it comes with a more positive attitude and frugal spending habit than all the other backpacks.

As if PoC aren't tokenized and erased enough, there absolutely is a one-sided narrative that we have to fit in and suck it up because we provide diversity - the irony is that assimilated PoC really don't provide much actual diversity because of how much our perspectives and experienced are erased through assimilation.   I can personally say that I'm fearful to engage professionally in my field (I would like to pursue a career in academia), in large part because it would likely mean leaving my home state where I'm a fairly common racial mix, and going to an area where being mixed-race in general, much less part-Hawaiian, would undoubtedly be a tiny minority, and where I expect my heritage, particularly my indigenous/island heritage, to be systematically erased, something that occurs even within some communities of color.    And I've also had friends who felt much the same way - even some from other parts of the country who felt that sense of coming home when they lived in my state. It's a very complex social and psychological issue, but it's very apparent to me that belonging and feeling like part of the community is a huge part of one's total wellbeing."

They reported how astonished they were at HOW MUCH racism they encountered. Now, Los Angeles is a city with a fairly large population from several Asian nationalities/ethnicities; I doubt that Japanese Americans who grew up in Los Angeles thought it was particularly racist compared to most of the US... but Hawaii is apparently way, WAY more comfortable in that regard.

My impulse used to be to placate and doormat, not make waves, but at my new job I've been more assertive. It's scary sometimes. Fun, and empowering, but scary. It's easy to imagine ""assertive"" getting misinterpreted as ""aggressive"" or the dreaded ""B"" label, and that getting parlayed into ""she's a poor culture fit,""  or, ""she's a bad collaborator."" From what this author said, it seems like concerns like these were amplified for her, which... Fuck, I don't know how you navigate that without second-guessing every impulse you have.   I'm still trying to figure out the right way to advocate for diversity at work in a way that resonates with the developer population. They're mostly white men who really want to believe it's a meritocracy, and they have trouble seeing the biases in the system of education, interviewing, hiring, etc. Most of them are good guys, and aren't overtly racist/sexist/homophobic, they just don't see their privilege and they don't always understand the collective impact of seemingly small jokes or actions. I dunno. I'm not sure where to start."
FemmeThoughts,2q5190,FlewPlaysGames,15,Tue Dec 23 03:45:42 2014 UTC,"I think it's difficult because these things take time. If we try to grow the community too fast, it could result in lots of poor content or lots of attention from the wrong kind of people.  I admit I don't really browse a lot of sites outside reddit, so I don't really come across new content that I want to share. However, I think I could try to be more active to I'll make a mental note to make an effort. Now that other ""women friendly"" subreddits are going downhill fast, I think there's definitely an opening for a place like FemmeThoughts.   This place will grow in popularity slowly, but I hope it never gets big enough that there's too much content to keep up with. We'd lose the sense of community if that happened."
FemmeThoughts,2q5190,Jovankat,7,Tue Dec 23 09:34:59 2014 UTC,I think it's difficult because these things take time.   I thought you were talking about how long it takes to read an article and then write thoughtful comment. My problem is I tend to save articles to read later and by the time I've read them it seems too late to comment or I've forgotten when I found them. A lot of the other subs I browse tend to be the sorts of places whee viewing and commenting on the content is quick and pretty straight forward. This material takes a bit more thought. I think that's why I'm less active here than I'd like.
FemmeThoughts,2q5190,keakealani,2,Tue Dec 23 12:16:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's big for me, too. Plus I tend not to want to comment unless I have something new to add - if I like an article it'll get an up vote but I'm not exactly going to post just to say ""yay, I agree"" on every thread.  Ultimately this is the problem with Internet communities generally. You can either have a lot of fast-moving content that is relatively thinking-light, or you can have slower and more selective content that is more thoughtful, but much less frequent. I'm not sure I've ever seen a community that overcomes that."
FemmeThoughts,2q5190,thesilvertongue,22,Tue Dec 23 18:05:29 2014 UTC,"I agree. I'm check reddit way to much and I love big subs because of all the new content. I'm more into commenting myself, but I should post more. 2x has good articles but lousy comments so I could steal stuff from there I suppose.   You can also make giant multis of little subs, it kind of acts like a big sub."

FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,hermithome,34,Mon Dec 22 18:11:32 2014 UTC,"See my comment here for the issue with TwoX's moderation.  The problem is that the mods of TwoX and TrollX heavily overlap and they have the same moderation policies and philosophy - basically, as little interference as possible. TrollX is a popular sub, and its growing. It frequently trends and hits /r/all and brings in more and more users from the general reddit population.  And you can see it start to effect the sub. Comments get shittier, which provokes more political memes (or at least the personal is political memes) hit and there's often a lot of backlash. Even more shitty comments, plus some contingent of users who blame the shit comments on the user's post being political. It gets to be a vicious cycle. You see TrollX hit /r/subredditdrama more and more frequently, often because someone says something mildly feminist, which sets off an MRA and then there's a whole giant shitty thread.  If used to be that those sorts of comments were hugely buried at the bottom of comment sections and just got laughs in response. More and more, they aren't being buried, and are generating responses. I've started to avoid commenting, because it just gets awful. I'll point out how someone is being super racist, and I get those ""your racist for noticing"" replies, and they get heavily upvoted, while I'm getting downvoted. Not that the karma matters, but it just shows that the people I'm making comments for are becoming a voting minority.  Voting problems are always the first indication of trouble, because the widest group of people votes. A much smaller group comments, and a still smaller group posts. Now if the mods had good enforcement, the voting wouldn't be an issue, because they could limit commenting and posting to the people the sub was intended for. That's what we do here. We occasionally get brigaded and everything gets downvoted - that is, our sub is outnumbered in terms of the voting population. But we heavily moderate, so we don't allow that shit into comments or posts.  TrollX has a hands off moderation policy, which means that the only way the community stays good is if the core of the community heavily outnumbers the shit posters. And that can go on for a long time - it did in TwoX. But the longer a community is around, and the more they grow, the harder it is to maintain that balance. And TrollX is on the precipice. They've mostly lost voting, and comments are starting to turn. It's only a matter of time before it's just another /r/AdviceAnimals type sub."
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,WillyRocketGiraffe,13,Mon Dec 22 18:57:49 2014 UTC,"What I have disliked about TrollX has not been the men as much as it's been the white-feminists.   But thank you for a great explanation. I'm going to think about this.  What do you mean by ""good enforcement""?"
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,hermithome,15,Mon Dec 22 19:34:16 2014 UTC,"What do you mean by ""good enforcement""?   Well, you can see in the comment I linked to the mod attitude that the 2x (and TrollX) mods have. They see moderators as a necessary evil. They believe that communities can and should self regulate. They believe that women and minorities should be nice, and that making waves is bad.  There are a lot of things that the mods could do. They could regularly ban and shadowban trolls. They could remove comments. They could leave warnings. They don't.  For example at /r/femmethoughts, we have much tighter rules. We remove comments that break the rules, we leave warnings, and we regularly ban and shadowban accounts. We use a bot to catch problem words and phrases, and to more carefully look at new accounts. We also flag certain threads so that every comment is reported. We also get lists of users who participate in hate subs and have the bot automatically catch and flag anything they post here."
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,electricalLouise,9,Mon Dec 22 22:47:31 2014 UTC,"The difference is we're not default, and that makes it so much better."
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,Sukebanga,13,Mon Dec 22 18:16:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah, not being default means that the main subscriber base isn't a minority. But as the sub gets more and more popular, and frequently hits /all and trends, there are more and more trolls. And the mods don't do anything, which means it's only a matter of time."

The men-centric angle seems to have insidiously taken over the sub. In the beginning, apologist or ignorant comments were downvoted and quickly deleted. I'm also so tired of having to describe WHAT feminism is or HOW something is misogynistic to men that demand to be ""educated"" only to quickly reject everything other redditors try to explain to them.  Sorry, kind of lost track in my argument, but my point is that I'm tired of not having a common ground of knowledge with the people who try to ""debate"" me."

FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,wildeaboutoscar,19,Tue Dec 23 03:58:11 2014 UTC,We could build a multireddit? It doesn't solve the splintering but at least it would aggregate the content for us average users.

FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,RaHxRaH,25,Mon Dec 22 16:49:06 2014 UTC,I was thinking the same thing!  I wonder how we could get most of the women still subscribed to dump it and come over here or to SRSWomen?  Maybe an announcement thread on TwoXX (although it is likely the MRA trolls would simply downvote a thread like that so it never makes it to the front page...)
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,picklesitter,36,Mon Dec 22 17:03:30 2014 UTC,"Sorry, but a mass unsub from TwoX wouldn't make a real statement, because the mods don't care. And even if you got every single original TwoX user to mass unsubscribe, it wouldn't be a drop in the bucket.   From our list of related subs:   Mods focus more on tone-policing then cleaning up mansplaining and trolling. They even have a ""no misandry"" policy, which dates back to 2010 (see snapshots for 18/02/2010 and 01/03/2010). The tagline for the community has been ""You are the community. You have all the power of the internet to mold it."" off and on for the past few years. That is, moderators take a hands-off approach. The power of the internet is the power only of the average user: a voice and a vote. In mid 2014, twox became a default subreddit, which has made things worse. (screenshot from redditmetrics)  In regard to the recent petition on blackladies that reddit do something about the huge racism problem they deal with, 2x did NOT sign the letter and said this to a reported when asked:   “Racism and bigotry are highly complex problems that cannot be solved with the signing of a letter, or a website policing its users, or giving the trolls a spotlight. We are patently disinterested,” subreddit co-founder HiFructoseCornFeces explained. “Growing up means realizing that combating evil does not mean spending all of your energy stamping out every last flicker of fuckery, but in issuing forth genuine goodness whole-heartedly and with resonance.”   link   This is not new. This is not an accident. This is not a result of ""going default"". This is the type of community that the moderators want.    The mods have made it very clear, from nearly the beginning what their attitude was with regards to moderation and safe communities. And the mods choose to make the sub a default, which overnight, meant that the original user base became a tiny minority on the sub. Even if you could get every ""real"" 2x user to walk out, it wouldn't make a numbers difference. And the mods wouldn't care.   Edit: in addition to the picture above, which shows the staggering change in subscription growth when 2x defaulted, here's the shot of total subscriber change. Pre-default it was at 168k. There are now 1.695 million subscribers. 168k is nothing. 2x now often gets that many subscribers in a month."
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,teabagcity,2,Mon Dec 22 17:49:11 2014 UTC,A user named HiFructoseCornFeces was being unreasonable? Shocker.
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,FlewPlaysGames,13,Mon Dec 22 17:56:52 2014 UTC,"Call me paranoid, but announcing it publically, along with pointing folks to another sub in somewhere as toxic as TwoX, could potentially lead to more undesirables flooding currently (safeish?) harbours.    I thought about that, too.  I hate to direct those idiots to decent subs so they get the chance to ruin them, too.  Plus I doubt that the TwoXX mods would even allow a thread like that?  I'm thinking they might even delete it.  I really don't understand what happened to those mods or what they are thinking by letting this toxicity happen.  I mean, haven't they figured out by now that the default thing was a mistake?"
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,wildeaboutoscar,12,Wed Dec 24 14:43:53 2014 UTC,"TwoX mods generally don't allow threads like that. They sometimes even go so far as to remove mentions of other women's subs in the comments.   As for the trolls ruining decent subs, it depends on the sub. Not all subs take the hands off approach TwoX does. We tightly moderate here, so you're welcome to advertise the sub (though a heads up to the mods would be nice, so we can batten down the hatches).  The TwoX mods are not new to reddit, and were well aware what doing default would do. As I've said elsewhere on this thread, it was a purposeful choice, not a mistake."
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,munkijuice,2,Mon Dec 22 17:52:26 2014 UTC,I fear the mods wouldn't take too kindly to it either. I imagine it would be up for less than an hour before it would be removed.  It depends on how it's worded though I guess.
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,Adahn5,16,Mon Dec 22 20:30:36 2014 UTC,"Yes! It's so obvious the mods are ignoring the actual community members and doing what they please, to the detriment of the sub. IIRC, they didn't even ask subscribers if they should become a default. I've seen some pretty ridiculous statements from them. Honestly, I didn't care for the sub even before it was a default, but it is a serious problem that the biggest women's sub on this site has been overrun by men. Something needs to be done."
FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,Adahn5,2,Mon Dec 22 21:44:50 2014 UTC,"they didn't even ask subscribers if they should become a default.   Not only that, every time the issue comes up they ignore it, even when the entire userbase agrees that being a default is a terrible idea."

FemmeThoughts,2q2rjd,Adahn5,37,Mon Dec 22 21:42:30 2014 UTC,"I and a few others had a similar issue with r/Socialism. Similar, but not exact, since MRAs do get heavily down-voted. But they do invade the sub every now and again, and subscribers often face much more subversive infiltration because often these MRAs are what we call 'Brocialists'. Essentially socialists who want a change from Capitalism, but attack, discredit, disregard, or ignore women's rights, race relations and LGBTQIA issues.   This is how we describe them. Transcript: Pencil drawing of four men and a banner reading: ""Not Our Comrades"" hiding their faces. Speech bubbles, from right to left read: ""I think she made the whole thing up"", ""She's just a crazy bitch"", ""Look SWEETIE"", ""Class should come first. The rest is just divisive"", ""It's not really as bad as you say it is.""  We call these people reductonists. They often times make the claim that to fight for equality for women, ethnic or sexual and gender minorities is ""playing identity politics"".  It's the reason why a handful of us left and created a new sub. A safe place to discuss socialism/anarchism/communism and relate it to current events, all the while keeping to social causes like feminism, internationalism, egalitarianism, multiculturalism, secularism, humanism and environmentalism.

The admin's decision to let Reddit be some sort of organic self-regulating community has made it a very attractive prospect for a lot of racists, misogynists, etc. Even the under-age creep shots subreddit existed for a long time, and was well known, until it got attention from mainstream press.  It's just so easy to create a disgusting subreddit, ban anyone who dares question it, and it becomes a haven for angry people who love to bully and hate.   I'm happier on reddit now that I stay away from a lot of the defaults. There's some subreddits I'll visit that still encourage discussion, some places still have informative posts, but I'm realistic now about how to read reddit.

The mods clearly aren't interested in banning or engaging trolls, which...okay, whatever, that's their call, but if they're more focused on just enforcing the rules on the sidebar instead, they still fail because so many users break those rules with abandon and don't get their posts deleted over it. From what I can tell, so long as a slur isn't used, or a post isn't extremely misogynistic, it won't get wiped.  So it would be nice to weed out the creeps and ban, but I don't think such hopes are realistic. :("

If you tell him the hugs make you uncomfortable and he accuses you of reading too much into it, say something like, ""oh, I'm glad our relationship is merely a professional one"".

You may wish to address this directly with him, go to his superior, or you are justified in going directly to the HR department - which I would suggest. There are specific and plain corporate policies laid out for most businesses to avoid this kind of thing. Being a male dominated field does not justify anyone making you feel uncomfortable for inappropriate touching. This creates an adverse working environment and you're likely NOT the first or the last person he's crossed this line with.   You can start easy and tell him you're uncomfortable with his level of familiarity but DO NOT allow this to continue. He is an adult and knows what he is doing is NOT acceptable nor benign.

FemmeThoughts,2q2owk,Adahn5,6,Mon Dec 22 15:23:00 2014 UTC,"Transcript: Article from The Atlantic. ""The Private Lives of Public Bathrooms"" by Julie Beck, written April 16th 2014.  There are three pictures in this article:  The first picture is of a closed bathroom stall next to another with an open door.  The second picture is one of a transparent, see-through out house set up in the middle of a town square, the concept of which is that one can be seen doing ones' business.  The third picture is a side-by-side pannel of three public bathroom urinals. The first pannel shows urinals separated by tiled wall dividers, the second shows urinals separated by a smaller, plywood dividers, the third shows two urinals with no divider to separate them. The notion here is that the first is preferable, the second is acceptable, and the third is neither.    I found this article particularly interesting because of this comment:   The theory Moore lays out is that, in public, the gender hierarchy makes women the ones who are watched (under the “male gaze,” as it were). But in the bathroom, sans women, men worry about being the object of another man’s gaze, a feeling they don’t often confront in other places. This can make them fearful, even if there’s no real threat present.   Men often fail to acknowledge the existence of the 'male gaze' when women feel legitimately fearful. Yet when there are no women present, men themselves feel under similar threat and acknowledge it's there."

The song is about all the privileges white men have, versus the societal expectations of women and racism that everyone else faces, ie ""I never wake up and have to cake on ma make up Or straighten hair, I ain't given a damn I'm wearing whatever I wanna in this muthafucka"" The point isn't that women are ridiculous for doing these things, its not ""women are silly"" its ""if I were a woman I would also be expected to do these things, I'm glad as a man that is not the case""  or ""And when I'm freaking, I'm getting daps, high fives, and all that Ma rep goin up, and at best, ho a slut"" Here he's talking about how when men sleep around they get praise and women get called a slut, and he's pointing out how ridiculous it is and how hard it is for women. or  ""And I ain't gotta speak to ma mother...to still love her"" Of course women don't have to call their mothers to still love them, no one believes that, it's just pointing out how ridiculous these beliefs are.  Is the song problematic? Certain lines yes. But so is ""She says, ""Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"" in All About That Bass, all of Jealous, really almost any song in the top 100. ""White Dude"" has issues but on the whole I think it's far more progressive than most popular music, you see very few artists willing to recognize privilege."

I always like to use the comparison of the infamous Michael Richards rant vs. Louis CK's ""Offended by the N-Word"" bit. Both are white guys saying ""nigger"", but one's offensive and the other's not. I would say that Lil Dicky is no Louis CK, but he's not nearly as bad as Michael Richards on a bad night."

FemmeThoughts,2pr7dj,AddictivePotential,3,Fri Dec 19 14:06:08 2014 UTC,"rant: I went on a nice date with a guy. We got back to my place and it turns out I don't have my keys. And my phone is dead. I get upset and stressed. Having someone else with me is just making it worse, because not only did I do something stupid to myself, I'm now feel like I'm making this guys night really stressful.   So it's an apartment building. We get in, I'm by my door, I know my roomie will be home later that night. I say something about him leaving because really, I want to be alone. I want to sit down and be grumpy by myself. Every minute he's there, he's seeing more and more of the depressed/anxious/freak-out side of me. I just want to be alone.   So there's no problem, he leaves. 30min later a lady lets me use her phone and she also has the apartment maintenance number, which I had NO IDEA existed, OR that they would even answer at 9:30 on a saturday. Everything turns out okay and I'm in by 11pm. I finally get to charge my phone, and I text him that everything is okay.  short summary of conversation:  Him: Glad you got in! I'm really sorry for leaving.  Me: No, don't be like that! I told you to leave.  Him: No but I should have waited longer, I'm sorry.  Me: Seriously, it was better that you left.  Him: I should have stayed with you.  Me: (now annoyed) I told you multiple times to leave.  Him: But I still should have stayed.  Me: (I give up at this point) Alright. If you think you should have stayed then I can't change that.  It's just like....it's so stupid. If he had insisted on staying with me I would have gotten pissed because he's refusing to comply with MY choice, which is for him to go home because I'm acting like a drama queen and just NEED TO BE FUCKING ALONE. I don't need some dude to be all chivalrous and stand by my side until I'm saved. And I especially don't need someone who contradicts what I want for myself because they have it in their head that it's the ""right"" thing to do.   And when I explained to him how I got in, he was like ""yeah that's what I asked! [about maintenance, earlier before leaving]"". Like yeah you did fucking ask that. And at that point I had no clue. Did you want me to give you the right answer before I knew it?  Overall the more time I spend with him the more I get annoyed by him. He drives too slow. Like REALLY slow. And he doesn't seem to get my awkward/sassy/weird sense of humor. My friends and I can talk back and forth for hours just being sarcastic and dumb. He just tries to avoid it like he's thinking ""um. is she joking? that's weird. what do i say?""  At this point I think our personalities are too different and I just wanna fade away.   Alright, end rant! Thanks for the soapbox, girls."
FemmeThoughts,2pnvft,zzaammzzaamm,64,Thu Dec 18 07:12:35 2014 UTC,"First of all, I'm really, really sorry this happened to you. You needn't think you were sexually assaulted, you were sexually assaulted - you told him no multiple times, he continued making sexual contact. There is a difficulty in these situations where some people may think, ""ok, but if you didn't want it, why didn't you say no more firmly, or just leave"", and I think this might be what you are thinking to yourself. The problem is, victims of sexual assault like yourself rarely tend to act the way we might expect, for a variety of reasons - our expectations of how victims should act does not usually tally with how they do act. Your actions are not to blame for this happening, and please don't try to use hindsight to put any of the blame on yourself. The blame lies entirely with Zeke here. You told him no, he chose to ignore that. What happened is his fault, not yours.  Zeke is clearly a sexual predator. He has a pattern; it isn't just you that he has done this to, but to your coworker as well. I wouldn't be surprised if he has done this to other women, as well. Whether you want to file a police report is entirely up to you; you may be concerned that you don't have any ""proof"" (although if he sent you IMs apologising, then that is pretty good evidence if you still have those), but you can still make a report. That way there will be an official note of it, and given that he is a predator, if someone else comes forward, there will be corroboration. However, I completely understand that it's a hard decision, and you may not want to. That's ok, too. But, I would say that whatever you do, you need to completely cut ties with the guy. Don't see him socially, and make it clear to him that you will not interact with him at work unless it is for a professional reason. You may wish to let your HR dept. know about what happened; again, that is entirely your call. But do not let this guy stay part of your life, he is a predator.  As far as your boyfriend goes, that is really tricky, and it won't be an easy conversation to have. I would suggest telling him, but before you do, prepare what you want to say - maybe have it written down. You did not cheat on him, you were sexually assaulted. Hopefully he will see that, and will give you the support that you need. You might also want to see a counsellor; it sounds from your post like this was a very traumatic experience and there is absolutely no shame getting some help in dealing with the feelings that it has caused.  Again, I'm really, really sorry this happened to you. Stay away from Zeke, and I hope your boyfriend gives you the support you need."
FemmeThoughts,2pnvft,Fairleee,2,Thu Dec 18 09:05:19 2014 UTC,"Thank you, really. Making an official report to the police did occur to me, but as you said, I have no ""proof"", and I don't know what the process involves but I really, really do not want to be grilled about it or laughed out of the building over something that an outsider could brush off as a drunken misunderstanding.   The IMs he sent were apologetic but vague (which is good, because I wouldn't want him spilling it on the work IM system, god knows who has access to those logs). I'm also semi-afraid of cutting him off outright, simply because I don't know how he will react. But I have been actively avoiding him, ignoring his IMs, and the couple times he has come to my desk I've said 'Bad timing, have to go pee'... clearly my go-to phrase for avoiding weird situations.  Also, I did warn some of my close friends at work about what happened, and cautioned them to avoid him if they ever attend a party he's at. And a few months back he applied to move to one of the other offices in a different state so I really hope that goes through and the problem just solves itself."
FemmeThoughts,2pnvft,Fairleee,2,Fri Dec 19 08:53:55 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I appreciate how you feel about the police report. I would say, don't rule it out for now; it might be worth looking for a subreddit here where you could ask for some advice on the process (I don't know one to recommend personally, can anyone help out?) and what is involved, so you can make a more informed decision. Even if the IMs are vague, they do at least give you support - he'd done something he felt the need to apologise for, and if there are any details to support your story (such as him mentioning a time, or a place, or being drunk), then that makes your story all the stronger.  As far as Zeke goes, I completely get that you're concerned about how he would react, so if you don't feel comfortable telling him to leave you alone, then I guess avoidance is your best tactic for now, although given that he's a predator there is a risk that he won't take the hint, and will continue trying to make contact with you regardless of how much you brush him off. If you do have an understanding manager, it might be worth just telling them that you have had a bit of a problem with Zeke, and ask if they can try and split your workload as much as possible, just to limit the amount of opportunities he would have to interact with you, but I understand if that isn't doable. And yes, warning friends does make sense - unfortunately, these informal warning systems are necessary. I hope things do resolve themselves and he does transfer away, but until that happens, look after yourself, and make sure you're not left alone with him at any point."
FemmeThoughts,2pnvft,so_srs,22,Fri Dec 19 09:48:31 2014 UTC,"I'll keep it short: that guy is a predator and a rapist. He knew exactly what he was doing, and he didn't care what you thought about it. His only two concerns were: getting you to allow him to assault you; shaming you enough that you wouldn't tell people what he did. He sounds like the missing stair of your social group. I'll bet anything you and your coworker/friend are not his only victims, and won't be his last."
FemmeThoughts,2pnvft,jillah92,22,Thu Dec 18 16:14:29 2014 UTC,"It's really difficult when this happens with someone you thought was a friend. Someone you trusted. But its okay, its not your fault, you did nothing wrong. You were scared but still told him ""no"", your friend ""gave in"" - she didn't want it either.   Not all assaults are violent attacks by strangers - the kind that gets talked about, the reason why you dont walk at night alone. People rarely say what to do when you're in a confined space with someone you thought you knew. You did NOT cheat on your boyfriend, you were groped and molested. Zeke did not listen to ""no means no"", and your boyfriend should understand that.   I do think that you should tell your boyfriend, and share the turmoil you're going through, he should be supportive and understanding.   I know that since Zeke is a colleague, you likely won't want to pursue arrest or anything to cause more ""drama"", but it might be worth ringing the police and asking them to make a report - if Zeke continues this behaviour, there will be a record that he's done similar before, and could help a girl in the future.   I know you feel weak, but dont, he is a predator and you should never have been made to feel that uncomfortable.   I would ask him to stop coming to you at work unless its completely necessary. I dont know how your office is, but it might be worth asking a supervisor to separate your work loads as much as possible. You dont need to tell them why if you dont want to - ""he makes me uncomfortable"" is enough, or even ""personal reasons"".   You did not cheat on your boyfriend. You were assaulted, you should not feel guilty about it.   I've been through similar in the past, with someone I thought was my friend, I gave up on my degree so that he could continue his - because ""why should he be punished for just being horny?"". Ugh, don't feel you need to hide or run away like I did, this guy clearly has a pattern, it wasnt just a one time thing, he will do it again. You did nothing wrong.   If you ever need to talk, send me a PM. I hope you feel better soon x"
FemmeThoughts,2pnvft,eliasv,16,Thu Dec 18 12:48:56 2014 UTC,"I feel like a fucking idiot.   For trusting a friend? Nonsense. And hell, even if it was a little naive of you - which I don't think it was - being too nice to entertain the possibility that someone who called themselves a friend would sexually assault you is the sort of 'stupid' I can get behind and respect. You don't have anything to be ashamed of.   I never, ever wanted to cheat on my boyfriend.   Good job you didn't, then! Cheating is something you do, this is something you had done to you. You did not actively participate in this.   I was dumb enough to think I could platonically share a bed with someone I considered a friend and they wouldn't touch me because they knew I had a boyfriend.   Fuck this most of all. Because you have a boyfriend? How about because you repeatedly said no? It's fucked up that women can't expect guys to have enough respect for their agency that they will accept no for an answer without another man having laid claim to them. Don't buy into this buckshot, you said no, that should always be enough.  Maybe you would have made some better decisions to protect yourself if you were sober, but so what? You haven't done anything immoral by being ill-equipped to defend yourself against sexual assault, the only person hurt by this is you, and the only person ultimately responsible for forcing themselves on you against your wishes is your 'friend', end of story.  Your boyfriend has nothing to be jealous of, and no reason to be mad at you. If I were you I would tell him, because you deserve his support. And don't you dare apologise. If he doesn't support you, then fuck him too. Good luck, stay strong <3"
FemmeThoughts,2pnvft,SisterOfRistar,13,Thu Dec 18 18:35:16 2014 UTC,"Please don't let that man get into your head - you in no way cheated. You told him to stop, you didn't initiate anything and you didn't kiss or touch him back. He only said you were cheating anyway to try to get you to have sex with him and to justify his actions. He was in the wrong, he sexually assualted you. Just because you didn't leave the room doesn't mean you cheated.  I would tell your boyfriend, but dont say you cheated because you didn't. Say you were sexually assaulted. And talk to someone at work about this, maybe the guy can be reported for sexual harassment and kept away from you.   I am so sorry you had to go through this. I wish I could take the guilt away as you have NOTHING to feel guilty about at all."
FemmeThoughts,2pnvft,MarthaGail,9,Thu Dec 18 16:15:00 2014 UTC,"Oh, he's creepy as fuck. How sad for him if the only way he can get a woman to have contact with him is to just pester and pester her.  /u/jillah92 and /u/Fairleee I think have both covered my thoughts pretty well. It's not your fault, he's disgusting and a predator. In this case, I doubt anything good for you would come out of reporting him at work. I don't know where you work, but if it's some kind of retail place, they probably don't care what you all do outside of work and would most likely tell you that you shouldn't have been in that situation in the first place. I've found that businesses generally want nothing to do with your drama. They don't want a wrongful termination suit for firing someone and they don't want to take on any kind of liability about what you all do after hours. If you think you can't handle seeing him, I'd start looking for a new job. Don't quit before you've found one, and you might have to let your manager know you'd prefer to work in a different area than him.  I would also tell all my friends that run in the same group. If you guys have parties and he pulls this every time, you all need to be on the lookout for each other and ready to stop him if anyone sees him pulling this shit again. Don't be afraid to speak up!  As for your boyfriend, telling him might risk your relationship. If you feel like you need to be honest with him, then be prepared for the possibility that he won't take it well. Honestly, though, if he's anything other than supportive and empathetic, he's not worth your time and you just saved yourself from ending up with an asshole. I'd explain it just the way you did here. You thought you had a room to yourself, you were way too intoxicated and he took advantage of that situation.   Good luck and stay strong! We're here for you if you need to talk it out more!"

A guy did a really similar thing to me a couple of years ago. In terms of explaining how it was assault, I was too drunk to stand and vomiting. What he did was wrong and sexual assault, but it might be hard to convey that to your boyfriend. Your co-worker's story shows that he's using alcohol to prey on women. I would suggest leading with her experiences, if you decide to explain to your boyfriend."

FemmeThoughts,2pnvft,hedgebop,3,Fri Dec 19 05:15:59 2014 UTC,"You said no several times. I'm sorry, but that guy is not your friend. He should have firstly respected your space and not got into bed with you, or he should have kept his hands off you. This is all his fault, not yours. He would have known you were drunk and has taken advantage of that. Ok, he tried it on once, but you said no (good for you) so he should have backed off then. You were far from home and did the right thing not driving home. You are NOT weak. You did NOT cheat on your boyfriend. You were taken advantage of. Do you have anyone you can talk about this to? Friend, family? Counselor? I would consider keeping as much distance between you and this guy, just professional relationship. If you feel you can not say this to him yourself, you may be best to speak to HR or an understanding boss?? There are no guarantees that he will not try it again, so if you see him out socially, keep your distance if you can. I am so sorry this has happened to you.  I really don't have advice on speaking to your boyfriend, but if you do speak to him make sure you emphasise how you were taken advantage of and are looking for his support. That to me would be the main reason to discuss, for support, not that you need to admit anything. You were not in the wrong."
FemmeThoughts,2pnvft,SquareIsTopOfCool,3,Fri Dec 19 00:15:46 2014 UTC,"What happened was not your fault.  You were sexually assaulted.  So was your friend.  I feel like I can't really give you good advice about this because what happened to me was so similar.  Others have been much more articulate.  I didn't seek help for a long time, and it damaged my life in a lot of ways.  I finally ended up going to the sexual assault crisis center at a local YWCA nearly 8 years after I was raped.  That sort of ""broke the dam"" and I got into therapy.  I can tell you these things: it's not your fault, you're not a cheater, you're not damaged or broken, and you're not alone.  Filing a police report is your choice, and if you decide not to (as I didn't), it doesn't make what happened to you okay.  And therapy helps."

And I raised them in the rural midwest. We have had our share of controversy and education regarding racial issues. I've noticed when speaking to some POC on the east coast, that we seem to be speaking across each other, or in different languages. Our experiences are too different for us to find common ground in our experiences. We just have to agree that we each have experiences that have formed our opinions.  I will go on about my life being an ally the best way I know how, informed by my now young adult biracial children. It's impossible to go through life without offending anyone.   But I get the point about making it ""all about me!"" I was discussing racial issues with my uncle-in-law at Thanksgiving and the first words out of his mouth were ""But I'm not racist!"" as if that somehow negates the cultural racism POC experience everyday. Your racism, or lack thereof, does not affect the vast majority (or any really) POC."

Racism is fucking hard to take, and yeah, a lot of people don't believe themselves racist, and are, and at any rate I don't deserve a medal for thinking POC are people.   Facebook ""Like this post if you support me in not being racist!"" is taking a really painful tragic thing and making it about personal approval.

That's part of the problem, good white people saying ""I'm not the problem"" but not doing anything to solve the problem either.  You can listen. You can learn. You can teach other people. You can be aware of everyday discrimination and microaggressions and fight against those. Both in terms of constantly being aware and fighting your own bad instincts, and in terms of letting other people know when there's an issue.   Sometimes the best thing that good white people can do is police other white people. The ""good white person"" who derails or doesn't listen - stop them. Telling other white people to shut up and listen to POCs is pretty huge, and you can get through to people that POCs can't. There are people who mean well who are fucking up who will listen to you when they won't to a POC. Use that to elevate the voices of POCs and get other white people to sit down, shut up and listen.   You can show up at protests. You can stay aware of important issues to the black community - maybe issues that don't affect you so much, and make those issues something you care about and bring attention to. There's LOADS you can do."

Why is it her responsibility to deal with? Isn't it enough to deal with being attacked as a POC, without having to also tend to all the issues white folks have with each other's racism and guilt and etc?   Telling white folks to listen, however badly I phrased it, that was my gist. I promise."

FemmeThoughts,2pmf3i,Rhathel,12,Fri Dec 19 07:09:58 2014 UTC,"An important article, for sure, but it seemed a little all over the place. She makes a couple different points, such as white people using liberalism as a way of self-actualization, not to benefit black people, then white people not understanding the social dimensions of race, and then white people who kill black people or forgive/support others for doing so.  One problem I see with this is that the ""white people"" are actually different groups- the white people killing black people and the white people self-aggrandizing by refuting racism are, by her definition, both ""good white people""- but they are different sorts of ""well meaning.""  Both devalue black life while trying to be good, but to treat the two groups as the same when they are acting on different sorts of racially based assumptions seems counter-productive."
FemmeThoughts,2pmf3i,kateh01,18,Wed Dec 17 23:25:17 2014 UTC,"Both devalue black life while trying to be good, but to treat the two groups as the same when they are acting on different sorts of racially based assumptions seems counter-productive.    But the author isn't. She's speaking from a very personal place about impact on her, and the black community. Also, I think you're probably wrong with regard to your assumption that these groups are so different. I think the more you read about the science of racism, the more it becomes apparent that racially biased assumptions are at the root of a lot of this behaviour."
FemmeThoughts,2pmf3i,Rhathel,17,Thu Dec 18 01:53:24 2014 UTC,"My thoughts on this really reflect the first comments from the article.  What are ""good white people"" supposed to do? Stand back and do nothing for fear of making it worse? Would doing nothing let the bad guys win?  And then it devolves into people stating they are tired of explaining what to do right and ""good white people"" should do what comes naturally in their heart.  Is that not the initial problem? ""Good white people"" doing what they believe helps. But in reality is offensive on a lower level. Very mixed, slightly offensive, message for white skinned people.  To me this very much seems like a having your cake and eating it too situation but I would like to hear from others so I can get a better understanding."
FemmeThoughts,2pmf3i,thewhaler,25,Thu Dec 18 02:26:14 2014 UTC,"I can't speak for all of the minority community here, but my suggestion would be to keep helping by listening. Listen to situations from POC's and let others hear those same situations. One of my closest friends is white and told me while we were discussing this same thing (paraphrasing here):  ""I know that this issue isn't really about me, so all I can do to help is listen and let others be heard. No one needs to hear my perspective or voice on this since it isn't affecting me, but they do need to hear the perspective of POC's and understand what they are going through.""  After listening it is about making sure the message keeps being heard, and staying educated on it instead of calling attention to your experiences. I think what the author means by ""good white people"" is the people that do things against racism and are allies, and are very proud of this and display it in their actions by calling some sort of attention to themselves. They think ""I'm good and I'm doing well! I am a good person for participating in X rally. I'm different from the racist people!"" when this isn't something that should be impressive or out of the ordinary. Does this make sense? I might be off, though. Hope this helps or at least points you in the right direction?  The type of help might also change depending on the situation I think.  EDIT: This article in the same website kind of explains it a little better. I read it a while ago, so I don't remember if there are any conflicting points or things of the such. Any questions just ask!"

FemmeThoughts,2pmf3i,chinese_drugs,3,Thu Dec 18 14:30:52 2014 UTC,"Glad I could help! I have a hard time with this too since I am a biracial Hispanic, but since my siblings have more predominant African features I get to see first hand what many of the people crying out mean (I look somewhat race ambiguous so I haven't had the same kind of experiences as my siblings).  I'm very opinionated and these current situations have taught me to listen closely instead of trying to think of how I've been affected. I want to listen to what my siblings have experience and I want others to hear their stories, because that's the only way to understand what is going on. I have white friends who feel uncomfortable when situations like this arise since they don't know how they should feel/act or what to say to me, so I try to just tell them about my siblings so that they have a way to connect with it in a more comfortable setting. I let them know that they don't have to try and justify anything or ""dig deep into their whiteness"" (weird phrase), and instead they just need to listen and try to feel what others feel. That's all.  I'm really glad you took the time to read through the article and my lengthy comment! :)"

I mean, on any forum related to health (general fitness, weightloss, dieting, etc.) they always remind female posters to remember that their period will effect things. Your weight will fluctuate, you'll retain more/less water, you'll probably crave different things, like just everything. It just makes sense to track your period along with everything else. Especially if it was programmed into it. You could see things like ""oh, your weight fluctuates when you ovulate"" rather than ""your weight happens to randomly fluctuate like every 30 days!"" I dunno, it just makes sense."

I have yet to find one that isn't:    super femme and cis all about babies and pregnancy super hetero and assumes you are in a relationship assumes periods are extremely regular   The one I've currently settled on gives daily health tips such as, ""treat yourself to a pedicure"" ""go shoe shopping"" ""watch a chick-flick"" ""eat cheesecake"" and regularly asks questions about ""your man"".  If I click that I've had sex on a certain date, it asks what form of birth control.  Only condoms, pills, and other are options.  Since I'm having gay sex I said ""other"" and each time it chides me that I'm at risk for getting knocked up.    I also have very irregular periods (which is why my doc said I should track them with an app) and each time one is late it sends me a warning that I should take a pregnancy test, with a sort of congratulations feel."

It does assume you have regular periods to start with, but will adjust itself to what you record.   The only options under sex are protected or unprotected, high sex drive or withdrawal. Nothing about birth control, no shaming about anything.  The notification says ""Your next cycle is estimated to begin within 2 days."" That's it. The whole app is like that, dry and scientific JUST HOW I LIKE IT. And it looks slick and is responsive. And is free."

It has a bit of a learning curve but other than that, it's great! I used it as a fertility tracker (one that focuses on not getting pregnant) and lately just as a regular period calendar/symptom tracker.   The design is very clean, you can track a zillion of things with it and it has graphs and charts if you're into that kind of stuff. The only tips I ever get from it are on how to make sure I'm tracking and inputting data correctly, and the only notification it displays is the breast examination one. The only thing I wish it had is pill reminders (it has reminders, but they're tied to your cycle and mine is not completely regular despite the pill)."

And not in terms of birth-control.. always in terms of trying to get pregnant!  NOT what I care about at all.  I haven't tried the two mentioned in the article that were designed by women yet, though.  And it absolutely should be part of an overall health tracking app.  I don't need two separate apps, plus I'd like to see if/how other health data points affect the timing of my period.  Is that so hard to imagine?  Or think of as reasonable?  Sidenote:  All the talk about how so many apps and other tech stuff are created by men reminds me of what I thought when I heard about the new Apple tablet.  The iPad.

I had tried one of those male-created apps before, and it was only based on a 28 day cycle with no ability to restructure based on individual timing, and it made a huge deal out of ovulation day, and didn't tell me when my period was coming.

I've played guitar for more than a decade now. I still don't feel comfortable going to some music stores, even to buy strings, because the man working the counter straight-up can't believe that I'm buying strings for myself and not a boyfriend/brother/whatever. Fuck that. It's hard to find very many women musicians in death metal, and when you do, she's either a ""made-up whore"" or ""trying to be a man."" Both of which are bad apparently.   You bring up a really good point about WHY Nicki underwent surgery. I just wish more people would think about/acknowledge that women can apparently only be musicians if they're also ungodly pretty (and then of course, they get picked apart for ""trying to hard"" or whatever bullshit idiots come up with). And in the rare instance when a female musician isn't extremely beautiful, people will still comment on how average (or whatever) she looks. As a woman, your looks are always part of the equation, no matter what. No amount of talent or extremely average looks will get people to look at you as an actual human being and not just decoration.  /rant"

My excuse was that I was busy, but in reality, I'm just so fucking sick of the ""male guitarist"" scene. Honestly, guitarists can be a pretty childish bunch.

Only conventionally attractive women rappers have any semblance of staying power. Nicki is just working the system as much as possible, and it's hard to blame her for that, and for wanting to do what she can to get her material out there. Women have much higher standards than men in rap and hip hop, and it's unfair as hell, but I'm not about to blame anyone for working teir way through the system.   I don't like how women are torn apart over their appearances at all, though I do take umbrage to you asserting that plastic surgery is deforming one's body. That's the same sort of body policing, and I don't really see the point in taking that stand when it's just as shitty as people who criticize Nicki and other women in the scene for having had surgery, for not having had surgery, for having an ass, for having no ass, etc. etc. I mean, I don't like the fact that women are coerced toward getting plastic surgery in order to advance in the industry and halfway appease the culture, but I don't feel there's anything at all wrong or deforming about getting plastic surgery.  Just my 2 cents."

Women don't pick their outfits and wear makeup just to appease the male gaze. Why should we assume that someone that gets plastic surgery is just yielding to patriarchal sex pressure? Unless Minaj has said something on the subject, she's the only one that knows why she elected for surgery."
FemmeThoughts,2phxeg,RaHxRaH,11,Tue Dec 16 21:20:21 2014 UTC,"I totally agree with what you're saying. She's made a name for herself as a female rapper (how many else can you name?) yet people are criticizing her appearance. I don't understand how people are allowed to do this, yet no one does this for male artists in the same industry. I think people are so quick to judge appearance/objectify a woman's body just because that's what the media has ingrained in us.  Why can't women change their appearance however they please? I feel like this type of action just reinforces the idea that the female body is made for men... I love Nicki Minaj and focusing on her body instead of her talent is just a tool to undermine her success in a male-dominant industry. But it sucks because there's that catch-22 where she probably couldn't have been where she's at now without hypersexualization. I dunno though."
FemmeThoughts,2phxeg,RaHxRaH,16,Tue Dec 16 21:48:24 2014 UTC,"Erm....i think she's obtained popularity. I wouldn't confuse that with being taken seriously.  I think she has the chops and she shows it sometimes but for the most part, she's going for generic-pop-star more than serious rapper.   Nicki is taken seriously as a rapper. What she is doing now is prioritizing pop appeal over her reputation as a rapper.    You combine this with all the machismo, the rejection of any other form of hip hop as ""preachy"" or ""hipster"" or worse ""white (with some justice i suppose)"", and the sheer competitiveness of rap - and i don't know what you're expecting?   People don't call rap music that take on social issues preachy or white or hipster. They only do that if you're Macklemore. Rap fans will only say that when it's true. The problem is that often rappers who speak on these types of issues are pigeonholed into the label 'conscious'. But now there are rappers breaking out of that like Kendrick Lamar. People aren't rejecting social commentary. Listen to Keisha's Song or Crooked Smile. These same rappers still have issues with misogyny, though. I don't know, I think things can definitely take a turn for the better, but the issues in hip hop reflects the issues in society. It's harder to find hip hop without misogyny because it's so ingrained in society at large."
FemmeThoughts,2phxeg,unplural,15,Wed Dec 17 04:18:23 2014 UTC,"I think most people think she can rap. I don't think most people take her seriously.   Even though the skills are there, she contributes as much to ""hip hop"" as Pitbull or Iggy Azalea.     Nicki Minaj contributes to hip hop even by existing. If it wasn't for her, there wouldn't be any women in mainstream hip hop. You're talking about a woman the New York Times named the most influential female rapper of all time. A woman who often outshines other MCs on the tracks she's on, regardless of gender. She's been hot for years. You aren't giving her the credit she deserves here, IMO. What do you even consider contributing to hip hop?  Comparing her to Iggy and Pitbull just seems ignorant.  The problem isn't the way Nicki chooses to represent herself. It's the fact that she is the only representation, so she becomes the standard for other women. You know, I sometimes wish she would tone it down but I still admire how she has managed to hold her own, expand into other ventures, and be in control of her own body. Like it or not, she is an important figure in many women's life. She's a mogul, a style icon, a role model. She is savvy, intelligent, deliberate. She does what she wants, when she wants.    Or El-P before Run the Jewels was a thing, Or Brother Ali, or Atmosphere, or Aesop Rock, or Sage Francies and they do it even if you're a person of color and a rapper like MF Doom, Saul Williams, Lupe,  Grouch and Eligh, Bambu, Immortal Technique, etc.   Did people say that about El-P?? You know, I'm going to be honest. I'm not into Atmosphere and Aesop. Lupe is, in fact, preachy. I can't listen to Immortal Technique regularly. It has more to do with style than content. I love social commentary in the music I listen to, but not in the form of a lecture. Keep in mind that rappers like Schoolboy Q are also commentators, they just don't do it in every song. Big Krit, Killer Mike, J. Cole, Nicki, Jay Z, etc.    He's pretty much the ONLY exception in successful mainstream hip hop who doesn't get laughed off the map for it.  Pop culture wasn't this over the top with misogyny before hip hop existed. (now reality of daily life sure was more so though)   Hip hop exploded purely because of it's shock value - it existed way before shock defined it, but when record labels started to get wise, they pushed, signed and wanted shock b/c it sells and it works.   I don't think you can honestly blame hip hop for this. There are so many other factors. I think hip hop is really problematic, but it is singled out again and again."

FemmeThoughts,2pgmg5,miscreantpossum,14,Tue Dec 16 11:55:11 2014 UTC,"Honestly, it wasn't until I got ill that I truly realised how ableist it was to assume that disabled only meant that the person had no use of a limb or limb set or whatever. A lot of people, whom are disabled, can in fact use their limbs.   It wasn't until I got sick that I began to fear the bus and the reaction to my not giving up my seat at the front if an elderly person or pregnant individual came on the bus if the bus was full because standing would put me into so much pain and exhaustion. Just because I'm young and look like I could take it doesn't mean I don't feel 90 years old with bones about to shatter.   I wish this was a higher issue in terms of intersectional feminism as often people like me are left to wonder how we're actually viewed in society because our illnesses aren't in your face. And this is why I shared this article because ableism often affects those you don't even think of."

Fortunately I've had a great support group of friends and family, so that has helped, but I have avoided things like large social gatherings because I hate being asked why I'm so tired/sore even after a short time.   Another thing to mention is how a lot of people (mostly older folks for me) try to ""help.""  Oh you have a chronic pain condition?  Have you tried (insert something here)?  That worked for (distant relative/person on tv/etc).  Because ya know, I obviously have not exhausted every option already, right?"
FemmeThoughts,2pgmg5,goodoldfreda,7,Tue Dec 16 12:15:13 2014 UTC,"As a 16 year old who has chronic pain as a result of endometriosis, this really rings true for me. What I find one of the worst things about it is telling people that I can't do things - normal things that most teenagers would be fine doing. I can't run to catch the bus, I can't be helpful and carry more than one chair at a time, and I can't always do my homework on time. I feel like I'm letting people down, or that they're judging me for being lazy (it doesn't help that I used to not be very well organised before I got endo).  And then there are comments from people who don't mean any harm, but can really make me feel bad, like ""if you have to carry a hot water bottle around, then should you really be in school?"" Listen, teacher, if I missed school every day I have to take painkillers/use a hot water bottle, I would either be moved back down a year or attend to little they wouldn't bother calling out my name on the register.   Another thing is just how unaccommodating people can be - I go to a school which prides itself on its pastoral care . The help I got with my GCSEs was astonishingly bad in some areas. I had to drop a subject when I got behind on the coursework, and instead of the teacher helping me catch up, he instead threatened me with detention. I had another teacher telling me I had to complete some other coursework next year, which would involve me starting the coursework all over again. Yet another teacher, during a meeting we had arranged to help me work out which areas of work to focus on to catch up in, just talked endlessly to me about what I hadn't done, comparing my work to other students', and telling me that I would be lucky to get a B in it. I ended up getting an A*, actually, and I do have a lot to owe to a separate teacher (who had never taught me before) going over all of the poems that I had missed and helping me write notes for them. Another teacher, though he was really trying to help, missed appointments on multiple occasions.  The absolute worst thing about being ill all the time is just the number of people who don't believe you. When I first went to the doctor, she was all smiley and helpful when my mum was in the room - after she left, however, she did the condescending ""how are you doing?"" talk, whereupon she took it upon herself to comment on my social life ""do you have a boyfwend? How often do you meet up with your fwends?"", because she thought I was faking the pain that made me throw up to get some attention. All of the people in my year at school thought I had anxiety for some reason. The school nurse essentially refused to let me rest in the health centre based on the fact that the pain I was experiencing was different to what she had experienced, and forced me to go to lessons (in one case, I slogged up two flights of stairs (the sort of stairs where the steps are too close together, so they take way more effort to go up than they should) to go to a lesson, whereupon the teacher said ""gosh, you look really unwell, goodoldfreda, why don't you go back to the health centre?"". I even had my sister go and talk to the nurse myself, to try and convince her that the pain I was experiencing was real. No dice. I haven't been to see the nurse in over a year, but that doesn't mean it's any better.  Oh yeah, I also have to deal with all of the teachers thinking I have been magically cured after every holiday."

Anyways, transcript:  Image of a computer showing off a transcript of a series of messages on a dating site.   1: So I'm looking forward to meeting you this weekend!  2: Me too! Where should we meet?  1: Where do you live? I'll pick you up and we can go back to my place.  2: Actually, let's meet downtown. :) There's a bar I like on college street -- or is there somewhere you'd prefer to grab a drink or coffee?  1: It's no problem, I can pick you up and we can hang out at my house. I mix a mean martini.  2: I'd rather meet downtown in a bar or something. That would be a lot more comfortable for me on our first meeting.  1: ... wow, I think it's pretty messed up that you're by default assuming I'm a creepy rapist or something.   Shot of narrator sitting on a couch in front of a laptop.  Narrator: *sigh*  Sometimes, in my head, we have a conversation about this. It goes like this:  Narrator is speaking to another person.  Narrator: That's a really tone-deaf and unfortunate thing to say. One thing I have to think about, even though I'd rather not, even when I just want to have a date with someone who seems pretty cool, is risk.  The narrator is shown standing on the fulcrum of a balance. The left side says ""likelihood"", while the right side says ""severity"". Likelihood is higher up than severity.  Risk is an equation that we have to calculate all the time! Risk is balancing the likelihood that something will happen against the severity of consequences or outcomes if it does happen. Then you have to decide what your risk threshold is -- how risky something has to seem before it's not acceptable to you.  Here's an example risk calculation!  A man is shown looking at a group of quacking ducks. I'm going to name him George.  George: I'm going to wade through this group of angry ducks! What could possibly go wrong?  George is seen reasoning.  George: Well, they'll probably quack a lot and peck me.   (likelihood of something negative happening: HIGH)  George: But I'm not going to get anything more than some light peck-bruising on my shins.   (consequences: MILD)  HIGH LIKELIHOOD + MILD CONSEQUENCES =  George: Eh, why not?  George is seen after crossing through the ducks. The ducks are still quacking angrily.  George: Yep. That sure was a lot of pecking.  Narrator: Here are the elements of the date you just proposed:   A man who I don't know well Who now knows where I live Meeting alone in an isolated place away from other people To a space he knows and controls To have drinks that I will not be preparing and may not know the contents of In an area of town that may not be easy for me to leave   What is the likelihood that something bad will happen? Probably low! You will likely be a perfectly reasonable person.   But if you're not... the potential outcomes are bad to severe:   Having a creepy guy creep on me without easy options for me to end the date early... Harassment and stalking now that you know where I live... An escalated risk of violence or retaliation due to lack of public observation if I have to extract myself from unwanted advances... Sexual or physical assault...   Case study!  After being walked home on a first date:  Image of a phone screen showing text messages.    1: Hey, that was fun! Want to get together again on Friday? 2. Sorry, I have project work to do that night. Let's aim for Sunday.   Confrontation, with the narrator looking ""whut"" with her face.    1: ""Project work""? Who was that guy in your apartment all Friday evening then?   Narrator: In the unlikely event that you do assault me, here's what I would get when I try to speak up about it to authorities or others:   Why did you go home with him?  Did you watch him make the drinks or did you just take whatever he gave you?  That's what you get for meeting strangers from the Internet.  He brought you to his house. What did you expect?  It's just you word against his.   Narrator: So you're (insistently) asking me to meet under circumstances that post increased risk.  Even though the likelihood of you harming me is low, the consequences of the possibly that you will are significant...  Narrator is now standing alone with other people yelling at her.  ... and the social and legal support that I would attempt to address those consequences are diminished and compromised because of judgment around my decision to meet you despite the risks.   WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO  WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST  WHY WOULD YOU  WHY WOULDN'T YOU   Narrator: It's important to remember that society very often places the responsibility for preventing harassment, stalking, assault and abuse on women, femmefolk, and other groups who are likely to experience sexual/intimate violence or assault.  Image of a two women speaking separately    We're expected to preform risk calculations comprehensively and accurately all the time, and we're expected to always choose correctly and prudently. We are expected to constantly and correctly take actions to reduce the likelihood that we may be harmed by others and reduce the severity of harm we endure.    Image of people shouting typical ""how to not get raped advice"".   Don't walk home alone.  Don't let strangers walk you home.  Carry pepper spray.  You made him mad by fighting back.  Why didn't you fight back harder?  Don't act confrontational.  Don't act like a pushover.  Don't draw attention to yourself.  Dress appropriately.  You should have let him down easier.   Narrator: When we ""fail"" to successfully do all of the things we're supposed to and get harmed, we're very likely to hear...   Well, you were asking for it...   Narrator: But we don't get this kind of reaction in other circumstances!  Driving is pretty risky! It's totally possible every time you drive that you may be involved in a collision or accident, which can range from minor car damage to multiple deaths. We all know someone who has been involved in a moderate or serious car accident.  Man stands in front of car.  Man: It's absolutely possible that I will be hit by someone who is driving recklessly. But that's a risk many of us accept every day, and I'm unlikely to have to shoulder a lot of responsibility and blame for that accident.  Narrator: How come I have to shoulder the responsibility and blame when somebody rapes me? If it's okay for me to accept the risk of being on the road during a rainstorm, why isn't it okay for me to accept the risk of going on a date with a stranger? *SIGH*  My need for an environment and context in meeting you that feels safer for me is not a reflection of you on a person but is based on my actual, lived experiences of evaluating risk and experiencing unsafe situations, and a constant awareness of a social support structure that will blame me for allowing myself to become the victim of a crime. So I'd very much prefer to meet in a space that is accessible and comfortable for both of us and I'd be happy to negotiate a meeting space that tries to meet both our wishes.  That's the conversation I think about having.  ... but it's not actually my job to fucking educate you. You're already being an asshole about this.  So never mind.  Back to the dating inbox conversation from the first and second panels.   1: ... wow, I think it's pretty messed up that you're by default assuming I'm a creepy rapist or something.  2: Yeah, you're right. Let's not bother.   - end -"

But if we (I) don't take the initiative, then who will? Is it a case by case situation? Like i could understand why a guy wouldn't understand a woman's choice in this context, shouldn't we (I) take the initiative to teach him why we would be hesitant in a situation like this?  I've encountered guys who have said very ignorant offensive things about women before. Being outspoken and confrontational, i tend to correct them and tell them why they might be wrong. Some are appreciative of seeing things from a different viewpoint while others just roll their eyes. I use this as a pretty good barometer of who i want in my life."

That doesn't really happen a whole lot, though. :/  I'm always happy to give a cursory explanation of what a concept is or why XYZ thing is offensive to me or whatever, but after awhile, it's almost exhausting. You wonder if they'd treat you with the same courtesy if you brought the conversation to a screeching halt just to go over basic terms and concepts.

I was told racism was over, or that it was a problem for ""racists"" and racists only to fix - some group that could be vaguely pointed at over there. They're the problem, not us normal folk. Not society as a whole. I've known this wasn't true for a while, obviously, but I've recently been trying explicitly to shift my language to reflect that. We are the problem. Not ""them"", some faceless group of racists who are racists and nothing else.   This feels at the same time utterly obvious and totally against the grain to say. I'm pretty new to the open discussion of racism, though, so maybe that's why it feels that way. I don't know. All I know is that I don't want to be part of the problem anymore."

FemmeThoughts,2pdgi3,DOTAVICE,1 point,Tue Dec 16 13:53:47 2014 UTC,"I always thought Mr. Freeman was talking more about perpetuating the idea that there are races rather than actually saying don't talk about actual racism that you see.  I'm not sure I still fully agree with that.  I think explaining what something is, and why it does or doesn't make sense is key to either making it stronger or weaker.  If we had people consistently articulating why race is an ineffective means of grouping people together, one that often has horrible consequences, rather than just labeling it as something of the past that we shouldn't talk about, I think it would actually serve to reduce racism overall.  I mean in terms of nearly every other ill/problem our society faces we always stress education as a source of prevention.  We haven't stopped talking about crack in schools hoping kids will never find out about it. And while both our legal system around drugs and drug education itself is horribly flawed, at least we haven't said ""just stop talking about it and it will go away.""  It just seems like a pretty naive argument to me.  Problems don't always need be met head on, ill give you that, but they should at least be recognized and discussed in order to determine the best solution."

FemmeThoughts,2p5a4b,keakealani,26,Sat Dec 13 06:01:13 2014 UTC,"I think (as a white woman) it's because most people who consider themselves feminists think of that first, and racial things second.  Which is bad in ways, because not examining the situation your life takes place in makes it easy to forget about how feminism for different groups is very different.  Which is a roundabout way of saying ""Check your privilege, and pay attention to intersectionality."" We don't like being reminded we are kinda as bad as the patriarchy, and just existing means we get more opportunities on an everyday level.  I've probably been guilty of prioritizing stuff that means more to me than stuff that is literal life or death for black folks, because it is hard to associate something you're doing right with something you're also doing wrong, if that makes sense.  I kinda hate saying this because I'm sure you're heard variations on this theme, but for any other white feminists reading this thread- we have it damn good and ignoring our sisters' struggles because we don't get it or think we know better is basically taking the white pill instead of the red one."

FemmeThoughts,2p5a4b,eucalyptusqueen,6,Sat Dec 13 14:08:35 2014 UTC,"I completely agree with your comment. I think there can be an issue for us white feminists, in our thought processes: ""feminism means recognising that there are systemic inequalities in the world. I am a feminist, therefore I recognise that these inequalities exist. Because I recognise that gender acts as a system of oppression, I understand that other issues, such as race, also act as systems of oppression, but because I am aware that these systems exist, my awareness means I do not participate in them.""  Of course, this isn't true (for example, we can still participate in and support the patriarchy despite being aware of it), but it is very comforting to convince ourselves that we cannot participate in systemic oppression of others simply by virtue of understanding the existence of that oppression. It reminds me of a blog post I read a little while ago which deconstructed an artefact of this oppression. It discussed an incident where a white person refused to acknowledge an issue of race, by using the excuse, ""oh, I guess I just don't see the world in that way"". For most white people, interactions with minorities are the exception, rather than the rule - most of our family, our friends, our coworkers, the people we see on TV and films etc., are white. Therefore, we don't have to see the world using race as a lens because we are so rarely in a situation where we would need to. We know that we aren't racist, therefore race just isn't an appropriate lens though which to examine our social reality. This of course ignores the fact that this is a massive privilege - being a majority means you can choose to ignore being part of the majority. Being a minority means not being able to ignore your minority status, because the reality of it surrounds you constantly.  So yeah, it can be hard to remember to check our privilege (and goodness knows I have more privilege than most), but it is so important to do so, and be reminded to do so."
FemmeThoughts,2p5a4b,Fairleee,13,Sat Dec 13 16:51:12 2014 UTC,"Lol, you would have not have believed how many white feminists were complaining about the #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen tag. They painted it as divisive and said it was important for women to stick together. Like, totally unironically."

FemmeThoughts,2p5a4b,keakealani,2,Sat Dec 13 17:00:43 2014 UTC,"My understanding from my reading on the subject is that it shouldn't be considered divisive because that unity wasn't ever there to begin with (i.e. issues that apply specifically to WoC were not part of the mainstream feminist agenda). Is that the idea? Please correct me if I've misunderstood.  Edit: to add my personal view, I absolutely respect the establishment of a WoC feminist movement, but I don't completely understand the need to disparage the established feminist agenda (other than in its double standards e.g. the beyonce as a feminist debate)"
FemmeThoughts,2p5a4b,adibidibadibi,8,Sat Dec 13 09:34:50 2014 UTC,"I suspect that the criticism was less about disparaging mainstream feminism and more of an appeal to include issues that are important to WoC (many of which are extremely important to feminism and women as a whole). Plus to point out the hypocrisy of speaking out against a sexist system of oppression but actively participating in a racist system of oppression (and yeah, I've seen some extremely racist shit in certain feminist circles).  But of course, sometimes these critiques can get pretty emotional and angry, which I suppose can come off like disparagement. But it's a short path to tone policing so I'm not going to go there."
FemmeThoughts,2p5a4b,keakealani,8,Sat Dec 13 17:05:58 2014 UTC,"I remember the first time someone called me a 'white feminist' and said that I wasn't sensitive to issues that WoC face, and my defenses flared.  at the time I was working at a domestic violence shelter where white residents were the minority, and I thought that I was doing a really good job at being 'colorblind' and treating all of my clients with the same level of respect.  I think I was complaining to a friend about how often I would get called 'white bitch' and 'racist', and I thought it was unfair.  feeling so defensive at that comment was a huge red flag for me, so I tried to simmer down and listen to what he had to say, and he was absolutely right on a lot of points.  I still struggle with actively acknowledging race issues in my personal definition of feminism because I no longer work at the shelter and live in a very white world right now, but I understand the privilege that I was born with being white.   by 'personal definition of feminism', I mean what I actively put out there on a daily basis- self-respect, avoiding names like 'bitch' or 'cunt', asking my male friends to not call other males 'pussy', etc.  most of my friends in the area I live in are white, although I do have one friend who is a WoC and feminist, and she challenges me on a lot of privilege, which I'm forever grateful for."

One white person's actions aren't seen as a reflection on all white people. Minorities don't have that luxury. That's why after 9/11, all ambiguously brown/Muslim/Arab people are terrorists, but no one pathologizes white male teenagers as school shooters."

I also disliked how she defined and framed feminism. I read all four parts, and the piece reads better once you've read the earlier parts, but it's still very dismissive. I also really disliked part 2, and her defence of trolls and harassment.  I also really disliked her writing. It's all over the place. There's no clear narrative or audience and she never really ties her thought processes together. A lot of the stories and anecdotes don't really tie in. She spends a lot of time talking about her personal life, but doesn't quite manage to tie it to larger ideas. In fact, she seems to use her personal experiences as a shield quite a bit. It's also just not very coherent. She has some strong ideas about the role of men in combating toxic masculinity and the role of new technologies, but she jumps around and rarely ties things together coherently."

I know women who have had abortions, and I've known women who gave up for adoption. There was WAY more regret from the second, because there is an actual living, breathing person entangled in the mess. I've known people who regretted the children they gave birth to, for all the lost opportunities they represented for the mother, and her (self-perceived) inadequacy as a parent when she wasn't ready.  I think the response above is brilliant, definitely. But there's so much MORE wrong with the statement that isn't addressed."

While abortion isn't really associated with depression, trauma or PTSD*, adoption DEFINITELY is. And there really isn't much support or resources for these women after they give birth and the child is adopted. And since adoption over abortion is seen as this beautiful thing, many struggle with their trauma and depression even more, since they are the ""wrong"" thing to be feeling.  * I'm not saying that these don't or can't happen, it's just that statistically speaking abortion isn't an outlier.

Do you mourn the egg you lose every month?   I'm not saying that this is the only/right way to see things, I'm just saying that taking it lightly does not necessarily make you a callous or forgetful woman, and taking it hard doesn't necessarily mean you're a weak sap.

Oh, found a reference:   In 1967, despite the optimistic tone of Cosmopolitan’s “Computer Girls” article, the programming profession was already becoming masculinized. Male computer programmers sought to increase the prestige of their field, through creating professional associations, through erecting educational requirements for programming careers, and through discouraging the hiring of women. Increasingly, computer industry ad campaigns linked women staffers to human error and inefficiency.  http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-%E2%80%9Ccomputer-geeks%E2%80%9D-replaced-%E2%80%9Ccomputergirls%E2%80%9D   Most programming is not very mathematical in nature. You can get by with counting and simple math, even today. But in the 1960's there were efforts to legitimize programming as a proper (read: masculine) career by connecting it with fields like mathematics - fields that women generally didn't have as much training in.

FemmeThoughts,2otj5s,looseleafliesoflow,20,Wed Dec 10 03:38:38 2014 UTC,"I went to a really interesting talk at a conference which looked at how women get into IT in the first place; what the researchers' found was that there was a dominant narrative for how men typically get into IT (getting a computer at an early age, joining a computer-based subculture like gaming, hacking and tinkering about to learn the basics of codes), but there was no dominant narrative for how women get into IT - many of the women would fall in and out of their relationship with IT at various points, due to a variety of reasons (lack of support at home or school, institutional sexism, internalised attitudes towards male and female aptitudes, family etc. etc.). The researchers argued that ultimately, pushing the dominant (and male) narrative that IT is something you have a lifelong passion for (because this is how so many men end up in the industry), is exclusionary to women - women don't have the same life course as men, and therefore there is a sense that IT isn't right for them. A possible solution to this is making more visible the various routes women take to get into IT, to provide role models and reassurance for women that even if their path varies, they still have the right to be in the industry.  Edit: I should point out of course that there are women in IT who had a more ""traditional"" route into IT - getting a computer at a young age, sparking a lifelong passion - but the researchers found this was the exception, rather than the rule."

It might also be beneficial for you to find jobs in a place that has a low pool of programmers. Not that you can't get a job in NYC or the bay area! I've just noticed that it was easier for me to find a job in Austin than the other cities where competition was crazy high.  If anyone disagrees with my advice or wants to correct me, please do. Like I said, I haven't been in your situation so my advice could be off."

I try to educate my colleagues about feminism as often as possible, but I've never been ""in"" with the startup community, where the problem seems to be the worst. It frustrates me so much to feel like there's nothing more I can do, though if I start going to conferences again, I have been strongly considering doing talks aimed specifically at this problem. The lack of empathy among the tech crowd can be truly shocking."

I was just trying to figure out who I could vent to about this discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8720064 (note: don't read if you want to keep your blood pressure down).   Basically a renowned physics professor had all his lectures taken down from MIT's free education site after he sexually harassed multiple female students. The early discussion mostly centered around how much of a travesty it was that they took his lectures down, women be damned, when the real travesty is the fact that all of it could have been avoided if the guy wasn't a giant creepy asshole."
FemmeThoughts,2otj5s,faitswulff,8,Wed Dec 10 08:07:17 2014 UTC,"Yikes, yeah. Anything having to do with women or race turns to shit on that site (though there are some guys that get it and fight back and I appreciate them), much less sexual assault. Most of the time sex/race stories get flagged off the front page (flagging is basically how you downvote), which the moderators really ought to put a stop to. The assholes flag them off the front page because they don't want to have to be aware that sexism/racism exists.  And these are your average tech workers. This is the tech industry. The attitudes even the ""HN famous"" users have expressed, ugh. I think it was cpercival that literally thinks men and women can't be friends."

I got into programming when I was in middle school, and I was encouraged every step of the way. I have literally lost count of how many women I've personally encountered who have dealt with sexist preconceptions creating hurdles at every turn.  A close friend of mine is painstakingly teaching herself programming, still living with her parents, but her Dad keeps purchasing her brother new computer parts because ""He's always in his room working on the computer! Why don't you spend as much time on it, if it's so important to you?"" ... Meanwhile, her brother is actually a video game addict, and she's stuck with a shitty 5-year-old hand-me-down laptop.  It's like the entire industry exists to gaslight enthusiastic women, but as a direct result of the men being delusional. ""What do you mean??? There's no bias. If you were really as devoted as you say you are, you'd realize there's no sexism.""  Fuuuu... sorry. I got kind of carried away there.  I hope you have found happiness in your next career step. Maybe us techbros will get our heads out of our asses and be ready to welcome you back someday."
FemmeThoughts,2otj5s,bombeater,3,Wed Dec 10 16:21:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks.  It's certainly not the only reason I changed career paths, but it wasn't insignificant either.

FemmeThoughts,2otj5s,moriarty_was_real,2,Thu Dec 11 00:42:50 2014 UTC,There's a surprising amount of opportunities for tech workers outside the industry (seems like everyone could use a programmer these days); I'm glad you found a niche out there somewhere!

The sexism starts early. Good thing I like being stubborn (though I did only get into computer science when I got to college)"
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,theperfectbanchee,54,Wed Dec 10 02:07:22 2014 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with you! I've had the same experiences. What sucks is when you think you're dating a nice, forward-thinking, feminist guy, and all of a sudden he's talking about how cat calling really isn't that bad, or how awesome PUA tactics are, or makes gross racist or homophobic jokes, or whatever. It's like a double slap in the face: who is this person, and how didn't I see it earlier?  Stick to your values, and set your own threshold of how flexible you are about this stuff. In the past, my threshold seemed to be about 3 or 4 hard conversations about sexism/racism/etc., and if those discussions go poorly, then I dump him because we have different foundational views of humanity and are incompatible. Your threshold might be different.   It does get better! I'm in my late 20s now, dating another late 20s guy for whom social justice is ingrained. It's simply part of who he is. When one of his friends says something sexist/racist/etc., my boyfriend is often the first one to call it out. Oh, and he's fine as hell. It's awesome. Hang in there, and keep those standards high. And maybe try to meet guys in other places like book clubs, volunteer work, etc."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,probabIy_drunk,10,Wed Dec 10 02:34:10 2014 UTC,hmm so maybe my problem is that I'm just not good at meeting like minded people ?
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,probabIy_drunk,22,Wed Dec 10 02:36:11 2014 UTC,"It's really, really hard to say, because there are so many ways to be like-minded (e.g., valuing physical fitness). And even if you meet a guy who does believe in gender equality, there's no guarantee that the relationship will work out, you know?  It's a numbers game. It comes down to just meeting a ton of people and meeting the right people and being selective. It can take a while and it sucks."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,myfavcolorispink,8,Wed Dec 10 02:40:42 2014 UTC,it does suck :(  so how do I go about meeting a ton of the right people?

What happened to you totally sucks, and I'm sorry but I don't have any advice on how to seek out and find like minded individuals. But you can screen out the ones that don't think feminism is important and can't empathize with the struggles we face fairly early on. You could be direct about it and ask ""what do you think of feminism?"" on a first date or go a more subtle route that will tease out his feelings on the matter. I hope you find someone that works for you and can empathize with you. Guys like that, even ones into fitness, really are out there."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,quickhorn,2,Wed Dec 10 03:03:54 2014 UTC,"you're right, thanks.  I'm not so much discouraged that I had to break up with him, I feel discouraged because it just feels like the kind of man I want just does not exist and it makes me sad.  So there ARE  men out there that are feminist? Or am I just looking for a unicorn that doesnt exist?"
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,bombeater,4,Wed Dec 10 22:52:04 2014 UTC,"They DO exist. I'm dating an athletic feminist guy (have been for three years -- we were good friends for five before that) and there are more like him. They're just hard to find because dudes have figured out that misognyny doesn't fly with a lot of us anymore, but many of them don't intrinsically understand the nature of privilege ... so, as a result, we get a lot of closeted misogynists. Often even closeted from THEMSELVES.  Also: if my partner is any example, the feminist ones also tend to be introverts. In order to meet dudes like him, you'd probably have to frequent bookstores, design meetups, board game nights, coffee shops, etc. They're out there!! Just hard to find."

This stuff matters to you, it's a deal breaker. So get it out there and make sure you don't waste more than one date on these dudes. Also, if you do online dating, put this stuff in your profile.   The idea that you don't talk politics or religion or stuff on first dates is ridiculous. If you have deal breakers, find that shit out fast."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,junesunflower,11,Wed Dec 10 02:37:12 2014 UTC,"This is a really, really good idea. In my troubled youth I actually started cohabiting with someone before I found out he was anti-abortion (it really came out of the blue and didn't match up with any of his other beliefs, but it was real).   Could have saved a lot of heartbreak if we'd only talked about that subject a lot sooner!"

FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,jolene_honeycutt,14,Wed Dec 10 12:24:14 2014 UTC,"If you think abortions should be free, safe and legal, it sounds like you are actually pro choice, not pro life. There's a reason it's called pro choice and not pro abortion :)"
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,happiersadist,3,Wed Dec 10 16:49:47 2014 UTC,"I suppose so, albeit with some reluctance. Just because I don't like something, doesn't mean it shouldn't exist or isn't necessary."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,hermithome,6,Thu Dec 11 10:08:05 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean to say to me here... are you saying that you, personally, identify as ""pro-life""? From what you have described of your beliefs, you could also be identified as ""pro-choice"".  Are you commenting to let me know that you don't like it that I described my ex as ""anti-abortion"" because you, yourself don't identify that way? I take your point, but please bear in mind that he himself told me that he was ""staunchly anti-abortion"", and he believed abortion should never happen, no matter what.  I have to admit, I find the opposition of ""pro-choice"" with ""pro-life"" a bit strange. The opposite of ""pro-choice"" is surely ""anti-choice"", while the opposite of ""pro-life"" must be ""anti-life"". For this reason, I find the euphemism ""pro-life"" a bit dodgy because it implies people who believe the opposite (eg that abortions should be free, safe, and legal) are ""anti-life"". That's why I wouldn't usually use that term."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,hermithome,3,Thu Dec 11 08:44:34 2014 UTC,"Ah, if he identified as 'anti-abortion', then by all means. The reason it bugged me was exactly because of people saying I'm anti-life, just because I recognize abortions can be a medical necessity."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,jolene_honeycutt,2,Thu Dec 11 10:02:44 2014 UTC,"That sounds quite frustrating for you, having people calling you that.

FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,happiersadist,5,Wed Dec 10 22:48:51 2014 UTC,"There are occasionally these posts in one of the SRS subreddits, where a woman is asking how to talk to her husband about feminism or racism.

FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,Craylee,3,Wed Dec 10 23:38:17 2014 UTC,"Yeah, honestly, maybe it's just because I've wasted a lot of time in bad relationships but I see no problem with a conversation like: ""I like you and would really like to see where this goes, but I have a few things I just want to get out in the open."" and go from there.   If the guy is offended by that, you just saved yourself some time."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,idiosyncrat,11,Thu Dec 11 02:17:34 2014 UTC,"They are out there, there's quite a few and I've noticed they tend to be friends with each other. For example, my whole friends group, girls and guys alike, are all feminists. The opposite is true too. You just have to figure out where they're hiding. This happened to me before, I had a crush on a guy a few years ago. I then overheard him talking to someone else about how ""anyone who calls themself an agnostic or atheist is stupid and has too much time on their hands to come up with a name for something they supposedly ""don't believe in."" Never talked to him again, didn't even know I overheard.   Better finding out early on rather than later!"
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,FixinThePlanet,12,Wed Dec 10 03:36:30 2014 UTC,"This is very true. If you make friends who are feminists, and who find feminism important in their lives, then the people you meet through them are more likely to be feminists.  I'm a part of a very feminist community. Everyone I've met in the community and through the community has been someone who takes equal rights and civil rights seriously. It's not an accident that I've met a tonne of LGBTQ activists, a bunch of labour activists, a lot of people working in interfaith groups, a bunch of civil rights activists. It's not an accident that the community is well gender balanced, and has lot of gay, transgender and black members."

FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,FixinThePlanet,5,Wed Dec 10 22:46:00 2014 UTC,"Get involved in activism. It'll do two things for you socially. One, it will introduce you to other people who care passionately enough about these issues to show up and make a difference. And two, it will change how you present yourself everyday. People talk about their lives, and what they do, and what they're interested in. If you're an activist, you'll be talking about this stuff day to day. It'll be in your updates on facebook or twitter and whatnot. And that means that people you know who care about this stuff will know they can approach you about this stuff. You'll change the dynamic."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,Leagle_Egal,2,Wed Dec 10 23:39:39 2014 UTC,"that's good advice, thank you.  I've been trying to figure out exactly how to do that - to be an activist.  I joined the communications committee for the local Women's Health Centre in my city -we meet once per month.  I should see if they maybe have other things I can participate in that are related to feminism or other human rights issues"
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,FixinThePlanet,3,Thu Dec 11 00:58:35 2014 UTC,"Absolutely! Also, see if their are other activist organisations that meet in the area. I mean, it depends where you live, but if you live in a good sized city, there's tonnes of stuff."

There is seriously nothing wrong with you. I couldn't stand to be in a relationship with someone like that too."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,FixinThePlanet,2,Wed Dec 10 04:29:07 2014 UTC,"First, sorry to OP for her experience.  That really sucks :(   Besides the obvious fallacy this dude employed that ""feminism solved all that back in the 80s,"" is there anything inherently incorrect with egalitarianism as a concept?"
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,FixinThePlanet,4,Wed Dec 10 18:29:46 2014 UTC,"It's the #alllivesmatter of gender issues. This comic does a pretty good job of succinctly summarizing it.  It's perfectly possible to be an egalitarian in terms of long-term ideals, but specifically focused on a particular women's issue (or set of women's issues) in terms of where you think your energy would be best spent. It's basically like choosing a charity to donate your funds to even though you know there are dozens championing causes you think are valid."
FemmeThoughts,2otjzd,hermithome,8,Wed Dec 10 21:01:15 2014 UTC,"Exactly. In order to get an egalitarian outcome, you need feminism. For example, some churches and synagogues will advertise that their services are egalitarian. This means that both men and women take on the same leadership roles, and generally, that God is referred to as genderless, or they switch between male and female pronouns. The outcome is egalitarian. But they got to that outcome via feminism. That outcome is the result of pushes to allow women to be treated equally, and the result of pushes to stop thinking gendering God as a man.   People who consider themselves egalitarian generally fall into a few categories:    clueless about feminism (they think feminism pushes for the superiority of women) clueless about the real world (they think men and women are already equal) afraid (of labelling themselves a feminist and being perceived as angry or evil) / squicked out by the word (they get what feminism is, get that it's needed, but does the name have to be feminism?)   Basically, not worth your time regardless of why."

Crappy human beings, but still feminists. Mainstream feminist has a long history of serious problems with intersectionality. There's unfortunately a lot of transphobia and racism in parts of feminism.   What I want to know is once and for all, does feminism exclude transwomen, men, transmen, and nonbinaries?   There's no simple answer to that. There are hundreds of schools of feminism. Second wave, third wave, fourth wave, liberal, ecofeminism, anarachafeminism, black feminism, womanism, sex positive feminism, sex negative feminism, marxist feminism, post colonial feminism, post modern feminism, lesbian feminism, queer feminism, trans feminism, radical feminism that excludes trans people, radical feminism that doesn't exclude trans people, liberal feminism, fuck, I shoulda done this list alphabetically, and more.  A lot of feminists don't exclude transgender people. But some do. What you're encountered is a specific brand of radical feminism that focuses intensely on excluding trans people. We generally call them TERFs - trans excluding radical feminists. It kinda sucks how they've co-opted the radical feminism brand. Because in actuality, their politics aren't radical at all. They range from liberal to regressive. As a feminist who actually holds radical political views, that shit just pisses me off.  In terms of this subreddit, we have zero tolerance for transphobia. Period. It's not something we allow. Nor is it allowed at /r/FemmeThoughtsFeminism. But unfortunately, there are some feminist subs on reddit that allow this stuff - a few are basically trans hate groups. Fortunately though, there are a bunch of awesome trans subs to counter that. Take a look at our long list of related subreddits. There are a bunch of trans subs on there that you might be interested in. We also mention the transphobic subs down in the warning section so you know what to stay away from.  And if you see transphobia (or other rule breaking) anywhere on this sub or /r/FemmeThoughtsFeminism, please, please please, let us know! Use the report button or send us a modmail."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,hermithome,7,Wed Dec 10 02:35:53 2014 UTC,<3 -trans woman that just found this sub. OP I'm so sorry that you had to go through that. I think a huge question is what is the single shared concept that allows all these vastly different ideologies to exist under the same word? Is it the betterment of women and the abolishing of patriarchy? If so I would say that any ideology that excludes trans women isn't really feminism.
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,tganon123,16,Wed Dec 10 03:16:30 2014 UTC,"If so I would say that any ideology that excludes trans women isn't really feminism.   TERFs absolutely believe in the betterment of women and abolishing of the patriarchy. They're also just bigoted. Excluding trans people actually goes against a lot of feminist ideas in terms of biological essentialism and agency. But people are able to hold contradictory, hypocritical beliefs. They do all the time.   The sad truth is is that a LOT of feminism isn't intersectional. For those of us who consider intersectionality a crucial part of feminism, this can be hard to recognise. Unfortunately, it exists and it's still feminism. And decrying TERFs as ""not feminism"" simply because it's not a feminism that we recognise is a cop-out. (Same goes for white feminism).  Especially since these are often views espoused by mainstream feminists - the ones who get the publicity and who often speak as the voice of feminism. What we as feminists need to do is speak out against these bad feminists and make intersectionality a priority."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,hermithome,9,Wed Dec 10 05:06:38 2014 UTC,"If we hold it to be an immutable fact that trans women are women than TERFs don't fit under those two unifying principles. I could see how feminism that doesn't respect intersectionality, such as white feminism or straight feminism is bad feminism, while still being feminism. I think a proper parallel is if a cis feminist recognized trans women were women, but refused to be aware of their cis privilege."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,tganon123,10,Wed Dec 10 05:35:00 2014 UTC,"If we hold it to be an immutable fact that trans women are women than TERFs don't fit under those two unifying principles.    We do. They don't.   No, it's not the same thing as white feminism or straight feminism - there's a reason we call the TERF subs hate subs. I didn't mean to imply that they were equivalent, they absolutely aren't.  I see the point your making. And there's a part of my that agrees. However TERF attitudes are depressingly mainstream. And until the mainstream feminist movements recognises that supporting trans women is an essential part of feminism, I don't think it's fair to say that TERFs aren't feminists. Because in way too many areas, they're not just feminists, but the most prominent feminists.  Just dismissing them as ""not feminist"" seems to me to be too easy. It's no true Scotsman. It's dismissing depressingly large and significant parts of the feminist movement. It's just too easy. And I feel my responsibility is larger than that."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,hermithome,4,Wed Dec 10 05:50:14 2014 UTC,":( Why do things suck? How can I share a movement with people that want to erase my existence? I understand there is a lot of messed up history, especially with Janice Raymond and her ilk, but is mainstream feminism still super transphobic? I thought they were just a loud fringe group. What do we do?"
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,Glass_Underfoot,6,Wed Dec 10 06:01:20 2014 UTC,"We do this. We speak up.   Most TERF stuff is fringes. But there are quite a mainstream feminists in their camp. And there are more mainstream feminists who aren't TERFs, but are still wigged out about trans stuff, or just uneducated.  We speak up. We make sure our feminism is intersectional. And we hold them accountable. There's been a huge push lately with regard to awareness of trans issues and activism. Be a part of that push.  On a mental health note, it also helps to take the time to celebrate the good stuff, instead of focusing on the bad. Not saying don't be aware of the bad, just don't fixate on it."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,hermithome,12,Wed Dec 10 13:43:08 2014 UTC,"Feminism isn't about being transphobic. And yet there are transphobic feminists. But there are transphobic bakers, transphobic radical left-wingers, transphobic lawyers, and even transphobic trans people. We live in a transphobic society, so you'll find transphobia everywhere. And it sucks. I know some feminists who think that trans-inclusion is so central to their feminism that they think you can't be a good feminist if you're a transphobe. I know some feminists who are the exact opposite. There's no necessary connection between feminism and transphobia, or trans acceptance, because feminism doesn't come pre-packaged with a theory of gender. Different feminists will work with and on different theories (I think trans-inclusive ones are better than trans-exclusive ones), and I think that's where the trouble starts."

FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,Whatisthisguys,9,Thu Dec 11 18:32:11 2014 UTC,"TERFs and those who follow similar feminst ideologies have crafted a very narrow theory as to how society functions, what structures and systems of oppression exist, and all the historical interpretations that have upheld these. Anything that might challenge their ideology is generally brushed off, and because trans people can no longer so easily be brushed off, they tend to be quite aggressive.   These are feminists who sought to remove access to healthcare for trans individuals (and managed to succeed in some places), these are feminists who allied themselves with hardline right wing evangelist christian conservatives to act upon their ideology and goals. These are feminists whose subgroup at one point were militarized and have issued death threats to trans people, and who currently aim to 'doxx' and harass trans people as often as they can. These are people who believe in biological essentialism while supposedly fighting against biological essentialism. These are people whose subgroup has historically supported the idea that sexuality is very much a choice and is more political than innate. These are feminists who historically have denied the agency of third world women and their voices, and have constructed a narrative as to why this denial is entirely alright, and isn't colonialist or white supremacist at all to do so. These are feminists who, in the past have used acronyms and who have pressured organizations and schools not to support certain groups, but who now claim such acts against THEM are silencing and oppressive.   I could go on and on and on. Mostly because when I was 17, I was a self-identified (trans inclusive) radical feminist trans woman, and over time had to deal with crossing paths with these people, and came to learn quite a bit about them.   Fact is, they're wrong. They're dead set on their believes as much as a die-hard born again Christian is set in their faith, and nothing is going to change their world view.   But they're not all of feminism, or even a large minority portion. They're small. Vocal, and horrendously annoying and terrible, but small. Still feminists due to their ideology holding historical relevance, and under that context meeting the criteria of feminism (as there is no single correct form of feminism...it's sociopolitical ideology), but not ones that are well accepted among feminism these days. They still find support among non-feminists, mostly due to trans issues being a bit of a firestarter, and people generally knowing jack shit about us, so they claim a ""side"" in the ""debate"" which they honesty have no right to, as there aren't two equal sides. There's one truth, and that's trans people are real, valid people.   And hopefully, people in general will come around to that conclusion sooner than later, and TERFs will lose their last foothold on relevance. Until then? Best to ignore them as much as possible, as their media priority at the moment is to bait trans people into poor reactions, then try to use those reactions to paint us all as terrible, mentally ill (heaven forbid...wish it wasn't seen as a negative, but in society today it sadly still is), perverted people with tendencies toward violence and anger. They're cis, and generally white, so they tend to get the benefit of the doubt by the media, sadly, whereas we do not."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,Like_it_spooky,4,Thu Dec 11 22:54:42 2014 UTC,"Ugh, I'm so sorry that other women have treated you like that. As people have said, feminism is one of the broadest movements you're likely to find and you'll definitely get some people who have nasty, unhelpful views just because of sheer numbers.   I would personally consider any anti-trans feminist a sort of extremist within the movement, although it might just be that in my experience I haven't come across them so much. But please don't let these confused, narrow-minded individuals alienate you from feminism, because there is so much positivity and acceptance to be found beyond their poisonous little corner.   Some people just like to tell others what to do, and it doesn't mean they're right. You have just as much a right to feminism as they do, and we need as many trans feminists as possible so greater knowledge, support and understanding can build inside the movement. Take their attempted exclusion and turn it into a reminder that feminism needs you a lot more than it needs them."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,Gonterf,5,Wed Dec 10 12:38:36 2014 UTC,"In my experience, the LGBT part of femism is better in some groups and worse in others, and I just went group-hopping until I was satisfied. I've had bad experiences as a pansexual with some groups, and I think that if one is bad with bi and pans, they'll be bad with trans women as well. One said something like ""the patriarchy tells people who they should find attractive, and if the patriarchy didn't exist we would find everyone attractive like pansexuals"". Yeeeah. I was witch-hunted out for objecting to that."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,thesilvertongue,6,Wed Dec 10 15:54:45 2014 UTC,"If I am feminist, do I believe that biology = destiny? Do I believe that being a woman means some of my skills and traits will always be of a lower (or higher) standard than those of a man, no-matter how hard I try? Do I consequently believe that it is natural and appropriate for a different set of rules to apply to men vs. women? I think I know what the answers are to those questions.  Regardless of whether I was born a woman, or whether my trans-ness is the product of a developmental disorder or mental health issue, the fact remains that being a woman is the path that I am on. It doesn't matter, I'm still a woman. My journey to womanhood is still both a courageous and valuable thing, and an experience that is inherently, fundamentally feminist in nature.  To believe that a woman has the right (and the ability) to make her own choices in life, and simultaneously believe that a person cannot choose to be a woman (or man), is contradictory. No, I do not believe that TERFs can rightly be called feminist. Mind you, this isn't something I've put a whole lot of thought into, because the best solution for me has always been simply to ignore/ridicule them - when I live my life freely and happily as a woman, I will have won, and they will have lost."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,kidkvlt,5,Wed Dec 17 03:17:12 2014 UTC,"There are some people who get called feminist who have literally no connection to feminism whatsoever. Sadly TERFs, aren't those people. TERFs have got pretty clear roots in some older feminist theories and writings.  Some of these people have just become full on anti LGBQT hate groups.  If you've got shit to say about TERFs, /r/gendercynical can be really cathartic."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,nbreg,2,Wed Dec 10 03:08:58 2014 UTC,"One tenant in some schools of feminism is that gender is a social construct, therefore any trans person is just deluding themselves because ""feeling like a woman"" isn't a REAL feeling (according to them). I think this is pretty obtuse. I do believe that gender IS a social construct but that doesn't mean that we don't form our identities without society's ideas about gender and excluding trans people and telling them that they're wrong or crazy is WAY WAY unhelpful and sets us back."
FemmeThoughts,2otlr0,angrychill,2,Wed Dec 10 05:54:42 2014 UTC,"I don't have much to add, except my own opinion, which is that I don't understand why feminists -- the pioneers of gender theory -- would exclude trans people.  I wouldn't say that feminism excludes trans and non-binaries, because it is feminism that has advocated for the deconstruction of biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.   I do think the complexity of gender theory is better explored and appreciated in academic feminism, and that in popular feminist media, there is a huge problem with the men vs. women dialogue.  Laverne Cox from Orange is the New Black is helping trans gender issues become a more household issue, which is great."

I think that a lot of older men are pushy and gross because they are entitled scumbags who believe that money and experience gives them the right to just ""take"" any woman they want to use her body.   Of course, then there's the guys who are just gross and desperate, so they basically are willing to throw themselves at anyone on the off chance it works.   As a woman, it is important to know that your feelings are yours. People can choose to act a certain way. You can think that they are gross. It is not your job to cater to others. Anyone who says otherwise is a douchenozzle."

FemmeThoughts,2oq9dd,Shaysdays,39,Tue Dec 9 08:12:15 2014 UTC,"I think that desperation can often make people feel justified in behaving badly. So they may behave badly because they feel that there is little imperative for them to be respectful.   There is no shame in being desperate. But there is such a thing as behaving poorly out of desperation, and most guys who behave in this manner would refrain from doing so if they were, say, in the company of their boss or their parents or something.   By all means, don't feel ashamed for feeling desperate. But that doesn't give you the carte blanche to behave in a gross manner with impunity because of it."
FemmeThoughts,2oq9dd,Oniknight,7,Tue Dec 9 09:32:58 2014 UTC,"I feel that loneliness and desperation are two different feelings. Desperation implies a ""do anything to get what you want"" mentality, including ethically questionable or inappropriate things like violating someone else's boundaries or invalidating their feelings.   Loneliness, even very intensely felt, is a very real feeling, and I agree that it should not be shamed. But I think it is still different in the level of control the afflicted person has when they approach their feelings. When the intensity of the feelings causes them to do or say inappropriate things, I think it's entirely valid to condemn it. Having feelings doesn't excuse otherwise inappropriate behavior. But of course, feeling these things and still having enough self-control to express them in safe and affirming ways should definitely not be condemned."

I don't think you need to find rules on when you should be creeped out and then follow those rules, whether made by friends or others.

(A bit of a drama queen at times, but she's 6; it's kind of expected.) I'm an emotionless robot. I have to constantly remind myself that people usually have feelings, and those feelings are valid.  Instead, what I'm trying to do lately, is to constructively animate those feelings. She'll often cry, or shrink into herself when she feels she's done something wrong or if things aren't going her way. (A byproduct of my wife's tendency to yell a bit.) I tell her that it's okay to feel that way, but we need to clean up the mess (spilled milk, say), assess the problem (a broken toy), or whatnot.  I'm hoping that I can preserve her feelings (gods, but I don't want to squash what is a very core, special part of her personality and something that has made me want to be a better person for it) while still showing her how to work in adversity, such as it is.  Before I subbed to 2XC or was recommended here, I saw a real lesson on this when a mother just absolutely squashed her son's feelings. I noted the instance because she was wrong about the subject, but she just hammered him down until he stood staring at the floor. I vowed to never do that to my future kid(s).

FemmeThoughts,2oq9dd,AppleSpicer,2,Tue Dec 9 08:03:17 2014 UTC,"An important perspective about feelings that may help you is to remember that all feelings are linked with needs. For example I'm sometimes afraid or anxious about meeting new people because I have a need to be treated with respect. These feelings come from futurising what might happen based on past experiences. Your daughter might be sad when she spills milk because of a need to have your approval, or maybe a need to not be yelled at, or maybe a need to drink milk and now it's on the floor. Ask her about it. I'm just starting to learn about the needs linked with my feelings and it really helps me process too much anxiety. It might also be a way for you to help encourage her feelings but also put them into perspective so they have less control over her.   In short the advice given to me is: feel the feeling, what is it?, what's the need behind it?, is it met/unmet?, if unmet how do we meet that need?, action plan time!, how does the feeling feel now?  Hope this is in any way helpful!"

They're people, and if they aren't persistent after being rejected and actually respect my decision, then I don't have much right to call them creepy. I've also dealt with a tonne of super creepy younger guys, so I've concluded that it's all about the individual's behaviour that renders them a creep or not. You can be a creep whether you're 15 or 65.  Also, after reading through the comments in your post, I don't feel anybody was suggesting you HAVE to be okay with older men hitting on you, just that there's no reason to be rude about rejecting them. If you're polite when you decline them and they respond negatively, then of course that's a wholly different situation, but I have to agree that someone offering a polite advance isn't automatically a creep based on their age. There is a time and place for everything, and if we were talking about a middle aged man hitting on teenagers outside their highschool, well that's a lot different than a middle aged man approaching a young (but obviously legal) person in a bar or other adult venue. Context, is what I'm getting at!"

If I'm somewhere like a nightclub and I'm getting hit on as a sexual conquest, I'm not as bothered by it. That's kind of what those places are for.   If I'm or hanging with some friends in a low-key bar, I take a little offense just because I'm not into getting picked up or one night stands and I feel like that I'm obviously just chilling and not looking for a date.   If I'm out getting coffee and you're scamming on me, you better take a step back because I'm not about to hook up with some rando while I'm going about my daily business.

FemmeThoughts,2oq9dd,Shaysdays,17,Tue Dec 9 16:45:06 2014 UTC,"As I approach the tail end of my 20s, I've started to realize why older men hit on me a decade ago and almost never do that anymore. Teenage girls tend to be unsure of themselves, and haven't polished their reactions to sketchy situations. It tends to be a deer in headlights moment, and some older men take advantage of that inexperienced reaction.  If a creepy older dude hit on me now I'd have no problem telling him to fuck right off, but a decade ago I would have tried my best to be nice and not really have known how to tell him off - hell that actually happened countless times to me. It's predatory behavior and these men know better than to try it on a woman who's been in the adult world for a while and has had practice shaking off the creepy types."
FemmeThoughts,2oq9dd,linguistrose,8,Tue Dec 9 16:49:48 2014 UTC,"You certainly aren't obligated to be attracted to anyone. And you absolutely have the right to feel that someone who is straight up hitting on you is gross. Especially if all they are into is your body. If you want like, a one night stand, and you're turning down guys based purely on their age- that's cool too! No one is obligated to be attracted to anyone.  As long as you're not just totally writing anyone older off because of only that- if the age thing is only gross because the guys who do that are the annoying pushy type who try to insert themselves into your love life instead of just meeting you and going with whatever flow there might possibly be- you aren't mad at them flirting at their age, you're mad at them assuming you will be impressed and intimidated by that. And hell ya, that is annoying and horrible.  Trufax- I married someone 14 hours older than me. I was a single mom, he was a bachelor, it worked out pretty well for us for where we were/are in our lives. It isn't for everyone. But we didn't even date at first, we just enjoyed each other's company because of shared interests and never thought anything would really happen. If at any point he had assumed I wasn't his equal, it never would have happened."

I can think of strict laws in Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia =/= the entire Middle East.  Are you talking about laws in Iran, maybe?  But they're not an Arab country.  Most Arab muslim women who keep hijab (Islamic standards for modest dress) CHOOSE to keep hijab because of her own personal religious and spiritual journey.  It's (in the vast majority of cases) not about any governmental laws.  Also, there is hijab for men too. It doesn't include covering hair, but it does include various standards of modest dress.  There are very few Middle Eastern countries that actually have any sort of enforced, restrictive laws about female dress. But if you want to see what people wear to the beach in one of many Arab countries, google Beirut beach parties."
FemmeThoughts,2okm6i,creamcheesefiasco,-3,Tue Dec 9 02:49:46 2014 UTC,"""There"" is Saudi, Yemen, Oman, parts of Iran and Afghanistan, etc. I'm not talking about all Arab countries, but true, the comments I'm angry were generalizing them.   Most Arab muslim women who keep hijab (Islamic standards for modest dress) CHOOSE to keep hijab because of her own personal religious and spiritual journey   Yeah, that's a great thing for the lucky 1% of muslim women who come from liberal families and actually did have a choice to say, but it's just not true. First of all, the laws in many Arab countries enforce a strict dress code. Second, when your family and your culture pressure you, it's not 'choice'. Thirdly, I know the dress code for men in islam, and it is no where near as strict as the dress code for women.  You linked a place the urban wealthy elite go to in one of the most generally liberal arab countries.   Please, stop. That's not a message just to you, but to everyone who's trying to convince the mainstream about how everything's about choice, everything in certain countries are fine, it's just the culture, etc, etc. You are actively hurting women from those places, and all you seems to care about looking good to mainstream feminism."
FemmeThoughts,2okm6i,creamcheesefiasco,6,Mon Dec 8 03:56:16 2014 UTC,"As someone else pointed out, Iran and Afghanistan are not Arab countries.  And as another poster pointed out, there is a large portion of the Arab population that is not even Muslim, and many, many Muslims who are not even close to being Arab.    And yes, I linked to a wealthy, liberal place not as a way of representing the whole of the Middle East, but as a counter-narrative to what is being espoused in this thread and American society in general vis à vis the Middle East. The Middle East is not a monolith.  Your 1% statistic is extremely hyperbolic and in fact damaging to Arab muslim women who are working towards greater equality, as it becomes easy to now disregard the opinions of these women and write them off as misguided, uninformed or even brainwashed since they are so controlled by their ""family and culture.""  I'm not saying that everything in these countries is fine.  I'm not saying that it's all about choice as it's obviously far more nuanced in ways that neither you, nor me, nor anyone else who is not an Arab muslim can understand.  My main issue with discussions like this is that so often, Western women attempt to speak for other women, especially Arab and/or Muslim women. A huge part of any social movement is for those who have been marginalized to reclaim their own voice and the ability to challenge the status quo with their own narratives. The western woman, in her eagerness to ""liberate"" and ""civilize"" the Middle Eastern woman, is actually doing the opposite of that.  She is reinforcing a colonial mythology constructed by Western powers to justify their exploitation of non-Western peoples.  It's white (wo)man's burden.  I do believe that you care about these women, so please, please, let them have their own voices and speak for themselves about what their realities are instead of trying to tell them how oppressed they are.  Do you know any Arab and/or muslim women?  Can you talk to them about how they see the state of women's rights in their societies?  Do you know any women who wear hijab?  Can you ask them about why they do so and what it means to them?  Can you listen to her speak without thinking the whole time that the poor woman is so brainwashed by her backwards culture? Part of the reason I do get upset when I see blanket statements like I've seen here is because of all of the wonderful, intelligent, passionate Arab and Muslim women I know.  I've seen them try to speak about their own realties, I've seen them constructing their own narratives, and I've seen my white friends rolling their eyes at them or looking at them with pity because they choose to wear hijab.    I would suggest doing some reading about feminism in Arab countries as well as postcolonial theory in general.  A quick google found this article which has some good initial quotes that illustrate why I find discussions like this harmful.   I understood—and not for the first time—the astounding disconnection between the lives of Arab women, and the lives of Arab women as represented by the American media and entertainment industries, thus as perceived by Americans themselves. Twenty-three years after the publication of Edward Said’s seminal book, Orientalism, which clarified the historical pattern of misrepresentation and demonization of the Middle East, many Americans continue to purchase wholesale the neatly packaged image of the veiled, meek Arab woman. This pitiful creature follows her husband like a dark shadow, is forced to remain silent and obey her husband at all times, is granted a body only to deliver more children, perhaps even in competition with her husband’s other wives.   Further on:   The statements made by my ponytailed student smacked of an underlying assumption that I have heard many times before: we American women have finally succeeded in moving the feminist movement to the top of our nation’s list of priorities; now it’s time to help our less fortunate sisters. Of course, over the years, American feminism has opened its gates (after much pounding) to other versions of feminism, such as black feminism and other non-white, non-upper-middle-class feminisms. Therefore, the focus on Arab women’s issues illustrates the good intentions of American feminism; however, my concern is with the “big sister” manner in which those intentions are manifested. Often, Arab women’s voices are excluded from discussions concerning their own lives, and they are to be “informed” about feminism, as if it is an ideology exclusive to American women alone.    In fact, many American women would be surprised to learn that the history of Arab feminism (a term often considered oxymoronic) is long, layered, and impressive. That this is not well understood in the West is not surprising.   Further on in the article it touches on the veil.  I'm currently sick and have to go work now so I haven't had time to read the whole thing, but my main point is that it is good that you care about women's rights in other parts of the world, but these women need to be allowed to construct their own narrative without Western feminism imposing orientalist ideology upon them.  The best way we can be allies to women in other parts of the world is to support them in constructing their own narratives, even when those narratives challenge our own cultural paradigms for what ""good"" feminism is.  There is a lot of great literature out there about postcolonial feminism.  Let me know if you want any reading recommendations."

It invariably gets lots of community support and then the mods ignore it.    seemingly put no effort into regulating the posts even though ""our mods can handle it"" was their main justification   They don't really remove anything that isn't blatantly awful. There are no rules against mansplaining, and you can rant about false rape accusations all you want. The rules are way too permissive."
FemmeThoughts,2ojk6w,picklesitter,41,Tue Dec 9 05:02:43 2014 UTC,"Reporting is anonymous. They can't ban you for it. They can report you to the admins and accuse you of abusing the feature, but that's generally reserved for actual abuse (like someone reporting months old stuff, or reporting things that aren't against the rules). Reporting a tonne of comments that are against the rules is how the system is supposed to work.  That said, I doubt it will do anything. Yeah, a huge part of the subs problems are due to going default. (for more numbers go here) But the mods were always a problem. Quoting from our related subreddits wiki:   /r/TwoXChromosomes  - Mods focus more on tone-policing then cleaning up mansplaining and trolling. They even have a ""no misandry"" policy, which dates back to 2010 (see snapshots for 18/02/2010 and 01/03/2010). The tagline for the community has been ""You are the community. You have all the power of the internet to mold it."" off and on for the past few years. That is, moderators take a hands-off approach. The power of the internet is the power only of the average user: a voice and a vote. In mid 2014, twox became a default subreddit, which has made things worse.   In regard to the recent petition on blackladies that reddit do something about the huge racism problem they deal with, 2x did NOT sign the letter and said this to a reported when asked:   “Racism and bigotry are highly complex problems that cannot be solved with the signing of a letter, or a website policing its users, or giving the trolls a spotlight. We are patently disinterested,” subreddit co-founder HiFructoseCornFeces explained. “Growing up means realizing that combating evil does not mean spending all of your energy stamping out every last flicker of fuckery, but in issuing forth genuine goodness whole-heartedly and with resonance.”   link   This is not new. This is not an accident. This is not a result of ""going default"". This is the type of community that the moderators want."
FemmeThoughts,2ojk6w,hermithome,29,Sun Dec 7 18:05:21 2014 UTC,"Whoa. Somehow I missed all this. ""...every last flicker of fuckery,"" really sticks with me. Racism is not simply a ""flicker of fuckery."""

There's a lot of mod overlap, and the bigger TrollX gets, the more utter shite comes in, and the mods do very little about it."

FemmeThoughts,2ojk6w,StarStudlyBudly,8,Sun Dec 7 19:50:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the modding's always been an issue. It was masked early on when there weren't so many subscribers, but these days they're largely absent. They have said in the past, iirc, that banning doesn't do anything but give attention to trolls, but I've seen evidence to the contrary in a few select cases.  And, like, I know it didn't go over well at all on /r/lgbt/ but I feel the only way to bring TwoX back closer to where it used to be would be to utilize the kind of  mod practices that made that place super controversial (though the ban-heavy attitude was certainly warranted at the time, tbh, given the climate). They pointed out the subreddit's purpose and rules, and decided to just screw being nice and used their banhammers as they saw fit until a lot of people(probably the majority, really) just up and left. Of course, TwoX would also have to take themselves off default to accomplish that, but...I don't see any other way for them to reel in the perpetual shitstorm TwoX is locked in.  And as you said, I doubt they even see it as a problem, given their background and past attitudes, so..."
FemmeThoughts,2ojk6w,lockedge,8,Sun Dec 7 21:42:21 2014 UTC,"Actually, I think they could successfully moderate even as a default. It would just be a lot of work. They'd need to ban a lot of users and botban a lot of users. They'd need to bring on a bunch more mods. I mean, look at /r/Science they have over 600 mods.  What they'd need to do, is write some great auotmod scripts. You can have certain kinds of slurs, or tip off language just automatically removed. You can also set the bot, or the subreddit to filter everything not by approved submitters. It wouldn't be easy, but they could do it.   Though I think they probably would have to take themselves off default status to turn the place around."

Took a few moments to click that the user was a guy, not a woman.

FemmeThoughts,2ojk6w,tomato_water,55,Sun Dec 7 15:30:58 2014 UTC,Yeah I noticed that too. Apparently feminism is outdated and we should call ourselves egalitarians and focus entirely on white heterosexual men. But what makes me the saddest is seeing women agreeing with them.

A lot of people are; they're lazy, or perhaps various -ism doesn't affect them in any meaningful way yet, and actually understand feminism does take effort -- you can't just read a couple of real talking reddit comments, some of it is really heavy stuff. In the meantime the antifeminism is super loud, especially on the internet, and it's pretty mainstream (and the golden mean is always a fan favourite). To top it all off we're fresh out of a trend where caring about anything was just not cool. So in effect we get a bunch of people who think ""I'm an egalitarian/humanist, I care about human issues!"" actually mean anything to anybody."
FemmeThoughts,2ojk6w,lockedge,19,Mon Dec 8 01:08:10 2014 UTC,"Sadly (or not so much) I do think there are a bunch of fake accounts.  It's kind of like with tumblr, how a bunch of cis dudes create profiles as whatever type of stereotype they like to make fun of, and post a bunch of crap. My go-to example is how last year when I scoured tumblr, the vast, vast majority of instances where someone said or brought up ""die cis scum"" were done by cis folk or anons whose messages were clear subgroup trolling posts to make trans people look dumb. I can't remember how many actual trans person's accounts I saw that brought up the term in a hostile manner, but it was under ten after about 4 straight hours of curious searching.  The thing is, trolls troll, but sometimes it can be difficult to discern trolls from regular folk, which is a huge problem in TwoX right now. A lot of people with well established accounts and high karma values troll and people rarely think twice because their accounts don't ""look"" like trolls, and they can be brushed off as dissenting voices, or people who are just there to stir the pot, so to speak. It's effective trolling.  Just like pushing for ""egalitarianism"". Maybe a few percent of the people who push for it are being honest, but if you press hard enough with most, you'll find that they actually don't want anything done. A feminist discussion about rape and sexual assault can get derailed into egalitarianism and follow the path until the person admits that they don't feel any changes should be made to the status quo, that it's not necessary. Same with wage disparity, racism, etc., this stance of egalitarianism holding the status quo only changing when it's to *gasp* benefit men.   It's a bunch of bullcrap. Thankfully, a lot of it is transparent bullcrap, but still bullcrap. :("

People don't post about funny or silly things because their posts get 22% upvote ratios and people learn that those posts just won't be supported anymore. People post for support less and less, and with more and more disclaimers because of how hostile the sub is now.  It's depressing, but sort of disgustingly funny that the proponents of the trollish turn the sub's taken defend it based on some idea of an ""echo chamber"". TwoX used to be much more diverse than it is right now, because it's since gained ~500k users that all believe similar things, with similar worldviews, and their misogynist, trollish views are actually CREATING an ""echo chamber"" in TwoX.

I think TrollX is up to about 90k now, and you can see that, particularly on the posts hitting 2k+ karma. You go in those now, and see an awful lot of comments that make you go, ""huh? This is TrollX, right? How are these comments getting upvoted?"". It does suck, but at least the mod team is active, and at the moment the purpose is still alive and well, so I really do wonder how well it will buck the trend as it continues to grow. I love TrollX, so I hope it stays awesome!"
FemmeThoughts,2ojk6w,LovelyFugly,4,Mon Dec 8 00:05:21 2014 UTC,"You can keep the original purpose of a sub, you just need active moderation. Unfortunately, the trollx mods are mostly 2x mods and they seem to share the same mod policy of don't do anything."

FemmeThoughts,2ojk6w,bombeater,27,Mon Dec 8 04:59:52 2014 UTC,"I'm one of those people who thought it was kind of crap even before it got defaulted. But now?   Like every other ""for ladies"" sub that men find, dudes flood the sub like a zoo policing the topics with downvotes and ""as a man"" comments. It requires moderation to allow women subs to exist as safer spaces for women, and I'm of the opinion that 2x never had that, so them becoming a default just means it's now a sub for men to talk about women's things instead of a place for women to talk about anything."

It was upsetting, because besides the random trolls it was a really cool, supportive place. Now it's ""well from a man's perspective.."" or ""I'm not a female but..""  Um if I wanted a male perspective I wouldn't post on a sub that is meant for females."

FemmeThoughts,2ojk6w,hollyharlow,17,Sun Dec 7 20:35:10 2014 UTC,"Before it become a default I posted there when my brother died and again when i had a bad break-up (on throwaways). I was at an extreme low point in my life, and the women on there were so nice, supportive, really helped me. I even PM'd a couple when I had future low points.  Since being a default I'd wouldn't dare post intimate feeling on there for support, I'd be scared of hostile comments, victim blaming, and the horrible private PM's that seem to pop up as soon as you post on there now."
FemmeThoughts,2ojk6w,kazimira,13,Mon Dec 8 17:05:38 2014 UTC,"I used to read the Hairpin a lot. I remember people discussing Reddit on there (and how insanely misogynist/racist/you name it its commenters are) and a few people saying, ""No...wait! There's TwoX! Check it out, it's great!"" So I did, and I've spent plenty of time there...and still do on occasion. Although it seemed like a relatively supportive community compared to the rest of Reddit: for every person that fit that description, there were two more whose 2 cents to every post seemed generally indicative of inexperienced, privileged people who are sorta into feminism but don't want to be accused of being a ""radfem.""   The complaints about how there's too many sad/trigger posts have been there long before defaulting. Yes, the world is a shit place. Some days, I take a break from reading about it. However, it's really fucking weak to actually attempt to silence people's reality because you are not personally living it.   You could make the argument that both by defaulting and having those sorts of posts could be useful for some reflection. Maybe it is opening people up. But I've never found any of the dialogue to actually be productive. For instance, whenever the topic of weight comes up: It's clear as rain that nearly everyone, regardless of size, who is commenting is hurting and greatly so. The anger I've seen is really sad and it just feels like there is no attempt on either ""side"" to understand one another. It's all about your own pain and invalidating other people. Maybe I'm expecting too much from an internet forum, but I really want better from a community."

Anyway, I was able to somewhat avoid the really stupid shit but the constant tug-o-war between between fat and thin, small tits and huge cannons, promiscuity and the more sexually shy, to some degree men versus women, and make up or au natural was just so tiring. And that was most likely the actual women who stuck around (goaded on by the trolls but still).  That's why I liked trollx, it was never really a competition for the spotlight.

But the comments will always be taken as a platform for every anti-feminist to launch their views.   In some ways I hope that by those people actually reading the topics and comments they might, slowly over time become more accepting of a more inclusive world view.  But for now, we have to deal with the obnoxious posters with a major axe to grand, who really care more about 'winning internet arguments' than about any how gender treats anyone.  The mods do a stellar job though, the trolls and harrassers are deleted pretty swiftly. I don't want to abandon the sub and let it become completely overrun. I think I can use it as my own platform to set a few things straight with certain commenters."

Highly polarizing politicial stuff gets upvoted too much and lots of other really interesting or insightful things get down-voted because there is nothing to start a massive argument about.   I'm all for discussion, but 2x has kind of gone past discussion at this point and is more the internet equivalent of flinging poo at people."

FemmeThoughts,2oi7ij,onlykindagreen,3,Sun Dec 7 05:48:15 2014 UTC,Can I ask why people have a problem with the term rape culture? I've always thought it was a decent term for a thing that actually exists.
FemmeThoughts,2oi7ij,StarStudlyBudly,8,Sun Dec 7 19:36:18 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I was just telling my boyfriend, I think people who perpetuate rape culture (knowingly or unknowingly) are the ones who oppose the term. If you've experienced it first hand, you hear the term and a little lightbulb happens where you're like ""oh, I totally get that! I see that a lot!"" but if you haven't personally experienced it, and you feel like it describes some things that come uncomfortably close to things you do, you get upset. People want to wave their hands and insist that there's really nothing wrong any more. Women work now, men stay home with the kids, we're all equal.   To step back and see real problems from a perspective that is not your own is often hard. And taking blame for things is hard too. When you accept the term rape culture you do a little bit of both. You have to realize that there can be a serious issue even if you or a close friend of yours hasn't physically seen it. And then you have to take a little bit of the blame for perpetuating the problem in your ignorance. That's upsetting to people who honestly don't think they've done anything wrong, and who really don't see the issue."
FemmeThoughts,2oi7ij,onlykindagreen,6,Sun Dec 7 19:43:10 2014 UTC,Thank you for such a detailed reply! That perfectly explains it. It also explains why it's so hard to get people to stop making rape jokes- they have to admit what they're doing is wrong and fucked up and that it actually happens.
FemmeThoughts,2oi7ij,StarStudlyBudly,10,Sun Dec 7 19:46:59 2014 UTC,Ick. It's hard to believe that was real. Why are people so terrible?  I wonder what the speech for the men had in it? I'll bet it had nothing to do with they way they dress of what kind of wives will want them.

If we call each other ""bitches"" and ""sluts"", then that makes it okay for them to do the same! I finally stopped having that attitude when I learnt what feminism really was. The support for all women to make their own choices and become who they want to be on their terms and to be equal with those around them.

FemmeThoughts,2ocr5r,beadspritegirl,12,Fri Dec 5 15:43:44 2014 UTC,"Actually, there is a one size fits most shirt that actually fit most people and worked well. Anyone remember those amazing bubble shirts from oh, a decade or so ago?  For those of you who haven't seen them before, when they were ""on the rack"" (people didn't really hang them), they were like 4 inches squared. But they magically stretch and fit well, almost everyone. Then, when you take it off, it shrinks right back down to that tiny square. Oh yay, google image search turned up this.  And they looked good too. Also, they came in a tonne of colours and cuts, which helped. So, if you had a large bust, you'd probably not choose one with a bust line gradient.  Those things were awesome. You could keep it wadded up in a tight ball, so they were perfect to carry around and keep a spare shirt. And because the sizing was that awesome, you could lend to or borrow from everyone. So a lot of people would trade and share them, because that way you got more variety without having to spend. Not that they were expensive. I think they were maybe 10 or 15 bucks.  It was really awesome. One of the coolest things was introducing them to someone new. You'd see someone look at the display, and the ""one size fits all"" sign and snort, and almost instantly, someone else would be there to say ""no, they really do"" and convince them to try it on. It was a cool switch on the norm. Instead of everyone feeling excluded, everyone felt included. It was very cool."

American apparel does a lot of that ""one size fits all"" crap - they show pictures of 5'11"" models and yet all their clothes are made for women who are 5'5""-5'8"" at most. So everything goes up my bum or is way too short. I have yet to find a onesie or a jumper or a body suit that will actually fit me at any store. No, wait, I have one body suit that fits me from american apparel because it's strapless. If it has straps, I'm way too long from shoulders to crotch :/ Also, high-waisted pants are never high waisted enough on me. They often hit that awkward above muffin top below belly button spot so you get tummy bulge! Just can't win sometimes - especially not with one size fits all or uniform length things. I don't agree with one-size fits all stores even if they cater to the majority of the demographic (ie. the average height/size of their typical consumer). Very tall, very short, broad or narrow, larger, smaller, etc people always end up feeling like they're not ""normal"""

I was dumbfounded, I had absolutely no idea what I had done wrong.  I was pretty sad because I put a lot of myself in that comment and even made myself late for work to write it because I was so touched by the issues and felt I related to much to the post.    It turns out that it was using that word.  It was in an offhanded way that was meant to be witty (and was NOT directed at the OP or anyone else specifically).  I have issues with mental illness that I have struggled with all my life and my mother has been in and out of mental hospitals all my life as well.  Both my partner's bothers are mentally ill.  It's something I live with from all angles every day.  My point is, I am very sensitive to the issue you are discussing, but I had absolutely no idea that the word you are talking about was at all offensive, much less a slur severe enough to get a post deleted.

FemmeThoughts,2oa4dw,so_srs,2,Fri Dec 5 03:32:35 2014 UTC,"Quoting from our policy page on ableism.   No language that propagates harm  Most of you are already really great about following this rule when it comes to sexism and racism. But we need you to step up to the plate when it comes to ableism too. We don't have hard and fast rules on what specific words are okay, for all the reasons discussed here. No propagating harm is the guideline we use to decide whether or not something is ableist. But if you don't know the history of the language you are using, odds are that you won't do a great job of figuring out the contextual line. After all, just like sexism, it's hard to avoid ableism if you aren't aware of it. Privilege is tricky like that.    It's really easy to not know and to be totally caught off guard when you find out that your language is harmful. The important thing is that when someone brings you in the loop, you listen and learn.   And if you haven't already, you should really check out that policy page, as well as our Ableism 101 wiki. It's a great resource for learning about this stuff."

Edit: If someone personally asked me not to use a word around them though, I would make an honest effort not to. I can't promise to be very good about it on this sub though, since internet posting is a lot different from real life and I don't even remember what sub I'm posting in half the time."

And though many of us tried, I don't think we managed to convince him that bad behaviour was not equal to mental illness. And this is a smart guy too.  It's made me even more aware of using language carelessly. Because there are a lot of people who believe that behaving badly, especially if it's violent requires mental illness. Most people recognise that mental illness doesn't mean bad behaviour or violence, but the number of people who think that bad behaviour and violence requires mental illness is terrifying.  We need better language here. It's just essential."

Granted, I know that the whole Archangelle conspiracy thing is just that, a conspiracy.

That being said Clarkson does go to far in many cases as you pointed out, and he has been called out for racism before as well.  I remember one particular episode Clarkson said that ""you would have to be madder than a Mexican's dog"" to get carbon fiber side panels on an Audi R8.  I wasn't sure what to think, because I have seen some angry chihuahua's before, but then I realized I was racist for suggesting that all chihuahua's are owned by Mexicans."
FemmeThoughts,2oa4dw,Salt-Pile,3,Fri Dec 5 00:55:45 2014 UTC,"I agree, perceptions of what is offensive are shaped by history and cultural context. What is a term of respect in one country can be a term of insult in another.   But Clarkson courts controversy, particularly when he has a new book out. This courting has included the n word. His bread and butter is basically being ""anti-PC"" by British standards (good summary of this attitude here.)  While you have a different history in the US, I think that Britain too has a truly horrific history of racial discrimination, unsurprising since it is a former imperial power which was involved in violent colonisation, slave trade etc."

The father and I are happily in a relationship, but we're not married and I decided I wanted my child to have my last name (which makes things a lot easier for me!) I was thinking of hyphenating, but the father's last name is already hyphenated, so it would have been really long and cumbersome. My child actually gets really upset when people use the father's last name on mail and stuff. ""That's not my name!""  I can't believe your friend's daughter's situation. WTF?

One last name from the father and one last name from the mother is a great idea. That way, the mother shares a last name with her children without needing to change her last name. My boyfriend still can't use both last names when he buys airplane tickets because ""-"" is an ""invalid function"".  Other times, someone will ask him his last name and to spell it. ""S-M-I-T-H dash C-O-O-L-I-D-G-E.""  ""So your last name is Smith?""  ""No, it's Smith-Coolidge.""  ""Both those are two last names.""  ""Yes, I have two last names. They are both my last names."" He has this conversation a lot.  His sister gets shit from time-to-time for not having the exact same last names as her children. Her children's last names have one last name from their father, and one from their mother, but because it's not exact, she's been stopped at airports (for example: if their last names are Johnson-Smith, and her last name is Smith-Coolidge, they stop her because her last name is not Johnson-Smith. Even though Smith comes from her last name). ""How can we know you're the mother if you don't have the same last name?"" It's absurd that she needs to bring copies of the birth certificates whenever she flies alone with them. One time they almost missed their plane because she didn't have the ORIGINAL COPIES of the birth certificates.

There are often system limitations that simply don't allow for the number of character in a double last name. For example Smith-Jones is usually fine, but Washington-Jefferson is going tout get cut off somewhere. Additionally, did the information get originally put in the system as smith-jones, smith jones,  smithjones, jones-smith, jones smith, jonessmith, smith, jones, and let's pray it isn't smith-jon. It's a real headache for both the customer service rep, and the customer who is stuck waiting on the phone while someone tries variations on their name. Redesigning systems to accommodate the double last name is a huge infrastructure investment with only a minimal return on investment as only a small (but growing)  population does the double last name, and the extra call time for those individuals is cheaper then rebuilding your customer database systems. I recommend always sticking with either maiden name or spouses name on paper. There is nothing wrong with being smith-Jones, but life will be less frustrating if you give your name as Smith or Jones for all customer records or other paperwork.  As for dead beat dad, maiden name all the way, he hasn't earned the right to continue his family name."

If we decide against marriage but still have a similar partnership, I'm okay with either surname. I'm not at all bothered by other people doing it diffrently, it's just my choice.  That said, I wouldn't want my child to have the surname of someone I don't like and who might not be present in their life.

Like they're angry that there are blondes trying to ""pass"" as redheads or something. I don't understand it!  It also like...really, really doesn't apply to this particular woman anyone--her hair is dyed a non-natural shade of red as it is. She's not ""trying to trick"" anybody into thinking she's a natural redhead or something, she probably just liked that color! It's insane."
FemmeThoughts,2nz6e8,SomeOldGoat,116,Tue Dec 2 00:06:04 2014 UTC,"Because they often seem to think that    women fashion every aspect of their appearance around (presumably male) attention women's appearances are a commodity that is being falsely represented by us choosing what we want to do about it. by extension, that anything about us except how we look is irrelevant when considering our value as a partner or a human. women ought to do things like shave their legs and pits and that's not fake or lying but taking creative control over our own body is (with makeup and unnatural hair colours) that it's my fault if a dude looks at me and assumes my eyelids are naturally purple and gold   I mean, there's a list of reasons it bugs me."

But yeah, agree 100%. Also, should point out that a lot of dudes can't tell when a woman is wearing makeup, and don't realise that almost all women are wearing makeup almost all of the time. They have this sick idea that a woman should be beautiful, but naturally and effortlessly beautiful. Like some sort of creepy doll. It's gross."
FemmeThoughts,2nz6e8,hermithome,38,Tue Dec 2 01:38:50 2014 UTC,"Once saw an article in a magazine, something like Cosmo (terrible, I know), that had a Victoria's Secret model with three different levels of makeup, from ""natural"" to ""full face."" They said they polled guys on their favorite look. It pissed me of because the quote they put over this gorgeous woman's ""natural"" look was ""this woman would never attract my attention."" And the full face? ""She looks high maintenance."" For fuck's sake."
FemmeThoughts,2nz6e8,syringa,21,Tue Dec 2 02:42:26 2014 UTC,"I think I saw that.

Women who are too heavily made up are perceived as slutty or trying too hard. Women who aren't made up are perceived as ugly, tired and angry. Both work against them. Not just in romantic situations, in general. Being hired, pay, etc.   Men want women to be pretty, but they don't want women to spend a lot of time or money on their looks. It's ridiculous and sick."

My PhD research is within organisational studies, and we see a lot of these double binds. For example, a woman who speaks up a lot in meetings is often seen as pushy and unfeminine which can seriously harm promotion prospects, whereas women who don't speak up are seen as meek and get overlooked for promotion.

The only reason to shave/notshave, dye your hair or not, get a tattoo/piercing or not, get fake boobs or not, is because you want to.  Here in asia it's a big thing about cosmetic surgery.  ""I wish asian women would stay natural"" is something all the foreign guys say.  Whereas the asian guys all agree that the plastic surgery looks great, and if a woman doesn't get it, she looks ugly (they feel very free to critique peoples' weight, appearance, etc. here).  Really it's your body and your choice to do what you like with it.  I hate that so many women have told me that I look ""gross"" when I started lifting and got swole.

People may get over a depressive episode, but the impact on the brain is permanent. It may or may not be related to his behavior.  Also, he isn't far off with the depression medication making him 'fake'. Depression medication, while it can alleviate depressive symptoms (thereby preventing suicide and making you functional), comes at the price of impacting your emotions in other ways. For instance, people on medication may not be able to 'feel love' in the way they used to, or not at all."

FemmeThoughts,2nz6e8,hollyharlow,22,Tue Dec 2 03:53:31 2014 UTC,"The ones who aren't angry and judgmental don't leave as many comments.  Also, when you read a comment from a thoughtful young man, you are unlikely to recognize it as coming from a young man because he's not obnoxiously declaring his maleness through misogyny.  (Think about what you'd imagine a thoughtful young man to write in response to the /r/aww post.)  Obnoxious comments are like finding a fly in your soup; there's no amount of tasty soup that will make up for a single fly.  And Reddit attracts flies."
FemmeThoughts,2nz6e8,hollyharlow,13,Wed Dec 3 01:38:17 2014 UTC,"It's like this photo posted in r/wtf (I know, I know). It was three photos of women with jewel toned hair, who dyed their armpit hair to match. You can imagine the comments raging on in that thread. It's ridiculous. If some guy wants to grow some crazy facial hair, I don't sit there and judge him on it.   A beard obstructs a clear view of ones face. I would say that is an obstruction of ogling and false advertising!"
FemmeThoughts,2nz6e8,GlassHouseResident,2,Mon Dec 1 23:54:21 2014 UTC,"It was!

FemmeThoughts,2nz6e8,hollyharlow,1 point,Tue Dec 2 06:20:47 2014 UTC,"Years ago in college I wore (clear glass) glasses because I thought they were cute even though I don't need prescription lenses - the frames were two-tone red and black, and they had little snake designs near the hinges. I wore them to class one week and one guy said I looked better with glasses than I had with ""contacts"" -- remember, I don't need eye correction and don't wear contacts, so he basically just said he liked the frames better than my face. I got so self-conscious about it that it still bothers me four years later!"
FemmeThoughts,2nz6e8,beadspritegirl,1 point,Tue Dec 2 13:15:55 2014 UTC,I don't think that necessarily means he liked them better than your face. Some people really do look great in glasses.

FemmeThoughts,2o1nq3,painting_bohemian,4,Tue Dec 2 14:05:44 2014 UTC,"I think that Beyonce is definitely becoming one of the faces of present-day feminism. Ever since her last album dropped, I have been listening to it at least several times a week. What I find funny and upsetting about it is that the common reaction among people I know is they are upset that she was so overtly sexual in this album. They want to accuse her of ""sulting it up"" to sell albums. This really bothers me. Even if you want to use an antiquated idea that women should be virginal, pure, innocent beings until they are married, she meets the criteria. If a 30-something married mother cannot express that she has sex, and enjoys it, who the fuck can?! I also want to laugh because I assume that these folks haven't actually listened to the full album. Particularly to Flawless. I think that song is the perfect response to those kinds of claims. The use of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TED talk and  the line ""We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are."" is absolute perfection. I can't think of a better response. Mind you, I may be a little biased though since her speech resonates so deeply with me and the kinds of daily challenges I navigate in regards to my identity.  Many of her other songs from both her recent album and older work may not be as aggressive about feminism but just how much can you expect from a song? They do however touch on subjects like confidence, independence and the joy of simply being a woman. All of which I think are important to feminism."

Honestly, if it hadn't been for that, I probably would have had to give up breastfeeding much earlier than I did.

Either by family or by the media we consume. They've done study after study showing that people make associations when presented with names that ""look"" a certain way. You pay attention to things differently based on what your own experiences are. So if you can't relate you tend not to care very much about representation or context.   For example, in the US, black people of all ages are perceived and remembered as being larger and older than they actually are. By almost all other ""races"". Where does that come from? Possibly generations of stories portraying the black man as a dangerous and savage beast? And Asians are seen as quiet and studious and intelligent because of similar fed narratives. That's a kind of racism too, though it appears positive. Men are seen as less nurturing than women. Tall people are trusted more than short people. Good looking people are seen as nicer than ugly people. Humans are really bad at recognizing our own biases without constant vigilance, is what I'm getting at..."
FemmeThoughts,2ntrdq,feelingnotgreat,17,Sun Nov 30 06:38:10 2014 UTC,"Hey OP. I've struggled with those things a lot too. Although I don't personally have bipolar, I do have a disorder that mimics it and a lot of people with my condition get diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so I have some idea of what it's like.   I'm going to be honest, I think the ""no one will love you until you love yourself"" crap is bullshit. I got told that once by the girl an ex of mine cheated on me with and it made me angry then and it makes me angry still now. I by no means love myself, but I do accept myself which I think is the biggest thing. I don't love my health or my weight but I accept these aspects of who I am. You've only got one body, so why spend the time actively hating it.   Being an adult student sucks, but you know what? Adult students typically do better than those who are my age (21) doing school because they've done some life. They've had adult relationships, they've had a ""big person"" job. They understand what going to school means and don't just ride on their parents back hoping to just make Cs so they can get the hell out of there. Being an adult student means you most likely appreciate the time being there more. I don't live with my parents, but I live with my SO and his parents because they have a good thing going. They own their house, it's a great location and we get our own area, PLUS we can have pets! Having animals helps me so much. I have 3 cats, and I adore them all.   I don't have a license either. It's just not a thing that I have personally needed. I walk or take the bus as in my country we have good public transport. My SO is 32 and hasn't even set foot behind the wheel because what's the point? I'm probably going to get my license but the only reason I see a reason is if we move into a suburb or start producing spawn. You're certainly not an idiot for it, it's just been a different priority for you, like me.   What aspect of it makes you feel terrible about yourself? Would seeking a better job be a way to combat that?   Being raped doesn't make you terrible at sex. Soooo many women can't orgasm and that's okay. Get to know your body and just zone out and figure out what works for you. Once upon a time vibrators were too much for me, but one day it just happened! You can be great without having sex. I will be blunt, I knew how to give a great blow job before I gave an man one. That's not a high demand for some men, you just gotta find the ones you're sexually compatible with. And often times this means having a few partners before you find the one. It's going to be hard. You went through a traumatic time and many decent person would accept this about you and help you. Getting cervical cancer from sex is a very small risk. You have more of a risk of death by leaving your house. HPV is really just a thing that so many people have who are fine.   Fuck the typical life path. I was expecting to be living the high life and being awesome, but now, I'm still awesome, just doing the small life thing. If you're happy with your life, then fuck the haters, not literally of course. I don't care if people think I'm being lazy - they just don't understand chronic illness and how it works. I'm happy and thats what matters.   Now, for the heavy advice thing. Have you done CBT/DBT? DBT works magic in those with bipolar disorder and BPD. I've personally been through both for my depression and anxiety and doing FOCUSED work on those two has helped a lot. You can ""see"" a therapist but it doesn't mean they will be doing these exact things. If you can find groups doing it then I highly recommend joining. Make your life into a life YOU want to live. Set up YOUR life, fuck other people who think they know how your life should go because they don't. Only you know. Have you been in therapy for the issues you have developed with the history of your rape? It's a hard thing to go through and I can see it's really affecting you and I think it needs some TLC so you can move past your past."

Self esteem, in my experience, isn't a magical thing that happens overnight. I used to have terrible self esteem, to the point of actively hating myself but eventually I came to just a sense of peace with my body and myself. Sometimes I go out and I can still feel the eyes of people on me because I'm big, but I feel like I'm at a point where I just don't care what others think anymore. Like the only people whose opinions matter are mine and the people I deem matters. It's weird because it was never something I actively worked on improving.

FemmeThoughts,2ntrdq,Death2Milk,2,Sun Nov 30 21:00:51 2014 UTC,"My number one advice with meditation is this: don't stress about not thinking. Just let the thoughts come and go. Accept them and then pass them along. Don't focus on them, but if you do focus, then realise when you're doing this and then accept it and pass them along. Meditation isn't easy at first but after a while you can just zone out and it's amazing. I've been so deep in meditation I have physically felt like I was falling over when I was sitting upright. I was just so comfortable in my body.   There's a bajillion smartphone apps out there for mediation so I recommend downloading some and trying them out. I'm a big fan of guided meditation so these kinds of things are right up my alley."

FemmeThoughts,2ntrdq,eliasv,9,Thu Dec 4 07:26:04 2014 UTC,"If you spin things around a bit, sounds like you are on the right track.  1) You are going back to school again to better yourself. That is great!  2) You are getting back on the horse again and trying to move on from the past incident. Time is relative, you are doing it now and that is what counts.  3) You saw going back to school as a positive thing and are taking the steps to reach your goals. Your job is your means to an ends.  4) You are able to self analyse and see how a horrific experience has led to negative thoughts and feelings. You are able to look inside and therefore can move on from this. Plus, ""typical life path"" is never typical, everyone has their own things going on, yet some are better at hiding it, or trying to be better than their neighbour. This is not you and that is ok, you have experiences and will grow from them.  5) You get As in stuff! I never got an A. There will always be those better off and worse off than you. If you always compare yourself to others, it will be harder to be happy. It may not seem it but 30 is still young. You are finding yourself before you settle down and that is ok.  Have you tried a psychologist who specialises in CBT?  You may always have some insecurity, but the aim could be more how to manage it, rather than extinguish it completely.   TLDR: Spin things around and look at things differently, you are on tne right track."

I always get sad when I see stuff like ""a handful is enough"" or stuff about boobs being perky. I've heard it from men too, and I'm only 21 but I've got heavy, saggy H cup boobs with nipples that point down. I dunno, just wish they looked like other 21 year old girls' boobs. I know they're beautiful in their own way and of course they're acceptable and I just have to find a guy who appreciates them for what they are (I have) but I wish I didn't have to. I wish they were just smaller and easier. I wish I didn't have to order expensive bras online that don't fit half of the time. I dunno. Ugh."

FemmeThoughts,2nkbea,meanttolive,7,Thu Nov 27 19:24:47 2014 UTC,"The problem is though, that I don't think that does much. Racism is systemic yes, but people make up that system. There are lots of people who understand that racism is systemic and believe in that, but refuse to believe that they could ever be a part of the problem.    ""The idea of calling it racial bias lessens the blow,"" says Crystal Moten, a history professor at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  ""Do you want to lessen the blow or do you want to eradicate racism? I want to eradicate racism,"" she says. ""Yes I want opportunity for dialogue, but the impact of racism is killing people of color.

And in fact, the protesters stopped people (mostly outsiders) from looting on more than one occasion, while the cops did nothing.   Not to mention the fact that the cops and DA did just about everything in their power to cause the riot. They pushed the announcement off until late in the evening, instead of doing it in the morning and coordinating with the local leaders and clergy. They declared a state of emergency and heavily armed up, in advance. They didn't properly block off streets for the protesters to use. The announcement itself was as inflammatory as humanly possible. They bottled the protesters up and fired tear gas into a crowd, something that you're never supposed to do, because then everyone panics.   Cops have a lot of tools at their disposal to calm shit down. They're trained in how to cool things down and work with the community. They chose to not do the stuff that would have eased tensions, and instead do stuff that would ratchet up tension and violence.   Or just do what everyone else did and go through a mass facebook defriending."

FemmeThoughts,2ng385,FixinThePlanet,5,Thu Nov 27 19:58:02 2014 UTC,"No, not a problem at all, you go right ahead.  You might also want to let them know just how bad racism is in America:   The net worth of the average black household in the United States is $6,314, compared with $110,500 for the average white household, according to 2011 census data. The gap has worsened in the last decade, and the United States now has a greater wealth gap by race than South Africa did during apartheid. (Whites in America on average own almost 18 times as much as blacks; in South Africa in 1970, the ratio was about 15 times.) The black-white income gap is roughly 40 percent greater today than it was in 1967. A black boy born today in the United States has a life expectancy five years shorter than that of a white boy. Black students are significantly less likely to attend schools offering advanced math and science courses than white students. They are three times as likely to be suspended and expelled, setting them up for educational failure. A white man with a felony record is more likely to get a job over a black man with no criminal history. In a classic study on race, psychologists staged an experiment with two photographs that produced a surprising result.  They showed people a photograph of two white men fighting, one unarmed and another holding a knife. Then they showed another photograph, this one of a white man with a knife fighting an unarmed African-American man.  When they asked people to identify the man who was armed in the first picture, most people picked the right one. Yet when they were asked the same question about the second photo, most people -- black and white -- incorrectly said the black man had the knife. Professors at the University of Chicago and MIT sent 5,000 fictitious resumes in response to 1,300 help wanted ads. Each resume listed identical qualifications except for one variation -- some applicants had Anglo-sounding names such as ""Brendan,"" while others had black-sounding names such as ""Jamal."" Applicants with Anglo-sounding names were 50% more likely to get calls for interviews than their black-sounding counterparts.   And there's so much more. Maybe they'll be willing to listen. But if they start sounding like an interview from The Whiteness Project, dump em and run. The Root even wrote an article specifically about dumping FB friends for racism in response to Ferguson"

FemmeThoughts,2nbgml,kip9,35,Tue Nov 25 00:13:35 2014 UTC,"People who view this merely as a case of parents disagreeing over whether or not they should take their child to a salon are missing the point completely.   Going to the salon for a black female should not automatically mean chemically altering her hair texture. There is a problem in society where certain features characteristic of some non-whites are considered to be unacceptable and people possessing these features, especially women, are made to feel less than for having features they were born with. Dark skin and kinky hair are features that many black women have and, since childhood, are given the message that those features are unattractive and should be changed in various ways. These messages are internalized and create complexes in that child.   In a way, it may be akin to the controversy over unrealistic beauty standards for (white) women - that one must have an incredibly thin waist, large hips, large breasts, and long and thin legs as well as blemish-free skin. Children's toys are one way children are exposed to these ideals. This is why ""Normal Barbie"" was created, so that young white girls will begin to see that they can be beautiful without possessing these idealized features.   Aside from these pressures, black girls face additional pressures in that they are made to feel less than because of features common amongst their race. How a parent perceives their child's features can have a more powerful affect on a child than media or toys may ever have. By relaxing and bleaching his daughter's hair, against her mother's will, the father is sending the message that he considers it important that her hair must be bleached and straight. There are allegations that he is adamant that his daughter be considered ""white"" and not ""black"" or mixed with some saying that he responds angrily when anyone refers to his daughter as anything but a ""white"" girl. While it is true that she is mixed, race politics and racial sentiments must be taken into account. With these and other stories, it really makes me question whether or not he is causing harm by repeatedly reminding his daughter that there is something wrong with blackness, something wrong with her hair, and her heritage and that these parts of her must be ignored or changed in order for her to be acceptable.

And that is deeply problematic.   I absolutely agree with this sentiment. The issue of race and racial identity seems to be a huge problem with Aubrey, and there is no way that is not negatively impacting this child. There may be more than than just implied issues of race, too; who knows what he is actually telling her.  It's my understanding Berry has petitioned the court several times in response to the racism and the effect it has on their daughter, but I don't think it's taking it seriously enough. And this ruling seems to treat this issue like parental bickering, rather than something that could be permanently damaging to this little girl.  I cannot believe that there haven't been psychological evaluations with this prolonged custody battle. I think the court is failing its responsibility to this little girl, because I think that telling her that she needs to be ""white"" is tantamount to abuse."
FemmeThoughts,2nbgml,kip9,10,Tue Nov 25 15:26:12 2014 UTC,You're so very right. The judge is not taking this case seriously whatsoever and seems to neglect the long-lasting and damaging psychological impact racial beauty standards and racist influences may have on a child. This has quite a lot to do with the general ignorance on such matters in society in general.
FemmeThoughts,2nbgml,ilwolf,12,Tue Nov 25 15:37:11 2014 UTC,"It's very sad. Normally I would wonder if Berry's lawyer is doing an effective job making the judge aware of the extent of the issue, but given that she can hire any counsel she wants, I have to agree with you, it's likely the judge.  What makes it more upsetting is that we are seeing this case because it is as high-profile as it gets. What happens to biracial and multiracial children in relationships that have broken down and have the animosity expressed in this way in courtrooms across the country? Because I think that is what Aubrey is doing, taking his anger at Berry and aiming it all toward the concept of race. Given that Berry is biracial, he probably knows that racial identity is a sensitive place for her.  It's the court's job to determine the best interests of the children, and I think it's failing in this regard. And if it fails with a case like this one, how about those cases no one is watching?"

FemmeThoughts,2nbgml,SharkWoman,6,Tue Nov 25 09:34:53 2014 UTC,"My vote is for completely unaware.   If you have never had black hair, you typically won't get why this is a big deal. It's like asking why white people feel so okay touching black hair. Plenty won't get why that's even a thing, because to them it's a compliment to be attracted to the purty braids or cushy fluffs, and they like when people make a fuss over their own hair. Kind of like when dudes are like ""Whut, I would like it if a girl shouts sexual stuff at me."" and you just facepalm forever over why don't you get this basic boundary? Because the experience of being in a different body is that profoundly different.   Not being able to relate or understand the issue is just a matter of perspective. I don't feel like the population here is clueless on purpose, they literally do not understand and it'd take some doing to get them to understand why understanding is important. Not meaning to imply it's your responsibility to educate them, but they seem innocent to me rather than dismissive.   I think the crowd here is essentially thoughtful and receptive and also not black, so it's not a rough room, but they can't be relied on to just know how to recognize racist stuff that isn't overt.   You can easily be innocently oblivious to your own lack of perspective taking. Now, how people react to when that ignorance is pointed out, that can be a matter of character."

The stuff I've read in the past and the discussion here today make total sense, it's not hard to understand and I'm sure some white women learnt some interesting and useful stuff today.

Also, it should be noted that a lot of her hair choices are for her work. She generally doesn't get to control what her character looks like. And even the rest of the time, it's not easy to be a black woman with natural hair in Hollywood. She makes whatever choices she wants to, or needs to. And that's fine."
FemmeThoughts,2nbgml,kyleehappiness,31,Tue Nov 25 01:59:01 2014 UTC,"Yes, straightening and dying black hair is an attempt to look more white, more acceptable to the status quo.

The army forbids natural styles for black women for a while, despite how totally impractical the alternatives are in a war zone.  There's a difference between a black woman making a professional and personal choice, and a  white man insisting on his young black daughter straightening and dying her hair. Yeah, it's an attempt to make her look more white.   Halle's hair, and her choices are irrelevant to this situation.  Edit: tenses are hard"

I've always found it baffling when some men claim that women do it for them. It's like WAT RELY!?! Because I'm damn sure some of them can't tell the difference between brands and top coats. My SO only knows so much about it because I go on and on about polish and what I want and ""omg it's so pretty I NEED DIS"". He's actually quite good at recognizing some of them but he's the only man who I give a shit abouts opinion. And don't get me started on men who think red polish means that ""you're a whore or slut"".   Someone in the comments section said this:    THIS is why the Revlon ads with the disembodied hands over the dudes' faces, and the quotes from dudes about color, drive me crazy. Nail polish is fun (partly) because I'm not being relentlessly mansplained about it; I don't need that from Revlon.   And I can't agree more with this. Nail polish is the only thing I don't have men yelling at me (theoretically) about. Just look at a MUA thread when it hits /r/all. It becomes a cesspit of ""you're beautiful without makeup"" and ""eww my boner doesn't like this""."
FemmeThoughts,2n9ujv,dedededede,0,Mon Nov 24 16:21:59 2014 UTC,"Nice article. I think nail art can look really cool, as a young boy in kindergarten I loved having colored nails or doing manicure with my grandma.  Yet, to me, nail art has some ethical baggage (like most fashion stuff that has roots in ancient times). Especially long nails used to symbolize that you don't have to work with your hands, it's a very old status symbol of being rich and having servants. I think especially in Eastern and African cultures this meaning is still very present (interesting read in this regard: Why Chinese Men Grow Long Fingernails). In this context it was/is a status symbol for men being able to ""afford a wife"" with long finger nails.  In the age of washing machines and consumerism a curvaceous body and long nails are suddenly relatively easy to achieve. I think this is why nail art became somewhat associated with ""faking it"" in Western countries (especially in context of racial prejudices).  Nevertheless in the age of automation and knowledge workers we should be able to transform this artful fashion into something that allows to present a statement of individual expression than of social class."

FemmeThoughts,2n9ujv,lollibut,2,Mon Nov 24 18:11:27 2014 UTC,"Oddly enough nail art was really popular amongst white teens in Australia (probably also America, but I've no personal experience there)  in the 1970s. There was less variety in products of course (true of everything in the 70's)  and they were more expensive compared to the average hourly wage, but still nail art was huge. My older sister had dozens of nailpolishes and transfers, her and her friends would get together and do their nails in all sorts of different ways and grab my toddler self and do my nails too for practice.   Then the eighties and its peculiar attitude to a bunch of stuff hit us, and pfffft, anything that wasn't bright red or pink talons or au naturale or black for goths disappeared from our style consciousness for years until some time later french manicures became a thing again. Then more colours and more sophisticated techniques started filtering back in to the white mainstream fashions.  Makes me want to look at the 80's with a more critical eye... since whatever happened then with white people obviously didn't happen that way to PoC."

So much violence in the media is blamed on mental illness which I won't deny is sometimes a factor in violence but would argue is only one aspect of it.  Killing sprees for example are nearly entirely perpetuated by men who sometimes do have mental illnesses. However women suffer from mental illness rates of roughly the same as men, where are all the women going out and shooting people?

I think an argument can be made for reasons why weight matters in physical fitness, and why a gym teacher might need to know it (if you're pairing up kids for different types of sports, weight does matter), but for the express purpose of determining obesity?

Even though they're fun and innocent and would be awesome in a family photo album to look back on later... too many creeps can see them if you post them on the internet. And it's those creeps sexualizing your child that you have to worry about and protect your child's images from."
FemmeThoughts,2n0shm,trainofthought700,22,Fri Nov 21 21:38:08 2014 UTC,"I absolutely understand what you are saying and I think I personally am a bit torn on the issue... maybe I agree most with the lawyer in the video. However, I take issue with an artist being held accountable for not censoring themselves due to fear of creeps. There is clearly no intent by this man to sexualize his child and I personally don't see anything sexual (other than nakedness) in the images either. Why is it his responsibility to keep others from being creeps? He didn't ask for, intend, or even think about that these could be seen as sexual images. It feels a bit reminiscent of  ""what were you wearing when you were raped?"", you know? If she is in jeans and a long sleeve shirt it is ok, but anything less (a bikini, underwear, naked?) then of course you should expect your child to be sexualized and we can make judgements about your morality and ability to parent.    There is zero intent or consent. The fault lies entirely with the person sexualizing the child because a child, naked or not, is not inherently sexual. It isn't fair to place adult connotations of sexuality on children. They are in the wrong; not a dad sharing family photos."
FemmeThoughts,2n0shm,allrattedup,21,Fri Nov 21 22:26:16 2014 UTC,"I take issue with an artist being held accountable for not censoring themselves due to fear of creeps.   It's less ""fear of creeps"" and more privacy. There's always a fine line to walk when it comes to sharing photos of children on the internet (regardless of the context), and plenty of moms have gotten flack for blogging about their children and posting pictures of them, simply because it's an legitimate issue of privacy.  The concept of public and private online really changes how we do and see things. To your point, yes, the creep factor is a level of fear mongering bullshit that I also dislike, but the privacy issue is often overlooked, and I think actually fuels a lot of the ""creep"" argument.   Kids can't understand the ramifications of having their pictures online. They don't control it, they can't consent to it. Parents have a responsibility to protect their kids and shield them. Maintaining a child's privacy is part of that responsibility. The problem is we don't really understand where to draw the line yet - hell, plenty of us don't understand how private (or not private) stuff on the internet is.   All of this stuff is incredibly new, and we're not all that good at articulating ourselves to begin with, but when we're placed in a position of public outrage, any eloquence goes out the window, and arguments get boiled down to ""PEDOPHILES!"" instead of a well-reasoned, rational argument about privacy and ethics and parental responsibility."
FemmeThoughts,2n0shm,g1i,15,Sat Nov 22 00:16:51 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the guy definitely has a responsibility to respect his daughter's privacy, since she can't meaningfully consent to the photos, them being posted online, any of it. Especially since those photos will be there for the rest of her life."
FemmeThoughts,2n0shm,so_srs,10,Sat Nov 22 00:29:00 2014 UTC,"Exactly. And as adorable an normal and human as they are (and they are), they're private unless and until she is old enough to share them, and chooses to do so."
FemmeThoughts,2n0shm,g1i,-5,Sat Nov 22 01:26:41 2014 UTC,"Welp, I guess we should all stop putting family photos up on Facebook under any circumstances, then."
FemmeThoughts,2n0shm,eliasv,6,Sat Nov 22 11:56:20 2014 UTC,I'd hope you'd give thought to who the photos are being shared with and where they're likely to end up.
FemmeThoughts,2n0shm,so_srs,3,Sat Nov 22 21:12:26 2014 UTC,"Fair points all around.   As far as privacy and consent are concerned I think we have to remember that as a parent he has the ability to consent for her in this situation. It isn't much different than if a random photographer had come up and asked if he could take her picture and he, as the father, consented for her. As her guardian that is his right and it is legal as long as it isn't pornographic and meant to titillate. Which it clearly isn't in this case. Same with famous children, either  actors, models, or simply having famous parents, who obviously lack privacy due to their situation that their parents chose for them. He has chosen a life of public documentation for his children but I really don't think mommy bloggers are getting such explicit and distasteful commentary for doing the same thing. Is this outrage simply because he is a man? If they had been posted under his wife's account would it have been deleted? There are so many facets to this story; I personally find it fascinating on so many levels.  Like I said, I am definitely torn on the issue and you hit the nail on the head with the lack of eloquence and rational argument being a major part of that. We can't have a rational argument about the ethics of using your child as an artistic subject for the world to see when the dissent is coming from someone with the username ""TitWitch"" telling you that people are jacking off to your two year old.   And I admittedly have a slightly skewed perspective being a liberal, childfree artist myself. I really love the artistic statement he is making and the conversation he is facilitating with the show"
FemmeThoughts,2n0shm,allrattedup,12,Sat Nov 22 02:53:50 2014 UTC,"I think we have to remember that as a parent he has the ability to consent for her in this situation   Yes, he does, but that's why he's getting flak. It's a question of judgement and while he is an artist and the sentiment is lovely, the fact that the whole world is watching and she doesn't have any say or concept of it is what troubles people, I think. I know I'd be damned upset if I was famous as a toddler for messing around naked. It's just not something I'd want to be known for, especially as something I don't remember and didn't have any say in.   She might not give a fuck as she gets older, either, but it's the lack of choice that's alarming. Essentially, he should know better.   It isn't much different than if a random photographer had come up and asked if he could take her picture and he, as the father, consented for her.   It is, though, and here's why:    Dad consenting for her probably wouldn't be intimate, personal portraits of his kid being a kid at that time in her life. They'd probably be a one-off shot, or a shoot for a specific purpose, like a newspaper story or a circular ad.  It would be extremely unlikely that the photo would shoot to such fame / controversy.     Same with famous children, either actors, models, or simply having famous parents, who obviously lack privacy due to their situation that their parents chose for them.   Actually, there are laws that specifically protect kids of famous people. Because they are kids. Likewise, could you imagine the criminal cases if someone took intimate family photos of children and published them without the family's consent, or stole existing intimate family photos of kids? Yeah, no.   He has chosen a life of public documentation for his children but I really don't think mommy bloggers are getting such explicit and distasteful commentary for doing the same thing. Is this outrage simply because he is a man?   I don't think so. I know Dooce got a ton of shit (and plenty of other mommy bloggers have as well), about posting pictures of her kids. It's been called exploitative, irresponsible and unethical in addition to all the pedophilia fear mongering that's always thrown into the mix.   We can't have a rational argument about the ethics of using your child as an artistic subject for the world to see when the dissent is coming from someone with the username ""TitWitch"" telling you that people are jacking off to your two year old.   I think the sentiment is apt, though, even if it's sensationalized. The truth is that with this level of instantaneous exposure, this kid is just out there. The issue of a pedophile jerkin' it to family portraits is up there with being momentarily grossed out at the idea that someone might have jerked it to a picture of me from facebook. Does it directly harm me in any way? Not even remotely. Is it kind of skeevy to think about? Sure, but there are way skeevier things out there, and I wouldn't want to get into the business of thought-policing people, and that's where I draw the line with all the pedophilia bullshit.   What can very directly hurt that kid, though, is the lack of control over her own image, the lack of privacy she may feel, and public knowledge of her intimate childhood moments. That's the bottom line - her pictures are out there, and friends, family, bullies, future boyfriends, teachers, friends' parents, the lady at the supermarket - everyone she might meet could potentially know and have an opinion about her underwear dancin' days.   And that kind of sucks. It kind of sucks major big time, because she didn't get any sort of a say.   And I admittedly have a slightly skewed perspective being a liberal, childfree artist myself. I really love the artistic statement he is making and the conversation he is facilitating with the show   I think that's the nail on the head, though. The fact that he's using his kid to create a conversation that is controversial. Do I agree with the underlying message? Sure, but I don't like the way his kid is being exploited to make a point."
FemmeThoughts,2n0shm,g1i,1 point,Sat Nov 22 04:02:17 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your perspective, I just don't see it as negatively as your examples. I see it as largely harmless and I would imagine that a child brought up in the environment where her nakedness, the photographing and sharing of which, is seen as natural and a non-issue would likely feel the same as an adult.    The fact that he's using his kid to create a conversation that is controversial. Do I agree with the underlying message? Sure, but I don't like the way his kid is being exploited to make a point.   I understood that he posted them not expecting any sort of conversation and the one lobbied against him was centered around pedophilia and how shitty of a parent he is.   He made a choice to share it and then a choice to stand by it and make a counter statement. Even if I don't agree with either of those choices (and I am not sure that I would have done the same thing) I don't think he deserves the vilification he received.   At the very least he did start a conversation that could change the way we think about internet privacy and maybe even nakedness and unwarranted sexualization. I'll be honest, I hadn't thought  deeply about these issues prior to this conversation."
FemmeThoughts,2n0shm,allrattedup,3,Sat Nov 22 04:23:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah I totally agree with what you're saying. In no way should we blame the dad or the child for what other people do with those images. If you put pictures of your children on the Internet you aren't ""asking for"" child predators to sexualize them. He shouldn't have to censor himself like that... in an ideal world no one would take pictures of children and turn them into something sexual.   I hate that he has to hide those joyful pictures of childhood to prevent perverts from sexualizing his child. It is so not okay. But there's no way he can prevent them from doing it other than not posting them online in a public forum. He should absolutely be able to post them, but I don't think he can trust the Internet with those photos of his child."

I mean, we live in an imperfect world. It's prudent to do some basic things to prevent your life from sucking. Except in this case, he's using his 2 year old daughter to prove a point. If she were old enough to understand and consent to being used to prove a principal, fine, but I assure you I would never post pictures like this of my children on the public internet.

But you can also think of it in terms of what it takes to change the culture itself, so that the Xaynie of a more 'mature' culture would look back on naked photographs as one would look back on brushing ones teeth, namely trivially. Perhaps this could be done by having people release stuff like this frequently, perhaps at some initial cost, but for the long term good of society so that it becomes normal and accepted. Of course, underlying any change like this would require society to stop idolizing sexuality.  Alternatively, he could have waited to release the collection until she was older."

Sally Mann is a renown photographer who stirred up a storm when one of her collections, Immediate Family, included pictures of her children naked.   The way that she approached the issue of releasing the collection was that she decided to wait till about 10 years later when her kids grew out of their old bodies, so to speak. Her children actually disagreed and the collection was released early. The kids removed any photographs that they didn't want in the collection.  A lot of conservative folks got really angry about it and decried it as child pornography.  Perhaps Wyatt could have waited to release the collection. Sally's argument was that she was going to release when her kids had ""grown out of their bodies"". Since his daughter is so young, by the time she comes of age to care about the photographs, she already will have grown out of her body, so perhaps it doesn't really matter."

So you'll have to start smaller with something you do believe. It can be as simple as, ""I love my hair color"" or ""I'm doing really well in this class"" or ""I'm proud of how I handled that terrible customer at work.""   Also, realize that the goalposts aren't as far away as they seem.  Sites like Facebook distort the average happiness level of your friends because people only post about good or noteworthy things. They aren't going to post about the mediocre day they are having. They might post about the one good thing that happened during an otherwise mediocre day.  And events like weddings or the birth of babies might get 100 posts so that outweighs weeks or months of regular posts.   Another thing is accepting compliments.  For instance, if someone says, ""Your hair looks really good today,"" but you don't believe it, your thought process might go something like this: ""My hair actually looks worse than usual today. They must be trying to make me feel better. Do I look that terrible that someone is trying to make me feel better?  Or is my usual hairstyle really actually ugly? Or do they want something from me and so are trying to get me in a good mood first?"" So after hearing a compliment you might be dwelling on a bunch of negative things and feel worse than before.   Next time someone gives you a compliment, smile at them as naturally as you can, and say, ""Thank you!""  Realize that even if you don't agree with what they said, they are entitled to their opinion.  Try to see yourself through their eyes to understand where the compliment is coming from.  Understand that even if they were doing it to make you feel better, that just means they care about your feelings, and that you matter to them.   There are a couple of ""fake it"" strategies that actually do make a difference. Smiling and walking tall help me.  You don't need to do it all the time.  When you first see someone you know, give them a smile.  When you first enter a room, walk like a queen with your head up and your shoulders back (even if your have to tell yourself, ""Today I am queen of this cash register""). With practice it will feel more natural.  And another thing that may help is dressing in ways that make you feel more confident. A nicer pair of shoes or a favorite piece of jewelry can help.  Good luck!  It can be very difficult to change negative thought patterns.  But be patient and you'll get there."

FemmeThoughts,2ma9nk,FreyjaSunshine,5,Sat Nov 15 03:01:37 2014 UTC,"Awesome mission!  When I separated from my abusive ex-husband 3 1/2 years ago, I was a shattered mess with no self esteem at all.  None.  Zero.  I knew I had to fix that, and it did take a lot of work, but it was totally worth it.  Here's what I did:   Talk to yourself.  Talk to that little girl inside and tell her exactly what you'd tell any little girl who isn't you.  Tell here she's smart, that she's capable of amazing things, that she deserves to be loved.  Praise her for her accomplishments.  Assure her that her failures are temporary setbacks, and are not a reflection on who she is as a person.  I did this constantly for weeks, but I was very broken. Accept what you tell yourself in #1. Learn to accept compliments.  If someone tells you that you look nice, don't downplay it, say ""Thank you"" and smile. That's it.  So many times, we refuse to accept nice things that others say.  Compliments do not need to be answered with explanations, or excuses, or anything other than a Thank You. Figure out what you like and don't like on your own.  Music, clothes, activities, food, etc.  Whatever those things are, embrace them.  Don't worry about what's popular or trendy, or what other people will think about your choices.  Be you, and not only will other people respect you for that, you can respect yourself for it. Replace unhealthy thoughts with healthy ones.  If you mess up, don't say to yourself, ""I'm so stupid"", replace it with, ""That's a shitty inconvenience"" or whatever applies.  Take yourself out if it.  No need to mentally beat yourself up.   Hope that helps.  It 's worked for me.  I went from being a suicidal mess to a confident, kickass woman.  It takes a lot of work, though.  You're totally deserving of healthy self-esteem.  Go out there and make it happen!"

FemmeThoughts,2ma9nk,MarthaGail,5,Sun Nov 16 22:05:14 2014 UTC,"I think a lot of women struggle with imposter syndrome.   The feeling that they've accomplished things through lies or not really on their own talents. For example, being a manager after completing a degree. Women feel like they didn't complete that degree purely on their own merits, etc etc etc.   I think thats something that could be addressed worldwide, if I'm honest.   That said, I really don't know how to get excellent self esteem, if you do please tell me C:"
FemmeThoughts,2ma9nk,WizardofStaz,4,Fri Nov 14 15:20:06 2014 UTC,"I'm always overly critical of my work. Faking it until I make it makes me feel like a perpetual failure. Instead, I focus on how my work is kickass and not caring so much of my perception of how it'll be received. I actually preform quite a bit better when I don't care as much about the end result so I try to focus on a ""fuck it"" kind of a mentality when it comes to responsibilities, which really seems opposite of what I should do. It weighs less heavily on my mind and I end up having mental resources for more. I treat my body better and gain a lot of confidence from it all.   Positive self talk really works too. Studies that I'm too lazy to look up have shown that telling yourself you love and accept yourself actually has a real affect. Tell yourself that stuff every day, particularly when you feel in the dumps. Ex.: ""Even though..[something bothering you]..I deeply and completely accept myself."" ""You can do it!"" ""Great job!"" ""Just one more and you're through!"" ""You've got this!""  Try rewriting your insecurities to acknowledge the needs that are causing them. For example, I'm afraid of being disliked by other people, but that's because I have a need to feel cared about. When you feel the fear or anxiety, think about the need behind it and focus on fulfilling it. It feels a lot better to have something to work towards instead of feeling vulnerable. You shift the power from other people to yourself. Instead of feeling stressed out because one person doesn't want to spend time with me, I feel loved when I can name many people who care about me."

FemmeThoughts,2ma6w9,kindalikethat,7,Fri Nov 14 13:37:12 2014 UTC,"When I start getting overwhelmed, it helps me to write down the things that keep popping up in my head. If I have a lot of tasks to do, I sometimes end up running through them in my head over and over again instead of getting anything done.  If I write it down, I know I won't forget it and it will get done. It's also nice to be able to check things off the list as you go along."
FemmeThoughts,2ma6w9,daughter11,1 point,Fri Nov 14 14:52:58 2014 UTC,"that's excellent advice, thank you.  Do you mean write them down and make a list? I tried doing that as of yesterday - it made me feel a bit better - maybe I just need to give it time to work!"
FemmeThoughts,2ma6w9,daughter11,3,Fri Nov 14 15:25:42 2014 UTC,"Yep, I basically cope by creating to do lists and writing down all due dates/events on my phone's calendar. It can sometimes seem overwhelming to see them all there in one place but at the same time, I feel more empowered knowing exactly what's going to be happening. Usually I can look at how everything lines up/estimate how long tasks will take and realize that it's really not as bad as I was anticipating.  This also helps for recurring/spiraling thoughts. Once they are on paper, I feel like it is ''okay'' for me to stop repeating through them. I can also go back later when I'm feeling less anxious and review them to see if they are real concerns or just emotional reasoning kinda problems.  If you're doing CBT, your psychologist should be making similar suggestions. There are also good anxiety work books out there with these kind of tips."
FemmeThoughts,2ma6w9,pakap,6,Fri Nov 14 18:00:49 2014 UTC,"Everybody else here has given you some great advice to manage the stressful stuff. I just wanted to add one thing: don't compare your rushes with everybody's highlight reels. The people around you who are on top of everything and juggle all their daily tasks with complete ease? They get stressed out too, and sometimes they fuck up or give up. Sometimes they get behind on stuff. Sometimes they just say ""fuck it"" and eat rice for a week because they can't be arsed to go shopping. You just don't see it because you're not in their shoes :)  So relax: you're normal. You can do this. You'll never be perfect, but no one is."
FemmeThoughts,2ma6w9,coreythestar,3,Sat Nov 15 17:09:01 2014 UTC,"Remember that you can only attend to one thing at a time. Are you over-committing yourself to things that you can't realistically commit to? Do you need to learn how to say no when people ask you to do things?  List making has always helped me when I feel overwhelmed. I have a good calendar in my phone that links with google calendars and I have another calendar on my wall, and everything important goes in there. It takes a while to get used to that kind of life management but once you're accustomed to it it's really helpful.  Also, sometimes the best way to cope really is to crawl under a blanket and sleep reality away for a little while. Allow yourself those discretionary escapes from life, be kind and forgiving, and move on!!  But I can't stress enough: You can only do one thing at a time. If you focus on how many things you have to do it is easy to get overwhelmed and do nothing. If you pick one thing - the easiest, the hardest, the fastest, whatever - and do it without worrying about all the other things, you're already ahead of the game."
FemmeThoughts,2ma6w9,layoxx,2,Sat Nov 15 03:10:10 2014 UTC,"I constantly take notes and I try to keep a structured day. When I wake up I spend the first hour writing down my expectations for the day, first in one big list of everything, then separated into sections. Which things are mandatory and which can be dropped if I run out of time. Which things need to be done before other things can be done. This lets me focus on one thing at a time, because I already know that the other things will get taken care of afterwards.  If I am feeling really anxious I block out my day into hour chunks. Such as: From 8-9 I will work on e-mails. From 9-10 I will program, etc.   If I am overwhelmed on a project I write a focused Spec Doc. This includes:    Goals I hope to achieve  Design Sketch (If applicable) Requirements Available time for work Projected timeframe   Finally I make sure, always, to include meals, gaming/TV/Other time and social events on my to-do list. Dinner is at the same priority level as writing a paper. Friends are the same tier as client work, etc. This lets me have that helpful 'ahh' moment of accomplishment where I cross everything off my list.  If my day is just:    Breakfast TV Shopping Lunch  Boyfriend hangout Dinner Movie   I can still cross all of those things off, and feel like my day has been worth while. The crossing off is a moment of reflection that I am accomplishing self-maintenance tasks, and it's not all about work and production.   (I am a workaholic if you can not tell, driven largely by anxiety)"
FemmeThoughts,2ma6w9,alaskafound,1 point,Fri Nov 14 21:39:02 2014 UTC,"I used to be like this. The anxiety was awful. I started keeping a journal/planner - I would organize my anxieties about things I needed to do into to do lists and purge racing thoughts from my mind before I fell asleep. I still do these things. And I still get stressed and anxious from time to time, but it's condensed - it's out of my head most of the time and carried around on the pages of this book.   Mind you, If I lost the journal/planner id lose my shit. But it helps so so much to get it out of your head and onto the paper. Especially before bed. If my stresses are keeping me awake, I'll have what I call a ""brainstorm"" session and just jot down everything that is bothering me and just get it out!!  Good luck!"
FemmeThoughts,2ma6w9,alaskafound,1 point,Fri Nov 14 14:53:21 2014 UTC,that sounds great! do you mean that you sort of dumped all the thoughts on a piece of paper and then made a to do list?

If you follow this uproar, the difference has not been so much about the politics of breastfeeding as it is the politics of being a young mother.  The breastfeeding Black mother has been called a whore, sexually irresponsible, etc for being perceived as having a baby at a young age.  Having her boob out is just ""proof"" of her promiscuity.  The other woman is just a beautiful mom in a beautiful, inspirational photo.

The groom is in the right side of the frame, the bride to the left of the frame crying emphatically.  There is no discernable narrative, but over the course of the 26 second video, the bride is visibly held in place by as many as six attendees while shouting in distress [comments on the video indicate the bride is yelling 'bedaa ma' over and over again. The same commentor indicates this means 'I don't want (this), mom' in Kannada] and having rice showered upon her while the groom attempts to place something over her neck and finalize the ceremony.

FemmeThoughts,2lo9ye,FixinThePlanet,2,Sat Nov 8 16:18:41 2014 UTC,It's pretty awful but I can see it from another view. You know when you're out and you should tell people just incase you don't return.  Or maybe I'm just assuming its for a somewhat positive thing since the men have no boundaries and they can't stop them but they can try to at least look out for the young women getting an education.
FemmeThoughts,2lnqha,miscreantpossum,3,Sat Nov 8 07:56:46 2014 UTC,"This year my depression progressed to the point where I thought about suicide almost every day. It seemed like the only way out, the only way to escape the daily agony, hours of crying into my pillow, hurting myself just to push it all away, the compromises, the failures, and lying about it all to everyone I love. It'd be fair to say this has been the worst year of my life.  Eventually I realized with some certainty that I wouldn't live to see 2015 if I didn't do something, and on one of my better days that thought scared me enough to get help. I've been in cognitive therapy for eight weeks now, and on an SSRI for two. My world is starting to look a little less grey every day. I didn't think it was possible before, but I can see now that it can get better, and it will."
FemmeThoughts,2lnqha,ResistEntropy,3,Sat Nov 8 21:11:37 2014 UTC,"I'm glad to see mental illness becoming a less taboo subject. It took me almost 20 years to get treatment for my depression because my parents were extremely ignorant about modern psychology/psychiatry, and I didn't know where to turn.  Greater awareness would keep people from suffering like I did.  That being said, I get a little miffed when people conflate adjustment disorder with major depression. Dealing with a high stress situation is rough and may require professional help, but it's not the same thing as a chronic condition.    Similarly, I hate it when people talk about ""overcoming"" chronic conditions.  Overcoming implies that people can try really hard and be healed, which isn't the case.  Some people can lead full, productive lives, but their conditions will always need management.  And people who can't cope aren't weak or lazy, they just have a more severe illness and/or less help.  It's one of those things people say when they're trying to be nice, but it's actually kind of disingenuous and ableist."

I myself have chronic depression which gets aggravated by situational depression. They are both very different thing.   And fuck yes. In my opinion I'm always going to have depression but it's in remission at this current time. It could flare up again, I don't know. I'm never going to be ""cured"" of it. It's something we have to work on for the rest of our lives. And thats a good point you make about it being ableist."

I hate how society views mental illness as this great evil none shall talk about when even the people we look up to suffer from the same things we do. It's so important to get the help you need and heal from this. There was a time when even thinking about living without my depression made me want to cry and hide myself away, but now, less than 6 months on, I can say that I'm happy. I no longer live my life ruled by my depression."
FemmeThoughts,2lj2ak,meldolphin,16,Fri Nov 7 00:13:06 2014 UTC,"As a feminist writer, this is what I’m expected to do now: explode moments and bodies into viral sensations as protest, activism and empowerment.  the Jezebelification of feminism, which is to say a deluge of pop culture think pieces that are heavy on celebrity voyeurism as analysis and righteous anger as activism over Photoshop clicks, while sparing no keystroke to knock Lena Dunham down a peg for daring to turn herself into a cool girl when she’s obviously a frumpy nobody.  Feminists could learn a few things about what appears to be impossible and what actually is, and that would be — nothing. The LGBTQ movement is the only civil rights and social justice cause that’s not only held their gains from the previous century, but added to them. In the past decade while LGBTQ activists have gained open service in the military, the end of DOMA, federal benefits for same-sex couples and an astonishing sea change of public support–55% of Americans now support same-sex marriage, yet feminists have witnessed the erosion of contraception access, a college rape epidemic, crushing poverty, zero gains for mothers in flex/paid time off and subsidized child care, and more restrictions on abortion between 2011 and 2013 than the previous decade. Nouvea riche feminism glosses over the lack of systematic change like a Kardashian Instagram filter. But the fact remains that it’s hard out there for a woman."

FemmeThoughts,2lj2ak,thesecondkira,10,Fri Nov 7 12:42:45 2014 UTC,"I think you're absolutely right about that. White men listen to other white men and they're the ones with the real socio-political power to implement change. My bf and I were talking about this very thing last night. I was thinking that we haven't come very far in the last 20 years (I was speaking in general, but with an emphasis on women) and he said that we really have made a lot of progress and he cited the strides the LGBTQ community has made. This article really puts pop feminism in perspective for me and makes me wonder what's really going on with us? Why can't we make the same progress as LGBTQ people have? I really think the fact that white men have spear headed progress for LGBTQ makes a huge difference for them."

FemmeThoughts,2lj2ak,thesecondkira,7,Fri Nov 7 16:37:21 2014 UTC,"I think it's a bit odd to brush aside the impact white gay men had in progressing the LGBTQ movement's rights. Do you remember the swath of suicides that led to the ""It Gets Better"" campaign run by Dan Savage(another white, gay male)?  Do you remember how it focused almost solely on the young men and boys who committed suicide, and largely ignored the four lesbians who committed suicide in that time period, as well as the young trans woman who did as well?  Do you remember that the majority of 'socially acceptable' gay couples in the media were white gay men? I mean, Ellen was basically an island during that decade of rights advances, being the only lesbian who seemed to have any sort of pull.  I know that a fantastic amount of LGBTQ people of all types fought terribly hard for rights, and still are...but IMO, a fair bit of the reason we are where we are is because of white (middle/upper class) gay men's ability to persuade USA that they're entirely normal and just like them, because homonormativity really was key in rights advances. And it's very much still a problematic issue in policing who are the good, acceptable LGBTQ people, and who aren't.   Just because we can acknowledge the sexist practices of western society in its relation to the advancement of LGBTQ rights, doesn't mean that feminism isn't getting shit done because men aren't leading the charge. Feminism IS making advances, it's just that women aren't listened to with the same respect that men are, and as another feminist I'm sure you're aware of the plethora of studies that have shown this time and time again.  No one's saying anything new here."

First of all...isn't it a scientifically established fact that men and women experience temps differently? So being hot or cold at 68 degrees isn't a personal flaw. It's just how it is.   Being that I'm very sensitive to cold, yes...I'm always covered up! I completely understand that most people are not like me. But when my lips are turning blue and I'm sore from clenching my muscles, I feel helpless and sad.  Over the summer at work, our office was 57 degrees every day because of construction on our water system. It was like a meat locker. Now, the hot water is below our office and can't be pumped upwards (wtf? Because we won't need heat during this year's polar vortex?), so it's about 68.

FemmeThoughts,2lcki3,favesweater,8,Wed Nov 5 07:38:42 2014 UTC,"Also, working on your mental health with a therapist makes you more aware of your feelings and I have noticed an unfortunate side effect: I used to be able to conveniently REPRESS my feelings, but now I cannot, and they are hard to deal with - I feel like an emotional roller coaster all day long.   OMG, so true!   I don't know what to do. I used to be charismatic and I used ot know how to make friends easily. I used to not be on an emotional roller coaster. I used to have better self esteem. I dont know how to remedy these things.   It's a slow process, unfortunately. :-/    Story time: I popped my anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in 1996. I went to the doctor, and was misdiagnosed with a sprained knee. I was advised to RICE it and take 600 mg. Ibuprofen a day.  Six months later, with my knee still hurting, I went to another doctor. I was told I needed to rest it more and take more Ibuprofen.  For three years, I couldn't run because my knee hurt too much. I had to be careful walking down stairs or it would slip. I lost strength and gained weight due to my impairment.  Finally, I got an accurate diagnosis. I got some physical therapy that made my other knee stronger and less painful. Yay! Then I had reconstruction surgery.   For two weeks after the surgery, my leg was in a brace that locked my knee straight. I was on crutches and couldn't put any weight on it. I lost a ton of muscle mass.  Then I got the brace adjusted so I could bend my knee about 20 degrees. I started physical therapy to rebuild lost muscle and regain lost range of motion. PT was painful and difficult. From the time I got out of surgery until about three months later, I was worse off than I was when I went into surgery.  But it got better. I got stronger. SLOWLY. I regained full range of motion. SLOWLY. And it was painful, hard work. I had to drag myself around on an office chair just using my one leg to rebuild my hamstrings. I had to balance for a minute on a rocking platform. I had to do all kinds of stuff that was uncomfortable and painful. But it helped. Little by little.  One day, about four months after surgery, I saw my bus coming and ran 20 feet to catch it. I ran, for the first time in YEARS. It felt amazing.  It was still less than I'd been doing right before I popped that ligament, but it meant I was getting there. It meant I was healing. It meant I was mostly a whole person again.  But if I'd hopped out of the surgical bed and tried to run? I would have just crippled myself. Never mind that, I simply couldn't have; I didn't have the range of motion anymore. I'd had it before. I would have it again. But right then, I didn't. I still had healing to do, and for a while, I was worse off than I was before the procedure.  It was incredibly frustrating to be so limited. It was depressing and disheartening. But I kept working at it, with help from an awesome PT team and a good orthopedic surgeon, and little by little I got better.   Does that help? You're on the road to recovery, but it's normal when you go and address a major issue to get worse before you get better. We totally get this when it comes to physical ailments, but when it comes to mental health, we're so much less forgiving of ourselves. Maybe because it hurts in a way that is intensely private and incredibly difficult to mitigate; the drugs that will dull that psychic ache do so much more, and make you so much less. But you're doing what you need to do to get better, and it will get less painful.   It's important to challenge yourself and practice new skills, but also important not to push yourself so hard that you re-injure healing parts of you. Work with your therapist on this, be kind to yourself, and celebrate the little victories. You'll make friends again, maybe soon. The pain is real and important, but also not a life sentence."

Tell people how you almost missed the bus, that your sister called, that there is a new movie that you wanna go see (and while you're at it, ask them if they want to join!), ask them about that thing from class you didn't quite understand or the funny thing your professor do. And like, REALLY pretend that this is things that you want to talk about and that you care about. People love to talk about themselves, so ask. What are they doing for christmas, or the weekend, or whatever. Ask them where they're from or what they did before school.  That's what I do. It's hard, even though it's not much. But I have found that it helps to really smile when you say ""hello"" to people. Small steps, I guess. Maybe one day we will both be charm-queens again!  Also try to think about the other persons body language. Just mimicking what they do is a great way to form a connection. Like, if someone scratches their nose, you scratch your nose (but maybe a couple of seconds after so it wont seem weird). There is lots of books on this if you want more tips =)  And sorry for my English, it's not my first language and I'm a bit out of practice =)"

I'm not sure about a long-term solution, but something that's been helping is showing up early to class and making myself chat with everyone. It's pretty low-stress, everyone is willing to chit-chat, and you are guaranteed to have something in common (the class)!

I got angry and started trying to become a person who he would regret rejecting.  I started working out, volunteered, worked on creative projects, and picked up archery.  Through all of that, I got over him but gained a ton of self esteem for the first time in my life.  I'm not saying working on yourself because you're angry over a lover is the best idea, but at this point in my life it doesn't matter.  Become a person you yourself would want to be friends with.  I guarantee you will start attracting friends and feel better about yourself!"

You don't have to explain anything, but send them a message like, ""Hey! Haven't seen you in awhile. Want to get coffee Saturday morning?"" And suggest a time! A specific one! Making/rekindling friendships is going to mean putting yourself out there, and that's hard, but if you do it, you will get some positive feedback and that will help your self esteem.   You may also feel the need to explain to your friend why you've been MIA. At first, I would say don't worry about it. Ask how she's been doing. How is school/work/her SO/her pet/her dad who lost his job last year. Show her you've been thinking of her and you want to catch up on her life.

FemmeThoughts,2l7x2s,hermithome,5,Tue Nov 4 01:59:38 2014 UTC,"I'm also a white (male) feminist and I feel a bit out of the loop. Someone tell me if I'm on the right track after reading these two articles.  I'm not a fan of Lena Dunham or her show and I don't know about her public persona or reception. It goes without saying that I haven't read her book. I think it's obvious that this is behavior (kissing against their will, checking out private parts) that parents should teach their children not to do, so that's probably(?) not the issue these articles claim is being contested by Dunham or her fans. The problem is that Lena Dunham's not fully owning the fact that it was wrong, right? Admitting it was like a sexual predator seems like a good first step to admitting wrongdoing. Are people also arguing that she shouldn't have written about it at all? I could get that, since her sister was the victim and it should be the sister's choice to admit it. But then again we might be angry at Lena if her sister spoke up at some point and Lena never did, as if Lena were trying to hide it. Regardless, the article says she was treating the abuse in a lighthearted fashion, which I didn't think was necessarily revealed in the quoted text I saw, but if that's truly the case then she should certainly be condemned for her tone. I saw mentions of the masturbation in bed at age 17, which is the weirdest part due to the age. (By then, you're not clueless about sexuality and privacy). I'm definitely treating the younger stuff with more leniency than the older stuff, not because I think it shouldn't be discouraged in children - it's still fucked up and terrible - , but just because children are so ignorant of morality in general in many circumstances.  So, have I found the problem yet? Someone give me a clear & concise summary of the problem (unlike my own messy & rambling attempt above!)."
FemmeThoughts,2l7x2s,MeAndLazarus,15,Tue Nov 4 11:28:29 2014 UTC,"To add onto the other comment  She sexually abused her younger sister and then wrote about in her memoir and doesn't consider either the abuse or the writing about it a problem. She knows it's predatory behaviour but it doesn't count when she does it apparently.  The reason writing about it is so problematic is that she wrote about it from her perspective. Sexually abusing her sister is simply a fun anecdote about how she was a weird kid. There are two sides to every story sure, but the victim's story takes precedence. Always. The sister gets to decide if to tell, who to tell, when to tell and how to tell. And she gets to tell her story. Dunham robbed her of that.   But then again we might be angry at Lena if her sister spoke up at some point and Lena never did, as if Lena were trying to hide it.    We'd be angry no matter how she found out because she sexually abused her sister and doesn't consider it to be a big deal or abuse. She robbed her sister of agency by publishing these stories. That's not okay. Whether she did it to make money, or because she considered it funny or because she was trying to protect her public image by speaking first....it's not okay."
FemmeThoughts,2l7x2s,diducrylol,10,Tue Nov 4 02:30:16 2014 UTC,"Someone give me a clear & concise summary of the problem   she sexually abused her younger sister and people are glossing over it as just 'weird kid stuff', including lena dunham herself. you can see the tweets from her about this in the article that is linked:   ""I told a story about being a weird 7 year old. I bet you have some too, old men, that I'd rather not hear. And yes, this is a rage spiral.""   she doesn't seem to even mention now how she carried on this sort of behaviour at 17 either.  it's not really that lena dunham 'isn't fully admitting wrongdoing', it's that she's seemingly not admitting wrongdoing at all. she likens her actions to those of a sexual predator in her book, but confusingly seems to brush off her actions as 'normal' despite this - as if being 'like a sexual predator' was simply a oh so weird quirk of hers - and is now upset that people are saying she sexually molested her younger sister.. which, you know, she did. that's what she did at age 7 and 17. there is truth to saying that at age 7 she needed her parents to teach her that her actions were wrong, but at age 17 with experience of the wider world she should have realised they were wrong even if her parents didn't give her specific guidance, and by age 30ish (which she is now) she certainly should have realised it was wrong.. but apparently, she thinks it's alllll finnneee and just her being 'weird'.  it wasn't just weird, it was sexual-abuse weird.  good blogpost about why all this is a problem, i've quoted but it's good to read the whole thing:  ""There’s one thing to remember childhood shenanigans but there’s another to speak about some of the weirdest things with no remorse and no regard to the impact they could have to the ones you inflicted possible harm on. And then to have no one close enough to you to check you on it. And then to stand wrong and strong in it. And to be 30 when all of this is happening and writing about it with such detachment is troubling. There’s overshare and there’s this.""  quoting you:   Are people also arguing that she shouldn't have written about it at all? I could get that, since her sister was the victim and it should be the sister's choice to admit it. But then again we might be angry at Lena if her sister spoke up at some point and Lena never did, as if Lena were trying to hide it   if she had wrote about it to admit to wrongdoing, admit to terrible actions or to say 'at 7, my parents really should have told me that doing this was pretty bad behaviour', then i don't think people would have had a problem with her writing it. it would be an admission, or a discussion about how her parents didn't guide her as they should have done at that age. it's because that her 'writing about it', in her eyes, is simply her writing about being a 'weird quirky kid' and NOT admitting to the severity of what she did, that there is the problem. she didn't write an admission, she wrote about it as if it were simply a 'quirky tale'."

That is until a very abusive relationship between a lead and her ""boyfriend"" went farther than I wished to see.   That was only a few episodes into the seasin.  I stopped watching.  The way it was written felt like the situation was being normalized, and while abuse is a common experience - it's not normal.   That's why I stopped watching and supporting.

FemmeThoughts,2l7x2s,see996able,6,Tue Nov 4 07:12:38 2014 UTC,"I have sort of a meta-discussion question. Some people are discussing the right and wrongness (or weirdness or typicalness) of Lena's actions, and to some extent whether she knew if they were right or wrong (either then or now).  I am curious about what people think about the more general issue of morality or moral judgement in regards to feminist theory. Would you say that morality is universal, or more culturally determined, or relative, or something else?  I ask this because I am wondering how compatible different moral systems are with feminist theory.  This is relevant because I think our moral perspectives shape how we think of Lena's and others' actions now as well as how we may judge those actions in different contexts (e.g future, past, or different culture)."

You have to find the right partner for YOU, and the ONLY way to do that is to be completely honest with yourself about what you want. NOT by putting on an act in order to garner male sexual validation.  The day I got married to my beloved husband, I was by no means in my prime, inasmuch as a porn consumer would consider a person. I was 40ish and slightly overweight. Sorry to have to tell mansplainers everywhere, my SO was the happiest I've ever seen him. I don't have to act like a porn star, I don't have to pretend I want to be spanked or rammed in the ass.  It really had nothing to do with him. I decided what I wanted and what I didn't want, and was more than prepared to be happy by myself if I couldn't find what I wanted.

Why are the men on reddit so insistent on anal sex but are almost never insistent on ways to give women orgasms using foreplay/gspot play/clitoral stimulation?  it just feels like so many men are sexist still, and  think that sex is all about men's pleasure.

A lot of women seem to have low self esteem these days due to the standards that are not only unattainable, but also not ideals we would naturally reach for if various inexorable media were not intentionally cultivating insecurity and objectification. If you feel like you're not pretty enough, it's probably not true, and perhaps a tad bit of low self esteem looking at you in the mirror.

Sex should be enjoyable for both partners, and if they're not attracted to me unless I bend over backwards for them in bed (literally and figuratively) they don't really want me- they want the porn parody. While there is a give and take with fulfilling kinks, because I do recognize that not everyone is into mine and there is some room for compromise, if someone just wants to use you to do whatever he wants and doesn't take your pleasure into account, he is bad at sex.

As for beauty - it is ephemeral and fades, and that is true for all women. Cultivate other aspects of your character that will always be with you - intelligence, humor, kindness, sympathy, affection, hell even talents - be a fucking rockin musician, or an artist, or even a damn good mother. Those things will never fade, those things will never be diminished by a man's gaze or lack thereof.  And as for finding a good partner - there are so many different kinds men in this world, just as there are so many different kinds of women, and there are the counterparts of every type of character. Cultivate your own character and personality, find pride in who you are and what you do, and you will find a man with similar values, ideals, and traits, and he will admire you and respect you for who you are as a person, not what you look like or how you are in bed.

I have a very narrow definition of what I think beautiful is for myself. I want to look a certain way, and I'm disappointed in myself when I don't. I want to be able to be a certain way in bed, and to appeal to a specific audience. I feel like, for myself, I do not live up to expectations, even though I have never once had a man tell me that.   I don't know if there are other women who feel the same way, or have the same perspective, but I just wanted to throw out my two cents."
FemmeThoughts,2l52xi,beckyemm,2,Mon Nov 3 19:12:51 2014 UTC,"I feel like this everyday. Even if I see plenty of wonderful women, especially my family members, that are older and overall great and loved. I don't know what it's like to be them, and what they're going through as they age. But I'm afraid that I could be as wonderful as they are (as if) and still face the problems you've described. It's really just going to get worse for me in the looks department as the years go on, and I'm even having trouble being okay with myself now. It's scary for me to think about myself in the future.   In the sex department, I feel the same way. I've only been in one relationship, but I did experience that. I don't want to say he was trying to use or objectify me, and I do think he loved me. But still, I feel like a complete letdown in bed because I wasn't doing some things that I either had a hard time with or just plain hurt. I did not feel like my pleasure was recognized too much, but I think he also felt that way because I wasn't deep throating him all the time, or doing X other thing. It makes me sad. Also, when it comes to porn, he'd ask me if I watched any, and I really don't. Once in a while I will seek some out, but I'm immediately reminded why I don't like watching it. I very very rarely find any that's appealing to me. I think he was joking, but he kinda seemed like he thought I was lying about not watching it. Then he'd say he doesn't watch much, but who knows. You're not alone. I come here to remind myself of that too. That I'm not crazy for feeling this way, and that there are people out there who will be kind and understanding."

I recommend that you expand your dating pool to men you might not otherwise consider.  Maybe guys who are shorter, in a different field from what you're used to, from a different area, a little older?  I'm dating a guy who is 4 inches shorter than I am, didn't go to college (I have a professional degree), and works in a trade.  I would never have considered dating this dude if I hadn't gotten to know him online (not a dating site, something unrelated).  He treats me with respect, is my best friend and adventure buddy, and is awesome in the bedroom.  He has a lot of qualities that I would never have found if I went with my instincts and limited myself to tall, professional types.  I am not saying you should lower your standards to include things that might be dealbreakers for you (like drug use, smokers, no job - whatever your particular limits are), but do think outside of the group that you've been hanging with, and you might find men who are respectful and can really please you."

Wanting to have the same name is not inherently sexist.  Sometimes it makes sense to take someone's last name, like if you want to have the same name and one partner already has a reputation in their field and another partner does not.

I was glad to not have to change my name again after divorce, but frankly I felt it was a PITA for my ex and myself to have different names while married. People had a hard time believing we were married. When he was sick in the hospital, I was required to bring our marriage certificate before we had Power of Attorney signed. Having separate names complicated things. Is that fair? No. Yes, we all have to make sacrifices like this in order to change things, but frankly I'd rather make a stand elsewhere at this point.  I'm happily remarried. I took his name. He could have taken mine or we could have joined names and hyphenated. I thought about what my name means to me. Honestly, it means I'm related to my dad. My mom is dead. I have nothing to do with my dad personally, and nothing to do with his family. They named me with his name when I was born, yes it was my name, but I didn't CHOOSE that name, it was given to me by a man.

My SO has his Mother's last name and they have a broken relationship. She is insane and narcissistic. I want absolutely to do with her name. He doesn't either. He's talked about changing his last name to his father's. His father died before we met, so I don't want that either.  What I do like is my SO's middle name, Xavier. That is the only thing I would change my name to. I'm hoping to be a professor someday so I would love to be ""Professor X, haha. The real reason is that I would  like us to have one common identity for us as a family.  He's uncertain what he wants to do. He doesn't want to take mine, but he likes the idea of the middle name.

Because entire societies' history of lineages are dominated by men, and women's role in historical lineages is literally erased upon marriage and never acknowledged upon birth of new generations. The tradition puts men above women, clearly, as their last names dominate society and women submit to the names of the men in their lives.   And modern men and women are not 100% free to truly make their own individual choices because none of us live in a vacuum and the views of society do affect our motivations and desires. 92% of married women took their husband's last names; the percent of men who take their wive's is essentially incalculably low. We can't honestly say that men are free to take their wive's names or women are free to not take their husbands' when living in a society with that dominating statistic."

I agree with you! And I agree that the way this system was established patriarchally says something about how women's importance was viewed, but I'm not sure that it's still problematic now. I think having a standard for the way our system of personal identifiers is assigned is just functional at this point, like everyone driving on the right vs left side of the road.

The article then goes into what some groups have tried to do to help alleviate the problem, but how those efforts are not great because they perpetuate rape culture and suggest that the main problem with rape is a ""data"" problem.  Crux of article's point:   Undercover Colors and Good2Go are technological tattletales. Both are designed to tell the truth about an encounter, with the objectivity and dispassion of a database or a chemical reaction. Tattletale solutions make sense only if we see rape, fundamentally, as a problem of bad data. But thinking about rape this way implies that what we’re most worried about is men being wrongly accused of sexual assault. That the reports women provide aren’t reliable, and should be replaced by something “objective.” These technologies prioritize the creation of that data over any attempt to empower women or to change the norms around sexual violence; they’re rape culture with a technological veneer."

The act of being interogated by an officer before going before a line-up where the perpetrator is present, can cause my accuracy in identifying the perpetrator to drop by ~20%.  Even worse, if I do pick the wrong person out, then that new person becomes a part of the memory I recreated. By the time I get to trial I am completely convinced that the person I picked was the one, because I ""remember it clearly"".  I don't think any scientist who studies memory could ever be brought to stand behind personal testimony or eye witness evidence. Having some kind of non-memory evidence is important (e.g. DNA). The fact is, reports that anyone provide can be unreliable regarding any experience.  Of course, the courts do not have to stand by the rigor many scientists would feel comfortable with. And in the end, someone has to make a decision about what the proper balance is between false positives and false negatives, because there will always be a trade-off. It just happens that our system of law is built upon the premise of letting a thousand guilty go before falsely accusing an innocent, a philosophy that hearkens back to the enlightment and is not specific to rape."
FemmeThoughts,2kw8gn,gottavent1,31,Fri Oct 31 16:08:01 2014 UTC,You're not overreacting. He was inappropriate and then tried to get upset with you about it. Good on you for standing your ground!  And it's okay to feel bad about it even though it's been awhile. I'm sorry this happened to you!
FemmeThoughts,2kw8gn,linguistrose,21,Fri Oct 31 16:15:37 2014 UTC,"Obviously you're not going to have him charged with anything four years later (as another commenter suggested), but that is nonetheless a perfect example of sexual assault (sorry).  You are totally justified in feeling creeped out/disgusted -- he acted creepy and disgusting. The shame/guilt you're feeling is also, sadly, totally normal to feel as part of a culture that thinks men can do no wrong unless they actually rape somebody. You might have more success if you took charge of your decision, ie. convinced yourself that you acted rightly (and you 100% did). He was completely in the wrong.  This guy sounds about as skeezy as it gets -- I'm embarrassed to share a species with creatures like him, but they unfortunately do exist. I really hope you don't have to ever come into contact with him again."
FemmeThoughts,2kw8gn,GoldieFox,18,Fri Oct 31 18:19:42 2014 UTC,"My only question I guess is, is it sexual assault or harassment or anything to try to forcibly grind on someone? I mean there was no consent, I was obviously not into it. I used to think it wasn't but now I'm not so sure cause he was literally dry humping me. But then he was mad at me. I feel like it's got to be something otherwise I don't know why I would feel so shitty about it. It'd be therapeutic to label it, I think. That way I can stop thinking about it. I feel really conflicted though because I mean, he's straight up raped people. At least in comparison what he did to me wasn't that bad. Is it a big deal? Am I overreacting?   It's an assault, and it's sexual. You probably couldn't get him convicted of anything, but if you want to call it sexual assault I'd think you're justified in that."

Like other people said below you probably can't bring charges, and if he stopped touching you when you said to, then you were at least lucky in that regard.  It sucks that he got mad at you, but he got mad because you called him out for being gross. He knew he was being inappropriate and a lot of people's self defense is to make the other person feel terrible. Don't feel terrible.  How weird that your mom talks about him so much. Next time she starts in, just tell her you don't like him and you don't want to talk about it. Then don't. I mean, if you think she'll be receptive to what you say you can try and tell her, but if not, walk away."
FemmeThoughts,2kw8gn,MarthaGail,7,Fri Oct 31 18:48:39 2014 UTC,"What he did to you was sexual assault. Straight up. No ifs, ands or buts. He sexually assaulted you. It really sucks that happened to you. The fact that he got mad at you is (unfortunately) typical of the kinds of guys who do this to girls. They feel like they're owed whatever they want to take from the girl, and when they get denied, they get angry at the girl, as if she should feel bad for not letting him sexually assault her. It's not your fault at all- any decent guy would ask before doing something as blatantly sexual as grinding, and would back off and apologize as soon as you expressed discomfort."
FemmeThoughts,2kw8gn,Quo_Usque,11,Fri Oct 31 23:46:59 2014 UTC,"is it sexual assault or harassment or anything to try to forcibly grind on someone?   Yup.   But then he was mad at me.   Because he views you as an object - how dare you object?   Is it a big deal? Am I overreacting?   Probably the fact that you had little-no support from your friends and the fact that he's constantly being deified by your own mother, and you just know that she wouldn't believe you if you told her the truth makes this a bigger deal than it could have been if you had support from your friends, knew your mother would trust and believe you, and so on. But it's a pretty big deal either way, especially because you know he's a rapist, and that, given different circumstances, it could have been much worse than it was.  Just because forcible grinding was all he thought he could have gotten away with at the time doesn't make it any less gross, is what I'm trying to say."

Black:  I didn't say anything about my attractiveness, I was joking about my awesomeness. There was a complaint that I shouldn't have this profile pic, I explained that it's something I had to do.

If they were only used for high fashion, that's one thing, but for everyday clothes for everyday people? I don't get it.  If I see an ad for lingerie or whatever that's basically, ""Look how good this woman with a similar body type as yours looks in our clothes,"" I'm totally going to buy it. If you show me an ad with a woman who I will never look like wearing lingerie and say her body is perfect, you're not telling me I can be as sexy as her by buying your product, you're making me feel bad about my body. You're making young girls grow up thinking being ashamed of their ""imperfect"" bodies is okay. The same thing goes for men and the super muscular, chiseled, male models.  Why can't they just keep high fashion and regular fashion separate? Let one be the snobby art and the other to help normal people figure out what clothes they should buy.

FemmeThoughts,2kpzcr,INTPLibrarian,8,Wed Oct 29 22:11:30 2014 UTC,"This seems like common sense to me. But then I read this paragraph:   Rosin describes a case in Pennsylvania where a local district attorney threatened to bring child-pornography charges against girls who showed up in widely pictures. In a similar incident last year, a girl at a private school in Alexandria, Virginia was expelled after she texted a topless photo to two boys whom she trusted and who then shared it widely. The boys were not censured.  Earlier in the year, the city of Cincinnati, dealing with widespread sexting among high school students, decided to punish the ten girls whole photographs were shared the most. In another case cited by Rosin, in which the more typical gender relation is reversed, two girls convinced a boy with autism to send them a picture of his penis. They shared it widely and the police chose to go after the boy.   and I'm just horrified. When does it ever make sense to punish the child in a child pornography distribution case? That's so upsetting that these kids, who have had their trust so violated, are only further punished. Why are the other kids who own the pictures let go? Possession of child pornography is suddenly okay for minors while production is not? How does any of this make sense??  And sadly, to be honest, I don't see this behavior ending with teens. You see revenge porn online and even referenced out in the real world (I'm thinking that stupid It's Always Sunny quote that gets screencapped and passed around every other month on reddit). Now I don't really think revenge porn and forwarding sexts have exactly the same motives; I think putting up porn after an ex jilts them is done out of spite while forwarding sexts to friends is done out of curiosity, excitement, sexual exploration, and peer/societal pressure. However, at their core both fundamentally ignore another person's consent and right to respect and privacy and I think that it's a trend in our society not limited to teens."

The problem is applying child pornography law to consensual sharing of images of oneself."
FemmeThoughts,2kpzcr,Pixelated_Penguin,3,Thu Oct 30 17:47:22 2014 UTC,"I listened to an interview of the author of the Atlantic article. I believe it was on Fresh Air. The author said the teen girls compared their pics to Pokemon cards. The boys weren't necessarily interested in using the photos as masturbatory material, but they wanted a pic nobody else had.   I was disappointed Teri didn't address the relative positions boys vs girls are in. Girls are vulnerable to being ""traded"" and boys have nothing to lose at all. I guess if people start getting prosecuted for sharing photos without permission, it might help."

I mean, perhaps in a generation from now when we've all grown up with this as a part of our culture from the start, will parents know how to tell their kids not to do this.  There doesn't seem to be any technical way to prevent the copying of photos, even if mobile phones automatically embedded DRM into each texted or emailed photo that prevented forwarding, there's always a way past DRM, and further, no one wants more DRM or justifications for its overuse.  The distressing part of the problem, to me, is that it's one that can only be fixed by changing cultural attitudes.  If teens, mostly girls, weren't so often socially ostracised and humiliated by the leaking of compromising photos, then it would be less of a problem, I suppose, but that would require a huge cultural shift that doesn't seem to be in the near future."

FemmeThoughts,2kox4u,Redkiteflying,7,Wed Oct 29 17:11:00 2014 UTC,"Great stuff. Does anyone know when exactly feminism gained it's current stigma? I feel like I missed the exact moment and cause. I turned around one moment, and all of a sudden, feminists are bad, man hating extremists. Was the 90's? The 2000's? I was pretty sheltered growing up, but it really surprised me to learn that people had that attitude about something that was such a positive force back in the day."
FemmeThoughts,2kox4u,rachawakka,16,Wed Oct 29 20:20:14 2014 UTC,"I think it's always been there. In the beginning, there were men who legitimately didn't think women deserved equal rights. They were likely traditionalists who didn't like change; probably they really believed women benefitted from staying home and raising children while the men did all the hard work like voting. As societies changed and women were more accepted in the workforce, men who believed equality had already been achieved resisted anything further as tipping the scale in the other direction. Finally, many men today simply see any hint of discrimination as a personal attack on them for being men. They don't like the uncomfortable reminder that they are men and don't have the same social problems as women. They may feel guilty, deep down, and because they feel like they can't do anything about it, it seems unfair to point it out to them. They get defensive when they should realize that it is possible to be male AND to admit that women sometimes get the short end of the stick, and the blame doesn't have to fall squarely on them (unless they see the problem and refuse to say or do anything about it)."
FemmeThoughts,2kox4u,turris_eburnea,5,Wed Oct 29 20:35:19 2014 UTC,"I do think that some of the added backlash comes from men and women coming closer to equality nowadays, not that we're there yet obviously.  I see something similar with racism.  The younger generations especially think it's over because we think of racism as being enslaved and segregated.  The more subtle stuff is hard to notice and if you hang out with good people it's easy to think racism is dead.  So I think something similar has happened with feminism too.  Women are working and can vote now, aren't they equal?  Personally I blame history classes.  We all got taught that you have to treat everyone equally now, but at the same time we were taught about slavery and sexism as this long distant thing that we have come close to defeating.  Then there'd be some lip-service saying that this stuff is still happening but never explaining exactly how.  It's easier to sweep aside that notion when sexism is more nuanced now.  Saying ""I think women are inferior"" is usually going to catch flak but saying ""women are naturally more emotional than men, it's just science!"" won't."
FemmeThoughts,2kox4u,meldolphin,2,Wed Oct 29 21:15:40 2014 UTC,There's an awesome book called Female Chauvinist Pigs that looks at how we went from women burning bras to 18 year olds posing for girls gone wild.

FemmeThoughts,2kl9v3,coffeejeong,43,Tue Oct 28 18:04:50 2014 UTC,"I'm a champion of free speech myself, and I understand on the one hand Reddit's stance of not censoring content.  However, the real issue IS one of free speech, in that by not stopping the hate, or even looking for solutions to it, the opinions of those who disagree are silenced.  It's a chilling effect.  I've left subreddits because of hateful attacks and I'm a white man.  It leaves people unwilling to say anything, creating a system where speech is 'free' but only for those willing to bully and intimidate dissenters.  That's the problem.  Free speech needs to be fostered, but it also can't be absolutely free.  There need to be rules.  There are dozens and dozens (i'm loathe to say hundreds) of subreddits that are some variation on the n-word or various epithets and slurs, and that's just hate against black people.  There's a similar set of subs about misogyny, violence against children, disabled people, and the list goes on.  Further, when these subs get banned (eventually) there's nothing in place to stop them from putting a goddamned '2' after the original sub's name and start right over.  So I fully agree that reddit is drowning in hate speech.  It doesn't always hit the front page, but intimidation of feminists or minorities is not hard to find in comments sections or in smaller subreddits.  However, one way for activists on reddit to tackle this problem is to send messages to the advertisers.  That's how facebook started to listen to complaints about misogynist pages, by showing the advertisers how their ads were showing up in pages depicting and glorifying violence against women.  I believe Nissan actually pulled all Facebook advertising over it.  If reddit is trying to start making a profit, and they'll be stepping up with their advertising, then that's where to focus efforts.  Show the ad for male-targetted products on a sub devoted to beating women to the company that paid money for that ad.  Proctor & Gamble probably wouldn't be impressed if their aftershave/razor/etc were right next to a list of photos of bruised faces or hateful words.  Maybe Universal Pictures wouldn't be happy that their targeted ads on theredpill for the latest action film geared towards young men were being treated like it was part of the content on that sub.    Get the money to dry up, at a time when reddit is being pressured to turn a profit, and their 'hands off' owners might start throwing their weight around.  Who knows."

I tell everyone I know, especially women, who starts redditing to make an account and to use that to unsubscribe from certain subreddits that they might not want to be bombarded by.  I try to encourage people to use reddit in a way that will keep them here, because I do really love reddit.    These discussions wouldn't be happening if women and minorities and anyone else maligned by the hive mind didn't love reddit, because it'd be easy to just walk away from it and find something else.

FemmeThoughts,2kl9v3,MommaDerp,2,Wed Oct 29 00:15:14 2014 UTC,"I help moderate a few smaller subreddits, and while I haven't personally seen any racist comments, I do sometimes see sexist comments, hate speech, and general trolling. Luckily we generally keep on top of things, but it is almost a full time job at times. To me, I think the people who troll or go around saying such hateful things think that since it is the internet and ""no one knows who you are"" they can just be awful people and get away with it. Sadly, besides banning them from the sub there isn't much we can do as mods. We did have one user who was VERY hateful, and even started spamming all the mod's inboxes with very rude and hateful comments, just because he was banned from the sub. (one of our faves was he called us all ""whale thunder c*nts"". Seriously) We contacted the reddit moderators, telling them about this person, and their solution was to ignore the PMs by blocking the user, and to report and ban them if you see them on the sub again. Did that keep him from creating a new account and doing it again? Nope. We just had to keep blocking and ignoring him, until finally he gave up.  I just wish there was a way to ban their IP address, or somehow give the user some damn accountability. You wouldn't say these things in person, why the hell can you get away with it on the internet?"
FemmeThoughts,2kl9v3,hermithome,2,Wed Oct 29 01:28:44 2014 UTC,"Yup, thats how we are in the subs I mod too! Just sometimes we get the crazies who will send PMs to the mods/people that disagree with them, and it can get hairy. And yeah, the troll every once in awhile is annoying, but no biggie. Just sometimes we have to mod more than often, especially when people are on holidays.  True about the IP- if a troll is smart enough they can get around it. But at least from what I've seen in our subs, most of the trolls seem like they probably are younger kids, just looking to be ""funny""."
FemmeThoughts,2kl9v3,see996able,2,Tue Oct 28 23:22:14 2014 UTC,"Reddit is indeed a disgusting cesspool of racist hate-speech.

FemmeThoughts,2kl9v3,so_srs,1 point,Wed Oct 29 04:47:18 2014 UTC,Unfortunately this is not as hard as it once used to be. There are new e-phone number services available that allow you to use a disposable number linked to your email account.
FemmeThoughts,2kl9v3,nightride,1 point,Wed Oct 29 05:04:34 2014 UTC,"No. I'm against every service that demands a verified phone number. Most e-mail companies do and that's appalling. This is a class issue, and an important one. G-mail only stopped requiring a phone number to create an account after they were criticised by librarians associations for months. (Librarians often work to help homeless people sign up for e-mail and other internet accounts). Yahoo still does it.  And e-phone services are generally blocked. That is, you can now create a google account without a phone and get a free phone number from google voice, but you still can't sign up for Yahoo, because that google voice number won't work.  Reddit could easily make a huge difference though. They could ban hate subreddits and they could make hate speech against site rules. They could ban people for sending creepy PMs and other forms of harassment.   They could also implement filters, so that creepy PMs were caught before the user received them. They could do a lot, and they choose not too.  They could also do what /r/blackladies and so many other communities have asked for: they could give the moderators more power and control over their sub."
FemmeThoughts,2klbag,tandem7,11,Tue Oct 28 18:16:06 2014 UTC,"Well, the word construction of rapism seems a bit peculiar, since the intended meaning is not analogous to what the ____ism construction usually denotes in the given context. Racism - discrimination/prejudice  on basis of race, sexism - discrimination/prejudice on basis of sex, ableism etc, you see where I'm going with this. Admittedly there are exceptions, like ""feminism"", but since your friend made it a point to compare rape culture to racism, it does ring a strange association in the brain so it's probably not the most fortunate choice of word.  I actually like the phrase ""rape culture"", if we disregard the fact it  seems to be used more satirically than seriously in the mainstream Internet conversation for example. I like it because it automatically implies the problem is global and systemic (ingrained in our culture), as opposed to it being incidental and something we can just attribute to the villains whose existence is a necessary evil.   This is, interestingly enough, probably the reason some people (read mainstream Reddit, I don't really have experience or data for much else) don't like the term, because most people react to word ""rape"" by drawing associations to violent assault by a stranger, and completely ignore all those situations that ""pass"" as consensual, like for example:   R1: She/he said yes, what she/he meant or actually wanted isn't my concern.    R2: You're not wrong R1, round of applause for this person."
FemmeThoughts,2klbag,AAL314,6,Tue Oct 28 19:04:15 2014 UTC,"The -ism is definitely part of my reaction; it bothers the word-nerd in my soul :P It suggests that what is being discussed is the theory or state of rape, and while it seems similar, that's not exactly what is being discussed when rape culture is brought up in conversation (in my opinion).    I like it because it automatically implies the problem is global and systematic (ingrained in our culture), as opposed to it being incidental and something we can just attribute to the villains whose existence is a necessary evil.   I like this as well - I feel that the inclusion of ""culture"" makes it obvious that we're discussing an attitude that is so pervasive that we all are exposed to it, and that we are all agents who may propagate it, unknowingly or otherwise.  I also think that the addition of -ism makes it easier to brush off as intrinsically motivated (i.e., oh, that person is just a jerk!), rather than acknowledging that there are harmful, societal beliefs and attitudes at work. Like, racism is easier to paint as an individual thing than as a cultural or society-wide issue - and there it is, you have just helped me sort out what I think bothers me the most about re-branding."

Basically, it's a weird return to biological essentialism where a person is wholly defined by what's between their legs. They often aren't nice people; they've been known to harass trans people online (there's at least one lesbian TERF that I know of who finds trans lesbians on dating websites and reports their profiles to the dating website for violating site rules, based on her belief that a trans woman is a man who is trying to rape lesbians), and most feminists reject their doctrine because the idea that our sex is determined by our genitals is old-fashioned and patriarchal."

FemmeThoughts,2kbe42,linguistrose,15,Sat Oct 25 21:20:11 2014 UTC,"My 5 second explanation is ""feminism is the belief that one's choices should not be limited by one's gender."" They should be limited by your abilities, which sometimes have to do with one's sex (eg ability to become pregnant), but are almost never solely due to gender."
FemmeThoughts,2kbe42,confusedinsomniac,9,Sun Oct 26 01:37:33 2014 UTC,"This is awesome, but I would add a small caveat.  It is sometimes easy to assume that because one person in a relationship has more ability in an area, like moving couches or cooking food, or even somewhat enjoys the activity more, that it is therefore automatically their default job.  This came up for me many years ago in a relationship.    My significant other wanted the house clean and automatically cleaned whenever necessary.  I had a much lower standard of what qualified as ""clean"", so rarely did much of the work, because the house never got that dirty.  IMHO the optimal outcome in such a situation is not to have the first person doing all the cleaning all the time, unless they actually get a peculiar joy from drudge work.  Rather, it seems to me that the optimal outcome is to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps with the former person lowering their standards a bit and the latter increasing their own.  I feel that it is a feminist impulse that the necessary but undesirable tasks in life should be shared, even if everything doesn't end up with a clean dividing line straight down the middle."

For survivors of violence who turn to feminist activism as a result, the point is to prevent more violence against themselves and others, not to somehow “wallow” in their “victimhood” to gain some imagined social benefits.  In fact, society is usually not very kind to those who speak out about their experiences with violence—blaming them for what happened, accusing them of “ruining” their abusers’ lives, telling them to shut up and deal with it."

FemmeThoughts,2kaswg,see996able,8,Sat Oct 25 17:26:06 2014 UTC,It is important to remember. Gamergaters would never consider themselves sexist. Just like the KKK don't consider themselves racist.
FemmeThoughts,2kaswg,Jello_Raptor,1 point,Sat Oct 25 17:39:44 2014 UTC,"Just being a pedant, but lots of KKK members were unashamedly racist. Initially because society didn't talk bout racism as a bad thing, and later as a way to harden their sense of identity in the face of societal backlash.  Mind, lots of KKK members didn't call themselves racist too.   What neither GamerGate or the KKK do is consider themselves bad people. Gamergate doesn't think they're sexist because of the social connotations of the term, and the lack of it being grandfathered in as part of their identity, unlike the KKK and racism.   (Note: I'm not a historian or a social scientist, most of this is based off of stuff I recall but can't cite. It turns out that googling for ""KKK self admitted racist"" gets you a bunch of stuff about reformed KKK members, but nothing analyzing their internal use of language.)"

FemmeThoughts,2kaswg,so_srs,-4,Sat Oct 25 18:30:53 2014 UTC,"The author is correct, and this is something that I have explained to others before, but this is simply about the encroachment of women (although other encroaching/controlling forces have been demonized/attacked in the past) into gaming.    But the author (and the media in general) doesn't clearly explain why these ""young men"" (boys more likely) care that women are encroaching into gaming.  First, much of gaming culture has accepted threats of violence as a means of showing displeasure.  If you mess up in an online game, expect threats and other verbal abuse.  I receive death threats/ threats against my mother on a regular basis.  I am not mentioning that to suggest that the women who received death threats/threats of physical violence should just suck it up.  Instead I bring that up because I want to emphasize how normal it has become for gamers to use threats of violence.  In conjunction with leaked personal information it becomes a truly scary tactic, and it needs to be stopped.    Second,  we are talking about a group of ""young men"" who don't feel that they are in control of much.  They go to school, they live at home (not by choice), and they likely listen to their parents for the most part.  Now a group of people are coming in and trying to change something that they love and feel in charge of(or at a minimum are criticizing it), and they are scared and are attacking those who they feel want to change what they love.  These people have their identities described as ""gamer,"" for better or for worse by society. I was labeled as a nerd and as gamer growing up.  When you critique gaming, you critique part of my identity.  Young men often do not have the maturity to accept this critique, and instead see it as an attack and they then feel the need to fight back.  Personal attacks are some of the easiest ways to fight back, and within a community where threats are already commonplace and pretty accepted, it is obvious what their response will be.   Third,  I am upset with the way in which gamergate is being reported about because it often (not always) makes it seem like some big surprise that these women are being treated in this manner.  Even within the gaming community there is large acknowledgment of it's own toxic nature.  Insults/threats based upon race, ethnicity and gender are common place within gaming.  This has been a problem for many years, and the fact that the media is only now responding seems outrageous to me.  Edit - Hopefully that makes it more clear.  When you write a first draft, rarely do you get clarity, or at least that's how it works for my writing.  Me stating ""ples no pitcforks"" and ""not to blame the victim"" were really just due to poor structure.  Mentioning something that without further explanation could be interpreted as such, but that with more explanation is clearly not the case.  Now that it's restructured they shouldn't be required."
FemmeThoughts,2kaswg,DOTAVICE,15,Sat Oct 25 19:01:58 2014 UTC,"Before the pitchforks come out  Now this is not to be a victim blamer   When you find yourself writing shit like that, best hit ""cancel"" instead of ""save""."
FemmeThoughts,2kaswg,so_srs,-6,Sat Oct 25 19:42:38 2014 UTC,"Well do you honestly find fault in what I said?    Lets take the pitchfork portion.  I brought that up because if I were to compare my experience of harassment with that of those who were targeted by gamergaters, it would be rightfully deserved.  As I clearly stated, there was little legitimacy behind the threats I received, in direct contrast to those received by the women, who had much of their personal information stolen/leaked.  Again, as I clearly stated, my intent was not to compare the results, but instead what was done to spark those reactions.  All I did was perform poorly, and I got an over the top and undeserved response.  Sarkeesian (as i pointed out earlier) rightfully called out the gaming industry.  That will receive (and did receive) a massive backlash.  Now to the second point of victim blaming.  Merely pointing out that this was to be expected isn't in my mind victim blaming.  For me the fact that it is to be expected calls for a massive change withing the gaming world.  Its why I talked about needing to remove the hornets nest.  This shouldn't be the default result of critisizing the gaming community/industry, but it is.  Time and time again people have their personal information leaked/hacked because according to gamers they did something wrong.  That needs to change.  Acknowledging that this is common place is not victim blaming.  I said I applauded what she did, I believe she did the right thing.  The fucked up response from gamers is what is to be blamed, and what I clearly said needed to be changed.  Let me use an example to explain why I don't feel that I blamed the victim in this case.  When a woman wears a short skirt and gets catcalled the immediate response of a victim blamer is to suggest that the woman wear something else.  This is an unacceptable solution to the problem, because it places the blame on the victim.  In my senario, I acknowledged that women who wear short skirts get cat called, but called out the cat caller as the problem. Women should be able to wear what they want without getting cat called.  The solution lies with fixing the catcaller, not the person who was cat called.  Just like with Sarkeesian, the response that she received is common place and expected.  The solution in my mind is not for her to shut up.  Its for everyone to vocally support her, and show that this kind of over reaction to mere critiquing is unacceptable.  If you still feel that that pitchforks are deserved, or that I am blaming the victim, please let me know.  But I am honestly very much against anything Gamergate related, and I don't think anything I've said or described in either post qualifies."
FemmeThoughts,2kaswg,DOTAVICE,11,Sat Oct 25 19:54:49 2014 UTC,"You're not writing effectively. I can't discern a point to either post.  If you're writing ""before the pitchforks come out"", it's pretty much guaranteed that the pitchforks should come out. If you ever find yourself writing those words, you're doing something horribly wrong."
FemmeThoughts,2kaswg,lockedge,-2,Sat Oct 25 20:02:09 2014 UTC,"Well if my points weren't clear then I must have messed up somewhere, as you said, ineffective writing.    I'll try to restructure to see if I can make it more clear.  Fundamentally, while the article in question addresses the manner in which the Gamergate movement isn't about journalistic integrity, it fails to outline what the gamers are really upset about, or address an over arching culture within the gaming community that accepts threats and general violent behavior.  I bring this up because many articles that I see posted talk about what gamergate is doing, but fail to try and explain why they are doing what they are doing.  My first point is that Gamergate is using threats and leaking personal information because that is a general tactic of gamers in general.  As I explained with my example of my own time within Dota 2, gamers result to threats of violence over very minor infractions.  It stands to reason that if this is an excepted way to respond to minor infractions, then it will be expanded upon in response to what gamers interpret as major infractions against them.    My second point addressed why they feel that someone like Sarkeesian, who is just making a simple critique, has committed some major crime in their mind.  These gamers have in many cases little control over their own lives.  In their mind, games are their space, their world.  When someone else tries to come in and say that its bad, or that it should change, they respond in this way.    Then I said that this is all bad.  That we need to change it. I'm not sure the best way to change it besides everyone just saying its wrong, but I worry about how effective that will be."
FemmeThoughts,2kaswg,DOTAVICE,8,Sat Oct 25 20:19:22 2014 UTC,"I agree that a lot of writers haven't really touched on the major issues of 'gamer culture', which are so often made quite visible when controversy happens, especially when it challenges the culture or the current understanding of gamer identity.  I can't count the amount of times I've seen normally calm, collected gamers with scientific mindsets throw that all away when faced with discussions of sexism in gaming. Often, the same people pushing for 'objectivity' in game coverage and reviews are the same ones attacking media attempts at being objective in the cultural issues inside of gaming.   And I think that has a lot to do with some other identities these people carry (such as being atheists, for instance), which cause parts of their identities to butt heads, causing confusion and a need to find someone to blame for causing the discomfort/cognitive dissonance.   I'm not sure what solution there is to any of the massive cultural issues that make gaming a hostile territory rife with sexism and other nasty traits, but it's pertinent that the blame not be cast on a vague, villainous ""gaming culture"" or ""gamers"" or ""gamergaters"", but instead the aspects of these cultures and individuals that make it abhorrent. And that's why I feel Anita Sarkeesian gets as much hate as she does, because she's pointing out and naming some of these issues (most of which I agree with her about, even if she tends to choose her examples poorly). The more people out there pointing at things that specifically make the culture bad, the better we'll eventually be off, I figure, so long as it can be framed as not being inherent in the culture, but something infecting the culture. Frame it less as something inherent in gamers, and it can be seen as something outside of their identity."
FemmeThoughts,2kaswg,Stone_Conqueror,0,Sat Oct 25 21:01:26 2014 UTC,"You are right, I should avoid framing it as something inherent within gaming culture, and instead as something that is/has infected it.

FemmeThoughts,2kaswg,DOTAVICE,4,Sat Oct 25 21:06:40 2014 UTC,"one of the main reasons Anita Sarkeesian gets so much hate is that she is seen as someone who is critiquing gaming culture from outside of gaming culture.   That doesn't explain why Felicia Day, a gaming culture icon, did get harassed after coming out against GG, or why Chris Kluwe (who is definitely not within gaming culture) got absolutely no backlash from GG after writing an article openly dedicating to insulting them.   This is about misogyny, plain and simple (""how dare teh wimmin intrude on our games!!!11!""). Anyone who thinks this is about ""ethics"" is deluding themselves.

And it is a positive message, right? So why is it so bad?  Hell, even if they don't care about the message they're sending, they're still trying to send it, which means they're still spreading a more positive message than 99% of other clothing companies.  Even if they weren't donating part of their proceeds to charity, what is so bad about trying to sell t-shirts with a positive message on them? I mean I think it's obvious, and entirely justified, that a lot of people here would be outraged by yet another company flogging shit like this, and it bugs me to no end to see the shitty, sexist differences between clothes for little boys and little girls, so why is the opposite not also true? Why can't we be happy when people try to sell nice things? A business is a business, but that doesn't mean those which try to earn their money in socially aware and positive ways are bad, does it?  I guess I just don't understand that argument at all.  And as for the exploitation issue:  Firstly, and this may not actually be the case, but I noticed that the way they shuffled the script between the girls meant no single one said anything about the entire rape statistics thing, for example. Some of them used the word rape, but generally without much context iirc, and it's not like they don't know that word... I slightly suspect this isn't a coincidence and that they didn't actually show the girls the full script to hide them a little from the meaning of what they're saying... But even if that isn't true I don't think it's terribly important.  You see kids in major films - which are also for profit - all the time in traumatic situations. And maybe people do complain about that, maybe it's an issue I should be more aware of, but it's not something I've ever seen people get particularly angry about. I don't see that an advert should be any different.  Kids that age aren't stupid, they understand a lot of this stuff. Or at least they do if they have parents who have educated them about sex and consent, which I very much think they should have. So I really don't see how this is any different from hiring kids to perform in any advert on TV.  The article uses a lot of emotive language about some important principles which are apparently being violated by Big Bad Capitalism, but for the most part I didn't really get a sense of what the author actually believes those principles to be.  Edit: a spell or two."
FemmeThoughts,2k5caz,eliasv,6,Fri Oct 24 08:47:07 2014 UTC,"Did you see that terrible video FCKH8 made trying to capitalize on Ferguson? This is what they do. I don't think they care about what they claim to, and I think the messages they send are twisted because of that.  https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSBusiness/comments/2k5921/fckh8_exploits_little_girls_in_order_to_sell/cli72lj   Ayup, as I've said before, fckh8 started off as a viral company, stealing content from reddit and facebook, reposting it to reddit and facebook. /u/jess_than_three, another user, and I researched them like ~3 years ago. Was at the time run by a couple white (I believe gay) dudes. They conveniently presented themselves as something that could easily be mistaken for a non-profit, but was just a t-shirt selling venture, that at the time didn't even pretend to give money to charities.  The got bought out a couple years ago by a viral marketing company and now they have a bigger budget. They also did a video campaign about Ferguson, capitalizing on that in order to sell t-shirts. Color Lines talked about it some roughly 3 months ago."
FemmeThoughts,2k5caz,eliasv,8,Fri Oct 24 13:19:02 2014 UTC,"Like I said, even if they don't care, I don't see what's so terrible about that. And I find it very unlikely that none of the people involved with making that video care at all, they are real human people with real human opinions who make these adverts. If it were me with the job of selling t-shirts I would be incredibly grateful for the opportunity to actually create something socially aware for once rather than the same old 'sexy models in sexy poses'.  And again, 'the messages they send are twisted' feels like an appeal to some completely vague 'important principle', without any attempt to explain and define what you think the actual issue is. Twisted how? Because you disagree with it in some slight way? Which way? I have no ulterior motives and it seems like the sort of message I'd be happy to send.  'Not really caring and just trying to make money' wouldn't be an excuse for the people selling the openly misogynistic clothes I mentioned, so why does it have to invalidate what would otherwise be a positive message in this case?  Making money through the reinforcement of positive values is better than making money without attempting to reinforce positive values. I just can't fathom why anyone would think that isn't true. It's not like the products aren't even related to the advert, the things they are selling are literally designed to spread this positive message. How is that bad?  People moan so much about how Big Mean Corporations don't care about us and do all sorts of faintly racist and misogynistic shit in their advertising and products all the time, but as soon as they do anything different somehow that's even fucking worse. I just don't get it. It's nuts to me."

So why are we MORE upset when a company does the same thing, but to sell a social justice message we agree with, and donates 20% to charity?

This being my first comment ever on GG despite following it closely against my own better judgement, mirrors Felicia's sentiment on being silent on the issue.  One of my life long dreams has been to someday be a game developer, I love games, I love software development, I learned to code when I was in 4th grade and if I allow myself to stop being modest for a bit I'm going to admit that I was three times a competitor in the International Olympiads in Informatics (IOI), the first game I created when I was 11 was a digital recreation of a ""15 slider puzzle in Turbo Pascal, which my father promised me to buy me another game if I could code it under a week, he never delivered his promise but I kept getting better at coding.  This is not humblebrag, I'm bragging, I admit it, and own it.  This day, I might be closer to this dream than ever, having learned LUA and OpenGL and making (incomplete, to be honest) digital adaptations of ""Settlers of Catan"" and ""Arkham Horror"" which I cannot distribute because of copyright, but can act as more impressive resume or business card. I don't know if I should continue. My current work at banking software development is breaking my love for programming and the current climate under the hashtag of gamergame it's close to breaking my passion for games. Is the game I been tinkering for years going to be attacked because of my gender? if the game, or any other I code in the future, is successful, am I going to receive backlash because something I wrote about feminism? am I going to be doxxed? or am I just going to fail? I don't know which is worse.   Am I going to receive treats because of this comment?   I don't think I'm fearful at this moment, I'm sad, sad to see a dream come close to crumble.

Suggesting that they should be charging for it is really just an insidious form of slut-shaming; what the author is actually saying is, ""if you're going to act like a whore, you should be charging for it, not giving it away for free"" - that's a horrible, messed-up sentiment."

I really, really hate this ""sexual economics"" bullshit too - especially when it is framed as some kind of biological truth. More so, because research has shown that females of various species can be surprisingly promiscuous (even if assumed monogamous) - the idea from Darwin (all respect to him) that females are ""coy"" and avoid reproduction is... just not true if you look at the data.   Despite which, considering how causal sex or sex outside of wedlock has impacted the lives of women in history (and still do in many countries) - is it any wonder we've come up with a culture that is much less permissive of female sexuality?

I have a massive beef with sexual economics theory precisely because of the way it models women as the suppliers and men as the demand in a sexual marketplace; this completely ignores the fact that women also want sex. Suggesting that women should only share nude photos with strangers if they are getting paid for it denies female sexual agency, and ignores the fact that if these women are consensually sharing their pictures, presumably they are getting something out of it for themselves (e.g. sexual gratification)."

And since she fired it intentionally wild while there was a child there, she did actually endanger her child. So it seems to me that yes, a guilty verdict in that scenario is reasonable.  In fact, firing your gun intentionally wild is really bad in any circumstance - you don't know where that bullet's going to go, how it's going to ricochet, and who it's going to hurt or kill.  The 20 year sentence is beyond the fucking pale though. However it is my understanding that it's the mandatory minimum for crimes involving guns in that state, or something stupid like that. In a legal system that makes sense, a judge would be able to take all the other factors into account - she was battered, she was probably not in her right mind when she fired the gun - and give her a suspended sentence or use any of the other tools that judges had before the legislature decided to dip its fat administrative fingers into the judicial branch.

We don't believe in anything you believe in, and we don't want you as our fan anymore.""   Or maybe that HAS happened, but it's been drowned out.  And the gaming community wonders why it has such a terrible reputation. It's going to continue to have a terrible reputation for as long as jerks like this are the loudest voices. I realize media has a part to play in this too, and controversy sells stories, but it would be awfully nice if the controversy was instead ""EB Games releases statement that this kind of behaviour is not tolerated among its employees or customers - 'Gamergaters are dead to us,' says president"""

These companies are the ones with the worst problems with sexism, homophobia, racism and so on. They treat their employees terribly and are abusive businesses. And they actually have serious ethics problems.   They don't really have any incentive to speak out. And they're not stupid enough to piss off the GGers.

They treat their employees terribly and are abusive businesses. And they actually have serious ethics problems.   Do you actually know much about the two companies that were listed as examples in the post you replied to? (Valve and Blizzard.)  Valve is one of the most intersting corporations that I can think of, and certainly treats employees better than 99 percent of other corporations.  There are no official titles or hierarchy(although the founder certainly holds more sway than most within the company), people are free to work on whatever project they please(all the desks, computers, and chairs are on wheels so they can be moved from place to place), and there is an awesome snack room!  They have produced some of the least sexist and most empowering games for women, first and foremost Portal/Portal 2 which features a non sexualized female as the lead portagonist, and robot (with a woman's voice) as the hyper smart AI enemy (Glados).  In addition, Dota 2 (a game that they didn't have full artistic control over) features a vast number of playable female characters, many of which are the strongest carries in the game (Luna, Mirana, Spectre, Phantom Assassin to name a few).  They are often scantily clad, but boy are they powerful as hell, and like I said, Valve didn't have full artistic control because many of the character's original models were taken from WC3, a Blizzard title.  Valve doesn't even have a PR department, so that might be a reason they haven't said anything.  Which brings me to the next company, Blizzard.  Blizzard has actually apologized in the past about sexism in games, and the shortcomings of the titles that they have produced in terms of representing women in a positive light.  You can read the President of Blizzard's apology right here.  http://arcadesushi.com/blizzard-president-and-co-founder-apologizes-for-games-lack-of-diversity/  Frankly, like most mediums where men produce the content and market it to young men, women are portrayed in a less than positive light in most catagories.  But the two companies listed as examples, two companies that you proceeded to crucify, are actually arguably the two best in the business in terms of recognizing the problem, and providing content that doesn't degrade women.  In fact I would say that Valve is a role model for how companies should treat their employees.  Rather than condemn the whole industry as you did, especially when responding to the example given by the post you replied to, why don't we try to look at it on a more case by case basis?"
FemmeThoughts,2jv9yc,DOTAVICE,2,Tue Oct 21 12:10:20 2014 UTC,"Because no one else is around at the moment, and it's a relatively minor infraction:  <mod hat on>  You're free to disagree, but you're not free to engage in personal attacks.  Consider this a warning.   <mod hat off>     In response to your comment, yes I do know a fair bit about these companies. First, I should point out that I was commenting on the large companies in general, and not any specific companies. I didn't crucify any specific company. I didn't even mention Valve or Blizzard or EB (a company you didn't ever notice was one of the names OC gave), I spoke about the larger gaming companies in general.  But even still, I don't consider Valve and Blizzard to be the shining beacons that you do. Sure, comparing them to the rest of the field, they aren't that bad. But I don't think that means as much as you do. Sure, Blizzard responded well to a PR crisis and didn't double down. That doesn't mean a whole tonne though. Companies make apologies for this shit all the time without actually changing their behavior. They get rid of a problem person, or hire a diversity consultant and everyone oohs and ahhs and jack shit actually changes except for their image.  And yeah, there's a reason that the larger gaming companies mostly haven't spoken out and the few that have were incredibly late to the party.  Also, on a side note, I find it hilarious how you defended Valve by blaming Blizzard and then turned around and instantly defended Blizzard because they apologised, so it's all totes okay. And when you're defending massive companies with bajillions of titles by pointing out less than a handful of strong female characters, you're kinda missing the point."
FemmeThoughts,2jv9yc,DOTAVICE,3,Tue Oct 21 22:55:09 2014 UTC,"And when you're defending massive companies with bajillions of titles by pointing out less than a handful of strong female characters, you're kinda missing the point.   I'm not defending massive companies, I don't like to generalize. I think that Valve has a progressive company model, and treats it's employees exceedingly well.  I've seen plenty to support that, and nothing to contradict that. Blizzard on the other hand, I don't know much about.  I know that in the past they have been criticized and have apologized, and that they refuse to release games that they don't think are up to a certain standard, but beyond that I'm not sure what its like to work there.  Its why all I said abut Blizzard was that they did admit they were wrong.  Neither blizzard nor Valve have large quantities of titles.  Valve pretty much only has 3 more titles, Half life and the mods it spawned, Left for dead (which has more female characters that I didn't mention, who are strong and not sexualized) and Dota, which their redone version of a Blizzard mod.  Blizzard has WoW, Starcraft, Diablo, WC3, and a new game based upon that universe that is similar to Dota.  Hardly a swath of titles.   I'm not here claiming that the gaming industry is open minded or a positive place for women to work.  I'm not claiming that most companies within the industry have a good track record.  I don't know anything about EB, so I won't say anything about them.  What I can say is that the one of the two other companies provided in the example actually has a great track record, and the other has at least apologized in the past.  That is all that I said, and all that I will continue to say."
FemmeThoughts,2jv9yc,Pixelated_Penguin,3,Tue Oct 21 23:18:05 2014 UTC,"And its a bit insulting to describe someone else's argument as ""hilarious"" when it actually makes sense.  Blizzard is largely responsible for the art direction within Dota.  Icefrog and Valve wanted to maintain as much parity as possible with dota allstars(so much so that they have actualy gone back and patched the old game to keep it current with the new one, for the people who for whatever reason still play the old version, the new one is a free to play game), which was a WC3 mod (blizzard).  Valve could have changed the models more, but they didn't.  If you believe any sexualization of women characters is bad, then they should have changed it.  I personally don't see it as a problem in Dota, mostly because the characters themselves have depth, aren't there simply as eye candy, and are some of the most powerful characters in the game.    But the original art design is Blizzard's for the most part.  My mentioning that they apologized does not absolve them of their sins, but it does show a recognition of the problem."

No matter HOW you eat, someone, somewhere, thinks you're doing it wrong.  The guilt and stress over it is crippling--I have been there, and am slowly recovering. Food feels like it has all these moral implications...but it doesn't. It really, really, doesn't. You may not be able to hear that and believe it yet, but seriously, the best thing you can do for yourself is abstain from all the dumbass media and articles about food. Tune out the assholes who think they know better than you (they don't) and eat the way you want. The only people you need to listen to are your doctors (and even they can be wrong sometimes, but better to trust them than any asshole off the street).  Humans have survived for thousands and thousands of years on some pretty strange diets. BUTTER used to be its own food group back in the 40s. We are still alive.  The media has made eating seem more complicated than it really is. The only rules are: eat when you're hungry, eat what you want, and get checked regularly by your doctor to make sure your health is still in the balance. If it's not, take YOUR DOCTOR'S suggestions on how to fix it, and then repeat from the beginning.  I would highly highly suggest therapy to work out some of your issues (if you aren't already). Exposure therapy helped me a lot to get over my guilt/fear of food. And now, I made myself a pizza bagel for lunch and it was glorious.  *Edited for typos"

Anonymity can bring out the worst in some people, but I think the biggest cause of these kinds of hateful websites is our own culture (if we're talking about the US). People believe this stuff because the people in power let it slide. Young people who believe these things probably take heart from the encouragement of their fathers and the tacit approval of some of the authority figures in their life.  This is all to say, if we want to stop these hateful websites, we have to try to change the culture, instead of trying to shut down the sites. The websites and their bitter members are a symptom of an old set of beliefs that won't let go. This could simply happen over time as more progressive generations take power and older generations die out or if a large number of people in power publicly come out in support of feminism and equal rights. A reasonable, organized movement could also be a big help in spreading awareness and shaming the people who spend their time spouting hateful, ignorant bullshit.  I honestly think that an organized movement of normal people (women and men, excluding those who want to turn it into a gender war) would be the most effective. The problem would be keeping it focused towards a single, tangible goal, and making sure that no one tries to decentralize the movement and create a bunch of splinter groups. Most importantly, we should remind people that though we have made some great progress, the battle is not won. Sexism is not beaten and likely will never fully be beaten, in much the same way that racism isn't over despite everything that happened in the 60's.  And there would certainly be people who would have a strong interest in destabilizing such a movement. Human pieces of shit are worried that Anita Sarkeesian (dunno if that's spelled right) might become a feminism martyr if she were murdered, though they would really like to murder her...for pointing out sexism in video games. All of this is hypothetical though. I'm not sure that even creating such an organization would be possible right now, and there are already plenty of feminism groups in existence trying to change things already, though none of them seem to have any prominence.  I really hope that one day I can live in a world where the majority of people can look on women as equals and take them seriously, even when doing a job that a man usually does. Or when a man is talking to a manager that happens to be a woman, he doesn't automatically assume she is the secretary. But I think there is some work to be done before we reach that point."

FemmeThoughts,2ji2kq,Pixelated_Penguin,5,Fri Oct 17 22:00:39 2014 UTC,"I think I can provide some insight into why sites like this and their ideologies are able to garner such a following, and maybe I can help answer the question about how we should weigh hate speech against free speech.  To give this some context, I'm a straight male 3rd-wave feminist with a particular interest in transgender experience and identity, straight male experience and identity, and how the two are able to inform each other.  I think the red pill, RoK, and brands of conservative Christianity that fixate on preaching and defending 1950's gender roles are fucking deplorable, however, I used to buy into some of that crap way back in high-school, so I understand what its like to be in that mindset and how you get there.  For men who are involved in these ways of thinking, its not the hate that's compelling. They don't see themselves as part of hate groups. What they find, or are trying to find is security in and understanding of their gender identity as straight men. Many straight men are trying to figure out what it means to be a straight man, and how that shapes their identity, yet the only groups who are really invested and vocal in trying to answer that question are the red pill, manhood academy, Rok, conservative Christianity, etc. It is easy when we dismiss these groups and their message to end up illegitimating the question that they are trying to answer.   The question isn't often directly asked in terms of masculine gender identity but in terms of masculine gender performance- these groups often use lines like ""you can become the kind of man you were always meant to be"" that suggest that meaning in one's gender identity can only be found in increasing one's conformity to a masculine norm. To feminists, this does not look like an answer to a question of gender identity (because it's not), but that does not simply make it a desire to reclaim the trappings of old gender scripts and social privilege for those who are the most masculine. At the heart of these movements are men who want to feel secure in their identities, but tragically the brand of masculinity they subscribe to preys on insecurity as a means of enforcing conformity, and feminists and the LGBTQ community are constantly telling them that the masculine norm they identify with is shit (which they are mostly correct about).  Before feminism hit the scene, gender was understood in a binary and complimentary way: femininity was understood as that which was not masculine, and masculinity was that which was not feminine. Perhaps  the greatest achievement of feminism was to shift social understanding of the feminine to become increasingly defined by the voices and experiences of actual women. This has resulted in the female identity becoming increasingly expansive, but masculinity, by and large, still defines itself as that which isn't feminine, causing it to become increasingly narrow. Today a woman isn't stripped of her femininity in the board room the way a man's masculinity is seen as diminished as a stay at home dad. This isn't a reverse sexism, as it is something that is primarily perpetrated by men against men.  IMO, the best thing that feminists can do to combat this kind of thing is to recognize that these aren't simply a bunch of shit-bag misogynist men, but that there is a legitimate question regarding straight male identity that our culture is not answering satisfactorily.   Personally, I had a hell of a time making sense of myself- I faced the third wave feminist dilemma, but as a man: I held a progressive view of what gender equality looked like and that we didn't need to conform to the established masculine script, but at the same time, I identified personally with so much of it. I look masculine, and I like looking masculine. I like fixing my car and chopping wood. I fucking love beer and scotch. But traditionally masculine things aren't always easy to separate from systems of patriarchal power: I love suits and the way I look and feel in them, but I also feel that they communicate an image of masculinity that is tied to financial success- something I am staunchly against. I don't want to impose a gender script on my son, but at the same time I want to share with him all the things I enjoy, which more often than not fall into the realm of the traditionally masculine. This is the kind of stuff I deal with today, but for a long time ago, back at the beginning of this process, being a man who took seriously feminist criticisms and tried to figure out what they meant for my own understanding of my identity just sucked. It was a lonely and guilt ridden process, and I was in my early twenties and full of angst about it. I tried sharing with feminist friends that feminist critiques were really making me go through some serious deconstruction of my identity, that I was having a hard time embracing my masculinity as something that could be good, but they didn't have any answers and seemed concerned that I was twisting feminism to put masculinity back at the center of the conversation- which is admittedly a legitimate concern, but not what I was trying to do at all. I just wanted to be understood, because I was having an impossible time of understanding myself. I have a feeling that most of the men who are attracted to places like ""the red pill"" are ultimately looking for a strong sense of masculine identity and a community that recognizes and understands them in that.   Feminism has a vested interest in helping men feel empowered and understood in egalitarian and creative expressions of masculinity, but has traditionally been far more interested in the deconstruction of masculinity as an oppressive social reality than rehabilitating masculinity into something that is non-domineering yet still empowering, similarly to how femininity has been transformed.  As for the free speech vs hate speech thing- censorship just isn't effective. The most subversive thing you can do is to not give into the us vs them mentality and engage them with the kind of civility that you stand for. Its not about shutting them up, but making sure that we are using our free speech to get our message across in a manner that is more compelling and appealing to young men than it presently is. One particularly effective avenue is to focus our efforts on showing how things like RoK aren't just bad for women and non-cis men, but bad for cis men.  And you're not alone in this stuff making you angry- I work so hard to keep a stoic attitude about it, but that just makes it all the worse when it still gets under my skin.  TL,DR: The reasons why these ideologies are gaining momentum are more complex than they appear- we see it simply as hate speech, but it attracts men because it appears to offer a stronger sense of identity and belonging than feminism does. The solution is not silencing them, but using our own free speech to offer a more compelling vision of masculine identity and feminism's acceptance and concern for men."

As to the other part...saying hurtful things about a group of people in no way abuses them of their right to be themselves.  When someone criticizes RPers, would that be abusing their right to be themselves?  But most importantly, any mechanism put in place to police speech you don't agree with can be turned against speech you DO agree with.  For example; some politician could argue pro-choice arguments are ""hate speech"" against the unborn.

I actually had a ""friend"" on Facebook post how all transgendered people were either faking it (MTF) or betraying women (FTM).  Just some history (HERstory), because my feminism looks like your feminism.  Edited based on /u/legbeard4lyfe comments!"

FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,imogenbeeton,8,Fri Oct 17 17:32:00 2014 UTC,I believe it started with rad fems reacting to the second-wave feminist distinction between sex and gender. TERFs believe only sex exists (and somehow also believe it ISN'T a social construct).
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,Fairleee,2,Fri Oct 17 13:42:55 2014 UTC,"They exist. Germaine Greer, Janice Raymond and Sheila Jeffreys are well known and have all published material within feminist circles that is extremely transphobic. The biggest feminist music festival in the world, the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, explicitly rejects trans women from attending citing a ""womyn born womyn"" policy.  Oh and I was not saying all rad fems are TERF's - rather, TERF's tend to self-identify as rad fems."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,autowikibot,5,Fri Oct 17 03:20:23 2014 UTC,"If you would like more information about what TERF's believe, there's a nice blog post which uses Daria to explain their viewpoint in a fairly straightforward way.   If you would like a more detailed deconstruction of TERF ideology I would highly recommend Julia Serano's book, ""Whipping Girl"", specifically Chapter 12: ""Traditional sexism and trans-women exclusion policies""."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,thesilvertongue,2,Fri Oct 17 13:34:51 2014 UTC,"I saw that, it's a massive shame as all the ""womyn born womyn"" policy promotes is the reductionist fallacy that women are defined by what's between their legs. But there was some great news earlier this year - the annual Dyke March London announced a trans woman as their keynote speaker, and basically she, the organisers, and many of the attendees told the TERFs who protested to STFU. There's a great article about it here."

FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,anthrogeek,1 point,Fri Oct 17 02:00:13 2014 UTC,what's so bad about the writing?
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,ponyproblematic,25,Thu Oct 16 19:01:01 2014 UTC,"If you can't see it, I'm not sure I can describe it. It's like a six year old playing a villain - ""I'm Mr Bad Bad Guy, and I'm very bad, and I say bad things, rah"".  Someone just reminded me of the phrase ""on the nose"" and that's exactly it. It's hopelessly clumsy overexplicit cringiness.  If you want to show that someone's bad, you don't stand them there for five panels shoving what you think about them as words in their mouths. Mallard Fillmore has more subtlety."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,anthrogeek,13,Thu Oct 16 19:03:10 2014 UTC,"I agree.  Not that it's amazing, but this comic makes a similar point with signifcantly snappier writing.  It's two people having a conversation with each other, with a twist at the end that is intended to make the reader think.  Contrast to the original comic, which is basically two people engaging in a very staged dialogue for the benefit of the reader.  If you could rearrange or delete a panel at will without significantly changing the impact or message of your work, you probably could benefit from some editing."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,lisa-lionheart,1 point,Thu Oct 16 22:05:57 2014 UTC,"So she repeats words too much? I don't get what you're saying. I'm reading her other comics and she might not be the best writer but it's not ""cringe-worthy"" or anything."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,so_srs,15,Thu Oct 16 20:02:16 2014 UTC,"It may as well be a text post entitled ""TERFs are bad"". There's no dialog. It's just a bunch of random sentences shoved in text bubbles."

FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,Shaysdays,9,Fri Oct 17 06:26:47 2014 UTC,"The best way I can describe it is to look at the phrases in the third panel. Specifically: 'We have gotten stuff done too.' and 'The blood washes right clean'.   Say them aloud, they feel awkward. People just don't talk like that. Even minor diction changes would make a huge improvement. 'We've gotten stuff done too' or 'The blood washes right off'."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,so_srs,6,Thu Oct 16 20:13:58 2014 UTC,"""The blood washes right clean"" might be a regional thing- where I'm from, that wouldn't be unusual at all, except for the blood stuff."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,lisa-lionheart,1 point,Thu Oct 16 20:19:33 2014 UTC,"That's entirely possible, that's why I choose another example too. Ultimately, I think the goal if you're publishing globally should be to refrain from as many regional ticks as possible. But thats more technical writing concerns. I just wanted to show an example where small diction changes would have the biggest impact."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,so_srs,0,Thu Oct 16 20:25:17 2014 UTC,That's barely a difference. This is just coming off as you folks giving her a hard time for pretty much no reason.

FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,HappyHarpy,9,Thu Oct 16 21:11:54 2014 UTC,"I agree. The diction is so jarring that it obscures her message, that is very unfortunate."

That way the message fits the medium and is better suited for our instant gratification. ;)  I don't know that I cringed, but when I read it I got a little of that ""beating a dead horse"" feeling."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,ElitistHatPropaganda,19,Thu Oct 16 20:39:00 2014 UTC,"What is the point of things like this? I mean this seriously. It's not going to persuade anyone, so it isn't that. From what I can tell, its point is ""look at how awful these people who disagree with us are!"" Which is different from supporting Transpeople.  I guess I scratch my head at encouraging shallow echo chambers based on self-righteousness. I would get ""your views are wrong/bad and here's why"" or ""I want to write something to support transpeople who were hurt"". But writing things that are basically ""I'm awesome because I'M not like THEM haha they suck"" doesn't seem emotionally healthy? Is there a point to this besides group membership affirmation?"
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,ElitistHatPropaganda,26,Thu Oct 16 20:47:28 2014 UTC,"There are times when works of art are about convincing others.  There are times when it's just about venting to people who already get it.  There are times when they're pages of our diaries.  This comic doesn't have to be about convincing. It can be about frustration. It can be a rant. It can be any of the above and either succeed or fail to accomplish its goal.  Also, I'm pretty sure the author is trans herself, so she really may not be trying to persuade. Maybe she just wanted it off her chest. Maybe she was thinking of the primary audience for this piece to also be trans.  Whether or not the comic succeeded in doing whatever, there are still plenty of reasons for things to be made."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,allthecats,0,Thu Oct 16 20:55:43 2014 UTC,"I agree venting is important, but... I don't know. This is a problem I've seen with intersectional discourse in general: there's a lot of venting and affirming 'yes, we are the good group' and not much else. In some ways understandable since marginalized populations are less likely to be able to access emotional support outside of these spaces, but there's still a lot of focus on a dynamic of venting that isn't healthy 24/7.  It also stifles discussion in feminist spaces. By which I don't mean 'I am here to defend TERFs', I mean literally any kind of discussion. There is only one appropriate response to this post, which is a shallow 'right on, girl!' Anything else says 'you are not in the good group; you are either a bigot or a woman who isn't putting supporting others first'. This post ALONE isn't a problem; it's the frequency of things in this vein from a lot of sources.  And posting it here makes it more of that. (Unless the submitter is the author of the comic). Vents are just that: vents. Outside of emotional support for the author, they don't have purpose. If the submitter of this post is a transwomen who wanted to vent about TERFs, then she should have said so. But just posting someone ELSE'S vent with no further commentary? Again, one appropriate response."

I think it's more about affirming that [x group] isn't the bad group which societal standards often portray them as. And yeah, venting 24/7 isn't healthy but I don't think most trans, or black, or gay, or whatever folks spend all their time doing it. If they do, it's more likely they're whiny people as a personality trait and / or youth, and not so much due to their marginalized status."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,allthecats,-1,Thu Oct 16 20:35:12 2014 UTC,"Oh, I completely agree that it's not because of their marginalized status. It's just something I think we should watch out for because it can eventually stop being productive and actually prevent healthy living and action as marginalized people. And again, it's a problem with the discourse and culture, not the groups themselves. I've noticed it in the gay community as well as feminist ones.  Also agree some of it is due to youth. Part of where I'm coming from is having gotten to the point of 'holy crap being that angry all the time and talking about it so much, even when it's justified, is really, really not good for me!' The validation can be addictive, especially for people who are marginalized because they are more likely to have been denied validation.  I also approach social issues from the background of a group that doesn't do this very much, so it's a different way of dealing with oppression, culturally speaking."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,ElitistHatPropaganda,3,Thu Oct 16 22:39:37 2014 UTC,"Part of where I'm coming from is having gotten to the point of 'holy crap being that angry all the time and talking about it so much, even when it's justified, is really, really not good for me!'   I'm glad you were able to realize that and move away from it. I've had similar issues in the past so I do understand what you mean.  The thing is, though, you've reached that level and while that's fine for you, there are people who are still in need of the whole venting / validation stuff, you know? And if this discussion is upsetting to you, you're not obligated to participate. One other thing is that trans people are still highly marginalized and at risk in a way that is still less understood and less visible, and therefore less recognized, even within feminist communities (obviously, otherwise we wouldn't have TERFs running around being assholes). I think it's important to give trans people and their venting / frustration / anger a little more space than we'd maybe be inclined to give to other marginalized groups simply because, while we have a looooong way to go in those areas, we are even farther behind when it comes to trans issues. Holy run-on-sentence! but I hope that made some kind of sense.  That said, your comments have widened the discussion here and that's valuable, even though I disagree with your overall point about this comic."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,ElitistHatPropaganda,12,Fri Oct 17 03:44:15 2014 UTC,"Sometimes it's socially necessary, valid, and important for one person to say ""that person is an asshole,"" so that everyone can nod in agreement.  Just because everyone's thinking it doesn't mean it doesn't need to be said; it's valuable to articulate it clearly so that everyone can be aware that we're all thinking the same thing.  You call it an echo chamber, but to a trans gal like me (and the comic's author) that echo functions like sonar; it's a tentative ping to test the social landscape.  Maybe it seems like a foregone conclusion to you that of course TER""F""s are assholes, but that hasn't always been true of mainstream feminist discourse and it still isn't true today in some spaces which call themselves feminist.  I get how hearing ""Those transphobes are assholes!"" answered with an echoing chorus of agreement can be gratingly obvious and meaningless to some, but it's of a significant value to some trans* folk to hear that reply instead of a deafeningly apathetic silence or, worse, a communal roar of hatred."

It says it's a comic about TERFs. Nothing about what it might be, or its purpose. So I might click to look, see it's an emotional support post, and then feel like crap I don't have the emotional spoons for it, because I was taught to ALWAYS have them or I am a horrible person (which is where the mental illness comes in).   I'm not a giant fan of TwoX, but one thing I do like is that they have the support tag. It's easy to scroll past.  Also, you say people want to have this discussion, and... I don't see a discussion? Genuine confusion here.  Discussions involve multiple exchanges, not just affirmations without further conversation.   Lastly, telling people with mental illnesses to just suck it up is kind of antithical to this place being inclusive.  I don't think the sub should 'censor' itself, but doesn't that mean people in other groups can discuss what the discourse in the subs means for them? Or does it only pertain to certain issues? Genuinely confused here, not being a smart ass."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,Flower_Fairy,3,Fri Oct 17 21:17:45 2014 UTC,"We do have a support tag actually, though it wasn't used for this post.  And yes, discussions do involve exchanges, but your comment crossed the line. Yes, you can discuss what the discourse in the sub means for you, but in this context you were derailing.   We're not telling people with mental illnesses to ""just suck it up"" but we are saying that your mental health cannot come at the expense of other people talking about topics important to them or their identity. You for example specifically mentioned users searching the archive for threads regarding this topic. That puts your mental health above their ability to have the conversation. They weren't around for that conversation, and they want to have a discussion that's been had before. That's okay. We're a discussion group, and the same topics absolutely get brought up more than once. Your mental health needs are important, but they cannot freeze the group or conversation.   There are other issues to get into here, but this thread is not the appropriate place. I'm going to bring your comment to the attention of the other moderators, and you should get a PM from us in the next day or two regarding some of the issues you've raised."
FemmeThoughts,2jftyt,_throwawayagain_,5,Fri Oct 17 21:31:02 2014 UTC,"Also, your understanding of how mainstream TERFs are is more than a bit mistaken. See this comment, for example.  Yes, they may be mocked on many forums, even non-feminist ones, but several very prominent feminists are TERFs, and they get a lot of airtime.  There's a real disconnect between the mainstream feminist movement (which tends to be cis, white and middle-upper class) and the very intersectional feminist movement that sprawls and brawls on the internet."

A reaction to a work that isn't 'it is amazing' does not equal 'it should not be allowed'. Furthermore, the use of 'allowed' and putting that word in my mouth also implicitly imbues my stance with gatekeeping/oppressive authority which I do not presume to have. I have no power or desire to allow or disallow her to do anything. I see your use of language to frame me as approaching this discussion in a way I am not, and I reject that. I am a person with questions and opinions about something. That's it.  I disagree that marginalized people can't be self-righteous. As for 'chastising' her, yes, I do question the healthiness of this expression as part of a general trend. Just because someone is expressing their experience doesn't mean EVERY expression is equal.  It also doesn't mean she can't do it."

Honestly, she's just a feminist who made a series of well-received, mildly popular videos about feminism and pop culture - I'd never heard of her before the whole Gamergate nonsense and I don't think I'm that unusual in that. Now she's getting psychos making death threats against her, and more psychos saying not to kill her because they don't want her turned into a martyr for feminism (yes, that's the real reason why we shouldn't murder someone, not because it's an abhorrent thing to do, but because we mustn't give feminism a martyr!).   Ugh. Angry whiny brogressive man-children are just awful."
FemmeThoughts,2jdlgv,Fairleee,27,Thu Oct 16 07:26:34 2014 UTC,The points she made weren't all that groundbreaking or radical either.

The things she points out seem subtle, but reflect a whole series of endemic issues in the culture and media. And while she doesn't talk about it, those endemic issues lead to things like under-representation of females in the production of said media, and starts reinforcing this horrible self perpetuating cycle.   The points she make seem tiny, but have large consequences she doesn't really look into, for what I figure are screen time reasons."

FemmeThoughts,2jdlgv,mittromneysass,20,Thu Oct 16 08:38:51 2014 UTC,"GamerGate started when an ex boyfriend of Zoe Quinn (a game dev who created the free game Depression Quest) posted a list of people who she had supposedly slept with. Someone on the list was a game journalist, and a bunch of angry misogynists assumed that she was sleeping with him for good reviews, even though nobody on that list ever reviewed any of her games. They started GamerGate to combat 'corruption in journalism', but really they just spend most of their time harassing women and anyone who points out how shitty they are, trying to boycott any gaming websites that have ever acknowledged misogyny in games, and getting companies to pull ads from those sites.  Regarding Anita Sarkeesian, she used artwork that she thought was promotional material for a game (I think because she found it on IGN or something) but was actually someone's fan art. When she found out she apologized and they worked it out."

It does suggest that perhaps she should rethink monogamy, but that's not a massive scandal, that's just a bad breakup. However, online misogynists (initially at the prompting of her angry ex-boyfriend) have engaged in a massive campaign of harassment of Quinn and other women in gaming, claiming they're activists for journalistic ethics in the gaming press."

FemmeThoughts,2jdlgv,MommaDerp,21,Thu Oct 16 19:40:35 2014 UTC,Right? It's not like guys don't take advantage of all the social structures and conventions we can to buddy our way to the top. Except when guys do it it's just called networking. The only reason women are usually the only ones with the option to fuck their way up is that men have 'old boys clubbed' their way into most established positions of influence in the first place.

FemmeThoughts,2jdlgv,MommaDerp,2,Thu Oct 16 07:41:16 2014 UTC,"I'm kind of conflicted with that.  It seems unfair to get a promotion or something based on sleeping with your boss instead of being smart and hard working, regardless of your gender.   I happen to be 'attractive' enough to sleep my way to the top if I wanted.  I've had a few bosses come onto me.  IT made me feel unsafe at work because if I gave him a blow job to get a promotion he would have leverage and power over me after that.  It made me feel objectified, like my sex appeal is worth more than my education, smarts, who I am as a person, and hard work.  And it reminded me that one day i will be old and ugly and not worth anything to anyone because women are still primarily valued for their appearance, wheras older men are seen as powerfull and experienced instead of just 'used up'.  I have also been passed up for a promotion because another woman slept with the supervisor."

WTF??? Fuck that sub too. I wandered right back out in a hurry, though not before leaving something for the OP who sounds like she's going through hell.   I love your list of good subs and all the work you and other mods do to create and defend safe and supportive places online. This has helped me  so much."

The sub was fairly inactive too until recently.   I'll message the mods and give them a heads up.  And I encourage you to report things you see that break the rules, and if you don't see a change, message the mods. It's the best way to find out what the issue is. Are the mods inactive? Do they not enforce certain things? It's important to know.  And thanks so much, it's nice to hear."
FemmeThoughts,2j7tkq,hermithome,6,Wed Oct 15 02:12:50 2014 UTC,"I'm one of the mods there. Our sub is certainly somewhat active, but much like this subreddit we sometimes goes several days between posts. I would say in most cases offensive comments get deleted within a day, depending on how often each mod is on reddit, but in reality we only have to moderate a handful of comments each month.  In regards to the post mentioned above, it was at a -17 score, with several comments refuting what he was saying before we deleted it, but your PM to the mods was the first report we got about it. We're happy to remove posts that violate our rules, but our sub does a pretty good job of downvoting absurd comments into oblivion."

Usually people who are more vanilla have to preface all their posts with disclaimers or hopes to not just be downvoted. If they have to do that, it's not really sex positive. Oh, and fuck you very much if you're not a vocal advocate for all porn! That said, it's not always awful. A lot of good articles get linked in there."

FemmeThoughts,2j7tkq,RampagingKittens,2,Wed Oct 15 03:09:25 2014 UTC,"Depends on the subreddit rules really. Each subreddit makes its own rules and enforces them the way they want. You post anything in /r/CatsStandingUp that isn't ""Cat."" and it gets removed and you get banned.  Some subs do absolutely remove comments that are judgemental, especially if it's regarding something like rape or sex.  Besides moderators won't remove everything, but it gives them a good idea of what comments and commenters they need to keep an eye on."

People in there are so judgmental of anyone who even dares suggest that someone isn't ready for sex, or feels uncomfortable with certain sexual acts. I consider myself pretty open-minded and non-judgmental, but apparently it's not ok for that openness to include people who decide to put off sex for any number of personal reasons (emotional, spiritual, religious, etc.). Just because you know it's not ok to slut-shame anyone, that doesn't make it ok to prude-shame anyone into having sex in spite of their personal misgivings.  People DO have past bad experiences that affect their current sex lives, and their potential partners SHOULD be accepting of that rather than just leaving right away. But I've noticed that particular trend (a seeming spillover from r/deadbedrooms) more than a specifically sexist trend in r/sex. Not that I don't believe you, because I've definitely seen some red pillers over there, but I think there is still enough sense in enough of the people there not to let sexism and rape myths take over. I, at least, report any comments I see that are blatantly offensive in that way. I (possibly naively) still think there's hope for keeping those comments out."

On /r/sex it's absurdly common for people to say ""my SO was a bit freaked out about my kink/fetish,"" and again, everyone responds that their SO doesn't care about their needs and they should dump 'em and run. It's just so black and white."
FemmeThoughts,2j7tkq,bluntbangs,15,Tue Oct 14 17:06:47 2014 UTC,"I hate how they all believe you should ignore all the stuff you have in common and how much you enjoy each other outside of sex because two people who don't have the same sex needs are completely incompatible, and it's a doomed relationship. That may be the case for some relationships, but some people may be able to compromise on sex frequency. I'm 21. I NEED sex once every other week. My bf is 25. He would have sex every day if I wanted, but he only NEEDS sex two or three times a week. So we compromised and now we have scheduled sex 3 times a week. I define sex as any part of me touching his penis. So even if I don't want penis in vagina sex I'll give him a blow job or a hand job. We're really happy with this. BUT if I had asked /r/sex they would have told me to drop it like a hot potato despite my feelings for him. Idiots! If I, a 21 year old woman, can have a conversation with my 25 year old boy friend about compromising on sex frequency than surely all the other engaged and married people on /r/sex can."

Her personal views aside, she was good as a mod in that respect.  Of course, that impact waned toward the end.

They were still shoehorned into traditional feminine roles, wanting commitment and such, while the men who were supposed to be objectified were actually humanized as they talked about them as more than just a body to fuck. Kind of still put the women in a bad light in a weird way."
FemmeThoughts,2j2zqt,onlykindagreen,7,Mon Oct 13 17:42:57 2014 UTC,"Same sort of thing here. As well, the apparent message of the video was a bit too close to the ""why are you complaining about catcalling? people wanting to date you isn't a bad thing!"" rhetoric for me to really get behind it.  I'd say the closest to the mark besides Bulge Lady was the one who said ""I bet your job has health insurance!"" She quite clearly didn't care about who he was as a person or how he felt, but instead was focusing on taking advantage of something he had for her own benefit."
FemmeThoughts,2j2zqt,ponyproblematic,6,Mon Oct 13 17:59:00 2014 UTC,"These kinds of videos almost always fail to truly ""switch the genders"" in a meaningful way. They can be funny and clever, but never a true reversal that would change anyone's mind on the topic. So light-hearted videos like this actually make more sense to me than ones that sincerely try to reverse the genders.   The main reason is that men simply are not threatened by women aggressively coming on to them. When you have videos of women aggressively, rudely, and even violently coming onto men on the street, the comments show how much of a joke most men still think it is. They joke about how they'd love to get that kind of attention because they don't understand how constant objectification hurts, or they say how the man could just hit the woman and get away. And if it's done graphically enough (like that frankly upsetting french video) to make you actually think about how serious a problem it is, the comments instead turn into ""ok, this is bad, but it's obviously exaggeration. Women don't deal with that crap either."""

When I show videos like this (including that one really popular one where the chicks were jogging topless) my male friends just don't get it. Instead, they make comments like ""Yes, I would want that girl to cat-call me or notice me"" or ""I don't mind seeing women running around topless.""  Typically, when I see ""role reversal"" types of videos, I put it in the perspective of a gay man who is doing the cat calling to them. I hate that I have to use that example but it gets the point across for many of my straight male friends."

On the other hand, the amplification of these ideas over social media networks is validating and spreading pathology.   This is something I often wonder and fear, every time I see a misogynist, racist, transphobic or homophobic (just to name the ones that may affect me directly) comment, heavily upvoted, gilded and praised, I wonder if it's really from a fridge minority or is it that the majority of people actually think that way, that's what they actually believe. At best it show a great deal of apathy from the people disagreeing (because, being really honest, the upvote/downvote buttons are treated as a agree/disagree) and at worst it comes to show that indeed the majority of people are bigots, that most of the people I encounter everyday do hold a view against me just for existing."

I wonder if people with ideas that aren't accepted by society as much are amplified when they're concentrated.    When I speak with the friends around me, we have a broad set of topics we discuss.  When I go to my forums and chatrooms online, it is a very narrow discussions, that are spoken about ad nauseum.  I also wonder about the age of people.  Are these young people who say ridiculous things? Maybe they will grow up when they actually have to deal with the variety of people the world has to offer.

Unfortunately reddit is not standard affair compared to average life in a first world country.  I have been on reddit for over 6 years now and it was never this bad, not even close.  I am convinced it some how has concentrated the idiots.  One of the confirmation bias to how ""bad"" things are on reddit is the fact that either you're in a subreddit full of idiots, or you're in a subreddit like this one talking about how the idiots are idiots.  It's not fun.  As a trans woman I have migrated from male dominated places to female dominated places.  Honestly most male dominated places say awful things but their focus is just talking about the subject at hand.  Ever female dominated place has a constant thread of the negatives society gives women, etc.  I am not entirely sure what that says, but my guess is male dominated areas contain just as many females but they don't state their gender.  Male is too often associated as the default gender when it comes to anonymity.  Neutral things often become male things.  It's like Legos, they are gender neutral, but people still shove them into the male category.  Female things are clearly female, because anyone male would not want to be that.  It's part of the trend in society that feminine = weak/frilly, masculine = strong/structured.  Neither are true, but it even the best people unconsciously think such things.  Those who try hard to break that programming become a niche group and are ostracized for acting too differently.    One of my favorite The Onion articles was, http://www.theonion.com/articles/woman-takes-short-halfhour-break-from-being-femini,35026/  It really puts things into perspective."

I don't think I could be attracted to someone who wasn't a feminist in principle, if not by name. My current boyfriend didn't call himself a feminist when we first met, but he made his views on gender equality and social justice pretty plain so it didn't bother me. Through exposure to academic feminism through the act of getting to know me, I think he became more self-aware that his views aligned with the status of a feminist and never really had an issue calling himself one once he started to really think about it.  In the end, you can open people's eyes to things that they hadn't considered before and that is a worthwhile pursuit. But I personally wouldn't waste my time and energy trying to ""convert"" a guy with problematic views on women if it's clear to me that he isn't interested or willing. Guys who have those kind of views are already unattractive to me by virtue of not respecting me and other women as equals. They may be harder to find, but I don't think they're as rare as your friends seem to think. Most of the guys in my social circle I would consider feminists or feminist-leaning and I'd consider them the kind of guy you're describing."

We dated for a while, and he turned out to have a wonderful progressive attitude about consent, but we never talked about the label.  I moved, we broke it off for a while, and when I moved back he was running a sex-positivity club, organizing training sessions for helping people help sexual assault survivors, and generally doing more for feminist causes than I've ever done. I was impressed as hell, we got back together (this wasn't why we did, but it was certainly a plus), and he's been active and awesome ever since. He encourages me in activism and I wouldn't have it any other way.   I don't think I could go back to dating people who don't care as deeply about issues of consent. For someone I'm going to have sex with, we need to be on completely the same page. And aside from that, I'm a woman in STEM. I have no interest in arguing gender representation and how it makes me feel at home--that shit is tiring.

Really, how many men do you need?  Even if a feminist man is 'rare,' and your list of what you want is even more restrictive, you really only need one guy to meet that set.  Or a few.  But all that matters is who you're with, a deeper bench isn't really helpful unless you want a harem or something.  And maybe I've spent too much time in the Ivory Tower, but that kind of guy is kind of dime a dozen at a major university.  Also there's nothing wrong with online dating.  The other part is that it kind of depends on what you mean by a man ""being feminist.""  I don't think it's hard to find a man who supports the feminist movement and feminist ideals - but if you require a commitment of action, that changes things, and is probably something you should bring up with anybody you're interested in.  Third, you shouldn't feel the need to convert people you date.  It's exhausting and tedious, and frankly there's no reason to believe it will work.  I have my own ideological dealbreakers: if somebody isn't vegan, they're not an option for me, it's too large of a gulf in viewing the world for a bond based on trust and communication to be fostered.  If you can't really love a man that isn't feminist, there's no reason for that not to be a zero-level eliminator.  It's not quixotic or over restrictive, it's eminently realistic.

Luckily usually kinkster of any category are accepting of anyones individuality in every aspect anyways, so they usually have way more feminist ideals and concepts of equality i have met then in many so called ""feminist circles""  Unfortunately kink also attracts the most sore idiots of loosers you can get, these sort that have no idea of it and believe they are doms now because they have a cock and any woman is theirs to do as pleased and spout the ""all woman r subs"" bullshit, luckily they usually get quite a verbal thrashing.....  In other words, i dont see anything wrong with your choice to want something specific in a partner, you can be as specific as you like to, and if it is a must for you, who are they to judge?"
FemmeThoughts,2iqljp,LadyAlekto,18,Thu Oct 9 10:53:37 2014 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by ""feminist."" Men who call themselves feminists? Probably not that common. Men who believe in equality? Not that uncommon. Of course, there are all kinds of shades in between. I dated a guy who was more or less in favor of equality in principle, and didn't expect me to stay home with our hypothetical future children instead of pursuing my own career; but as I became more familiar with feminism myself, I started noticing things that I just couldn't ignore (e.g., sexist and racist ""jokes"" that were totally only jokes and not indicative of problematic thoughts at all, especially because his best friend was black, so there /s). They partly coincided with his latest friendships, but overall I started to realize that we were just not similar enough people to continue being together (for a multitude of other reasons as well).  Today, I am married to a man who is sometimes more of a feminist than I am. I can't tell you how great it feels not to have to explain why certain jokes are offensive.  I don't know if I can answer your question about whether you can ""teach"" a man to be a feminist, but I'll at least say some are going to take more effort than you'll be willing to give. I think it's ok to look for men who already have similar views to yours. They're really not THAT rare."
FemmeThoughts,2iqljp,turris_eburnea,10,Thu Oct 9 08:04:29 2014 UTC,"That's a really interesting question.  I actually don't know if my fiance wears the ""feminist"" label.  I don't think he has a word for what he sees: a world where men and women are treated differently, and historically women have gotten the short end of it in many ways which is totally not ok.    I think he still has a bit of that pop-culture idea about what a ""feminist"", although it's changing.  If he was completely uninterested in hearing my realities about what occurs to me and how I see that, the experiences I've had, the times I and my friends have been discriminated against because of our gender, how it feels to be afraid...I couldn't date him or marry him.  I don't care whether or not he calls himself a feminist as long as he treats all people, women included, with respect and dignity, doesn't try to erase my existance, and is willing to work with me to make a better future for everyone."

Also, I probably won't date someone new to the ideas of feminism. It's just too big a gulf.  Feminism is an important part of my life, so on those grounds alone, it would be a huge gap.  Also, if you belong to very liberal / radical orgs, it's not at all hard to find feminist men. They're the rule, not the exception.*  EDIT: Okay, sorry it depends on the org. I mean, it is very possible to find chauvenistic attitudes and sexism in liberal and radical circles. But if you choose circles that already have women's agendas and that deeply care about these things and where women are prominent leaders, then it's really not an issue."

Setting aside the fact that you are doing this to avoid the stress of a relationship without mutual respect - and that sounds like it makes things MUCH easier - I can give you my anecdotal experience that reducing the number of people you consider eligible for your affections can only make dating easier. There are a shittonne of men out there. If you are turning them down because they are just not your style in some palpable way, then that sounds not just sensible, but like you've made a choice to simplify your life considerably."

They might not be feminists themselves, or maybe feminist in name but not in practice, and feel that your exclusivity is some kind of judgment on them. From the information you provided, it sounds like your energy would be better spent talking to your friends about feminism, rather than non-feminist potential partners."

FemmeThoughts,2iqljp,so_srs,2,Thu Oct 9 15:24:22 2014 UTC,"I think you're being totally reasonable. It can be really really hard to date people who don't share your values. A good partner is someone you respect and admire. It can be hard to admire someone when you disagree with some of their major values or think they're being unfair or unreasonable.   I personally will never ever date someone who is anti-choice.  I don't make feminism a requirement (although misogyny is a deal breaker), but it's definitely a huge plus.   Values are a huge part of a person's identity. For long term relationships, it makes way more sense to priorities values other things like body size or looks."

A non-feminist hook up, sure. But a partner who can't see rampant sexism, doesn't think there's anything wrong with it, or is so foolish to trust reactionary defamations is a pretty lacking in the introspective department. If he can't even introspect something so blatantly obvious what good will he be at understanding himself and relaying that with you? Sounds like he's lacking some pretty important skills to examine himself and his culture, worldview, and perspectives critically. That might make conflict resolution more difficult.   Why would you want to date someone who discounts your experiences as a woman?  Oh also there are plenty of feminist men out there and for a relationship you don't need tons."

But there's a limit to how much I can do with that, because I spend enough time thinking about/fighting for gender equality in my public life that I'd like to have some rest and respite from it in my private world.  Mutual respect is so important to me that I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with a guy without it.  Plain and simple.  That almost always comes along with an admission of feminist leaning."

Our future children not automatically getting his last name. Me paying my share of all our dates or us taking equal turns paying for dates. Me driving him around. Me making more money than him. Me putting my career above children and household.  Me refusing to associate with people who say sexist (or bigoted or racist) things. Me not being traditionally feminine in appearance.   Etc etc. And all of that seems to require a feminist man as I've learned over the years. So no, I could never date a man who wasn't a feminist.

That's mansplaining, and it's a violation of our rules.  (Also, you might want to tone down your sweeping statements.  All males are sexist, all heterosexual relationships are oppressive, men who identify as feminist take protagonism away from women?  Men are hardly a victimised minority, and hardly need protection.

FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,hermithome,7,Thu Oct 9 02:16:28 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the response.   Its hard for me to respond to this type of view since I'm obviously bias. However, I'm genuinely curious in figuring out exactly WHY this is an issue. Forgive me if any of these questions come across as being brash. Is it that you would feel unsafe? or is it potentially triggering because the dangly bits are generally associated with men? or is it something else entirely?  If you choose to respond and find it difficult to form the right words, please feel free to use the wrong words. I have a thick skin and I'm sure you will not offend me. I'm looking for reasonings behind these view points so that I can better understand where folks such as yourself are coming from without the underlying hostility.  EDIT: I didn't address the curtain topic, only because while I understand that to be a valid option. I don't see my behavior as disrespectful, I use the facilities as intended no differently than my peers. I feel being asked to use a separate changing room is discriminatory. am I wrong in this assumption?"
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,sweetpea122,15,Thu Oct 9 02:40:16 2014 UTC,"Re dangly bits, I think the thing is, for a lot of women, an unexpected penis is a penis being used as a weapon.   Most of the time the context isn't a pre-op woman changing, it's a guy exposing himself to you, or sending an unwanted dick pic. That is, penises are really important to most men, and an unexpected exposed penis is generally associated with a man getting pleasure either despite or because of a woman is uncomfortable.  So it's less that the dangly bits are generally associated with men, and more that unexpected dangly bits are associated with men behaving badly.  Again, this is just my hypothesis though.  /u/sweetpea122, does this resonate for you?"
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,hermithome,10,Thu Oct 9 10:08:42 2014 UTC,It really does. I guess I didnt realized that I also feel negatively to most penises in general when they are out of context
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,hermithome,6,Thu Oct 9 15:31:56 2014 UTC,"I never thought of it in that sense, and it does make sense that there would be that kind of association. I can understand that perspective too and have been on the receiving end of such harassment. I'm understanding now where some of these women are coming from. How do I explain myself to them without disenfranchising their feelings? even if those feelings are negative, it does not mean they matter any less.. I think this is the real question I was digging for.   Thank you for the response."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,hermithome,13,Thu Oct 9 10:43:14 2014 UTC,"Hmm, it's hard. Someone else mentioned this downthread, but part of the problem is that women are already told not to trust their instincts and feelings and to squash them. We're socialised to behave. Which makes women very protective of women only areas, because they feel it's all they have. And when someone is defensive, asserting that they are wrong and that you have rights just gets them to stick their back further up a wall.  I think that's why there's a real disconnect between how people treat you in real life, and how people perceive being told about this. Especially because they are probably disinclined to truely believe that the lack of reaction you've gotten is how these women really feel. I'd guess that they feel that other women are probably swallowing discomfort, or that you're simply blithly unaware of their discomfort, and so they don't trust your story. They don't trust you to respect the discomfort of other women (again, something strongly associated with men). And when they voice discomfort, and you assert your rights, that's a confirmation for them.  It's a toxic trap, and I'm really not sure there is a solution. I think the more we make strides in terms of everyday misogyny, and the more that women feel entitled to larger, more open spaces, the more this spectre will go away.  The only thing I can think is to be a bit more deferrential, so that they feel safer and can come around? Maybe explain that you know the idea makes many women unusually uncomfortable, and you understand where that comes from. Show an understanding of the idea that an unexpected penis is a weapon, and that you understand that women only places are often the only places women feel free from having their emotions policed. And that you respect their discomfort, and understand if it's maybe something they can't quite grasp or trust when being told to them. And then tell them your good experiences. Say that fortunately this hasn't been an issue in meatspace. That when other women see you as you, an authentic, genuine person, and not as a scary idea of a disembodied walking penis, that they have no issue and are nice and friendly. And that you hope they have the good fortune you have had- to have a gym changing environment where everyone is comfortable and washes off sweat in harmony. That they have the fortune to be accepted and be as accepting. And that you understand if they don't quite trust your experiences, but hope that your relaying them will give them comfort that this isn't an issue. (but understand, that for many, this is the first time the issue might be raised for them, and that they will kneejerk react poorly anyway).  I think maybe giving them that mental space, where they don't feel it forced on them might help them to avoid doubling down. And if the conversation does upset them or disturb them, show that you respect those feelings by leaving it lie.   Unfortunatly it's going to take time and emotional connections to change people's minds. I think the best you can do is to present the idea in as non-threatening a way as possible, say that you understand where they're coming from but fortunately, it's not like that. Validating their feelings and not pushing them is probably the best way to get them to ease off the throttle. That's both because confrontation makes people double down and more certain in their beliefs, and because behaviour wise, that's gender coded language. Women are often the ones to push down their own feelings and validate others. To women who are terrified that you will come into their spaces and force them to push down their feelings to validate you, validation and respect is probably the best thing you can give them to feel safe.   I mean, it sucks that you have validate other people's feelings when those feelings are driving oppressive behaviour, but it's the most pracatical, results oriented approach I can provide."

I never had the upbringing most women have, so being on this side of the fence is a learning experience. This has been some of the most well written explanations I've ever encountered, thank you for the time you contributed to this and for remaining unbiased. As I was reading it, I couldn't help but compare this to the thought of explaining a different religion to someone else of a different faith.

I probably wouldn't have dared to set foot on the premises of the gym if it wasn't for her. I was legitimately terrified the first few times I used the locker room.

Let them know that you understand their fears, and that this is not that. Gauge the situation to see how to handle it. Maybe with a mild joke ""hey, I don't like it much either"", maybe just softly and calmly.  Also, if you're tall, be . . . less tall? Don't slouch, but stand softly? Acckk, this is something I can totally demonstrate, but cannot at all find good words for.   The part is, that socially, we're not that far from seeing penises as the dreaded one eyed snake. Sure, sexual liberation has changed a lot of things, sex is seen as less sinful, and women enjoying sex is seen as less sinful, but penises are far too often still weapons. You have to communicate that you understand that they see it as a weapon and empathise with that. Get them to see you as a separate entity from the penis.  Oh, also, listen. If they're sputtering and angry and scared, let them get out what they need to say. Not just don't interrupt or talk over them, but listen and find the right space in which to reply.   And validate their fears. It's weird, but the best way to show them that their fears aren't valid is to listen to them, understand them and recognise them. Someone who understands and respects my fear is someone who won't cross that. Someone who doesn't is liable to hurt me and not notice. The difference is in listening actively and validating.   its just making sure I'm able to convey proper empathy when making statements and standing up for what is right without asserting my beliefs/opinions as fact. Its an extremely delicate balance that you've shown to understand. Thank you for the lovely conversation ^ _ ;;   It's a delicate balance, but you do an excellent job. I've really enjoyed talking to you, and would love to talk to you again. I'm incredibly fascinated by socialisation and the ways we learn to respond to people, so this is a lot of fun for me :).   Thank you. And I respect you too. This has been a really amazing conversation."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,sweetpea122,6,Thu Oct 9 22:11:48 2014 UTC,"I don't want to see anyone naked and strolling around a locker room. It's not ""you have dangly bits"" it's a ""I don't want to see any bits at all if possible."" So politeness of changing away from main aisles, not walking around naked, use of curtains when possible is appreciated for all women, trans and cis."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,hermithome,2,Thu Oct 9 13:37:19 2014 UTC,"From my perspective, I just don't really like seeing unfamiliar penises. In general, I just like my husbands and don't really like to see them in unexpected places. Especially not in circumstances where Im expecting to see things that I have.   It is the ""dangly"" bits lol, that I personally would be shocked to see in a ladies locker room.   Edit: also to address your edit, I think that it is unfair for you to redefine the rules for ladies locker rooms. I don't think you should be asked to use a curtain, I think you're allowed to use the facilities because no one has a problem with it at your gym. I feel that by you trying to assert what you feel is a right, you are opening up the possiblity of my comfort being trampled on. What would stop a weirdo from coming into the locker rooms and saying he's trans to watch women change? I mean it's not that crazy of an idea. I would personally just prefer no pre-op trans people in the locker rooms. If you do, it's a privilege and not a right."

I don't agree with that. It is a right, even if they haven't gone through with a surgery. Not all trans want to, or are financially or physically able to. That doesn't change who they are, though. Now, to flaunt it...no. Please don't make me uncomfortable in my space. But you having those bits behind your curtain or closed bathroom door...I could care less."

I'm not sorry about who I am, I wish I wasn't discriminated against for my physical body type, I can't help that. However, because my body is a woman's body, my penis is a woman's penis.

FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,hermithome,10,Thu Oct 9 03:17:21 2014 UTC,"I have absolutely no problem with transwomen using changing rooms.   However, genitals are the thing. For cis women, you generally just see boobs and mons pubis. Not the actual labia/vagina, etc. You aren't getting a full frontal view of everything.  For pre-op transwomen, the whole having an external sex organ thing is a lot more visually intrusive.  I don't want to see anyone's genitals, cis or trans."

(If so, note that the number of trans men working there as trainers/fitness is crazy.  It's super corporate but weirdly trans friendly as a result.).    Seriously, the only reason anyone considers the issue of bathrooms/change rooms is as a straw man.  I am in a gym change room at least twice/day, and I don't think I have ever seen another woman's nether regions uncovered.  If I saw your genitalia uncovered, it's exposure is more notable than its configuration.    And on an aside, the way you're framing the question is slightly creepy...  Everyone is discrete in change rooms.  You should be as discrete as anyone else as a matter of cultural norms, not because you're packing a strapless."

Like I said in another comment, I use the facility no differently than my peers (most of which do not cover themselves). My experiences are only drawn from using this one facility.

If I saw your genitalia uncovered, it's exposure is more notable than its configuration.   It depends largely on the place though. I've been in gym locker rooms where women changed in private or used towels to keep themselves covered and only a few older women let it all hang out. And I've been in gym locker rooms where everyone is walking around totally naked, and where shower rooms are communal, so you not only see everyones bits, you see them scrub them."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,batmansock,4,Thu Oct 9 03:23:38 2014 UTC,"The gym I go to, most of the woman walk around uncovered and those that cover themselves are notably a minority. However, the showers themselves are individual stalls (although, calling them stalls doesn't really do it justice)."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,PembrdWelshCorgi,6,Thu Oct 9 10:11:25 2014 UTC,I wouldn't want to see a penis in the changing room. But I always wouldn't want to see someone else's vagina or boobs either. So I normally just don't pay attention haha. You do you!
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,PembrdWelshCorgi,13,Thu Oct 9 10:48:21 2014 UTC,"There's a bit to unravel here.  Women who frequent online spaces tend (justifiably) to develop a heightened sense of self-preservation in the face of perceived male entitlement, in all its forms. I think this might explain the strength of the reactions you're getting online.   Now, clearly, you are not a man.   However, there's room here for someone posing as a person in your position to concoct a strawman argument. What's to prevent a cis-man from falsely claiming trans-status, and demanding equal usage of the women's facilities for his own voyeuristic gratification?  And I suspect that online - where people can't really engage with you - the woman going about her business in the locker room like everyone else, but must engage with a person who says she's a woman but visibly appears male when naked and also demands the right to be around naked women ...   and that demanding point is key - you're certainly correct to demand to be treated equally to any other woman, but women have a lot of history dealing with folks with penises making demands specifically with regard to access to their naked bodies, or attempting to force those women to respond to said penises regardless of their desire to participate, and it's a very loaded dynamic.   It doesn't make it right for people to get so angry with you online, but I think that collective memory combined with the inability to gauge your sincerity is what's causing it. (And it would explain why people don't have a problem with the real you in person.)  Personally, I don't care what you look like or how much you're wearing; all of my pet peeves are behavioral. Don't stare at anyone, don't try to draw my attention to you for some one-sided reason, don't spread your stuff all over the place as though you're the only one there, and put your cell phone away. I don't want to hear your conversation, or unintentionally photobomb your selfie.  [edited to add phrasing that includes the exhibitionist side of things, since that's also an issue, in addition to voyeurism.]"
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,PembrdWelshCorgi,4,Thu Oct 9 07:32:53 2014 UTC,Its scary that a strawman argument is a thing D:   You and I share the same exact pet peeves x _ x;; its basic bathroom etiquette..
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,isleepinahammock,2,Thu Oct 9 04:52:55 2014 UTC,"I mentioned this to hermithome, but I wanted to thank you directly as well - you've been so open and hopeful in this entire thread.   You're a lovely soul; thank you for being exactly who you are."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,PembrdWelshCorgi,1 point,Thu Oct 9 09:26:15 2014 UTC,"No need to thank me for that blossom, it takes an old soul to recognize another. <3  as an aside, I seriously wish this was a legit round table discussion. I'd buy everyone a drink for being so awesome."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,hermithome,8,Thu Oct 9 23:25:54 2014 UTC,"Yes, exactly. I said something really similar above. It's less that a penis is associated with male, and more the associations with bad behaviour that's a problem for most people."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,PembrdWelshCorgi,5,Fri Oct 10 00:26:02 2014 UTC,"Right, exactly.   It's hard to unpack, because penises are also closely associated/conflated with maleness, but in this context, it isn't the male-ness that's the issue.   As an illustration, beards are just about equally taken as a sure sign of masculinity. But they are not used as a tool of abuse - so if OP were discussing walking into the locker room presenting somewhat like Conchita Wurst, I don't think the reactions would be anywhere near as strong; unexpected/unwanted penises are uniquely triggering because of their associations with specifically damaging types of abusive behavior perpetuated by men, but not because of their associations with men in general.   Also, as an aside, I think you beautifully explained the socialization differences and resulting communication difficulties upthread. It's such a tricky thing to discuss, and both you and OP are absolutely lovely."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,sweetpea122,4,Thu Oct 9 10:15:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah, absolutely. I've seen plenty of bearded ladies in locker rooms, mostly older women who don't give a shit and rock some awesome beards. I was surprised the first time I saw this, because I was a little kid and didn't know women could have beards (I think I mentioned this above), and because they were so awesome and carefree about it.   And I think without the socialisation aspect, the reaction to a penis would be similar. Ooh, what's that? Okay, cool, whatever.    Also, as an aside, I think you beautifully explained the socialization differences and resulting communication difficulties upthread. It's such a tricky thing to discuss, and both you and OP are absolutely lovely.   So you are. This is such an awesome thread. I'm so happy."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,isleepinahammock,7,Thu Oct 9 23:22:55 2014 UTC,"I've been in that situation before, and I didn't honestly give a shit. I mean, really, if we're going to stop people changing in the open because it makes people uncomfortable, I'm just as uncomfortable around naked people with vaginas. I don't go to the locker room to look at anyone's jennies, you know? Like, as long as you're not being creepy (which should be a basic requirement for locker rooms anyway) I don't understand why it's an issue."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,sweetpea122,5,Fri Oct 10 00:00:41 2014 UTC,I totally feel you on that and which is why I'm so confused when I am approached with hostility about it online. I do my best to mind my own business and expect the same of those around me. I can't tell you how many times I've been painted as some sort of deviant from those that have never seen me or have ill-conceived notions that because I'm trans I must be some sort of monster.
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,isleepinahammock,7,Thu Oct 9 03:11:02 2014 UTC,"It's really weird- like, the people insisting that having trans women there would make them uncomfortable are way more invested in looking at other people naked in the locker room than they ought to be."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,enigma5908,2,Thu Oct 9 03:32:13 2014 UTC,"Well, some people are uncomfortable with nudity in general. I used to be really freaked out by the idea of changing in locker rooms, and I was freaked out by nudity in general.  Then I spent some time in Korean bathhouses and got the hell over that super quick :)"
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,sweetpea122,3,Thu Oct 9 03:54:07 2014 UTC,"It would not bother me at all to see a pre-op transwoman in a change room.  I don't know how to explain my opinion because I dont' know why I am not bothered by it, I'm just not."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,hermithome,6,Thu Oct 9 10:13:59 2014 UTC,"Honestly, many of these comments are pretty trans phobic, which is surprising and upsetting to me."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,sweetpea122,2,Thu Oct 9 07:51:12 2014 UTC,"Right you are. I don't want to call folks out on it at the moment, purely because I'm aiming to understand their viewpoint."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,SweetNyan,2,Thu Oct 9 18:28:28 2014 UTC,I guess this is exactly what you mean by online attitudes vs real-world experience. I hope your gym experiences continue being awesome! And hopefully the shittiness in this thread isn't indicative of this sub as a whole.
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,sweetpea122,6,Thu Oct 9 18:54:37 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I'm sure this isn't a indicative at all. Folks have stepped out of their comfort zone to express something that is potentially triggering. I understand how it can be triggering and I also realize that it is mostly embedded in misunderstanding and fear. I'm not upset at the reactions. I only get upset when someone goes out of their way to deny me my basic civil liberties or slanders me, etc... The best way to prove I'm not a threat, is to be a lighthouse and to be an upstanding human within the community. Sometimes bringing attention to ones-self can be beneficial it setting a positive example. If I am able to have someone actually think about the question and just have it there on their minds, I'm happy. I'm much more tolerant of transphobia than most, but I also believe that kindness will get you farther than hostility. Especially when trying to prove you're not a threat. I am a feminist through and through, equality for all sans violence."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,SweetNyan,8,Thu Oct 9 19:06:15 2014 UTC,"Yes, they are. And in fact, many would normally not be allowed on this subreddit. But OP specifically asked for people to speak honestly and explain their feelings and their fears.   We hope, and I believe that the learning, respect and conversation that is happening here is worth it. If you see any comment crossing the line, or think that a thread is getting out of hand, please, please, report the comment and message the moderators.  Thanks"
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,SweetNyan,3,Thu Oct 9 19:46:17 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. I realize OP asked for the sub's opinion, but I wasn't sure of the mods' stance and commented because I felt like it was the right thing to do.

FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,SweetNyan,2,Thu Oct 9 22:28:08 2014 UTC,"No problem. We have pretty strong anti-bigotry rules here, and we enforce them. Which means that users who hold these sorts of opinions simply don't share them on those sorts of threads. They respect the rules even if they feel differently, and respect our users enough to let them have their space.  This is an unusual case as the OP is explicitly asking for opinions, especially those of people who are transphobic. Which means that we're allowing those sorts of opinions. They still need to be respectful about it, but we make an exception.   It's a different situation and the mods and users respond differently. There are several comments on this thread that would normally be downvoted, reported and removed. But none of that has happened, in fact, many have been upvoted. Because we, the community, respect that people are openly sharing their opinions when asked, and contributing to a respectful dialogue and greater understanding.  We hope you enjoy the sub, and please, if you do ever see something that is a problem (not just on this thread, but whenever), report it and if you have the time, send a modmail.  Thanks :)"
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,sweetpea122,6,Thu Oct 9 22:37:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I can understand people being hesitant, but at the same time, people should be mature enough to realize that trans women are women and belong in the women's changing room just like anyone else.  Now, I could see some reasonable guidelines such as:  -If pre-op, keep things covered up as much as possible, realizing that some people may be uncomfortable.   -Before switching to the female changing room, be on hormones long enough that some noticeable level of feminization occurs.   The latter prevents actual guys from sneaking in just by pretending they're trans. No one's going to go to the trouble of seeing a psych, going on hormones, having their entire body chemistry change, and say growing breasts, just for the sake of sneaking in the changing room.  I think surgery is way too high a requirement, as many trans people can't get or don't want it for various reasons, but hormones are a much more reasonable bar. And I'm saying this as a trans gal myself."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,SweetNyan,6,Thu Oct 9 22:53:28 2014 UTC,"I disagree and believe every woman should be allowed to change in the locker room, without putting limits on any sort of ""acceptable"" line. This boogeyman issue of a man pretending to be trans shouldn't be a reason to make trans women feel uncomfortable or unwelcome in a women's space. Placing different rules on different women just doesn't seem right, to me.  Thanks for sharing your thoughts."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,sweetpea122,5,Thu Oct 9 19:46:42 2014 UTC,"Only a half on topic reply, because your comment reminded me of something else on the topic.  Men pretending to be trans is not an actually issue, but men going into women's locker rooms is.   Obviously, this will be vastly different based on the place and how many people are there, but I've walked into empty women's locker rooms and found a man changing for the lulz. Or I've been changing in an empty / near empty room and had a man walk in.  I don't think any men would pretend to be trans, but I do think that pre-op trans women need to guard against an instanteous reaction to a male body. Meaning that, if you're pre-op, being on hormones, or even just dressing in a feminised way instantly signals that you're not the stupid arsehole who thinks it's hilarious to walk into the women's changing room, start to change and then pretend you only realise halfway through.  I know there's a serious issue in the trans community with heavy duty gender policing (being properly feminine, wearing makeup, all that). I'm aware of that and don't want to play into that. But, if you're pre-op, doing something to signal that you are not a man is important. That is, a pre-op woman who isn't yet on hormones / can't take hormones and prefers to dress in a so-called ""butch"" fashion will instantly be read as a man. Yes, it's unfair gender policing, but if you're in this position I suggest dressing for these occasions differently, as a way to communicate non-verbally (and of course, as a safety precaution).  Also, I should mention that men walking into women's changing rooms is in large part, a class issue. Poorer people go to public pools with public changing rooms that aren't monitored and anyone can walk in. This likely isn't an issue for OP, who is specifically going to a gym and has a membership and so on."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,SweetNyan,6,Thu Oct 9 20:48:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughts and your perspective. I'd never looked at the problem through the lens of classism, but that definitely makes a lot of sense."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,allrattedup,6,Thu Oct 9 22:27:03 2014 UTC,"I generally agree with a lot of your view points, but this one I can't. The form of ""reasonable guidelines"" sounds innocent enough, but it is discriminatory, and at its core; transphobia. This also goes back to the mentality of ""woman must cover themselves because..."" attitude and is a poor choice of policing. I don't like it. You wouldn't ask that if a ciswoman, why would you of a transwoman. That is not feminism."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,allrattedup,1 point,Thu Oct 9 22:45:19 2014 UTC,"I completely agree with you and Im the one that is being labeled as transphobic and honestly I felt a little bullied by stating that i would prefer the basic policies that you just suggested. And by policies, I mean that loosely.   I feel completely misrespresented because i can tell that user's are talking about me in an indirect way. I was asked a question, gave my opinion, and then it was like I was forced into defending the positions I already gave responses to. And now I'm labeled transphobic? I feel that it's pretty hypocritical to ask that I be understanding and see male body parts differently while being called a bigot in the same breath, being patronized, and offhandedly disrespected in this sub."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,hermithome,4,Thu Oct 9 22:46:42 2014 UTC,"I'm so sorry, I never intended to call you anything or label you. I did ask you step outside your comfort zone and express an opposing viewpoint. I'm sorry if some of my responses felt like bullying. I'm not going to make excuses as to why that might have happened. Your opinions and concerns are valid and I sincerely appreciate you voicing them. You are a good person, I believe that through and through. Again, sorry if I pushed anything on you in any way.  EDIT: adding to this  If at any point I come across as bullying or too pushy, please, PLEASE, let me know. I've re-read over some my comments and I think I know which ones you're referring to. You are entitled to your opinion and I never meant any of my responses to come off as an attack to your personal conservations. If they did, I truly am sorry and going forward I will place even more thought on the words I use."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,hella_elle,7,Fri Oct 10 04:50:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I meant it more as guidelines trans women would want to follow than some rules that should be imposed on them. I understand gender isn't about what's between your legs, but come on, be realistic. There's a huge difference between saying, ""hey, I realize I have ""boy parts"" but can you look past that and let me use the restroom in peace,"" and ""you should have absolutely no problem seeing a penis in the women's dressing room. If a woman can walk around fully naked without making any attempt to cover herself, then I should be able to flaunt my penis as well!""   I'm post-op now, so this issue is really behind me, but god, when I was pre-op, I can't even imagine wanting people to see my bits, especially in a female space. Even if I had decided not to get surgery, I really wouldn't consider it unreasonable to say, ""hey, if it's possible to cover up, cover up.""   And I also don't see what's wrong with putting some reasonable guidelines about either being on hormones or at least dressing as female before you use the women's restroom. As others have said, pervs pretending to be trans is actually unheard of, but pervs in general wandering into women's changing rooms is not. When someone walks in to a women's changing room, the people inside need to have at least some sort of indication that the person is actually trans and not just some perv.  Now, I understand that not all trans people can do these things, but if you're not on hormones, if you're not dressing, if you're not doing anything that actually openly shows your identified gender, I see no reason why a trans gal can't just use the boy's changing room while still in the invisible stage. Ultimately, changing rooms are about safety. If a trans gal is still completely visibly male, she won't face any problem in the boy's room, and she'll only be in there a few minutes anyway.  When I started transition, I didn't just up and one day start walking into women's restrooms. Transition is a slow process, and when I still dressed as male and showed no outward signs of femininity, I just kept using the boy's room. It didn't kill me, and I don't see why other women should just take my word for it that I belong in the girl's room if I'm not making any effort to show that I belong there."
FemmeThoughts,2ipu1u,notenoughtokillme,4,Fri Oct 10 09:20:35 2014 UTC,"Thank you for understanding my point. Well obviously you lived it so you get the both side to the problem. I feel like the people getting down on me for my comments, want to be accepted as a woman, but won't accept my concerns as a woman. I would feel completely uncomfortable as a woman with man parts visible in our locker room. I really wouldnt care if it was a transwoman being conservative and respectful about how women may feel uncomfortable in that situation. I don't like how in certain parts of Lgbt community, if you express an opposing opinion you're completely off base, a bigot, and just a terrible person. Im really not a bad person. Im pretty decent. People in that community also want to be treated like a decent person too. We have that in common. I just don't think it furthers discussion or understanding when you can't express your feelings or concerns because everyone shuts down. I want my voice to be heard too, but it will be drowned out when everyone thinks Im not progressive.   I know it's hard to be a transwoman. It's also hard to be a regular woman. I've been flashed, I've had my home broken into in the ghetto as a 12 year old because a heroin addict thought my house was a whore house, i've been assaulted, I've been called names, put down. Shit, this isnt just a trans thing. People from the trans community also need to see where others are coming from and we can all create compromises. Those who can't compromise arent helping the cause.  Obviously, I don't want trans women to feel uncomfortable but I don't want me or other women to feel uncomfortable either. I feel it's a tad unreasonable to say ""well if other women don't have to cover up, then why should I?"" I've found that open discussion turn out better when people respect other's view points."

FemmeThoughts,2ioob9,Shaysdays,27,Wed Oct 8 20:05:16 2014 UTC,"Seriously you're perfectly fine! It's ""common knowledge"" that all teenage boys are horny but it's not always true. And it's forgetting about us horny girls!  I'm 21, and I would be having sex like three times a day (morning, after class/work, and nighttime before bed) minimal, if I could! I'm literally always horny! The only reason I don't is because my boyfriend's libido is much lower than mine.   It's silly that everyone kind of decided that boys want lots of sex and girls don't. It's dumb. Don't believe this going into adult life because it's a lie. If a man doesn't want sex at the drop of a hat, it isn't because he doesn't find you attractive (this took me a while, kinda shot my self esteem), it's because not every man is a sex crazed maniac. And just because you are sex crazed and you happen to be a woman, it doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Some women just like sex, or even just the idea of being so intimate with a partner, or even just having orgasms! Whatever!  You can want sex as much as you want! If it starts negatively affecting you physically or mentally or in your relationships with other people then maybe you have a problem. But just thinking about sex, fantasizing about some of your friends or crushes, that's super normal (at least for me and many many of my friends that I've talked to).  Don't worry, you do you and take things at a pace that's comfortable for you!"
FemmeThoughts,2ioob9,onlykindagreen,8,Wed Oct 8 20:56:51 2014 UTC,totally normal! enjoy it now while you can because you might lose the drive if you ever go on hormonal birth control.
FemmeThoughts,2ioob9,LevyWife,9,Wed Oct 8 20:18:40 2014 UTC,"Oh god my sex drive is insane. It always has been. Don't feel bad about it, it's a total myth that guys are the horny ones. Truth is almost everyone wants to experiment, and everyone has sexual needs.   I've been called a slut/whore etc. For having sex with people I wasn't dating(like friends with benefits type deals) and because I've never been ashamed about my sexuality. It was hurtful in my younger years, but now idgaf. Actually I feel bad for people who have to resort to name calling over something as natural as sex.   As long as you're being safe(using condoms, regular trips to the gyno), you shouldn't be worried about anything! My relationship is the complete opposite of ""traditional"" sex wise. I'm the wild, horny, experimental one and he's not. He used to joke that I'm ""trapped in a teenage boys body"" and I said ""no I'm accepting of my 24 year old female body, take off your pants!""   Now go get it girl, nothing to feel weird/bad /ashamed of!"

If one looks at this shit as sober as possible, then there is no difference between guys and gals of who wants more or less, it all depends on the person :)"
FemmeThoughts,2ioob9,Waterrat,3,Thu Oct 9 00:01:19 2014 UTC,"Oh sweetie, let it go, let it go! You are woman, and with that comes the fire of sexuality. I happen to think my women friends are much raunchier than my male friends. Explore, be safe, fantasize lots, find some toys, so much more!"
FemmeThoughts,2ioob9,twistedfork,3,Thu Oct 9 01:13:20 2014 UTC,"Totally normal! I was like you when I was younger. My libido waned a bit in my 30's but I blame that on lack of attraction to my then husband. When I split up with him I found my desire for sex returned and I had a renewed enjoyment of masturbation.  Now that I am in another long term relationship, my partner and I have sex at least once everyday, more often if our schedule permits.  Sexuality is a very individual thing but rest assured, there is nothing wrong with your interest."

I'm in a long term long distance relationship and those photos we share are so intimate and really so intended for an audience of one. I used to be so scared of someone getting a hold or accidentally getting them, and then I slowly realized that I had no reason to be ashamed if that did happen."
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,friedaceleste,16,Tue Oct 7 20:29:00 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely no offense meant towards people in long distance relationships--it's a totally reasonable explanation and I think easily explains why so many actresses would have all these nude photos on their phones.  I just wish she didn't feel obligated to offer any explanation at all. She doesn't need one. When I was a kid I secretly took Polaroids of myself naked out of curiosity. People take pictures of themselves, maybe sometimes those pictures are naked and/or sexual. It's fine and no one has to explain themselves for doing that!"

FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,SomeOldGoat,6,Tue Oct 7 21:10:24 2014 UTC,"not at all :) I think you're totally right that she shouldn't even need to feel like she had to explain and justify.

I'm down."
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,friedaceleste,60,Tue Oct 7 21:13:07 2014 UTC,"I don't get why people in the comments section (and on reddit, of course) are saying this isn't a sex crime. It may not be legally defined as one--but the fact is, these photos were stolen and used for a sexual purpose, against the will of the people in the photos. It doesn't lessen the seriousness of rape or physical sexual assault to say the photo hacking, and any kind of distribution of sexual images without the permission of the subjects, is a sexual crime."
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,glibly17,37,Tue Oct 7 17:30:45 2014 UTC,"I think when things occur in the digital space, people can't seem to grasp the implications of what it means in the real world. The translation is lost because it's ""the interwebs, lolz.""   This is why (until recently) internet bullying isn't as big of an issue as real life bullying; why people can be horrible to each other behind anonymous usernames; and why the NSA isn't being persecuted legally for basically spying on its citizens.   If we translated these issues to real life: getting beat up & ostracized at school everyday; saying shitty things to someone in real life and having to see their reactions; and the NSA basically installing cameras and microphones in your home, watching your every move to make sure you ""are not a terrorist"" then yeah, people would get it.  We really need the government (USA) to start treating many of these online crimes as real life crimes."
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,xaynie,15,Tue Oct 7 19:15:27 2014 UTC,"This is a good observation, and also speaks to the skepticism many people have towards friendships and other relationships that begin on the internet. They simply don't see the personal connection."

Nobody can deny that it's at least sexual degradation achieved through committing crimes.

Thank you for being trustworthy enough for me to share this with you, and thank you for trusting me enough to share back.""   I can't imagine what it must be like for these actresses and models with their army of handlers who always have to be ""on"" all the time, who have to fight for their privacy and deal with papparazi, tabloids, invasive questions, being put through the wringer for everything they say that's not perfect.

FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,so_srs,7,Tue Oct 7 20:01:29 2014 UTC,Maybe you are right. Either way it's meant for people who want to hear a reason why she made the pictures. A long-term long-distance relationship is a reason people can understand from within the traditional framework of things. When she would've said she just did some casual sexting or uploaded the pics just for herself people would relativize her fate even more.
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,dedededede,11,Tue Oct 7 20:23:52 2014 UTC,"My thought is that it possibly comes from a place of internalised sexism in terms of porn and sex.   I'm not saying she's sexist because I highly doubt she is but in my experience with porn and men a lot of the women in my life have been anti-porn in relationships because they view it as an affront to the relationship and like ""he doesn't love me"". My own mother told me to break up with my SO if he watches porn (I totally didn't because I actually watch more than he does ironically) but I don't view porn as an evil to be fought against."
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,dedededede,9,Tue Oct 7 21:55:57 2014 UTC,"I agree with your sentiments regarding porn. But I also think porn currently exists in some kind of sociocultural vacuum. This is why we should view porn critically (literally and in society). Porn is usually just consumed, there is no real public education in watching porn nor stigma-free accessible places for critical reflection. Sex is still a taboo topic. In such a setting porn is primarily defined by monetary interests and more or less unreflected desires of consumers. This is not a good basis for a cultural product.  (Of course [or rather hopefully] the situation improves steadily, I just found this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porn_Studies / http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rprn20/current)"
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,notwantedonthevoyage,12,Tue Oct 7 22:44:15 2014 UTC,"Oh I agree.   I've very much pro-porn and sex education. I'm actually from New Zealand and our sex ed is similar to the states in many ways but different in others - herpes anyone? I'm also a kinkster so having a good knowledge of what porn and sex really is, is important to me. When my SO and I have children they are going to be taught everything that children and adolescents are not being taught. Like I said porn isn't an evil, it's how it's made and consumed by our society that is the evil part we need to fix."
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,codayus,4,Tue Oct 7 23:17:49 2014 UTC,"Can you elaborate on the ""herpes"" comment? I'm curious what the differences in sex education are (Canadian here)."
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,notwantedonthevoyage,2,Wed Oct 8 04:29:22 2014 UTC,"I can answer this one.  NZ sex ed is generally mediocre; very much the ""don't have unprotected sex, use condoms, use birth control, STDs are bad, condoms are good, here's how a condom goes on a banana, the end"".  Which is okay, but given how complex a subject it is, leaves a lot out; some quick rundowns on erogenous zones, how healthy sexual relationships work, what normal sex drive ranges are, how it's okay to be asexual, maybe an overview of what being trans is all about, some discussion of orgasms, a quick rundown of the way porn gives a inaccurate view of sex, etc., would all be welcome, but hey, it's high school.  Probably about the best you can hope for.  What they don't do—and what the US does do—is make a big thing out of herpes.  Herpes is very very common, and honestly pretty trivial.  In fact, the entire idea that herpes was an STD at all was essentially invented by Burroughs Wellcome in order to sell drugs, and seized upon by abstinence advocates as one more tool to scare teenagers with.  So if your sex ed featured graphic slides about how if you ever touch another human being outside of marriage your geneitals will turn red and fall off due to the dreade herp', congratulations!  You got US style sex ed.  If your sex ed mostly talked about pregnancy and actual serious STDs like HIV and such, then you should feel lucky.  :)  (Note:  I'm exaggerating a little.  For one thing, there's wide variance in sex ed from school to school.  But generally speaking going nuts about herpes is a US thing.)"
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,AppleSpicer,2,Thu Oct 9 06:24:26 2014 UTC,"Hey, thank you! I was curious because I feel like I got little to no sex ed -- not even the scary ""don't have sex or you'll definitely get pregnant/die"" but just...nothing. I also have herpes and I feel like I knew little to nothing about it before I got it. I know this is common for lots of so-called ""diseases"" or ""ailments,"" but it really feels like I got nothing when there's supposed to be a whole class pretty much devoted to education about these kinds of things. I was just wondering why ""herpes,"" of all things, was singled out as an indication of New Zealand doing things differently. Thanks for your in-depth reply!"
FemmeThoughts,2ikl7c,hermithome,3,Fri Oct 10 04:45:43 2014 UTC,I thought this way for many years until I was in a relationship with a man where both of realized we had really fucked up sexualities from a lot of societal influences and needed to masturbate without porn or any pictures. I chalk it up to internalized sexism and harmful social influences about sex and sexuality.  That she assumes that she needs to create sexual pictures so that her SO won't look at other women is a problem. That she can't imagine any other way is depressing.

I finally just sent her a very long message detailing out why I didn't want to be friends with her while trying not to insult her. I told her that she'd assaulted a friend at a party and not respected my boundaries either. I told her I didn't agree with the way she viewed other women's bodies and 'skinny shamed' them, because she was insecure about her weight (the whole real women have curves). I told her how I felt being a girl who grew up a stick with no curves and was insulted by many women who were jealous of that. I also pointed out the fact I had tried to talk to her about all these points and was ignored or she argued with me.  After sending that message, I told myself I wouldn't respond to anything she said. This wasn't a debate. This was me just stating why I no longer wanted to be her friend. She of course exploded and told me she had no idea what I was talking about, but she got the point and hasn't bothered with me since."

Maybe don't have the automod reply to any post you aren't willing to autodelete (like non-np reddit links). PMs (if technically possible) might better meet the goal of raising awareness without irking people reading threads."
FemmeThoughts,2ihfrx,so_srs,2,Mon Oct 6 20:48:47 2014 UTC,"PMs are technically possible. In fact, we already do some things that way, like the welcome PM, which has been mentioned elsewhere.   Another thing we could do, is change the rule so that it would ignore comments that included the words ""transcript"" or ""description"". So if you already included one, and prefaced it, it wouldn't reply at all.  And we could change the message it sends to let people know about this. Also, we could change the message to be a PM instead of a comment.  We chose comments first for visibility, and hoped that enough people would catch on quickly enough that we could remove them altogether. But most people still seem to need the reminder, and at the same time, the awareness is already there."
FemmeThoughts,2ihfrx,Shaysdays,7,Tue Oct 7 08:04:48 2014 UTC,I am not gonna lie- I thought it was a troll bothering people when I saw it was asking for a transcript of a gif of a woman sighing.
FemmeThoughts,2ihfrx,Shaysdays,3,Tue Oct 7 01:38:09 2014 UTC,"Can you expand on that? Why did you jump to the conclusion of ""troll""? Generally, the name of the user, and the little ""I am a bot"" disclaimer come accross pretty clearly, and we try and word the messages in a particular way as well."
FemmeThoughts,2ihfrx,maerad,3,Tue Oct 7 08:24:10 2014 UTC,"Because it seemed like something a troll would do- ask everyone for clarification even if there was literally almost none to be had. If I wanted to annoy people, asking them to explain almost everything they posted would be an easy start. A username and ""this is a bot"" is not something someone couldn't just write.  If someone is blind and browsing, what good is explaining ""woman looks away and sighs"" to them? Maybe you should focus on asking whether or not the vision impaired people here think it's adding to the conversation, honestly. As someone with seriously bad vision, it's just clunking up the place. I can see a gif easier than I can read text anyway."
FemmeThoughts,2ihfrx,maerad,2,Tue Oct 7 12:54:00 2014 UTC,"It's a distinguished comment coming from a moderator of the subreddit, even if it is from a bot. Sure, maybe this would be some weird troll's idea of fun, and maybe they'd decide to impersonate a bot, but we wouldn't make them a moderator.  You're reaction to the comment suggests that perhaps it would be better if the bot continued to leave comments instead of switching to PMs. At least with a comment, the bot is clearly speaking a moderator.   And you seem to fundamentally misunderstand the comment the bot leaves. The bot doesn't ask for clarification; we're quite aware that anyone who can see a reaction gif will understand it. The bot asks for translation, so that that communication is something that's available for everyone on this subreddit.  Memes and reaction gifs are often used in place of conversation. If someone comments by leaving a gif, the person who can't see the gif had no idea what they said. It would be one thing if it was just a few comments, but it's not. And people often reply to these threads, and they start conversations. Conversations that you can't follow if you have no idea what people are referring to.  You can see a gif easier than you can read a text, great, then the translation is not intended for you.  Its usefulness to you is not an issue.  We instituted these changes not sure how many people they would help, and we almost instanteously had feedback from people that this affected who thanked us for making these changes.   If you have more questions or complains about accessibility, please message the moderators. This thread is about how we use automoderator, and that only."
FemmeThoughts,2ihfrx,maerad,7,Tue Oct 7 21:37:33 2014 UTC,"The media posts anytime someone wants to just link an imgur image in the comments are annoying.  I like the ""hey, you're new here!"" type automod posts, though."
FemmeThoughts,2ihfrx,satanslandlady,3,Mon Oct 6 22:01:40 2014 UTC,Would PMs regarding linked media be preferrable?  EDIT: I should note that PMs will only work if people actually edit their posts to include transcripts / descriptions. The other advantage of comments is that someone browsing the thread sees the comment and provides one.
FemmeThoughts,2if72x,cordis_melum,9,Mon Oct 6 05:01:37 2014 UTC,"I spent some time writing this. You're welcome. :P    Ladies, do you think rape is something men do out of desire for control, empowered by years of patriarchy? You've clearly been mislead by the notion that women are people too. Because let's face it ladies, rape? It's your fault.  It all begins with what you wear. Scientific studies suggest that women who wear skirts are the leading cause of rape. Do you know why? Because men have eyes. In fact, here are some examples of provocative clothing that could cause rape.  [Examples of women dressed in various outfits - a tank top and shorts, a short dress, a sundress, a full niquab, a full-length poncho, and finally a full spacesuit - are shown on screen. Each outfit is accompanied with a EEEH sound and an X - unacceptable.]  Notice the one thing they all have in common? That's right, all women. No woman, no rape!  Now some people might actually argue that the crime is committed by men, and to these people, I say ""who gives birth to these men?"". Right again, it's us!   [Narrator is suddenly assaulted by a masked man. She struggles a bit as she's being dragged off.]  It's my fault.   Indian culture provides for several progressive methods to counter rape. For example, the guard man prescribed [unintelligible - I don't know the language, so I apologize], where you just refer to your attacker as [unintelligible], and vola! Rape cancelled.   [Narrator is suddenly assaulted by a group of men who try to cover her mouth and choke her. She makes muffled screams, and eventually she is let go. She then stands up straight and readjusts her clothes, speaking her next line seemingly breathless and coughing a bit.]  Ladies, this works every time.   [Another narrator. As she says her lines, her veil and jewellery are taken off by an unseen attacker. Finally, as she says her last line, the attacker's hand smears her lipstick.]  Another way women shamelessly propagate rape is by working late into the night. Ladies, why work late and be independent? In fact, why work at all? That's what husbands are for! Fun fact -- if he's your husband, it's ... not rape.  Powerful people have been spreading rumours that things apart from you can cause rape. For example, chowmein. Chowmein is made in the kitchen. And who's in the kitchen? [Narrator nods.] Movies! And who dates the lead man on screen? And cell phones. Cell phones are made for talking, and who talks a lot? In fact, to elucidate further, here is a pie chart.  [Pie chart is shown on screen labelled ""Leading Causes of Sexual Assaults"". The chart says ""90% women"" and ""10% men"".]  As you can see, women are the leading cause of 100% of all sexual assaults. Oh, I'm sorry, the math is wrong. Clearly, this chart was made by a woman.  [The next narrator has some bandages around her head, with a gash on the left side (her right).]  Now, before we go, let's not forget. If you're tired of being humilated by rape, you can always go to the cops and be humiliated by them instead.  Cop: Ma'am, when rape was happen, were you with boys? Woman: No, not ... [shakes head] Cop: Why you went out without boys' protection? Woman: Well, actually, there were a couple of my friends there... Cop: See! You were with boys at night! What will happen? So, what did we learn today? Woman: It's... it's my fault? Thank you, officer. Thank you.    And lastly, ladies, stop seducing juveniles into raping you. They get let off easy, and that just makes you as statutory rapist! And whose fault is that?   It's your fault.  Woman 1: It's my fault. Woman 2: It's my fault. Woman 3: It's my fault. Woman 4: It's my fault. Woman 5: It's my fault. Woman 6: It's my fault. Woman 7: It's my fault. Woman 8: It's my fault. Woman 9: It's my fault.    It's your fault.   [Final few seconds: ""Stop blaming the victim.""]  End video."

FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,dutchesse,13,Sun Oct 5 21:01:37 2014 UTC,"Absolutely correct on all counts. I've certainly been guilty of overestimating the basic human decency American conservatives. But abortion is a social good. We should not weaken our stance, which comes from a place of strength, to appease the unappeasable."
FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,hatespugs,3,Mon Oct 6 00:20:04 2014 UTC,"What the title should say is ""Not having unwanted pregnancies is great.""  Abortion is just a means to an end in this situation, and its hardly the best imaginable means to that end.  Abortion is a social good, but that doesn't stop it from being a necessary evil.  There are a vast number of things that it would be best if society didn't have to do, but that we have to do simply because the alternative is worse.  Forcing women to have children is bad.  The author listed many correct reasons for why forcing women to have children is bad.  I agree with all those reasons, and its why I am pro abortion.  But that doesn't mean that our solution, legal abortions, isn't evil.  Its just less evil than taking control of women's bodies, when the control is rightfully theirs.  In a perfect world, women would only get pregnant when they intended to do so.  Until then, abortion is a necessary evil.  We don't need to sell abortion as a good thing, some sort of social good.  People who are against abortion will likely view that as a disgusting argument.  They view the fetus as a human, and claim to value the sanctity of life (they often seem to be cool with bombing Arabs though), and telling them that it reduces the risk to the mother or helps prevent children being born into families where they are not wanted or cannot be properly supported will not sway their vote.    I've tried on multiple occasions to sway the position of pro-lifers (and other people with other stances i disagree with) and rarely have full out frontal contradictions to their arguments changed their opinions.  If you want to sway public opinion, rather than simply rally your own base like the article that was linked, you need to seem like you agree with the other side, while simply explaining why what they want (and what you pretend to want) is for whatever reason not feasible.  This post is ending up much longer than I had intended, but this is a topic that I am pretty passionate about.  I have had friends who had abortions, and I am glad they had the freedom to do so, and that freedom needs to be preserved for others until we can as a species come up with a better system of birth control than what we have now (male birth control can't come soon enough, condoms feel weird, which might explain all of my daughters.).  But until then, abortions, in all their imperfection, are a necessary evil, and should be viewed as such.  We need to drive innovation and clarity in this market.  We all need to be taught how to practice safe sex, and we need to compel the industry to develop new technologies and practices that advance our cause.   Most things in our existence are necessary evils.  its nothing to be ashamed of, and its nothing that we should have to explain.  people should educate themselves as to why they are necessary before they simply shout them down as evil, as is the case with abortions."
FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,DOTAVICE,9,Mon Oct 6 05:34:40 2014 UTC,"Abortion is just a means to an end in this situation, and its hardly the best imaginable means to that end.   I totally disagree. If I became pregnant, abortion is the best imaginable end to that pregnancy. It isn't an ""evil"" at all. Not even a ""justified evil."" It just plain isn't ""evil"" at all. There's nothing morally wrong with it whatsoever, IMO."
FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,DOTAVICE,1 point,Mon Oct 6 17:16:44 2014 UTC,"I think your understanding of the phrase ""necessary evil"" is a bit limited.  As Wikipedia puts it, ""The lesser of two evils principle (or lesser evil principle) is the principle that when given two bad choices, the one which is not as bad as the other should be chosen over the one that is the greater threat.""    Its often used to describe politicians, democracy, capitalism (although some would say that capitalism is immoral) and many other things in a non moral manner.    Abortions aren't fun.  The abortion pill doesn't feel great, and most people would just prefer to not get pregnant in the first place.  But until we can avoid unwanted pregnancies, we need to have abortions.  But that doesn't make abortions good, it just makes them less bad than unwanted babies.  I'm pretty sure that everyone agrees that abortions have negative traits, and that there is a better alternative (not getting pregnant) but right now, not getting pregnant isn't always a choice.  Birth control fails, people are raped, and other things can lead to unwanted pregnancies.  So until we have a world where unwanted pregnancies don't exist, we are going to need abortions."
FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,ohmyashleyy,5,Mon Oct 6 19:13:41 2014 UTC,"I think you're conflating pleasant with good. Just because something isn't pleasant doesn't mean it isn't good. I mean, unless you view like tooth extractions as ""evil"" the same way you do abortions?"
FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,DOTAVICE,0,Mon Oct 6 19:16:10 2014 UTC,"I tend to think of abortion like I would think of someone choosing to take their loved on off of life support. Neither option is good - you can either let them continue to live like a vegetable or you can make a choice to pull the plug, but then you bear the weight of having made the decision to end a life.  With an unwanted pregnancy, you can choose to carry the pregnancy to term, which isn't a good idea a lot of the time, or you can choose to end a (potential) life. In that case, abortion is the lesser of two evils, so to speak. Like DOTAVICE said, it's an expression. It's not the same as saying abortion is morally wrong.  Just because some of us think that abortion is necessary evil doesn't mean we're any less pro-choice, and it doesn't mean that we judge women who decide to get one. Abortion is ""good"" in the sense that it allows women to not be forced into carrying an unwanted pregnancy, but it's not ideal by any means.  But you're definitely not going to sway anyone over to your side by calling abortion ""great."""
FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,hermithome,-1,Mon Oct 6 20:06:32 2014 UTC,"I'm not conflating anything, I know that what is pleasant isn't always moral.  Its just that the expression ""necessary evil"" isn't as limited as you think it is.  The word ""evil"" in the expression ""necessary evil"" doesn't always have moral implications.  There are two types of bad.  Bad moral, and bad like unpleasant.  The expression ""necessary evil"" is often used to describe the latter style of bad.  I don't view abortions as immoral.  I view them as worse than not getting pregnant.   I view tooth extractions as not as good as not having tooth extractions.  But they are a ""necessary evil"" of having healthy teeth if your wisdom teeth come in at a bad angle.    You are getting hung up on the word ""evil.""  In this common expression, it doesn't mean what it says in the dictionary, or at least it has a broader meaning.  Lawyers are often described as a ""necessary evil.""  It would be best if we didn't fight, and didn't need a legal system.  But we need a legal system, and people who are trained to operate within that legal system.  That expression isn't claiming that lawyers are evil, its simply acknowledging that we would be better off if they were not needed.  Its an expression, it can't be taken literally in all circumstances, like most other expressions."
FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,so_srs,3,Mon Oct 6 19:21:40 2014 UTC,"Sure, but then again, lawyers are actually evil :P  Joke aside, using the term ""necessary evil"" in a context where people actually believe that X is evil .... tends to be confusing rhetorically.  Edit: see further down on this thread where people are using ""necessary evil"" in a different manner"

FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,hermithome,1 point,Mon Oct 6 18:23:28 2014 UTC,I am going to point out that this subreddit isn't designed to official accessibility standards to begin with. There is a legal set of standards that the government (edit: US government) follows and some of them you have control over. The biggest one I see is color. The color selections of this subreddit are not all in compliance with what is legally acceptable to accessibility. There are more than just screen readers out there which r/Accessible seems to ignore.  I will also point out that I find the AutoModerator's frequency of posting annoying. Asking for video transcripts is one thing. Mandating it for video and images is another especially reaction gif's. It has held me back from posting content on multiple occasions.
FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,unplural,1 point,Mon Oct 6 20:15:20 2014 UTC,"You're only half right about the colours. I actually tested the subreddit colours, and because we can define things properly, any browser mods that are used will work.  To be colour compliant you need to have properly defined colours so that any of the standard CB mods, and all custom swaps will work, which we have. There is a bit of an issue with parts of the sidebar not adjusting properly, which we're aware of and working on. We're also working to make the subreddit night mode friendly.   Yes, you're right, this is reddit and people will post memes and reaction gifs frequently. And that can be really alienating for people who can't read those. It would be one thing if it was a final comment, but coversations often incorporate these, which make it hard for people to follow the conversation period.  We can adjust the automod to send PMs as well, and we'll discuss doing that. And overall, if we notice that the majority of our users are regularly providing transcripts, we'll discontinue the comments altogether."
FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,phinnaeusmaximus,1 point,Mon Oct 6 23:34:33 2014 UTC,"I am not sure what these ""CB"" mods are that you're talking about. I've tested your color contrast ratio. I have designed websites/apps that must meet government compliance standards to prevent people from being sued, and it didn't pass. For example, yellow text is always a bad idea. It is almost never the proper contrast to pass AA compliance testing."
FemmeThoughts,2idxx5,ohmyashleyy,1 point,Mon Oct 6 23:38:42 2014 UTC,"See this accessibility checker: http://colorfilter.wickline.org/  Most users who have colour blind issues either download add-ons that automatically adjust certain colours, or they have their settigs set to manually swap certain things.  For example I do actually find the subreddit a bit difficult to read. So I mostly browse in nightmode, or I simply disable the subreddit CSS.

FemmeThoughts,2ibq5d,softinseattle,6,Sun Oct 5 05:57:34 2014 UTC,"i was a field ecologist in grad school. my first advisor was abusive, although not necessarily a sexual harasser. he was racist, ""why is it that every chinese scientist is molecular?"" and transphobic, ""the first time i saw 'joan' roughgarden i said to myself, my god! what a hideous woman!"" and sexist, he just loved to tell us that his favorite saturday night live sketch was the ""jane, you ignorant slut"" incident.   i ended up leaving his lab after a paper-writing scandal where he'd agreed to let me be first author on a paper, then later turned around and accused me of stealing the data in order to scoop him! it was crazypants. we went to official departmental arbitration, he agreed to give me additional data for a co-authored paper. then he wouldn't give me the data, asked an undergraduate to author instead of me and told her not to tell me about it! the paper ended up being submitted without me on it, so i quit. of course, there were absolutely no consequences for going back on our officially arbitrated agreement.   i firmly believe that sexual harassment, discrimination and assault need to be understood within the culture of tolerance of abuse that is part of academia. grad students of all genders, races etc will be abused because there is a ridiculous power dynamic between professors and students, post-docs, techs etc. not surprising that abusers and sociopaths would attack people with demographic-specific types of abuse. here are just a few scandals that happened to other people i know from grad school:    a woman in my program found sexually explicit books left on the desk in her office. she suspects her advisor left them. he sabotaged her research and tried to tank her dissertation defense just a few days beforehand.  a man in my program had been doing well, getting grants and publications etc. when he came back in the room after his general exam, none of his committee members would meet his eyes. he had been given a ""fail with no chance to retake"" which is, just, never supposed to be given except under extreme circumstances. but for some reason his advisor threw him under a bus. he was in the country on a specific visa related to being in grad school and would have to leave if they kicked him out of the program. the department ended up letting him retake (showing how wrong it was!), which he passed, because he hadn't failed to begin with.  a professor started having an extramarital affair with an undergraduate lab tech. she applied to grad school in our department, and was largely accepted on his recommendation. she joined another lab, he divorced his wife, and they got married. no one cared. this is more of a case of two ambitious sociopaths finding each other rather than exploitation, but the fact that the department ignores shenanigans between undergrads and professors is disturbing.  a woman i know was a research assistant in a lab and spent 2 years on a project, writing a paper with another research assistant who was a man. when the paper was eventually published, they barely made it into the acknowledgements, despite having written the bulk of the paper and edits."
FemmeThoughts,2ibq5d,swishingwell,3,Sun Oct 5 07:24:06 2014 UTC,"I have collected a lot of minor things, but no big stories. Some examples are comments on my (totally normal) outfits, assuming my lab partner was my boyfriend, and my old adviser telling my new adviser that I was ""sensitive"" because I got emotional about repeatedly failing quals and being unhappy/unsupported in my old lab.   Haha oh yeah this made me remember how bad my old lab was:   All the male grad students refused to clean and tried to make the women do all the cleaning. The lab was GROSS, there was dust everywhere, spills that didn't get wiped up, MOLD GROWING IN THE SINK. Men dominated group meetings, and even explicitly ignored the 2-3 women sometimes (by holding up the just a sec finger and then never getting back to her). Sometimes we would make suggestions that would be shot down, then the male colleague would repeat them and others would agree. One of the guys was hogging the microscope and he signed up from 8-6 every day one week. Another woman in the lab needed the microscope for 30 minutes that week, so she penciled herself in on top of the hog during his normal lunch hour. She was later yelled at by this guy for not respecting his work! In my individual meetings, I would bring results that I thought were interesting because they didn't turn out as I expected. Before I even opened my mouth they said it didn't matter because I wasn't supposed to run that test. (I was inexperienced, and it was not novel to them, but I could have learned more by talking about it and interacting) When I asked for help, my (male) lab-mates just did it for me instead of teaching me how to do it."

FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,expanj,35,Sat Oct 4 13:31:35 2014 UTC,"2X has just become another reddit men's club. A lot of threads there have just become an echo chamber of reddit guys thinking they know more about being a woman than women do. ""Why's it such a big deal? Geez just get over it, you don't really get harrassed that much, I bet you just love the attention and your fucking with us. How could you possibly know your own thoughts if you have a vagina? Bitches are crazy, everyone knows that"". As if those kinda redditors needed another platform for their thoughts..."
FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,rachawakka,28,Sat Oct 4 17:53:06 2014 UTC,"Ohhh, but can't you see how much more enlightened and informed those misogynist shitbuckets are now?  That was why the mods threw 2X to the lions, after all; to educate the general Reddit population.  Never mind that 2X was one of of only a few truly women-positive spaces on Reddit, they felt it was justified to destroy that safe space in order to help the assholes learn.  It's like busting into a support group and saying ""we know you all want a place where you're safe to talk about the problems and experiences you have, but we felt that educating the assholes who victimized you in the first place is more important than that so we've invited them to sit in on all of your sessions from now on.""  Fuck 2X."
FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,7,Sat Oct 4 20:28:20 2014 UTC,"I never thought of it that way, but that's totally how it is. Abusers sitting in on the support session."
FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,LadyCailin,8,Sun Oct 5 03:30:40 2014 UTC,"At least then that's transparent. I think it's far more irritating when they upvote content by women they agree with or whose opinion they like. ""Thank you for saying that"" no shut up, shut up forever. The worst part about that is that it makes everybody else in the community hostile to those opinions cos it means their own will be drowned out."
FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,nightride,3,Sat Oct 4 20:03:31 2014 UTC,"I have also seen so many people (men) on 2X lately, who have been actually victimizing themselves. Coming back to the age old story, that feminists are evil, and are undermining men (oppressing). In OP's original thread on 2X, a user said    It's like a lot of jokes about men. ""Show up naked, bring beer."" comes to mind. It's at the expense of men. OP just seems to want to vent.    All in one comment, suddenly men are victims and women ""just want to vent"" (totally ""over-emotional, and shouldn't tkae out her PSM on redditors"").  Just to be clear, not saying that sexism doesn't exit against men, of course it does. But the thread was about a specific topic, about a specific joke that actually offends many women. And the new population of 2X, managed to do just what she was complaining about. Telling her she's over-emotional, overly sensitive and in general just dismissing her opinion. Urgh"
FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,sandrasymbiont,5,Sun Oct 5 08:23:21 2014 UTC,"And as if it invidates the offensiveness and stupidity of period jokes because men get joked about too. No, that just means they're both wrong, you complete assholes, it's just that men can get over it pretty easily because jokes about men don't question their rationality. The stubborn ignorance is what gets me."
FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,rachawakka,3,Sun Oct 5 17:36:59 2014 UTC,"I liked that 2X was big and well known enough that just about any woman redditor could find it, but not default so that people didn't join it unintentionally.  I'm pretty sure that almost all of the men who got defaulted in wouldn't have joined it if they had to hit 'subscribe' of their own free will, and that if 2x did something like ""unsubscribes everyone, leaves the default"" it would recover at least some of its actual utility."

FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,devilstouch,41,Sun Oct 5 03:42:07 2014 UTC,"I think it's because people like to minimise others' emotions to prevent taking responsibility for their own actions: ""you wouldn't be so mad if you weren't on your period!""  It's an easy way to undermine someone's argument as well, there is no response that doesn't justify (to the one using the period argument) it, except having to break the argument into two; the original argument and now defending yourself and your emotional state.   My ex would do something similar; we would argue and he would pick a point he knew I would agree with him on and when I'd agreed on this tangential point, the argument was over and he had won. Nothing about the original argument had been resolved. It's a distraction to avoid solving an argument.   In everyday stuff; people are idiots."

Since women and men are apparently monolith (/s) and the easiest/loudest people win for shaping the opinions of other assholes, that really isn't helping."
FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,hatespugs,17,Sat Oct 4 16:59:32 2014 UTC,"I've observed many women actually using ""I'm on my period"" as a justification for expressing themselves and having feelings. I've also seen women frequently asking for validation of their feelings (i.e. ""am I crazy?"" am I overreacting?"" ""should I feel this way or are my feelings wrong?""). This is internalized sexism. Feelings aren't wrong and women using periods as a justification for having them and for acting a certain way is a coping symptom of the larger societal problem: women's thoughts, feelings, opinions... are dismissed simply because they're women. We are taught that in order to remain polite we must often qualify, backtrack, and ask permission to express ourselves in case that expression is bothersome to someone else.   TL;DR: DAE hate it when women express themselves and then backtrack by asking if their perspective is wrong?"
FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,dragnflye,7,Sat Oct 4 20:26:52 2014 UTC,"Yes!  It's infuriating!  And there's a ton of women in 2X who phrase ""I need help with my relationship problems"" as ""Am I being irrational/Not the perfect girlfriend"" as if there's some sort of platonic ideal of 'girlfriend' that must be strove for, instead of living in a relationship that makes them happy.  It's always in the context of ""something makes me unhappy, it must be my FAULT"" as opposed to sometimes bad things happen to people or a relationship between two otherwise good people is bad for one or both of them or any of a million other possibilities.  No, whenever something goes wrong, it has to be the woman's fault."

Well you're somewhere on that hormonal cycle so nothing you say is real!""  It's a culturally ingrained sexism that belittles women, denies us our thoughts, and is used as evidence to incompetency. Those jokes are linked to the notion that women are emotional, irrational, and untrustworthy with power or responsibility. They're downright sexist and anyone proclaiming to be a feminist needs to knock that shit off and more importantly understand why those jokes aren't innocuous."
FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,12,Sat Oct 4 14:53:46 2014 UTC,"Because even in this crapsack misogynist world people aren't generally allowed to say ""I hate women and judge them to be inferior to men"" in mixed company, but saying that exact same thing by undercutting women's agency, intelligence, and value with a ""joke"" is just fine."

The ""joke"" you posted doesn't bother me (although I don't think it's particularly funny either). It just seems to be describing what happens and not necessarily commenting on it. I have said similar things to my SO in a joking manner.   There are some comments I just can't stand though, for example, flat out dismissing every emotional reaction. Even if I AM on my period, I don't just do things for absolutely no reason. I mean, it may be a very minor thing that triggers it, but it's always something that bothers me to some extent on a normal day that I usually just brush off.   However, the one thing that ALWAYS bugs me about these sorts of things is that all women always get lumped together. Some people are like me, some are worse, some are better, and some don't notice any emotional changes at all. I don't mind it much because it's often fairly accurate for me so I can laugh about it, but I can imagine how frustrating it would be to be somebody who doesn't experience it at all and still constantly get those kinds of comments."

FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,sandrasymbiont,9,Sun Oct 5 03:03:57 2014 UTC,"It pisses me off on multiple levels.    First, it implies that a woman's psychology is purely a result of her biology, while a man's is not, and that since a woman's thoughts and feelings are due to biology (where as a man's are ???) they can just be discounted.  It's insane in so many ways.    Second, it puts women in this awful state of having to deny that they have any reaction to their period at all.  I think people in pain tend to be cranky, that's pretty fucking fair!  If a man has chronic back pain, we still listen to his opinion, and we sympathize that if he has a shorter temper, but when it's a woman nooope.  Third, it's terrible as a joke.  It's boring.  Boring is the worst thing a joke can possibly be.  Even if it wasn't annoying and offensive, it's been beaten to death and it's never used with any sort of actual 'punch' to the punchline.  It just sits there, being boring and stupid and misogynistic.   The only reason anybody uses it is to reinforce patriarchal control of women."
FemmeThoughts,2i9w5l,thesilvertongue,3,Sat Oct 4 21:46:35 2014 UTC,"My period emotions make me incredibly irrational. I cry over the smallest things and get angry and it really is awful.

During that time I often catch myself in tip-toeing around, and ignoring my own feeling, i.e. ""acting"" happy and calm all the time. During that period of every month, I feel like I'm not allowed to be a real person with real emotion, because then I'd just be the butt of a joke, and get called out for being a bitch on her period.

Abortion is a legal right and if there's no ""parental consent"" possible (because there's no parent) then the judicial bypass should be automatic.

Don't subscribe to this view.  I'm not saying there isn't always time to be polite (because there is), but do not put being polite above your own needs (physical or mental).

Liberal feminists argue that society holds the false belief that women are, by nature, less intellectually and physically capable than men; thus it tends to discriminate against women in the academy, the forum, and the marketplace. Liberal feminists believe that ""female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women’s entrance to and success in the so-called public world"", and they work hard to emphasize the equality of men and women through political and legal reform.

I'm aware that ""liberal"" doesn't necessarily pertain to a particular political party, but I've never seen the label ascribed to the characteristics this author is claiming. I concur about your statement about the liberal/libertarianism though.  What's the term for ""I still like men, but I want things to be more equal"" feminism?"
FemmeThoughts,2i0a3f,Elendira,5,Wed Oct 1 19:53:01 2014 UTC,"What's the term for ""I still like men, but I want things to be more equal"" feminism?   ...a feminist?  :)  As for the rest, you seem quite hung up on the term ""liberal feminism"", but remember that it is a somewhat arbitrary name for a specific branch of feminism.  You can't take the name literally.  (That being said, I found the linked article a bit disappointing.  Plenty of sound and fury, but little substance.  For example, claiming that ""the liberal feminist movement argues sexist objectification and violent pornography can be feminist"" is a bold move; then linking to an article that says no such thing is a bit of a let down.  There's a big difference between stating that you can be a feminist and a sex worker—or feminist and kinky—and stating that sex work or kink is inherently feminist.  It's a difference that can be ignored for the sake of a good rant, but the result is just a rant.)"
FemmeThoughts,2i0a3f,codayus,1 point,Thu Oct 2 14:16:47 2014 UTC,"Not hung up, per se, just trying to be clear. I found it to be very strange that the article stressed it so much is all. I don't tend to categorize it."

Not just in case he gets weird, but just to support you and make you feel less isolated. The beauty of most tapbletop rpg clubs is that, unless he's in your campaign, you can probably easily get away with not being around him. How big is the club?"
FemmeThoughts,2hvypn,sophievibes,5,Tue Sep 30 19:09:03 2014 UTC,"Seconding this, having a friend or some support will help distract you from him (hopefully) and keep you grounded. You deserve to show your face in front people who have the great opportunity of getting to know you. This is about you, and not about him anymore. Avoid him at the club, just make new friends. The gaming club I recently joined on my campus was very welcoming, and I was so thankful for it.  Good luck and have fun! If you go once and don't like it, at least you can know some people (who were friendly to you) to meet up and play outside of the club."

Personally, I started a local women only gaming club. First reason being it is hard to find other women interested in the same hobby because the hobby is so male dominated. Second reason was all the reports of 'the creep' ever girl is trying to avoid. That one guy or maybe more than one guys who made women feel uncomfortable at events. The guys who use events to hit on women awkwardly or belittle women into feeling like they don't belong."

FemmeThoughts,2hv5gf,pennyloop,17,Tue Sep 30 05:34:23 2014 UTC,"For me the most important thing was to not let my imagination get ahead of reality. Crushes are fine things, but acknowledge them as crushes - a crush on a guy you know is about as based in reality as a crush on George Clooney.  I highly recommend http://captainawkward.com/ . She covers an awful lot of (often niche) situations, but if you hunt around in the archives you can find advice aimed at you.  Captain Awkward would say ""mutual initial attraction, then friendship, and then more"" is fine if it's working for you, but if it's not, there's nothing wrong with a more direct approach. ""Friends first"" being better is a cultural myth. There's absolutely nothing wrong with starting right at dates with more-or-less-strangers through OKCupid or whatever, though it is a lot of work.  ""Wouldn't even consider me"" is a red flag too. Have you asked them? If not, you have no idea. [I would personally be leery of dating older guys at 19 though (if older is >college) just because a lot of older guys interested in 19 year olds are going to turn out to have serious issues. Sucks, but a fact of US culture at the very least.]  It's great that you're out meeting people though. Meeting someone is mostly luck, and the only way to affect luck is to give yourself more chances. And forget anyone who discounts you for being ""a bit of a tomboy"", anyone that hung up on traditional presentation is a jerk.  tl;dr: Internet date. Be more direct and proactive."
FemmeThoughts,2hv5gf,so_srs,4,Tue Sep 30 05:51:06 2014 UTC,"Thank you! Perhaps I should reconsider my approach.   On a related topic, I'm trying to get more comfortable with flirting. I was raised to think that flirting is bad, that it's something only loose women do. But I'm starting to realise that not true. It's a lot of fun, as long as both parties are alright with it and you're not leading each other on. There's a thrill to be bad when you meet someone who matches you in conversation and jokes, and it's very exciting to be discovering it.   So I'm definitely going to try and be look direct.

Friends first, then relationship are the types of relationships that are happy accidents that are a result of months or even years of build ups. You can't go searching for that. It presents itself to you.   Food for thought, my best and current relationship we had sex the very first night. We had that initial attraction big time right when we saw each other. We both knew it was on and rolled with it. Not saying you should do exactly that, but consider relationships that don't build in your current ideal mold."

FemmeThoughts,2hv5gf,Super_Frez,3,Tue Sep 30 16:32:25 2014 UTC,"I never dated til I was 19, for pretty much the same reasons as you (but also crippling social anxiety; I had pretty much decided it wasn't worth it to even try dating, no matter what possibilities there were). One thing to think about is that a lot of the people you know are not going to stay in their relationships for years. Never ever hover around a certain person expecting them to break up so you can swoop in when they are single, but you can expect that many of the people you know will be available at some point during their relationships. Your opportunities and the ways you relate to the people you already know will shift constantly, and opportunities will crop up in surprising ways. Keep being sociable, that's the best thing to do. You will keep meeting new people that way, through ever-expanding circles of acquaintances, and eventually you'll meet someone who is both available and attractive to you. Just be open to the possibilities that will be constantly changing! There's no way you will not meet anyone at all. That's just impossible. Also, join a club or start a hobby that other people your age do. That will help you build your social life."

I met tons of great people while I was in school but it was the same thing as you, either they weren't interested or were already dating someone.  It was definitely frustrating and kind of lonely, but in hindsight it was really good for me.  I figured out who I was, what I like, what I want in life, and what I would want from a relationship.  I think it paid off as well, I met a really great guy while I was in school and after college when I moved to his area (not for him, for other reasons) we were able to start a solid, monogamous relationship. We've been together, and I have friends who are still going out on dates, hooking up with random people, etc, and I don't feel like I missing out.  I had my crazy single years, and now I'm ready to settle down."

FemmeThoughts,2hpim6,teapot_doc,16,Sun Sep 28 16:50:03 2014 UTC,"I think there's definitely a problem here in how we introduce the topic of sex to our children. I have a young boy and he was very interested in how the baby (his baby sister) in his mama's tummy got there, so we bought a book and read it to him. Most books aimed at children about where babies come from really focus on the idea that sex is something that happens a) between a man and a woman, b) who are in love, and c) trying to make a baby. That's all fine and well, but it's a bit of a lie - after all, I imagine that for most of us, the overwhelming majority of the sex we have is not for reproductive purposes, and love is certainly not necessary for good sex! Now, I appreciate that we are dealing with children, and so an in-depth account of sex isn't necessary, but at the same time these are the foundations we lay - when we teach children about sex, we are initially teaching them that it is about reproduction, and that is going to set the stage for later sex education, especially for girls; i.e., sex gets you pregnant, here's how to avoid getting pregnant, instead of, here's how to have safe sex that's also fun and fulfilling for you. So the route we're taking with our children is just to give them a bit more info - we just tell them that sex is something that you do when you're older, and it is usually for fun and enjoyment, or as a way to show that you care for or love your partner, and if you want to make a baby then you can have sex as a way of making a baby. I think that then gives us a solid foundation to work from, so that when they grow up we can talk to them frankly and honestly about it, including the very important fact that most sex they will have will probably be for pleasure."
FemmeThoughts,2hpim6,Fairleee,1 point,Sun Sep 28 22:42:30 2014 UTC,"Such an interesting point that is spot on. I never realized how the idea of ""man and woman, sex for love to make a baby"" gets planted so early."

She has more songs about independence than I can think of for most female singers: Independent women; Me,Myself,and I; Survivor; So Good; Girls Run the World; Bills,bills,bills; and more. Did you see her Superbowl performance 2 years ago (I think it was 2 years ago)? Everyone on stage was a woman from the background singers, to the band, to the dancers. When she was promoting her mom's clothing brand, they brought up 2 models at the same time, one model was a size 2/4 and another model wearing the same dress in size 12/14.   These are just a few examples off the top of my head. You have to look closely at what she does rather than what she says or what others say about her."

Racism against white people doesn't have the same context as racism against POC because of context - white people are not particularly suffering or losing out on opportunities because of everyday racism.  Now, not saying here that it's okay to make ""white girl"" jokes.  It's rude and people who mock other people are being assholes.  But it's not racism per se, it's just being an asshole.

FemmeThoughts,2hfxr6,kindlefirefox,12,Thu Sep 25 16:59:33 2014 UTC,"Do research on these stereotypes. Fried chicken and watermelon are not random or new stereotypes at all. They've been used for a hundred years to antagonize minorities.  They are very old and deeply rooted in blackface and other historical racist other oppressive portrayals of black people.  For example, there is a song ""N****** loves watermelon Ha Ha Ha"". That portrays black people in an extremely offensive animal like fashion. I wish I could link it but I'm on mobile. I'm sure you could find it if you just Google it. This is a good historical context to show people who think the watermelon stereotype is random harmless fun.   As for fried chicken, many think the stereotype originates from a 1915 silent film ""Birth of a Nation"" where a black man was portrayed animalistically devouring fried chicken in a town hall.  Most of these stereotypes involved blackface and portraying black people as subhuman or animal like.  Unlike Starbucks, these stereotypes are older, deeper, and have much more problematic roots. They were one weapon in the larger systematic societal subjugation of black people."

Technically, yeah, any joke about any race is racist, but there's a good reason nobody gives a shit if someone says a white guy can't jump. It's because those jokes don't reinforce an existing negative bias our society has against that group. So while they're definitely stupid, unoriginal, and probably say a lot about the speaker, they aren't harmful in the same way jokes against more marginalized groups are.   Jokes about white girls and starbucks are a problem because they're sexist, not really because they're racist. Race is obviously an element, but I don't see it as the harmful one. Jokes like that reinforce the idea of women as not being serious/only interested in frivolous things. And it's probably also worth considering why those jokes are only aimed at white girls. The idea of ""basic"" girls is that they have no distinguishing features--so then is just being black seen as abnormal enough to avoid that label?  So stepping back from my tangent there, the reason jokes about minorities are so wrong is because they're rooted in and reinforce centuries of social bias against a group. There was actually a study done somewhat recently that found that people who listened to sexist jokes were more likely to hold/be accepting of a sexist worldview. It's probably a fair assumption that this effect holds true for other forms of bias as well--so it's not just SJW bullshit to think these jokes are harmful."

If a joke pokes fun at a demographic that can't change  (race, gender, age) then it's bigoted.

No, that's just fundamentally incorrect. Jokes about black people being lazy or violent hurt more than just someone's feelings. They perpetuate terrible stereotypes that hurt black people, and help feed an oppressive system.  Whereas, jokes about white people not being able to dance don't feed any oppression. In fact, in a white people can't dance joke, it's still black culture that is being stereotyped.  There are lots of jokes that involve race and ethnicity that are unfunny and hurtful that aren't racist.  Now, specific to the jokes you mentioned, those absolutely fall into the category of bigoted. And they absolutely are kicking down rather than kicking up. The joke is making fun of people who were oppressed because they were oppressed. It's gross and disgusting and bigoted.  But, it's still vastly different from most black jokes, because depending on where you're located, the joke isn't really feeding into an oppressive system and helping continue it. So it's a horribly gross joke, but it is not as harmful as certain jokes."

The answer is: No one cares because yes they are both technically racist, it's way more offensive to call a black person the N word, because there is a history of systematic racism embedded in that word that makes it very powerful since you are using it from a place of privilege.   I don't really think you can compare the two because they are not equivalent!"

If the ideal is the goal, then we should strive towards the ideal, and treat each case as what it is by itself.   No, jokes about white people are not the same as jokes about black people. And yes, it's terribly important to recognise these differences. We do not allow colour blind attitudes or false equivalences here.   Jokes about black people do more than just hurt someone's feelings. They perpetuate terrible stereotypes that hurt black people, and help feed an oppressive system.  Jokes about black people being lazy and violent help feed those stereotypes. In America, a white man with a felony record is more likely to get a job than an equally qualified black man without a record. And there's a significant white / black wage gap. Some of that is caused by very blatant racism, but a lot of it is caused simply by discriminatory attitudes that a lot of non-black people aren't even aware of.  DO NOT continue with false equivalence and colour blind narratives in this subreddit."

They're getting to know people and networking which is key to any field.   You could always ask them how they did it. People are flattered usually when you take an interest in them and compliment them on how well they did in life. Your admiration seems sincere. It doesn't hurt to offer to buy them a coffee if they're willing to sit down with you and talk it over. You can even do it over email if they're a really busy person. Not everyone will agree but someone will and they'll be able to direct you.

I would message complete strangers and get a 30% response rate, which I don't think is bad consider I didn't even know these people and had no connection like being alumni of the school I was going to.

Rapists lives are hardly ever ruined and it's even less so for innocent people accused of rape.  Rape accusations have a tragic way in resulting in absolutely nothing.  Besides, I'm fine with the libel, slander, and perjury laws as is.  False accusations are already 100% illegal,  making it tougher and scarier to bring a case to trail will not bring justice."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,Tangurena,49,Thu Sep 25 01:36:01 2014 UTC,"I think what is part of the problem is that many repeat rapists are good at framing their actions as ""not rape"". Some of this is reposted from other comments I've posted before.    As long as the R word doesn’t get attached, rapists do self-report. The guy who says he sees a woman too drunk to know where she is as an opportunity is not joking. He’s telling you how he sees it. The guy who says, “bros before hos”, is asking you to make a pact.  The Pact. The social structure that allows the predators to hide in plain sight, to sit at the bar at the same table with everyone, take a target home, rape her, and stay in the same social circle because she can’t or won’t tell anyone, or because nobody does anything if she does. The pact to make excuses, to look for mitigation, to patch things over — to believe that what happens to our friends — what our friends do to our friends — is not (using Whoopi Goldberg’s pathetic apologetics) “rape-rape”.     http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/meet-the-predators/     I think the biggest takeaway from that passage is that as long as the R-word isn't spoken out loud, then that guy will admit what he's doing.   And ""rape culture"" requires the intentional ignorance and avoidance of the issue of rape. Or by carefully pretending (and redefining it) that it is only done by strangers who jump out of bushes, or out of dark alleys. Thus Whoopi Goldberg's denial that what Roman Polanski did was ""rape"" at all. Or that when it is done by drunken people, it isn't rape, because the guy didn't jump out of an alley. It involves the deliberate denial that drunk people are incapable of giving consent, or that statutory rape exists because people below a certain age cannot lawfully give consent (nor enter into contracts).   The whole ""bros before hoes"" mentality is the pact that keeps this going.    It is the modus operandi that keeps the undetected rapist undetected: they correctly identify a methodology that will put them under the protection of the rape culture. They are unlikely to be convicted because the story doesn’t fit the script. In fact, they are unlikely to be arrested because the story doesn’t lead to easy convictions. In fact, they are unlikely to be reported because rape survivors know that the tactics these men use leave them with little real recourse. In fact, these rapists may put the victim in a position where she is so intoxicated or terrified or just isolated and defeated that she never even says “no,” and because the culture overwhelmingly refuses to call these tactics what they are, even the victims themselves may be unable to call it rape for a very long time afterward, if ever.      http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/24/predator-redux/      If you read this blog, I’m going to tell you something you already know:  rapes don’t happen by accident.  We know that the vast majority of rapes are committed by the same relatively narrow sliver of the population, that they have multiple victims, that they avoid overt force, which is more likely to get them prosecuted, that they choose victims who can be bullied and isolated and that alcohol is their tool of choice.   One might read this and conclude that it doesn’t matter how women communicate boundaries, because rapists don’t misunderstand, they choose to ignore.     http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/mythcommunication-its-not-that-they-dont-understand-they-just-dont-like-the-answer/     The thing is, rapists absolutely need one thing to operate.  They need people to believe they are not rapists.  Stranger rapists do that by trying to hide that they are the person who committed the rape.  Acquaintance rapists do that by picking targets who won’t say anything about what happened, or by using tactics that, if the survivor does speak up, people will decide don’t really count as rape.  If you want to do something about rapists, make sure people know they are rapists.      http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/20/cockblocking-rapists-is-a-moral-obligation-or-how-to-stop-rape-right-now/    If he is part of your social circle, then tell the women in your social circle. If your friends invite him over, leave. Tell them why.   If women are raised being told by parents, teachers, media, peers, and all surrounding social strata that:     it is not okay to set solid and distinct boundaries and reinforce them immediately and dramatically when crossed (“mean bitch”) it is not okay to appear distraught or emotional (“crazy bitch”) it is not okay to make personal decisions that the adults or other peers in your life do not agree with, and it is not okay to refuse to explain those decisions to others (“stuck-up bitch”) it is not okay to refuse to agree with somebody, over and over and over again (“angry bitch”) it is not okay to have (or express) conflicted, fluid, or experimental feelings about yourself, your body, your sexuality, your desires, and your needs (“bitch got daddy issues”) it is not okay to use your physical strength (if you have it) to set physical boundaries (“dyke bitch”) it is not okay to raise your voice (“shrill bitch”) it is not okay to completely and utterly shut down somebody who obviously likes you (“mean dyke/frigid bitch”)     If we teach women that there are only certain ways they may acceptably behave, we should not be surprised when they behave in those ways.      http://fugitivus.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/another-post-about-rape-3/       When I posted about a rapist in a community I belonged to, although I gave almost no details about the guy except ""he's a rapist,"" I immediately got several emails from other members of that community saying ""oh, you must mean X.""  Everyone knew who he was!  Tons of people, including several in the leadership, instantly knew who I meant.  The reaction wasn't ""there's a rapist among us!?!"" but ""oh hey, I bet you're talking about our local rapist.""  Several of them expressed regret that I hadn't been warned about him beforehand, because they tried to discreetly tell new people about this guy.  Others talked about how they tried to make sure there was someone keeping an eye on him at parties, because he was fine so long as someone remembered to assign him a Rape Babysitter.    People had gotten so used to working around this guy, to accommodating his ""special requirements,"" that they didn't feel like there was an urgent problem in their community.  They did eventually expel him, but it was after months of it being widely shared knowledge that he was a rapist and had done other unethical sexual things as well.     I think there were some people in the community who were intentionally protecting him, but there were more who were de facto protecting him by treating him like a missing stair.  Like something you're so used to working around, you never stop to ask ""what if we actually fixed this?""  Eventually you take it for granted that working around this guy is just a fact of life, and if he hurts someone, that's the fault of whoever didn't apply the workarounds correctly.       http://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2012/06/missing-stair.html    I'm going to recommend these blog posts which have a lot of useful links (some above): http://captainawkward.com/2013/10/28/predator-prevention-links/    http://captainawkward.com/2011/03/24/the-art-of-no-continued-saying-no-when-youve-already-said-yes/   I think there is more at the blog Yes Means Yes that you can spend a bunch of time reading."

What about rape? It involves the physical assault, and destroying another person's mental health. It often completely ruins their ability to cope with life, their ability to have healthy relationships or be okay with their own body. Rape is destructive and it's a complete disregard for another human's bodily autonomy and is one of the most gut-wrenching and horrifying crimes that I can think of. It's literally taking a person's body and saying that they do not have as much ownership as the assailant does. It's disgusting.  But you know what's even worse than that in reddit's eyes? False rape accusations! I mean, yes, I feel bad for the handful of men that get accused and have their lives ruined.

FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,killertofuuuuu,5,Thu Sep 25 03:36:49 2014 UTC,"furthermore, I was under the impression that false rape accusation is not a rampant problem like reddit thinks it is.  Aren't percentages of false rape accusation about the same as false accusations of other crimes?"
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,NowThatsAwkward,2,Thu Sep 25 17:12:32 2014 UTC,"They like to proclaiming that every rape case that doesn't end in a prosecution is actually a false rape accusation. That boosts their numbers nicely. If only they cared about innocence until being proven guilty when it came to the crime of false accusations!  The amount of convictions of false rape accusations and wasting police time on them are pretty low, though I'm not sure what it is for other serious crimes."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,so_srs,39,Thu Sep 25 22:35:38 2014 UTC,"This is really upsetting to me, and to be honest, I'm not really sure why. Anyone want to talk through this?   Going by the very incomplete FBI data, at best 40% of rapes get reported to police. Maybe 8% get prosecuted. 4% get a felony conviction.  The rate of incidence of false reports of rape is the same as false reports of any major crime, in the 3%-7% range. False reports of rape as with all false reports do have harsh consequences for the person that lied to police, and have a very high rate of prosecution and conviction - at least an order of magnitude more than (true) reports of rape.  You have to have an incredibly twisted worldview to be more worried about false reports of rape than, y'know, actual rape.  https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates"
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,SharkWoman,4,Wed Sep 24 23:23:31 2014 UTC,"Do you have a source for the false rape conviction rate? Because it really makes no sense. Why would fake reports be more likely to result in a conviction than legitimate ones, considering the point is you wouldn't be able to tell the two apart?"
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,so_srs,10,Wed Sep 24 23:28:47 2014 UTC,"Sorry if it was unclear, but I'm talking about false reports being prosecuted, not rape - a woman reports a man raped her, it's investigated and found that the woman lied, and the woman is prosecuted for a false report."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,hermithome,9,Wed Sep 24 23:36:21 2014 UTC,"Also, it should be said that these statistics are murky at best, because a lot of things get classified improperly.  Until recently in at least one precinct it was the policy of the department to assume all victims were lying at threaten to prosecute them. A lot of time complaints that the police don't believe, complaints that get dropped, that the prosecutor refuses to prosecute or that lose in court get categorised as ""false complaints""  So it's really, really, really hard to find good numbers on this stuff.  We do know a few things though. A large portion of false complaints are from someone too afraid to identify the actual complaintant (this is especially true in cases of child abuse, and cases where the rapists threatened further violence to the victim or someone the victim loved). There are also a lot of cases where the person is issuing a false complaint do to pressure or threat from another party (a father who threatens his daughter because of chastity and the like). And a lot of false rape complaints are made by people who are suffering from mental trauma or illness.  Reporting rape is hard and incredibly traumatising, and our numbers of false complaints are terrible. But given what we do know about false complaints, hard time isn't the answer.  Of course, it should be noted that I'm a HUGE advocate for prison reform so I believe that for a lot of things. I think that our prisons should be focused on rehabilitation not punishment. The only cases where I'm for longer sentencing are cases where the person is a danger to others, and even then, that's only as a half measure (if I can't get the reforms I desperately want, we should at least focus on locking up the people who are dangerous because it's an immediate threat) I think we should punish violent crimes differently and that even if you commit a horrible crime, the kinds of torture and abuse that are common in prison (some, like solitary are a huge part of the system) is totally unacceptable. And it's been shown to make people more violent."

FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,cordis_melum,16,Thu Sep 25 17:14:30 2014 UTC,How typically Reddit. :(
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,FlyingApple31,9,Wed Sep 24 23:12:36 2014 UTC,"Any time a woman comes forward to accuse someone of rape, she knows that she is setting herself up to be accused of lying about it.  To come forward anyway takes courage, because chances are high that your case won't meet the burden of criminal proof - and by default some will always think of you as a liar.  It is disturbing because there is an undeniable trade-off that more protection for men against false accusation means less protection for women who come forward - and vis versa - because the human mind can't handle ""well, we'll never know for sure"" very well."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,the253monster,7,Thu Sep 25 07:34:21 2014 UTC,"For context, the question it was answering was, ""What crime should have a tougher punishment?"""
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,weredditforthreedays,21,Wed Sep 24 22:39:13 2014 UTC,"1.) It's wrong because ACTUALLY RAPING people doesn't ruin lives. See also: Steubenville foot ball players, probably most perpetrators of sexual violence, NFL, etc.  2.) There are very few false rape reports. And the false reports are usually people pretending to have been raped by a stranger. And looking at any statistic you have to keep in mind that the people who decide if the report was real or not are fallible. And usually men. It's pretty hard to get an idea of the number of false reports, but 2-8% is agreed upon by actual researchers. (Random internet misogynists will say 50% or something.)  3.) Sometimes dude's lives are ruined because they get prosecuted for another person's crime. DNA evidence has done a lot to help protect people from mistakes of the justice system. Should a victim be held responsible for mis-identifying her attacker? I don't think so. And with DNA evidence this isn't as big of a problem any longer.  4.) People don't want to admit that people they know/love are capable of rape. When they hear that their buddy raped someone, it's so much easier to believe the woman had one too many, or is getting revenge, than to believe their friends are rapists.  5.) Are you fucking kidding me about that quote? I know three guys who have been accused of rape. Both had a sit-down with campus and literally nothing else happened to them. Being accused of rape took away one hour of their lives. Give me a fucking break, whiny boys."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,NowThatsAwkward,8,Wed Sep 24 23:28:11 2014 UTC,"(Random internet misogynists will say 50% or something.)   Because they assume that all reports that don't end in a prosecution (around 40%) are ""false reports"". As if police shouldn't investigate leads in a criminal case!   I know three guys who have been accused of rape. Both had a sit-down with campus and literally nothing else happened to them. Being accused of rape took away one hour of their lives. Give me a fucking break   They just take that as evidence of a false rape epidemic. Seriously, yesterday I answered ""What are things Reddit thinks are super common but aren't?"" on AskReddit with ""false rape accusations"". Fair, right? Surely no one think's they're super common. But this was trotted out as opposing evidence:   I've known 3 people who have been accused of rape. All of them were acquitted of charges, but their lives for several months were absolute hell.   That doesn't mean that a) dismissed charges are SUPER COMMON nor b) that there was necessarily a FALSE accusation, just that charges weren't laid. It could have been that they were guilty but with no evidence, or that the victim didn't know for sure who victimized them, so the dudes were just suspects. Do people similarly campaign for police not to investigate people who know someone who's murdered because they might not have done it? That's the whole damn point of an investigation!  But since it was AskReddit, I've so far refrained from replying that. I haven't decided if my poor inbox can handle the ramifications of that."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,weredditforthreedays,3,Thu Sep 25 16:22:05 2014 UTC,"On my campus and social network there is absolutely no ramification for sexual violence. There was a guy who tried to rape an acquaintance of mine. No one ever doubted her, and I never heard anyone defend him. But everyone still hung out with him. (I, of course, refused to even look at or acknowledge him, but we weren't close enough for that to affect him at all.) It's so frustrating."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,warholslittledreamer,5,Thu Sep 25 17:25:31 2014 UTC,"I think the biggest issue here is just with availability heuristic. False accusations of rape are incredibly rare, so every time it happens we hear about it in the media. This just means that it sounds like it's happening way more often than it's actually happening, which leads people to make stupid comments like this."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,misyo,6,Thu Sep 25 14:47:39 2014 UTC,"I hate to be the defeatist here, but this is Reddit- a bastion of young white male bros who live in terror of the false rape accusations but desperately desire to get laid by tons of women . It's almost pathological  to see the frenzy on here. It's like that urban legend of the dude who hides in the back of cars and kills the driver- everyone swears they know a guy who was falsely accused of rape and had his life ruined just like everyone has a cousin whose best friend's sister's friend had an aunt who was killed by the guy in the back of the car. Ya, it does happen from time to time, but the terror of it happening to you (particularly when you're the type of guy who likes to pick up on drunk women specifically to get laid) far exceeds the reality.   Until the Reddit demographics change, we will continue to see more false rape fearmongering."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,Wrecksomething,7,Thu Sep 25 05:31:18 2014 UTC,"It's a misguided but widespread concern, and it causes heaps of serious damage.   Rape investigations 'undermined by belief that false accusations are rife'  Why Don’t Cops Believe Rape Victims?  It's also a treatment reserved uniquely for this crime and specifically when women are victims. It should be upsetting; you're probably sensing the sexism and danger here."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,noname725,7,Thu Sep 25 12:23:46 2014 UTC,"That comment is frustrating and upsetting for a lot of reasons.   It's merely annoying because of how frequently that sort of comment is written on reddit. Guys on reddit are constantly bringing up false rape accusations, often as a tactic to try to silence women talking about sexual assault/harassment they've experienced, and they don't seem to realize that they don't happen as often IRL as they imagine. I've read so many different times that false rape reports are on par with false reports for any other crimes. That hasn't stopped a whole bunch of redditors from being fixated, though.   I also find that comment just really kind of...patronizing? Like, they're presuming to know what actually happened despite not being there. Also, drunken sex implies that consent couldn't have been given, so... It also seems like this person probably thinks of women as ""crazy"" overly emotional creatures who can't just contain our emotions - no, we have to go ruin some poor sap's life because we're just so darn ""crazy""!!  All in all, it's just really frustrating seeing these kinds of people discussing sexual assault and rape because they're so delusional and so singularly-focused. They have narrow definitions of what sexual assault and rape even are - they probably only believe in the ""stranger in a dark alley"" stories - and therefore aren't very respectful and don't take people seriously when they share their experiences. They care more about the smaller number of people whose lives have been affected by false rape accusations than they care about the people who've actually been assaulted/raped. They don't seem to understand that rapists LARGELY go unpunished.   I don't know, it feels like a lot of them just have a lot of problems with women and this is yet another way for them to trash women."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,SomeOldGoat,2,Thu Sep 25 07:08:00 2014 UTC,"If it's any consolation, there was an AskReddit thread yesterday that was ""What are things Reddit thinks are super common but aren't?"" and false rape accusations were ALL OVER that thread (as in people saying they weren't that common, not...people falsely accusing each other of rape)."
FemmeThoughts,2hdbgl,Pixelated_Penguin,1 point,Thu Sep 25 19:58:24 2014 UTC,"Because   (1) There already are tough penalties for falsely reporting a crime  (2) Nearly every woman who reports a rape has to already run a gauntlet of teasing out whether she's making it up  (3) This attitude suppresses MANY legitimate rape complaints and leaves the problem under-reported and under-prosecuted  (4) The poster probably has access to all of that information, but prefers to maintain a worldview where there is no rape culture; rape accusations are really more of a weapon women use against men to police sex."

Disciplined. I think of the centuries of imminent fear that have shaped and contoured African-American working-class cultures of discipline, the sternness of our mothers’ and grandmothers’ looks, the firmness of the belts and switches applied to our hind parts, the rhythmic, loving, painful scoldings accompanying spankings as if the messages could be imprinted on our bodies with a sure and swift and repetitive show of force.""

Some men are pricks and will send you abusive shit, but lots of sheep will just read xx like I started to because some of the stuff is interesting, and those are the guys, the majority, that could do with hearing a woman's view on many issues. I'm sure it is vile what happens when you comment there, and some responses you get, but no social change is easy or pain free. Its the quiet uncommenting majority you need to convince that feminism is actually a good thing in general and that sexism is very real and alive. More you do that, more minds you change.

FemmeThoughts,2h2tsa,pelicane136,33,Thu Oct 2 13:55:54 2014 UTC,"Also, the fact remains that there are a lot of feminists who hate men. Unfortunately, those man-hating feminists have some of the loudest voices.   You know, I hear the ""vocal minority"" thing pretty often, but I just don't think that's the case. You know why? Because I can't name a single actual man-hating feminist, at all, from the last ten years. Do they exist? No doubt, I'm sure somewhere I've seen an internet comment from someone who thinks that all men are terrible or whatever, but I literally cannot think of a person's name who thinks that. If the man haters were such a loud and vocal minority, you'd think more people would have heard of them than just angry MRAs who specifically look these man-hating feminists up.   Because the only time I hear something about feminists who hate men, it's someone dredging up an out of context Andrea Dworkin quote from thirty years ago, someone who's already a polarizing figure in feminism as it is. Or it's someone talking about this loud and vocal minority, and then citing some post from a high-schooler on tumblr with fifty followers.   Because the most famous feminists I've actually seen, actually saying their own words and the public hearing them, are like, what... Beyonce? Oh, wow, that crazy radical. Emma Watson? Ellen DeGeneres has made fun of sexism plenty of times, not sure what her official stance on feminism is but she seems pretty awesomely feminist. Like... the most vocal feminists I can think of are all happy fun palatable liberal feminists, there is no vocal tiny minority of screeching harpies that just want to castrate all the men.   It's just a diversion tactic made to force feminists to apologize for their position from the start, and throw radical feminist (but not man-hating) ideas under the bus for being inherently too extreme; and it's also bullshit from anti-feminists who think that reasonable feminist ideas are actually misandry and honestly think that anything that threatens the status quo is radical extremist feminist terrorism. But what it isn't, is a horrible problem within feminism of extremists shouting louder than anyone else. That simply isn't a thing."

FemmeThoughts,2h2tsa,orangelace,15,Thu Oct 2 13:57:37 2014 UTC,"Also, the fact remains that there are a lot of feminists who hate men. Unfortunately, those man-hating feminists have some of the loudest voices. So merely wishing that the ""man-hating feminist"" stereotype would disappear, isn't going to work. Feminists who want to end that stereotype are going to need to eventually confront the feminists who enact that stereotype.   I think that's absurd.  Feminism, like all the other -isms, has no membership cards, no entrance test, no governing body.  If you want to call yourself a feminist, you can do so, and nobody can stop you.  That's as true for you and I as it is for Sarah Palin or Witchwind (a somewhat infamous blogger who more-or-less does live up to the man-hating stereotype).  So Watson said:   The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women’s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. [...] If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop.   That seems pretty clear.  In some quarters it has become synonymous with man-hating, which is certainly isn't, and that does need to stop.  But you say:   That there are ""a lot"" of feminists who hate men. That they have some of the loudest  voices That to end the stereotype we need to confront them   I think every element of that is false.  Very, very few feminists ""hate men"", and they usually have incredibly quiet voices; what attention they get is usually from the enemies of feminism looking to stir up controversy.  And most importantly, yelling at someone like, eg Witchwind will do absolutely nothing.  She's not going to go away, nor should she be expected to.  Worse, you're framing this as ""feminists must confront the fringe in order to stop being viewed as man haters"".  That puts the onus on us to somehow redeem feminism.  How does that work?  There are terrible trans people, Democrats, christians, atheists, vegetarians, Finnish people...why is it only feminists that need to cast out our fringe before we have the right to be viewed neutrally?  And, again, how are we meant to cast these people out?  Come to that, how are we meant to identify them?  Ask a conservative to name some ""man hating feminists"", and you're likely to get back a list of prominent feminists from every school of thought, but with no actual citations for what they're meant to have said that is ""man hating"" but merely some variation on ""well, I read an article that said that she'd said something bad in some speech...somewhere.  No I don't have an actual transcript.""  I'm not suggesting that you are arguing in bad faith, but I believe you are advancing a narrative that was constructed in bad faith in a cynical attempt to hurt feminism.  Feminism is not dominated by loud man-hating feminists, and we do not need to form a House Unfeminist Activities Committee to ferret out the man-haters in our midst.  It's not just pointless, it's actively counterproductive.  What we need to do is say ""yeah, feminism isn't about man-hating; that's bullshit needs to stop""."
FemmeThoughts,2h2tsa,codayus,7,Fri Oct 3 16:45:12 2014 UTC,"Agreed, but what I find to be the biggest problem with the perception of feminism, is that SO often, everyone who is telling people what feminism is, and what they believe, are people who strongly oppose the entire concept.   To me I thought,* Yes, I agree with these various ideas on how and why we can better living conditions for women in areas where they are treated differently based entirely on the basis of sex.* and then came to the conclusion, I guess I'm a feminist.  But time and time again I have opposers quoting people I have never even heard of, to me, and holding up their beliefs as mine. I call this the 'feminist hivemind' concept.  Because most of the time, I have to clarify again and again, I don't speak for any other person, nor do they speak for me, there is no feminist rule book. We don't have a hivemind, or an overlord (Overlady?).  But I can see so many comments, just on reddit, ""this is what feminist think', 'this is why feminists are hypocrites, 'this is why feminists are awful stupid people etc'  I literally do not have any beliefs the average man would disagree with.

What the article actually is is a listicle of TVs ""strong female characters"", only it's a pretty awful listicle. Not only is it incredibly low effort, but it includes some pretty awful characters too.  Clara for example has been around for over a season and has had pretty much zero character for all of that time. The episode they reference, yeah, she finally gets some character but she defines herself in terms of not being as low as other women which is kinda gross. And including Vastra and Jenny?

I personally believe it's an issue of a lack of platform and voice for non-Western people. As the article outlines, white Westerners all too often run the show when it comes to discussing privilege and oppression, which means many voices get lost or left out altogether. I think part of that is the comfortable ignorance we're allowed to live in, as is also noted in the article. There's very little push to further cultural understanding from the prospective of non-Western, non-white peoples in the West, at least from what I've seen in the U.S.  Edit: a cop thinking you're a terrorist or a prostitute isn't really a microaggression.

One skirt was fairly short and tight, and a woman I am friendly with said, ""Ooh, lala,"" and that was the only clue I had that it was a bit too much, but I appreciated it. Though I don't know if I'd have appreciated it from a man, so you're off the hook there.    Another time I wore a long skirt with a high slit in it (my mom gave it to me, so I thought it must be decent). I noticed a bit too many guys complimenting my looks while looking down, and one guy hugged me twice, with I think a boner both times. (This is an indication of how clueless I am, as it took me a while when looking back to really see his intents.) That was not ok--I wish someone told me so it would sink into my dense head. But again, preferrably a woman who had tact (versus condecension).    So, yeah, don't tell her, but it would be nice if a woman coworker just let her know that those working there had opinions about her skirts. Then she can make up her own mind. It's just the not knowing that mostly bothered me, and the extra attention from men that confused me.

There are a lot of shows that clearly have characters who would in real life have chosen abortion get a magical 'out' somehow, either changing their minds at the last minute or miscarrying."
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,alittleperil,10,Tue Sep 16 17:31:50 2014 UTC,"Good Girls Avoid Abortion    When a female character has an unexpected and/or unwanted pregnancy, someone may allude to the possibility of abortion (  usually without saying the 'A' word  ). However, she will likely _ not _ have an abortion for one of three reasons:   She dismisses it immediately because of her religious/spirutual/moral beliefs or  upbringing  , or because she distrusts the procedure (especially if it would involve a  Back-Alley Doctor  ).  She thinks it over for a while, then decides that, no, she's going to keep the baby. This may be followed by a  Convenient Miscarriage  . Which, ironically, she will never be relieved by; she'll be sad because now she wanted it.  She actually decides to have it done, but somehow things don't turn out as she expects, and her attempted abortion is  aborted  .    If she actually goes through with the abortion, and doesn't suffer gruesome complications from the procedure or a certain amount of moral guilt and uncertainty afterwards, it's usually to show that she's a deeply damaged, screwed-up individual. If this happens, but it is played for laughs, it's a  Black Comedy  . It can be played that she made this decision and she is ok with it, but she is then targeted by an anti-abortion fanatic who wants to execute her as a ""murderer."" If the male character who got her pregnant voices support for the abortion option, it's played as a  Kick the Dog  moment to show what a  jerkass  the guy is.  Part of the reason for this is to both avoid the wrath of the  Moral Guardians  , and as well as avoid polarizing the audience (though this can happen anyway if her decision not to abort is made in a hamfisted manner), but it's mostly because if the character had an abortion and everyone went home happy,  it would make for an uninteresting and/or short story  . Writing a character who has an abortion and feels ambivalent or uneasy about her choice is generally verboten. However, if the character decides to keep the child, a large avenue of potential plot lines opens up for the writer to exploit. For example, new Characters, all manner of  Character Development  and  Wedding and Engagement Tropes  , etc.  The other 'a' word (adoption) hardly ever enters into consideration even if abortion itself is ruled out. There are several reasons for this. In serial media such as television and comic books, a baby given up for adoption can be seen as a dangling plot thread that the audience will expect to be  picked up some day  . Also, adoption requires carrying the baby to term. If the woman merely needs to figure out what to do with the baby, this is irrelevant, but if she wants to conceal the fact that she was ever pregnant to begin with, it may not suffice. And abortion can be counted on to get a stronger reaction from the audience than adoption. Similar story logic applies to why we rarely see women taking advantage of the  safe-haven laws ![](http://static.mediatropes.info/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif)  that exist in all 50 states and simply allow them to ""surrender"" a child to the state without even contacting an adoption agency.  Most importantly, however, is that this trope turns upon the false  Begging The Question  choice between responsibility and personal freedom. From a narrative standpoint, adoption is a kind of a cheat since it allows the woman to have both, thus allowing the author to resolve the conflict  without answering the underlying question  . If adoption _ is _ mentioned, it will usually be ruled out with some justification or other.  ** No real life examples please.

FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,meldolphin,18,Wed Sep 17 08:33:10 2014 UTC,"My exboyfriend is super into Homeland and I have never watched it. I caught part of one episode from this past season where the main character finds out she's pregnant and during the whole time she's been pregnant she's been drinking heavily and taking medication for her mental condition. The doctor then shamed her for being such a terrible pregnant woman and never once was, ""Hey, maybe you should have an abortion because you literally just got out of the psych ward and can hardly handle your own life"" ever brought up.  I have no idea how it panned out but that little 5 minute scene really pissed me off."
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,twistedfork,1 point,Tue Sep 16 21:32:09 2014 UTC,"That's super fucked up. Especially because people really discount mental health issues and pregnancy. One of the most dangerous and deadly complications you can have is depression, and it's where a lot of pregnancy related deaths come from.  And yet, we sweep that under the rug because pregnancy is beautiful and natural."
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,hermithome,15,Fri Sep 19 03:54:54 2014 UTC,"Grey's Anatomy has dealt with abortion, pregnancy and motherhood incredibly well.  They've shown pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, infertility, and adoption. They've shown multiple women who had no interest in children who were in relationships with people who did. Some of the women eventually changed their mind, some didn't. They've also shown the various pressures women face. They've shown women pressured to continue pregnancies they didn't want, and working mothers shamed for not being there all the time.   And these are the main characters who deal with this stuff, not just the one-offs, though they do have excellent one-offs as well, like the woman who asked to have her tubes secretly tied during her c-section because she couldn't handle any more children and the church (and her husband) forbid birth control.  They've also shown the consequences for children who are raised by mothers who don't want them. There's an incredible scene where a woman who's mother did not want children speaks to a man who's trying to pressure his partner into keeping a pregnancy she doesn't want. She talks about what it's like growing up being an unwanted child.   They've also discussed the politics of abortion and religion recently, which has been a really nice sorta ongoing storyline in the past season.   It's the only show I can think of that consistently approaches keeping a pregnancy as only one option. When someone says their pregnant, the response generally is to ask them how they feel about it, and what they plan to do. It's treated in a very normative way. And it has been since the very first season.  Also, the spin-off Private Practice tackled abortion regularly as well. Shonda Rhimes is awesome.  I can't think of another writer / show that has treated abortion so normatively and hasn't shied away from it."

And, I'll never remember being in the acute clinic after telling a girl who didn't want the pregnancy (and was booked in to have a termination the next week) that she hadn't miscarried - told the consultant who was there who told her ""congratulations!""."

I usually slip it in the end, something like ""would you like a prescription for folic acid now, in case you want to start trying again? but I worry it's a bit awkward - thoughts?"
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,kochipoik,2,Thu Sep 18 19:31:26 2014 UTC,"I mean, you never really know. Assuming a narrative is, as I said earlier, a terrible idea. Maybe they had been trying, planning and have changed their minds.  Maybe they weren't and want to start.  If it were me, I'd ask off the bat whether or not this was wanted, and go from their. Maybe they'll be very forthcoming with details, maybe not. Either way, at the end you can say ""If you are interested in trying to get pregnant, I can write you a prescription for folic acid"" and give a brief explanation of what it does.  If they've told you they were trying, you can change that to ""trying again"" and so on. If the person has made it abundantly clear that they don't children / pregnancy / etc right now, respect that. Maybe say something like ""If at some point you do plan on trying to get pregnant, please come in for a X visit, so that we can do A, B, and C"".  That way it's very respectful. You respect their choices, by listening to them, but also by giving them all their options.  A lot of women do have children after having an abortion or miscarriage, so respecting their body and their choices and leaving open doors for them is really important. Because a lot of times, women are shamed, or try to hide an abortion from a future partner or OBGYN. Treating miscarriages and abortions as part of standard health care, something that doesn't have a huge stigma or preclude them from anything else is really the best thing you can do."

I also make sure to tell them that it was not their fault, and will expand if they seem interested/ask more. IE, miscarriages are a natural thing and nothing you did would have caused it. Most women look pretty relieved to hear that as I imagine they (or others) have been mentally blaming them for it"

FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,hermithome,9,Fri Sep 19 17:24:53 2014 UTC,"They handled it pretty well in Battlestar Galactica. Toward the end of season 2, a girl from Gemenon sneaks onto Galactica because she's pregnant and doesn't want to be. Gemenon is pretty repressive and considers children property of their parents. So there's this big debate over it, as you're wont to do, and in the end, the girl gets an abortion.  However, Roslin, the president, decides that since there are so few humans, abortion needs to be outlawed (after the girl's). I didn't agree with that at all and they never revisit it. Maybe the writers thought back-alley abortions had no place in a show with rape and forced impregnation.  I do think that more shows should have characters not only wrestle with this issue but go through with it as well. It's a surgical procedure and a fairly common one at that. It shouldn't be treated like some shameful, dirty little secret. It should be discussed openly."
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,Brotigone,10,Tue Sep 16 17:01:44 2014 UTC,"To be fair, Roslin's decision was part of a larger political game, and so there is plenty of room to sympathize with her because of what that decision cost her (personally and politically).    Maybe the writers thought back-alley abortions had no place in a show with rape and forced impregnation.   No, I disagree. In fact I ""read"" that episode quite the opposite: they used this issue to show exactly how low Baltar would go for power. They wrote Roselin being forced to make the ""wrong"" decision, and showed how painful that was for her, and what it cost her.  It was a powerful comment on politics, power, AND the abortion debate, but not in the way it seems you read it. :) To oversimplify: by showing the ""bad guys"" were the ones pulling the strings on the outcome of Roselin's decision, it shows something about which ""side"" the writers (and their assumed audience) were on.  Edit: sorry, I realize my BSG analysis is really only tangentially related... sorry to potentially derail!  I agree with everyone here saying I wish more tv shows (especially in the US and mainstream tv) would treat abortion more realistically.   But.... I find it unlikely to happen any time soon given the political climate.  That said, independently created content from networks like Netflix might have a LOT more freedom to treat things more realistically. I vote every rational thinking human being flock to those shows and give them some much-deserved support. :) hehe."
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,nashife,7,Tue Sep 16 17:30:25 2014 UTC,I agree with your interpretation. It deeply hurt Roslin to go against things she said she fought for in the past. I feel that the subject of abortion was treated with the seriousness it deserved.

Ultimately I do think it would be ""in line"" with her character to keep the pregnancy, but it would have been so interesting if she and Rory discussed it.  Ditto for Sooki and Lorelei. Especially because she was under the (false!) impression that Jackson had had a vasectomy!!!  Unfortunately I assume the writers (or producers, or both) thought speaking bluntly about abortion was too provocative for the target audience.

Things were all sorts of weird in the last season.   They didn't have anything to lose.   Except that's more a justification for keeping the pregnancy. Last seasons are notorious for fulfilling dreams, and new babies and pairing everyone up and happily ever afters. Because they just have to show the people getting there, they don't need to continue it afterwards."

FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,noname725,5,Wed Sep 17 08:34:09 2014 UTC,"The first show that I ever saw tackle abortion was Degrassi. I was pretty young when I saw that episode and I didn't know much (if anything) about abortion. At the time I found it to be a pretty emotional episode and I supported the character's decision to have an abortion. Now when I look back on it, I do think that it was pretty well done. It's been a while since I last saw it, so I'm sure it wasn't perfect, but I do think that it was pretty fair. The show didn't seem to judge the character, which is always important."
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,meldolphin,2,Wed Sep 17 03:46:08 2014 UTC,"They actually refused to run that episode in the United States for a while and then finally relented.  Degrassi always struck me as the type of show where they always had to approach each situation from every angle, which made for some rather forced situations.  We had Manny get an abortion, Liberty give her kid up for adoption, and then Mia kept her baby.  I really haven't watched many episodes since the original gang went off to college but I'm just going to go ahead and assume that there's been about 20 more teenage pregnancies since then."
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,meldolphin,2,Wed Sep 17 08:31:11 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I watched the show back when it aired and was mad that I didn't get to see it (and I knew nothing about finding it on the internet back then), so I didn't get to see it for a few years. After a few years they just kind of nonchalantly placed it in one of those ""Every Episode Ever"" marathons, so I finally got to see it then!  The show is far from perfect, but I did think that the abortion episode as a standalone episode was pretty decent. They really have had way too many teen pregnancies and pregnancy scares, but I liked that one episode by itself. Embarrassingly, I still watch the show and it's definitely quite different now!"
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,noname725,2,Wed Sep 17 22:07:41 2014 UTC,"Yeah I lost interest when everyone went off to college.  I'd gotten pretty attached to that gang and from what I saw from the new guys they were all just rehashes of the older characters.  Part of the reason everything feels so crammed is that it's a condensed cast so every issue gets concentrated into one group.  Having multiple teen pregnancies at a high school isn't that weird but if it's confined to the same 20 people it's pretty odd.  That episode was a very tasteful look at the issue and I like that the show didn't really pass judgment on Manny.  Was it her mom who was supportive and her dad wasn't?  Regardless, it let the characters unfold and didn't paint any of them as right or wrong."
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,meldolphin,3,Wed Sep 17 22:21:26 2014 UTC,"I also came to mention Degrassi TNG! I really liked how at first Emma hated the idea of Manny aborting her fetus but then later she's totally supportive and stands up for Manny when Craig's freaking out about the abortion.  I stopped watching shortly after Spinner and Emma got married. I mean, wtf was that? Did they ever even have any screen time together? Maybe when she got chlamydia from Jay at the ravine but I can't really imagine why they'd end up together!  I tried watching it a while ago but I have no idea who any of those people are."

I never really liked Emma that much anyway though.  Also wait, didn't Spinner propose to Ellie first, or am I misremembering things?  I remember one of the teachers used her engagement ring to scratch the mirror which showed that it was real diamond and she freaked out because Spinner couldn't afford it."
FemmeThoughts,2gkhb5,meldolphin,2,Thu Sep 18 01:52:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've definitely lost interest too. I guess I keep watching out of habit and because I started watching when I was, like, eleven, so I just didn't want to quit! I was super attached to the old cast too (I guess since I 'grew up' with them!), so the new characters just aren't quite the same for me. I think that they aren't as interesting or organic anyway, and I agree that a lot of them basically feel like rehashes of the older characters. But yeah, you make a good point - having multiple pregnancies or pregnancy scares at one big school isn't weird at all, but when we're only watching a handful of characters, it starts to feel a little weird and contrived.   That's what I liked most about it too - I didn't feel like the show judged Manny. Some characters might've judged her, but I didn't feel like the show itself was judging her or painting her in a bad light. Her mom was pretty supportive and she also had the support of Emma's mom (and eventually Emma too even though she opposed abortion). It was a pretty sensitively crafted episode!"

Like instead of ""that's a little sexist"" or ""maybe you shouldn't say that at work"" say ""That's sexist, please don't say things like that around me."" This MIGHT work - maybe this guy just needs someone to be really direct - and the advantage would be that you don't have to worry about getting a supervisor or HR involved, which could backfire if they aren't supportive. Of course the disadvantage is that the guy could take it as an attack and retaliate, or he could get worse out of spite. Just depends on how OP thinks the people involved might react."

I'd rather just be messy all around and sort it out as I go, but maybe that's a bad strategy too. You don't really have much to lose... it's like you're afraid of rejection you haven't even received yet and so you're pre-emptively avoiding rejection by not putting yourself out there.

It would never occur to me to try and find a partner who was perfect, I'd try and find someone with, above all, a compatible personality, and ideally a nice person with interesting hobbies, health, life plans, etc.  Maybe flip it around.  If you were trying to date, would you be super judgemental and be looking for someone with everything in a row, or would you accept that, you know, life is hard, and stuff happens?  Would you date a guy that, say, moved back in with his parents because money was tight and he was trying to get a technology startup off the ground, and had no spare cash for fancy dates or gifts?  Or would you limit yourself to well-off guys with good careers?  Would you view a guy not having a car as a red flag, or just an issue to be worked around when planning dates?  Seriously, you're listing stuff like ""has a job"" and ""volunteers a lot"" and ""is working on developing her career"" as negatives.  For most people, those are positives.  Don't worry so much.  :)  TL;DR:  No, I think your therapist nailed it.  (And I'm still feeling weird for typing ""As a man"", even though it's actually kinda relevant here.)"

Maybe I am being too judgmental with myself."

Yeah, if someone comes her way, great, but focusing on finishing her degree and becoming financially stable/independent are important."

But on the other hand it could be like a year  or a bit more from now until I'm 100 percent  financially stable with a full time job and living on my own.  Life happens outside of school - students normally date, even while studying, don't they? or am I too old to be a student? I don't know.

FemmeThoughts,2git5t,chakrablocker,6,Tue Sep 16 22:52:01 2014 UTC,"Well, you're not going to learn much about relationships/sex by being single.

FemmeThoughts,2ghpwu,satanslandlady,1 point,Mon Sep 15 20:16:42 2014 UTC,"question: if you were a woman who interviewed with one of these companies like twitter where 90% of the tech employees are guys but didn't get a job, would this data be grounds for a discrimination lawsuit?"
FemmeThoughts,2ghpwu,softinseattle,23,Mon Sep 15 23:07:00 2014 UTC,"Nope. I work in the tech industry at a company that is largely white and male (at least in product & engineering), and the thing is, they don't intend it to be that way. They honestly, honestly don't. Most of the men I work with are allies, and are genuinely good guys. They want more women to come work with us, and they honestly don't know how to make that happen, because they don't see how the system can be biased even when the individuals within it are not.   Not a single one of them has ever come out of an interview and said, ""Well, that candidate is less qualified because she's a woman,"" but they do adhere to that silly high-stress half-day-grilling-by-several-people-coding-on-a-whiteboard crap that favors a particular kind of personality. They recruit at certain places (and generally send men to recruit because, well, men is what we have), and our job descriptions are written by men about the kind of place they'd like to work.  This article really resonated with me; it addresses a lot of what's wrong with the hiring process in tech, and why it generally favors hiring more of the same.   My point is, the process isn't well-suited to diverse hiring, so until they adjust what a successful interview looks like (or have more than one version of it), it's still going to disfavor women, people of color, lgbt folks, and other underrepresented groups even if the interviewer isn't biased. It's a bummer, but small bits of progress are being made. On our end, the woman at our company badger HR with articles like that and make a lot of recruitment suggestions, and we're moving the needle (a little)."
FemmeThoughts,2ghpwu,electrostaticrain,2,Mon Sep 15 23:52:50 2014 UTC,"I noticed at our recent career fair a lot of the technology firms (not so much the engineering firms) sent recruiters of both genders, which I thought was a pretty cool step. It's starting to not look as bad – from the calculated, marketed outside, anyway. I'm not in the industry yet so I'm not really qualified to comment, but I feel like the push for women in tech is starting to take off and I feel a little more secure in my future than I would have a few years ago."

I think a lot of the representatives at the more ""traditional"" places and engineering companies were in recruiting (there was at least one instance where I asked a more engineering-specific question and the recruiter referred me to the (male) engineer), but two of the major tech companies sent female engineers who were also alumni! It was actually pretty exciting to talk to them and hear about their experiences."

FemmeThoughts,2gaa4n,sophierpi,8,Sat Sep 13 12:57:36 2014 UTC,I certainly approve of your aims. What kind of experience does your team have in publishing? What are your plans to promote the magazine before the launch date? Where will it be stocked?
FemmeThoughts,2gaa4n,katrionatronica,3,Sat Sep 13 14:39:53 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Some of the team have experience on other magazines; I have experience with making my own zines and selling them online. We're thinking of holding some events and workshops before the launch date, and we're going to be using the blog to post short articles that will give an idea of the type of content we'll be making. It's going to be available on our website, when that is made, and then several independent book/journal/magazine stores!"
FemmeThoughts,2gaa4n,katrionatronica,2,Sun Sep 14 13:59:00 2014 UTC,"Sounds good! Out of interest, where geographically do you plan to sell it? Will you be approaching stores outside of London?"
FemmeThoughts,2gaa4n,mewmewmewmewmewmewme,3,Sun Sep 14 20:00:51 2014 UTC,"We are basically going to have a scout around in the UK for potential stores. Then once we've established a base we will expand further and outside of the UK! Basically the main aim is that when (and if) we have a large enough readership (which realistically could take years) we will try and find a distributor who can get the mag into well-known stores, as we want to try and infiltrate the mainstream magazine market."
FemmeThoughts,2gaa4n,mewmewmewmewmewmewme,4,Sun Sep 14 20:21:15 2014 UTC,"I also stand by what this project aims for and am thinking about supporting it but i was disapointed that there was not a small video made to at least introduce the people behind this magazine. Who are you? Will you be speaking from many perspectives or will this be a 'white feminist' magazine? What is this 'goodie bag' refereed to in most of the rewards for supporting the project?   You are asking for submissions, will the issue be entirely submission based? Will these people be paid for creating the content?   ^ The above especially is something I recommend actually budgetting for, even if you are doing a kickstarter. I'm speaking as a freelance illustrator, myself.   It's unfair how often the job prospects I get in my inbox are just people asking for free work. I know it's by choice to submit but it just makes people devalue their own work and time and if you are asking for funds from the public please keep content creators in mind. They are the meat of a magazine..."
FemmeThoughts,2gaa4n,SharkWoman,3,Sun Sep 14 05:39:17 2014 UTC,"The reason there isn't a video introducing everyone is because we are all based in different places - not just throughout the UK, but throughout the world. We are working on a video though, and it will be added soon!   The goodie bags aren't being described in full at the moment because the content hasn't been fully decided yet, however we know for sure that the small ones will have things like stickers, disposable tattoos, post cards, and other little things; the large one will have all of those things as well as larger things like art prints.   The content is mostly made by the team I've put together, all of whom are unpaid. It's not like I'm just giving them work to do and not paying them - we've formed a team, and everyone is inputting ideas and making this work. It's very much a team effort and everyone is really enthusiastic about it. The submissions will make up a very small proportion of the magazine.  It's definitely not just a 'white feminist' perspective. A lot of the content we've put together for the first issue is focussed on race, privilege, representation etc."
FemmeThoughts,2g611v,neverwhere9,10,Fri Sep 12 03:02:08 2014 UTC,"So here's my experience: in my old apartment, my neighbor from across the hallway got raped and stabbed by an intruder.   I bought a stun gun and would keep it out at night if I had to but in general, I would avoid being alone in the streets after dark.   Try and have your SO stay at home with you and walk around with you at night. Your experience is very recent, so the fear and ""shaken-ess"" is very present. You will eventually be ok.  I am not much help but: stun gun and a SO around would help for the first few weeks. The initial shock will eventually fade, as sad and non-compassionate as it sounds."
FemmeThoughts,2g611v,vlaura,21,Fri Sep 12 03:20:04 2014 UTC,"I'm seconding a stun gun or pepper spray, but please practice with them in the daylight first. Practice until you can find them in your purse blindfolded and correctly wield it. It would be awful if you needed to use it and couldn't figure out which way to hold it or spray yourself with mace.   Other tips, pay attention to your surroundings. Don't listen to music (have earbuds in if you want, but no music playing,) don't stare at your phone (try not to even have it out.) Keep your eyes up and your shoulders squared to give off an air of confidence. If you can avoid it, don't venture out at night into unfamiliar areas."

I live in a shady area (my apartment complex had a sex trafficking thing a couple years ago, robberies happen fairly often, cops are always around, seen a few prostitutes). I never go out at night unless it's with my SO, but we don't walk around outside my gated complex.  I feel safe at home because I have two dogs with big barks (sorry not sorry, they're usually quiet, especially at night, but their barking alerted me of a potential robber before fucking around with my patio stuff. Scared him away but he was lingering, possibly to go mess up someone else's place. I called the cops and he was arrested for something else in his records).  Dogs are great guards. My dogs are the sweetest things ever, love other dogs and people, but strangers don't know that.  Now I'm concerned though because there was a crazy dognapping incident on the street outside my place. Someone actually opened another person's car passenger door, cut the dog's leash, grabbed the dog, and drove off in a getaway car. And it was a pit bull they nabbed, one of my dogs' friends :( owners were screaming and people nearby were completely shocked out how brazen it was. They still haven't found them :( I wonder if they stole him to use for fighting or something :("

FemmeThoughts,2g611v,satanslandlady,6,Fri Sep 12 22:58:53 2014 UTC,"I lived alone in Flint, MI. (Actually in Flint, not in one of the cities surrounding it). I also lived and worked alone doing overnight shifts in Seattle.  Consider what makes your neighborhood 'sketchy': Is there a lot of stranger on stranger violence, or is most of it gang and/or family related? I've heard more drunken frat boy harrassment in 'good' neighborhoods to be honest, and more women get raped/sexually assaulted by people they know than strangers. Men who aren't homeless just have an opportunity to get you somewhere private, they're not 'safer'. I guess I don't believe in scaring myself out of my life. I know some people are going to give you concrete tips, but for me it's always been more mental than anything else. That said:  First, if you're scared, you're going to look scared and like a target. People can tell.  Second, wear stuff you can run in.  Third, not just be aware of your surroundings, but get to know them. Who has their lights on late/early in the morning, what are good paths in and out of areas? Know your terrain, it adds to your confidence.  Fourth, I would actually recommend practicing being out alone after dark. If you can't go out after dark, winter is going to suck. At least where I am/am from, it's dark from 4-5 PM to 8 AM. Good luck doing anything except work.  Fifth, if you take the advice to get a weapon, make sure you're comfortable using it and do your research. A weapon that you can use worse than your opponent and can easily be taken from you isn't helpful.  Sixth, dog is a good idea if you can handle them. I know people generally consider that a good idea.  Lastly... if you're truly terrified all the time, move. I know that sounds insensitive, but you can't curtail your life that much."
FemmeThoughts,2g611v,wookiewookiewhat,2,Mon Sep 15 08:50:14 2014 UTC,There's no gang violence that I know of. It seems like mostly stranger on stranger violence to me.

In many ways, we're inured to the really statistically significant dangers, and terribly afraid of things that are unlikely to affect us. We're inured due to normalcy bias and cultural acceptance and terrified due to rarity, severity and cultural stigma. Stranger danger is a big one, largely because it's so hugely played up in society as being the source of all danger.  This is a really good answer, that both makes people think about the real issue here (fear, and that the fear itself both damages and makes you less safe), and giving concrete tips to help someone in that situation feel safer and overcome that fear. Really excellent answer, I loved it."

I live on a huge gang street, but as I walk down it everybody knows me.  Everyone else sees this.  Listen to your instincts.  Only once did I really think I was going to get messed with, and I ignored the feeling.  At the last second I bolted.      Curious, why did you have to rush inside because of frat boys sexually harassing a woman?  Personally I think this is a great opportunity to speak up for someone, but that may not be for everyone.  Did they seem like they were potentially violent?    Also, what type of neighborhood is this?  The presence of frat boys is a bit confusing."

I'm sort of in the middle closer to the sketchier side.   I've actually helped college women being harassed by drunk guys before, but this one was different. I still feel really bad to be honest. Every other time, it was one drunk guy following around a woman and trying to do...I don't know. Something awful.

FemmeThoughts,2g666a,Fairleee,9,Fri Sep 12 04:02:11 2014 UTC,"Had to take my almost 3 year old son shopping for some new shoes the other day. Given that we're coming into Autumn/Winter, we wanted to find him a comfy, sturdy and warm pair of shoes, preferably boots. However, according to a very large chain shoe store in the UK, boys don't wear warm, cosy boots, and the only decent boots they sold with a warm lining were in the girl's section, all with typical ""girly"" designs. Personally, I don't care if he wears girl's shoes, because I don't think there's anything wrong with femininity (in fact one of his current pairs of shoes is a pair handed down from the daughter of one of our friends), but it really bugs me how gendered footwear is for small children. They're feet, for goodness sake! Why can't boys have the same access to warm, snuggly boots when the weather gets cold? Like I said, it doesn't bother me, but most parents are very tied up in these gender roles and it means that as a result boys are missing out, because apparently we've somehow decided culturally that warm, lined, calf-high boots are girly. This shoe shop doesn't even contain a single boy's equivalent; the only boots they sell for boys are either wellies or ankle-high workboot-style boots. This, coincidentally, is the same shoe shop that has faced criticism for the fact that the only colour it sells girls' shoes in is different shades of pink, and was also criticised for a highly sexist advertising campaign where they boasted about how they tested their boys' shoes for ""ruggedness"", whilst their girls"" shoes were designed to be ""fashionable"" - because girls aren't allowed to play rough, and boys can't care about their appearances apparently.  As it happens, my son ended up choosing a pair of the workboot-style boots, but only because he said that he thought they looked like Ana's snow boots from Frozen. So that kind of felt like a win.  /Rant"

Our spankies(underwear type thing you wear under a cheerleading skirt) were bright yellow, so I had a huge blood stain. My coaches were all rushing around trying to find an extra pair, because we were up in like ten minutes. They found an extra pair, but they were royal blue, so mine didn't match everyone else's.   Then someone handed me a tampon. I knew the basic idea of inserting it, but I had never done it before and I was so stressed that I couldn't get it in right.

One day after a seven or eight hour session (I wish I were kidding) I experienced the most horrific agony of my young life.  Long story short, told mom, went to the ER, got barium pumped into me at both ends, got X-rayed.  The doctor I saw gave me the filthiest look when I answered his question honestly and explained that I'd been masturbating shortly before the pain began.  Then came the joy of voiding all that barium in a bathroom with amazing acoustics about ten feet away from said doctor, my mother, and the most attractive nurse I'd ever seen.  As it turns out, prolonged arousal can result in severe vasocongestive cramps.  Wouldn't have minded if they'd covered that in sex ed.  Hell, my mom's a nurse and she had no idea what was going on.

We were all staying in one hotel room in Washington DC, so there was no way to hide this from anyone. I remember seeing blood and yelling for my mom. I refused to come out of the bathroom until she went to the store and came back with pads. She also bought me Kit Kats, which was pretty rad."
FemmeThoughts,2g4dt0,MarthaGail,8,Thu Sep 11 21:57:32 2014 UTC,"Aw, the first time I tried a tampon was one I had borrowed from a classmate when no one had any pads. I didn't know how far to push it in so I decided just barely was the better choice. I chose poorly.  I think after the next class I took it out and was on the verge of tears when the girl that had given it to me saw I was upset and asked. She told me. After that moment, it was always tampons for me! I went home and asked my mom to buy them and then I read the little pamphlet front and back."

Tons and tons of bright red blood. Mom and Dad cleaned it up while I died of embarrassment. Dad gave me an awkward hug and said something about welcome to womanhood (whyyyyy).  Later in the afternoon, my mom came and said she wanted to talk to me. She tearfully welcomed me to womanhood and gave me a big red crystal prism and said I was no longer a little girl. Also something New Age-y about capturing my womanhood and welcoming the moon. Uggggh. It was the last thing I wanted to hear as an embarrassed, crampy, super tomboyish 13 year old. My mom just picked the worst time to be sentimental and try to celebrate my ""womanhood"".  Bonus: I didn't understand that you get a period every month. I thought you got it once and then poof!

I mean, I'm pretty sure I'd had sex ed by then, but no one actually told me that a cervix could stick out at all, I thought it was just like... I dunno, flat or something. That was stressful.

I was a late bloomer. I didn't get boobs until almost 10th grade, and then they were enormous by my senior year, but this isn't about that. It was the shame of wearing a training bra in front of all of my already busty-ish friends in real bras. Puberty does mean things to girls' personalities sometimes and considering I was emotionally a late bloomer as well (didn't like boys yet, wasn't into makeup, fairly sheltered, had zero crushes and didn't care to) I acquired a new ""nickname"".

The rest of the day was pretty damned horrible. Because I didn't have extra pads, I couldn't change them, and it was the heaviest day, so it inevitably leaked. So I was bleeding into the plastic chairs and being mortified. I stood up the entire time during rehearsal because I didn't want to get blood into the plush seats, and as soon as I could go home, I ran home, changed my clothes (which were now sopping wet with period blood), and ran back to rehearsal.

As a horny young woman, I honestly did not mind. Well I had a huge crush on this Junior boy named Miles, who had a very publicly affectionate relationship with a barbie. To quote Megan's Body, they were doing some real varsity moves. It was hot. Anyway, now after the context of the story, the story itself. This was back in the day of the floppy disk, those cheap plastic things that you had to carry 100 of because half of them didn't work. One day in tech lab Miles asked me to borrow a floppy, which I obliged eagerly by digging through my horrendously unorganized and overstuffed messenger bag. Upon pulling out the lime green object I became aware of a giant pink wrapped feminine pad stuck beneath the metal plate on the disk. Miles also became aware of this. I died. The end. No, actually he was pretty smooth about it, smirked a bit at my humiliation and graciously accepted the floppy after I removed the cursed pad. The other dudes in the class who happened to see it pretty much never let it go. This is why I only use tampons to this day 10 years later."

I was at a friend's house, went to the bathroom, and when I wiped it looked like black tar. All I knew about my period was that eventually blood would come out of my vagina, and I equated blood with bright redness, not this black shit. Long story short I start crying, thought I was dying, friend's mom talked me through it (after I showed her the black.)   My second period happened at school. i wasn't prepared. All my school had was some super cheap tampons with cardboard applicators, which I quick discovered I can't use.

Editors work with the specific audiences, and the culture of the market they're used to writing/editing for is going to be more of an influence on their photoshop jobs than the culture of a country as a whole.  Not to mention, a given country's idea of beauty is going to be pretty diverse, and labeling these with a country seems to assume that the entire culture of that country is uniform, which simply isn't true.  At a glance, these ""studies"" are interesting, but if you put just a few minutes of thought into it, you realize it's pretty meaningless, and definitely doesn't show what the writer seems to claim it shows."

When I first heard about it, I thought it would be interesting but still mostly written to prove a point. But it's a great book as well, and I found it super funny (a bit of an achievement imho when taking on such a depressing task as really diving into all aspects of gender inequality. I think her use of humour is brilliant, and I know it got the book widely read by people who were then forced to think over some things they might never have otherwise).  The book came out in the 70s, and became an instant cult classic and a topic of debate in Norway. Since then, it's been translated to many languages. Here's the link to the English version: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/417157.Egalia_s_Daughters and I saw it was on amazon, too.

FemmeThoughts,2fv9dt,helloiamsilver,15,Tue Sep 9 14:22:42 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure. A lot of those scripts still seem very familiar to me. I think we treat ""gay"" assault victims very similar to women.   Exhibits A & C have classmates egging it on, versus hazing incidents. Exhibits B & D are cases of serious pedophilia, versus Catholic Church sex scandals. Victims are still blamed, ignored, punished.   Describe rape examples (like this article) and people will say it's wrong no matter the genders. Somehow when the cases really surface we always find a way to blame victims. Gender at best seems to change the specific rape myth we invoke."
FemmeThoughts,2fv9dt,foreverburning,19,Tue Sep 9 04:28:52 2014 UTC,"Sure, we still blame them, but the blame is different and I think, very gendered.  When we talk about gay assault victims, the language is often blaming, but in a different way. We recognise that it's assault, but they deserve it, for perversion or being weak, or being feminine.  Hazing victims, yeah, we blame them, but again, in a different way. The ""what did you expect"" overlap is fairly close to similar, but again, we recognise the assault for what it is. The language there blaming is more about them deserving it, in the way that an arsehole deserves to be punched.  And when we talk about things like the Catholic Church scandals, that was mostly not believing the kids, or believing that kids ""misinterpreted"" what happened.  Sure, there's definitely some overlap. And yes, victims are still blamed, ignored or punished. But it's really only in women being raped by men situations where we get this language about girls acting older than their age, women being too sexy, and men not being able to help themselves. There's this weird natural language that we apply, where we decide that men who are tempted can't help themselves (nature) and that women are to blame because they seduced them (by wearing a skirt, or having boobs, or smiling or whatever). A lot of the time we don't even really recognise it as assault, we treat it as sex, or men acting ""naturally"" or ""on instinct"".  And that's something that really doesn't happen to men. Yes, male victims are still blamed and ignored and punished, but the language is often very different."
FemmeThoughts,2fv9dt,fuschialady,12,Tue Sep 9 05:03:32 2014 UTC,"There are differences, you're right. It just doesn't seem as simple as the article sounded. We still hear ""(gay) guys can't control themselves,"" except it's usually a prejudice against the perp as much as a rationalization of assault.  Which is another thing. I'm nervous the gender-swap reinforces some homophobia or a hierarchy of victims. The article knows we're more shocked by ""sodomy"" than by ""straight"" assault and makes us challenge that. But for some people, this message is like: ""How much you fear gay guys, that's how you should feel about all rape.""   It's an interesting comparison that does reveal some big truth. I don't think I would use it to try to change someone's mind though. Too complicated overall."
FemmeThoughts,2fv9dt,Retsejme,12,Tue Sep 9 05:52:47 2014 UTC,"But for some people, this message is like: ""How much you fear gay guys, that's how you should feel about all rape.""    Yeah, I'm aware of the play on homophobia that's involved. But I don't know how else to get through to some people. You see comments all the time where guys would be totally okay with someone having sex with them while they were passed out drunk. Because they see it as sex, because it isn't penetration, because they don't see women as threatening and so on. As soon as you change that image to being penetrated by a man, they go ""whoah"".  So, yeah, I'm aware of the issues, but I'm not willing to simply avoid that line of thought. Because it's really the only way for a lot of men to step into women's shoes.  And there's also the fact that homophobia is intrinsically and inexcapably tied into misogyny, and the idea that women are weaker, and inferior. A lot of queer male authors have talked about the various hatred they get and how the worst of it always stems from straight up misogyny.   It just doesn't seem as simple as the article sounded.    Well, sure, but that's about who the intended audience is. This isn't a feminist theory piece, it's a piece aimed at getting laypeople to take a step back and analyse where their feelings on this issue come from.   a hierarchy of victims   I don't think it does that all. As awful as the various blaming that other victims get, they are at least, mostly, recognised as victims. Maybe they aren't liked, or believed. Maybe they are blamed, or ignored. But, instinctively, they are recognised as victims. And if we can use a gender flip to get people to start recognising that female victims of rape and assault are indeed victims, that's an important step.    It's an interesting comparison that does reveal some big truth. I don't think I would use it to try to change someone's mind though. Too complicated overall.    I still find it useful. Even when they are seriously homophobic, gender flips make people step back and analyse why they feel the way they do. And I think that's a really crucial first step. Considering why you think and feel the way you do doesn't change opinions over night, but it's hard to change opinions without that first step. There are a lot of people that have a lot of hateful opinions. And sometimes you have to use some of those to begin to break through to them."

DMCA complaints were entirely what forced reddit to take fappening down as far as I can tell.  As far as candidfashionpolice (aka creepshots) stuff, it's almost entirely taken by creepsters in public, which means it's only illegal in jurisdictions with anti-creepshot laws. Unfortunately even in a jurisdiction where creepshots are illegal, the liability is probably entirely on the perpetrator and it's likely not possible to hold reddit liable for abetting the illegal behavior.

FemmeThoughts,2fq43u,miscreantpossum,2,Sun Sep 7 15:49:04 2014 UTC,"but I personally find the psychological pain of an ""ugly"" chronic illness to be the heaviest to carry.   Same. My hypothyroidism caused me to gain 40kg in two years when I was already 120kg and I was honestly doing well until everything went to shit with my body which caused my depression and generalised anxiety get to the point where I was housebound. I'm going to have a hard as fuck time trying to get my weight down to where I want to be because my conditions mean that my body LOATHES the process of losing weight and will try to keep it on. I struggled with getting doctors to even give me the medication for it because my results were ""within range"" despite the fact I had a 7 page symptom list and was really struggling. I kept being referred to psych because my doctor refused to treat it but my psychiatrist didn't want to deal with my depression until my thyroid was medicated. It's left me feeling very skeptical of doctors and I just don't trust them much anymore.   I also have hidradenitis suppurativa which is a chronic skin inflammation disorder where the body gets covered in cysts and abscesses in any area where skin to skin contact occurs. It's going to be something I have for life and can expect to get worse. I already woke up this morning to see dried blood on my skin from a cyst that burst. It's horrific. I don't personally feel it about this disorder in specific but a lot of people feel ugly for it, because the skin gets littered with marks and holes basically. I've said to my SO I would rather have worse hypothyroidism over this, but sadly I can't choose.   Earlier this year I've been at points where I was so much on the edge that killing myself seemed like my only choice.   It's the psychological pain that hurts the most."
FemmeThoughts,2fq43u,qu1ckbeam,4,Sun Sep 7 21:31:42 2014 UTC,"I think it is important to be cognizant of these things. I think people forget so easily. Like I once told my friend who has an arthritic knee ""laaaame"" when he wouldn't come out for a drink. I don't think he took it the wrong way, but I didn't recognize it until after I'd done it. At the same time, I've caught him saying ""retarded"", so even people living with disabilities aren't perfect either.  I try to be a sensitive person without being pitying. My friend that I've known for over 10 years now has ridiculous asthma and is allergic to cats so when I think she might come over (she actually loves playing with the cats, lol) I go out and I buy Benadryl or Claritin to have on hand and I vacuum the shit out of the apartment the day before. Like even the lamp shades. And I purposely do it the day before, because I know doing it the same day might leave dander in the air. But I do all this because I've known her for ten years, and I know what meds she takes, and I know when her asthma is bad. With my friend with arthritis, it's a lot harder because I've known him a shorter time - it's hard when you haven't trained yourself to do the right things for each friend yet.  Basically, I think it's good to try your best to accommodate people with chronic conditions. But I also think it's good for people to be understanding when others drop the ball. I have IBS (obviously not the worst chronic condition to have) and sometimes I just can't leave the house or I have to leave in the middle of stuff. I don't really expect people to be ""sensitive"" towards me, but at the same time I would hate it if they gave me shit for it. Unless they're okay with me making a ton of gross poop jokes in response."
FemmeThoughts,2fpv0j,blondiekat,8,Sun Sep 7 13:56:38 2014 UTC,"I think the issue for me is that I feel like people misunderstand what ""cool"" really is. I had a friend in college put his finger on it once, and I still remember it because it really changed how I thought about it. He pretty much said, ""Being cool isn't about the car you drive, or if you're in a frat, or even what you're into. Being cool is just being really comfortable with yourself and at ease - and you feel that same way about the people you meet."" That really opened my eyes, and I do try to be the ""Cool Girl"" now, in that I try to be really nice, warm, and caring to everyone. I still have a cynical/sarcastic bite to my sense of humor that is also sometimes self-deprecating, but my close friends and coworkers know (I hope) that if they need help with anything, that I'm their girl.  That being said, it is really fun to meet people with similar interests and tastes to yours. Or at least what you consider to be good/interesting interests and tastes. And I think that some people do exhibit a lot of the traits talked about that aren't pretending or faking it. I do quite enjoy chili dogs... though I'm not a size 2. :) And I like ""boy"" things - I like Magic the Gathering (though I don't have people to play with anymore) and I was into D&D for a while (that was more of ""a lot of my friends do it, I'll give it a shot""). I love action and horror movies - as well as remade fairy tales and coming of age stories.   I'm kind of rambling, sorry. The point I'm trying to make is that I think the ""cool girl"" has become the idea of finding a woman who is just like them but has boobs and a vagina. And unfortunately, that's not going to happen, because he wouldn't be able to find a male friend just like him either! I don't think the interests you hold is the problem - I think the real problem is that they expect someone to like everything that they like and to never disagree or hold separate opinions. There is no such thing as the ""cool girl"", really. What these men are looking for is a blow-up doll."

FemmeThoughts,2fpv0j,milkjr,3,Sun Sep 7 19:22:15 2014 UTC,"Fake it 'til you make it. :) In my Intro to Psych class years ago we learned that if you're in a bad mood or feeling down, smiling will actually make you feel better even if you aren't happy. If you spend enough time doing this, your mood will lighten. My prof called it ""Faking it until you make it.""  So, I stopped fat talking (still have my bad days). I remind myself that people enjoy my company, and even if they don't, that's okay! I remind myself that people love me, and I'm interesting, smart, and capable. When I'm feeling good about myself, I can treat other people kindly. I try to help anyone who asks for it. I've stayed late, on Friday nights, to help coworkers with their work when we have deadlines. I try to drop in on people just to chat with them and see how they're doing. I try to remember birthdays (kind of bad about that). And honestly I just tell people how much I like them all the time. I know that sounds silly, but I think it makes people feel good. Also, don't expect anything in return for your friendliness! (Although I have to say, pretty much all of my coworkers remembered my bday, and three of them did something special for it!)  I'm aggressively friendly, I think is a good way to sum up. Unless you're really mean to me, and then I'll just ignore you, because I don't need that shit bringing me down! That's the other thing. Trim the fat, get rid of all the toxic people in your life bringing down your self-esteem. If someone's constantly telling you negative things about yourself, and you spend a lot of time beating yourself up about stuff, you can't focus on anyone else. Which is okay when you're just starting out with having positive self-esteem, but eventually you have to spread the good vibes! :)  edit: spelling"

I grew up with a lot of beliefs such as ""People don't take me seriously"" or ""I must be perfect or strive for perfection 24/7"" and they influenced how i saw the world and myself. I had to learn how to give myself a break, allow myself to be human, and recognize the good qualities i have for myself.   And through a lot of hard work, i now have a very functional self esteem. I still have some dark days where i think i'm a piece of shit, but they're fewer and farther in between. And things have started falling into place. I have a job now that i love, i'm going to school, i'm making friends easier, and i no longer feel like a total train wreck. It's simple work, i guess, but it's really hard.

I also had my older sister to look up to, she taught me a lot through example.   A lot of it was just getting out of my own head and trying to look at life with as clear of a perspective as possible.

FemmeThoughts,2fq1rp,teabagcity,8,Sun Sep 7 23:10:19 2014 UTC,"""it's important for women to have high self-esteem"" - technically true but unnecessarily specific in my opinion IMO. It's important for every person to have a high self-esteem. There's a distinction that is deemed significant in pop psychology circles, the difference between internal and external motivation.  Basically, doing something you don't hold important but you feel others do would qualify as something done under an external motivator, and doing things because you feel they are personally important to you would be done under internal motives.  Where confidence and self-esteem is born (at least that has been my experience) is when you feel your internal motivation guides you to do things which are also socially accepted, to be more precise, when what feels naturally for you to do is also what is excepted and rewarded. So instead of doing things you think you are supposed to do, try doing things you want to do, and find which of those also satisfy option no.1. You can start with some simple things, like going out and choosing a piece of clothing because you like the way it looks, regardless of how you feel others would perceive it. You would be surprised how much positive feedback you can get, not that that's the goal here, but it is encouraging to still feel like you wouldn't completely fall out of the frame. Even if someone said, wow, I really don't like that shirt on you, it is important for you not to put that person's opinion above your own. They obviously don't see it the same way you do, but that does not mean their perspective is any more valuable than yours. Having self-confidence doesn't mean never getting negative societal feedback, it means getting it sometimes but not taking it to heart.  At the end of the day, you need to decide taking a risk someone won't like you is a far lesser evil than not expressing yourself.    I personally had no self-esteem growing up, I was very much the odd one out in almost every aspect I could think of. It's not that I was ignored by my peers (I would have taken that as a better alternative any time of day); I was systematically bullied and notorious for my lack of social skills. I assumed this all made sense; I was sure the problem was me. I mean, there just was no way everyone else was in the wrong. I kept trying to decode a way to behave properly, to stay out of the negative spotlight, but it just wasn't working for me. I was sure they had excess to a completely different level of human interaction and life in general. I sincerely believed I was disabled in some huge, tangible way (my parents never did anything about it because I was an exemplary student and I didn't talk much about how other kids treated me at school).  The more I grew up, the more I started seeing holes and inconsistencies in people around me and their behavior. I saw that formula I spent all my time looking for didn't actually exist, that those people behaved differently than me but it was in no way more arranged. They too did what came naturally to them, the only difference is in what that was. Then teenage years kicked in, and I decided I didn't give a fuck anymore. Years later, I'm still the odd one out, but I feel incomparably different about it. I don't see it as a bad thing, I see it as a part of my character. In time I found people who liked/tolerated me in my natural state, or even appreciated it as a quality on its own. To be a bit morbid, but it's a thing that comes to mind now, back then I really thought nothing would be any different if someone killed me. Then I woke up one morning and thought it would be a shame if something happened to me. That's kinda when I knew I took a meaningful turn in the right direction.   I hope you will find some of this to be helpful. TL;DR: Yes, I believe self-esteem is important, yes the power is in your hands."

I used to have really poor self esteem but when I started having much better self esteem, I took myself less seriously and people naturally gravitated to my sense of humor. I constantly tell myself to ""act like a queen, be treated like a queen.""  This goes for everything I do: ""act with kindness, be treated with kindness; act with confidence, be treated with reassertion; act with compassion, receive compassion.""  I feel what I project is, for the most part, what I get in return. Whether this is true or not doesn't really matter because the most important part is my perception of myself. I hope that made sense."
FemmeThoughts,2fq1rp,xaynie,1 point,Mon Sep 8 17:05:07 2014 UTC,"I agree, having people that also support you and think you're awesome too makes the difference. I began my journey to confidence by looking at the people in my life and thinking hard about how they treated me. Removing toxic people from your life will help you so much."
FemmeThoughts,2fq9ag,SomeOldGoat,22,Sun Sep 7 16:43:47 2014 UTC,"I don't know the list of all the people are who had photos leaked. I avoided seeing any of the pictures. It didn't seem to me that people were only standing up for the white women who had photos leaked, I just think Jennifer Lawrence is a more well-known celebrity at the moment and so she was picked as the sort of ""headliner"" of that horrible misuse of private stuff."
FemmeThoughts,2fq9ag,theHerbivore,14,Mon Sep 8 00:44:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think it's directly racial.  I think it's more of a popularity thing, because I have never even heard of Jill Scott (nor did I go through the list of photos searching for celebs).  There were plenty of other celebs who never got mentioned because they aren't popular.  However, I guess you could argue that popularity and race have a lot to do with each other.  But that would be a different issue, and not really a feminists directly being racist."
FemmeThoughts,2fq9ag,radams713,3,Mon Sep 8 02:21:07 2014 UTC,"That's more my take. It says more to me about how Jill Scott's race, age, and body have made her less notable in the public eye. Although I do think Rihanna was among those who had photos leaked and that wasn't as widely addressed as Lawrence."
FemmeThoughts,2fq9ag,radams713,3,Mon Sep 8 03:37:12 2014 UTC,"If Rihanna had her account hacked and photos leaked, that would have been a better comparison.  Since they are both about the same in popularity."
FemmeThoughts,2fq9ag,hermithome,3,Mon Sep 8 03:41:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it seems strange to immediately go to Jill Scott since Rihanna is much more of a mega-star. I also wondered if the lack of discussion about Rihanna as part of the leaks was almost like...a silent judgement because she so frequently posts photos of herself very scantily clad/sexualized on Instagram as it is. Like if people weren't discussing her because in some twisted way they saw it as not as bad with regards to Rihanna because of that. Which would obviously be wrong. I don't know, it's total speculation from me!"

FemmeThoughts,2fouib,hermithome,13,Sun Sep 7 04:34:46 2014 UTC,"I'd go with 2 or 3. Or a combo. talk to the others and say that you're fed up, and considering quitting the group. You really like them, and really want to learn the language, but right now, this dude is monopolising the group saying really awful stuff and he's not even learning the language, so what's the point?  If you feel like you can organise the group, simply offer to do so, just without him. If you can't, then when you speak to the others, talk about starting your own group and see if one of them are interested in hosting or maybe you can share the duties!  I can't guarantee that the other people in the group will be up for it, but you can try. I wouldn't try the first though, because they might not be free on the day you suggest, or might try and adjust the group to your schedule.   And if the other people in the group say ""don't know what you're talking about, I'm not really interested in the language either, I just go because I like organiser and everything he says"", well, then they probably aren't people you'd want around either."

Only more diplomatic.   How does the rest of the group react when Mr Opinions starts talking? I'm sure there's at least one other person thinking ""Won't this guy shut up?""

FemmeThoughts,2fo6la,kochipoik,1 point,Sun Sep 7 06:07:08 2014 UTC,"I will definitely do that, thanks!! So if anyone else is reading, when we take general swabs (while doing a speculum), we're mainly checking for chlamydia and gonorroea, but it will usually show up thrush and bacterial vaginosis as well (the latter two are not classed as STI's). Group B strep if you're pregnant (needs antibiotics). And other weird things if they're there but I've almost never seen anything particularly weird.  If the doc has no other reason to do a speculum exam (ie you don't need a smear, or internal exam for another reason), then ""self-swabs"" are just as good - this is where you take the swab into the bathroom and put it up your own vagina. Again, tests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. NOTE not all labs can offer this though.  For men, you can do a urine test for chlamydia (because the ureter is part of both the urinal and genital system). Penis swabs are not scary, they're much much smaller than you think. And you can do it yourself.  If you have an active sore on your vulva, we can swab it for herpes. We don't check for warts - they're clinical diagnosis only, as with most vulval rashes/skin changes. Syphilis, HIV etc is best on a blood test."

Like, publicly:   However, not everyone in the subreddits besieged by trolls thinks the open letter is the best way to affect positive change.  The r/TwoXChromosomes community isn’t just the single largest and most influential subreddit dealing with women’s issues, it’s also the only one to listed as a default—meaning that everyone who visits the site sees content from it automatically on Reddit’s front page. When r/TwoXChromosomes was named as a default earlier this year, the community’s newfound prominence attracted a critical mass of misogynistic trolls.  As such, one would assume that its moderators would co-sign the the latter, but one would be wrong.  “Racism and bigotry are highly complex problems that cannot be solved with the signing of a letter, or a website policing its users, or giving the trolls a spotlight. We are patently disinterested,” subreddit co-founder HiFructoseCornFeces explained. “Growing up means realizing that combating evil does not mean spending all of your energy stamping out every last flicker of fuckery, but in issuing forth genuine goodness whole-heartedly and with resonance.”   http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/reddit-rape-racist-comment-trolls-problem/"

All of these criticisms about alienating female readers seem to be coming from everyone except actual female readers.   Edit: to clarify, this comment isn't meant to suggest that I speak for all female readers, or that other female readers can't disagree. It's more to point out that the media shit storm (""all of these criticisms"" above) usually endeavors to speak for an entire gender without bothering to explore the subject matter, and that's annoying as fuck.   I'm not suggesting that outside perspectives are inherently bad, just that there's usually more to it, and deciding that female comic fans as a subset of a subculture should be or inherently are offended is often more offensive than the shit being criticized in the first place."

It is overly sexualized and the artist even calls it an erotic image.   It's not a fair comparison as the Spider-Man image he is crouching with his legs to his side without the curvature of the back and focus on the ass. The Spiderwoman image is clearly lordosis position.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordosis_behavior  Edit:What crosses the line and overly sexualized is different for every person. For me personally this crosses the line. Should anyone tell an artist they they shouldn't draw women this way or tell marvel that they can't publish comics with covers like that?

The primary characteristics are a lowering of the forelimbs whilst keeping the rear limbs extended and hips raised, ventral arching of the spine and a raising, or sideward, displacement of the tail. During lordosis, the spine curves dorsoventrally so that the apex points towards the abdomen.

A friend of mine posted this to facebook as well and my first instinct was to temper Maddox's angry outburst; I can see why people's patiences are wearing thin while also agreeing that many are jumping this cover with about the same amount of actual warrant as the people who thought Cameron Stewart's Batgirl selfie preview was the worst possible thing.  On the other hand I don't get why people still expect better from the big two.

For me personally I find a lot of the body policing artists have when drawing superheroes is very normative in terms of big bust, huge hips, tiny waist, tall, etc. and quite often, for me, they're in sexual-esque positions. I mean, it's totally possible for a female hero to stand there and not have her bosom pushed out for maximum effect but why is it that so many images are made in this way even when there is no need for it?   And some SJW do tend to blow things up, it's how they breathe xD"

FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,Shmaesh,47,Wed Sep 3 13:59:09 2014 UTC,I'm finding the reaction of said Reddit community in regards to the rejection to be really gross. It reeks of self entitlement.
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,cordis_melum,53,Wed Sep 3 16:00:36 2014 UTC,"Seriously. And it's such a mockery. They exploited a victim's violation of privacy for their own selfish needs, then taunted her by making donations in the name of her boobs (yeah, I've seen comments of people saying they dedicated their donations to JLaw's boobs specifically) just so they could feel good about themselves.  AND to add insult to injury, they reacted to this violation of privacy that affected predominantly women by choosing a charity that only affects men. It's such a slap in the face, I can't believe anyone would try to defend it as the moral thing to do.   (disclaimer: I'm not saying PCF isn't a worthy charity, it absolutely is, but specifically choosing it was obviously meant to send a message)"
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,Leagle_Egal,43,Wed Sep 3 18:05:25 2014 UTC,"To further add insult to injury, the choice in charity is essentially a masturbation joke, namely the idea that masturbation decreases the incidence of prostate cancer. It's gross all around.   The charity itself is good, and they have freaking backbone. It's a worthy cause, but not in this way."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,cordis_melum,6,Wed Sep 3 18:15:46 2014 UTC,I have managed to avoid them! Is it just a lot of outrage regarding their attempt to paper over the shitty thing they're doing being rejected?

It's horribly tasteless, and I don't even think a lot of the redditors involved fully understand the depth of shittiness. PCF was right to refuse it."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,calliethedestroyer,67,Wed Sep 3 16:23:35 2014 UTC,"My father is a 9 year prostate cancer survivor, and all I have to say is GOOD FOR THEM. Seriously.  I know the money could have been used for great things (because let's face it, cancer sucks and money used to help find a cure or to help those who are suffering with it is great ) but no organization is going to want their name tired to that bad press.  Not to mention that some of the leaked photos were of celebs that were under 18 at the time, so not only do you have invasion of privacy but now child pornography thrown in the mix. So in my opinion they did the right thing.  No one should be pandering to these immature people who give reddit a bad image."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,Leagle_Egal,29,Wed Sep 3 15:15:49 2014 UTC,"Yup. Pretty much all this.  If people are upset that their donation was returned, they are more than welcome to redonate it under their own name.  Someone else in a different thread also made the point that it might not be a good move for a charity to accept a large donation from someone/something that had solicited those donations themselves. I don't know a lot about charities, but on the surface it makes sense that that might be iffy. (3rd party collects 60k, donates 45k to charity, keeps 15k.... lack of transparency etc etc.)"
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,sophie_hp,23,Wed Sep 3 15:46:21 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about the loss of money. First of all, reddit's contribution was around $6k ($12k with the donation-matching being done by Safeway right now). That's a drop in the bucket compared to PCF's yearly donations (in 2013, over $23 million). Besides which, they'll probably make that money back tenfold from good will and press they're getting from this. Celebrities and media bigwigs are huge sources of donations (either as donors themselves, or as spokespeople), and staying on their good side can only help their cause."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,sophie_hp,23,Wed Sep 3 18:00:18 2014 UTC,"Exactly for that, PR purposes.  For a charity, bad press means that people are going to donate to other charity, or don't donate at all, costing them much more than a mere $6k in the long run. Maybe some, but not everyone would donate to a charity that accepted money from drug lords, stormfront, the kkk, etc."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,Sigh_No_More,22,Wed Sep 3 17:14:03 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't.  If I knew a charity was accepting money from ""El Chapo"" Guzman, first thing I would think it's that it's a money laundering scheme. If I knew a charity was accepting money from Stormfront or the KKK, I would assume they are somehow a racist charity and wouldn't even be interested in finding if it's true or not. If I knew a charity was accepting money from people screaming to the world that they masturbated off stolen pictures of celebrities and underage girls, I would roll my eyes and say loudly ""seriusly?"".   After all, donating to another charity is as easy of scrolling down http://www.charitywatch.org and reputation means a lot when the list is only contains a name, a rating and a link to their website.   Most people wouldn't even know about reddit giving to the PCF   The way it's going in the media, looks like the only ones left for reporting this is CNN. I remember reading a comment in a thread in /r/cycling where someone doesn't use their Reddit jersey anymore because of a ""isn't that the website of the child molesters that was on the news?"" comment he got from another cyclist."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,18,Wed Sep 3 17:19:41 2014 UTC,"It could also be that they don't agree with how the money was raised. It wasn't just reddit in general, it was a subreddit explicitly dedicated to posting the leaked pictures. From what I understand, the donation is basically meant to be in honor of the celebrities. Not because they feel bad about what happened, but because they are enjoying it. Some people were even talking about wishing they could use the money to buy more pictures.   The whole thing is just disgusting, and I think it's completely fair for any organization to decide they don't want to be associated with it in any way."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,Sigh_No_More,17,Wed Sep 3 17:34:06 2014 UTC,"It's nothing more than the guilty fappers of Reddit trying to assuage their consciences by purchasing an indulgence.  I haven't been following their side of things so I don't know the rationale behind their choice of charity, but I consider it in exceptionally poor taste that they selected to combat a form of cancer which predominantly only affects men.  It's like committing a crime against Jews and then atoning for it by giving money to Catholics.  I absolutely agree with the foundation's refusal to be used in this fashion.  Anything that throws a spanner into this sick worldview that people are objects to be used -- these ones are put there to make my weenie hard, those ones are put there to make my ego feel better -- without respect for their own agency or determination is a good thing in my book."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,cordis_melum,11,Wed Sep 3 17:45:17 2014 UTC,"Yes, that is definitely a part of it too! While I fully support prostate cancer research and would applaud people who donate in any other circumstances, this is the exception. I would feel the same way if they were donating to breast cancer research instead. The intent behind it just invalidates all of the good will.   I would be 110% okay with it if it were people who are against the pictures and either never looked or sincerely regret looking, and they were donating to a charity focused on sexual assault/violence (and now that I think of it, I might actually do that). But that's pretty much the opposite of what's happening here."

Now they receive their regular donations (and some regulars might throw in an extra few dollars to say, ""hey thanks for standing up for morals""), PLUS the bump that people who are riled up will provide. I bet even some people from reddit feel strongly enough to go out of their way and donate under their real names/non reddit names. I don't think it's shortsighted at all. They are pairing their company and their charity with a certain moral viewpoint and they are attracting people with this viewpoint."

Jennifer's lawyer's are threatening to sue anyone in possession of them - which right now includes reddit servers.  It's fucking disgusting.  I looked in (only at the comments, none of the pictures) and they are all patting themselves on the back for communally deciding to stop posting pics they know to be underage.  Well lah dee dah."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,EnergyCritic,7,Thu Sep 4 04:35:25 2014 UTC,Gotta draw the line somewhere.  That line of course having nothing whatsoever to do with morality and everything to do with potentially getting sent to jail.  I'm hoping everyone who saw the underage pictures got a major wake-up call.

Also I find it hilarious when people in The Fappening say things like ""you think Jennifer Lawrence is more important than prostate cancer/clean water/insert charity cause here.""  They raised 6K.  That is not going to magically cure cancer.  Someone over at SRD pointed out that that is about enough to cover the cost of a PCR machine.  The Fappening compares supporting Jennifer Lawrence to supporting cancer when it's more akin to comparing Jennifer Lawrence's titties to a PCR machine."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,ecib,12,Wed Sep 3 23:36:30 2014 UTC,"Oh, so you think donating money to prostate cancer will placate your critics? Or is it just done in irony? Either way -- disgusting.  In fact, it straight up acknowledges the very serious corruption behind the non-profit system where people can give money to an organization in order to justify their actions.  It's an entirely different subject, but I can't help but feel like this will open the door for similarly ""malicious"" fundraising."

Or were those just all immature empty threats before? I usually roll my eyes and tend to not pay attention to this kind of crap but since this is one of the charities I actually donate to, the news came up in my feed this morning and I (sadly) saw the whining thread on the front page early on where there were some people complaining about it."
FemmeThoughts,2fcuqk,meldolphin,6,Wed Sep 3 20:54:40 2014 UTC,"4chan's done all sorts of weird things, some innocuous and others not.  They raided a poll contest that chose which school got a concert from Taylor Swift and it ended up being a school for the deaf.  Which is short-sighted anyway because there's plenty of deaf people who enjoy music.  They also did one that chose Kodiak Alaska as the location for a Pitbull concert and surprisingly enough, he delivered.  Kind of a ""fuck you"" and apparently it was an awesome time for everyone."

There's nothing wrong with aspiring to be a certain kind of performer, even if it's very different from what you are today, unless your reasoning is based on hate.   It's hard to figure that out sometimes. The messages we've internalized aren't conscious efforts.   This can be very liberating though! Now you can ask yourself why you perform certain ways. It's a chance to learn what makes you happy, or what is pointless or toxic baggage that you don't need to worry about anymore. Then your performance can be less about hidden anxiety and more about happiness and self-fulfillment.  Part of your performance is choosing how much ""self"" you will sacrifice to be ""social."" If people can't handle your passion, and passion is important to you, forget those people and find your peers."

There are tons of ways women behave that are or are not typically feminine, and all of them are ok. Really. Being emotional is not a handicap. Discounting emotion is a glaring fallacy in many peoples' logic. Emotional reasoning and experience is real and to ignore it is to ignore a huge portion of human experience.  Plus, Mulder and Booth are stereotypically feminine in a number of ways and no one gets down on them for thinking with their emotions or being illogical."

I wish there were female characters I could look at who didn't stay cool and dispassionate and scientifically rational at all times but were still respected for their insight and moxie.

But OP (my bad, you are OP, sorry) could probably use some positive examples of people exhibiting stereotypical feminine behavior to help back up that there's nothing inherently wrong with said behaviors.   I wish there were female characters I could look at who didn't stay cool and dispassionate and scientifically rational at all times but were still respected for their insight and moxie   One of the things I'm noticing about Scully this time through is that she regularly gets shrill and often yells and no one bats an eye or tries to calm her down. She's also prone to throwing all of her dispassionate logic out the window as soon as it's a religious episode.   I recommended these things because the women in them display a nice mix of feminine and less feminine traits.  Your points are absolutely good, though. It's virtually impossible to find women who show feminine traits who aren't demonized. I really enjoyed the first two seasons of American Horror Story for this reason (I haven't seen the third yet, so I can't comment. But I'm excited for it!) and should have mentioned it as well."

FemmeThoughts,2fbn6x,sothatshowyougetants,1 point,Thu Sep 4 10:59:20 2014 UTC,"However, when I speak about anything passionately, I tend to be more voluble and bombastic in my delivery, and I have often had a perfectly valid argument dismissed simply because of the way I've made it.   I am male and when I get passionate and louder usually the opposite happens. In these situations I am more afraid of being too dominant with my opinion... This unequal treatment is so sad and makes me angry :( (passionate women = crazy / passionate men = they know what they want)  I observed this in myself (so you may feel completely different): when I police my behavior it's often related to disrespecting a certain behavior in others that I don't want to show. When it's about a real issue (like male gazing) this is ok, but when it's about stigmatized behavior that should be totally normal (e.g. tearing up) it's dangerous and unhealthy, because I may look down on others who do that. People feel this and I guess this is how the stigma is perpetuated.  The crux in your situation is that you either get dismissed or betray your own feelings. I think this is a rather typical problem especially for women. The getting dismissed part is really oppressive :(  I don't know what to do. I think awareness and actively trying to appreciate femininity not as something ""lesser than"" is always good... Maybe you can even change the outcome of your passionate speeches when you are not afraid of being perceived as a hysterical and illogical woman (I think this stereotype is really a malicious oppressive myth). While there are probably many people who dismiss it as a reflex there might be also people who feel your insecurity in these situations. At least the latter might take you serious when you believe in yourself. But I really don't know how to do this it might just introduce more double binds and pressure :/  Maybe you like these two nice short blog entries by Nerdy Feminist:  Will we ever stop the cultural association between femininity and ""lesser than?""

FemmeThoughts,2fabsr,silliestsloth,3,Tue Sep 2 19:33:05 2014 UTC,"This sounds like they're including both transmen and transwomen - hurray!  My only minor concern is the combination of these two facts from the FAQ:   Will Mount Holyoke College require any statement beyond an applicant’s gender self-identification?  No.   combined with:    If a transwoman decides, during her four years as a Mount Holyoke student, to change her mind and chooses a male gender identity, will she need to withdraw from the College?  No. Once students are admitted, the College supports them regardless of their sex or gender identity, which is consistent with our current practice.   Now, I know WHY the answers to these questions are the way they are, and props to Mt. Holyoke for being so inclusive. But if someone wanted to ""game the system"" as it were, couldn't a man apply, claim that he is a transwoman (when he knows he's not), then after freshman year declare a changed mind? I mean, the odds of this happening are practically zero, but if a cisman wanted to go to an all-female school, he would be able to do this at Mt. Holyoke.  I mean, there's really no way around this; you can't be completely inclusive without running this risk (asking applicants to prove they are trans is not acceptable; a transwoman may have been hiding her identification because of a dangerous homelife etc etc). I just hope no one tries to take advantage of this policy."
FemmeThoughts,2fabsr,octobereighth,8,Tue Sep 2 22:26:12 2014 UTC,"The very slight risk that somebody might abuse this policy to perpetrate a fraud is very much outweighed by the good the policy promotes.  I think it's kind of repulsive to focus on very low-probability fraud rather than celebrate the inclusivity, honestly.  Also I'm not sure the college itself realizes this, but if they're admitting transmen it's no longer an all-female school already."

At the same time, I'm obviously blind to the reasons why a trans man would want to attend women's college, and I honestly haven't heard any perspectives from trans men themselves. I know many trans people come out or come to terms with their identity during college, and it would be cruel for a college to kick a man out for identifying that way.   I guess part of it is what does it mean for a women's college to be a women's college?"
FemmeThoughts,2fabsr,girlwithblanktattoo,1 point,Thu Sep 4 01:05:57 2014 UTC,"In r/feminism posters were pointing out that a fair number of people begin transition at college - so you might apply and enter presenting as female but then transition to male.  If this happens, they don't kick you out."
FemmeThoughts,2fabsr,webquean,2,Tue Sep 9 18:16:15 2014 UTC,"I guess you would have to wonder why a cisman would want to do that at all -- but given that the idea of safety and sanctity of the female space is such a big part of the women's college experience (particularly for really religious women, for whom women's college may be the only education option), it's a possible concern. I guess then you're prioritizing a hypothetical over real rights, though.   Can you explain for me the reasoning behind transmen at women's college? It's beyond my realm of understanding and I'm thankful that I've been able to learn enough to realize that this is a blind spot due to my own privilege so I stop going around embarrassing myself saying ""SUCH A WEIRD IDEA! THEY THINK THEY'RE MEN, Y THEY GO TO WOMEN'S COLLEGE?!"" I'm embarrassed by past me :("
FemmeThoughts,2fabsr,Flutterella,3,Tue Sep 2 22:31:43 2014 UTC,"I'm coming from a place of privilege on this as well, but my guess is that it's similar to Michfest's reasoning: they've been socialized, raised, and nurtured as women, so they share a specific quality of womanness with cis and trans* women that cis men don't."
FemmeThoughts,2fabsr,webquean,2,Tue Sep 2 22:47:50 2014 UTC,"Trans men are still men though, a privileged group. And many many of them are misogynists. Them being assigned female doesn't suddenly make them not men or men lite."
FemmeThoughts,2fabsr,CrushdTinBox,1 point,Wed Sep 10 16:26:03 2014 UTC,"I agree on that point and I don't think men have a place in a women's college, but I also don't believe many men are going to attend a women's college in the first place. From what I've gathered, it's to protect men who come out in college and begin transitioning while at Mt. Holyhoke from being expelled or forced out."

There's a long history surrounding it, but these days the official policy is to just let transwomen as a sacrifice to keep the festival alive and running.  It's true that Michfest allows transmen in due to socialization, but that same argument has been used by people to try and get transwomen removed from the festival. So... I wouldn't be using them as a good example if we're talking about trans-accepting places."

I don't know if this applies to Lawrence as much because I think she was already in her 20s by the time she was famous, but I remember when the Olsen twins turned 18 and there were a lot of dudes ""jokingly"" counting down the days until they were legal. I see people on the internet doing the same thing now with that girl who plays Sansa Stark, but now it's mixed with ""soon we'll get to see her boobs too"" and it just grosses me out. There's this weird feeling that dudes NEED to see nude celebrities by any means necessary. The tone is like they're owed it. It's always so gross. It makes me so, so angry."

Or ""who cares, you know how many people would want your life/bank account?"" Like any of these are justifications.  Homestly, the sheer sense of ENTITLEMENT these guys have in regards to ogling these women's bodies is extremely disturbing.  The reaction threads I've read are so pathetic. Reddit is so full of crap when it comes to their wah surveillance is bad b b b but wat about my privacyyyy?!"

Girls have to get naked though! I mean, girls aren't self conscious about their bodies at all right!? Horrid."

FemmeThoughts,2f4c11,SomeOldGoat,12,Mon Sep 1 04:11:20 2014 UTC,"Maybe the invasion of privacy is part of the thrill? And because they aren't shooped, they can somehow convince themselves that the photos were for them."

FemmeThoughts,2f4c11,SomeOldGoat,-16,Mon Sep 1 09:26:20 2014 UTC,"It's definitely primarily curiosity.  Many of these women have been sold as sex symbols by the media/movie producers. It then only becomes natural that people might wonder what's under the clothing.  The fact that they're being released illegally also adds some interest to the story, though, as the photos will likely be removed from most image hosting sites. So right now they're expected to become rare, and as such valuable.  And remember - it isn't only men looking and enjoying these images. I'm male, but a female co-worker of mine, and my significant other, both made mention of Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos today.  Edit: I made a positive contribution to the discussion, but of course, because I dared to have an alternate point of view, I got downvoted. If you want real discussion (assuming that's the goal here, not just mindlessly agreeing with each other), you as a community need to be open to differing opinions."

FemmeThoughts,2f4c11,SomeOldGoat,2,Tue Sep 2 19:45:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I mean...there's a huge chasm of difference if I say to myself ""man, I think Michael Fassbender is hot, I'd like to see him naked"" and then google pictures of his dong in Shame or if instead of that I think ""I bet at one point he's taken dick pics for a girlfriend, I'd like to see those"". I mean...I'm pretty generally creeped out by the weird publicness of celebrations around any celebrity (usually female) choosing to nude it up on screen, regardless of context (see: looking up Michael Fassbender's dong in the context of Shame, a super-upsetting movie or say...dudes drooling over Scarlett Johanssen in Under the Skin, a movie the seems to pretty explicitly critique objectification and the male gaze)/people posting about a hot celebrity essentially saying ""I'm going to JO to this person later,"" but there's nothing inherently line-crossing about that.

There could be criminal laws involved here beyond the hacking, and she also could sue any site that makes money through use of the pictures. She could have recourse."

There's no way removing your bra would be required. Men would just remove their top for convenience but leaving your bra on should've been convenient enough. If this was a clinic outside work then you should be able to complain  about this without damaging your career. Maybe you deal with so much sexism at work it's hard for you to see how out of order this is from a doctor. It's not a molehill, it's pretty damn sick and you have every right to feel sick about it.

Its the having to strip to my underwear for second part of the medical that I just don't get. Like, really, I don't understand why that level of nudity was necessary.  Its weird. And gross.  Ours is a very small industry. He's not directly affliated with work, but knows people that I have to work with- he'll know pretty much every other doctor in the country thats qualified to give this kind of medical.

Ditto for bruising, petechiae, and other skin abnormalities.   When he listened to your lungs, he should have been looking to see if your chest expanded symmetrically or not, and whether you had intercostal retractions.  When we examine patients, we may be observing things that you don't know we're looking at.  You got a more thorough exam then if you'd been examined through your clothes.  However, it's common practice to give you a gown so that you have a little shred of dignity left, and then just move the gown out of the way to see your back or chest or belly at the appropriate time."
FemmeThoughts,2ezxpy,Munchkinme1,10,Sun Aug 31 01:37:32 2014 UTC,"Is the doctor in any way affiliated with your place of work? I would guess the places that perform physicals aren't. I would try and register some sort of complaint with the clinic. I don't think that would get back to your company at all. Plus it's one think to deal with sexism in the oilfield, it is another entirely to have someone in a medical position of power have you take off your clothes. That's just bullshit. if it were me, I woukd feel like it is an entirely different type of violation because it is a physical violation."
FemmeThoughts,2ezxpy,Munchkinme1,5,Sat Aug 30 12:32:20 2014 UTC,"He's not directly affiliated, no. But it's a small industry so he'll know the medics that I work with offshore and he'll have examined plenty of people that I work with. He'll also know pretty much every other Doctor who holds the qualification to conduct this type of medical.  Word gets around, it would be my word against his. I raised no questions about having to get undressed at the time. I don't have a leg to stand on. I also don't want to work myself into a situation where I have to leave the county to get a medical, because no doctor will see me for fear of a complaint.   I feel so powerless.  It is fucking bullshit.  Yeah the medical violation is a deeper kind than some dickbag just trying to put his hand up my skirt. I think its just because I know not to trust the dickbag from the get go, but with a Doctor - trust them from the outset. I've never had a reason not to trust them."

I once had a conversation take place in my range of hearing but that I did hear since I wasn't paying attention.  I do however know it was not a good conversation because one of the guys who'd been standing in the area came over to me almost immediately and sincerely apoligized, saying he doesn't like that kind of talk and hopes I didn't feel uncomfortable because he sure did. Another time a guy was calling me bitchy behind my back just for doing my job properly. Another guy stepped in and stood up for me. I just think there's a difference between toeing the line and crossing it. And I'm a little overly huffy about this stuff because I deal with it every day and I feel annoyed on your behalf."

The suggestion is to contact the clinic about it and explain my experience. So I am doing to do that when I've calmed down.  I only get called a bitch when I'm asking someone to do something within their job description. I also get told I'm nagging if I have to repeat myself, which I will do when I've asked someone to do something and then find out they've not done it. Mostly because I'm in a supervisory position and, well, thats my job. It used to bother me but I've become increasingly hard-nosed about it, now my response is ""You can do it. I can nag you or I can run you off. You realise I've only got total control over two of those options and one of them isn't working, right? ""  Oddly, when I'm asking someone to go above and beyond - they do it first time and are generally really happy to help. Its good to have options in a pinch, I suppose."

FemmeThoughts,2f0ab8,coffeejeong,13,Sat Aug 30 14:43:30 2014 UTC,"So right of the bat, this article annoys me a little. First the talk about people dying young in earlier times. For one, people married earlier (even in the last few decades people are marrying later in the US). And also even though the average lifespan was shorter, this is because of the high infant and child mortality rate. Once someone got past 20, they were most likely to live a long and healthy life. Yeah, diseases that we've somewhat eradicated were major death causes, but we've got our own 21st century diseases (i.e. heart disease) that pick off relatively young people in this day and age too.  Then the ""most marriages end in divorce"" statistic that makes me grind my teeth. This is one of those technically correct stats that gets thrown around. Yes, most marriages end in divorce, but this is all marriages, including second, third, fourth, and etc. Most first marriages do not end in divorce. But people who divorce once are much more likely to divorce on their next marriage, statistically.   So, I don't know, to start the article out with this cry of, ""but long term relationships are so archaic, they're a remnant from an earlier time! We're different now! We're not made to be together for so long!"" But to be relying on facts that are more like misinterpreted statistics is bothersome to me."

FemmeThoughts,2ew1kg,MarbleNarwhal,2,Fri Aug 29 21:58:20 2014 UTC,"Rave: I started working at my university's main kitchen/grill restaurant yesterday, and was told I would have the opportunity to possibly learn how to cook line and make food on the grill. I've worked in customer service for almost 5 years and I've NEVER cooked anything--it's all been cash register, serving, dishes, and food prep (like chopping veggies). Often I get the feeling that it's gone this way because I'm a girl, and I frequently have felt overlooked because of my gender. If a manager wants to train someone to do something new, I feel like 9 times out of 10 they'll choose a male, for whatever reason, over an equally qualified woman. If that makes sense.   Kitchens are usually male dominated in my experience (I worked at a McDonald's as a teen that exclusively hired women to work the tills and men to cook the food), so I was nervous about being in that environment at my new job, where, again, most of the senior staff are male.   WELL. Today I had my first shift in the ""dish pit,"" which was a breeze (I've washed a lot of dishes in my day), and almost right away the cook came up to me and asked if I had any food prep experience. He was really friendly (as is everyone I've worked with so far) and recognized that I've put in lots of time in the food service industry in general. He basically said that he wanted to get me on line ASAP because even though there's a lot to learn he was sure I could handle it. Unfortunately I ended up being needed on the till over at the grill restaurant (there's two, kind of--it's confusing) and didn't get the chance today. But hopefully when I work a full dishwashing shift I'll be able to start helping out on the food side of things!!  Even though working on till is kind of boring (I feel like a monkey could do it) and being a dish bitch is hard, wet, and messy (heh) I've felt really comfortable around all of my coworkers. I don't get the sense that this is a workplace where the bosses automatically delegate the hard/challenging work to the boys--everyone has treated me respectfully and as a capable employee. I have a feeling this has to do with the fact that 95% of the employees here are students around my age, so there's not that weird generational sexism. Not to mention the fact that my university is a fairly left wing establishment in a VERY left wing town. Whatever the case, it's really nice!  So, it may be a crappy student job in a greasy pub kitchen, but for now I'm pretty happy with it. And I'm really excited to (hopefully) actually cook (then I'd get about $2 more per hour, too)!!"

FemmeThoughts,2etkb3,MarthaGail,3,Thu Aug 28 17:09:19 2014 UTC,"I didn't see your OP at the time, but ugh. I've been there so much, particularly with the pelvic stuff. In fact, I'm probably going to be pursuing an MPH because of this bullshit -- I was stuck in the medical rabbit hole for I think 3 years, but I'm not cured yet, so who knows.  So few people believe that women should be allowed a pain-free existence. It's one of the worst things I've come to realize. It's not until I get ANGRY that I get proper medical care -- what kind of system is this? Doctors who are renowned across the nation don't give me the time of day because they assume I'm not empowered enough to question it; they can save their energy for someone else. It's so messed up. It's easier to tell us that we're not trying to live pain-free enough, that we're making it up, that somehow this is OUR fault.   I don't get it. I don't know how the healthcare system so fundamentally fails women time after time. All I know is that when I finally got my correct diagnosis, after years and years of shaming and bad medicine, it took 15 seconds. 15 fucking seconds. Just one finger up there to find the spastic muscle and boom. That was it. It was so easy. Just...no one else knew, cared, or thought to do it before.   I'm really glad you made it out of the rabbit hole and, god I wish this term hadn't been coopted, you've taken the medical red pill so to speak. Now that you know how to be a self-advocate, you can start getting the best care you can. Good luck to you, from one young angry chronic pain lady to another :) it DOES get better from here, I promise!"

It does seem to be a trend that women are assumed to have more emotional difficulty with health and that a state of pain is almost normal (what with pregnancy and menstruation being ""normal"" kinds of pain). I am hoping the pelvic pain clinic can provide some answers since they do a lot of research. Previously, I felt like I was just being put on an endless stream of drugs with the hope that one of them will work. No exams in between drugs, all of this was done over the phone through a nurse taking notes so who knows what was said. That was not good. How did you eventually find someone to diagnose you?"

But I can say that I have very pale skin and very dark and profuse body hair. I was essentially brow-beaten by family members into beginning to shave when I was eleven because of how hairy I was and how obvious it was. I remember in junior high seeing a a Black girl wearing a tank top even with armpit hair and being very impressed by how much of a nonissue it seemed to her. (My junior high was 80% Black, as was my elementary school, so wanting to be more like the Black girls was actually a common thing for me.)  I've noticed, though, that even among women who choose not to shave, it is far more common for women with less-noticeable hair. I haven't shaved my armpits since 2007, and I shave my legs maybe once a year (and I don't hide my legs, either), but I don't know anyone else who is as obviously hairy as I am who doesn't. I have no rules either way with my daughters, though my 12-year-old has been made to shave her armpits by my ex-husband's girlfriend as a condition of wearing a sleeveless shirt. But she has golden skin and light-colored leg hair, and I am well aware that this will make it much easier for her to stay hairy if she wants to."

FemmeThoughts,2ehais,dedededede,2,Mon Aug 25 15:54:31 2014 UTC,"Transcript of this video begins at paragraph #3 here.  See below also:  'I want to take this opportunity to talk about beauty. Black beauty. Dark beauty. I received a letter from a girl and I’d like to share just a small part of it with you: ""Dear Lupita,"" it reads, ""I think you’re really lucky to be this Black but yet this successful in Hollywood overnight. I was just about to buy Dencia’s Whitenicious cream to lighten my skin when you appeared on the world map and saved me.""  My heart bled a little when I read those words. I could never have guessed that my first job out of school would be so powerful in and of itself and that it would propel me to be such an image of hope in the same way that the women of The Color Purple were to me.   I remember a time when I too felt unbeautiful. I put on the TV and only saw pale skin. I got teased and taunted about my night-shaded skin. And my one prayer to God, the miracle worker, was that I would wake up lighter-skinned. The morning would come and I would be so excited about seeing my new skin that I would refuse to look down at myself until I was in front of a mirror because I wanted to see my fair face first. And every day I experienced the same disappointment of being just as dark as I had been the day before. I tried to negotiate with God: I told him I would stop stealing sugar cubes at night if he gave me what I wanted; I would listen to my mother's every word and never lose my school sweater again if he just made me a little lighter. But I guess God was unimpressed with my bargaining chips because He never listened.   And when I was a teenager my self-hate grew worse, as you can imagine happens with adolescence. My mother reminded me often that she thought that I was beautiful but that was no consolation: She’s my mother, of course she’s supposed to think I am beautiful. And then Alek Wek came on the international scene. A celebrated model, she was dark as night, she was on all of the runways and in every magazine and everyone was talking about how beautiful she was. Even Oprah called her beautiful and that made it a fact. I couldn’t believe that people were embracing a woman who looked so much like me as beautiful. My complexion had always been an obstacle to overcome and all of a sudden, Oprah was telling me it wasn’t. It was perplexing and I wanted to reject it because I had begun to enjoy the seduction of inadequacy. But a flower couldn’t help but bloom inside of me. When I saw Alek I inadvertently saw a reflection of myself that I could not deny. Now, I had a spring in my step because I felt more seen, more appreciated by the far away gatekeepers of beauty, but around me the preference for light skin prevailed. To the beholders that I thought mattered, I was still unbeautiful. And my mother again would say to me, ""You can’t eat beauty. It doesn’t feed you."" And these words plagued and bothered me; I didn’t really understand them until finally I realized that beauty was not a thing that I could acquire or consume, it was something that I just had to be.   And what my mother meant when she said you can’t eat beauty was that you can’t rely on how you look to sustain you. What does sustain us... what is fundamentally beautiful is compassion for yourself and for those around you. That kind of beauty enflames the heart and enchants the soul. It is what got Patsey in so much trouble with her master, but it is also what has kept her story alive to this day. We remember the beauty of her spirit even after the beauty of her body has faded away.   And so I hope that my presence on your screens and in the magazines may lead you, young girl, on a similar journey. That you will feel the validation of your external beauty but also get to the deeper business of being beautiful inside. There is no shade in that beauty.'"

Forget other struggles women endure or how not every women can land a date or some intimate fun.   I think men who say this forget their success in other areas of their life, but when they struggle in the dating world, every privilege or accomplishment they have and made escape them - and they focus solely on sex and romance. When that happens, they resort to the view that women have it great....based off one area in life."

An argument I tend to use when I come up against this is to point out the logical inconsistency in their argument: ""so, would you only support the work of Malala Yousafzai in advocating for girls' rights to education if she called herself a humanist rather than a feminist?"". The point about this argument is that it is completely logically inconsistent; if you are arguing that the main problem with feminism is its name, and therefore all the good it has done is invalid, then that literally makes no sense. Let's face it, most of the people who make this argument would not suddenly support feminist goals (such as eliminating the wage gap etc.) if it was a group calling themselves egalitarians advocating for these things, despite the fact that eliminating the wage gap would be consistent with egalitarian principles.

You can downvote posts to your liking because otherwise how would you be able to shape the front page?  It's supposed to be (in theory) a democracy.  For the comments it is different.  In the comments section you shouldn't downvote just because you do not agree or do not like what someone said.  You also shouldn't upvote yourself using multiple alt accounts *cough cough*

I see it as pathetic when women do it too. There's a time and place for these things, like gonewild or ladyboners.

I agree with you though, it's incredibly frustrating. Hell, I am super skinny with my ribs showing and I feel like all you hear is that too-skinny chicks are disgusting and they should all go eat a cheeseburger.

Too short? Aww, you're cute and we'll never take anything you say seriously. Too skinny? Eat some fucking food. Too fat? Fuck you for not making my penis bigger, you're lazy, eat less you cow.  (I don't believe any of the above, I'm just pointing out what reddit seems to default to a lot.)  Why are we cruel to others? Often it's to offset or cover some deep-seated pain of our own.

I think the answer here is perhaps not to attempt to debate, because I doubt that the issues are actually anti-feminism or anti-SJ, or even homophobia. I think the issue is likely the very first sentence: his mental health. It sounds like he's in a very dark place and, as you say, is struggling with empathy. He likely is subscribing to a very every-man-for-himself ideology to go along with that; if he feels little empathy, why should he support any cause that takes away any of his precious privilege?   I suggest attempting a conversation with him about how the expression of his views make you feel and how you feel they reflect on him. Explain that you're concerned about him and that his sympathizing with hateful people like the Duck Dynasty guys make you concerned that he is losing touch with people outside himself. Obviously, you can't cure his depression, but you can at the very least request that he keep these issues to himself when you're around -- he needs to understand that in expressing his anti-feminism, he is oppressing you in your own home. But I'd steer clear of making it overly political. I think this is really a matter of his own well-being, not who's right and who's wrong. He's getting mixed up with increasingly anti-social ideologies. Bring it up to your parents as well (maybe talk to them first) -- tell them what's up, why it bothers you personally, and why you're concerned.  He's your brother and he needs support right now, which you can give by refusing to indulge his heading down a dark path. In the meantime, your parents can help set up some boundaries to help you not live in total misery if he's trying to spout this stuff all the time.  Good luck to you and your family."

I feel like it's particularly nitpicky. Even for se."
FemmeThoughts,2drjby,hermithome,8,Sun Aug 17 01:02:38 2014 UTC,"Okay so correct me is I'm wrong, but my take away from this article is that because it doesn't happen as often or isn't as systematically ingrained into cultures that the objectification of men isn't nearly as important of an issue as that of women. That it should be ignored since it isn't so common because it detracts attention away from female objectification."
FemmeThoughts,2drjby,UrbanRenegade19,-1,Sun Aug 17 06:05:05 2014 UTC,"That it should be ignored   Hmm, that's not what I took away from the piece. My takeaway was that objectification of men is different than objectification of women, and not really comparable. And that while the latter is a serious issue, the former isn't really, because it's just not at all similar."
FemmeThoughts,2drjby,UrbanRenegade19,6,Sun Aug 17 08:16:29 2014 UTC,"Perhaps ""ignored"" is too strong of a word. Maybe ""given less attention"" is a more appropriate way of phrasing it. Still I don't think the core issues between the two types of objectification are as different as the author made them out to be. Even though the objectification of women is fair more ingrained into society, the end result is much the same. To me the differences between the two are like the differences between a forest fire and house fire, both burn and cause damage. And even though one rampages while the other is isolated they must both be faced and extinguished in similar ways.    Granted that injustices specifically targeting women are far more common(at least in my experience) that doesn't mean that those targeting men should be thrown by the wayside because they are less frequent.    After rereading the article, I think the author was trying to say that while the objectification of men does occur, the actions taken to correct that should be proportionate to its frequency. That's an ideology I can agree with, but the way the article was written it felt like the author was downplaying the severity and frequency of male objectification than it really is. I could be looking into things too much though. Nobody wants to feel marginalized and I may have some biases to overcome in that regard.   I apologize if I sound standoffish. Its rather difficult to convey tone via text. Thank you for  responding though."

The author wrote at length, explaining the multiple ways in which they were different. Great, you disagree, and in metaphor form, but I have no idea why you disagree.

FemmeThoughts,2drjby,LivingDeadInside,11,Sun Aug 17 09:29:13 2014 UTC,"I feel like you're bullying UrbanRenegade19 and I don't actually know why. I'm not sure if they're a he or a she - it doesn't matter. I can completely understand what the point they're trying to make is. They were polite and even apologised if their point wasn't clear. You were not.   Instead of trying to engage them in a constructive discussion, you're basically telling them that they're not making any sense because their metaphor and line of thinking does not align with yours. Then, in your capacity as a moderator, you threaten them with the subreddit rules, which, by the way, they haven't broken.   I agree with UrbanRenegade19. The article does downplay the issue of the objectification of men. The metaphor of the fire makes perfect sense. House fires can usually be contained and won't destroyed hundreds of hectares of land, whereas forest fires can rapidly become out of control and spread for hundreds of miles. It doesn't mean that we should use a bucket on the house fire and reserve our fire-fighting capacity for just the big fires. Both types of fires should be taken seriously and need water. I thought the metaphor was pretty self-explanatory.  I take the point the article makes - the objectification of women is woven into the very fabrics of our communities. However, this does not mean we should downplay the effect it has on men. Men have to deal with it. I've seen it with my very own eyes and it's just as disgusting, however, most men AND women seem to turn a blind eye to it, or in the very least, not pay as much attention. A man who complains about being sexually objectified by his female boss is more likely to be laughed at and not taken seriously. Only a massive jerk would ignore a woman who suffered the same treatment."

FemmeThoughts,2drjby,cordis_melum,0,Sun Aug 17 12:34:38 2014 UTC,"I like the way the mods act here. In my experience in many message boards where you talk about systemic oppression many people casually walk by and drop uninformed misgivings with no motivation to learn (before or after posting) or to at least empathize. They usually leave only their doubts.  I am not a very active redditor, but across reddit and many other message boards, I haven't seen anybody who brought doubt at first and who then really (verbally) acknowledged something a feminist wrote. It really feels like most doubts come from people who just want to reassure their own set in stone opinions and not the other way around.  PS: I don't want to imply that the author of the comment in this case is not a feminist or wanted to  reassure their opinions with their criticism. I just really like a more strict moderation, even if it sometimes might hit ""innocents""."

FemmeThoughts,2drjby,unveiledthought,4,Sun Aug 17 16:52:52 2014 UTC,"Speaking as a user, and not as a moderator...  The article isn't saying that we shouldn't give a shit about the sexual objectification about men. Rather, it's saying that while objectification is a problem, it does not hold the same meaning as objectification of women does, as the societal context is different. ""Man candy"" is bad, because men should not be seen solely as sexual objects. But it does not hold the same meaning in regards to reinforcing a gender hierarchy the way that, say, PETA adverts and covers of Maxim do.  In fact, the article emphasizes that on a micro, personal level, sexual objectification of men is a problem. But it further states that even though this is a case, it does not hold the same meaning on a macro scale as objectification of women does."
FemmeThoughts,2drjby,unveiledthought,5,Sun Aug 17 16:29:09 2014 UTC,"A man who complains about being sexually objectified by his female boss is more likely to be laughed at and not taken seriously.   He's not taken seriously because in patriarchy men should be powerful. And when it's about sexual desire in patriarchy they will tell him he should embrace these desires... -.-   Only a massive jerk would ignore a woman who suffered the same treatment.   This happens very often and is ignored because in patriarchy it's normal to objectify women. Any poster advertisement with a woman on it can tell you that.  It's totally not like a fire to stop. It's oppression with some disadvantages for men (and many advantages). It's far more important to change the situation for the oppressed, because if the oppression stops, the disadvantages for the oppressors vanish too."

FemmeThoughts,2drjby,dedededede,3,Sun Aug 17 11:24:04 2014 UTC,"I've poked the other mods, since clearly, I should not be the mod to weigh in here.  But to clarify my earlier warning: you can disagree with the article. I love great discussion and that's what I'd like to see. And there's tonnes you can disagree with. Maybe you disagree with the definition of objectification that the author uses. Maybe you take issue with any of the multiple ways the author explained that objectification of men and women are different.   UrbanRenegade said they didn't think the male and female objectification were that different and thought that the results were ""much the same"" and thought that the author was ""downplaying the severity and frequency of male objectification"", and stated that they felt ""marginalized.  And had they given any concrete reason for any of that, that would have been fine. Had I heard any specific disagreement, that would have been something. But there was no concrete disagreement, and I was left with a comment that's problematic.  One its one, its not that bad. As I said, it's borderline. But there's a repeated problem in women's communities with men commenting in a manner where they mostly ignore the article or post and just state that they disagree (no real reasons why) and that X problem is pretty equal between men and women and by saying otherwise, you're marginalising men.  And that's why I left a distinguished comment. UrbanRenegade didn't cross the line, but they came close. And one of the ways we keep this subreddit on track is by leaving distinguished comments frequently, reminding people of our rules and guidelines.  As for your comment, well, you confuse objectification and sexual harassment, I'm not sure why. And you seem to think that women who face sexual harassment are taken seriously, when in fact, often they aren't. In fact, they're frequently told that it isn't a big deal or that they should be flattered. And as for the fire analogy? No, it's not appropriate. The author spends several paragraphs providing concrete reasons that male and female objectification are incredibly different. Your fire analogy ignores all that and makes it an issue of size (one problem is larger/more frequent then the other). If you're going to disagree with the author's entire premise (that objectification is different in a variety of ways), you need to actually do that and say why.   Pretending that this is only an issue of size is ignoring the author's entire premise and the majority of the article.  So yes, you should feel free to disagree and discuss. But that requires discussing what the author actually said, and not just nebulous metaphors that have at their base, a dismissal of the author's entire argument. You need to be respectful. Acknowledge what the author said and explain why you disagree, don't ignore their entire point. That's rude and an excellent way to derail.   Again, I've forwarded this to the other mods, and I'll wait to see if any chose to comment, but it might take a bit."

FemmeThoughts,2dq53y,Buffalo__Buffalo,8,Sun Aug 17 13:01:07 2014 UTC,"I always feel so conflicted about this approach - for one as a male feminist, I think it's crucial in addressing other issues of gender (and other victims of patriarchy) but then I struggle with the masculinization of concepts to make them permissible for men.  I'm pretty radical in my politics, so I'm normally the first one to cry out ""Burn it to the ground!!"", which would go a long way to explain my mixed feelings... but on the other hand I feel like we as a culture need to tackle the idea of traditional (and especially hegemonic) masculinity and then it will work better; making it okay to cry rather than calling them ""man-tears"" (okay, bad example) is going to be better for everyone in the long run. (That's not to say I don't think this work is important and it's reaching people would wouldn't otherwise benefit from the outreach though.)  I suppose, if you wanted to reduce my argument down to it essence, it's like this - how would you feel about STEM in college having more focus on how it relates to fashion and beauty? How would you feel if they used the color pink to encourage women into roles that they are underrepresented in (pink truck interiors, pink military uniforms... iunno, just go with me on this okay)?"

I do see your point with the use of the color pink in encouraging women into underrepresented roles, though. What do you think we can do to show men that it's OK to cry and seek help? What language can we use?"
FemmeThoughts,2dq53y,meanttolive,2,Sun Aug 17 17:34:24 2014 UTC,Man. I know that it takes courage to seek help. I know that through my troubles (serious health problems) that asking for help has sometimes even been harder than needing help. It must be a nightmare when society judges you for it as a man.

There has to be a way to educate people about the importance of good nutrition for kids without this weird blaming baggage.  And it can't just be up to the parents. It's an economic issue and a policy issue, not just an issue of parenting.   Parents know the importance of giving their kids healthy food. But a lot of the time they can't.

FemmeThoughts,2dl8z4,Super_Frez,5,Fri Aug 15 20:15:42 2014 UTC,"Not sure if anyone else saw the video, but it was on the front page of reddit last week.    I actually thought it was a good PSA, and it offered a different perspective that what we don't normally get.  I didn't see the mother blaming as much, but I thought it focused on the western philosophy as a whole.  The part that stuck out to me the most was the teacher rewarding the kid for getting a good grade by giving him a piece of candy.  To me that reflected how we as a whole celebrate things in life: with unhealthy food.  I avoid wheat, processed foods, and foods w/ added sugars as much as possible, and until I started this I never realized how much shit food is shoved in our faces.  This PSA might be a bit aggressive and not quite on the mark, but it fuels a discussion, which we so desperately need in this country.  Everyday we are getting fatter, sicker, and more unhealthy. We are bringing the rest of the world to our level of unhealthy, and the only ""people"" who are winning in this are the Food and Pharmaceutical companies."
FemmeThoughts,2dl8z4,Super_Frez,5,Fri Aug 15 06:19:51 2014 UTC,"Not sure if anyone else saw the video, but it was on the front page of reddit last week.

We are bringing the rest of the world to our level of unhealthy, and the only ""people"" who are winning in this are the Food and Pharmaceutical companies.   I absolutely agree, but I don't think the PSA touches on any of that. It doesn't touch on food deserts. It doesn't touch on the lack of regulation in the food industry. This isn't just an issue of the behaviour of parents, guardians and so on. In huge ways, this is an economic issue. You need to live in places where there are good markets. You need to live in places where there are sidewalks, and parks. You need to be able to spend the extra money and time. Bread with high fructose corn syrup and lots of preservatives is cheaper. And it lasts a lot longer too.  This PSA takes a huge issue which has a lot to do with economics and lack of regulation, and it makes it entirely an individual/small community problem.   So I don't know how much that will help. The PSA isn't going to get anyone out of a food desert or give them access to parks. It doesn't raise awareness about lack of food regulation. It doesn't do anything to help people afford better foods, or extend SNAP benefits.  Meanwhile, we've also vastly changed childhood in terms of how much running around kids do. Is some of that on parents? Sure. But it's also on longer school days, with less time for running around and more hours of homework. It's on this weird thing we have going now where parents who send their kids to the local park to play (instead of keeping them inside with them, playing video games) get arrested and have their kid taken away.  Have you ever seen that map of how far children were allowed to go in each generation? Part of the issue is that.   So, yes, there are a lot of societal things at play here, and awareness is important, but I don't think this PSA touches on any of the big issues here. And I think the issue they do touch on is the one that everyone already knows about. if you're on SNAP, you get tonnes of brochures about eating healthy. Whenever you're on the phone with the office, the entire recording is all about eating healthy. Schools do a lot of coverage on this too, so do doctors, and new parent magazines and so on.  Most parents know that what they put in their kids mouths is really, really, really important. But knowing that doesn't give them more money with which to buy groceries.  So yeah, I agree, there's a lot we need to do. But I don't think PSA focuses on any of the really important issues."

I met with my college program coordinator yesterday because I had a few fails and the school system said I was kicked from my program. I had emailed him previously explaining that this year I was dealing with both a crazy, drug dealing roommate, and flying back and forth to my home town for a court case with my rapist from a few years ago. I was prepared for the worst and I have lost sleep for weeks from the stress of not being able to continue my program.  Well holy shit! My coordinator was exceptionally understanding and kind, and said he knew that waiting a year and being left behind in my program was not a fun option, so he bent the rules and is allowing me to continue with my classmates in all but one class. I will retake the courses I failed, and I'll only be behind in one stream (programming, ughhh) as opposed to several. I'll take courses in the summer to improve my GPA, and I should be able to graduate on time if I can catch up in programming in the coming years.  I cannot describe the intense relief I am feeling now, I am just over the moon! I'm finally free of the stress of failure, and I'm super stoked to start my second year this fall.

I think the best thing to understand her, and her conservatism which has this distance between you as a result, is to understand why it is that is her comfort zone.   With my mom, her mother was an absent, abusive drunk (but funny) woman so my mother never learned how to bond as a daughter so never had the skill set as a mother to bond or support me when shit got real.  Just ask her about her, let her talk, be supportive, be interested ""tell me more"" or ""why is that"" a safe way to dig without being demanding or overstepping comfort zones.  So wish you the best!"

I think my mum will have had any emotional displays suppressed during her childhood. She's from a traditional stiff upper lip British back ground, conservative and middle class, and knowing my gran I can imagine my mum being punished for getting upset as a kid or at least strongly discouraged from showing her feelings. She might also feel a lot of guilt about being absent during my childhood whilst she worked away from home to support us, and that absence has put a lot of distance between us and harmed my trust in her. But she is a good person and I think we can rebuild things."
FemmeThoughts,2dl444,AwkwardBurritoChick,1 point,Fri Aug 15 07:10:01 2014 UTC,"I live about 300 miles away from my children and much a large part of that decision to be physically distant was hard on all of us, but my late teen children know I did it so I could better myself to put myself in a position to better provide for them in the short and long term.  I may have been physically distant, but I've done my best and know I'm emotionally close with my children....   I feel with your mother as most likely her feelings may be of guilt of not being ""there"" for you, but she in a way has...  I only was best prepared for this challenge because my SO, boyfriend, was not raised by his biological mother, but her sister and husband.  He assured me, and near a decade and a half he has been dead on, that when we see each other, it's like no time has passed.  For you to ease any guilt your mother feels, just grab her one hand with both of yours when she shares her side... we, as mothers that aren't 'there' we feel such tremendous guilt where it turns out when we explain situations, decisions at the time, we're usually forgiven.  I think that would be the best gift for her.. to have tea, double hold her hand and hear her out... let her vent.  Let her know you forgive and understand she did her best.  Even if it infuriates or angers you, just hold it in for a day or two, but just over tea, hear her out and give her that unconditional love so you can open the door and let her release what I imagine a tremendously heavy burden and conflict.  For me with my children, no matter how angry, upset, we do put shit aside and hear each other out... not always easy. but I have not regretted any moment with any one I love to hear them out, no matter how hard or upsetting, to bite my lip and mull over what they said and then revisit the conversation with respect and acknowledgement of what they said and then politely, softly, firmly, stating my response and/or even my side as I lived through it and as to why I made the decisions I did.  So the common factor, polite, honest, forthright, patience, understanding, empathy, listen, listen listen, and kindly revisit in a most cautious manner....  In being a distance and ""absent"" physical mother, if you'd like PM me if she'd like to reach out to another woman who understands our dilemma.   We're a rare bunch - often misunderstood as we are deemed ""unfit"" where those like me, we simply do what loving mothers do.. make the best decision for our children's best interest before our own happiness and self interest....  I am willing to bet not a  day goes by where she doesn't think about you and regret she's not there for you more.. but she's not aware that she is with you everyday.  It's hard for 'absent' parents but let her know you understand she loved and loves you the best she could and can, and you still appreciate and love her and would like to see it go to the next level (e,g, tea or lunch once a month, post cards, emails.... etc.)  I can assure you that once you let her know ""Mom, I love, and forgive and understand you and your decisions, now that I'm xx old, lets redefine this relationship on our terms, fuck everyone else and what they think or say""  That it will get better... I can promise that.  Though sounds like your mom might need more conservative vernacular and earl grey...."

Or go ""Wow, BF and his Mom are close, they share everything.  Did you know that I [insert hope or dream]""  I wouldn't get into the heavy stuff about your dad unless you're in private.  What are her triggers?  Why would she get upset?  Is it that she doesn't want to be inappropriate or deal with feelings so she avoids it?  I would start by trying to understand what about it makes her uncomfortable and trying to avoid those things.  Like if she's really insecure have lots of things you like about her or your relationship ready.  Just curious but what culture are you coming from?  WASP?  Asian?  Do you have siblings or close friends who know her you could ask about making the relationship better?  You say you're ""sore"" right now.

Sometimes if you spend time doing something, the other person can let down their guard a little. Like cooking, you start asking questions about what you are doing, then gently ask more personal questions like ""did you do this kind of thing with your mom"" and eventually more personal like ""how do you feel about this"".  The thing is: Close relationships take time. You probably can not build one during one visit. But you have time! You can set your intention to be loving, kind and respectful to you mom, and get started toward a closer relationship. Then each time you talk or visit you can build on it.  Good luck!

I think the writers tried to make it seem funny that in one second Drax is inadvertently insulting Gamora with the word ""whore"" while in the next he's shooting an enemy with a rocket for saying something much less offensive while saying ""no one insults my friends.""  They're suggesting that he either doesn't know the meaning, or doesn't see it as an insult.  Either way the butt of the joke then is Drax and not Gamora.  Gamora's outfit does sort of have a boob window (I'd say it has a strap across the chest), but it's at the top part of her chest which some women show while wearing business casual clothes.  I dunno.. I guess I left the theater feeling happy that she wasn't too sexed up, so I felt weird hearing that to the blogger who wrote the article was so amped up about it.  My big complaint with this movie, as is in almost every movie, is that 1/10th of the overall cast are women.  The prison guards, the prisoners, the Nova people are almost all dudes.  The only spot where there's more women are the overall city scenes, and the victims during the final attack scene.  Just my 2c."

There seems to be an insane amount of pressure from around the internet (on reddit people especially seem to be into very young women/girls) and from advertisement to look as young as possible. I think the feelings you're having are pretty damn common, especially when makeup trends seem to shifting to more ""cute"" or ""youthful"" style.  That said, I've noticed that most men don't tend to notice those wrinkles until they're REALLY defined, and even so there's no way that'd be a deal breaker unless you're dating someone with completely unrealistic standards."

FemmeThoughts,2dikso,not_margaret,23,Thu Aug 14 17:52:17 2014 UTC,"Reddit is so image obsessed it scares me. Red Pill thoughts about expiration dates on women's beauty have somehow leaked into the main stream consciousness and pass for collective truth. Whenever someone in a long term loving and functional relationship pipes up about the realities of love and beauty people cry ""wife goggles"" and dismiss the opinion.  If you plan on making your living as a model or sexual fantasy you need to worry about wrinkles. If you plan on working at Hooters or as a 1960's stewardess or as a professional cheerleader maybe there is a problem.  Outside of that, there is not a problem. People who fall in love with people (not with images and sex objects) fall in love with wrinkles.    Wrinkles aren't just normal, they are sexy and attractive as hell. You know that way that the edges of a ""distinguished"" gentleman's eye can crinkle and it is sexy as hell? Applies to women too, our culture just doesn't talk about it.  There is a near absence of sexy older women depicted in mainstream media, but that doesn't mean they don't exist, and that people aren't attracted to them.  I am married to a 31 year old woman (I am also a woman) and she is developing deep wrinkles around her eyes.  I LOVE them. I LOVE LOVE LOVE them. They are sexy as hell. Being old is sexy. Being of the same age as your partner, and at the same life experience level is sexy. The changes that a life lived writes on a body are sexy.  Also, I am backing up u/katrionatronica on this one. ""Age has nothing on love.""  My grandmother had a terrible first marriage and then found the love of her life at 65 or so. They were together and deeply in love for 30 years."

Taking care of yourself is pretty important.   Sunscreen! And skincare in general.  /r/SkincareAddiction is fabulous, as /u/spunky-omelette pointed out.   Along with the above recommendation, drink water, get enough sleep, and don't smoke. Eat things that are mostly good for you.  Especially vegetables.   Move!  Get some physical activity!  If you want your body to stay youthful, stay in shape!  Aging leads to a loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia) and a decline in bone density.  The most effective thing you can do to fight this is to do some form of strength training that will let you progressively add resistance.  Heavy lifting is extremely helpful, but there are ways of doing bodyweight exercises that will work just as well. Go out and have a kickass life and make lots of good stories.  Do new things.

FemmeThoughts,2dfawz,Thai_Hammer,5,Wed Aug 13 10:15:54 2014 UTC,His definitions are a bit skewed! As a sex critical feminist I believe your empowerment should have as much or as little to do with your sex life as you choose and that pushing all women to abstain from sex or pushing all women to be overtly sexual dismisses the fundamental goal of feminism as a whole to give women a choice. Most sex positive feminism dosn't work well for survivors of sexual abuse and asexual people. Most sex negative feminism dosn't work well for heterosexual women with a high sex drive and sex workers. And that's totally understandable. I would like to encourage you all to do your own thing regardless of how it plays in to the patriarchal views of sex because we can't let our lives revolve around what men don't or do want. May the virgin goddess Athena give you the clarity to determine what you choose based on how you feel and not how you're told to feel.

I believe in a world where everybody should have everything regardless of their contributions to society. Until this is possible I agree with everything that seems close to this condition. The perspectives of capitalism might fuel our advancements in science but they also make us entitled (we have to assign values to things, deeds and beings) and inhumane (we begrudge and exploit because in capitalism resources deliberately run short)."
FemmeThoughts,2df50c,the253monster,1 point,Thu Aug 14 12:53:02 2014 UTC,"I think we need to agree on a definition, as the OED (and me!) define capitalism as a system of economy based on the free exchange of goods and capital by private citizens, rather than the government. I agree that, in the crony capitalist system under which most capitalist countries operate today, people can easily USE it as a means to the end of ""amassing power and more value,"" but to add those terms to the definition only serves to dilute the purpose of capitalism: To create a system of economy un-hindered and un-regulated by the government.  When i think of this in congress with feminism, I think of it like this: In a true capitalist (read: anarcho-capitalist) society, big corporations which are allowed to create monopolies and abuse their workers wouldn't really exist, because, before they got there, the market, informed by the fact that its participants decide every company's fate based on need, realizes the potential for future abuses and refuses to populate said company with its business. The same would be true for companies which discriminate against people due to race and gender. The market would literally be able to cripple the company to accommodate the needs of that company's workers. These are just two quick examples of how SJ and (true, anarcho-) capitalism are not mutually exclusive.  Keep in mind i'm not arguing against socialism but rather for capitalism. I just want to be a participant in discourse.  Edit: i accidentally a word"
FemmeThoughts,2df50c,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Aug 14 14:54:14 2014 UTC,"To create a system of economy un-hindered and un-regulated by the government.   I don't see an advantage here. Can't governments just be seen as additional participants in the market that are maintained to help to ""decide every company's fate based on need""?  Let's imagine there are persons who don't provide any value to society. They can't fulfill any need. Those persons nevertheless should be happy and have their needs fulfilled. How can ""true capitalism"" ensure that?"
FemmeThoughts,2df50c,the253monster,1 point,Thu Aug 14 15:10:44 2014 UTC,"So to address the government thing: Don't you think it's a little unfair that a government can make laws hindering the activities of certain corporations, you know, as a participant in the market like you just said, but the other corporations can't? Doesn't that put them at an unfair advantage? There's someone competing with a corporation who's in the government's pockets so the government can (and has, by bailing out big banks that were going to fail) quell that, plus there is a lack of market oversight in the government, since they answer to who? only themselves. This is a cycle that's perpetuated today.   True capitalism CAN ensure that by creating privately held, privately managed versions of what we call welfare now, where the capital for these sorts of things is not taken via force (read as: the threat of jail) out of the pockets of people who can't afford to pay. It would create that because a capitalist market is based on the demand of the consumers. Think of it this way: For the purpose of this example, I am buried under mountains of medical and student debt. I make, for the purpose of this example, less than $25,000 a year before taxes. AFTER taxes, a lot of which go to social programs, i make little enough that i cannot afford rent, car insurance, health insurance, AND food, not to mention paying off medical and student debt on a consistent basis. But I WANT to help the poor and in need. Wouldn't it be better to allow me to, free of taxes, work my ass off on paying off all of my debts in order that i may WILLINGLY contribute to social programs? I think so.   Capitalism provides me, the capitalist, to free myself of debt at a quicker rate, in order that i might eagerly participate in social programs which, as of now, i (still the person in the example) have a deficit of resources with which to do so. You can use examples of today's corporations to say that capitalism will not provide for those in need, but keep in mind the corporations which have grown out of control today have grown that way because of government regulation of smaller companies who can't afford to constantly be paying off government officials.  I definitely grant that this situation will never happen. But, for me, the state seems to hinder a lot of social progress that capitalism would contribute to, via freedom from the state. When the state tries to intervene in the private sector/sponsors private companies, THAT's when bad things happen. De-forestation isn't the brilliant idea of a multinational out to sap all the resources, it's the result of private companies being subsidized/funded by governments for the governments' own ends. They're then free of scrutiny because those who are at the highest levels, the government levels, don't need to answer to anyone.  I really hope that came off as reasonable and academic. I don't want to sound rude or harsh at any point.  Edit: Added the sentence about the market responding to need."

Those companies would fall for the same tricks that governments do. How do you even ensure that people don't form governments simply because they want to organize like that? The ethics of true capitalism assume that humans can assess the value of their own needs, but this isn't true (see e.g. the book Predictably Irrational). They also assume all humans are peaceful in nature and thus violence is avoided automatically by the market. I think humans are too diverse to assume that.  Beside this to me the problem lies within groups and organizations itself. I think humans are simply not able to form groups that are just and ethical. The only real salvation I see lies in transhumanism and technological singularity. Yet I think even as humans we can do much better than the current state of affairs by our very own means. I believe we can achieve this by striving for generosity and social welfare. I like where the Manifesto against Labour is going."

FemmeThoughts,2df50c,the253monster,1 point,Thu Aug 14 15:55:18 2014 UTC,"wow SUPER sorry. Very long work day. I don't think corporations would become semi-governments in the perfect capitalist system (read: anarcho-capitalism). Because, despite what i perceive to be certain people's inherent (or conditioned, either way) greed, I believe that a society governed by the non-aggression principle with a free exchange of goods and services would 1) not allow for the concept of what we see today as corporations (savvy members of the market would recognize abuses and the market would cripple that company before it got too huge) and 2) create a myriad of competing smaller businesses which would serve general needs and have specialties, the way big conglomerates cannot.   You're so very right about the basis for the ethics of true capitalism, but, as i briefly touched upon, i think a lot of good would come from privately managed, opt-in welfare systems, where people who have the means can provide care and financial assistance to those in need (maybe this is the optimist in me, but Warren Buffett and Bill Gates are making very strong cases for rich capitalists being capable of and willing to do good).   As for the THIRD point in your first paragraph, yes it is foolish to assume all humans are peaceful in nature, but i'm not assuming. I'm saying that, in order for an anarchist society to flourish (and, in turn, create different sects of anarchy including capitalism, communism, and whatever else), people need to consciously choose, as self-actualizing beings, to live by a principle of non-aggression. For me, states are so concerned about maintenance, paranoid even, that they involve themselves in conflict just to be in the public eye. When there is no state, when people are able to roam freely and associate TRULY freely, I feel that the want to be violent or to be deviant (though that is a very dismissive, often wrongfully used word) will be there in some, but will ultimately fall to peace and non-aggression.  As for your last paragraph, the pessimist in me completely agrees with you. Groups lead directly to alienation, ostracism, and violence (This is a great quote to support your claim). I ALSO definitely agree that transhumanism and the singularity (so far as my limited brain can understand both of those concepts) will result in some sort of ""grand equality."" I think, just as a final thought, that striving for generosity and social welfare are great, incredible things to do. But, as someone who despises the state and loves the concept of capitalism, I believe them to be at their most effective when people who have the means can opt in to them. I do not have the means, and I wish I could opt out until I do. Because once i do, i will give greatly and generously to bolster thrival in my community.   Thanks for reading all of my responses and engaging in this discussion. I'll be reading your two links over the course of the next few days.

A lot of POC rights groups in the 50s-70s were heavily influenced by Leninism or Maoism. And most socialist/communist political movements are more openly supportive of SJ ideas than other parties. That (plus the large amount of fuckery from capitalism) is probably why you see a lot of anti-capitalist sentiment in social justice movements.

I mean like breaking up over the phone/in a public place, changing your number, telling family/friends what's up and not to tell him where you are, and resolving to go zero-contact so he can't ""bb im sry"" his way back in. I don't know much about your situation, but in my experience it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to scary assholes like this."

You're isolated from your friends and family in a new city (because of him getting a new job? wanting a fresh start?) and he's starting to unload on you more than ever. Usually that's when physical abuse begins.   Get outta that situation, girl! I would also suggest breaking up over the phone / in a note / in an email because he doesn't sound too healthy.

FemmeThoughts,2d5web,FreyjaSunshine,11,Sun Aug 10 18:33:33 2014 UTC,"Hugs!  I was in an abusive marriage for 21 years.  It's MUCH better on the other side.  Do what you gotta do, and GTFO.  You're not controlling, you're the victim of his projection.  He's the controlling one.  You deserve better, and being alone in a new city is still better than being someone's punching bag.  I used to feel horribly lonely in my marriage, but now that I'm out, I'm often alone but never lonely.    In a healthy relationship, each person cares about the other's feelings.  My ex-husband got upset when I was pregnant because he was annoyed by all my vomiting.  No sympathy, no empathy - the only person he cared about was HIM.  That's just one example of the hundreds I put up with for way too long.  Take some time to get to know yourself, spoil yourself a little, and treat yourself the way you deserve to be treated.  Sometime in the future, you will find a man who will treat you that way, too.  Expect it, and settle for nothing less.  You deserve to be treated like a human being who matters, because that's who you are.  You can do this.  more hugs"
FemmeThoughts,2d5web,julialex,7,Mon Aug 11 00:04:45 2014 UTC,"Because it is sometimes hard to be objective once you are involved, the easy way to test if the person is treating you badly is: would they act this way at work? I'm guessing he wouldn't shout at a coworker and tell the coworker they owed him a catharsis. (If he would, he is a psycho who won't have a job long because they wouldn't put up with that).   I'm glad you were able to see that this isn't normal."

Not usually a big problem, except that I am in a foreign country, that's highly bureaucratic, and I'm still in the process of getting all the paperwork needed to see a doctor. Annoyingly enough, having got the third and final bit of paper, the first bit of paper has expired and needs renewing and the second bit of paper needs replacing because another official took it to get the third bit of paper.   Just to top it off, I have to do all these activities in Spanish. I've already dealt with the hospital once in Spanish since arriving. I daresay it's easier than dealing with the tax office in Spanish, but it's another ball ache when my eye is swollen up and hurting constantly.   So I'll be off to the doctor this afternoon with my one bit of paper. Hopefully the doctor will be open because it's Friday afternoon during summer and many places, yes including doctors, shut. Then shut all weekend.   I don't wanna go to hospital with an eye infection just because I can't see a doctor! I'm entitled to free emergency treatment here but this isn't exactly what I consider an emergency. My boyfriend has also been suffering a strange nausea all week and is in exactly the same paperwork situation as me.  I've been otherwise well prepared health-wise as I suffer from crohns disease, and I've made sure I've got all my regular drugs well stocked from home and all my emergency treatments too so I don't need to see a doctor until the wild good paper chase is completed. Didn't need a bloody infected eye. The pharmacy have already given me what they can and it's got worse instead of better.  Argh!  Edit: Doctor is open. Let's see if I can actually see one.

(Forget about the rest of the bad science in the film.) While I  partially understand why certain decisions get made in Hollywood, here's where the real problem is: How would has been around for nearly 100 years as a crucial American, let alone global, industry and it still struggles to produce more then 3 or 4 people of color as major box office stars? And this isn't completely our faults as the viewers and consumers, though we can make more of a demand for more people of color in more diverse roles and going out to see those films and those productions. Hell, that goes for the small screen too. It's just really poor excuse for an industry whose people like to put on heirs about their open-mindedness."
FemmeThoughts,2cps42,Thai_Hammer,7,Tue Aug 5 20:36:48 2014 UTC,"I'm in the film industry, and maybe i can speak to the reasons for the casting in this film and others (this is particularly applicable to that moses/exodus movie that's coming out). Casting works like this: The developers and producers (sometimes one in the same, sometimes different) get together and make MASSIVE lists of actors (think 40-50 really famous people) that they would accept for every role in a film. They present these lists to whoever is funding the movie. The person or company funding the movie returns with the lists categorized by WANT, ACCEPTABLE, MAYBE, and NO (those are not always, and sometimes not even often, the exact words they use. The point is there are categories). These categories are based on an actor's popularity in print (how many magazines with their face/body have been sold), on social media (how many positive mentions they have on twitter/facebook), and in ticket sales (statistically, based on their past films' budgets, what the gross revenue has been)  For actors in the top tier, let's call them A list actors, the fund or funds expects a large financial return on their investment, by virtue of the actor's popularity (Scar Jo would undoubtedly almost always fall into this category), and thus will release more funds if the producers can convince the actor to join the project. In addition to providing more of the movie's budget for that actor, they also adjust the percentage return they expect via ticket sales. For actors in the B range, they will probably still give slightly more money, but will not adjust the expected return on investment. This is the safest choice, statistically, for the producers, but making money is about risks, so studios and developers try to stay within the A range, unless the movie is under the ""indie"" umbrella, in which case they'll pick actors who are approaching the A or B ranges. The process goes on so that C and D ""list"" actors result in minimal extra funds or no extra funds at all, and so the onus is on the producers to find people in the A and B list, almost all of whom are either the best actors in the business, or, as in Scarlett Johansson's case, the actors considered most conventionally attractive (read as: White, heteronormative).   The problem with this process is that, while there are non-white, non-hetero-normative actors who usually fall into the top two categories, they are often ""gotten,"" so-to-speak, by smaller, more niche projects. The reason for this is that as non-white or non-hetero-normative actors, it is traditionally hard to find roles because, as Ice Cube says in ""21 Jump Street,"" a big part of being an actor is to ""Embrace your stereotype."" And to get work, most famous actors either have had to do that once or continuously do that throughout their entire career.   It's not that embracing one's stereotype is right, it's that actors spend the first part of their careers developing a ""brand"" that will ensure their future is filled with work, and a lot of times that brand includes embracing their stereotype. And since most non-white actors have a brand specific to their perceived ""race,"" they're usually off doing stuff with relation to that.  Combine all of these factors with the fact that most TV and film is made in order to sell ads and merchandise (save for the truly independent stuff which is increasingly being funded by people who appreciate deviation from the norm) and you've got an industry that intends to remain white-dominated, male-dominated, and sexist.   Thankfully, as i mentioned, there are projects coming out more and more often (i'm particularly excited about ""Dear White People"") that don't adhere to this formula. But as it stands now, the formula makes a lot of money for a lot of people, up to and including the lowest level union representative on a set, and so it will probably be in place for a while."

FemmeThoughts,2cps42,totes_meta_bot,3,Sat Aug 9 18:21:01 2014 UTC,I think the diversity we see comes from the efforts of individual producers/directors or actors who invite a friend actor who happens to be non-white. It seems it's harder for women to get in like that.

Because you feel like you’ve fallen into this realm of “Wait a minute. The sky is blue, right?”   This completely resonates with me; I've pretty much stopped debating MRAs online because of this. I once debated a guy who was honestly convinced the USA was a matriarchy, and one of his points of evidence to support this insanity was the fact that more women tend to vote in elections than men, therefore women hold more political power, therefore matriarchy. So much WTF in that argument, yet he was utterly convinced this was the case, despite the fact that less than 20% of politicians are female, there has never been a female president, and last but not least the utterly ridiculous notion that having a single vote in an indirect voice system (which is what democracy actually is) is a form of power.

FemmeThoughts,2co51a,SomeOldGoat,6,Wed Aug 6 03:21:37 2014 UTC,"Ugh - and no awareness that maybe the reason men pay more in tax is because of the gendered wage gap, an immensely complex thing which is the result of biases, systemic discrimination and the imposition of gender roles on people (such as the expectation that men be bread-winners and women be child-rearers, still a very relevant issue considering the overwhelming majority of SAH-parents are women, and even in families where both parents work, time studies show that it is mothers who do more of the childcare)?

My grandmother had been plagued all her life with illness. By listening to what my mum has said, I think she developed postpartum thyroiditis which with time became full on hypothyroidism as she never got treatment for her thyroid - so this led her to being put on prozac due to ""postpartum depression"". She encountered a lot of issues with her heart and high blood pressure - not surprising to me now given my own hypothyroidism diagnosis. Towards the end of her life she lost a lot of her ability to live alone. A lot of her organs began to shut down and this resulted in her renal failure. We thought that would take her so we prepared to help her fight to the end and to die at home. It wasn't a discussion or a thing my mum wanted me to be involved with but I insisted.   One day at school my sister and I got told to go on the bus home to my mum best friend's. Mum said she would pick us up there. She seemed a little weird when she arrived and soon we left for home, which is where she told us grandma had had a stroke and this was the end. I remember not handling the news well. She died 6 hours after I was told. My grandma was certainly not like a lot of the cases supported by the movement and I know she would never have wanted to end her life. But she's the reason I began to support the ""death/dying with dignity"" movement - a movement that campaigns for the rights for the terminally ill to end their lives.

FemmeThoughts,2cny6h,NowThatsAwkward,2,Tue Aug 5 14:17:23 2014 UTC,"The average amount of blood lost during a period is 30-40ml (millilitres), with nine out of 10 women losing less than 80ml. Therefore, heavy menstrual bleeding is considered to be 60-80ml or more in each cycle.   Source, NHS  As the other comment mentions, cups have measurements on them. I haven't used them in awhile, but I believe some tampon packages (I'm thinking of OBs specifically) contain info on how many ml of fluid each size of tampon holds. So when you've soaked through one, you know approximately how much you've bled since you inserted it.   I also used to use tampon weights as a vague guide. If you're using a light tampon, at the max amount of time it should be used for, and it's too dry to remove easily, then your flow is very very light. If you soak through an ultra tampon every couple hours, your flow is extremely heavy. (I had each at different times because of health issues)  It can definitely be helpful to have an idea of how heavy or light your flow is, for talking to your gyno. Best of luck!"

FemmeThoughts,2cny6h,twistedfork,2,Tue Aug 5 16:44:28 2014 UTC,My periods now are 3 days max of what I'd call moderate to heavy bleeding (have to change a regular tampon every four hours or so) and I have generally 1 day of cramps. I used to have a copper IUD and my periods were five full days and I'd generally have stronger cramps for 2-3 days. Definitely an increase in bleeding to the more heavy range were I had to use super tampons. Also I would have random crampy shooting pains that would last a couple seconds on the occasional normal day. This is apparently normal but no one told me that before hand and it definitely scared me so I figure you should have a heads up if you go that route! Hopefully that helps with your decision.
FemmeThoughts,2cny6h,pencilears,1 point,Tue Aug 5 19:13:53 2014 UTC,"For me, a light period would be not needing to change ""regular"" tampon in 4 hours. A medium period would be not needing to change a ""super"" tampon in 4 hours. A heavy period would be needing to change a Super+ tampon in four hours or less.  While I was in high school my periods were HEAVY. I knew they were heavy. I had to change my tampon after every class because I would leak through in the next class. I ALWAYS used a pad and a tampon. I would leak EVERY SINGLE NIGHT and slept on a towel. The heaviest period I ever had was when I was in college and it was like a faucet, unending blood. (I also had super blood clots during this time. Not like ""dime sized"" but half dollar + size)  I now have what I would consider ""medium"" period and I generally need a regular or super tampon ever 4 hours depending on the day in my cycle. If I use a super+ I can usually go a whole work day. I actually think my periods are more painful cramp-wise now, but much easier to deal with since I'm not staining everything I own. The last day of my period is ""light"" and usually I don't use anything or a panty liner."

FemmeThoughts,2ceri7,AcidRose27,22,Sat Aug 2 09:39:44 2014 UTC,"Former recruiter here - yup, that is good, solid advice. Studies on hiring discrimination suggest that a lot of discrimination at the CV stage is based on unconscious biases, so removing a gendered identifier reduces the risk of those biases coming into play. Another option is if your name has a gender-neutral nickname you could use instead (for example Harriet could be Harry), then using that instead could help.   This doesn't just apply to gender; race is also frequently discriminated against and if you have a first name that is very ""ethnic"" in nature, then initialising can help overcome racial biases. Of course, if you have a non Anglo-Saxon surname then there is little you can do!  I certainly wouldn't advise putting Mr instead of Ms/Mrs - spelling mistakes usually top lists of things hiring managers most hate, and so that would give them an excuse to reject you once they find out."

FemmeThoughts,2ceri7,bootomyuterus,2,Tue Aug 5 06:13:16 2014 UTC,"Hmm, interesting question - I think it's something where you have to weigh up the relative risks and benefits. Working within your field I am sure that active social media profiles, blogs on issues pertaining to your field of work etc. would be a benefit, so you should definitely keep them on your CV. However, it might be worth rethinking the positioning to put them closer to the bottom, so they have to read your CV first before they can google you - a lot of hiring prejudice is subconscious, and first impressions are made in the first 30 seconds reading a CV! Within your field I am almost certain that recruiters and hiring managers would google you, so it would be worth doing an audit of your online presence, to see what they can see and make sure it is appropriate - for example, if you have a twitter account where your name is identifiable but it is only used for personal stuff, it might be worth protecting the account during the duration of the job search. Also, check what images of you exist online on your blog and social media accounts - the advice for women is that for images that employers could see, you should be wearing something smart (not overly smart, but at least business casual), be smiling, and not be showing cleavage. I agree that advice is somewhat sexist, but it does make a difference!"

A lot of people think doctors should be allowed to follow their own moral/ethical conscience. I dunno. If I was a doctor, sure, I'd want to be able to refuse to perform a non-emergency procedure that I felt was ethically wrong. If I was a scared, pregnant 15-year-old out in rural Ontario, though, and my doctor refused to help me out because s/he didn't want to, I don't think I'd care too much about that doctor's feelings on the matter. The problem with Canada is that most of it is insanely rural – huge area and relatively tiny population – and there are far too few physicians available at all, let alone in remote areas. So doctors refusing to help patients basically leave those patients helpless. Not everyone, usually/especially those in need of medical care, is able to simply ""find another doctor""."

You can't just sign up for a job then refuse to do said job. It's like that nurse that is refusing to prescribe birth control and is now suing because she didn't get hired... for a job that requires prescribing birth control.  These people are dangerous. Maybe it's time to create a separate subset of doctors called religious MD or some shit. Then any doctor that refuses specific treatments on moral or religious grounds would have to identify themselves. So when someone goes to the doctor, they know there are treatments and procedures being denied to them.  Let the rest of us go to the real MDs."

You'll remember I had a hell of a time fighting my own GP to get meds I KNOW that would have helped me somewhat, but he denied them based on pathetic standards set by the health care system. The number one rule of being a doctor is ""do no harm"", if something can help someone they should be given it. It's like they're content seeing their patients suffer and get worse before they'll treat. They were happy that I couldn't study or work because of how shitty I was and at the rate I was gaining weight.   I had people from the States angry in thyroid FB groups because I wasn't given the meds I needed through the NZ public system. And now that I saw a private doctor who gives a fuck about thyroids, and getting on natural thyroid meds, I'm doing so much fucking better. I've managed to contract the flu and this is the worst I've felt in weeks when I know just a few months ago I was feeling like this everyday.   My GP would never have picked up on the fact my body isn't producing progesterone, that my adrenals were fucked, that I was risk of getting cancer if the low progesterone continued, I could have possibly developed rickets from a severe Vitamin D deficiency (I'm on a dose now that could kill the average person - and so much so that my pills are only available by prescription due to mg amount), that my cortisol was so low it was messing with my organs, and that I'm an iron based anemic, I could also be pre-diabetic but we don't know because I have iron based anemia. He would never have picked up on ANY of that shit because he didn't want to do a full panel. Technically I should have been given the Mirena for free due to all this but noooooooooooooooooooooope. There goes $400 I didn't have, and then the extra $800 I've spent on the private doctor and meds.   //rant  //totally a really late reply"

Again, nobody believed me (told me to take advil) and they just kept letting it go.  Now my knees are shot. Turns out my knee caps were out of place and because they were left like that for so long all of the cartilage was scraped off and now it's bone grinding on bone.

FTA:   Dawkins parodied harsh responses by later tweeting: ""'Stealing £1 is bad. Stealing an old lady's life savings is worse.' How DARE you rank them? Stealing is stealing. You're vile, appalling.""    Yeah, well, here's the thing: rape is not like getting mugged. Everyone reacts differently to trauma like rape, and that's why it's pretty much always pointless to fucking rank different types of rape, for fuck's sake. That's the kind of thinking that leads to concepts such as ""legitimate rape."" That's the kind of thinking that leaves so many survivors in the dark and allows rapists to keep on doing what they do, because as long as they're not holding a knife to victims' throats, well, it's not that bad.  Rape happens to all kinds of people, in all kinds of situations, and it is a violation of bodily autonomy and it is incredibly insulting and displays a deep lack of compassion to equate money with bodily autonomy.

FemmeThoughts,2c2j4m,dedededede,3,Wed Jul 30 00:13:36 2014 UTC,"All three theories are about how human beings learn (from a pedagogical/psychological as well as epistemological/philosphical perspective).  Behaviorism and cognitivism basically say how we are very direct products of our environment (cognitivism additionally believes in a filter-like brain). Both see a person as some kind of machine that we just don't fully understand yet. Therapies and educational programs following these schools of thought often rely on conditioning, direct instructions, rule systems and other things that relate to their ""machine-like"" idea of human. Behind the scenes there is the idea that it is possible to determine the one and only truth by scientific methods.  Here are two main problems with this:   Both theories see our brain as some kind of passive component or filter not as an active participant. Thus they claim we are all recipients of the same objective truth that is merely distorted by our senses, cognitive abilities and prior stimuli. Both theories more or less ignore second-order cybernetics, the notion that the scientist herself and everything around her is a huge influence when it comes to scientific methods.   This often leads to simplifications and generalizations about how to deal with humans and how they experience things. When you think you are an objective observer it is pretty easy to make ""objective"" assumptions. The belief in an observable objective truth introduces a huge normative factor. A person ""as a machine"" can be ""broken"" or ""malfunctioning"" and can be ""fixed"". It leads to very entitled scientists who think they know how persons should ""normally"" be or perceive things (like in Dawkins' case).  Constructivism separates between the subjective truth and the ""real truth"". It claims that we only experience the first. This subjective truth is made up by personal assumptions about the world that are constantly challenged by our personal experiences. Everybody recursively constructs a new personal truth based on the previous subjective truth and these challenging individual experiences (which generally occur in a social context).  This leads to the notion that you are not entitled to judge about somebody else's experiences and way of life. You have to accept that everybody has their own truth and we can only ""harmonize"" our truths to understand each other. Problems arise when your personal truth is challenged by an experience in a very fundamental way or when your experiences and/or social surroundings are constantly in disharmony with your personal truth (e.g. through double bind situations).  If Dawkins would think in a constructivist manner he probably would never seriously think about casually comparing events which bring so horrible ""challenging"" experiences that can shatter your personal truth in an instant.  FYI you can also seek for a constructivist psychotherapy."

FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,sugarhoneybadger,12,Mon Jul 28 14:13:18 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, I haven't dealt with these kinds of issues.  With the gynecologist, you should have told the nurse that you knew it wasn't a UTI. If they insisted on you taking the test, you'd just have to make another appointment for as soon as they'd get the results back, almost certainly negative.  I think that one thing you can do is write down all of your symptoms: how long you've had them, the frequency, the intensity, etc.  I think you need to doctor shop for someone who will take your issues seriously at the first meeting.  One thing that might help is knowing that stress can cause a lot of pain, and that the doctors don't understand the mechanism that makes this happen. According to my abnormal psychology text book, even issues that used to be consider pscyhosomatic deserve proper treatment from doctors because the pain and symptoms are real. You know from your IBS that they don't know how to treat you.  Perhaps there are threads about how to better advocate for yourself.  When they tell you to rest, you should tell them that you get 8 hours of sleep a night, practice yoga, and meditate. Now what would they suggest?"
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,jrl2014,12,Mon Jul 28 15:45:40 2014 UTC,"Yes! OP, I was going to suggest keeping a log of your symptoms. You might notice a pattern you never did before. You and your doctor might be able to deduce that when you do X you have symptoms Y and Z and together that could mean there's a cause no one picked up on before.  I know a lot of times you have to be firm with your doctors and let them know how you feel and what other doctors have tested you for and what those results were. Sometimes it will result in them backing off and sometimes they're just going to insist you be tested again anyhow, like in the case of the UTI test. Think of it like calling tech support for your internet. Yes, you may have turned your modem off and on again, you may have checked your settings to make sure you're on the right Wi-Fi network, but when you call to ask why your internet isn't working, the tech is going to run you through all the basic trouble shooting anyway.  If you have infections and inflamation that isn't getting better, that's not normal. There has to be some underlying cause. Perhaps something is wrong with your immune system or maybe your liver isn't filtering stuff out like it's supposed to, or perhaps you have some kind of chronic allergy that's suppressing your immune system. Like the previous comment said, you might have to shop around for the right doctor who will take the time and listen to you. Don't get discouraged if you don't find the cause in one or two visits. It might take a while.  Also, drink lots of water. That's just generally good advice."
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,MarthaGail,4,Mon Jul 28 16:24:28 2014 UTC,"The log of symptoms is especially important for the IBS.  It would help if she kept a log of her stress, hours of sleep, what she ate, what set her off etc.  That way she'll have enough info that she can go to a GI specialist and say: I'm reluctant to make appointments, because I keep getting the advice of resting more. Here's a log of what I tried when I tried to manage my IBS.   If he says there's nothing wrong or he can't do anything, OP should say. Thank you for being upfront with me. Please refer me to another specialist doctor, because I need to get healthier.  Idk, my lines are kind of dumb, but they're based on other discussions of how to advocate for yourself with your doctor."
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,jrl2014,4,Mon Jul 28 18:55:20 2014 UTC,"With the gynecologist, you should have told the nurse that you knew it wasn't a UTI. If they insisted on you taking the test, you'd just have to make another appointment for as soon as they'd get the results back, almost certainly negative.   I absolutely did tell them this and they still didn't want me to make an appointment for some reason. I am going to take the test today to placate them. Maybe then they will let me see the gyno again.  Good advice all around. I have been working on typing up a ""medical history"" in my own words because it seems like the paper trail the hospital has is not complete."
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,jrl2014,3,Mon Jul 28 17:21:33 2014 UTC,You can also request that your hospitals/doctors release your medical records. This will allow you to get the record as far back as you can.  I think they have to transfer them to each other at no cost to you.
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,saprofight,4,Mon Jul 28 18:50:57 2014 UTC,"I haven't personally, but I watched my mom go through similar things.  The only thing that saved her was having a fantastic general practitioner who took the time to know her as a person instead of just a list of symptoms.  Because of this he actually listened to all the symptoms she was having, ordered the right tests, and stood up for her to specialists who wanted to dismiss her as loopy.  Nothing worked like having a quality GP.  Doctors listen to other doctors way better than they listen to patients.  I have no advice about your symptoms in particular since I have zero formal medical training.  But, I would highly recommend that you skip on specialists and interview all of the general practitioners within your comfortable driving distance and ""hire"" the one that bothers to get to treat you as a human being.  Then, go from there with treatment.  Have some internet hugs and know that I'm cheering for you!"
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,reliably,6,Mon Jul 28 14:58:30 2014 UTC,"I think you might have to be a little assertive. When they tell you, wait two weeks and see if it improves, say, ""I've had these symptoms for the last 6 weeks and they have not improved. Why do you think I should wait?"" Push back against this. Ask them to explain why, ask them what you are supposed to do, etc.  Same with the nurse and the UTI. When she says, ""It is a UTI"" and you know it isn't, tell her that. Push back. Stand up for yourself.  I've been to lots of doctors and some of them - especially walk in clinics and certain specialists - are so so busy that they are really ready to put you in a box and not take a deeper look. Be firm about it, polite, and ask them to help you.   Final tip: When you find a doctor - any doctor - that takes you seriously about anything, ask them to recommend the other sorts of doctors you need and get a referral if possible. That way you'll be able to go to each new doctor saying, ""Dr. So-and-so suggested I see you for this reason""."
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,FreyjaSunshine,6,Mon Jul 28 18:49:05 2014 UTC,"As a physician (not primary care, though), I'd recommend the following:  Call around and see if you can find a primary care doctor who will be wiling to devote a chunk of time for a new-patient appointment to start getting your issues sorted out, and be willing to coordinate care with other physicians if that becomes necessary.  Then, before your appointment, list your symptoms on paper, with when they started, when they occur, what makes it better, what makes it worse.  Prioritize your list from what bothers you the most to the least.  It's unlikely that everything will be addressed at once.  Bring copies of any lab work or imaging studies from the last few years.  If you have to request copies of this from other docs, go ahead and get started on that.  It might decrease the amount of repeat labs that will need to be drawn.  You have the right to copies of your medical record by law, but may have to pay a per-page fee for copying and mailing it to you.  Bring the containers of any prescribed medications with you.  No guarantee, and I'm going to be sexist here, but a physician who is a woman might be less likely to blow off your complaints.  Family practice or internal medicine doctor should be fine.  It may take some trial and error to find someone with whom you can work to find answers.  At 26, you should not be having all of these problems.  It may be something obscure, or an unusual presentation for something more common, or just a mixture of several problems.  Stress/anxiety may play a role, or may not.  When you find a doctor willing to work with you on this, be consistent, don't shop around to other doctors without conferring with the primary doc first.  He/she may want you to see an ENT specialist for the sinus infection, or a GI doc for the bowel issues if the first line approaches don't pan out.  I hope you find someone who is able to put it all together for you."
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,FreyjaSunshine,1 point,Mon Jul 28 21:31:03 2014 UTC,I am going to take your advice. My past appointments have always resulted in my primary care (FNP) referring me to a specialist. I think the symptoms I have are fairly common for family practice or internists to treat and sometimes I wonder if all the referrals are actually part of the problem.   I found a female MD in family practice whose interests include women's health and allergies. We'll see if I can get an appointment. Thanks for sharing your opinion.
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,syringa,1 point,Tue Jul 29 16:05:21 2014 UTC,"Coordination of care is a huge problem these days.

We care."
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,Super_Mommy,5,Tue Jul 29 23:40:26 2014 UTC,"If you haven't considered it, I'd make an appointment with a rhuematologist. A lady I know also had a laundry list of symptoms, and when I was telling her about how I feel on a daily basis, she told me that after going to a rhuematologist she found out she actually had an autoimmune disorder. I really need to get there as well, but I can't afford the copay at the moment. I would give this a shot, as they are used to helping people who often have multiple inexplicable symptoms."
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,FreyjaSunshine,1 point,Mon Jul 28 20:29:48 2014 UTC,"That will be my next step although we do not have one where I live. I would have to get a referral to the special rheumatology clinic in a nearby city, about an hour away. I am totally willing to do this, but because all of my tests have come up negative so far, nobody thinks this is an autoimmune problem. A few doctors have suggested fibromyalgia, but that doesn't really fit either. Regardless, I think a rheumatologist is a great idea if I can find a way to see one.  My primary care doc has to make referrals or my insurance won't cover the treatment. She currently has sent me to a physiatrist and the nearest opening was at the end of August. So I'm guessing I have to wait til then, try whatever treatment the physiatrist wants me to do, and then if that doesn't work I get another referral?   It is also not out of the question that I could have several common disorders simultaneously. There may not be an underlying cause. I might just be very unlucky."

But, have you seen a naturopathic doctor? In college I took terrible care of myself. I barely slept, had reoccurring sinus infections, and UTIs, and my allergies were awful. What turned things around for me was seeing a naturopath. My body was not actually healing or getting what it needed from antibiotics and other ""western"" meds. Sounds like this may be the case for you, too, based on the time frame you have given. Good luck."

FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,plentyofrabbits,10,Mon Jul 28 16:33:53 2014 UTC,"Naturopaths are not real doctors, and may dissuade you from seeking appropriate medical care when it's warranted.

FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,FreyjaSunshine,0,Tue Jul 29 00:46:54 2014 UTC,"Here is a really good explanation of the differences between N.D. and M.D. degrees.  Here's another site (UMD's Medical Center, no less) discussing Naturopath Doctors, their schooling/testing, what an appointment will be like, and their licensing.  An article in HuffPo written by a Naturopath.  It would seem that there are N.D.s and N.M.D.s - I'm not certain I understand the difference, but then again I'm not a physician of any kind. I think, however, that when you referred before to Naturopaths what you really meant was not Naturopathy but Homeopathy."

FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,FreyjaSunshine,-1,Tue Jul 29 05:13:36 2014 UTC,"Well good for you! Being an M.D., I'm sure you understand the amount of work that a naturopath must also apply, considering they also must take MCATs, attend four years of med school, and a 1-3 year research fellowship in many cases. They are medical professionals, licensed in many states to practice medicine - it's just the kind of medicine that Galen or Hippocrates would have practiced, given they didn't have access to Glaxo's cabinet of goodies. Sorry for the competition, doc.  Your link is, simply, propaganda - period. Quackwatch? Yep, that's a decent source. Glad to see all that school helped you evaluate sources."
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,Super_Mommy,2,Tue Jul 29 05:42:04 2014 UTC,The difference is science.
FemmeThoughts,2by1nr,FreyjaSunshine,0,Tue Jul 29 06:02:52 2014 UTC,"Look you obviously feel really strongly about this and that's great, but it's no excuse to be unpleasant or snobbish. Obviously, Naturopaths are not the same as Medical Doctors and no one is trying to say your training is any less valuable. But that doesn't mean at all that Naturopaths don't do science - they do. They have a rigorous four-year curriculum. For comparison, here's Harvard Medical School's curriculum. They seem pretty similar to me. Sure, the Harvard courses are likely more challenging, because it's Harvard, but the same could be said about any two medical schools, no? So why the disrespect for the obviously complementary medical practitioners?   Naturopaths, to my understanding, tend to stick to the plant-based sources of many of the chemicals later used by pharmaceutical companies to develop medicine. A personal example - my sister is a clinical Herbalist (nothing like a doctor of any variety but the plant-based medicine she studies is pretty sound). She's taken pharmacology, and she understands interactions both between herbs and between herbs and pharmaceuticals. She had to perform a solid year of clinical work before getting her license (she's something like the analogy of a pharmacist). During her time in school she had to learn how to read journals. She goes a more bonkers route in that she believes you can make liquids have feelings by thinking at them, but she knows that's bonkers and has no basis in science.  If you have a cold, a naturopath may be able to help you. If you have cancer, you probably want to see an oncologist, which is why Naturopaths tend to be PCPs and not specialists or surgeons. In addition, Naturopaths tend to take a holistic rather than symptom-based view of health, meaning they will give a shit what's actually wrong with you rather than just treat your symptoms which, in my limited experience, M.D.s tend to do."

The aim isn't to help people with disabilities but to torture them into submission.  Electro-convulsive therapy is therapy. It's safe, it's not painful, and it's an actual medical treatment with a lot of good science behind it.  They are nothing alike and the suggestion is offensive."
FemmeThoughts,2bv3ro,real-dreamer,5,Sun Jul 27 21:37:25 2014 UTC,"I didn't read too far into the article. I apologize for the offense. I understand that it isn't much comfort and I assure everyone that wasn't my intention.   The comment I posted came out of ignorance and fear of electro convulsive therapy and certainly not expecting that something like this would be used in such a way.   Also, I'm still researching ECT. It's quite scary to think about and I assure you that I've had my thoughts of ECT not being too kind. I appreciate your teaching of me and once again I apologize. I'm sorry. Please forgive me."
FemmeThoughts,2bv3ro,REAL_CONSENT_MATTERS,3,Mon Jul 28 05:44:16 2014 UTC,"ECT has changed drastically over the past several decades, but even when it was awful, it still wasn't this barbaric.  In the future, please don't comment on articles you haven't read. Especially if they're about serious topics. If you don't know what you're talking about, it's easy to accidentally compare torture to medical treatment and those kinds of comparisons are harmful and offensive."
FemmeThoughts,2bv3ro,REAL_CONSENT_MATTERS,5,Mon Jul 28 06:59:43 2014 UTC,"ECT has changed drastically over the past several decades, but even when it was awful, it still wasn't this barbaric.   I'm not sure. ECT has caused permanent, long term damage to that has destroyed many people's lives. I'd rather have PTSD than PTSD and brain damage and involuntarily ECT is every bit as abusive.  Edit: For more information see ""Metamoprhis, Interrupted"" (""If insulin coma treatment is not a torture, nothing is..."") and the autobiographical book Insanity Inside Out for more information about ECT in the 50's and 60's. ETC is still sometimes used involuntarily."
FemmeThoughts,2bv3ro,REAL_CONSENT_MATTERS,1 point,Mon Jul 28 14:12:13 2014 UTC,"Okay, you're confusing a couple different things here.  Involuntary treatment does not make it torture. ECT is still sometimes used on patients who cannot or will not consent, but that doesn't make it torture.  ECT has completely transformed in recent decades. It's nothing like it was in the 60s. It's not even really anything like it was in the 80s. It's a fundamentally different treatment now and while it's a serious treatment, it's not torture. It's not even supposed to really be painful anymore.   ECT did used to be awful. Really, really awful. But it was not this barbaric.   And none of that has anything to do with voluntary vs. involuntary treatment. There are lots of normal medical procedures that aren't painful or harmful that are done without patient consent. And that has everything to do with how we recognise people as adults, and nothing to do with specifics of different medical treatments."
FemmeThoughts,2bt0xn,hermithome,1 point,Sat Jul 26 20:46:00 2014 UTC,"I agree to an extent--I hate that feminine things are demeaned, as a very feminine woman--but I don't think this is as healthy as the author seems to. It's implying that women's interests are fashion, child care, etc, when that is simply not the case. If the questions were more hard hitting, I'd say it's the start of something I really want--a woman's magazine that focuses on fashion, make up, etc, but also more serious topics. News, politics, science, business, etc from a woman's perspective, alongside other things we care about, would make me a very happy person."
FemmeThoughts,2bt0xn,neverwhere9,1 point,Tue Jul 29 02:22:27 2014 UTC,"Did you read the article? It doesn't imply that at all.  It also talks about (and links to another great article on) how these magazines have been covering more hard hitting stuff, and doing it well. It links to an article about how they've been covering the recent anti-abortion push in America and their coverage on this has been excellent.    It's massively insulting that you just assume that these magazines can't or won't cover these other issues well. And that the 'serious' women choosing these magazines to give big interviews to and choosing them because they're going to get soft questions about I don't, their beauty routines or something.  So maybe these magazines aren't the women's mag that you dream of, with a great balance of everything you're interested in. But that doesn't mean that they aren't doing some great coverage of politics, business and news.....even if it isn't as much as you'd like."
FemmeThoughts,2bt0xn,neverwhere9,1 point,Tue Jul 29 04:04:16 2014 UTC,"I did read the article, and I did think it implied that. I didn't read the linked article. I actually read these magazines, to be perfectly honest, and I don't find that they are covering hard hitting stuff. If anything, Seventeen's Life section covers more than the magazines for adults I read seem to.   Again, I read these magazines. A lot of them. So I'm not assuming anything. I'm reading it and they don't cover the issues well to be perfectly honest. It's not that I don't enjoy the magazines, but I don't think they're living up to their potential at all."
FemmeThoughts,2brps9,hermithome,6,Sat Jul 26 09:49:22 2014 UTC,"I did not even know that suspension was a thing in pre-schools. Shows what kind of neighborhood I grew up in, I guess."
FemmeThoughts,2brps9,lafayette0508,6,Sun Jul 27 04:53:07 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I didn't either. I grew up in a very well off town and I don't remember anyone getting suspended from preschool. I don't even think a child that young would fully understand a suspension."
FemmeThoughts,2brps9,LatrodectusVariolus,10,Sun Jul 27 19:41:55 2014 UTC,"As someone who went through something similar in my elementary school ""career,"" I can only hope the kids in his class don't see this as an open invitation to bully him like they did in my case. Shitty teachers/school administrators SUCK and it makes me so angry to see this happening to other kids, ESPECIALLY because of race.  I dunno if this is a conscious or unconscious phenomenon, but I can tell you that at least in my experience it was most definitely conscious. There are more than negligible amounts of people that get off on scapegoating children, and it's fucked up. Everyone who's seen as ""different"" in anyway (even just by being a different race or religion than the teachers/administrators) can tell you a story about a shit teacher that gave them hell for no reason. And it's shit like this that causes the worst cases of bullying too, not to mention making kids feel like they're worthless and coloring every interaction they have in the future."
FemmeThoughts,2brps9,ArsenicAndRoses,18,Sat Jul 26 17:32:23 2014 UTC,"I think everyone would benefit from reading the work of Daniel Kahneman. Basically, we all like to think that we are rational, logical, and unbiased, but what his work shows is that pretty much every decision we make is unconsciously influenced by cognitive biases. After all, it's not like our actions happen in a vacuum - we are all embedded in cultural and social structures which are often invisible to us. Given that black people (particularly black men) are more likely to be portrayed as violent and criminal in US popular culture, is it any surprise that this constant memetic barrage results in unconscious prejudice?  I think it's great that she has decided to tackle the problem head on by joining the parent's association and pushing for change and diversity training. Unfortunately I think she will find things difficult - as she points out, this is unlikely to be the result of conscious prejudice, but people don't tend to respond that well to having their prejudice, even if unconscious, pointed out, because we do like to trick ourselves into thinking that we are logical, rational, and unbiased."

FemmeThoughts,2brps9,bDgg,3,Mon Jul 28 00:47:35 2014 UTC,"I don't see how this comment adds any value to the conversation. Firstly, yes, plenty of people will be aware of cognitive biases, but many are not - certainly not ""everybody with a degree"", as many degree programmes will not cover cognitive biases, and furthermore  a number of people without degrees may also not know this. Secondly, I mentioned Daniel Kahneman specifically because he is one of the key figures in the field, and has recently written a very accessible book on his work, so if anyone did want to know more, they had a signpost.  Frankly, besides not contributing, your response comes across as condescending; just because you were already aware of this topic does not mean others are."

She doesn't need to provide the exact details of what each child did and what punishment they received and if she had, it would have been a pretty big privacy violation. She did provide the necessary details: her kids didn't really do anything to earn a suspension, other children behaved far worse (a child had to go to the ER) without punishment and the other parents were shocked that her children had been suspended.  We do not allow commenters to put victims on trial here. It doesn't matter if the author is a victim of rape or abuse or a biased system: victims are NOT on trial in this sub and you don't get to play devil's advocate or ask what the author excluded or lied about. The author presented statistics and studies that support her on this issue. You do not get to demand every tiny detail of her children's interactions in order to play judge."
FemmeThoughts,2brps9,lovesprunghate,16,Sat Jul 26 18:45:58 2014 UTC,"Separate from my mod comment which is official, I'm going to address one issue you raised.  It's a pretty minor offence for a 3 or 4 year old to throw a chair or to hit someone. Little kids misbehave. They have tantrums and sometimes that includes throwing a chair or hitting. I used to work with kids, so I can tell you that an occasional outburst is pretty freaking common. And one of the best ways to make it more common is to punish a little kid unfairly harshly.  A little kid throwing a chair is vastly different from an adult throwing a chair, remember that. They throw the tiny little dinky chairs, and sometimes they do it on accident: they're moving quickly, don't have great coordination and have a greater mass relation to a tiny chair than an adult has. It's bad behaviour sure, but it's normal bad behaviour. Same for a little kid punching, something that most often happens when an adult has already made contact and the kid is trying to get free (because they don't want to be cleaned up or whatever).  This type of behaviour generally has the teacher talking to the parent at the end of the day, or maybe calling home. A suspension is so far and away from how white children are treated and there's a boatload of evidence to back her up on this.  If you're shocked by a four year old throwing a chair or a three year old punching someone, then you don't know much about children."
FemmeThoughts,2brps9,lovesprunghate,2,Sat Jul 26 19:01:19 2014 UTC,"Perhaps I was just involved in zero-tolerance school systems for too long, then, because while the behavior for a kid isn't shocking (I never said it was), it does seem like a suspension worthy offense.  That might be my personal prejudice, however.  So does throwing something at another kid, but again, the author never clarifies anything, let alone clarifies if the child was actually hurt, or if the E.R. trip was just a preventative measure.  I think I also might have been unclear in my original comment, for what it's worth.  This:   Same for a little kid punching, something that most often happens when an adult has already made contact and the kid is trying to get free   Is almost exactly what I was worried about.  She provides commentary on her kids having a stable home life and no behavioral problems (which I believe).  If her kids only act out in one specific environment, the likely catalyst would seem to be the environment itself.  Rather than focusing on the fairness or unfairness of the punishment, it seems like the more startling but ignored problem would be what is it that is specifically happening in this environment that is provoking aggressive behavior."
FemmeThoughts,2brps9,Shmaesh,11,Sat Jul 26 19:09:29 2014 UTC,"So is throwing something at another kid, but again, the author never clarifies anything, let alone clarifies if the child was actually hurt, or if the E.R. trip was just a preventative measure.   Again, look at your assumptions. You're assuming that there are mitigating circumstances/additional details in favour of the other children who misbehaved and against her children. That's incredibly toxic. The facts as we know them are that her children misbehaved, by throwing chairs and by punching. Other children misbehaved by throwing things, and the worst that happened was a phone call home. Even when someone else was injured/hit and needed to go to the ER (preventative or not). Despite mountains of statistical evidence and her own experiences growing up, this mother trusted the school's assessment until she spoke with other parents who revealed enormous differences in how their children were treated and who were shocked by the punishment's her children received. This mother already assumed good faith, and assumed that the school her children were in was magically free from this sort of bias--despite all the statistical evidence and studies that show that the probability of her children receiving fair treatment is pretty small.   You're going past assuming good faith on the part of the school, you're assuming bad faith on the part of the mother. You're assuming that she is intentionally twisting the facts or leaving out details that would justify the school's actions. You need to stop doing this.  No, of course we can't prove conclusively what happened. But that's true of every article where the author relays personal experiences. They could be misremembering, or carefully selecting their words to imply things in their favour or outright lying. But this is not a court of law and we are not deciding who to punish and how.   I'm letting this comment stand because it's one line, and you raised other issues worthy of discussion, but I'm serious, do not do this again."

FemmeThoughts,2brps9,real-dreamer,9,Sat Jul 26 19:46:32 2014 UTC,"This is not a matter of disagreement, it's a matter of sub policy. Attempting to dissect a person's IRL story that you have no way of verifying and will never have a way of verifying is invalidating and derailing. Imagine if this weren't a story about racial bias but was instead about gender bias. The victims aren't two little boys unfairly suspended, the victim is a young woman. She's writing about her school's policies for handling rape. She reported being assaulted and got a suspension for slandering a student and violating the school's morality clause. The details about her rape are sparse, she's chosen not to include them. Maybe she finds it traumatising to mention the details or maybe she thinks they don't matter because she want to focus on sexist policies. She wants people to pay attention to the statistics and studies she cites, not attempt to try her case online.   When posted to this sub, people decided that they want to view the piece ""critically"". They wonder why their are details missing, and pour over every word she used, trying to determine whether or not she was actually raped. Yes, the commenters say, ""rape is a real problem and colleges handle it badly and all the statistics and studies she included are true....but what about this case? We must view this critically.""  That is what you are doing here. You are invalidating the author's lived experiences in order to defend nameless, faceless people who face no punishment. And you are derailing. The issue at hand is a racist school to prison pipeline, not litigating the exact details of how this school punished these boys.  This is not a matter of opinion, it's a matter of sub policy. This behaviour is always unacceptable, and any other moderator would have treated your comments the same way. In fact, I very carefully left you multiple replies, so that my moderator comments reminding you of the rules did not also contain my disagreements with the opinions you voiced."
FemmeThoughts,2brps9,fyrenwater,7,Sat Jul 26 20:04:16 2014 UTC,"Perhaps I was just involved in zero-tolerance school systems for too long, then, because while the behavior for a kid isn't shocking (I never said it was), I do think that it's a suspension-worthy offense.    Really? When you were in preschool students either behaved perfectly or were regularly suspended? If this kinda punishment scheme had been going when I was in preschool, there would have been a kid suspended every day. Little kids shove and push and throw and punch.....sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally. When they do, they are taken aside, told why the behaviour is wrong, what other behaviour choices they have and then stuck in a time out. And that was the approach when I worked with little kids too. I find it hard to imagine a preschool where children are suspended any time they do anything violent, intentional or not.   If her kids only act out in one specific environment, the likely catalyst would seem to be the environment itself. Rather than focusing on the fairness or unfairness of the punishment, it seems like the more startling but ignored problem would be what is it that is specifically happening in this environment that is provoking aggressive behavior.   Well, first, I'd posit that the bias of the school and teachers might not just be to blame for the drastically more severe punishments, but for the behaviour as well. And even if it's not, it's likely intertwined. The teachers see the boys as troublemakers/criminals and therefore they treat them that way. Of course that affects how the boys behave and provokes aggressive behaviour. If they behave well, they likely aren't rewarded, but treated with suspicious as though  though it's only a matter of time before they slip up. If they have a bad day, they are punished harshly. The teachers likely smile at them less and are less empathetic.   But either way, the punishments are the real issue here. They go on a school record that will follow her boys around. If they are applying to private schools, it could affect their chances of getting in. If they go to public schools, teachers read the records before seeing the students, and it will likely influence them to see the children as troublemakers, and treat them differently from the beginning. Her oldest is a year away from kindergarten, where a suspension (even for a non-violent offence like wearing socks of the wrong height) could land him in jail. The punishment aspect of this is absolutely important, because it leads to jail, and a life of incarceration.  Systemic bias follows you around in a way that a year or two in a school that isn't the best environment does not."

I was bullied at school, mostly by girls, so I always see myself as the lowest in the food chain as it were, not one of the cool kids. So if I don't get invited, that's it. I also have no idea how to hang out with girls. With my guy friends it's just, wanna watch a dvd or go to the pub and chat. With girls, it just feels like it needs to be so much more organised, or something girly like shopping. But that's probably me just totally misunderstanding my own sex.  I think if I didn't know B, I wouldn't have been at all upset at A hanging out with her and not inviting me. But because we're supposed to be the same friendship group, I've always felt pretty left out when they always hang out. In fact, I knew B a bit longer, or at least a bit better because A moved to the area about a year after B (although we still all knew each other vaguely through their other halves).  Ah, I need to stop assuming people don't want to hang out with me. It's been ingrained into me from a young age.  I might take a look at that Girl Gamer's sub, thanks for mentioning it!

FemmeThoughts,2bry03,stumbleuponlife,5,Mon Jul 28 18:40:51 2014 UTC,"I read something once that said that certain personality types are so good at reading other people's emotions and states of being that they're hyper-vigilant about how they affect others.  Maybe it was an introvert/extrovert thing, I'm not totally sure, but it sounds about right.  Extroverts (maybe?), on the other hand, aren't any good at that, so they don't go about analyzing every aspect of their selves.  They just do as they do, and don't pay attention to if what they are saying or doing affects others in microscopic ways.  Now, I don't know how accurate this is - probably no more accurate than any other intro/extro analysis, but I find it rings true in my own life.  I'm constantly worried about my own behaviour and how it affects the people in my life that I'm like water, taking on the shape of whatever misplaced concerns restrict me.  My super-extroverted cousin, however, doesn't give a single thought as to how her behaviour affects others, and wouldn't you know it, she has tons of people flocking to spend time with her, even if they don't really like her.  She's magnetic in the way that she draws people to her, even if she constantly offends them every time they meet.  I genuinely can't explain it except to say that it must be because she has no qualms about being herself.  What does any of this have to do with you?  Try not to care if you think you weirded A out.  If you did, you did. If you didn't, you didn't. But all in all (in my anonymous internet person opinion), I don't think these are good friends, and you aren't doing yourself any favours by trying to get in good with them.  Even if A is a really fantastic person, really! She's taking you for granted and uses you at her own convenience and that's not fair.  Of course, I could be wrong here, I've only got your side of the story.  Maybe you got her and her dude a really weird gift and you really weirded her out.  Also totally fine!  Own it, be weird!  If that's you, then that's you and it's wonderful.  But from where I see it, you're devoting too much time to what she may or may not think of you when you really should be thinking about what awesome things you're going to do for the rest of this beautiful summer!

It's kind of the norm that the internet is male dominated. It's not something that needs to be worked on and fixed; nothing's ""wrong"" when a site's traffic is primarily men. But when a site is really appealing to women, for some reason the big question is ""how do we get men?"" It's not enough to expand the current user base by advertising to people who you know will already like the content. Because it feels like you're missing the main demographic of the internet - the men! So it feels like if you're not attracting the main internet users, something us wrong.

We can also support this empirically; studies show that when sent identical CVs, with only the name of the candidate changed (one version an obviously male name, one an obviously female), the male version of the CV is more likely to be pursued.  Honestly, recruitment is rampant with sexism, racism and ageism. Yes, there are laws against discrimination, but that requires that you can prove you were discriminated against - so if a hiring manager tells you, ""sorry, we don't hire women"" then you have a case. What happens in practice, is they just bin your application with no explanation beyond a stock email stating that your application is not being proceeded with (if they even bother to send that). This is also why hiring managers are so reluctant to give candidates feedback on how they interviewed and why they were turned down; the risk of being sued for something which may be construed as discrimination (whether valid or not) is too high!"

FemmeThoughts,2br3k7,katbun,7,Sat Jul 26 18:26:02 2014 UTC,"Another option is just giving her initials with her surname - I remember seeing a study suggesting that blinding it like that could be a bit more successful, as it eliminates the unconscious prejudice a hiring manager might experience on seeing a female name. Actively misspelling the name could cause a problem in its own right; hiring managers hate spelling mistakes and spelling your own name wrong would prejudice the hiring manager against you once they found out.  Good luck to her! It is tough out there, but there are some very good, easily google-able resources for new grads out there on how to find your first job."

That shouldn't be a problem for her, just another example of the discrimination you see in hiring!"

FemmeThoughts,2breph,wiscondinavian,1 point,Sat Jul 26 19:53:38 2014 UTC,"ahh I have diagnosed OCD and I think that contributes  to it because I can't stand uncomfy clothing.  I just never feel like my bra gives proper support because my boobs sit high on my chest and the underwire never sits right under the boob. It sits too low down and I never get enough support.  But for the under wire to be high enough, the band would have to be abnormally high on my back and I dont think bras are supposed to fit that way either.  Am I just going to have to spend like 80 bucks on a bra ordered from the internet? It's frustrating that everything like that is so expensive"
FemmeThoughts,2breph,Lordica,2,Wed Jul 30 18:58:33 2014 UTC,"No!!! I'm a 30G, and while I do buy online (I don't live in the US), the most I have EVER paid for a bra was $40, and that's because it was strapless and I reeeeeally wanted a specific bra. I generally pay $10-20 for bras from figleaves.com/US  If you live in the US, you could buy online from Amazon or Nordstrom for pretty good prices, and easier returns than figleaves (which is based in the UK). Nordstrom also has physical stores around the US, but they aren't everywhere.  If the bra is sitting too low under your breasts, that probably means that the band is too big. If you want, you can post your measurements on /r/abrathatfits, and those lovely ladies can help you find a better fitting bra :)  For example, I measure 29"" underbust, 27"" when I pull very tight, and about 39"" around my breasts. From the 29"" and 27"" measurements I could use a 28"" or 30"" band. I prefer the 30"" band. Then, 39""-30"" = 9"". So 9"" difference. A=1"", B=2"", C=3"", D=4"", DD=5"", E=6"", F=7"", FF=8"", G=9"". Therefore, 30G!  /r/abrathatfits uses a total of 5 measurements, but just getting your underbust and your breast measurement gives you a pretty good starting point."

If I do the measurements correctly, is there a fairly good chance that I can sucessfully find a fitting bra online without trying it on before buying it (since I'd have to order online)?"

Our bodies are aging/changing each and every day, that's just a fact of life.  There is so much more to being a person, a partner, a friend etc. than your body.    and sometimes it bothers me that my body isn't perfect   I'm going to assume that you are very young because of what you wrote so I'm not going to call you superficial although that's what you're sounding like.    Of course you should eat right, exercise and take care of your body, but being concerned about not being 'perfect' is silly - no one is 'perfect.'  What's important is who you are and how you develop yourself emotionally to be the best person/woman you can be.  This obsession with physical attributes decreases as you get older.  Look, I'm in my 50's and of course I enjoy looking at a man with a nice body, it does not however affect who he is as a person once he starts talking.   but I assume they arent big enough to get the reduction surgery covered by insurance   Don't assume.  If you're seriously considering this possibility, you need to see a doctor for an actual medical consultation and then you need to speak to the insurance company."

FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,Fairleee,24,Fri Jul 25 16:29:49 2014 UTC,"My wife breastfeeds, as do most of our circle of parenting friends. We've spoken about this before, and almost everyone has a story of facing disapproval for breastfeeding in a public place, either direct (someone telling them off), or indirect (overhearing nasty comments, people pulling disapproving faces etc.). It is rare, but when it happens it can be very upsetting. Anecdotally I have noticed that women are more likely to say something disapproving, and men more likely to look disapproving, but I cannot back that up with any studies, so that may not be true in general.  I attended a feminist conference recently and there were a number of papers given on the concept of ""respectable femininity"". Within the literature, what this argues is that as women are far more likely to be treated as archetypes of their gender than men are (like that XKCD comic, when a man is bad at maths it's because he's bad at maths, but when a woman is bad at maths it's because women are bad at maths), there is a strong coercive pressure for women to police not only themselves, but other women too, to make sure that respectable femininity is maintained, because a disreputable woman essentially brings all women into disrepute. Given that breasts are hyper-sexualised in the UK (probably true for most of the western world), a woman breastfeeding in public could make some women uncomfortable simply because it is appearing to violate respectable femininity. If course, then you have to address the hypocrisy that a woman breastfeeding is somehow scandalous, but Page 3 girls, giant images of semi-naked women outside clothes shops etc. is socially accepted and seen as normal! So yeah, breastfeeding in public is just another one of those double binds that women face and have to try and negotiate. Luckily there are a lot of ground roots movements trying to address this, and normalise it - my city recently held a ""feed-in"" in a large high street shop which had told a breastfeeding woman in one of their branches to leave. Breastfeeding is a choice, but it is a normal, natural, ""clean"" (i.e. Not dirty or shameful) part of the human experience and should not be discriminated against.  Anyhow, to lighten the mood a bit, here is a wonderful and funny song satirising the anti-public breastfeeding attitude - Ruin Your Day With Tits!"
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,Grave_Girl,12,Fri Jul 25 18:01:39 2014 UTC,"Anecdotally I have noticed that women are more likely to say something disapproving, and men more likely to look disapproving, but I cannot back that up with any studies, so that may not be true in general.   This has actually been my experience as well, though the worst tangle I ever got into someone over breastfeeding was a man (and an Episcopal priest; what it boiled down to was he had horrible manners around breastfeeding women and thought it was OK and normal to stare at them, so someone else treating me rudely during the service--a laid-back affair during which people would routinely eat, drink, and bottle-feed babies--was my fault).    I think your idea about respectable femininity is obviously right on.  The confusion about breasts and sexuality arises again and again; a good number of people cannot wrap their heads around a body part having a sexual use and a nonsexual use (even though this is true even of our sex organs!).  There is a mention of public breastfeeding in another subreddit today where OP made the claim that if women can bare their breasts to feed their babies, he ought to be able to walk around with his penis out because arousal is natural."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,Fairleee,13,Fri Jul 25 19:22:48 2014 UTC,"Ugh, the old ""my penis is the same as a pair of breasts"" false analogy - I hate that one, although the ""wee and poo are natural and I don't do that in the street"" is worse.  The thing about the first one is that it is essentially making the assumption that women are getting their breasts out for other people - kind of unsurprising, given that generally when you see a pair of breasts it is for cishet male titillation (the whole ""male gaze"" thing). When you unpack it, it just goes to show how much the female body is assumed to be some kind of public property, free for anyone to look at and comment on. My general response to people who say that is to firstly ask them if they genuinely want to walk around in public with their willies out (they usually don't), and secondly to remind them that a woman breastfeeding is not doing it for anyone other than her baby - she isn't asking you to look! Seriously, bodily autonomy should not be something that we have to teach to adults. For the wee/poo comparisons, I generally ask them if they can explain the similarities between urine, excrement and breastmilk. The ONLY similarity is that all three come out of the body; two are waste products, one is not. That is the key difference. You've also then got the retort that as adults, you would assume that they were potty-trained as children, and can therefore hold it in until they find a toilet, whereas forcing a hungry baby to wait (who is quite possibly already screaming from hunger) is pretty inhumane.  Ultimately, though, you are unlikely to change anyone's minds with those arguments, because it does require a level of introspection, and the ability to question your beliefs - ""why do I think public breastfeeding is disgusting? What is disgusting about it?"" - and from that point start to unpack the fact that any revulsion you feel is a social construct, not a ""normal"" response (indeed, feeling revolted by the sight of a female nourishing her child is, from a biological perspective, not a normal response!). I think the only real way to change things is to really encourage more women to do it. Once it becomes normalised, it ceases to shock. In cultures where breastfeeding is very normal, it does not elicit a response (or if it does  the response is usually positive). Of course, that's not an easy thing to do!"
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,keakealani,4,Fri Jul 25 20:34:22 2014 UTC,"Interestingly, I think there's a bit of a feedback loop about breasts being linked to sexuality. Because public breastfeeding is discouraged, a larger proportion of breast-related imagery seen in public is sexualized (since lingerie advertisements and the like are not at all discouraged). Then, because sexualized breast imagery is common, it furthers the stereotype and fuels the discouragement of breastfeeding.   I often think one of the biggest ways to combat this really would be to saturate the public consciousness with breastfeeding images, until that became more of a norm than the sexualized images. Whether it's ""feed-ins"" like you describe, or PSA-style billboards/ads posted in public places, people just need to normalize the idea that boobs can be out and about without being about the sexy part."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,Fairleee,6,Fri Jul 25 21:19:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've always felt this cartoon sums up pretty nicely the hypocrisy regarding societal attitudes towards the female breast. Breastfeeding is becoming a bit more normalised, but still a long way to go!"
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,Fairleee,9,Fri Jul 25 22:30:07 2014 UTC,"I have come across the concept of respectable femininity before (although I didn't know it was called that) in the context of women slut-shaming other women.

I even tried pumping non stop and I was just getting blood in the bottles from my nipples cracking. While I've never faced the criticism that mothers who breastfeed in public get, I have been openly shamed for formula feeding. It's become a lose/lose situation, but the truth is we all have one common goal, keeping our babies well fed and happy.   I don't think any woman feeding a baby,  regardless of how they're doing it, should ever have to feel ashamed. It seems like everyone has their own opinion of what is right and wrong or what is appropriate, and feel obligated to give you their opinion. It's simple though really, I'm feeding my baby because he's hungry. I've seen just as much, if not more boob on TV or walking by victorias secret than I've seen on a mother breastfeeding.   I do know one thing for certain. I would not want to eat in a bathroom stall, or in a hot car, or with a blanket shoved over my head. Also, while I don't have experience with this, so please correct me if I'm wrong, but I've heard that when your boobs are ready for the baby to feed they can become engorged and putting off feeding can be very painful. I know some woman bring a pump to work and pump into bottles to remedy that situation, but not everyone wants to do that because using a bottle can affect them latching to an actual nipple."

But the important thing is that you have a happy, healthy baby :)   I've seen just as much, if not more boob on TV or walking by victorias secret than I've seen on a mother breastfeeding.   This is exactly what I think. Oh, that enhanced boob in sheer underwear that's not leaving anything to the imagination, on that billboard advertising some lingerie brand, is fine?

I had pretty bad ppd and I was so ashamed that I couldn't perform a basic female function and feed my baby. It was a very difficult time for me, and I felt like less of a woman because of it. Being accused of not trying hard enough, or being lazy or selfish made it so much worse.   I'd never want to feel that shame again, and I hate seeing it happen to other women. I feel like once a week I'm reading a story of a breastfeeding mother being asked to leave a restaurant or other public place. So what breast is best until you have to see it? Boobs on actresses or super models, totally cool! Boobs doing what they are meant to do and nourish a child, omg ew gross go sit in the bathroom!   Plus so many new mothers deal with things like ppd or feeling isolated and cooped up. Going to dinner might be the first time they've been out with their SO or family, and they're forced into the bathroom to feed their baby alone? Ugh I just can't wrap my head around it sometimes.   I seriously doubt that woman felt completely comfortable breastfeeding in the middle of a meeting, but we don't know her situation. Maybe she was uncomfortably engorged. Maybe she did what we all do sometines as mothers and put her babies needs before her own, even though it wasn't the ideal situation. Maybe she is following a very strict schedule and doesn't want to start skipping feedings and risk losing supply?

When my milk didn't come in at all when I was leaving the hospital I asked ""what if it never does?"" All the nurses were like ""don't even think about that, I bet it comes in tomorrow morning!""   When I asked for formula just in case for some reason it didn't,  they were convinced I wouldn't need it, and that having it in the house might tempt me to use it instead of continuing to try to breast feed. Thankfully I had one awesome nurse who snuck me a few samples to take home. It was really sad how secretive it had to be though.  Like I said thankfully I had it because my son was just screaming non stop. I knew he was starving and I knew he was getting nothing from me. I gave him formula and be calmed right down.

FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,wookiewookiewhat,2,Fri Jul 25 18:57:16 2014 UTC,"I keep finding you in many of my favorite subreddits.  You always have lovely, reasonable comments.  I bet your patients just love you!    Sorry, I'm not trying to stalk too much, but you are awesome and you stick out.    On the topic, though, I definitely agree with you.  There is a time and a place for everything, and a business meeting doesn't seem like the time to eat lunch, no matter if you are 2 months old or 22 years old."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,breadfollowsme,6,Fri Jul 25 21:00:23 2014 UTC,"I would say both of those depend very much on the type of office one works in. E.g. people where I work often have meetings over lunch where people bring their sandwiches or whatever, so your second point wouldn't be applicable."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,wookiewookiewhat,6,Fri Jul 25 22:02:27 2014 UTC,"There are offices where babies, pets, etc are welcome. Probably not many large corporate ones, but there are certainly smaller businesses that are more liberal.  If it's OK to breastfeed at the office in general, IMO a meeting shouldn't be much different."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,JotainPinkki,1 point,Fri Jul 25 21:09:29 2014 UTC,"Well then in those offices with pets and children running around, breastfeeding in a business meeting is probably fine.  But surely you don't think that's the norm."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,DefinitelyNotFreud,3,Fri Jul 25 19:30:03 2014 UTC,"Frankly, if they were OK with the baby being brought to the office at all, there's no good reason to not be OK with feeding the baby while she's there. I mean, would having a screaming, hungry baby in a meeting somehow be more appropriate?"
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,ResistEntropy,2,Fri Jul 25 20:26:23 2014 UTC,"I think that if the baby was welcome in the meeting then it was appropriate for the baby to eat there. The fact that you wouldn't eat during a meeting is a little beside the point because a baby can't wait to eat like you can. I think it's a little odd to bring a baby into a business meeting, but it sounds like it was okay in this particular company."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,twistedfork,1 point,Sat Jul 26 03:47:36 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah! Most companies aren't okay with employees bringing babies into work! And that's completely legitimate. I just think that if you allow a baby in an area, the you are consenting to their needs being met in that area - assuming it is safe and sanitary to do so."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,ResistEntropy,2,Sun Jul 27 04:24:00 2014 UTC,"I feel the same way if it's a more formal meeting. If the mom knows what time the meeting is she could have the meeting scheduled around feeding time. Not because it's shameful, just because it's something extra taking away focus from the meeting.  Often at my work we'll have small meetings of a manager, a designer and a developer. That probably wouldn't be such a big deal for such an informal meeting.   Our project manager brought her baby in the office for the few weeks between when her maternity leave ended (she got a pitiful four weeks) and when the baby had his shots and was able to go to day care. He slept in the conference room when we had meetings and most of the time he snoozed quietly, but sometimes he'd fuss or poop or have a complete meltdown and it derailed the meeting entirely. Babies and work do not mix."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,Grave_Girl,2,Tue Jul 29 00:52:57 2014 UTC,"I would also add the caveat that it is impolite to breastfeed in a situation where other people cannot remove themselves if they feel uncomfortable. Outside? Absolutely. No one is being forced to sit right there and interact with you. In an office? Maybe, it depends on how much space there is and how flexible things are in general. In a closed door meeting? No. If anyone in the room felt uncomfortable by it for whatever reason, they could not leave without hurting their career. We shouldn't lose all politeness and thoughtfulness because it should be ok to breastfeed anywhere."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,LatrodectusVariolus,2,Tue Jul 29 02:26:35 2014 UTC,"I guess I don't understand why the baby's need to eat is less important than an adults arbitrary desire to feel ""comfortable."" What other actions are held to this standard? It makes breastfeeding into something abnormal or extraordinary that people should have special rights pertaining to it. Should a baby only be fed a bottle under the circumstances that there's no one in the room that would feel uncomfortable with it? It's just a strange distinction to me."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,LatrodectusVariolus,1 point,Fri Jul 25 20:26:51 2014 UTC,"To be fair, I did make the distinction that it would be the polite thing to allow people the ability to leave, not the required thing to do.   Manners should be guided by making sure others are comfortable, including both adults and babies - it's the kind thing to do and is involved in all aspects of life, from holding a door open to not wearing a Speedo to work (unless you're Michael Phelps). If there's going to be an important meeting during a regular feeding time and you don't want to or cannot use bottle feeding from a babysitter, it might be a good idea to ask to Skype in, reschedule the meeting, or step out. I'm not going to persecute anyone who chooses to breastfeed in a meeting, because oftentimes these choices aren't easy or equal, but it's not a bad thing to think about how to mitigate a situation to make sure everyone is comfortable."
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,MarthaGail,3,Sat Jul 26 02:45:08 2014 UTC,I still think that bringing a baby to the meeting or work is inappropriate.   I'm OK with breastfeeding in public settings though.
FemmeThoughts,2bpc4w,MarthaGail,7,Sun Jul 27 04:27:31 2014 UTC,"Different cultures have different ideas about modesty, and open. public breastfeeding seems to be bringing these differences to the forefront of discussion and debate. If your friend's cultural background leads her to feel uncomfortable with open, public breastfeeding that's okay. We don't all have to love it, but we do have to respect the rights of other people. As long as she doesn't interfere with it she's entitled to her own feelings.  Unless the office had a specific policy where it's okay for people to bring babies in, or the women with the baby was the owner and thus could do whatever she wants, I think it's inappropriate to have a baby in the workplace regardless of breastfeeding. I also agree with whoever said it's distracting to have a baby in a business meeting, breastfeeding or not. A bathroom seems like a cumbersome and uncomfortable place to do it, but I don't see why shouldn't couldn't have left the meeting and done it in her office or cubicle."

How much hubris does it take to be able to think ""I would never harass a person like that so it doesn't happen/must be exaggerated"" or ""I've never recieved that kind of harassment so it doesn't happen/must be exaggerated"". Denying women's stories of abuse and intimidation is tacit endorsement of the harassment. How about instead of dismissing other people's reality, understand that everyone has unique, varied and valid life experiences. I don't think that's too hard. But then again, that type of thinking is based on respect and equality...maybe the dismissers just plain don't respect women. Mindblowing, I know.

Why should a man ""be willing to change [his] surname and treat this as a preferable option to [his] spouse changing hers?""  I think everybody has a right to keep their own name if they want to, and if two people want the same surname but can't come to an agreement, it shouldn't come down to ""well, I'm the man so we'll just use mine because tradition"" or ""I'm the woman, so we'll just use mine because sexism.""   I feel like better advice would be something more along the lines of ""don't expect/pressure her to change her name, and be open to the idea of changing yours."""
FemmeThoughts,2begsw,Sigh_No_More,10,Tue Jul 22 22:31:50 2014 UTC,"There are a few in this I don't agree, and that one's at the top of the list.   For example, doing 50% of the housework. That's great, if you and your partner are working equal hours. But in many relationships, that's not the case, so a trade-off is that the person who works less does more of the housework. I don't see why that should be a problem.   Additionally, paying for contraception. Either split it fifty-fifty, or split the costs according to income makes a lot more sense to me. I want to have sex as well, and I feel it's fair to go fifty-fifty on contraception, rather than making my partner pay for all of it."
FemmeThoughts,2begsw,candydaze,2,Wed Jul 23 05:13:48 2014 UTC,I agree with your analysis. I will say though that using that as a hypothetical would be a great way to make people realize how unfair it is though. There were a lot of points on this list that when I read them I thought it was wrong and unfair and unjust etc etc and then I had a lightbulb go off in my brain where I suddenly realized and felt just how ingrained and nasty the sexism is in our lives.

FemmeThoughts,2bd021,AppleSpicer,15,Tue Jul 22 03:15:16 2014 UTC,"So, I'm just here to comment on one thing in particular that jelliknight briefly touched upon because I think it'll make you feel loads better (because it made me feel better too when I first learned of it): female marines aren't required to do any pull ups for their physical requirements. Instead they do something called a flexed-arm hang.  I learned about this via this woman who was actually in the marines. If you really don't want to watch the first 2:45 of the video, TL:DR:  males were required to do at least three pull ups and females were required to do the flex-arm hang for at least fifteen seconds. She then stated that while while the women were generally worse at pull ups than the men, the men were also generally worse at arm hangs than the women.  So I would recommend you follow the guidelines in my first link and try out some arm hangs! If you can work yourself up to five seconds, you'll be doing better than some male marines! The hangs may even result in a baby step for you to eventually do a pull up! You can do it!!!"

I knew that female marines had different standards (aren't they changing that?) but didn't know that they surpassed male marines for the flexed arm hang!   I followed someone else's post about a woman's journey to do a pullup and bought a stretchy band assist. I'm going to practice that fucker until I can do a bunch. Right now arm hangs and slow lowering are my stepping stone.

Have you flat out told him that it makes you feel like shit because you have to pay attention to your limitations? It's a real health issue to push yourself beyond what your body is capable of when you have limited abilities. Basically, I went through something like this and eventually just said this sucks and here is why and you need to stop because it's crazy-making. Even if he knows logically that you can't do what he is suggesting, it might help to be very blunt."
FemmeThoughts,2bd021,dedededede,5,Tue Jul 22 05:17:00 2014 UTC,Thanks for the advice. You articulated what frustrated me so much earlier. I'll focus on this in our conversation.
FemmeThoughts,2bd021,I_fight_demons,8,Tue Jul 22 05:51:13 2014 UTC,"Never try to discuss diets and workout etc. with you partner unless you really know what you are doing :).   At least this is my experience. My wife often wants to loose some weight and there was a time I tried to help her by giving her tips. This always led to very unhealthy mechanisms in our relationship. She felt shitty, controlled and monitored while I unfortunately began to use my ""help"" as a vent against her (of course this happened mostly subconsciously). This was very bad for the ""balance of power"" in our relationship. It took much time and escalation to regenerate from this... I now only support by showing my appreciation for her progress. This is better for both of us.   When you want help from your partner be sure he/she can deal with the vulnerability you expose. When it's a topic where you are not vulnerable at all this is no problem otherwise it can lead to sorrows on both sides.  PS: Many women can't do pull ups and it's totally normal. There are reasons for special workouts for women. I would recommend you to go to a professional trainer that is not your partner."
FemmeThoughts,2bd021,CaptainAirstripOne,3,Tue Jul 22 07:56:54 2014 UTC,Thank you for this advice. I've since talked to my partner and asked him to never give me advice about diet and exercise unless I specifically ask for it (though I think I'll avoid ever opening that can of worms). He seemed pretty disappointed but understands why it's necessary.   After some research I bought a stretchy band pull up assist and I'm going to work on pull ups!

SO might be a great guy--he probably is since he's encouraging you to do things that he thinks will make you healthier in the long run.  He's just crap at the way he encourages you to do it (probably because he doesn't know another way).    I'm in the same boat as you. I have back issues and joint issues and can't do a lot of the things I'd like to do. My original goal was to run a 5k. Discovered that scoliosis = no running for me. Felt like shit for days.  I had to find alternative things to do and other ways to push myself.  Your SO might be reading your ""I cannot physically do that!"" as an excuse--explain it's not, maybe work out other ways to exercise together. There are LOTS of ways to get fit, so choose one that works for you.   Also, if your SO doesn't listen to reason on this, tell him to shut his trap until he's a certified trainer AND nutritionist.  I've seen both. There's lots of ways to get fit.  Doing things your body isn't ready for will result in injury, not fitness.   (And the being told you're wrong thing, the guilt trip thing...those things are awful. My husband has done the latter to me and I HATE it. Of course I still love him, but damn he needs to work on his approach to discussions of exercise.)  So don't necessarily dump your guy. Talk to him about how he's being neither motivational nor helpful.  PS: If you want a fun and motivational way to get yourself moving (and effectively shut down conversation while doing so), I recommend the ""Zombies, Run!"" app. It's a pay app (and no, I'm not affiliated) and takes you through a serialized radio drama in a post-apocalyptic settlement of zombie survivors. Despite its name, you don't have to run. I walk and have improved my speed significantly (from avg of 3.4 to avg of 3.8mph. Goal is 4.0). It'll queue your playlist for between story bits AND you get to build and defend a zombie base. Hella fun and gets my butt down to the treadmill regularly. Just my two cents."

'Yeah, I can't do squats because of my knees' sounds much less positive than 'I'm not sure my knees can handle squats, I was going to focus on making sure I can walk 40 minutes at a good pace as my first goal' or 'pull ups may take awhile, I was thinking of doing supine rows until I get my upper body strength up and weight down more.'"

He is also not her trainer or her coach, and he shouldn't try to be. That's asking for trouble, as her story clearly demonstrates.

I'm not saying she doesn't have limits--she does and they're very real. I'm saying that her guy is operating from a rather unrealistic and under educated stance when it comes to fitness and that his inability to recognize his own ignorance in this one area (and we all have at least one area, right?) is no reason to dump him.    I just think that leaping to a response of ""ditch the guy"" after a report of a single flaw is something that all of us do too often in the more female centered posts on Reddit.

If he's insulting her, degrading her, and constantly undermining her self-confidence in other areas as well that's a different story...but it sounds like this is an issue that's solvable with some open and blunt communication as well as with the OP finding a workout system that works for her and sticking to it."

I'm particularly crabby about the situation and you've hit some hot buttons. Oh and I don't lack lack assertiveness. I assure you I practice regularly.   Step 1: You don't understand what it is to be an extremely competitive person or to live with one. Competitiveness and stubbornness is something neither of us can let go. Also, his sex doesn't make him automatically better at all physical activity either.   Step 2: You're right that I need to work on my self confidence. My SO is absolutely tactless and usually I'm unfazable but in the rare areas where my self confidence is weak he gets through pretty bad. That's my flaw to work on, not his. Though I would appreciate if he wouldn't shit on physical activities I'm not able to do. My self confidence is based around my competitive spirit.  Step 3: I need his support for diet because I'm not healthy enough to regularly cook for myself. I suffer from a chronic condition and if my SO didn't cook for me I sometimes wouldn't eat. This is probably a huge reason I'm suddenly gaining weight after years of stability. This condition also causes me to skip out on exercise so it would be nice if he were encouraging though it's my own responsibility.   Step 4: I would like to ask a fitness support group, though I would ideally like advice specific to my medical condition. I'll probably post there sometime with more in depth specifics. I need find some way to stay on a routine."
FemmeThoughts,2bd021,jelliknight,6,Tue Jul 22 12:56:30 2014 UTC,"Step 4?  Definitely hit up your doctor.  BF can't argue with doctor, no matter how much he'd like to try.  And, while he does think he's helping,  you've got lay down the law in letting him know HE'S NOT HELPING.  No suggestions, no coaching, no ""helpful tips""...nothing.  Let him know you can't handle it, and if he won't stop doing it, get up and leave the room when he tries.  There's a reason people who are married to trainers very, very rarely enlist the professional services of their spouses.  What he thinks is motivational and helpful comes across as hurtful and spiteful.  Tell him you won't let him ruin your will to workout like that anymore.  The end."

I have extra stretchy ligaments which contribute to the joint weakness and also cause back problems which can be managed by strengthening it. And I have cluster migraines which are triggered by almost all forms of exercise. One of the problem symptoms is getting an incredibly strong aura of colors, sparkles, and shapes overlaying my view. I also feel nauseous and it injects pain straight into my head. I always get this with running, sometimes with walking, never with swimming. If I push at all with weights I get it but if I just go through a really really light set it isn't so bad."

Nope, I LOVED working out before all this crap started up. I'm not lazy, I'm fucked up somehow.  There are muscle conditions that cause exercise intolerance, so can thyroid disease. I first put it down to celiac disease, then B12 deficiency, then thyroid problems. Well, all that is accounted for and now I'm having even worse issues; I get too weak to sit up for long, for instance, and jumping muscles all day in a specific area (like my inner thigh, or my shoulder, or something in my side. Cognitively I'm a mess.  There are a lot of autoimmune diseases that come with these damned back spasms that end up going straight up to my head and giving me a migraine. I'm just now in the middle of getting a diagnosis, wish me luck.   Right now they're trying to eliminate/diagnose lupus, MS, myasthenia gravis, Isaac's syndrome (among other things). I'm pretty sure it's autoimmune since prednisone has a dramatic effect."

As much as I would have liked to exercise with him, I never exercise with my husband. I prefer to run and he is much faster than me, despite him never ever running, ever.

I was raised by a woman who was so cripplingly insecure that she felt the need to make a comment on physical appearance for literally every woman she sees. It's on tv, magazines, it's everywhere. It's part of our culture to evaluate a person and assign value (or take it away) based on appearance/ our assumptions of what their appearance signifies. If someone is skinny, she's anorexic. If someone had frizzy hair, she's a slob. It's a value system and it makes me want to scream."

Girls' toys are all themed around looking pretty, and boys' around being active.  Ditto clothes.  I saw these shoes in the store a while back with a picture of a boy on one side and a girl on the other--the boy was running in a field; the girl was sitting in a chair, looking pretty.    I can't really blame guys on Reddit for remarking on the attractiveness of the women they see when they--and women--have been taught that's how to regard females.

There is no point to my story other than that, I guess I honestly believe that skulls can be feminine.   I'm butch as heck. I have no idea what to do about it. I think she's going to blow my mind.

FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,foreverburning,12,Thu Jul 24 22:20:06 2014 UTC,"Oh my gosh, I can so sympathize with that. My mother was anorexic as a young adult, and obese after having 3 kids. She then became exercise-bulemic (obsessively counting calories and then exercising until she's burned exactly that many calories or more). My whole life she's been obsessed with weight and fitting specific standards of beauty. It kills me to see her doing that to herself. She never judged me or her other kids, but that attitude seeps in when you're used to hearing your own mother criticize everyone else's looks, and her own.   I still struggle with the knee-jerk habit of nit-picking others' appearance."

I mean, I feel BAD that she thinks that way but come on, woman. Build yourself up instead of tearing others down. It doesn't help that my dad is a shrink so between the two of them, they Re always diagnosing perfect strangers."
FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,SharkWoman,2,Mon Jul 21 16:37:47 2014 UTC,"Yup. I used to be friends with this guy who had a long-running (like, years-long) bet with a friend which involved him asking ""Is she hot?"" any time anyone mentioned a woman he didn't know in conversation. The answer wasn't important, and this was a guy who sought out classic feminist texts to read - stuff that I haven't even read - because he wanted to understand the origins of the movement, but it was still more acceptable for him to carry on with this totally sexist game, for the benefit of a friend several provinces away, than it was to lose the bet (oh my manhood!) and knock it off."
FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,citizenp,126,Tue Jul 22 01:47:46 2014 UTC,"Because a lot of those people see women as a decoration before a human. They look at a woman and the first thought that pops into there head is if they would fuck her or not, because through the wonderful world of oversexualization in all forms of media, women are still most often used as a display to sell something or an accessory for men's use or status. This is probably subconcious for most people but since sexism doesn't affect them directly and personally, they don't feel the need to change their views."
FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,HappyonaShelf,23,Mon Jul 21 13:10:01 2014 UTC,I don't think the answer could have been any more concise than your reply.
FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,wattypatat,6,Mon Jul 21 15:06:44 2014 UTC,There are a lot of women who are extremely conscious of their looks and everyone else's. They are even more likely to be the victim of sexism if they're attractive than if they aren't.

FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,Pertz,6,Tue Jul 22 08:19:22 2014 UTC,"There are (at least) two aspects to this, and I've been confused how to work with one of them. The first is easy, the commenting part. All I need to do to avoid being an obvious douche is to refrain from telling every woman I find attractive about that reaction. Or telling every comment thread about it. Easy peasy.   But your comment gets at the reaction itself. Assuming I've been conditioned as you describe - a fair assumption - what do I do about it? Because even though I'm in a happy committed relationship, in my head, I objectify the shit out of women, at work, at the park, at the gym, at the grocery store, etc. Do I try to suppress the ""oh wow, she's hot,"" ""I'd hit that,"" ""dammmmm,"" etc thoughts? Do I accept them and hope the next generation gets socialized differently? Are they even bad, assuming I don't verbalize them except when appropriate (e.g., to my SO or close friends)?   This bothers me because I consider myself a feminist, but have trouble reconciling that sometimes with that internal monologue."
FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,HeroOfTheSong,10,Tue Jul 22 03:36:17 2014 UTC,"Your unspoken thoughts are not strictly bad on their own. But I see what is bothering you.  Pair your unspoken thoughts with other questions. Put them into context.  You see an attractive woman. You think ""Damn, she's hot.""  Now add ""I wonder what kind of job she has?"". Think about what her life might be like. It does not need to be in-depth, just small details.  Contextualize, add more elements.  In your head, you build a person around the person you just perceive.  Her attractiveness becomes just one facet.  Just a suggestion."
FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,SharkWoman,3,Tue Jul 22 05:56:10 2014 UTC,"I agree with this.  Sometimes I see a muscular guy at the hardware store and thing ""oh gawd I love muscles, he's very handsome"".  But I""ve never thought those thoughts without simultaneously thinking of him as a person, too. Like ""he's tan, and looking at the stacks of wood, maybe he's a contractor, or building a deck for his wife.  I wonder if he's a nice guy, or if he's a dick?  Whoever he is, I hope he's happy with his life.""  You know, I often notice that in magazines when male holllywood stars are interviewed, they are photographed in such a way that their sexuality is 1. empowering, and 2. not their defining feature/the most valuable part of them.  IN other words, they are multifaceted people who happen to also be physically attractive, and their sexyness isn't ONLY about their looks.     I would love to see women treated that way! Because when female artists are interviewed and written about, they are photographed differently.  They're photographed as if their sexyness is only about their appearance, and that their appearance is the most important think about them.  ANd their sexuality isn't portrayed as empowering. That's objectification, and it's frustrating.  It isn't the whole 'using sex to sell' thing that bothers me,  its the objectification that I hate."
FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,kochipoik,7,Thu Jul 24 22:30:36 2014 UTC,"A few things:  Thoughts are not oppressive.  Actions (like voicing/typing thoughts) are.  Being sexually attracted to someone, and then communicating that to someone is not itself inherently sexist.  So the problem is when people are reduced to that.  When a woman is getting street-harassed about her breasts, at that juncture that's all it's about, her as an object.  The ""interaction"" is only about her physicality and how it can pleasure the harasser.  The comments don't happen in a vacuum, they are part of a larger pattern (as OP noticed), and this has an important power through pervasiveness.  Now that I think about it, street-harassment and the reddit posts we are talking about share many similarities.  I think the real question is, as a feminist, would you want your potential comment to be heard by your child (who you're wanting to socialized as a feminist)?  If not, that might be an indicator that it's an oppressive comment."

FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,so_srs,4,Tue Jul 22 03:48:53 2014 UTC,"I guess, as you say, the key is not verbalizing the things that pop into our heads that objectify people. I think everybody looks at strangers and considers if they are attracted to them or not, women do that too of course.  It's when it becomes acceptable to voice those thoughts, especially in a public forum, that it grows into an issue because eventually it's so widespread and normalized that it does become the first and only thing some people think of about an entire gender, usually women.   Calling out people who verbally objectify women constantly, and those who take it a step further and don't see women as anything but objects, is the key to making it unacceptable. It's not in any way an individual issue and it will take massive social conditioning and restraint in order to make big changes in the long run, but everyone has a part to play and can help even in a small way. I would never suggest you beat yourself up over it, as your self awareness puts you way ahead of the curve of the majority of people, but it's good to always be conscious and do your own small part in pointing out to offenders that this isn't okay."
FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,HappyonaShelf,1 point,Tue Jul 22 19:39:53 2014 UTC,"I would try and suppress the thoughts, or at least reply to yourself something along the lines of ""that's not nice/appropriate, ReaderHarlaw"" or just correct yourself into thinking something else, like ""hmm that jogger is running really fast"", ""I wonder why that woman is buying so many packets of easy-yo"".

It's a way to define the person in the picture by their terms instead of by that woman's terms. And it assumes that the world (and perhaps the woman herself) is just waiting for that pronouncement.  When a woman is shown in her professional capacity, as you describe, it's deliberately demeaning, stripping away her accomplishments and defining her as a object.  Women judged ""unattractive"" by the Authority of Reddit fare no better. In fact, they do worse, because, unlike the woman who is viewed as having the ""value"" of her attractiveness, they are deemed to have no value at all, regardless of the context of the picture.

My lesbian friends (every single one that I can think of) judge people by what they say and do. My girlfriends and younger guy friends are all pretty cool, we are all in the arts. But it is weird how some of them still feel the need to remark when I'm looking especially put-together.   I'm not sure it's ever proper to comment on the appearance of someone you don't know well. People from the suburbs seem to do this more than people in the city but maybe that's because the part of the city I'm in attracts more creative types who feel that beat up fingernails are a sign of having done some work and manicures are a sign that someone doesn't make anything."

It's part of masculinity and male culture and it starts very young.  I remember hanging out with my friends in elementary school, long before any of us had hit puberty or really found women attractive, and guys would say things like ""Dude, she's hot."" when a traditionally attractive woman passed us on the street.

FemmeThoughts,2bafo9,Shmaesh,-17,Tue Jul 22 04:24:29 2014 UTC,"Taking a slightly different tack here but I don't think it's a totally gendered issue.  It's interesting how a lot of times comments getting gonewild requests for a girl get heavily downvoted but ladybonersgw requests for a guy will get heavily upvoted.  Anyways it's not because women are objects any more than men are.  It's because humans love sex.    Regardless of gender or orientation (barring asexuality of course).  Humans are animals.  We want to fuck and we want to spread our genes.  It's buried into our very instincts and evolution has made it so that we get a lot of pleasure out of it.  None of this is bad.  I don't think there's anyone who can honestly say they haven't indulged in a bit of healthy objectification.  The issue is not about that, it's about why certain people feel compelled to comment on someone's attractiveness.  Reddit is majority male.  Go on Tumblr or the like and you'll see tons of comments from teenage girls flipping out about Doctor Who or Supernatural or the like.  The visibility of comments comes from reddit's voting system which does really weird things.  You get a majority of guys who can vote comments up pretty quickly, which pushes the comment higher up in visibility since most people only skim the top comments, who then push that comment up even higher.  And lastly this is armchair psychology but since a lot of things are marketed toward straight guys it can kind of be jarring when it's flipped around.  Naked chick in a movie?  Meh standard.  Naked man?  Dear god ew why.  (I've heard this from straight girls too. A depressing amount of people feel no guilt over calling penises ugly.)  So yeah it's obnoxious but I think internally we've all had those dirty thoughts.  It's just we're not morons so we keep our traps shut about them."

Wrede's YA novel series The Enchanted Forest Chronicles Kazul is King of the Dragons, a title she wins through tournament, essentially.  The idea of women Kings has been a favorite of mine since I read those books as a kid.  The rest of it references The Book of the City of Ladies by Christine de Pizan, which is sort of a semi-historical accounting of all the noteworthy women (real, semi-real  and apocryphal) that de Pizan had ever heard of.   I like to think of de Pizan's book as the first feminist manifesto.  So it's supposed to be tongue in cheek, but both references are very personal and fairly obscure."

Pizan's book does point out noteworthy women, yes. But the Treasure of the City of Ladies undoes a lot of that by advising women to be subservient to different degrees, depending on class.   I do love that Book is a response to the very-sexist Romance of the Rose."

She's the classic damsel in distress in a story where they could have let her rescue herself, but no, all she's got is threatening suicide:   Proud and unrelenting, Buttercup nonetheless had a passive role in the events of that comic romantic fantasy, and Wright Penn determined to play neither the princess nor the victim in future projects.

I'm a 54 year old woman who works in the music business, and I have to say, the younger men are so much cooler now than the young men I knew growing up. Women are almost as likely to be in or leading a rock band as men are. I was one of about 4 women I knew in my entire high school who played guitar.    I don't know if it's that more liberal minds are in creative pursuits or Reddit is just filled with lonely techie type guys who don't get out enough to be exposed to mixed gender situations, but Reddit does not represent real life from this vantage.   edit, duh, found it: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/18/men-entitled-women-friendzone"

That particular trope existed before he named it, and in naming it really kind of brought it to light for people who'd never thought about it.  I don't mind MPDG in all cases. I think if the story is written well she can sometimes serve to point out the male protagonist's shortcomings like in 500 Days of Summer. She was romanticized, she was never fleshed out, her wants and needs were never considered and in the end Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character learned himself a hard lesson about it.  I think in Garden State MPDG was done poorly. I don't think it was Natalie Portman's fault, I think her character was just so poorly written and the story kind of bumbled along and she was Zach Braff's kind of dream of how a quirky romance should go."

Like, I my last boyfriend's preference was for no hair, but I don't like shaving... so we agreed that if he'd pay for me to get waxed (which I much prefer) then I'd gladly do that for him, but otherwise he shouldn't expect me to shave my legs or bikini on the regular. Then I'd shave sometimes as a special treat for him, and he was always very appreciative, but never really expected me to do anything. I just did it to be nice sometimes, like how he sometimes styled his facial hair the way I liked. No one had to do anything, we just enjoyed making each other happy and stuff. But if he'd been a douche about it, expecting me to shave every d tayed in that relationship! Not just told him his opinion didn't matter, and counting it as a success when he shut up, christ. If you've come to that point, your relationship just needs to be over. That's like, possibly abusive relationship status.  Sorry, that really bothered me. There's a time and a place to be combative, but ideally-loving relationships you seek out and enter into willingly are not it. That shit's not healthy or strong or admirable."
FemmeThoughts,2ayhuk,downyballs,20,Fri Jul 18 03:28:40 2014 UTC,"While I think you have a good point, the way I think of it is that I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone who could see something so meaningless as so important.  If hairy legs is a dealbreaker, you're probably not a good fit for me in the first place, you know?  The point the article was driving at there is that she took a stand against letting other people control what she did with her body. It was definitely phrased...Bluntly. But the thrust of the point is super important in a society where women have our personal decisions largely dictated to us in order to be 'normal.'"
FemmeThoughts,2ayhuk,REAL_CONSENT_MATTERS,4,Thu Jul 17 17:44:53 2014 UTC,"Right, I agree! I agree, that's a fine dealbreaker, and if the article had said ""She talked of a boyfriend that didn’t find it attractive. 'I broke up with him, because he was clearly not the man for me.'"" I'd be cheering wildly. I just don't think that if you're trying to normalize something, portraying people who do it as really aggressive is the wrong way to do it... especially given the annoyingly pervasive narrative that feminists are all man-hating militant lesbians who want to emasculate men and reduce them to second class citizens. That's pretty much the opposite of what you want, if your goal is normalizing something into the larger society. No value judgement either way on militancy or aggression, but it's just at odds with making things seem nonthreatening."
FemmeThoughts,2ayhuk,iatemysocks,18,Thu Jul 17 17:48:30 2014 UTC,"Eh, I don't think much harm is done in a man being told his opinion on a woman's is irrelevant. IMO many women are way, way overly cautious about being pleasing sexual objects for men and treat men's opinions on their bodies as highly valuable and important.  Getting away from that is hugely important, and telling me ""your opinion on what I do with my body doesn't matter, what matters is what I want to do"" is a self-directed, clear, obviously reasonable statement. The fact that it strikes as man-hating says more about the ingrained nature of patriarchal thinking and less about the author's relationship, IMO."
FemmeThoughts,2ayhuk,REAL_CONSENT_MATTERS,-5,Thu Jul 17 18:02:31 2014 UTC,"A random man, no. But someone you're in a relationship with, yes. You should never, ever put down someone you're dating like that. There's a difference between saying ""my body is my own and I won't change my body to suit other people's desires, I hope that we can work through this incompatibility"" and ""I don't care about your opinion"". One is a positive statement about your own choices, and one is a shitty awful thing to say to someone you're dating, whatever their gender. If you can't treat the person you're with with respect, like... why are you dating them? On the extreme end of that scale, that's literally emotional abuse. In any case, it's certainly a sign of a messed up relationship. The fact that it can be justified as okay because in general, men need to stop thinking they're entitled to womens' bodies is exactly why people think feminists hate men.  There are issues about which I absolutely don't care about any man's feelings. I literally care zero about what any dude has ever thought about access to birth control, for example. But yeah I do think people should care about the people they are dating, and if you find you do not care about them, you should not be dating them. Treating them poorly when they're men isn't a big feminist win against the patriarchy. It's just a bad thing. Unless otherwise stated, your boyfriend probably isn't the enemy."
FemmeThoughts,2ayhuk,iatemysocks,16,Thu Jul 17 21:50:38 2014 UTC,"Am I the only one who assumed that that was probably paraphrasing...?   That said, some people can say stuff like that and be completely respectful and even affectionate. Tone and context matter more than words typed in an article on the internet."
FemmeThoughts,2ayhuk,iatemysocks,7,Thu Jul 17 22:08:44 2014 UTC,"I figured either paraphrasing or the tone really matters. The sentiment is probably ""your opinion doesn't matter on this issue"" in the sense that it isn't up to him. It could be read as ""your opinion doesn't matter"" about full stop, about anything, because I don't respect you, but that's probably not the intent.   And this is more blunt than it needs to be, but it could have been in response to an equally blunt complaint about the hair. It could have been in response to ""You need to shave, you're gross,"" in which case an even worse response would have been understandable."
FemmeThoughts,2ayhuk,REAL_CONSENT_MATTERS,2,Thu Jul 17 23:13:25 2014 UTC,"Definitely still a good point. I care less and less about whether or not I'm nonthreatening anymore, but the criticism is definitely valid and particularly this specific criticism."
FemmeThoughts,2ayhuk,iatemysocks,9,Thu Jul 17 23:44:55 2014 UTC,"I'm confused about why the two of you are debating a response you gained from secondhand information where that response was following a statement we haven't actually seen or heard heard. We have no reason to assume that ""doesn't matter"" wasn't an appropriate response to the boyfriend's statement."
FemmeThoughts,2ayhuk,jelliknight,1 point,Thu Jul 17 18:07:05 2014 UTC,"I mean, I just don't like that an article that's supposed to help a cause I like, has this big thing in it that I feel is actually probably going to make the problem worse. Like... no, no, shit, you were so close to being a useful resource I could recommend to people! That bugs me.  Edit: like, I want to be able to live in a world where my friggin natural legs aren't a threat to people, because I am sorry but this is what legs look like and legs should not be scary. But when you make women who don't shave sound scary and confrontational, that is the exact opposite of that goal. That's counterproductive. I don't like going backwards."

FemmeThoughts,2axrdk,onlykindagreen,11,Thu Jul 17 07:55:22 2014 UTC,"I will never stop linking to this essay.  ""Oppression,"" by Marilyn Frye.  It's the first essay my professor used to start a feminism class I took a few years ago.    Frye argues that the meaning of the term ""oppressed"" is stretched too far when we use it to refer to any piece of human suffering, like when men claim they're ""oppressed"" because they can't cry in public.  She thinks that we should, instead, reserve the use of the term ""oppression"" for groups that face systems of ""double binds.""  The double binds she gives as examples are pretty familiar - e.g. the pressure on women to wear revealing clothes and to not wear revealing clothes and the pressure on women to primarily focus on their career and to primarily focus on their family.  Frye thinks that these double binds restrict women's autonomy by working in concert.  They seem like little inconsequential inconveniences when you focus on them individually, but when their power is combined women are harmed.    Anyway, your post reminded me of some of the things Frye considers.  Whenever I'm frustrated with all the hypocrisy and meanness on reddit, I find myself looking through passages from the essay.  There are good critiques of the essay out there, but Frye is just short and sweet and on-point."

BUT, I'm so happy I've been reminded of this piece. I have seen it several times for several classes. And I really do think it's an interesting point.

How they ""pretend"" to be insecure for ""attention."" As if only certain people are insecure.  Redditors just can't empathize with women. Ever. Not even rape victims.

If I was three pounds lighter I would have been underweight. You could count every single rib on my body and the ones down the middle of my chest.  Girls get shit for their looks, women get shit for their looks. We get it constantly and from almost everyone.   Over 31 percent of women admit to forcing themselves to throw up or taking laxatives to lose weight, 75% have disordered eating, 20 million women in the US have anorexia.  I mean, shit... I had anorexia. I didn't look like I was dying on the inside but I definitely was. Both figuratively and literally.

The internet has this serious problem with people thinking they're the audience of everything or that someone is trying to speak for everyone. It's nuts. She shouldn't have to bend over backwards and clarify that when she uses ""I"" statements she does, in fact, intend to speak about her thoughts.   In addition to that, who is better qualified to understand feelings other than those who've experienced them? She shouldn't have to tip toe about it. I can have sympathy for people and maybe even some level of understanding and compassion but there just comes a point when people need to give up on trying to act like they've walked in everyone shoes. Life isn't some dumb contest about who has it worse, and no, sometimes we'll not understand things because we haven't lived them. And that should be okay. We shouldn't be more concerned about prefacing statements to cushion the emotions of people who might get offended at being told they understand something less than someone who has walked the walk. Besides, I don't think she meant shed have no empathy for anything ever, but that she wouldn't have had the ""fat perspective"" of life had she not been fat...Which actually makes a gargantuan amount of sense.   Anyway, that's my rant and only some of it relates to your post and some of it to others in this thread. Most of its just bring picky at the confusion of empathy/sympathy, and the fact that people are picking away at the author's lack of specificity. I know there are ""grey areas"" of empathy that she didn't cover such as degrees of empathy (being able to relate as much as you can without having experienced it, for example). I think most people want to empathize but unless people have been through it, it's much more likely we sympathize and perhaps have a dash of empathy."
FemmeThoughts,2avpgi,Pixelated_Penguin,19,Wed Jul 16 20:12:34 2014 UTC,"It's weird that she thinks that you can't gain a perspective without being fat.

And yes, there are a LOT of people who are blind to their own privilege, and don't have empathy for people who are ""other"". And she's open to the idea that she may have been one of them. What makes one person able to take the perspective of someone different, where another fails?

I fought with bastard sword, rapier and dagger, and pole arms, but my prof was also a fencing instructor. I think the reason there's a place for individual boobs is because it's supposed to be worn tight to the body so you don't limit mobility (important for the smaller weapons). I have also fought in full suits of armor with the bigger weapons, and no, those don't have individual boob holes. I guess it depends what Lady Thor's more concerned about."
FemmeThoughts,2as3ie,dedededede,4,Wed Jul 16 12:37:57 2014 UTC,"I guess the important difference is the ""sportive"" purpose and the flexible material. I would imagine that hardened leather might work, but I doubt metal would be safe in any way.  You can probably even test this with your own protection. When you hit yourself in the middle of the chest you should feel the pressure on your sternum. I think you should be able to feel a real difference in pressure to the protections without breast bulges."
FemmeThoughts,2as3ie,dedededede,6,Wed Jul 16 13:36:24 2014 UTC,"This may be a different breast plate than the one I actually wear, though they look the same. Mine's not flexible at all and I wouldn't say it ""absorbs"" hits. Look, would I wear a boob plate into actual battle? Absolutely not. Would I wear a full suit of armor? Absolutely not. Riot gear's a happy medium because you can still move a lot faster (have also fought in this). However, we're talking about a comic book character in a fantasy. My argument is that a boob plate and a chest plate are both impractical for different reasons and Lady Thor can wear whatever the hell she wants. Also, she's made up.

FemmeThoughts,2as3ie,Shaysdays,9,Wed Jul 16 14:32:54 2014 UTC,"I think normal fencing is a completely different use case for breast protection. The protection is probably not made of metal and not suited for full contact battle situations...  AFAIK boob shaped plates for real combat are very dangerous. When somebody attacks you with a hammer or you fall down it should crush your sternum or something like that, because the pressure is concentrated on the tiny part between the boobs. When a sword hits you in the middle of your chest it is not deflected sideways but maybe even slides upwards between your boobs directly in your throat.

FemmeThoughts,2as3ie,mrscienceguy1,6,Wed Jul 16 08:11:29 2014 UTC,"That is actually the issue with the horns Wagner put on Viking helmets, as well. Real Viking helmets were conical. My prof was also a fencing instructor, though we used heavier weapons. I have also fought in full suits of armor - those do not have ""boob"" plates, but they're slower. The reason fencing breast plates have individual boob holes is so it can be worn tighter to the body and won't limit mobility. Even if I wore a men's breast plate from the suit of armor and that's it, I'd be way slower than if I wore a form fitting one - it'd get in the way of my arcs and swings (thrusts would be fine). So. If she's supposed to be in full on, 100 years war battle gear, she should just wear a full suit. If she's going for speed, agility, and only wants an extra layer, boob plate is fine, IMO."
FemmeThoughts,2as3ie,dedededede,1 point,Wed Jul 16 12:43:02 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but such light protection should be made of a flexible material that breaks/bends before puncturing the sternum. I think form fitting metal plates for women would work like a gouge. You would probably just have to stumble and fall onto it and that was it..."

If you're going to complain about practicality when an advanced alien species wears it, why does no one complain about the practicality with regards to metal plate being useless against bullets.  Complaints about it being sexualisation are completely fair, but people need to stop thinking they're smart for pointing out it's not useful in sword fighting, which isn't really relevant."

And even the fact that trans people exist is almost never acknowledged in stories that contain gender bending.    Unless there's some serious messing around with the very being of a person to change their gender identity, most characters who find themselves in a body of another sex will start feeling the effects of gender dysphoria, and seek to turn back one way or another.    If Thor Odinson the individual woke up in a womans body he would most likely (unless he is trans) still indentify as a man, and if he could not find some magical way to turn back, he would probably go on the asgardian version of FtM HRT.    Basically it's too easy to fuck up gender bending."
FemmeThoughts,2asuvx,prefinished,2,Fri Jul 25 19:48:34 2014 UTC,"The Second Law of Gender Bending is bullshit because 99% of people are cis, and afaik Thor as we know him is too.   well, sure, but it's not that simple. This is a fantasy world, you could easily make one where gender is fluid and doesn't really matter the same way. Sure, it's rarely done properly, but in fantasy, if you make the society as fantastical as the magic powers, the 2nd law of gender bending has real possibilities.  I mean, I agree that this stuff usually isn't done well, and I'd be wary of a gender bend too. But I'm not against it in general. I'd like to see more gender bends actually, just, yanno, well done.   The real problem is that scifi and fantasy often fall short in imagining society differently. Sure, cool powers and different cultures, but they've often all got this one ingrained underneath and that's just such BS."

Criticizing something for doing a crappy job pandering when your demographic is already the majority is just not cool.

My favorite line:   But the moment we re-imagine the world as a buzzing hive of individuals with a variety of genders and complicated sexes and unique, passionate narratives that have yet to be told – it makes them harder to ignore. They are no longer, “women and cattle and slaves” but active players in their own stories.

Because this is the way we talk, when we talk about history and use the word “soldiers” it immediately erases any women doing the fighting. Which is it comes as no surprise that the folks excavating Viking graves didn’t bother to check whether the graves they dug up were male or female. They were graves swords in them. Swords are for soldiers. Soldiers are men.  It was years before they thought to even check the actual bones of the skeletons, instead of just saying, “Sword means dude!” and realized their mistake.  Women fought too."

IT would be very hypocritical of your husband to judge you on your wrinkles, since he will probably get them too.

I've been with people who had serious physical flaws, and been told by other people about my flaws. If you have chemistry with someone, wrinkles don't matter.

I fear what I will look like at 59, the age of the woman in this piece. I guess I'm glad that I look younger than my age, but it's only a matter of time before time catches up to me.  While the guy who told this woman that she was ""too wrinkly"" must be somewhere on the sociopathic spectrum not to understand how badly he was hurting her, I suspect that he speaks for more men than have the tumerity to  actually say this out loud.   Unfortunately, a man is only going to be able to get sexual enjoyment when he has been aroused and most guys are aroused through visual stimulation. Where does that leave real women who don't fit the image of sexual perfection?  And what are we to think of these men? Is it their fault if we don't turn them on? Is there even a way for them to reset their arousal switch when they've been aroused by young women for their entire lives?"

I also know plenty of women that are aroused visually, and my male partner prefers tactile sensations to visual ones.  It said a lot about cultural expectations that when the first time we had sex and he turned the lights out, it made me insecure rather than thinking ""Oh! He's a touch guy!"""

Just because men are socialized to believe they deserve perfect female bodies to fuck doesn't mean that's a normal or healthy expectation. Again, if you find yourself completely unattracted to your sexual partner you should not be in a sexual relationship. I'm not going to alter my body to be as least offensive as possible so that a poor man wont have to inconvenience himself at the sight of me. Fuck that. That's dehumanizing and sexist."

I have more fear of a day when I'd care about that again.   And I'm no Wonder Woman and I don't have limitless self esteem. In fact I'm desperately fighting my lack of self esteem long enough to make some friends in this town, it just that age and lack of feminine beauty aren't my insecurities.   It's also fine if you have those insecurities, just don't speak for others. I used to be really afraid of not being the perfect photoshop barbie model. Every now and then something in media will make me feel inadequate but those times are fewer and farther in between. I usually feel the inclination to write about toxic femininity as I've done here. Insecurities aren't wrong, they're a part of you, but they come from things society tells you and not from some inherent self. When they rule us we suffer.   I still stand by what I said earlier. If my partner decides I'm no longer attractive in my old age and grows in disinterest then we are no longer sexually compatible. That's no fault of my own but potentially his/her inability to find attraction outside of the toxic societal gender norms for female bodies. I believe sexual therapy/counseling  may help people with that condition but I haven't looked too much into it."
FemmeThoughts,2ap2mb,dragonscampfire,8,Tue Jul 15 02:51:20 2014 UTC,"aging is not dehumanizing - the reason it feels dehumanizing to you is that you are putting too much value on your external appearance - you are buying into things like aspirational media and advertising, and it has made some people think of themselves as a commodity on a market instead of a human being"

I don't get how he can't see his own body as repulsive and want to hide it if he has that much of an issue with wrinkles.  The question can be turned around that women are use to being attracted to young men when they are young and has they age, should they accept older men when they've been attracted to younger ones?  What I thought was worse, as you mentioned, he thought it was acceptable to tell a woman to hide her body for his pleasure and ignoring her own."

There's nothing particularly unique about mass sexualization other than the fact it arose when men were in positions of power.

I bet if you spend time with people who have their priorities in order, it will be easier for you to clearly see what you want for your own life.  Here's another important thing I've learned: some people can appear shallow and trendy on the surface but are actually very experienced in life and thoughtful. Don't let appearances fool you and don't fall into the trap of thinking that their appearance is a threat to your own journey of disengaging from trends. They are not a threat, they are human.  Good luck on your journey.   Oh, and also I want to point out that the very definition of a trend is something whose relevance is fleeting, so obviously if you want to be ""relevant,"" trendy is the last thing you should shoot for."
FemmeThoughts,2aqxcf,sugarhoneybadger,3,Tue Jul 15 13:20:13 2014 UTC,"I always feel pressure to conform to rapidly evolving fashion and beauty trends.   I'd say you answered your own question. Fashion and beauty trends are meant to be fun and exciting. I suppose pressure could encourage someone to engage in these activities, but it's supposed to be a fun way of expressing yourself, not a stressful task necessary for fitting in.   I feel like if I don't follow all the trends I will simply be old and irrelevant    I'm sorry you feel that way. This is the kind of thinking which leads to feeling old. Not everyone in a certain age bracket cares, or cares deeply, about fashion or beauty. It's not indicative of any age, nor is not caring. I think you're psyching yourself out about this without identifying the root cause: it sounds like you are afraid you will feel old. That's different from everyone around you thinking that you are, although it's much more difficult for women to accept this because the media attempts to tell us otherwise. Real people aren't as soulless as media corporations who make money by making women feel badly about themselves. Clothing never decides your age, that's all reliant on your attitude about yourself.   What's the difference between giving no fucks, and just being closed minded and stuck in the past?   The way you feel when you form decisions is the difference. If you consider something openly and decide you dislike it, that is different from feeling your identity is being questioned by new trends and you must therefore hide yourself away. It's a difference in attitude.   anal sex   What is this about anal sex that I keep seeing on this subreddit? Anal sex is not something people do very often, or at all, in real life.    and not complain about not receiving an orgasm   If anything, the fact that women can orgasm is being more and more illuminated. If someone doesn't care that you orgasmed, that person is not following trends, they are simply selfish. Selfish people, like all unpleasant people, will attempt to justify their behavior by saying everyone else is just like them. This is a lie. Never listen to anything like that. Most people care about their partner, male or female, and the ones who don't do not deserve to have one.   Once you get older, sex will be less fun   I can't personally attest, but I've heard the opposite. People gain more experience as they age! If you're really worried, just work on becoming/staying flexible.  You don't need to follow trends. Sure, each season, trendy things are bought and sold. But a bunch of timeless pieces are sold, too. If anything, more timeless pieces are being sold.  My advice is to try figuring out why you are feeling insecure enough to get caught in these carefully laid malicious traps. Work on loving and celebrating yourself. And as previously suggested, try to find people who do not harbor these toxic ideas for friends.  edit When I say ""or not at all"", I am not positing that no one engages in anal sex, I mean that if you take one person at random it is more likely than not that they have never tried anal sex before."

Anal sex is not something people do very often, or at all, in real life.   It's certainly not uncommon, but it's not as common as OP has been lead to believe. The idea that people hardly ever do it is a little inaccurate."
FemmeThoughts,2aqxcf,nacida_libre,3,Tue Jul 15 16:44:38 2014 UTC,"I admit I was relying on anecdotal evidence, so I did some research. According to The Center for Disease Control and Prevention, through 2006-2008, 44% of men and 36% of women admit to having had anal sex at least once. The ages ranged from 18-44. According to the New York Magazine, the Center for a Disease Control's National Survey of Family Growth found in 2013 that 38.2% of men between 20-39 and 31.6% of women between 18-44 engaged in heterosexual anal sex.   However, the actual report states that this is not a statistic for regular anal sex, it is only a statistic representing those who have ever tried anal sex. Furthermore, because the ages range from 18-44, a large chunk of people who answered that they had tried anal sex in the previous studies will also answer that they had tried anal sex in this new study, as well as some folks who have never tried it before. I can't believe everyone who tried it once continued to integrate it as a regular part of sex, and that conclusion is, despite sensational article writers' wishes, not supported by the research."
FemmeThoughts,2aqxcf,faierie,1 point,Tue Jul 15 17:55:30 2014 UTC,I would say it still happens more often than hardly ever at all.
FemmeThoughts,2aqxcf,nacida_libre,4,Tue Jul 15 18:04:04 2014 UTC,"You are certainly entitled to do so. All we have to go on from these studies is that about 4/10 men and about 3/10 women have tried it at least once in their lives. I think that means the number of people who engage in anal sex regularly must be lower than those figures, and disproportionally more common with certain types of people and communities (such as the BDSM community), but make of it what you will."
FemmeThoughts,2aqxcf,faierie,1 point,Tue Jul 15 18:26:56 2014 UTC,"Obviously there's going to be less people doing it regularly than have tried it. It isn't such an accepted sex act that people really talk about it openly. For the most part, people kind of suck at having anal sex, through no fault of their own. Porn makes it look too easy.  Maybe I've just been spending too much time on /r/sex, but anal sex doesn't seem to be extremely rare anymore."
FemmeThoughts,2aqxcf,nacida_libre,4,Tue Jul 15 19:07:52 2014 UTC,"Like I'm supposed to look and fuck like a porn star and I better get used to anal sex even if I dont like it, and not complain about not receiving an orgasm myself - and cool girls let their boyfriends fuck other women.    Okay, first of all, most people don't have anal sex regularly. It's common, but not that common. Most people don't look like porn stars. Why would you be with someone who didn't care about your orgasm? Open relationships are still pretty taboo. I don't know where you live, but when I look around, that definitely doesn't describe what I see around me. I see a lot non-fashionable, non-porn star looking and happy people going about their lives.  I think you do have an unhealthy thought process. Why do you care about being ""relevant?"" Do you really think there aren't a ton of ""irrelevant"" people out there? I think you need to start exposing yourself to different environments, because clearly where you're spending your time is skewing your perception."
FemmeThoughts,2aqxcf,nacida_libre,2,Tue Jul 15 11:34:58 2014 UTC,"I feel really sorry for you.  I'm totally the opposite.  I do my own thing, and if someone doesn't like it, that's their problem.  I don't think anybody really cares.  I've always been that way.  I'm not too weird, I don't think.  I'm just me.  And that's perfect.  My body is my domain, and the things I do with my boyfriend are things that we both get off on.  We've had conversations about what we are comfortable with.  Sex is amazingly good for both of us.  He would never want me to do something I don't want to do, and vice versa.  We each want to please the other, and that works out great.  Why on earth are you buying into the hype?  Find what works for you and go with it.  Don't be a fashion victim.  That's just pathetic.  Be you.  Be confident with who you are.  Be authentic."
FemmeThoughts,2aqxcf,FreyjaSunshine,2,Wed Jul 16 02:09:35 2014 UTC,"I don't judge people who feel pressured to follow fashion. It does mean something in certain contexts. There are jobs where you need to look like you're on top of things and that includes fashion, cars, jewelry, location, etc.   I'm in the music business, I'm lucky that I can just hang out with artists (musicians, fine artists, photographers, writers). There are very few of us who are even conscious of fashion; I feel lucky that my band shirt and 4 year old jeans are just fine.   Maybe you come from a middle-class suburban situation where people are judged harshly for not following trends. Perhaps it's less stressful for you to keep up with these, things, I'm not sure how that works or why you feel the pressure. I trust that there's real pressure for you, though, and you have to figure out whether it's important to who you want to be.   And screw these people in here who are dissing you for bringing up an honest topic. We all have to live and function in the real world despite the highest of ideals. Not everyone is capable of taking on the stress of reworking their entire lifestyle; I wouldn't do it based on some jerk's snap judgement of what is best for you."
FemmeThoughts,2ak3c3,darkbrownvoice,18,Sun Jul 13 02:55:32 2014 UTC,It's just way too tempting to focus on one area of the body. And it's never (rarely?) an area we are happy with. I like my thighs right now but don't care for my abs. Last year I kinda hated my thighs. In 2010 it was my teeth. Why the hell do I objectify myself in this way? Did I internalize something from society?  Anyway I know that feels. hugs

Step 1:  Stare at your face in the mirror.  Try to do sexy faces and poses.  End up looking stupid instead.  Take a selfie and get annoyed because you're used to your appearance in the mirror which is backwards.  Complain about your lack of photo-genicness.  But you're still cute.  It's the camera that needs to change.  Step 2:  Practice your runway walk in front of the mirror.  Try to ignore the fact that you are wobbling in your heels and could snap an ankle at any moment.  The newborn giraffe look is very in this season.  Step 3:  Put some banging music on.  Dance sexy in the mirror.  Realize it looks more like you are an octopus that got thrown on land and is now flailing trying to get back in the water.  Keep dancing.  Acknowledge your fierceness.  Step 4:  You're walking around town.  Gaze at yourself in all the glass windows you find.  Admire your beauty and do the point wink and click thing with your finger.  Realize that the car has tinted windows and there is a person inside.  Pretend this never happened."
FemmeThoughts,2ak3c3,maerad,9,Sun Jul 13 05:05:34 2014 UTC,"Okay I always tell people I wish I knew how to tell then to be more self-confident, but don't know how; you just nailed how to do it, along with, like, all the things I do when I wanna feel good about myself. Also add putting on an outfit that you feel amazing in, and flirting shamelessly with your reflection."

FemmeThoughts,2ak3c3,meldolphin,2,Sun Jul 13 06:40:06 2014 UTC,Hi I'm pretty happy with my body. So now you've met someone.
FemmeThoughts,2ak3c3,mundabit,3,Sun Jul 13 08:59:16 2014 UTC,That's awesome! Definitely gives me hope to know that people out there can ignore all those messages telling us to hate ourselves.
FemmeThoughts,2ak3c3,Damemontague,4,Sun Jul 13 09:05:37 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty happy with my body too.  Which for me involved ditching all scales (completely), having a really supportive partner (though when he told me I was 'ripening' when I gained twenty pounds was kind of awkward) and using my body for things I enjoy.  I am not model shaped and the older I get, the frumpier my body shape seems to look. But I'm happy with what I've got. It mostly works and it's mostly healthy and model shape or no, it's possible to get there, I promise.   We need to learn to love our bodies because they're ours. They're us and for fuck's sake, they're good enough."

FemmeThoughts,2ak3c3,meldolphin,1 point,Thu Jul 17 01:24:34 2014 UTC,Yeah I have a bit of that going too.  It's easy enough for me to be confident I think.
FemmeThoughts,2ak3c3,arbitraryarchivist,15,Sun Jul 13 13:37:22 2014 UTC,"""proportional"" is a cop out compliment. It's a way for people to say either ""not ugly"" or ""fucking hot"" without being too objective or out of line. It's meant to be a positive statement regardless of intent, but sadly it has turned into the ""I prefer girls without make up"" version of boob-related comments.  To me, Proportional breasts are not about how they relate to the rest of you, it's how you hold them, You can be morbidly obese with mosquito bites, or dangerously anorexic with a set of basketballs, But they could still be ""proportional"" if I see you holding yourself confidently and proudly.   I see ""proportional"" as a synonym for ""they suit you"", and generally its about your attitude to them, Do you love your boobs? if you do, that's probably why your breasts look so beautiful. If you hate your boobs, that's probably why you slouch or hold yourself awkwardly and accidentally accentuate the flaws you think you see.  I have tiny breasts compared to the rest of me, Sure they may be 34F cups, but my hips are 55"" so my boobs are shadowed by that. But I still get compliments on my bust, even with people looking at the whole of my body. You know why? because breasts are awesome no matter what (unless they are trying to kill you, then you need to show them who is boss) and I only associate myself with people who feel the same.  Booty is also awesome, I would kill for a big bum. I used to have really nice hips and a big booty, but I've been focusing on toning up and I'm in that awkward stage of having lost all of the shapley padding (fat) on my lower half but I haven't yet developed any curvy muscle. Meanwhile my gut is still a big baby-belly (despite not being pregnant) and I feel like my lack of booty makes that worse. But It's strange, the exact features I hate about myself I find to be incredibly attractive in other women, I'm a huge fan of the pear shape, But my opinion doesn;t count for anything on this matter. Everyone is going to like something different and as cliché as it is, the only opinion that matters is your own. I may not like how my body looks, But my body is amazing, it can run and jump and bend and stretch, It takes fuel like boring old apples and lettuce and converts that into beautiful acts of dance, thought and song."
FemmeThoughts,2ak3c3,arbitraryarchivist,2,Sun Jul 13 11:22:43 2014 UTC,"This is a really lovely and thoughtful reply, thank you. Taking more pride in my body is definitely something I need to work on, it's so easy to feel ashamed instead."
FemmeThoughts,2ak3c3,faierie,14,Mon Jul 14 06:01:21 2014 UTC,"Ick.  ""Proportional"" is the go-to nice word when trying to comfort someone with body image issues.  It's like saying, ""Don't worry, you're not out-of-bounds.  Yet.""  Fuck proportion.  Your body shape is codified in every cell of your body, written in a bonded chemical stairway, unique to you.    Edit: wording"
FemmeThoughts,2ak3c3,sugarhoneybadger,3,Sun Jul 13 07:11:56 2014 UTC,"I feel awkward now because I actually told my girlfriend that when she expressed concern that her breasts were too small.

FemmeThoughts,2air2b,julialex,3,Sun Jul 13 04:43:17 2014 UTC,"Congratulations! :) as someone who didn't receive any male attention whatsoever until I was around your age I really do understand how great it can feel. I also didn't have my first relationship until I was 19, and I was essentially invisible to men until that point. There's nothing wrong with that, and there's a myriad of reasons why that can happen but having gone through it I understand it can still be a blow to the ego. We're only human after all!   It was pretty exciting when guys started flirting with me for the first time as well, and at first I did the same thing as you and denied it - ""Oh he's probably just a player."" ""Maybe I'm just imagining it!"" - but don't do that! As long as it's positive, non-threatening attention there's nothing wrong with enjoying a little harmless flirtation! :)"
FemmeThoughts,2air2b,julialex,3,Sun Jul 13 05:35:11 2014 UTC,"Yes! I'm just starting to learn that... Hopefully I'll get better at it, too! I'm not exactly gifted in making flirty conversation... But I'll learn! Haha."
FemmeThoughts,2air2b,Train_Under_Water,3,Sat Jul 12 19:59:46 2014 UTC,"Of course it's also possible that he's a player, or that he was practicing or whatever, but I'm trying to focus on the positive here.   I'm not sure the other extreme, that he was approaching you unknown with an eye to marriage, is so great. :) So don't worry if guys who flirt with you are just guys who feel comfortable flirting. It doesn't mean you are any less cute.  If you are from a culture where girls tend to have long hair (regardless of his culture), you probably seemed really intriguing.     At a certain point I discovered if I smiled in the direction of a guy I thought was cute, he would usually come and talk to me if we were in a casual environment. It doesn't mean he would be perfect, or we would get married, just that a guy would be terrified to approach a woman who didn't seem approachable. Which is just as well, since the type of guy who would approach an unavailable-looking woman is going to seem rape-y."
FemmeThoughts,2air2b,Buffalo__Buffalo,3,Sun Jul 13 05:38:07 2014 UTC,"That's true... I never thought of it that way! Well I love my hair, so I'm not going to change anyway. Haha."
FemmeThoughts,2air2b,Buffalo__Buffalo,2,Sat Jul 12 22:52:36 2014 UTC,Yes you'd probably be surprised what attention you get if you look friendly. Just be careful and make sure you feel safe. I hope you continue to meet people you find interesting.

FemmeThoughts,2ahv97,descartesb4thehorse,15,Sat Jul 12 07:40:45 2014 UTC,"Yup, my first thought was that is not nearly degrading enough, oops, I mean not nearly showing enough skin to be compared. With the girl, there really is not much left to the imagination. Therefore we should see some serious bulge, right?"
FemmeThoughts,2ahv97,ninasayers21,14,Sat Jul 12 09:40:32 2014 UTC,"I don't even have a problem with the sexiness aspect of it or the fact that there's a lot of skin showing.  Our society needs to be less puritanical with sex - sex and sexyness can be good.    The problem is that it just seems like when ads use sex to sell things, they do it in such a way that seems to purposely degrade women, but when they use MEN to sell sex, it doesn't seem to be done in such a way that degrades him.  Like in Ads where the man is sexy, he looks powerful and confident and like he owns his own sexuality REGARDLESS of how much of his skin is showing - it's obvious that his sexuality and appearance is a healthy part of him but not his defining  feature or most important attribute. In ads when women look sexy, it just looks like they purposely made it look degrading for her even when she is fully clothed.  It isn't even about how much skin shes' showing because ads for men's undies show a lot of skin and bulge.    The whole thing weirds me out because it implies that people like seeing women degraded which is fucking creepy unless of course you are in a healthy, consensual, BDSM relationship in which your fetish is to be degraded.    In other words, it seems like when men are used to sell a product though sex, he isn't as objectified as much, but women are objected way more when they are used to sell sex and it isn't fair  Why is that?  am I crazy? does that made sense? or am I being a prude?"
FemmeThoughts,2ahv97,faierie,3,Sat Jul 12 11:05:53 2014 UTC,I wish advertisers would just talk about their products and cease the overt attempts at conditioning.
FemmeThoughts,2ahv97,faierie,3,Tue Jul 15 18:49:40 2014 UTC,"In my opinion this project would have been more compelling (I still find it very compelling) if the conventional attractiveness of the actors were identical. I think the ""geeky"" girl was much, much more conventionally attractive than the ""geeky"" guy, and the men copying the women weren't nearly as conventionally attractive. Though I understand why that could have been problematic."
FemmeThoughts,2ahv97,HumanMilkshake,7,Tue Jul 15 18:44:31 2014 UTC,There's a severe lack of mankini in those ads

Positive motivation, you know?"

FemmeThoughts,2aegxu,silent-farts,10,Tue Jul 15 03:52:33 2014 UTC,"To be honest, I think this is mostly due to vanity sizing - as ""smaller"" sizes increase, you obviously need new labels to accommodate folks who cannot find clothes to fit them."
FemmeThoughts,2aegxu,HappyonaShelf,6,Fri Jul 11 10:58:06 2014 UTC,"As far as I know they're not shifting regular sizes down and reclassifying them, they're actually adding a new size category. Maybe adult women don't want to have to buy little girl clothes and maybe petites are too short."
FemmeThoughts,2aegxu,silent-farts,8,Fri Jul 11 15:06:07 2014 UTC,"From my own personal observations, I'd say they are, that it's (largely) due to vanity sizing. If I recall correctly, a 000 corresponds to a 23-24"" waist which isn't that small and could certainly accommodate most healthy teenagers and quite a few adults without even touching on the petite market.  Certainly it's a good thing that adults'll have more clothing options, I hope the 000 really takes off."
FemmeThoughts,2aegxu,HappyonaShelf,4,Fri Jul 11 15:10:08 2014 UTC,"Petite is a proportional thing, not a size thing. Shorter statured women need a shorter waist and arms, for instance, in proportion to their width.   If I recall, petite sizes go up to 12.   I'm 5'5"" but it's all in my legs. There are times when I look better in a petite dress than the same dress in women's size, because the length of my waist doesn't really match my legs."
FemmeThoughts,2aegxu,HappyonaShelf,4,Mon Jul 14 20:52:06 2014 UTC,"Okay, I'm sorry.  By petite, I meant thin and small.

I mean, ""size 000"" sounds really stupid and is vanity sizing just because you can't be -3 sizes, I completely agree with that. I just checked J-Crews's size 000 and it's the smallest waist I've ever seen being offered for adults in an American store. If the news anchors were only critiquing the size system I really wish they would have specifically said so, and talked about the entire under size 1 system, size 0 and 00 included. I do feel better, though. I hope this was a reason for their report even if they executed it like morons. Good on you for seeing through the stupid, haha.

Or something along those lines but you get my drift while being somewhat flippant.  Sorry, clothes sizing annoys me.  Eventually we'll end up with today's 000 being equivalent to something like 000000 - where's the pride in saying you're an 8 when there's such ridiculous vanity sizing?

While consulting the J-Crew size chart I noticed Japan starts their system at ""1"". I don't understand why they seem to be the only country doing that, but even then, why can't companies just list their measurements? They always need to add a size chart, it would be so much more simple and healthy to just go by inches. You know, like MEN's clothing. >:( face indeed!  If I open an online clothing store, I'm labeling the different sizes by various mythical creatures. Size 8 can be a unicorn and size 12 can be a mermaid! Ain't no one holding back bragging about being one of those or a fairy or water nymph. Or yeah, I could just use inches.   Venting feels so good. Thanks!"

Nope. Clothes are doomed.  I have no clue how women's sizing works, inches would make sense as would centimetres (though I don't think a lot of people would like to buy a band size 90 bra unless they're already used to it, that was just off the top of my head...).  I don't even know why clothes sizes are in even numbers only here - it's pretty recent too, my mum was an 11 back in the day.  [>:( face intensifies]  If those numbers correlate to UK sizes as they currently are, can you make the 8 a dragon? I wanna say I'm a dragon!

Another interesting note about how constrictive gender roles can be damaging to everyone and not just women: more men than women suffer from mood disorders. Some theorize that because men are pressured throughout their life to hide their emotions, some end up bottling their emotions. Without a healthy outlet, this can develop into a mood disorder."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,pillow_kitty,13,Fri Jul 11 00:02:24 2014 UTC,"Huh, I've actually heard the opposite in many cases.  Women appear to be mentally ill more often because they are more likely to seek help and get diagnosed."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,meldolphin,6,Fri Jul 11 00:16:19 2014 UTC,"You might be right! I heard that fact a long time ago, and perhaps I'm getting it mixed up with the fact that more men commit suicide."

FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,meldolphin,9,Fri Jul 11 00:25:44 2014 UTC,"You're right about the first point. From the World Health Organization:   Gender bias occurs in the treatment of psychological disorders. Doctors are more likely to diagnose depression in women compared with men, even when they have similar scores on standardized measures of depression or present with identical symptoms.   EDIT: I'm linking the WHO article because reading through it was really validating actually having a large organization confirm facts about gender bias in mental health with studies.   http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/242.pdf?ua=1"

Sounds like he's gotten to you so much that you're apologetic even in your post in here. Who decides that your reaction is ""overly"" emotional, and not just an emotional reaction? I suspect your emotional reaction is representative of the situation you are faced with and exacerbated by the frustration you feel about his refusal to understand or empathise. But none of that would be considered ""overly""."

I think if I had a friend who was getting a bit obsessive about her exes, and not just one but over and over again through every relationship, I'd be pretty worried about her.  Anecdote time:  I was once a crazy psycho ex-girlfriend.  Really, I deserved that title in every way.  Clingy, couldn't let it go, threatening suicide, all that jazz.  I don't know what you could call that behavior really.  Shitty, that's for sure.  Granted I was going through mental illness (I've got bipolar disorder although at the time I was misdiagnosed and my meds were not sitting well with me) but what do you even call someone who's doing that?  Hurting?  In pain?  In desperate need of help?  Pretty good descriptions but just going through a hard time doesn't entitle anyone to hurt others like that.  I guess I'm saying I don't know what you call someone who is a whirlwind of hate hellbent on lashing out at everyone else.  Mental illness doesn't excuse shitty behavior.  Calling someone with a mental illness ""crazy"" is way out of bounds but when that person is ruining people's lives I don't know what they are."

FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,notenoughtokillme,7,Thu Jul 10 21:29:07 2014 UTC,"I actually have some issues with this saying because it's also common for people who've been abused in the past to be targeted by multiple people for abuse (i.e. if you were abused as a child you're more likely to end up in an abusive relationship, if you've been in an abusive relationship you're more likely to be in another one, if you've been raped once you're more likely to get raped again, etc.)  I mean, if a guy told me all of his exces were ""crazy,"" I'd definitely be giving him the side eye because of how often that word is used to discredit women. But that doesn't mean that if someone has had bad experiences with a lot of people then they're automatically the one at fault."

You can say ""they're struggling heavily with mental illness"" or ""their thoughts and actions are irrational and out of control"" or ""someone who needs to get their shit together before they can engage in healthy relationships"", but you don't just dismiss it as crazy and move on.   Partly, it's the same reason you don't call someone with multiple sclerosis a cripple - it's a derisive word that doesn't really raise any empathy for that person's disability, but just bringing attention to it in a negative way. It's sad that legitimate terms have turned into pejorative ones, but they have, and it's just not really helpful to keep bringing up terms that have a history of slur usage and hurtfulness.   But it's also partially because ""crazy"" (and other similar slurs) basically boil a complex issue down into one word... and a watered-down word, at that. What does ""crazy"" mean? It's not very specific - it's been used to describe women who are mildly perturbed at their boundaries being pushed, in the same way it's used to describe some legitimately mentally-unhealthy behavior like suicide threats or abuse. Heck, it's even used colloquially just to talk about anything that is out of the ordinary or exceptional (in a good or bad way): ""man, that was a crazy party last night""; ""That professor is totally crazy for giving us such a short deadline for this term paper"".   So I don't think it really is the best term to use. I think you actually should say, in your scenario, something like ""that person has shitty behavior linked to their mental illness"" or even, as you said, ""ruining people's lives"". Yes, sometimes people struggling with mental illness really need a reality check and some tough love to get them the help they need. But I just don't really think they need to be called ""crazy"", and I really don't think it helps any of the stigma to just throw that label around to everyone, rather than evaluating their specific circumstances and needs."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,meldolphin,9,Thu Jul 10 23:37:57 2014 UTC,"Maybe you misunderstood me, I said that we should not call people crazy.  I'm just saying I don't really know the best term to differentiate people with mental illness who aren't hurting people from those who are.  I remember when it was speculated that Chris Brown had bipolar disorder and all I could think was ""well fuck here we go again.""  People hear about mental illness and say ""well they are just hurting and they can't help themselves.""  No, fuck that, I do not want to be lumped in with assholes who cower behind their diagnosis as an excuse to be shitheads.  It just adds to the stigma unnecessarily."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,keakealani,8,Thu Jul 10 23:42:03 2014 UTC,"I see - you're right, I think I did misunderstand. Sorry about that! :)  But, well, I still think in general it's important to be specific and differentiate when we're talking about someone who's successfully dealing with mental illness and who isn't. I don't even completely subscribe to the idea that there are ""assholes who cower behind their diagnosis as an excuse to be shitheads"" - I think they're just in a different part of their wellness/treatment scheme.   That isn't to say that some people are absolutely hurtful and out of control and really need help, and that it can be helpful when dealing directly with someone to understand if they are in the throes of uncontrolled mental illness that is causing them to be horrible people, as opposed to someone who is mentally ill but under control or actively seeking treatment.   And I completely agree that a huge part of the stigma is the sense that everyone with mental illness is some sort of out of control freak of nature who isn't able to handle themselves at all, and it's totally unhelpful to lump everyone together regardless of their actual symptoms, treatment, and personality.   But I guess my solution is really to differentiate people by being specific, especially about their actions. I don't like the idea of calling a person crazy, as if it's some sort of immutable characteristic. But I can see the logic of calling some actions crazy. I do feel like that is a last resort, as I'd rather people be more specific. Yeah, a lot of the actions we see from mentally ill people are pretty outside the norm, and pretty classically crazy or insane. But the word has lost so much of its meaning that I think we can do better to talk about their actions in other ways."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,HappyonaShelf,7,Fri Jul 11 00:00:15 2014 UTC,"It's amazing to me that you think people with mental illness generally have a treatment plan. Working class people, by and large, very often don't have that luxury."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,meldolphin,3,Fri Jul 11 02:18:25 2014 UTC,Trufax.  Although I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt since they might not be from the US.
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,meldolphin,5,Fri Jul 11 03:28:10 2014 UTC,"Definitely agreed.  And the media certainly doesn't help.  Look at Amanda Bynes.  Because she was really only hurting herself she was a laughingstock, but the second someone goes on a shooting spree everyone starts falling all over themselves about how they were just ""mentally ill"" and we need to take better steps on mental health.  It's like nobody cares about us until it affects society in some way.  They don't care about the person they just want to feel like they're being productive somehow.  So that's my major beef.  Nothing wrong with trying to help people out but once you start making assumptions that the shooter was mentally ill it pisses me off.  It's also terrible journalistic integrity but that's a different story."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,keakealani,3,Fri Jul 11 00:08:39 2014 UTC,"A-fucking-men. I agree completely that mentally ill people are seen as expendable in the media unless they hurt someone else. Which is one of the reasons people delay getting help - because if they're hurting themselves, everyone just laughs it off and ignores it, even if it could potentially lead to them hurting other people in the long run. (Not to mention, hurting oneself is still really unfortunate and should be treated as a serious concern even if the risk of hurting others is small.)  But yeah, I actually wish the original article had touched on this more -- a BIG reason why the ""crazy"" label is SO harmful is exactly because of the way it exacerbates the stigma and stereotypes. The author nods at it in the end of the article, but I definitely feel like that should be the main point. It's not just that ""crazy"" is gendered and has a lot of issues with potential sexism, but it's first and foremost incredibly counterproductive and hurtful to people with mental illness."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,meldolphin,3,Fri Jul 11 00:16:15 2014 UTC,"It becomes circular from conformation bias.  Well X did something bad and they had a mental illness.  Y just did something bad so they must have a mental illness.  It's a rude thing to speculate about, especially when it's people with no experience with psychology."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,bisbest,5,Fri Jul 11 00:29:22 2014 UTC,"""A whirlwind of hate hellbent on lashing out at everyone else"" would be a spiteful, or maybe vindictive, person.  A woman who's constantly harping on her exes would be ""fixated"" or ""hung up"". A clingy woman who's threatening suicide to get her ex back could be called ""attention-seeking"".  There's almost always a more descriptive word or phrase than ""crazy"".  Personally, I find it useful to look for these words because it helps me figure out exactly what is bothering me.  Which makes it easier to figure out what I should do about it."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,meldolphin,6,Fri Jul 11 00:01:32 2014 UTC,"You definitely bring up some good points about more specific terminology, although I'd hesitate to call someone threatening suicide ""attention-seeking.""  It's a bit controversial but some psychologists believe that people with Borderline Personality Disorder will threaten suicide as a lashing out behavior and to me that's not really attention-seeking.  And I think in some cases it's hard to tell what people's intentions are.  Are they self-harming and threatening suicide for attention or are they genuinely upset?  Calling someone who is genuinely suicidal ""attention-seeking"" is really dangerous.  Even if it seems like that it is much safer to assume that they are serious."
FemmeThoughts,2ac9qr,bisbest,5,Fri Jul 11 00:15:00 2014 UTC,"I should have been clearer. I was referring specifically to a situation where someone is manipulating others with suicide threats.  I would agree, though, that those cases are probably a small minority, and any threat of suicide should be treated as though the person is serious."
FemmeThoughts,2adba6,IHasComput0r,9,Thu Jul 10 21:40:37 2014 UTC,"Honestly it gets easier with practice. If you're getting danger vibes from a person it's totally understandable to just remove yourself from the situation. But if you feel like it would make you feel more in control to say something, a stranger in a populated place is a really good place to practice standing up for yourself however you feel comfortable.  A super non-confrontational way to handle it is to cross your arms over your chest. Or hold up a book or large purse in a way so that it obscures your chest. It doesn't work for super-creepers who want you to feel uncomfortable, but gets dudes who think they're being subtle to stop, as well as the occasional person who didn't mean to stare but was distracted by boobs.  Slightly more confrontational, but still fairly easy to move past (ie less embarrassing for the starer than calling them out directly, if that's the direction you want to go in)- saying ""Excuse me"", ""You're making me uncomfortable"". ""Can I help you?"", ""My eyes are up here"" (especially if you're talking to them, it's not as harsh as it sounds when you just keep the conversation going once you've said that), or directly staring at them so that they know they are not being subtle. Again, these will separate the ones who want to creep you out from the ones who are just being ignorant or spacey.  This stuff really depends on how dangerous it is where you live. I mean, I've certainly heard that you shouldn't look anyone in the eye in the NY subway, but in Canada where I live, the worst I've personally gotten in response to calling a guy out on leering is yelled at. I've been spit on and swung at a few times for turning down dates at a bar, but have only been (very rarely) yelled at for calling out leerers on public transit and in malls and school. So definitely be aware of and listen to any feelings of danger you may have, but it isn't always as dangerous or confrontational as you might think.   I'd say 80-90% of people (men and women) apologize to me or look away seeming embarrassed. Those people mostly responded to the least confrontational methods, but some were really lost in thought in my boobs until I out and out said, ""Excuse me... You're making me uncomfortable."" My SO and I joke that boobs must have hypnotic powers because of how deeply lost in thought they sometimes seem to make people.  Of course how you're treated will also depend on your race and any racial stereotypes in the area. I'll lucky enough to be white, so that can definitely affect the outcome of those interactions.  Some people might say something like you fear in response, or yell at you. In my experience it's pretty rare. Then it's split between dangerous yellers and temper tantrum yellers. Personally I feel pretty confident in telling the difference from a long history in customer service and a habit of telling people being inappropriate towards me that their behavior was inappropriate. I don't worry too much about the few who have said that I deserve it, because I have a natural talent for not caring about the opinion of assholes.  Basically I'm trying to give you an idea of some potential strategies you could use, and the reactions you might expect. If you feel safer by letting them know they are making you feel bad, then by all means try whatever makes you feel better. If you feel safest by avoiding those people, then leave the situation and vent. Whatever you do, please don't listen to people who would tell you that how you choose to handle it is wrong, and definitely don't listen to any assholes who would try to blame you for their own inability to act like civilized human beings. I hope you find a way that makes you feel more comfortable."

FemmeThoughts,2adba6,AwkwardBurritoChick,5,Thu Jul 10 21:52:39 2014 UTC,"So glad to read this as this is the first thought I had.. stare back, blankly for a few seconds, enough to know you're vision is targeted on him to see how long or if he reacts.  Then say, next time he turns around... ""Excuse me, can I help you?"" ""Or is there a problem?""  It's perfect because it's not confrontational in a direct manner, but you notice his behavior, and gives him a ""yes"" or ""no"" response.   Heck, if you weren't so shy I'd suggest to say the next time he turned around ""Seriously? Stop.""  In a public setting, this will also bring others to the attention that you are overtly noticing he's not behaving 'normally' or rather, inappropriately.   Or simply do something more discrete like go to adjust your blouse, using only your middle finger."

Much like how in order to win eight hour work days (instead of 12 or 16 hour days six days a week), or win safety rights for workers, or end end child labor workers fought back. They died by government guns when National guard was ordered to fire on them, they died when clashes with police became riots, and when company thugs beat them t death. I hope we never see that, but we may. In the miners strikes the company would find where the miners his their children and bury those children alive as retaliation. We talk ourselves the world is much more civilized, that we don't need to organize, we don't need labor unions, we keep saying and repeating that we're beyond that. Progress! But it's all the same.

As automation encroaches and capital funnels to the owners at faster and faster rates we see the shift. It's a shift away from politics and social structure that included working people and now one dominated, engineered, and marketed by Capital to keep the odds stacked in their favor. Especially with recent rulings, corporations now having the same freedom of speech and freedom of religion as people. With the tax advantages of incorporating and the business shelters of invest in in assets to lower profits (and thus more taxes) corporations actually have more freedoms than persons.

FemmeThoughts,2abfl6,HumanMilkshake,1 point,Fri Jul 11 19:34:33 2014 UTC,"In 50 years? I imagine most people will be dying.  So, the oceans are a major place the Earth stores excess atmospheric CO2 and because climate change is a result of excessive amounts of CO2 getting pumped into the atmosphere, that means there's a lot more CO2 in the ocean than normal. This excess CO2 is making the oceans much more acidic. Infact, every estimate I've seen has it that the ocean's acidity is going to triple in the next hundred years. Right now they're in the ""basic"" range of a ph scale, and will still be basic in a hundred years, but this is still going to be bad.  The increasing acidity of the world's oceans is hard on ocean life. The base of the ocean's food chain is plankton, and the increasing acidity of the oceans is already killing them because the oceans are now dissolving their exoskeletons.   This process (called 'Rapid Ocean Acidification') is really bad for basically all life on Earth because plankton are the world's largest converters of CO2 into O2. The lowest estimate for their contribution is 50% of earth's breathable O2 is a result of plankton. The most common estimate is 75-85%. The last time there was Rapid Ocean Acidification there was this thing called ""the KT Extinction Event"", where 75% of all species on earth just died.  So, I imagine in 50 years a lot of us will be dying.  ETA: Also, automation has really nothing to do with hitting a post-scarcity economy, for that you would need 100% recycling and a lot of magic, because I don't think you could find a single economist who thinks a PSE is even possible. And increasing automation isn't going to cause mass unemployment either. You still need people in service jobs and to design and repair the automation equipment. There's a reason the industrial revolution didn't cause mass unemployment, despite what Luddites claimed."

FemmeThoughts,2a7x9c,wifeofcookiemonster,22,Wed Jul 9 06:47:55 2014 UTC,"Flirting vs Sexual Harassment   I draw the line between sexual harassment and flirting at reciprocation and escalation.  In flirting, party A makes a small initial gesture of interest (say a smile, or flirty look) and waits for party B to respond.  B reciprocates and escalates (smiles back and adds a flip of the hair). A escalates again, asking a cute and flirty question. B touches A lightly on the arm.    In sexual harassment, there is no reciprocity.  A keeps doing things without B returning.  Some people will say it's hard for A to tell if B's actions are reciprocating or polite, but I just don't believe that's true.  I have never had a hard time telling a polite response from flirty one, and especially not a cold response from a flirty one.  Friendly responses can be a bit more difficult, esp if B doesn't know A is flirting, but there will reach a point where it's clearly not reciprocal. Picture hugging a child that wants to be hugged vs one whose mother is clearly making it hug you.  It is an obvious difference.  Another point about sexual harassment is that it often escalates very quickly or starts at a high level of intensity. Especially harassment from strangers often begins with lewd language or physical touch, and there was no escalation there to gauge whether or not you were interested in escalating things.  Sometimes, especially with superiors or acquaintances, it goes from a friendly, maybe flirty smile, and skyrockets to graphic sexual content.  B may have been fine with a flirty smile or look, but the whole escalation where B would have drawn a line gets skipped.  And the easiest way to tell is that if B ever says they are not interested, and A persists with the ""flirting,"" it is sexual harassment.     Admiration vs Objectification    This is one I run into a lot. I have a very visual sexuality, but I have worked incredibly hard to control my eyes and thought life.  I don't follow the ""would what you are doing make you uncomfortable if the roles were reversed"" rule, because it's too easy for me to say ""I'd love it if she looked at me like that.""  If this rule is to be followed, picture someone intimidating and unattractive and ask yourself how you would feel if this person was doing what you are doing to you.  It's a better gauge.  My rule is keep it with a smile and keep it under three seconds.  I think it is totally possible to admire that someone is attractive without turning them into an object for viewing pleasure.  If you start running a graphic narrative in your head about what you'd like to do to them, if you start imagining without clothing, if you are ""stealing"" looks down blouses or up skirts that aren't supposed to be seen, that is wrong.  It does take some self control, but coming from a lesbian who had to learn how to not be a creep in a girl's locker room, it is possible.  At the end of the day, their comfort and privacy and ability to go about their activities was much more important to me than getting my jollies off.  I think that as long as you are thinking about how they are feeling about you viewing them, you are going to be fine.  Just the action of taking that perspective makes it hard to objectify them.  Effects of hyper-sexual-objectification  It sucks. A lot.  You're talking to 11 years of eating disorder recovery here, so I am probably not the best person to talk to about it.  I hate every single day that this occurs.  The only solution I've found is to be mad instead of sad.  If I can find a news story that really gets the indignant wind billowing through my righteous sails, I can remind myself how fucking ridiculous the whole thing is and it makes me angry instead of insecure or blue.  If I can take a more extreme example of this stupidity, it highlights the smaller examples and I can rage at them instead of internalizing them.  For example, reading an article about the effects of fashion magazines on young girls makes me notice every instance of photoshop and unrealistic beauty standards throughout the day, and rather than feeling sad at the end of the day because I'm not beautiful like those posters, I am furious that this exists. TRP stuff is fantastic for rage inducing.   It's obviously not ideal, and it can get exhausting, but it's all I got."
FemmeThoughts,2a7x9c,lavenderblue,2,Wed Jul 9 13:18:17 2014 UTC,This is beautiful and insightful. I would let you check me out in the locker room if you talk feminist to me :-P
FemmeThoughts,2a7x9c,rationalomega,6,Sat Jul 12 22:23:20 2014 UTC,"I mean, by definition anytime you're looking at someone and admiring their looks you're objectifying them, at least a little. We're human, we like looking at attractive people, we like feeling like we're attractive people.  The line where it becomes inappropriate (for me) is when my looks are:    Expected of me, ie I'm supposed to be looking attractive and on display at all times instead of grocery shopping in my comfy pants and a ponytail.  My looks become more important than my skills. I mean, it's good to look professional at work, but I shouldn't be passed over for a job because of the way I look. The subject of unwanted or unasked for opinions of my looks from either men or women. It's one thing for a friend to tell me I look nice or hey, that shirt isn't exactly flattering or your only filled in one eyebrow this morning. It's even okay if someone says they like my sweater and want to know where I got it. It's completely different if a man starts telling me I'm pretty or sexy, or conversely starts telling me I'm not pretty or sexy. Same for women. I don't care if you think I look slutty or not. Just don't comment on my apparences ever.   If someone wants to flirt, they need to take in the context of the situation and really think about whether or not it's appropriate. On the bus after work... no. At a bar... give it a try. If the person seems uninterested or says no, then move on. That's where the line between flirting and being creepy is.  Also, being sexy is to gain the attention of other people, so if you're being sexy, don't feel like it's wrong to want men to look at you. I mean, if you didn't what would be the point? To be sexy for yourself? Okay then.   Lastly, there's not some narrow definition of what's ""fuckable."" People have all kinds of relationships and sex and they look all different kinds of ways. Don't fall into some trap of thinking just because you don't fit a certain mold you're not completely fuckable. You are and there's a partner out there who is into you regardless of what you look like. Don't worry about the assholes.  TL;DR Do what you want."
FemmeThoughts,2a7x9c,MarthaGail,4,Wed Jul 9 17:40:02 2014 UTC,"In response to your discomfort with ""trying to be sexy,"" I think the best way to go about it is to do what comes naturally. Ask yourself what YOU find sexy rather than looking outward for that definition. It takes some soul searching, mind you, but ultimately it should be rooted in what makes you feel like you are at your personal best.  Some people are inherently more sexual than others. At the point that you are emulating behaviors because that's what you think men want, or you are engaging in behaviors that are making you uncomfortable, you should probably reevaluate what you're doing. Being sexy for yourself is about doing what makes you feel confident in your own skin. It's something that you decide for yourself and can vary throughout your every day life, and that's totally fine.  Additionally, the definition of what makes one 'fuckable' is anything but narrow! We live in a world where there are unlimited preferences, ideas, fetishes, and ways of expression. Everyone is different. The best thing to do is examine what turns you on and try to find others who's interests are aligned with yours."
FemmeThoughts,2a7x9c,astrocats,2,Wed Jul 9 17:16:56 2014 UTC,"I think people have covered most of these pretty well already but in the end a lot of it comes down to body language and paying attention to how you are making people feel.  Some of this stuff is just gut reactions.  Maybe you try something flirty with one guy and he enjoys it and maybe you try the same thing with another guy and he doesn't like it.  Just start small and gauge their reactions.   I'm totally guilty of objectifying guys and if I see a hottie, let's face it I might start fantasizing about stuff.  I don't think your thoughts should ever be held against you.  We've all thought about inappropriate things, like revenge fantasies and the like.  As long as you aren't hurting anyone it's all good.  So catching a sight of a cute guy is fine but staring him down or cat-calling or whatever is not OK.  And you know, I'm sometimes guilty of dressing a certain way because I do want male attention.  Most of the time it's for myself but every now and then I want heads turning.  Occasionally I start feeling uncomfortable about it.  Like, am I just looking for attention?  Is that a bad thing?  And then I say fuck it and strut around and bask in it.  If you're uncomfortable about something you don't have to do it but there's nothing wrong per se about catering to the male gaze sometimes.  If you want to dress sexy for yourself do that and if you want some attention from the boys don't feel guilty about that either."
FemmeThoughts,2a7x9c,meldolphin,2,Wed Jul 9 21:44:13 2014 UTC,"I don't know that I can add much to the already wonderful answers here, but I just wanted to point out that the fact that many women feel uncomfortable expressing their sexuality is, itself, a power of a male-centric world. It's also related to slut shaming - basically, it's become okay in society to judge women's sexuality and physical expression, as if it's any of our business.   I mean, yeah. There are complicated self-evaluation questions about whether your desire to be sexy is purely about personal needs and not because you're feeling pressure to do so, but I think it's important to also remember that it's nobody's business to enforce how you express your sexuality, as long as it's not hurting anyone. (And people here have great advice for how to handle the potentially hurting-people types of sexuality, like escalating to sexual harassment.)  Anyway, I'm not sure I have better advice, but I think it's really important to give yourself the room to explore your own needs and desires without putting too much focus on the potential disapproval of society. Society is pretty sex-negative, on the whole, so I think you can't win if you play by society's rules. That doesn't mean to completely scrap customs and traditions, but try not to focus on it too much."

I spent a lot of time talking to myself, as I would to a young child.  Eventually, the positive things I knew to be true about me sunk in and I felt much better about myself.  One thing that helped me was learning that abusers often take your strengths and accuse you of being the opposite.  When I discovered that, I knew I was a strong, smart, capable woman, because I'd been hearing the opposite for so long."

Seriously, we split up on a Tuesday, he stayed in a hotel for a few days, and then I took him to the airport on Friday and he left the country.  On Saturday, I woke up, and it was like the dark curtains that surrounded me were gone, and sunlight was streaming into my life.  I said (out loud, and with some surprise) ""I'm back!"", and I was.  Then I had to do a lot of hard work on myself, and I did it alone.  Lots of tears, lots of reassuring myself that I was a worthwhile human, lots of staring at myself in a mirror and telling me that I was beautiful.  I listened to Pink's song ""Fucking Perfect"" and cried every day for a few months.  I grieved the death of the life I was supposed to have had, and found new ways to challenge myself (paragliding lessons, built a chicken coop).  I met a man who supported me though all of this, and is still by my side.  I gained the respect of my children who had been told for years (and believed) that I was an incompetent moron.  Part of that was making a big Thanksgiving dinner all by myself for them, and buying and raising a puppy, and turning my house from a cluttered mess into a nice, stylish space.

More importantly, I've recently discovered that I don't need a man, a marriage, or a big white wedding to feel complete and happy. Now that's not to say that I'm not also in the happiest relationship of my life.  I just came to a point in my life about a year and a half ago where I was really unhappy. It was a process, but eventually I decided that I was beautiful, even though I had gained ten pounds. I was smart, even though I had an average GPA. I could be successful, even though I hadn't landed my dream job yet. Bottom line, I stopped comparing myself to this impossible person I made up in my head and that had been crammed there by the media, and instead decided to be myself.  So I don't have a million female friends? Who cares, I have family and I'm successful. So I don't look like a model in a swimsuit? Who cares, there's always someone bigger than you or smaller than you, and everyone looks better in Photoshop. Life's too short. I could get hit by a bus tomorrow and I don't want my final thought to be ""how many calories was that coffee I had this morning?""

It was the first time I was away from my emotionally manipulative mother, and once I was away from her influence and surrounded myself with caring people, I just began to feel better about myself. Not only that, but I finally went to seek help about my anxiety and depression (what a double whammy to have been stuck with as far as mental illness goes. A lot of the time I would skip class to stay in bed because I could not muster up the motivation to go to class... while simultaneously panicking because skipping lecture meant my grades would suffer, and they did).

There are many things that affect self esteem that we don't have a lot of control over but I try to focus on the things that I can control so if I work hard at those things, I tend to feel good even when they don't go my way. Maintaining a diversity of pursuits has also helped me - when my studies are going poorly I can still feel good about progressing in rock climbing or having a solid relationship with a guy I love. The only other thing that seems to help is making sure I'm with people who appreciate and like me and downplaying time I have to spend with negative people. And, like another commenter said, getting older just decreases the fucks I give about potentially negative opinions people might have about me. I've come to realize they have little or no effect on me and that overall, people are a lot less harsh than you think.

Today, I try to explain my thought process of that time to people in this way:    I think I'm awesome. Someone else doesn't think I'm awesome. This is a fundamental difference of opinions. Clearly, that person and I have nothing in common, so I shouldn't let their opinion impact me; furthermore, it's a shame they are so impaired to the awesome things in life, but that is their life choice, it is a valid life choice, and I leave them to it.    It sounds kind of silly (and maybe a bit elitist?) but I swear, I thought it in the most sweetly, naively genuine way possible when I was younger - no malice meant, just ""Oh. I'm sorry you feel that way. You're clearly wrong, but that's perfectly fine; I'm going to go back to my friends now.""  It definitely got me through what could have been some very debilitating social situations, although it did become a bit of an opiate and let me get a bit more overweight than is advisable (I'm setting that straight now!), but it's left me as an adult woman who is very confident in herself, able to lead or follow in equal measure, and unafraid to voice her opinion (although now I can do much better than, ""I'm sorry that you're wrong but that's okay."")."

Part of the problem with /r/all influxes on subs like TwoX was that they did not have enough active mods and they had loose modding policies. That's not an issue we have.  And we're still a pretty small community. There are a lot of women on reddit who don't know about us, and getting some posts to hit /r/all is advertising that can't be beat. It's also a good indicator of how our community shapes up size and activity wise, which frankly is useful to have.  We're still a long ways away from there. And before we ever hit all, we'll hit the list of trending subreddits, which there is no way to opt out of. Personally, I'd really love for us to hold off on this decision. We'll get a good indicator of how external traffic will hit us from when we first start to his trending subreddits. If it goes poorly, we can choose to opt out then.   The thing is, if you have a super strong team of moderators, /r/all is not that bad. Especially as it looks like there will be an update to tools that allows mods to view each comment as it comes in (it's very difficult and clumsy to do right now). We're way away from hitting /r/all or even trending subs. I'd like to wait until we get further along to decide.   We have no idea how that advertising will hit us, and we'll get a good preview when we first start to hit the trending list. At the moment, it feels premature to do anything. But I want to assure the community that no matter what we do, we will keep up the strong moderation and we will not loosen our modding policies."
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,rationalomega,17,Tue Jul 8 20:24:24 2014 UTC,"Good modding will address 3/4 of the problem, but there's really nothing you guys can do about cruel PM's, right? The only protection against those is thick skin."
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,rationalomega,12,Tue Jul 8 21:25:23 2014 UTC,"That's an excellent point. No, we're pretty limited there. If you do get a cruel PM and you think it originated here, please, please, please let the mods know. Or if you think you have a stalker. We're really proactive about this stuff but we need you to let us know if there is a problem.  PMs are my largest concern, and I think it'll likely be the thing that forces our hand here. But I only have second-hand info. I don't know how much cruel PMs come simply from exposure, and how much it's an escalation of behaviour allowed by weak modding.    From what I've noticed as a user and as a mod, most bad PMs come from people who leave nasty comments and then escalate behaviour. And when we ban then for those nasty comments, it seems to really divert that behaviour. Instead of going after users, then send awful modmails or PM the mods personally.    But this is an issue we're very sensitive too, especially after recent reddit changes have made early detection of this behaviour harder.   Honestly, I think we're likely going to opt-out. I'd just like to take a wait and see approach. We'll get good data from whenever we hit trending, and that'll give us plenty of time to choose. I only have data on how this has affected other subs as a subscriber. And things are much more nuanced as a mod. Maybe we're conflating poor moderation issues with higher traffic issues. Or undirected traffic issues with higher traffic issues. I don't know, and I won't know, we won't know, until we actually get data.  If we could opt out of trending, all/new and all/comments then we'd be having a very different discussion. But we can't. At the moment, we can only opt out of regular all. Which means we're going to be getting increased traffic and increased undirected traffic from these other sources anyway. That'll give the mods actual data as to how this affects us and let us make a more informed choice."
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,rationalomega,9,Tue Jul 8 22:11:58 2014 UTC,"A lot of really bad PMs originate from drive-bys. (I originally called them lurkers but they don't even lurk, they just harass). They don't want to have their ""conversation"" out in the open. You look at their post history and it is clear they don't participate in the forum or fora like it. They almost certainly just happened upon a title they disliked and sent a harassing message to the OP. In my admittedly limited experience, the subs that are safest are the ones that are most carefully hidden from the broader reddit community."
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,rationalomega,5,Tue Jul 8 22:32:07 2014 UTC,That's so depressing in light of our desire to get more women on board and participating while not wanting to expose our users to redditors-at-large unnecessarily.
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,AdumbroDeus,9,Tue Jul 8 22:53:29 2014 UTC,"Agreed, sadly. I know I could be doing more ""evangelical"" work (that's how I found out about this sub)."
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,rationalomega,6,Tue Jul 8 22:56:41 2014 UTC,"It's gotten harder and harder on 2X as the community degrades. I still add people as approved submitters sometimes, and I throw our name out others.   We could make an actual post, but I still feel like that's too loud.  It went OK when /u/hermithome did, so maybe I'm too cautious."
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,rationalomega,7,Tue Jul 8 23:00:48 2014 UTC,"true2x, blackladies, prochoice, feminism are all subs I participate in where a post like that would probably get good play.

FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,MarthaGail,2,Wed Jul 9 00:41:07 2014 UTC,"I have to ask, why were you banned?"
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,hermithome,6,Thu Jul 10 13:50:58 2014 UTC,"Yes and not. I'd absolutely agree with you summary, but I'm not sure I agree with the premise, or the implied conclusion.    I've been working a lot on various anti-creepy PM techniques. And I've spent a lot of time working on tracking certain types of behaviour.   And I've noticed that a lot of PMs that seem to come from nowhere, well, that's not quite accurate. I'm come up with a few good techniques for predicting problems ahead of getting a PM. And a lot of PMers dip their toe in the comments first. A lot of this isn't visible to users because of how we screen comments. And a lot of it isn't visible because users often use two accounts. One for commenting and another for sending PMs. It's hard to notice just going off personal experience, but as a mod, I see the PMs of every user who contacts us to let us know they picked up a creep in our sub. And I can see the various deleted comments as well.  When you get that data from a lot of users, you can see those patterns better.  But aside from that, the real question is what kind of traffic is the most problematic. Yes, the higher profile the community the more bad stuff. That's just an obvious numbers thing. But how much of that comes from undirected traffic, well, I don't know. I have a hunch that a lot of it comes from directed traffic. The problem is that there are a number of anti-feminist, anti-woman communities on reddit. And they often watch and harass the women's reddits. Meaning, they actively look for us and lurk and harass. So every time we advertise to women, we also end up advertising to harassers.  Whereas, traffic from all, all/new, all/comments and trending -- that's not directed traffic, that's undirected traffic. We hit a lot of people interested in us (for both the right and wrong reasons) and lot who aren't. The admins are giving us the option to opt out of one of these avenues of undirected traffic. But only one. So either way, we're going to have to deal with undirected traffic as the sub gets more popular. The question is whether it's the undirected traffic that's really the main source of this stuff, or the directed traffic.  I don't know really. There are a lot of hunches and theories, but I don't know of anyone who has collected hard data on this sub. And I'm really interested in collecting that data and finding the best ways to prevent as many problems as possible. I'm working on trying to create more tools to stop harassment, and for me, a huge part of that is breaking down all the angles and trying to get good data. Also, as a mod, I really want to see this sub thrive, and I don't want to cut us off from things that might be beneficial. And I'm highly suspect that hitting all would be more good than harm, but I want to know. I think the more we can measure this stuff the better we'll be at combating it and the better, and more informed our decisions will be.   This is something that's a LONG way off, and I think we can afford to take some of that time to collect data and be more informed. I don't think we'll discover something game changing, but I like to be open and make decisions with the best info when they need to be made. I don't commit before I need to and I like data.  But I want to assure you that we these are concerns that the mods share as well and we're committed to keeping the sub as safe as we reasonably can."
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,miscreantpossum,4,Wed Jul 9 00:31:51 2014 UTC,Thanks for protecting/shielding us I sincerely appreciate your data-driven approach. Science rules! This is a hell of a lot more complicated than I thought.  It is really hard to make a decision on complex systems with uncertain or very little data. Kudos to you for trying to tease it out. I wonder if it is ethical or useful to test some of these hypotheses…?
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,hermithome,3,Wed Jul 9 00:39:24 2014 UTC,"You're welcome. Thank you for being a part of this awesome community! YES!  Indeed. Depends how you test it.    The truth is that moderators are fairly powerless once a sub is public. We can choose how much to advertise to friendly subs and stuff like that, but we can't stop trolls from coming in. There are a lot of things I'd like. I'd like to be able to enforce upvote only mode on certain threads. I'd like to limit voting to community members. I'd love to test a username obscuring thing, where only confirmed community members can see the usernames of people who post and comment. Or maybe a tool where you need to give someone permission to PM you before they have that technical ability. Or what about making it even easier to hide stuff? One click and you could avoid ever seeing a post from that sub again. One click and you could add words to your ignore list. If we make it easier to ignore stuff that people don't want to see, does that help? Disable voting off of all/new. Disable voting off of sub/comments. There are so many tools I'd love to play with. But we don't have them. We can control who can comment; we can screen, delete and ban.That's pretty much it. So we're fairly limited, and a lot of the tools we're using are psychological. How can we deter this type of behaviour? We know that even small changes that makes these behaviours harder to pull off are HUGE deterrents. So we're trying to play with our limited powers. And I'm trying to collect as much data as possible. Both so we can be better mods, and so when I do go and submit an idea to the admins, I have data to back me up.  I'm also really interested in the behavioural aspect. There's a tonne of research I'd love to do. I want to do surveys and get good numbers and hear directly from the horses mouth. And I'd really love to set up a website and experiment with which types of barriers provide the greatest impediment to harassment without drastically effecting most normal use.  Unfortunately, I do not have the money to do this kind of research, much as I'd like to. I hope I'll be able to at some point, or that other people will work on this stuff. I am working on a creep PM prevention tool, but it's a ways off yet (it also works from a defensive standpoint which I think is less than ideal, but all that can be done at the moment). This is something I'm incredibly interested in, but I can only really do work on it in my spare time. But if I ever win the lotto, I'll be diving into this stuff headfirst. Understanding why people act like this, what spurs them on and what deters or distracts them, I think that's crucial to figure out.   My working theory is that undirected traffic doesn't do much harm. Most people who are disinterested or annoyed aren't going to bother to click, much less comment or PM. And the people who are motivated to take those actions don't just wait for something to tick them off, they're already ticked off and actively search for this stuff. But right now, that's just a theory."
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,miscreantpossum,6,Wed Jul 9 01:52:49 2014 UTC,"Such good ideas. I'm not a web developer, but I know enough about it to think that everything you describe could be implemented, in theory. In a meta sense, if Reddit really wanted to be a more woman-friendly place, they could implement some of these options for mods."

FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,RampagingKittens,7,Wed Jul 9 02:40:54 2014 UTC,"Question: If you opt in and then find that we're being invaded by trolls, can we opt back out?"
FemmeThoughts,2a5j30,ResistEntropy,9,Tue Jul 8 21:00:08 2014 UTC,"It's not an issue of opting in. By default, all subs are opted in. They're just now testing an opt-out feature.  But yes, if we don't opt-out and we find that hitting all is too problematic, we absolutely can opt-out at any time. What I'd really like is for the mods to evaluate this in more detail once we start hitting the trending subs list, which will be like a little preview of what we can expect. It'll help us evaluate how well we're modding, whether we need new mods and whether or not we think the greater visibility of /r/all will be worth it or not."

Two things can happen: either a) they stop and I finish my point, or a) we both continue to talk at each other while not hearing the other person.

Most require students to bring their own equipment. A mat costs around $20; lululemon yoga pants, $82.   I couldn't tell from this article if they got their data from people who attend yoga at ""yoga studios"" or people who do it at a gym where you pay a monthly fee and then attend all the classes you want for no extra charge. $17/class is steep for an activity you need to do on a regular basis to really get the hang of.  I live in a fairly diverse working class municipality in NJ. I belong to a gym that costs about $50/month. I do yoga there 1-2 times per week, included in the monthly fee. The class is always diverse just like all the other classes I take at the gym and the gym's member base in general. The gym supplies the mats, so no need to pay for one. Old Navy seems to the brand of choice for workout/yoga clothes at my gym, their items are great quality and a fraction of the price of Lululemon.   Maybe yoga needs not only a more ethnically diverse face, but also a more economically diverse face with people spreading the word about how to practice without breaking the bank?"

Good question. I'm not sure, but I'd guess they looked at individual classes. Memberships are kinda different. Lots of yoga studios have them too, which seriously drives down the price, but you can't get good data that way. Someone who pays X dollars for a monthly or yearly membership often aren't limited in terms of the number of classes allowed. I mean, theoretically, if you have a membership you could hang at a studio all day and take a bajillion classes. So including memberships (of any kind) probably was left out of the data.  This is just a guess but that number seems to jive for individual classes.   I live in a fairly diverse working class municipality in NJ. I belong to a gym that costs about $50/month.

Right, the article really only captured one type of yoga experience. But in many ways, it's the predominant experience. Maybe not the lululemon, but the expensive classes and the like. Driving in well to do neighbourhoods...it's incredible just HOW many yoga studios there are. You go to poorer places and they're mostly non-existent. Also, the number of gyms varies in the same way. There are crazy numbers of gyms in middle to upper class parts of the city and way fewer in less well to do areas. The gyms in cheaper areas also tend to have less variety and less indoor facilities.   So absolutely, economics are a serious part of the issue. And part of the issue is also who we count. But I think tackling the race aspect is pretty important too. Especially after that stupidly racist XO Jane article a while back. That shit is just fucked up and not okay."
FemmeThoughts,2a6g8m,twistedfork,2,Wed Jul 9 00:00:38 2014 UTC,"Community centers may offer less expensive classes, or even if 1 person gets some basic instruction DVDs, learns how to lead a simple class, and starts a meetup group in their home to do yoga. I live in a place where people don't really spend time outside for recreation unless it's beach/pool, but I understand in some places people do want to spend time outside. A meetup group could meet for yoga in a public park in an area like this.  There's 1 yoga studio in my area, and it's $5 per class, it has equipment you can use there, and it's run by a nice older couple that seem like hippies that aren't in it for profit. Otherwise, people do yoga at a gym that costs way less than those expensive studios. I live in NJ, and the gym is a big thing culturally here. So even blue-collar areas like mine have a few gyms to choose from. I could see that maybe in other places where gyms aren't such a big thing, that they wouldn't be found in less expensive areas. That's unfortunate.  I didn't see the XO Jane article you're referring to, but I agree that both race and economics are issues with this."
FemmeThoughts,2a5hn3,katrionatronica,12,Tue Jul 8 15:55:02 2014 UTC,"it's like spitting in an ocean of ignorance      I feel that way about Reddit most days.    No discussion about whether it's disturbing or not, just presumed that historical prevalence makes it OK.       Adults have always been complaining about youth and youth culture. In the 1950s and 1960s, one of the major complaints was that ""rock and roll"" was an euphemism for sex, and the contact during dancing was pornographic depictions of sex. The first written example of complaining about youth and youth culture was in Plato's Euthyphro (written in 399BC) where he's complaining about kids these days (and how this newfangled invention called ""writing"" is making kids lazy because they don't memorize stuff any more).   Welcome to adulthood.   Michelle Shocked's parody of the typical music videos of the 80s (and in particular, a parody of Addicted to Love)."
FemmeThoughts,2a5hn3,Tangurena,5,Tue Jul 8 18:00:10 2014 UTC,"I totally agree, although that doesn't mean that youth culture is automatically awesome, and I think criticism about music videos are valid:  it's not about the sex for me - I don't have a problem with sexually explicit things.  It's about the inequality and objectification.  Right now, being objectified is a sore issue for women (and rightly so) because they have always been objectified one way or another and so I can see how sex in music videos represents some very problematic inequality between genders because of the way that women's sexuality is portrayed in relation to men's.   Furthermore, music videos are all part of the aspirational media - the thing that makes us all feel inadequate so that we can buy stuff that we dont need.   It just feels like a 'same as it ever was' situation   It just seems like that's the endgame of the media right now - whatever makes people feel increasingly inadequate, that's what they go and do next.  It just doesn't seem like a healthy direction t o be going in.    OR maybe it will go in a positive direction: If we're gonna objectify people sexually, can't it be done more equally? Why aren't there more muscles and penises and things aimed at WOMEN in music videos? Why isn't there lots of porn made for female consumption and the female gaze?  If people were objectified more equally, I think it would become a non issue and people would begin to treat each other with more respect while objectifying them - in other words, people would respectfully admire people's sexuality instead - and that would be way more healthy for everyone involved"
FemmeThoughts,2a5hn3,wifeofcookiemonster,2,Wed Jul 9 07:17:57 2014 UTC,"Why aren't there more muscles and penises and things aimed at WOMEN in music videos?      I think Madonna tried that and got a lot of pushback from all walks of life. It started before she published her book, but became very widespread afterwards. My dad watched Fox a lot, and it took years for Hillary Clinton to replace Madonna as Pubic Enemy Number One on Fox.   I also think that there would be more ""things aimed at women"" if and only if people actually buy them. There aren't a lot of bands aimed squarely at women. Ingrid Michaelson is one, she came to Denver twice this year, and I went. I've bought her albums (the only local station that plays her is not a Clear Channel station). Uh Huh Her came to Denver once this year (I missed them). I bought their albums. Indigo Girls are coming to Denver this month and I have tickets (they haven't released an album in years, but I have all of them). The bean counters that run the music companies would sit up and take notice if more folks bought albums and concert tickets: they care about the money. This is a case of ""I put my money where my mouth is"".    Why isn't there lots of porn made for female consumption and the female gaze?     I think I answer some of that over at another thread: http://np.reddit.com/r/FemmeThoughts/comments/2a6zbe/nsfw_ive_never_had_sex_that_felt_like_a_mutual/cis5xq4    Because men tend to be more visually focused, and women tend to be more emotionally focused, I tend to grossly oversimplify things by saying ""romance novels are porn for women"" in order to start a fight discussion. Both are huge industries, both stimulate the ""prurient interests"" and both instill unrealistic expectations in their audience.    If we're gonna objectify people sexually, can't it be done more equally?      I think that straight men fear the gaze from gay men because they recognize that they (the straight men) don't want to get treated by other men the way that they (the straight men) treat women.

I feel good as long as it's monitored. I might be a bit of a hypochondriac, but it makes me feel good to be aware of any changes early.

FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,dictatorcake,43,Fri Jul 4 05:30:04 2014 UTC,"To be honest, it's because we're at the point where people are used to the benefits of feminism, and don't see them as things that need to be fought for.  Women gained the right to vote in 1920. In six years, that will have been 100 years of women voting. There will very likely be no one alive who even remembers a time when women couldn't vote. And women voting just seems normal and how it's always been (because for almost everyone alive right now, it has always been that way), and so we forget that it was once something we had to fight for.  The same goes for being a working woman. Women work now, they are not all homemakers, and we even have a few (not nearly enough) female CEOs. It feels normal that women go to work and do their jobs just like everyone else. People forget that this is something that had to be really fought for.   And when people forget that those are the reasons the fight was started, they don't understand why the fight is still happening. It seems less like a fight for women and more like a fight against men.  At the same time, because women being part of the working world is so normalized, the idea is slowly growing that women are now equal to men. This feels like a good thing, but in many ways it is not. Because women are still discriminated against and harassed every day, often by people who don't even realizing they are doing so (though not always). People still participate in sexist behavior without even realizing that it is sexist. Because women are ""equals"" now, how can this friendly joke be sexist? Or this subconscious assumption that you wouldn't like this violent movie because you're a woman? Or this idea that because you are a woman you're more emotional? That's not sexism, that's just how stuff is. Sexism isn't really a problem, because look, I have female coworkers, and my wife and I both work, and she even makes more than me!   People don't realize the fight that is still to be had. And when you're fighting a fight that people can't see, and it's directly affecting the way that they live and act and operate, they get upset. You aren't fighting for women, you're fighting against men now, and against how things are. Can't you see that women are already on equal ground? We all have the same rights! We're equal, sexism isn't a problem. By continuing to call yourself feminist you are just trying to take rights away from men.  People forget that sexism is still fighting for equality. When it feels like the big fight is over, it's easy to overlook the little things that are still wrong. It's like gay marriage in a way; we will fight until all 50 states allow gay marriage, and then many people will feel like the fight is won. However, just because anyone can now marry does not mean that the lgbt community is not still discriminated against. Why do I need to be married to have all the same rights as straight people? In some parts of states sodomy is still illegal. However, the fight for gay acceptance will have finished its big milestone, and a lot of people will overlook the little problems because of it. That's how feminism is now.  And finally, to add on top of all of this, the internet is like a breeding ground for extremism. Anonymity lets out the most radical ideas without fear of judgement. And so extremists write and write and write to their hearts' content. And often extremists are the ones with the most to say - and the most shocking and attention grabbing things to say. This is true with any group, and it is true with feminism. The problem is that places like reddit are fairly male-dominated. So views that are very anti-male (like extreme feminism) are going to be the most attention grabbing and generate the most hatred. Of course a lot of people will take these views and attach them to the entire ideology of feminism, not just extremism. And then the idea of the ""crazy, bra-burning, man-hating feminist"" is perpetuated as more and more blogs are being shared. And the everyday, average, just wants to not be catcalled, feminist probably doesn't have a blog. And even if they did, it wouldn't be interesting or attention grabbing enough to be shared. And so the everyday feminist becomes buried beneath cries of ""cis scum"" and ""all sex is rape"" from extremists.  So keep identifying as a feminist and being you. People need to see that feminism is alive and well and it's not man-hating or evil. The change will be slow-going, but I think it'll happen. There are enough of us who deserve to be treated as equals. There are enough people who are caring and want change to happen. It'll happen."

Some modern third-wave feminists reject the ""feminist"" label (I've seen ""womanist"" as an alternative) because they feel ""feminist"" is identified largely with second-wave feminist ideals, which ignored a lot of the intersectional stuff that non-WASP women deal with. Second-wave feminism fought for women to have the right to work, but it ignored the women who were already working.

FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,2Xprogrammer,19,Sat Jul 5 01:00:31 2014 UTC,"Because wanting gender equality is still a radical, extreme idea that a lot of people aren't comfortable with.  The difference between ""egalitarian"" and ""feminist"" is ""egalitarians"" like the sound of gender equality but think any practical step for achieving it is too extreme.  This quote is from a more specific incident, but I think it's relevant to feminism at large:   [They're] mad that women are being listened to, that men's voices are no longer given so much power that they can effectively drown out the voices of women. They're mad because they're not the only ones that matter anymore. I get it. To them, it really does feel unfair. Something really is changing. They ARE being demoted — from a superior to an equal — and it feels wrong to them because they're so used to being privileged, to being the most specialest girl in the whole world.   I had read this excerpt quoted in a different article and hadn't realized the spirit of the original NYT post. I'm not sure what I think about its broader message, but this quote is good:   because resources are limited, gains for women and minorities necessarily equal losses for white males. Even if this feels intuitively fair to many, including those white males who are happy to share resources for the greater benefit of the nation as a whole, it must feel absolutely distressing for those who are uncomfortable with change and who have a difficult time adjusting to the inevitable reordering of society.  From the civil rights and feminist movements of the 1960s and onward, young men – and young white men in particular – have increasingly been asked to yield what they’d believed was securely theirs. [...]   Can you imagine being in the shoes of the one who feels his power slipping away? Who can find nothing stable to believe in? Who feels himself becoming unnecessary? That powerlessness and fear ties a dark knot in his stomach. As this knot thickens, a centripetal hatred moves inward toward the self as a centrifugal hatred is cast outward at others: his parents, his girlfriend, his boss, his classmates, society, life."
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,Hubniz,15,Fri Jul 4 13:33:27 2014 UTC,"That last quote made me realize that there's a significant part of the male identity that IS power and privilege. It's manly to be the boss, and weak and girly to just follow what you're told. It's manly to be the one who goes out hunting to feed your family, to be the only one heroically providing for and protecting those weak women and children. In that sense, the feminist movement is emasculating by making power not exclusively male. For a guy who puts a large part of his identity in that idea, how would he react to feminism destroying his perceived place in the world?"
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,2Xprogrammer,7,Fri Jul 4 15:25:22 2014 UTC,"Right. Feminism involves the destruction of patriarchal gender roles. That means a shift away from femininity as domestic, subordinate, docile, nurturing, etc., but it also requires a shift away from patriarchal masculinity that fixates around power, control, aggression, hypersexuality, impulsivity, etc. It's not any more anti-man than the shift away from patriarchal femininity has been anti-woman.  Interestingly, TRP has a tiny bit of this right: Their sidebar complains about ""a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men"". Because feminism exposes the negativity inherent in patriarchal masculinity, it makes it a lot harder to remain entrenched in that masculinity and have that be a positive identity. Their gripe is really with patriarchy, but a failure to promote positive alternative masculinities is a semi-valid criticism of the tactics of the feminist movement through much of its history.  What can feminists do about it now? We definitely need a greater acceptance of the fluidity, complexity, and socially constructed nature of gender, and this reality has to make it into society's collective understanding. Once people understand that being male does not require identification with any static notion of masculinity, the feminist critique makes more sense and seems less like a personal attack. But there may very well be room for a ""masculinism"" movement of some sort, led by men but necessarily aligned with feminism, to engage in the same kind of critical examination and liberatory redefinition of masculinity that feminism has helped women progress toward with femininity."
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,HappyonaShelf,3,Fri Jul 4 20:19:24 2014 UTC,"We've been encouraged for decades to take equality for our due and not to settle for less. Much of this was fueled by despair, forced poverty and other sources of righteous anger.   What it may have been short on is a commitment to mutual respect.  There are so many younger men now who reflexively give women their due, perhaps we're soon going to be able to move beyond polemics.  In the meantime, how do we support women's studies without demonizing men? Because Stockholm women, at this point, can share near equal blame for letting misogyny pass without comment.  Yesterday I saw a female stand up comic railing about women holding the SLOW sign on construction sites getting paid the same as laborers.   Pardon me if I'm off the mark, but wasn't it the prominently male unions who argued that this job is statistically far more dangerous (as in deadly dangerous) and, hence, worthy of equal pay?

Because of the backlash against Feminism. It started in the 1980s as a reaction against the 2nd wave of feminism in the 60s and 70s. Susan Faludi described how it started in the book Backlash.  With the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine back in the 80s, political broadcasts now go unopposed. So certain politically oriented stations/networks become echo chambers, where lies go unchecked and unquestioned. How many Americans still believe that President Obama is a Muslim? Or was not born in the US? As an example of the lies one sees in the echo chamber, when Republican politicians get caught in scandals, the titles on the screen show a ""D"" so that the members of the echo chamber can go ""oh, those evil democrats""   Much of the backlash comes via strawman, reductio ad absurdum arguments and also via shared urban legends. It is the same tactics that were used during the Cold War to isolate and denounce ""socialism"" and unions. It is also much of the same tactics keeping racism alive. So it is the identical logic to get you to ""all feminists are extremists"" as to ""all blacks are scary and going to mug me"". And the backlash against feminism is so effective that you get people starting sentences with ""I'm not a feminist, but...."" and then articulating a feminist position. Or how people stopped at a traffic light will subconsciously press their door locks when a black person is using the crosswalk.   So when the echo chamber claims that X happened because of Y, then it goes unquestioned.   TL;DR - decades of barking heads on Fox and AM talk radio have successfully managed to turn the word ""feminism"" into a dirty word, like they're doing with the word ""liberal""."

FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,sullen_nymph,2,Fri Jul 4 15:01:45 2014 UTC,"In part it has to do with a situation that arises in what might be called over politicizing, in a certain way. This is difficult, because it has a couple of layers, at least. It might sound here like I'm dissing feminism, and I'm not, not eve the most ardent feminism. But I do mean to suggest that there some people for which a complex situation happens, and this is part of a broader, general problem that happens across a number of political or politicized dimensions.  Some people have their political agenda as a bit of a ""personality formation"" issue, with, at times, a decided lack of psychology. So you have someone who has ""issues"", as they say, and attribute their problems entirely to the political agenda, whereas perhaps they are variously narcissistic, manipulative, not ""getting"" certain dimensions of basic human experience and relationships, etc., so the political part comes through with this really exaggerated force and is profoundly repellant to ""normal"" people who simply don't have that kind of distention in their personality. Now, while the downvoters are rushing to click the arrows, I'll explain this more, and show why it's very complicated. Perhaps a few provisos will get the knee-jerk downvoters to just hold off a moment.   Bear in mind, for example, that the ""normal"" (I do use quotation marks here) people may be the most absurdly naive misogynist idiots imaginable. But the point here is that across a lot of basic dimensions of dealing, relating, loving, conversing, interacting, they simply lack much in terms of malfunction, so to speak. They can be idiots, OK?? But they may not have a serious, major personality problem.   Now, add to this the following: some such ""personality problems"" that I am vaguely referring to may still issue from the problems of misogyny, patriarchy (and so much ultimately traces to this matter of dominance), etc. The issue here is more specific personality situations that happen where the person is over-attributing to the ""cause"". This is quite difficult because it may be just plain impossible for a ""regular"" person to relate to such a person. The basic issue at this point becomes whether the problematically ardent feminist (or Leftist or Conservative, etc.) simply has any possibility of self-reflection and psychological reflection at all, whether they can enter into any mode of self-critique in which they can ever say ""my bad"" or ""I have a problem with this"", or ""I'm actually being annoying, even though I still hold that the issues of feminism are quite important"".   But this is a pervasive problem in politicization: there are people who simple don't do much, or at times any, of the heavy lifting of self-attribution, self-reflection, psychological explanation, etc., and chalk all problems up as symptoms of their agenda.  Add to this the following: as a category, feminism is tied in with basic gender identity. It is not like someone who is utterly opposed to putting a dam in in the upper areas above one's town. That person may be ardent, but it's not going to be the realization of a nearly cosmic matter of identity and Being. But feminism is related to the major forces and conditions of gender, power, etc. So when there is a major personality issue (if there is, and it is hard to say this of course), it takes on a most oppressive role in situations in which people are trying to deal with the given activist.   At the same time, I would never take the simplistic tack that uses a facile psychology to dismiss the problematic feminist, such as saying, ""so you had a bad relationship with your father, get over it"". Such personality issues can lead right into an even deeper, more ardent feminism, and it may ultimately be a very good thing to take it right there. The downvoters have probably already done their deed and are probably not reading this, nor are they likely to even be able to realize the consequences of this statement, if taken seriously. For that matter, let me show you just how radically I am willing and able to formulate this by stressing that the negativity expressed in those downvotes are themselves most likely manifestations of a certain patriarchy, in which domination rules and has ruled far too long. That being said, I am nevertheless holding that there should at least be some basic affirmation given to the passage through some degree of self-reflection. If someone has no space in themselves in which they can say ""this is my problem"" at all, there is something wrong. It's just that at this point the cognitive demands are high.  And where cognitive demands are high, the thoughtless will capitalize, until and unless thought comes forth as an emergent value. This is something I hold to. Look at those cognitive demands: I'm saying there has to be some sense of feminism, some sense of self-reflection, some passage through and basic capability of self-attribution, some engagement of basic psychology of relationships, and furthmore, that even then, even after this range of self-incursion, there may be a deeper feminism that comes out the other end of that, one that might only delineate the contours of an even deeper patriarchy, and that a certain oppressive -- and probably patriarchical -- suppression of thought would like this very progression, with its cognitive demands and multiple layers, to be tied up and tossed out, the better to allow an easy downvote, the expression of negative force, the reduction to simplistic categories, etc.  And I say: fuck all that, this is my activism. I've seen it: I've see the personality issues tied in with the over-politicization, and I've see it come out the other end: this person you hate because they are literally an impossible drag on your being, whose political agenda is covering for a serious personality malfunction, is indeed malfunctioning, and often enough, or even in ways that are mind-bogglinglly exponential, this is due to precisely the issue they are on about, even if it is in ways that may go deeper than they can see, or others can see, and even if it doesn't mean that they shouldn't add to things that missing matter of self-reflection and psychology.   This is, in my view, more of the real lay of the land around this kind of issue. It indicts virtually everyone a bit, and forwards a separate cause of thought that will unflinchingly and in an unflagging way admit of all these ""layers"", from the simple political view, to the simple psychology one, to the mixtures of or deprivations of both and either, to the deeper realizations of their causes and dimensions. This is, for all of that, against those who clamor for simplicity, actually not all that complicated, since I summed it up adequately in just this one paragraph.   But I face something, and you do too, if you're going along with this approach -- and I'm radical enough about this cause of thought to say even if you don't -- in staring down (or simply pathetically going up against) this problem of the thoughtless and facile, coupled with the lack of basic psychology. It does become another issue, and one can inflect many categories to hit off the character of the suppression of thought, from patriarchy to perhaps some kind of feminine version of suppression, etc.   In any case I will leave off with saying that there are at least some feminists who are a bit trapped and are impossible to relate to for the average person, where this really has to be seen as being a personality issue to some extent, and this causes a lot of ire and at times it hurts the cause of feminism. At times it helps it, as these malfunctioning people are at the same time at times, at least, all the more brilliant in their fluent critiques of society structures.   Plus, they may actually be right!"
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,DropDeadFred_,2,Fri Jul 4 10:19:10 2014 UTC,"Online, it seems that a few men have stumbled upon radfems on tumblr. They took this extreme of feminism and just assumed it's how all feminists feel. They really think that all feminists hate men and want to subject them to complete emasculation.   They don't understand that feminism truly is about equality for everyone, even if they can't get past the 'fem' part. They don't understand that all the issues they have with feminism are actually products of society and patriarchy.   I suppose it could be the same offline though. Regarding the coming across an extremist and applying it to the entire group."
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,darkslide3000,1 point,Fri Jul 4 13:24:45 2014 UTC,"The problem, in short, is branding.  What I mean: the imagery and thoughts conjured by the word 'feminism' are, for many people, brutally negative. There are two reasons for this:   The widespread and common representation of feminists as being complete assholes. I'm referring to the straw feminist trope. This representation of a feminist is loud, irritating, female, pompous, castrating, and absolutely invested in pushing her extreme, unfair, and/or irrational beliefs onto others, despite these being easy to poke holes in and debunk by whatever audience is around to hear them. Sadly, there are real versions of the 'straw feminist' out there. I have never met one, personally, and I am inclined to believe that they are not numerous enough to hurt feminism as much as negative media portrayal does, but it is only fair to presume that every group has its fringe crackpots, and that these crackpots will inevitably damage their movement's reputation.   In any case, this straw feminist is to the word 'feminism' as the golden arches are to the word 'McDonalds' for many people. When you hear people railing against feminism, they are railing against a straw man, most of the time (in my experience).  How can we change this? My thought is that we should try to fight negative branding with positive branding. Find one good example of the feminist ideal that is sensational and easy to conjure, then promote that specific image as being associated with feminism.  This is easier said than done, of course. Feminism is a very nuanced set of ideals that is constantly evolving with culture and history. Any attempt to cartoon or sloganize it down to a brand device will inevitably fail to capture everything it should stand for. It is also true that it is generally easier to brand something negatively than it is to brand the same thing positively. But I think it would be good to try anyway!  My vote for a positive branding device for feminism would go to this fight scene from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It gets my vote because it captures a lot of what a feminist ideal would look like to me: both female fighters are central and well-developed characters, and you are not prompted to notice their sexuality/femininity/gender at any point during the fight. The fact that they are female has nothing to do with the scene, and should not really even occur to you as it unfolds. It's true that the characters do demonstrate romantic/sexual behavior at other points during the movie (i.e., sexuality is not altogether absent in these characters), but sex is nowhere close to being the defining characteristic of either one. You are prompted to marvel as two incredibly talented actors demonstrate one of the most athletic and beautiful fight scene performances ever filmed, (IMO). The characters are strong and compelling. The actors who play them are talented and celebrated. There is no need to notice or discuss anyone's gender. It does, however, serve to highlight what might be considered insulting or culturally unhealthy about, say, Charlie's Angels. I hope it can be the case one day that people associate feminism with something like this fight scene and the real cultural progress that it represents, rather than shrill, dogmatic 'feminazis.'"
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,Shaysdays,-20,Fri Jul 4 13:40:06 2014 UTC,"I know I'm going to get booed for posting in here as a guy... but then again, why would you ask such a question in an echo chamber anyway?  I can't stand the word feminist, I'm automatically wary of anyone who calls himself that, and I would never apply it to myself. Nevertheless I think that gender equality is as important and fundamental as every other basic human right, and it's sad that it still has to be an issue at all in the 21st century. Of course we should be doing what we can to resolve remaining situations where women are disadvantaged versus men (and the other way around).  If you want to promote and fight for that, hey, more power to you... but why don't you call it gender equality, or emancipation, or, I don't know, anything but ""feminism"". That word has just been butchered and misused and reapplied so often throughout history and innumerable ill-educated conversations that no one really knows what it's supposed to mean anymore these days. (It's kinda like the word ""facist""... people just call each other that in so many different situations for so many different reasons that no one seems to have a consistent understanding of what it's supposed to mean anymore, or what makes it different from a generic term for ""evil person"".)  Of course, you're gonna say that for you the word means such and such which you for whatever reason are convinced is the right interpretation, or that it's ""original"" meaning is such and such, or whatever... but that doesn't really matter, because that's not how language works. It is dynamic and fluid, and meanings can change with use. There are enough people calling themselves feminists today who think that politics should be run by women only, or that a woman's voice should hold more weight than a man's in court, or some other bullshit that is most certainly not reconcilable with gender equality. Even if you're not one of them, using the same term will create association in other people's mind.  The other thing is simply the etymology. ""Feminism"" just has the ""feminin"" front and center as the only thing that matters, which is kinda odd for something that is supposed to be about equality and removing the distinctions. It feels just kinda weird if I want to be supporting equality as a man and I'm supposed to assume a label that completely singles out one side (which doesn't include me). It suggests that there is no such thing as gender inequality against men, and that nobody gives a shit about men at all in the whole discussion. And I'm totally fine with it if 99% of actual gender inequality issues have women as the disadvantaged ones, but it still feels like we should have an all-inclusive label. If you insist on using ""feminism"", you just alienate men who might otherwise be on your side in practical matters... I guess it feels insulting to be considered completely irrelevant to the topic or something. It would just be such a simple thing to change to avoid putting up a barrier between your cause and 50% of the population that might otherwise really want to support it. (The same applies to labels like ""black rights"" or ""gay rights"", btw, which I think are just as poorly chosen.)"

FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,QuietlyItCreptIn,29,Fri Jul 4 07:27:31 2014 UTC,"Ahhhhhohmygod please just stop.   I know I'm going to get booed for posting in here as a guy... but then again, why would you ask such a question in an echo chamber anyway?   First off, nope, you would not be booed for posting as a guy. Did you read the sidebar? ""FemmeThoughts is a casual, comfortable space for women and friends to share perspectives and experiences in relative peace."" I added the bold. You are welcome to be here! But the userbase and conversation is primarily aimed towards women, and that needs to be accepted and women's perspectives or experiences not shamed.   And also, an ""echo chamber""? Really? That's super offensive to the atmosphere of this sub. We have conversation on here and actually are open for debate and thought. We are femmethoughts not femmeomg-the-menz-are-so-dumb-rite??   Then you start off with this to just ease yourself into this space:   I can't stand the word feminist, I'm automatically wary of anyone who calls himself that, and I would never apply it to myself.   gaahhhhhhh what? Seriously, OP has literally made a question asking why people are so averse to the term feminist, and your response is ""well I don't like the term and I'm already judgmental if you refer to yourself as one."" OP is literally asking about people like you and why you assume that feminism is bad without bothering to look any farther than your basic reddit introduction to feminist extremism 101.    If you want to promote and fight for that, hey, more power to you... but why don't you call it gender equality, or emancipation, or, I don't know, anything but ""feminism"".    Why do I say ""feminist""? because I am a feminist. Guess what, I want gender equality, but right now the gender on the bottom is women, and I think that we need to fight our way up. That doesn't mean I hate men or that I think women need to be better or have more rights than men (or take away any rights that men already have), but right now women need the help, so I am on the side of women. It would be like asking someone trying to end slavery, ""well, why don't you fight for everyone and not just people who are black?"" I'm not trying to imply that women now have it literally as bad as slaves but seriously, it's ridiculous to ask why we're not fighting for both sides to achieve equality. Because right now both sides don't need to be fought for, as harsh as it sounds.   That word has just been butchered and misused and reapplied so often throughout history and innumerable ill-educated conversations that no one really knows what it's supposed to mean anymore these days.   Do you know who is butchering and misusing it? People like you, on reddit, insisting that feminism is this dirty word. Just because some people on tumblr post extremist views doesn't make feminism bad. Feminism gave women the right to vote. Feminism gave women the right to abortions (we're still working on it). Feminism gave women access to birth control. Feminism got women out of the house and into the workplace. Feminism is helping to end discrimination against women in those work environments. Feminism is not a dirty thing that needs to be shushed and given a different title.    Of course, you're gonna say that for you the word means such and such which you for whatever reason are convinced is the right interpretation, or that it's ""original"" meaning is such and such, or whatever... but that doesn't really matter, because that's not how language works.   Because of this I want to be absolutely clear: I'm not talking about the language. I'm talking about the real feminist movement. Feminism, in itself as a movement has made huge and innumerable benefits for women. And if for some reason, when you think ""feminist"" you are reminded of people you see posting on tumblr, rather than the fact that less than 100 years ago women in the United States couldn't vote, then that is on you, and not on language. Because honestly, you are being hypocritical. Oh, feminism means something different to me than it does to you, so I should be the one to stop calling myself a feminist. Maybe you need to change your views on feminism. That's not how language works. You can't just insist that your skewed interpretation of a word is more valid than mine.    There are enough people calling themselves feminists today who think that politics should be run by women only, or that a woman's voice should hold more weight than a man's in court, or some other bullshit that is most certainly not reconcilable with gender equality.   There aren't really though. If you go out and meet real and everyday feminists, you will meet really sensible and normal people. Yes, there are extreme feminists, just like there are extremists in any group. That doesn't make those extremists representative of the whole group. Should I stop saying that I'm American, and rather say that I'm from the US? Because for many people, ""American"" conjures up really extreme images of bald eagles and extremely obese people riding on scooters and rednecks shooting guns and hating the rest of the world and thinking we're better. And I don't identify with that. So I should stop calling myself American.    It feels just kinda weird if I want to be supporting equality as a man and I'm supposed to assume a label that completely singles out one side (which doesn't include me).   So advancing the rights of women everywhere doesn't include you at all? You don't have a mother or a sister or a girlfriend or a wife or even a female friend who might benefit from what feminism is trying to achieve? Literally unless it gives you specifically a new benefit, it doesn't include or help you?   It suggests that there is no such thing as gender inequality against men, and that nobody gives a shit about men at all in the whole discussion.   No it doesn't. Just because a women's movement is named after women doesn't mean it hates on men or insists that men can't be discriminated against. Plenty of feminists study masculinity. ""The patriarchy"" hurts men and women, and a lot of modern day feminism is breaking down this patriarchy through new knowledge and education of younger generations. Things like saying ""man up"" or deciding that girls can be tomboys but boys can't be girly are products of the patriarchy, and they hurt men a lot more than they hurt women. Feminism doesn't want that happening, and in no way is calling the movement ""feminism"" invalidating the suffering of men. It's naming the movement after the people who are currently on the bottom rung (if the ladder only had two rungs and one was ""men"" and one was ""women"" - I'm not forgetting intersectionality of race and sexuality and trans* folk withing women's issues).    If you insist on using ""feminism"", you just alienate men who might otherwise be on your side in practical matters.   Why would a man who agrees with me, stop being on my side just because I call myself feminist? Is he really that shallow that because I say I fight for women, he suddenly can't agree with me or help me? Do I want someone like that helping me?   I guess it feels insulting to be considered completely irrelevant to the topic or something.   So pretty much what women have been going through for almost all of the entirety of world history.   It would just be such a simple thing to change to avoid putting up a barrier between your cause and 50% of the population that might otherwise really want to support it. (The same applies to labels like ""black rights"" or ""gay rights"", btw, which I think are just as poorly chosen.)   Yes, how dare we name our movements after the people we are trying to benefit? It's not a secret, black Americans, women, and everyone in the lgbt spectrum are currently being discriminated against. And those movements are helping them and not everyone all at once. If two children are sitting and one has a cookie and the other does not, I am going to give a cookie to only one child. The other one is going to get upset because they didn't ""get"" a cookie - but they already have one. It seems really unfair when people get things and you do not, but you have to step back and realize that they are getting things to equalize the inequality right now. You can't honestly expect to end inequality by literally fighting for everyone. You need to fight for the underdog, and right now the underdog is women.   It's not a simple thing to change, calling yourself a feminist. Feminism is a whole movement with a very rich history. If some people see ""feminism"" as tumblr activism, then that's their problem. I'm not going to stop identifying with a movement that's made real and important change in the world simply because some people get made uncomfortable with the word."
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,Shmaesh,2,Fri Jul 4 15:01:14 2014 UTC,"While I agree with your rebuttal, I think that this fellow described feelings that, although they may be offensive to you,, many people (including myself)  have had, and I appreciate him trying to put that perspective out there! To me it doesn't seem too crazy that a man would feel weird identifying as a ""feminist"" even if he does support their ideals - in the same way that I would feel weird identifying as a ""black-tivist"" (sorry, I know that's a ridiculous term, it's the best I can think of right now!) just because I support the equal treatment of black people, you know? I think a lot of what he mentioned are the exact road blocks we run into with many people who have a problem with ""feminism"" - and just because people shouldn't feel that way doesn't mean we can just dismiss their feelings.  Again, I feel the points you raised are valid and fair , but I can clearly sense that this guy totally pissed you off with his thoughts. He might be wrong, but it also seems like he's actually on our side, so ignoring his concerns or telling him why he's so wrong, isn't really going to do much to further our cause - if anything I'm sure he actually feels more alienated and attacked than before.   Feminism has become a loaded word and SO MANY PEOPLE associate it with the extremely vocal minority that hate men - it's not a huge stretch for me to understand why, especially for a man, labeling themselves might be a bit of a barrier.   Anywho, I just think that his perspective is extremely valid and honestly not too uncommon, and to get angry or just explain away why he's wrong and an asshole isn't necessarily going to help us out. Now, I wish I had something more constructive to say as to HOW to fix the issues he addressed...any thoughts on how to bring someone who mostly agrees with the premise but feels uncomfortable identifying with it around? I think a lot of what you explained was on point about the history etc, but how to navigate the current social climate is a bit less clear to me."

If he's feeling that shallowly about feminism and he's so eager to be driven away by it, was he really going to be a good ally?   Or were we going to spend the entire time he tried to participate in feminism placating his ego and letting the conversation be turned back around from women's rights to his feelings about whatever was going on?  How does this futher feminism in anyway?   Feminism has become a loaded word and SO MANY PEOPLE associate it with the extremely vocal minority that hate men    This is concisely the result of a decades-long smear campaign by sexists and right wingers. If you want to believe the crap they say, that's on you (or the previous commentor, obvs).

FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,killertofuuuuu,-2,Fri Jul 4 10:01:45 2014 UTC,"Okay, my downvote budget is still not full for this month... so even though everyone already started talking about me like some research project on the exam table, I'll head in here one last time to clear up some specifics:  I was not trying to ""participate in feminism"" with my post, or trying to become anybody's ally. Maybe I took a wrong turn and landed in r/feminism by accident, but I wasn't aware that every post and comment in here had to be part of feminism or ""futher [sic] feminism"" by default. All I saw was a totally normal question (as it might have appeared in AskReddit as well, which I think might have been a better idea if you really wanted to gather a broader spectrum of honest opinions), that literally reads ""why do people think I'm an extremist when I call myself a feminist? Why do people have such a problem with the label? I need someone to explain this to me logically"". Just a person who wants to know something, and as I thought I could roughly fit the ""people"" she is asking about (not completely, of course, e.g. I wouldn't go as far as marking everyone who calls herself a feminist as an extremist... I just said ""wary"" in my original post, which means cautious until I get to know more about what he/she means by that), I tried to honestly and objectively explain my viewpoint because I foolishly thought that might be what someone who posts such a question is looking for.  I also seem to get a lot of shit for ""pretending to be in favor of gender equality but only caring about how it affects men"" or something like that. Now I have no idea how one could've possibly read that out of my post (I think I explicitly said at one point that I would believe that 99% of gender inequality issues in practice discriminate against women or something?), but just in case that wasn't clear, my post was not supposed to be a comprehensive essay about my complete viewpoint on the whole field of gender equality, with every subtopic's prominence weighted by how important it is overall. My post was only meant to answer the specific question that this thread is about. So yeah, I talk about how the term excludes men and thus might feel alienating to them, because guess what, a lot of the people OP was asking about are probably men who might have similar associations. I'm kinda confused how you can accuse me of ""turning the conversation around to my feelings"" when the whole question to start with was why I (or rather some people in general, since I didn't really intend to relate everything I tried to explain specifically to myself) feel that way about the word.  Finally, I'm really not interested in your ""reading"", thank you very much. You seem to have misunderstood my whole post as some form of ""I personally believe in all these terribly wrong things, please educate me and show me the light!"". It was really more meant as a ""Hey, since it looks like you want to know why many people (probably most men) can get that kind of first impression, I think this could be what they are thinking and where they are coming from."". You don't need to try to change my mind since you're not going to be able to change everyone's mind at once anyway. You could possibly make people understand you better and thus reduce their animosity by changing the way you formulate and talk about things a little, but you obviously don't seem to be interested in that."

I just think that getting work done and progressing is easier if you break the task of gender equality into smaller bits (such as feminism, LBGT rights etc) - kind if like if you're doing a project at work or school and you break down the larger goal into bite sized peaces so that you can get stuff done.  the human rights movement is massive and there's so much work t obe done that it would go slower if there was just one huge monolith movement, with no direction.   -  I guess it just confuses me when people wont single out groups and support them, as if it means that by supporting one group, you're against the rights of other groups.  It's kind of black and white, all or nothing thinking.  Like if I cant support them all, I wont support even one or two.  Supporting gay rights doesn't mean that you're against straight rights.  I mean you can try, but no one has time to literally, physically go and be an activist for every human right out there, so you just do what you can"

Like by saying you're a feminist you're saying you support women over men. I think a lot of the language is a bit charged that way - like when we say ""patriarchy"" it can sound like this THING that all men are doing to all women, and I'm sure many men feel like it assigns them responsibility for something that isn't really their fault, especially younger men who probably already see women as equal far more than older generations. I think this is a subject where it can be really hard to avoid an ""us vs. them"" mentality because by default you start on one side or the other through no fault of your own - and it can be hard to really be empathetic because we don't really understand the experiences of the opposite sex since our culture really does push the whole ""blue for boys, pink for girls"" even in this day and age! There are pressures men put on other men that I'm just not privy to, and there are pressures I feel that my husband just doesn't ""get""."
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,darkslide3000,4,Fri Jul 4 23:55:29 2014 UTC,"You're absolutely right, I was pissed! And I think something you said kind of encapsulates that:   and just because people shouldn't feel that way doesn't mean we can just dismiss their feelings.   Perhaps I would not have been so enraged and dismissive if he had not immediately been dismissive of anyone who chose to label themselves feminist. He is admitting that he doesn't care for the label, but doesn't understand what real meaning is behind the label, and will automatically judge anyone who uses it. That's incredibly dismissive of any feminist's feelings!   I also don't think he's on the side of feminism, though he doesn't realize it. Let me explain. He says   ""Nevertheless I think that gender equality is as important and fundamental as every other basic human right, and it's sad that it still has to be an issue at all in the 21st century. Of course we should be doing what we can to resolve remaining situations where women are disadvantaged versus men (and the other way around).""   But then he spends the rest of his comment discussing how the word ""feminism"" makes him, as a man, feel left out. He is completely overlooking the fact that women have been left out of history as a whole because they are women. He wants to fight for gender equality, but he doesn't know what that means. He doesn't think about the fact that we still have words like ""mankind"" or that humans as a whole are often called ""man"" (e.g. the dawn of man), terms that are meant to refer to literally all humans ever exclude 50% of them. But he does think about the fact that he feels excluded by the term feminism.   And then his big ""anything you say is actually meaningless"" point was   Of course, you're gonna say that for you the word means such and such which you for whatever reason are convinced is the right interpretation, or that it's ""original"" meaning is such and such, or whatever... but that doesn't really matter, because that's not how language works.   And that's just super offensive and hypocritical! He is not willing to learn what feminism really means, and he is automatically judging someone based on a word that he has derived his own meaning for based on his own biases and interpretations, but suddenly any feminist's biases and interpretations of the word and pointless because ""that's not how language works."" That's so infuriating to me! That shows an unwillingness to learn and and eagerness to dismiss any counterpoints with ""well that's not how language works; the word means something different to me.""  I don't mean to attack but merely give a rebuttal. However I do see that my rebuttal was fairly attacking. I actually got out of bed at 4am to find my computer and reply in full because my phone was going to die. I was passionate about that comment because I meant it.  Someone who is so eager to just dismiss the feelings of someone they've never met is not someone who is on their side. He ""wants gender equality"" but spent the whole comment worrying that men are being left out - of the fight to get women to not be left out.    And I know that it's not an uncommon view, which is upsetting to me. And there was probably a better way to respond, that's true. However, if a man is actually educated on what feminism means, and not simply visiting reddit, where extreme feminist blogs are shared as if they are feminism's holy books, then he shouldn't feel ashamed of labeling himself a feminist. And to actually fix some of the issues he addressed, more men should not feel ashamed to label themselves as feminist! If more men said they were feminist - and acted like they were! - it wouldn't be such a taboo word. It wouldn't be immediately associated with tumblr activism.   And you might be thinking that my response to this man is not a way to get more men to label themselves as feminist. However, when someone comes in, is immediately dismissive, and very defensive of men's rights, on a discussion about feminism, is it going to help anything or get through to them by patting them on the back and saying ""oh well yeah your points about us being wrong and changing everything to make men more comfortable are valid""??? Feminism is called feminism because it is for women, but the fact is that changes made in the name of women are also going to help men. That doesn't mean we change our name, or our core values, in order to make men feel more comfortable with it. I really hope that men could be comfortable with helping women all on their own. Realizing that, yeah, you do have it better than almost every woman, and giving them some equal rights is not a direct insult to you."
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,sophie_hp,2,Sat Jul 5 00:26:25 2014 UTC,"Haha it's hard not to get pissed with issues that strike so close to your heart! I just really was not picking up the same vibes that you did from that particular comment :) Getting away from that specific comment, I have totally run into that attitude before with people, and they weren't bringing it from a nasty place, just a real life place. As a woman it's easy to identify as feminist. Even as a young man in a liberal or academic/college setting I can see it being no problem. But in my (personal and totally anecdotal) experience, when you start straying into different walks of life it isn't so easy. While my husband is completely philosophically in line with feminism, he works at a 100% male blue collar job, and I know that identifying himself as a feminist to those guys would NOT mean to them what it means to us! The word (in my opinion) HAS been a bit twisted and it just doesn't always mean the same thing to everyone who hears it - so then you end up saying it with a disclaimer like ""but I don't hate men!""   I'm not trying to say it's right in the scheme of things, but I think it's really important to try and listen to the people who are being honest with why the word makes then uncomfortable. Plus, and feel free to disagree, feminism IS like the only ""equality"" movement that has decided to pick one of the subsets as it's moniker (or is it? I'm not positive but at least in my life!). With race we don't single out what race we are supporting in the name - it's ""racial equality"" because we support them all.  I don't know where exactly I'm going with this whole train of thought! Just enjoying the discussion! I guess just over all it seems like the feelings that one commenter expressed were feelings that are probably pretty common, so instead of angry I feel more curious as to how we can maybe deal with them!"
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,darkslide3000,-5,Fri Jul 4 18:36:51 2014 UTC,"And also, an ""echo chamber""? Really? That's super offensive to the atmosphere of this sub. We have conversation on here and actually are open for debate and thought.   cough Yeah, I can see that... cough  I didn't even mean to be offensive there, but I think you are very much deluding yourself if you think that the average opinion in this subreddit is in no way biased on questions like that. (Note, ""biased"" doesn't even mean wrong or something like that, it just means that the average is offset to the average you'd get elsewhere.) This is pretty universally true every time you have a niche audience.   gaahhhhhhh what? Seriously, OP has literally made a question asking why people are so averse to the term feminist, and your response is ""well I don't like the term and I'm already judgmental if you refer to yourself as one."" OP is literally asking about people like you and why you assume that feminism is bad without bothering to look any farther than your basic reddit introduction to feminist extremism 101.   Yes, exactly. She was asking why people are averse to the term, so I thought I might help by stating that I am averse to the term and trying to explain my reasons for it. So... sorry for attempting to answer her question, I guess?"
FemmeThoughts,29t0ar,Shmaesh,11,Fri Jul 4 23:40:47 2014 UTC,"The other thing is simply the etymology.

If you insist on using ""mankind"", you just alienate women (and people of other sexes) who might otherwise be on your side in practical matters... I guess it feels insulting to be considered completely irrelevant to the topic or something.

FemmeThoughts,29sn1d,coffee_jeong,11,Fri Jul 4 02:32:05 2014 UTC,"This article is based off a study done by the Frasier Institute. They are a very right wing think tank that heavily endorses privatized healthcare. Healthcare which is not affordable to average Canadians, nor do I think really wanted.   I have to wonder if this is just playing with statistics, and many more would die if we moved to privatized healthcare. In my experience I and those around me have not waited very long for things that were truly life threatening."
FemmeThoughts,29sn1d,anthrogeek,3,Fri Jul 4 03:18:26 2014 UTC,"the article might of been inspired by the Fraser Report, but it does a good job of finding alternate information in the form of Colleen Fuller- Her comments point to troubling inequalities in the Canadian Health Care System.     Colleen Fuller, a health and pharmaceutical researcher who’s worked with Canadian Doctors for Medicare and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, questions the Fraser Institute’s methodology but has no doubt the health care system treats women differently than men. She said the wider issue is access, not wait times.  “The medical system is very patriarchal,” she said. “And not all females are at a disadvantage equally. If you’re older, if you’re racialized, if you’re an immigrant, and now if you’re a refugee, you’ll have more problems.”   Fuller also goes on to point out some troubling stereotypes among doctors such as women's ability to tolerate higher levels of pain and dismissing pain as being psychological in nature.    You are right in claiming that wait times are not an issue.  I wonder if women are getting the full range of care they need."
FemmeThoughts,29sn1d,anthrogeek,9,Fri Jul 4 04:02:22 2014 UTC,"That's a great point, the system is quite patriarchal. I've had a great deal of experience with doctors and every bad experience has been with an older white male doctors, I don't believe that's a coincidence.  There's also a real problem with ableism that isn't on most people's minds right now. I'm not getting a full range of care because of this ableism, but my needs are extraordinary; they should still be met though that is the social contract.    There's just so many holes in the system, but I think we have a pretty good system in place that needs tweaking. The headline just seemed a little alarmist to me and any inclusion of the frasier institute immediately peaks my bullshit meter. They twist stats too often for me to take anything they have to stay at face value."

I know that our system isn't perfect, but I hate when people say that privatization instead of 'fixing the holes/tweaking it' is the solution.  Do people know what it's like to live in a system that's privatized? The socialized system began in the 60's.  My grandmother remembers what it was like before it.  She said that people went without a LOT because affording healthcare is very difficult on an average salary.  I just think that access to healthcare (you don't have access if you cannot afford it in a privatized system) is a human right."

FemmeThoughts,29p9xu,Amonette2012,4,Thu Jul 3 09:18:59 2014 UTC,I have no idea what happened with hobby lobby :( someone explain please!?
FemmeThoughts,29p9xu,Black_Orchid13,3,Thu Jul 3 11:00:47 2014 UTC,"Kinda complicated; most of the internet has been melting down over it recently.  The short form is:  Hobby Lobby is owned by David and Barbara Green.  They're very Christian, so much so that they, eg, refuse to open on Sundays.  They also believe (or so they claim) that abortion is a sin, that this extends to things which might prevent a fertilized egg from being implanted, that this extends, in particular, to IUDs and the ""morning after pill"", and that this further extends not just to purchasing such things directly, but also purchasing insurance for their employees that covers such things.  The PPACA, meanwhile, requires companies such as Hobby Lobby to purchase insurance that covers exactly that for their employees (part of the ""contraception mandate"").  But the RFRA (passed 1993) says (paraphrasing) ""all other laws shall be read to have a very broad religious accommodation, unless they explicitly say otherwise"".  And PPACA didn't say otherwise, so the Greens sued.  It eventually hit the Supreme Court, which ruled 5 to 2 that the RFRA applies not just to individuals, but also to ""closely held"" corporations (defined as having 5 or fewer owners owning 50% or more  of the stock), and further ruled 5 to 4 that the Greens had shown a legitimate religious belief, that the government had articulated a compelling interest in providing contraception, but that they had failed to show that the contraception mandate was the least restrictive method of achieving that.  (Mostly because the government was already offering exemptions to other people.  If they'd been enforcing the mandate on everyone, Hobby Lobby would probably have lost.  Ah well.)  TL;DR:  Hobby Lobby said ""we have a religious belief that providing insurance that covers IUDs are murder!"", Congress said ""you must provide insurance that covers IUDs, 'cause unwanted pregnancy is bad!"", but they also said ""even crazy religious beliefs should be accommodated unless there's no better way"", and the Court ruled that there was a better way in this case:  If nothing else, the government could just buy every woman who wanted one an IUD using general tax money.  (Which, obviously, they won't do.  But they could.)  Episode number 87 in ""dammit, wouldn't it be nice if the PPACA had been drafted better"", an ongoing series.  Anyhow, the result is that Hobby Lobby was instrumental in getting a Supreme Court decision that said that IF you can make a showing that you have a legitimate religious belief that IUDs and the morning after pill are wrong, AND you own a closely held company, THEN you don't have to provide insurance that covers IUDs and the morning after pill.  Which is pretty lame.  The next step is probably an announcement that objecting closely held companies can opt out of providing coverage, but insurance companies have to cover it anyhow.  Except Hobby Lobby self insures, so that'll be going straight back to the court.  Wee!  Edit:  Oh, and if you think the RFRA sounds like a really stupid law, well, it really is.  Apparently back in '93 it seemed like an awesome idea though; passed the Senate 97 votes to 3, and was eagerly signed into law by Clinton, then upheld as constitutional 8 votes to 0 by the Supreme Court.  And given the gridlock in Washington, probably not going anywhere soon.  Edit 2: I am very very bad at TL;DRs.  How about ""Hobby lobby is owned by some religious dicks, who sued to gain the right not to provide insurance which covers IUDs and the morning after pill, and won."""
FemmeThoughts,29p9xu,codayus,2,Thu Jul 3 12:49:01 2014 UTC,"that this extends to things which might prevent a fertilized egg from being implanted, that this extends, in particular, to IUDs and the ""morning after pill""   It's worth noting how... silly this is, since the evidence is overwhelming that the covered morning after pills don't prevent implantation. Not even a single documented even potential case in a reputable study that I'm aware of. Not to mention the Greens have called them ""abortion pills"" (as is common among that demographic), probably even in their Supreme Court arguments. But hey, American conservative religion gets to make its own reality.   Mostly because the government was already offering exemptions to other people. If they'd been enforcing the mandate on everyone, Hobby Lobby would probably have lost. Ah well.   If they hadn't offered a sop exemption to nonprofit religious organizations, the act sadly would almost certainly never have passed in the first place."
FemmeThoughts,29p9xu,so_srs,2,Thu Jul 3 13:31:32 2014 UTC,"It's worth noting how... silly this is   It is definetly worth noting.  And it is, indeed, very silly.  Not to mention outright scientifically wrong.  On the other hand...  ...it's a (claimed) religious belief, and they're all silly.  If they had scientific backing we wouldn't call them ""religious beliefs"".  :)  (The RFRA was originally passed in response to a crackdown on the use of peyote for religious purposes among native americans.  I believe the stated religious justification for peyote use is that it lets believers talk to the dead, or possibly to their gods.  There's no scientific backing for this belief either, needless to say.  But for good or ill, we don't ask if religious beliefs are true, but if they are sincerely held.)   If they hadn't offered a sop exemption to nonprofit religious organizations, the act sadly would almost certainly never have passed in the first place.   Pretty much.  :-/  But that—and all the other compromises—are making life pretty hard now.  It's still possible, albeit very unlikely, that the entire act will be struck down due to procedural missteps during the scramble to pass the bill.  Eep."

Every individual is different, so in theory there are guys out there who possess the characteristics you're looking for.

Adults - if we use the term to describe people who are no longer in college - absolutely play sports for fun.  My brother is in his 30s and plays a game called Ultimate Frisbee, which may sound lame but involves a lot of running and agility and being in the sun.  Also look for permaculture groups, as that community draws people who are open-minded, feminist, left-leaning, passionate about greater issues, and who care about their bodies, eat healthy, and exercise.  Again, if you're on Facebook, all of these groups will likely have a page. If you aren't on Facebook, you could try to organize your own meetup on your local subreddit."

FemmeThoughts,29m06x,katinahat,3,Wed Jul 2 02:48:41 2014 UTC,"This might not be what you're looking for, but I met my husband on campus.  As a university student I found it really easy to decide who I would date and who I wouldn't because I was constantly hearing the opinions of people around me, in and out of class. So when a good looking dude established feminist cred with a hunky account of The a Second Sex,my girlfriends would talk about it. We would gossip over which guys called out who guys for slut shaming, which ones actually read Butler and agreed with a performative theory of gender, which ones disagreed with profs making sexist remarks (which was like, bonus level feminism, and we had super sexist profs so there was a constant array of opportunities).  I was super lucky to be in an explicitly feminist space where virtually every guy there was at least functionally literate in the subject and at least identified as feminist. Don't get me wrong, they often denied their privilege or argued that because they were feminists they could do no wrong (lol) but in general a waaaay more attractive lot of guys then, say, some of the STEM faculties.  So maybe scope out feminist oriented groups?"
FemmeThoughts,29m06x,julialex,5,Wed Jul 2 07:55:42 2014 UTC,"Daww congrats on getting married :)  some reason, when I was in university, the men I knew were not feminist oriented.  I should try to find examples of feminist oriented groups - do you know of any examples?"
FemmeThoughts,29m06x,julialex,3,Wed Jul 2 15:44:23 2014 UTC,"Thanks! :) we're a pretty atypical couple but I like it that way.  I think it depends totally on where you are, but a good start might be any Gender studies or Women's studies groups, LGBT groups (bisexual men often know what is up with the patriarchy AND date women sometimes so not a bad place to pick up dudes to be crude), and any women's shelter/group/snot-for-profit might have straight men also participating/volunteering/working so volunteering and attending rallies and stuff is a great way to meet like minded people and find out about other groups and associations. In all likelihood just making a few friends at places like these you may end up connecting with a group that is feminist friendly and has some eligible bachelors.  If you're totally in doubt, try attending some public lectures held by your local university or college's women's or gender studies faculty, and if you're in a small town with a small college that doesn't have one, sociology might be a good bet too (though beware the sociologists that treat women as specimens, there are a few).  I should say too that men at these events are not guaranteed to be cool. There are unfortunately some people who will pretend to believe in certain things when in reality they are more shady - pretty much all social action or volunteer groups get the odd creeper, so places like these definitely increase your chances of meeting feminist guys, but some feminist guys are still pricks. :)  Edit. Silly mobile"

FemmeThoughts,29kx08,Big_Suze,13,Tue Jul 1 17:56:41 2014 UTC,"Disclaimer: I post a lot in AMR and I find the Men's Rights ""Movement"" on the whole to be a repugnant haven for misogynists, homophobes and transphobes, and often racists as well.  That said. This article did a good job of presenting MRAs fairly and with compassion. I appreciate that a lot, because I know my anger and frustration with many MRAs I see and read about online clouds my ability to view them as people with histories and pain just like anyone else. They say and believe horrible things, but many are men in pain who have completely misdirected their anger and bitterness--but they do need help, just not the kind the MRM offers, which is basically just blaming women for everything bad.  This was a good, unbiased article, but I still think it's important to realize that in its current (and honestly, historic) manifestation, the MRM is little more than an anti-feminist, anti-women group. The article quotes some speakers who claimed that most women reporting rape do so out of regret. Another who said evil assholes exist solely as a result of women choosing to procreate with assholes, so it's women's fault when there are bad men doing bad things. Another had a slide-show that had photos of underage Miley Cyrus saying something about men being ""rapey."" Audience members laughed when rape was discussed. The organizer of the conference, Paul Elam, has written articles saying women are begging to be raped and as touched upon in this piece, advocated a ""Bash a Violent Bitch"" Month. He said his rhetoric has gotten less extreme, he's used the excuse of satire (he does not know what satire means, in that case). But within that piece, he even said men shouldn't actually bash a woman because they'd have to deal with the courts and anger management classes afterwards. Not because it's wrong to violently assault someone. Sound like a human rights movement?  My overall point is: men have issues that need addressing. I personally think feminism is equipped to handle that, but I respect that others may not feel similarly or feel comfortable identifying with feminism for whatever reason. However the MRM is not a movement that actually tries to help men. They spend more money lining Paul Elam's pockets than they do donating to actual groups that help boys and men. Groups which, I may add, often explicitly distance themselves from MRAs because of the terrible connotation."
FemmeThoughts,29kx08,SpermJackalope,7,Tue Jul 1 18:34:51 2014 UTC,"I agree.  The article leaves a lot unsaid about the larger MRM and only touched on some of Elam's history of violent and offensive rhetoric.  When confronted about it, he laughed it off and said he has mellowed out over the years."
FemmeThoughts,29kx08,SpermJackalope,4,Tue Jul 1 19:10:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah I mean I do think the author was a little too forgiving, but I've also seen the very worst that has come out of the MRM and I can understand why she wrote the piece the way she did. Although I do not think there is any good reason to give Elam a pass about his despicable behavior and words.  Another journalist from Time was at the conference, and she was very upset by what was said in some of the speeches given. Elam went off the rails about her tweeting some of the vile bits of the conference. Funny that a man who wrote a less-than-sympathetic article about the conference didn't receive the same treatment..."

All of the guys thought she was so into it but they were too full of themselves to realize how insulting they were towards her and her culture and how much they were upsetting her. It was like the guy whose family was hosting her brought her over to show his new Asian play toy."

FemmeThoughts,29i4ut,gypsyfire,20,Mon Jun 30 20:35:26 2014 UTC,"This was the most disturbing part of this article for me:     A report published in a recent issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology revealed that the pay and influence of test groups of women in the US and Germany consistently rose as their weight dropped below the healthy average. By contrast, weight gain was an indicator of financial success for males up to the point of extreme obesity, when men too begin to pay a professional penalty.  Causality is always difficult to establish. Even with a study as rigorous as this, it is impossible to say conclusively whether the women lost weight because their salaries rose, or whether their salaries rose because they lost weight.    How terrifying. I don't necessarily agree with all of her conclusions, but this facet in particular struck home."
FemmeThoughts,29i4ut,lavenderblue,18,Mon Jun 30 22:19:35 2014 UTC,"this part kinda hit me: ""Of all the female sins, hunger is the least forgivable; hunger for anything, for food, sex, power, education, even love. If we have desires, we are expected to conceal them, to control them, to keep ourselves in check. We are supposed to be objects of desire, not desiring beings. We do not need food: in many ways, we are food, trainable meat, lambs queueing up to buy mint sauce. We consume only what we are told to, from lipstick to life insurance, and only what will make us more consumable ourselves, the better to be chewed up and swallowed by a machine that wants our work, our money, our sexuality broken down into bite-sized chunks.""  I think part of this is capitalism.  We live in a capitalist society and everyone, but particularly women, are always trying to do things to make themselves more consumable.  Better employees,  more fuckable.  More attractive.  more likable.  It dehumanizes people and reduces them to objects on the market.    Kinda makes you think: does all of this mean that just 'being', and nothing more (like Buddhism prescribes) is an act of rebellion and a political statement? I don't want to be an object on the market anymore.  It is killing my self esteem and happiness.  Stop being consumable above all else.  Stop being so easily defined."
FemmeThoughts,29i4ut,cranberryblue,5,Mon Jun 30 23:09:34 2014 UTC,"Yes that stood out to me too, so I went to look at the original study. A little more info from the study, if you're interested:   'From a cultivation theory perspective, very thin women are idealized and more socially valued compared with their normalweight and obese peers. Consistent with this prediction, empirical research shows that very thin women are considered more attractive, better mate choices, and more positive people compared with those of average weight (e.g., Wade & DiMaria, 2003). In fact, women who fail to live up to society’s unrealistic weight expectations are often viewed as “rebels” who do not support the classic American Protestant values of self-discipline, thrift, and hard work (Crandall, 1994).'  'A very different set of social standards exists regarding men’s weight. The media’s ideal male body is chunky and muscular (Hargreaves & Tiggemann, 2004), characterized by wide shoulders and well-developed chest and arms (Pope, Phillips, & Olivardia, 2000). Like the Barbie doll (which symbolizes an unrealistic female body ideal), today’s G. I. Joe figure is just as unattainable, with a bicep almost as big as the waist and bigger than that of the greatest body-builders of all time (Olivardia, 2002). Consistent with cultivation theory, the media images of this male ideal are internalized by many. Compared with average weight men, underweight men are more dissatisfied with their build, feel less handsome with less sex appeal, and feel lonelier (Cohane & Pope, 2001).  Although being skinny is not an ideal for most men, it also clearly is not a social ideal for men to become obese in Western society (e.g., Hebl & Turchin, 2005). As noted by Mishkind, Rodin, Silberstein, and Striegel-Moore (1986), mesomorphic male physiques (i.e., of well-proportioned build) are considered more attractive than ectomorphic (thin) or endomorphic (obese) physiques. Studies have demonstrated that people assign positive personality traits to drawings or photographs of mesomorphic men and mostly negative traits to nonmesomorphic men. For example, Kirkpatrick and Sanders (1978, pp. 91–92) showed that the traits ascribed to mesomorphic men were very positive (i.e., best friend, has lots of friends, polite, happy, helps others, brave, healthy, smart, and neat). By contrast, endormorphic men were characterized by one set of negative traits (i.e., sloppy, dirty, worries, lies, tired, stupid, lonely, and lazy), whereas ectomorphic men were described with a different set of negative traits (i.e., nervous, sneaky, afraid, sad, weak, and sick).'   The article contains 2 studies, the first based in Germany that only measured the participants weight at two different times. The second study was based in America and measured the participants weight 25 times to allow comparrisons between the same person at different times/weights. They controled for height, marital status, the presence of schoold aged children, health, hours worked, type of industry, level of training, educational attainment and self esteem.  here are the figures showing variation in salaries for the two studies."

I have to say though, this is clearly a white middle class, London phenomenon. This is focusing on the best London has to offer when it comes to education, talented, likeable young feminist and educated men going out into inner city schools to be cool and hip and clever.   However.   Britain has a conservative government. The education secretary is not a feminist. In fact, he's extremely reactionary and pushed through a load of backwards ""reforms"" because he's gunning for a job as PM. He's a bastard, and outside London he controls schools and their curriculums with an iron fist. It's quite scary because he's breeding a generation of young machoistic nationalists.

If he keeps threatening you, call the damn cops! By letting this go on, you are also enabling him. There are no consequences for his actions, he rules the home.  Try to get a job closer to your school. Save everything you can. Tell your parents that you don't accept they way you are being treated and shouldn't have to. They can't stop you from moving out.  As for break downs... You need a support system there. A lot of schools offer counseling options for their students, you should look in to that.  Don't be your parents.

Your brother sounds like a street thug, have you brought this up in detail to your parents? Also, are you parents sexist at all? I personally am a stubborn hot-headed person and would have chewed him a new one and probably would go flying out the window (don't do that, okay?). My best advice is to stay diplomatic, you are better than that stupid petty crap. If you haven't sat down your parents and had a in depth conversation about where your brother is headed in life, I advise to now. It is rough out there, but you can achieve success. That is a sack of bullshit that they pinned blame on you and it's the last thing you need. If all else fails, you need to move out, the sooner the better. The best thing you can do is get roommates to help with the cost, it might help you with the stress to be around some nicer people (you can interview people by meet ups at a local public area, place an ad.)

FemmeThoughts,29gb1p,FlewPlaysGames,13,Mon Jun 30 06:58:01 2014 UTC,"You shouldn't have to live in an environment where you're constantly walking on eggshells. That kind of stress will just distract you from your studies and job anyway, so the benefits of living at home will eventually be outweighed.  What does your brother do? Is he going to school? Does he work? He sounds like a very angry young man. Are you close enough to ask him about it? Try to pick a moment when things are calm, and ask him how he feels. Is he mad at you for moving back in? Is he stressed about school? Is he having problems with friends / dating? It's absolutely not acceptable that he should take his anger out on you, but perhaps you can persuade him that you're willing to listen if he wants to talk, therefore he should see you as someone who'll lend a friendly ear, rather than someone to act as his punching bag.  If all communication has broken down, then I agree you need to find a way to move out asap. Talk to your school about financial help. If they're aware there's problems at home, they might be able to help. Stay away from your brother if possible. If he seems like losing his temper, please don't grab his clothing or anything. Just get behind a door and barricade yourself in. I'm absolutely NOT saying that it's ok to feel intimidated in your home and that you should make all the compromise by avoiding him, I'm just saying that in the short term you need to do what you can to stop things escalating, and the long term solution is to find a home where you feel safe.  Your parents are babying him. Maybe they're hoping he'll grow out of this when he's an adult, but the chances are they're setting him up for a lifetime of not understanding why no-one likes him because he's such an arsehole. Your parents might think they're protecting him, but they're actually letting him down. When he gets out into the world, there'll be no-one to cover for him - his behaviour will destroy relationships and cost him jobs. He needs to learn to control himself now or face a lifetime of ostracism.   I agree with the poster who says consider calling the police. If you're afraid things are escalating, contact the police - you don't need to call the emergency line. Perhaps go down to the station and find an officer who'll listen. From your description of your brother, it sounds like it might just make him angrier, but perhaps it'll bring your parents to their senses."

Certainly you have a right to feel safe. It isn't your fault that he is doing this. I would urge you to think about yourself first. It isn't your job to educate him or make him grow up.   It sounds like you've taken the steps to inform your parents what you desire. It sounds like they agree that he is being grossly inappropriate.   I'm so sorry. You don't deserve any of this. Do you have any place you can go? Do you have any friends you can speak with? I'd perhaps urge you to find places you can spend the night at for short periods of time. I used to go to Perkins. It was 5 blocks away and they had a pay phone.   Have you told your parents that you are scared of your brother? I understand that you've said that what he does is not okay.

FemmeThoughts,29gb1p,chakrablocker,6,Mon Jun 30 21:51:12 2014 UTC,"I'd call the police the next time he escalates, or even touches you in a threatening manner, because your parents unfortunately don't have the guts to take control. He needs consequences, since your parents aren't giving them out. And if your parents ever object about the police having to come by, tell them (please don't take this as an affront to your parents, they seem like nice people) to shove it. You, as a person and an adult, are allowed to feel secure and safe in your own home, and are allowed to call the police if your safety is breached in any way. I hope your situation turns for the better. Good luck."

I think CBT can be used to help us be more forgiving of ourselves.  Do you know what you wanted from him? If you wanted physical comfort and got physical comfort, then there's nothing wrong with that. If you wanted someone to care for you, and you knew he didn't really care, then the worst anyone can accuse you of is being naive in hoping that he would change his ways.  It's wrong of him to say, ""you have no right to be upset"" - he was a friend to you, and just because he wasn't your boyfriend doesn't mean you don't have a right to be upset. Even if a complete stranger did something cruel to me, I'd still have a right to be upset even though they're not in a relationship with me.   If he knew the FWB thing was hurting you, but kept initiating it over again with you anyway that he truly is a dickhead. He chose you because he knew you were weak after you father's death, and he sounds too insecure to try dating a woman who is confident and strong.  I recommend reading other posts from people who've been in similar situations. Read r/relationships or try other forums. Ask yourself how you'd judge the people who've been taken advantage of, the people who've been cheated on or even abused. I bet you would never judge them as harshly as you judge yourself.

I really wanted someone to care for me. I wanted someone to remedy the insecurity I felt after dad died. I'm sure this guy cared for me to a degree, but not enough, as his actions showed. I wanted more than he could give, not just romantically but platonically, and I didn't want to accept that it wasn't forthcoming because I'd have felt lost. It was also complicated by me being too depressed to date strangers at the time and feeling like I had no alternative places to seek comfort.  He certainly did take advantage of my vulnerable state. He chose me because I was available and willing to put out, despite him knowing it would ultimately hurt me :-( Gosh I do feel used. I would never have stood for this if I hadn't been depressed. Also that he just can't distinguish cuddles from an invitation to fuck was a major problem... led to him blaming me for initiating sex when I didn't. I sought one kind of comfort and ended up with a different kind that I really didn't need. He is so desperate to get laid that he would knowingly hurt a friend to do it. And sex is so primarily important to him that he would abandon a friend when it stopped. It's mad to suddenly see how his attitude massively exacerbated my problems. I never realised that before.  At least I know he in many ways suffered the consequences of his own actions - he lost a girlfriend, he lost a friend in me, and he had to deal with lots of upset women. If only he'd acknowledged his role in creating those situations he might have even learned something from the experience!   Thanks for the advice to consider how I'd judge someone else in this situation. I would be truly, truly sorry for them that they'd found themselves in such a position, and I would understand how difficult and terrifying it would be to leave someone in those circumstances, as well as how blinding depression can be to what's best for you. You've helped me sympathise with my former self instead of chastising her."
FemmeThoughts,29fpac,salineDerringer,5,Mon Jun 30 14:46:21 2014 UTC,"This was helpful to me. I had a similar situation, my FWB wasn't truly interested in me but used me for sex and comfort. But I kept coming back even though I wanted more out of the relationship. He tried to make it work with an actual relationship, but he admitted multiple times that he didn't love me. It's still fresh (we broke up a week ago), so I don't understand why I didn't leave him. Why did he have to be the one to break it off?  For you, it makes perfect sense why you put up with this guy after losing your dad and falling into depression. Under those circumstances, I too would seek comfort instead of a serious relationship. I wouldn't be able to function in a real relationship, or give my partner ""my all"". I hope you can forgive yourself, from the outside what you did seems like such a normal, human thing to do. And it sounds like you've learned more about yourself in the process."
FemmeThoughts,29fpac,Faydre,3,Mon Jun 30 03:05:39 2014 UTC,"But I kept coming back even though I wanted more out of the relationship.   More like ""I kept coming back because I wanted more""  I found that for a long time I pursued that possibility that there might be more; and when I eventually was forced to accept that there couldn't be, I just took what was on offer instead of taking nothing. The rationale is complete understandable. The missing link is failing to see the harm being done to you by remaining - I didn't see it at the time and I seriously doubt you did, it's insidious and it's masked by the apparent benefits of seeing the person you care for. I don't think I can blame myself any more for not seeing it at the time. I hope you can gain some perspective on your recent split too, and see that you are better off out of it and able to look for the love you need instead."

This part also really hit home - it's exactly what happened to me when I was raped. The guy deliberately encouraged me to get so drunk and stoned I passed out, then helped me to bed and raped me.   They use force sometimes, but mostly they use intoxicants. They don’t accidentally end up in a room with a woman too drunk or high to consent or resist; they plan on getting there and that’s where they end up.   I told my male friends about it, they collectively demanded his address because they wanted to sort him out. I didn't want that to happen so I didn't give it to them but knowing I had their support was invaluable.   There are men out there who refuse to tolerate this kind of behaviour, but I'm so disappointed there are men out there who blatantly support it in their friends even when their own girlfriends are the victims.   I'm afraid I have to agree with the article here that those girlfriends need to ditch their men and find better ones. A boyfriend tolerating me being molested by his friend would be absolute grounds for ending the relationship for me."
FemmeThoughts,29arjc,katrionatronica,30,Sat Jun 28 11:29:36 2014 UTC,"This post is fantastic, I've seen it many times before and always upvote it. Also worth noting: a really interesting story in the comments by elodieunderglass. It's a great story for explaining why these things are different for women, to guys who are well-meaning but simply don't get it.   Copy-pasted here because I don't know how to link to that specific comment:    Not surprisingly, I have a story? It’s pretty long, and I’m sorry. My husband, Doctor Glass, recently went on a weeklong workshop. The participants worked on teams, slept in a dormitory, shared meals and spent all day together. While there, Dr Glass acquired a strikingly beautiful female friend, who was absolutely luminous – like a fallen star or a revolutionary. She was also just about to enter university, making her very much younger than Dr Glass. They were on the same team, had much in common, and seemed to enjoy each other.  However, there was a twenty-something dude on the course who, according to Dr Glass, “made things awkward.” Immediately, he tried to make the workshop all about his pantsfeelings for Luminous Girl. Although he was on a different team, he was constantly buzzing around Dr Glass and Luminous Girl, getting in their way (which was dangerous and distracting, as they were doing physical labor) and trying to get her to talk to him, work with him, come over and look at his work, etc. In return she tried to ignore him, laughed him off politely, repeatedly referenced her desire to do her work, physically moved away whenever he got close to her, and stuck like glue to Dr Glass; saying NO in all those thousand little pleasant ways that women are trained to do. Awkward Dude tried to impress her with physical activity, but Dr Glass cut him off because he was being distracting. Confused and annoyed, Awkward stepped up his Game, trying to impress her with his intellectual cred, and it went down like a lead zeppelin, with Luminous and Dr Glass resuming their own work and conversations. So Awkward started loudly asking wasn’t Dr Glass married?!  At this, Awkward Dude attempted to kill Dr Glass with his laser-eyeballs at every turn, lurking and glaring and pining like a bad Snape impersonator. (Dr Glass wasn’t sure why he was suddenly the target of the resulting animosity, as he clearly had no romantic interest in Luminous, until I explained it to him: Dude had decided that the reason Luminous Girl was not sleeping with him was because she was the Possession of Another Male, and further, a Male who Already Had His Fair Share of Females; thus Dr Glass was the enemy for not shunning her and leaving a clear path for fellow males. “Oh,” said Dr Glass in sudden revelation, “That makes sense, I guess.”)  But the guy persisted – it wasn’t that Luminous didn’t like him! It was that she was clearly in thrall of my husband. The solution was to get her alone! So whenever they sat down to a lecture, Luminous, practically dragging Dr Glass by the arm, would move like lightning to position herself between him and a safe wall – with her lovely admirer circling them and glaring, loudly asking Dr Glass about his Wife Back Home. Awkward Dude implied that Dr Glass was creepy and odd for always hanging out with a girl half his age. Awkward Dude was annoyed that the course director, an older woman who should presumably know better, had assigned dorm space based on teams, so that Dr Glass and Luminous bunked in adjacent rooms (while he, Awkward Dude, was in the wing with the married couples!) because it was inappropriate and wrong to place a married man next to a teenaged female. On a particularly cold day, Dr Glass noticed that Luminous did not have warm clothing, and lent her an extra hoodie. It happened to have his name on it; Awkward Dude practically ignited, to the point where even the other people on the course were laughing awkwardly at him and saying “Uh, she’s… allowed to wear clothes?”  Luminous and Dr Glass both liked hiking, so one evening after dinner, they went out for a hike by themselves – not inviting the others in case Awkward Dude got wind of their plans. (“I mean, it sounds cruel, but I just hated him,” Dr Glass said.) It was after curfew when they walked back to their rooms,and the halls were completely dark; Dr Glass hung back to fill his water bottle. When he got to the rooms, at the end of the corridor, Luminous had been cornered by Awkward Dude. When Awkward spotted Dr Glass, he yelled at him about how inappropriate it was to go hiking alone with Luminous. Luminous seized the opportunity to flee to her room, locking the door. “I think it’s inappropriate to police her hiking,” Dr Glass said mildly and went to bed.  The next day was the last day of the course, and Dr Glass had had enough. Awkward Dude was “trying it on” in front of the whole group, making everyone uncomfortable. He had dragged Luminous into yet another unwanted conversation and Dr Glass called him out, in front of everybody, a deadly blow to Awkward’s pride. Awkward Dude tried to appeal to the group – he was only trying to be friendly – but Dr Glass had him up against the ropes, metaphorically, he’d broken the floodgates, and everyone began to laugh at Awkward instead: the old married couples, the other young men, and Luminous.  “I really feel bad about that, actually,” Dr Glass said. He hadn’t really wanted to humiliate the younger man in front of everybody, especially since his only crime had been really inept flirting. Was it really Dr Glass’s place to speak for Luminous? Perhaps he’d made a big deal out of nothing. But Dr Glass didn’t regret it. He just felt odd. He didn’t know why he’d been so savage over something so banal as Awkward’s favorite movie. He was pretty sure that he didn’t regard Luminous as a possession, or something to be protected. He’d just snapped.  “OH MY GOD,” I replied, “WHY DIDN’T YOU DO MORE? WHAT A FUCKING CREEPER!”  Well, Dr Glass wanted to assume good intentions on everyone’s part. They’d all lived together, after all, eaten together, worked together. Emotions had run high. It would have been pretty terrible for the Dude if he’d been ostracized right at the beginning, just because he wasn’t very good at talking to girls. After all, he was there for the workshop. They all were.  “AAAAH,” I wound down, “But what Luminous? WHOSE WORKSHOP WAS RUINED BECAUSE SHE DIDN’T FEEL SAFE?! She couldn’t just relax and enjoy spending time with you/her other new friends/nature – she practically had to have a bathroom buddy! He didn’t even let her focus on the work she was PAYING MONEY to do! You did not cross a line! HE CROSSED THE FUCKING LINE!”  Dr Glass totally agreed. But he still felt oddly uncomfortable about it all, as if there was something there to regret, like he was missing a piece of the puzzle. And then I asked The Question. And after I asked The Question, his face changed. He looked sick. “I didn’t think of that.” After The Question, he wished he’d been more explicit – gone to the course director. Been there more for Luminous. The good intentions that he wanted to assume, the passes he was willing to give the other man, evaporated, completely. They had evaporated for me, halfway through the story.  When I tell this story to women, they spot The Question right away. The men don’t; they think that Dr Glass behaved like a gentleman, neither doing too much nor too little. They are feminist men, and good people. They have read “The Gift of Fear” and they talk about privilege and the patriarchy, and they don’t spot it.  The Question is this: Why Was Awkward Dude Waiting For Her In The Dark?  Earlier in the story we heard that his own room was far away from hers. It was dark, at the end of a dark hall. He was waiting there, after midnight, with the lights off. HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HER IN THE DARK AT THE END OF A DARK HALL AFTER CURFEW, HE KNEW SHE HAD GONE OUT AND HE WAS WAITING FOR HER TO COME BACK. He was angry when he realized that she wasn’t alone. And Luminous was afraid – bolting into her room. Locking the door. And the women go HOLY FUCK WHAT IS THAT as soon as they hear about the atmosphere, and the men just accept it as another anecdote of Awkward Dude’s awkwardness, you know? Because how rude/silly/inept to pester a woman about hiking with another man! While the women are going BAD INTENTIONS BAD INTENTIONS FUCK SHIT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE ENDED WELL. And then you point out The Question to the men, and wait a while, and they suddenly go OH. OH MY GOD. WHY WAS HE WAITING FOR HER IN THE DARK. THAT’S – THAT’S PRETTY FUCKING SKETCHY. Everything changes. Dude-sympathy is gone. They put on the Matrix-goggles and peer into the world that apparently only women see. Awkward cornered Luminous in the dark after curfew at the end of the hall when he thought she was alone and he had a lot of anger and when my husband showed up he read Luminous as afraid and she ran into her room and locked the door. That is the reality. The good intentions, they are not there. Perhaps Awkward would have said that they were, that we, in our paranoia, are seeing rape in every dark corner. Perhaps he was trying to apologize for his previous behavior, or lend her a book, or make sure that she got back safely from her hike… so he’d chosen to do so alone, in the dark, making her afraid. That was what had been bothering Dr Glass. He wasn’t wearing the Goggles of Feminine Intuition, but he picked up on the signals that something wasn’t right. Seeing the Question doesn’t make you paranoid – it means your instincts are working.  If you live in the world of women, it isn’t your duty to educate everybody, to hand-hold and explain, to pass out Matrix-goggles. It’s Situation Normal: All Fucked Up. But perhaps you, Letter Writers, have good men, men who just need to wear the goggles.  That’s not really what I think, but our society is fucked up. I’ll assume good intentions on their part. Maybe it will help."

FemmeThoughts,29arjc,gamerscorewhore,9,Sat Jun 28 19:24:27 2014 UTC,"Hey y'all. I thought I'd chime in because this happened to me earlier this year, and this article and talking to lovely ladies on Reddit really helped. My geeky friend group also had a creeper- hugely overweight, no luck with the ladies. Wicked sharp wit and always seemingly happy, always had the latest board game. The one problem with Creeper was that he had these same exact symptoms- making sexual jokes, and NEVER respecting the boundaries of any women in the group. As evenings and weekends wore on, he would progress from demanding hugs and sitting near girls to outright groping them, myself included. Eventually I sat him down and explained that even though I was sometimes terrible at placing my own boundaries and enforcing them in the moment, he needed to respect me etc etc. I outlined exactly what would be appropriate and what would not. The next day he asked if we could talk about it again- why, I was delighted, of course! Then he dropped the bomb: ""I don't know what got you so upset. If I wanted to rape any of you I could.""   Ohhhhhh no. No no no. That's when I started talking about it, loudly, to our male friends. They mostly hadn't noticed. Creeper always tried things when other males were not in the room. My friends agreed they would stamp it out when they saw it, etc. The next visit came around months later and everything was fine to start with. Then my boyfriend announced dinner and we started a conga line of foody excitedness to noms, and Creeper was behind me. Everything was fine and I thought he had actually listened and was changing his behavior. Nope. He reached up and cupped both of my boobs from behind.  As a result, I kicked him out of my house and out of my life. He's not allowed to come to any place I am staying, or attend any gathering I am attending. I messaged or talked with everyone in the group to tell them why, and everyone was fine with it.   I think sometimes women are trained not to ""rock the boat"" too much, no matter how uncomfortable or scared they are. I put up with this guy and his stupid shenanigans for 3 years, and I was sexually assaulted previously! You'd think you'd know better, but it took me awhile to get to the point of ""you know what, fuck you. Get out of my life."" I've had to do that with a few male friends for various reasons, but I've never been happier. :)   I think these kinds of situations come up even more often in the video game/board/roleplaying game geeky nerdy circles than in other places, but maybe that's just my experience."

FemmeThoughts,29arjc,itchyivy,9,Sat Jun 28 17:20:36 2014 UTC,"I've always been puzzled by the apparent acceptance that men seem to have of predatory advances.  Maybe this is the female equivalent of the inability to see and understand ""creepyness"" that many men appear to suffer from.  This article that I found linked in another reddit comment some time ago opened my eyes. It explains and articulates something that I knew deep down but didn't fully comprehend.  What society says: Attaining sex from as many women as possible is a status symbol for men. This is what drives some men to become predators. They want to enhance their status. I always wondered why, if they wanted to get laid so badly, didn't ""sex-starved"" guys just go to a prostitute. It's because you haven't ""earned"" that sex. It wasn't a conquest. This impression that their status depends on the willingness of women to give them sex also explains the concept of being ""owed"" sex.   It makes sense, from the twisted perspective instilled by culture. And the aforementioned article made me see this with more clarity than ever.  It's a long, but a good read, highly suggested!"
FemmeThoughts,29arjc,LatrodectusVariolus,6,Sat Jun 28 19:49:08 2014 UTC,"Thank you for this. Thank you! I gives me more ways to explain and deal with these situations. I was on a school trip to Denmark for a week, and every woman (myself included) dealt with extreme creepiness from two men in the group. I remember bringing it up to the ladies partly because I was curious if it was in my head or if they all experienced it (plus I felt I needed to warn everyone). They did. But the other men in the group seemed unfazed, and challenged me (Did anything happen to YOU? They're not that bad, etc).  I remember feeling so deflated. There are two guys here making the majority of the group (teacher/chaperon included!!) extremely uncomfortable and you don't seem to care? I lost my faith in men that day. I really did, I'm still trying to get it back."

Don’t make me the bitch, make me someone who brought up legitimate concerns with a friend and then who got blown off. I didn’t do this to him – he CHOSE to act like a dick and then whine about it.   So much this. My ex would make the the villain in every story. He'd throw me right under the fucking bus. It's so, so important to have someone that will have your back."

FemmeThoughts,29arjc,ScrubTutor,-20,Sun Jun 29 04:04:20 2014 UTC,Is it up to the males in the group to do something about these people?
FemmeThoughts,29arjc,SunMoonTruth,33,Sat Jun 28 08:15:00 2014 UTC,"Yes.  From the article:   I’m directing this to men who inhabit het-identified social spaces, and I’m not really limiting it more than that. Women are already doing what they can to prevent rape; brokering a peace with the fear is part of their lives that we can never fully understand. We’re the ones who are not doing our jobs.  Here’s what we need to do. We need to spot the rapists, and we need to shut down the social structures that give them a license to operate. They are in the population, among us. They have an average of six victims, women that they know, and therefore likely some women you know. They use force sometimes, but mostly they use intoxicants. They don’t accidentally end up in a room with a woman too drunk or high to consent or resist; they plan on getting there and that’s where they end up.  Listen. The women you know will tell you when the men they thought they could trust assaulted them; if and only if they know you won’t stonewall, deny, blame or judge. Let them tell you that they got drunk, and woke up with your buddy on top of them. Listen. Don’t defend that guy. That guy is more likely than not a recidivist. He has probably done it before. He will probably do it again.  Change the culture. To rape again and again, these men need silence. They need to know that the right combination of factors — alcohol and sex shame, mostly — will keep their victims quiet. Otherwise, they would be identified earlier and have a harder time finding victims. The women in your life need to be able to talk frankly about sexual assault. They need to be able to tell you, and they need to know that they can tell you, and not be stonewalled, denied, blamed or judged.  Listen. The men in your lives will tell you what they do. As long as the R word doesn’t get attached, rapists do self-report. The guy who says he sees a woman too drunk to know where she is as an opportunity is not joking. He’s telling you how he sees it. The guy who says, “bros before hos”, is asking you to make a pact.  The Pact. The social structure that allows the predators to hide in plain sight, to sit at the bar at the same table with everyone, take a target home, rape her, and stay in the same social circle because she can’t or won’t tell anyone, or because nobody does anything if she does. The pact to make excuses, to look for mitigation, to patch things over — to believe that what happens to our friends — what our friends do to our friends — is not (using Whoopi Goldberg’s pathetic apologetics) “rape-rape”.  Change the culture. We are not going to pull six or ten or twelve million men out of the U.S. population over any short period, so if we are going to put a dent in the prevalence of rape, we need to change the environment that the rapist operates in. Choose not to be part of a rape-supportive environment. Rape jokes are not jokes. Woman-hating jokes are not jokes. These guys are telling you what they think. When you laugh along to get their approval, you give them yours. You tell them that the social license to operate is in force; that you’ll go along with the pact to turn your eyes away from the evidence; to make excuses for them; to assume it’s a mistake, of the first time, or a confusing situation. You’re telling them that they’re at low risk.”"
FemmeThoughts,29arjc,SunMoonTruth,-18,Sat Jun 28 09:00:10 2014 UTC,"Yes that's great as a wider goal but in the moments when all the women in a social group don't feel safe around someone, and the men in that group aren't stepping up, the women seem to put up with it. The behavior of the men who aren't stepping up and the creepy dude are all being tolerated by the women as well while they wait for the men to act. I'm just wondering why."
FemmeThoughts,29arjc,katrionatronica,-13,Sat Jun 28 09:08:00 2014 UTC,"But still socializing with them. Accepting their presence in the group. I'm not attacking, just curious why they, alone or collectively cannot enforce(?) this persons' exclusion from group events given their strong feelings towards/against the men in question."
FemmeThoughts,29arjc,Shmaesh,28,Sat Jun 28 09:12:15 2014 UTC,"How can they 'enforce' it? A woman, or women, in this situation doesn't have the power to 'enforce' someone not coming to social events. They can't ban them at the door of the local pub. They can only refuse to let them into their own house, or refuse to go to events where they're present. Hence the women end up excluding themselves instead of the creeper, precisely because they have no option to 'enforce' it."
FemmeThoughts,29arjc,DefinitelyNotFreud,25,Sat Jun 28 09:18:20 2014 UTC,"Oh man. I unilaterally banned a rapist from my old house back in the day.  Our apartment was definitely a hopping hang out where everyone wanted to be. I got so. much. shit. from all of the other men in our circle.  Even though they all knew both of the women he'd assaulted, too. Thankfully, I had enough sway over a social hotspot to actually do some unilateral good; and the other women in the group backed me up (they don't, always. They want approval, too),  Flashforward four or so years, and a good woman friend of mine who still lived in town let that fucker move in with her. She said he'd changed. She said our friends had made it up.  It's exhausting to try to stay away from these people. Even if you have an unusual amount of social sway within your group."
FemmeThoughts,29arjc,LatrodectusVariolus,25,Sat Jun 28 11:18:53 2014 UTC,"Because none of the men are wiling to stop inviting the guy, or stop hanging out with him and letting him know when and where social events are taking place? I can't just decide to change my social group. I med enough people in it to agree with the change in order for it to happen.  The women described in the article actually spoke to the person making them feel threatened. That is not an easy thing to do. Telling an aggressor to stop being aggressive is a dangerous situation to be in. But some of the women out themselves in that position. And then when they tried to ""enforce"" the exclusion, that failed because men in the group weren't willing to support them.  So why are you suggesting this is the women's fault, when both stories clearly outline the only proactive characters as women, and all the stonewalling, defensiveness, and refusal to acknowledge the significance of sexual assault and harassment was done by men.  Seriously is is the whole point of the article - how on earth can we go from those stories to ""wow those women sure were tolerant why didn't they do more?"""
FemmeThoughts,299z33,discoballer,46,Fri Jun 27 22:05:05 2014 UTC,"So a bunch of bros who get laid so infrequently that they have loads of time to think about your penis are bothering your girlfriend.  Are you sure you're in college and not high school? I'm just trying to picture this scenario happening at my university, and I can't see it ending well for your ex. Someone going around telling everyone about their ex's small penis and substandard bedroom performance would only result in her gaining a reputation for pettiness and vindictiveness and also way, way oversharing. Your roommate? Your neighbors? Wow.  I'm not saying this to slam you, I just want you to know that she, and anyone who laughs along with her, is a huge moron not worth even a moment of consideration.  You are fucking your girlfriend, not Johnny Big Dick. You are getting your girlfriend off (right?), not Johnny Big Dick. Johnny Big Dick is busy pining away for someone who is taken - how pathetic, he should get laid.  You're going to have to get over your insecurities about size at some point, bro, because that's actually what's causing most of your problems here. If you need to talk to a counselor, do it, but I feel like being able to satisfy your partner(s) would be enough."
FemmeThoughts,299z33,ScrubTutor,9,Fri Jun 27 22:38:29 2014 UTC,"Yes, this happened at a university. And my ex does have a reputation for being petty.   And it is a consolation that you think they are morons.  Yes, my girlfriend and I have great sex. Nearly every time she has an orgasm. And sometimes she cums.   I have made a lot of progress with my insecurities, just the fact that people could go up to my girlfriend when I'm not there and make fun of her for being with me BECAUSE OF THAT was so infuriating and hurtful."
FemmeThoughts,299z33,chelbski-willis,14,Fri Jun 27 23:11:55 2014 UTC,"Dude, let it roll off your back like water off a duck. Scrubtutor has it all right. Don't give them the satisfaction of getting to you with this childish bullshit. What your sex life really consists of is between the two of you, and no one else.   I don't have a penis, I can't possibly understand how emasculating this is for you, but I'm positive you can overcome it. There is more to you than inches!"
FemmeThoughts,299z33,chelbski-willis,3,Sat Jun 28 00:14:25 2014 UTC,Thank you! I appreciate the support.
FemmeThoughts,299z33,kochipoik,11,Sat Jun 28 00:20:10 2014 UTC,"No problem, man. As an add on, and a pet peeve of mine, don't ever get caught up in the circle jerks about penis size that you find on reddit sometimes. Some men are obsessed with dick size and simply cannot fathom that a woman could find worth in a man with a small penis. As you and I know, that is simply untrue. Don't let those idiots get the best of you."
FemmeThoughts,299z33,kochipoik,5,Sat Jun 28 00:24:09 2014 UTC,"I will admit, I used to secretly think like them until I met my current AMAZING girlfriend.   It isn't the fact that she prefers small. I'm open to toys in the bedroom. If she wanted something bigger every now and then, I'd be comfortable with a bigger vibrator or dildo.   She defended me less than a week into the relationship, never second guessed me, and always had my back when so many people were making fun of me and were against our relationship (because I was small?)   She is amazing and thank you for taking the time to respond to this. This subreddit is just great."
FemmeThoughts,299z33,chelbski-willis,14,Sat Jun 28 00:27:48 2014 UTC,"Ugh I agree with /u/chelbski-willis, sometimes you'll see those circle jerks where guys completely disregard people's actual opinions because they're so obsessed with size. Most women would not give a shit, especially if you're nice/not a douche/good in bed. And you sound like you know what you're doing, which is pretty good for a 21 year old.  Like others have said, I can't directly offer empathy cause I don't have one, but I can imagine how awful this is. I initially thought of suggesting that she make some flippant comment back along the lines of, ""at least /u/discoballer knows how to use it"" but I don't think that would even help. Probably just ignoring it and laughing it off would be best?"
FemmeThoughts,299z33,ScrubTutor,5,Sat Jun 28 00:52:09 2014 UTC,"Thanks for caring. I wouldn't say I'm particularly ""good"" in bed because sex takes two people. I'm great with my current girlfriend. We both communicate our sexual needs and desires, and in turn we have great sex. On the other hand, the sex with my ex was bad. But the entire fault isn't mine or because I'm small. She never saw it that way though.  What my GF did was tell them it was a lie and that we have the best sex she's ever had. She's basically just great as a person.  Despite all of that though, I couldn't help but feel like shit. I mean, I am human. But all the replies here have helped me so much.   Thank you, I mean it."
FemmeThoughts,299z33,itsacoup,5,Sat Jun 28 00:59:40 2014 UTC,"Yeah your first sentence sums it up really well. For me, to be ""good at sex"" is to understand your partner and be willing to work to give them pleasure, and it definitely is a two-way street.  I hope this thread will help if those doughe bags do it again. Fuckers. I can totally understand feeling like shit from it too - I'm overweight so that's my most obvious ""flaw"", it would be devestating if someone tried to warn someone off me because I'm fat. Not only because it's nasty and judgemental, but because that has absolutely no bearing on who I am as a person"
FemmeThoughts,299z33,itsacoup,3,Sat Jun 28 01:17:18 2014 UTC,"This thread has helped. I favorite it and will always come back to this if I have any insecurities.

FemmeThoughts,299z33,chelbski-willis,4,Sat Jun 28 00:31:08 2014 UTC,"I mean, come on, it is so hot using sex toys on a girl. It gets me going too."
FemmeThoughts,299z33,chelbski-willis,15,Sat Jun 28 00:52:44 2014 UTC,"Yes, my girlfriend and I have great sex.   You have literally zero actual problems. If your girlfriend feels like she's being harassed, she's a big girl, she can take care of it. But other than that you're fine."
FemmeThoughts,299z33,calliethedestroyer,6,Fri Jun 27 23:43:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks. I agree with you. She has handled it so well. She defended me every single time. She has what I would call a ""feminist consciousness"" and doesn't really buy into patriarchy or the idea that to be a man, you need to have a large penis."
FemmeThoughts,299z33,itsacoup,19,Fri Jun 27 23:55:21 2014 UTC,"Hey, that sucks a lot. I think you recognize that it's a thing you feel shitty about only because of external forces, but you still feel bad. That's okay. Feelings are not rational, and you have the right to have them. You also have the right to, you know, not be harassed like this (and I, personally, feel like this is some pretty obvious and unacceptable sexual harassment towards you) but it seems like that ship has sailed.  So, your fundamental goal is: let's not feel shitty about what other people are saying. Easy to say, tough to do. The method that I've used in the past to manage these kind of negative thoughts is mental redirection. So, for example, you feel yourself start to worry about this issue. Redirect your thought process away from ""I am not this thing other people think I should be"" and towards more positive thoughts, like ""my SO appreciates me exactly how I am,"" ""wow, SO and I had a great time last night -wink-"" or even specific memories of positive encounters with your SO.   By noticing the negative thoughts and countering them/mentally leading yourself away from them, hopefully you'll slowly be able to accept on an emotional level what your brain already knows, which is the fact that there is nothing wrong with your body or your male-ness.  I hope this helps--as a woman, I've obviously never faced a situation similar to that kind of emasculation, and what it emotionally entails for you. I would also suggest, going forward, for you to think a lot about what you feel defines you as a man, that maybe aren't specific body parts. The social discourse on this subject is pretty obviously big dick/big muscles=""real"" man, and I think you also recognize how shitty that is. Internally redefining gender for yourself may also give you a boost."
FemmeThoughts,299z33,calliethedestroyer,12,Sat Jun 28 00:01:27 2014 UTC,"I've posted this issue in three subreddits. This one, r/relationships, and r/smalldickproblems.   This is the most helpful and insightful advice I've received. Thank you so much. I knew working through this from the feminist perspective would be the best approach. I just couldn't do it on my own.   You understood that I knew it was irrational but still felt shitty. Your mental redirection thought process is just what I needed.   Your advice, as a feminist woman has really helped me.   I've taken feminist philosophy courses, read many feminist authors, both male and female, and I feel like I absolutely have the tools to redefine what gender means to me (given that I don't buy into the current paradigm in the first place.)  Thank you so much. I'm saving this comment. It has meant a lot to me."
FemmeThoughts,299z33,calliethedestroyer,7,Sat Jun 28 00:08:57 2014 UTC,"I am really, really glad you were able to connect with my perspective. Nobody should ever have to feel bad about themselves over their body but what do you know, it happens anyway. Saying ""I shouldn't feel bad about this"" just makes you feel worse because you're not good enough to let it go, and then it's just this miserable spiral.  Your thoughtful approach to the issue is really what is going to help you the most going forward. I was just a little external push that helped you get through the mental muck, as it were :) It's so hard to have a sense of scale when you're looking at things inside your own head. But now that you've had your ah-ha moment, you have a great set of tools that will help you constructively improve your life and I would bet the lives of those around you, as well.  Thanks for sharing your experience. It's a bad situation but the more light we shine on moments like these, the less likely they are to happen to anyone. And it's a handy reminder that we all can suffer, but we are also all capable of helping each other out.  (And lastly--thanks for the gold!

FemmeThoughts,298u05,the253monster,6,Fri Jun 27 19:30:03 2014 UTC,"I think you're confusing my point. Just for clarification's sake, i'll elaborate: As we know, intersectionality is the study of intersections between forms of oppression.  In this case, I am suggesting OP allow those to whom she is speaking to see the ridiculousness of their assertion that something which is different is bad, by using a similar example which would not ordinarily be permitted by society. I am then suggesting she liken the ridiculousness of that race-related claim to the ridiculousness of the claim that, ""To be cool, or to be on a level playing field with men, one must act 'like a man.'""  Because of the fact that most people would never say, ""You're so cool you're like a white in a black's body,"" or anything of that ilk with regard to race, they should not make similar claims with regard to gender, as it reinforces the idea that one gender is inferior by default, just as saying the above sentence with regard to race implies that one race is cooler or better by default.  Does that logic make sense? I have used this in social situations and it has worked. And usually it does result in a good conversation about intersectionality; about how actions, words, and patterns of speech are often assigned a race and a gender so as to discourage certain of them from being expressed in certain company. We know that isn't cool, but intersectionality helps us to put a name on these systems of oppression and to discuss them.  EDIT: Bad grammar in the second paragraph"

I think saying ""You wouldn't say ___ to Black people"" is the opposite of intersectionality. People are racist to Black people. In many places it's completely acceptable to be racist to Black people and I'm sure there are many Black people who have been told exactly what you're claiming people wouldn't say. I have personally heard stuff about how certain people are ""white on the inside"".  Basically, if the way you attempt to educate people is by siphoning off energy from Black activism that is not progressive and this is something that is very very common for people to do.  Disclaimer: I am not Black and I don't know if you or the OP is Black. My experience is that most Black people are tired of these kinds of comparisons being made, though, so that's where I'm coming from."
FemmeThoughts,298u05,the253monster,3,Fri Jun 27 20:23:04 2014 UTC,"I suppose that's where we'll have to agree to disagree. One of the ideas within intersectional studies behind the ""racing"" and ""sexing"" of actions and words is that it's unacceptable on all levels, meaning that calling someone like Carlton from Fresh Prince ""not a true black person"" because some of his actions are ""white"" or ""whitebread"" is just as unacceptable as calling a girl ""not a true girl"" or, as in this case, ""a dude in a chick's body,"" as both of those attitudes reinforce the same fallacious argument: That certain things are inherently feminine, masculine, black, or white, or otherwise.  I appreciate your clarification however, and i'd be happy to discuss this further, as it's one of my favorite topics."
FemmeThoughts,298u05,naturalchild915,3,Fri Jun 27 20:29:43 2014 UTC,Part of my point here is that this guy is probably not a feminist who studies intersectionality so there's no reason to assume that he (or any other given person saying bigoted things) would not also say something bigoted about Black people. The other part of my point is that people do say racist things and it's inaccurate to imply that it's not something someone would do.
FemmeThoughts,298u05,REAL_CONSENT_MATTERS,4,Fri Jun 27 20:43:02 2014 UTC,"Definitely. I just think it's wise to act as if saying racist things is already a socially unacceptable thing to do in dealing with things like this. Social pressure is then put on the person making the inaccurate comments to adhere to the crowd in which they find themselves. In this case, a crowd (or a singular company) which doesn't tolerate racist or sexist remarks.  I've found that acting, in public, as if something racist or sexist is inherently unacceptable, usually puts pressure on the person saying it to change their ways. Sure, it's not them actually learning WHY their behavior is wrong, but it's a good first step, IMHO.  EDIT: Okay i'm not a grammar and syntax genius. ""to"" changed to ""is"" in the 3rd sentence of the first paragraph"
FemmeThoughts,298u05,naturalchild915,2,Fri Jun 27 20:48:54 2014 UTC,"Seems like there's an intersection there. The person OP is talking about is assigning a gender to her actions, and the person u/the253monster is referring to is assigning a race to someone's actions. In either case, you're putting a race or a gender on to actions which inherently don't have a race or a gender.  doesn't intersectionality mean that we shouldn't be doing any of this?"
FemmeThoughts,298u05,Me-Here-Now,3,Fri Jun 27 21:04:38 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying that either is appropriate but that the comparisons are harmful and that for a lot of people the answer to ""Would you say that to a Black person?"" is ""yes"" because many people are racist.  Also, that's... not what intersectionality is supposed to mean. People started using the word to describe the situation when people are oppressed in multiple ways: the forms of oppression ""intersect"" to create new situations and new kinds of oppression that are different from any individual form. White people going ""My experiences are like a Black person's"" is not what intersectionality supposed to mean.  I really should duck out of this conversation though because I'm getting frustrated and I feel like I've explained everything as well as I know how to.  Edit: Okay, yeah, I'm officially quitting this conversation.  I'm going to leave this for people: White People Using Blackness and Anti-Black Racism Analogies For Their Experiences Is NOT Intersectionality by Trudy from Gradient Lair."

FemmeThoughts,298u05,LivingDeadInside,18,Fri Jun 27 22:17:56 2014 UTC,"If it can not be turned around and still seem complimentary to them, then it is not a compliment, as in: ""you're so cool you are like a chick in a dude's body"".  In which case you are  the one saying that you see them like you see yourself.  Your instincts are right, what they are saying is not a compliment. If you feel like you are ""beating your head against a wall"",  maybe you need to enlarge your circle of friends."
FemmeThoughts,298u05,CaptainAirstripOne,13,Fri Jun 27 16:16:26 2014 UTC,"Wow, as a transgender woman with transmasculine friends that's so horrible,   Fuck respect people for who they are, male != better, calling women men is fucking insulting I can't even understand why'd they can't see that."
FemmeThoughts,298u05,DecoDamsel,10,Fri Jun 27 18:28:29 2014 UTC,"I've always disliked it when friends say this, too, because in my mind it translates as: ""I like you enough that I will overlook the fact that you have a vagina. Instead of treating you as a sexual object or prize to obtain, I'll give you basic human respect""."
FemmeThoughts,298u05,foreverburning,11,Sat Jun 28 01:29:36 2014 UTC,"The response to this is generally ""You can take offense to them complimenting you, but that is your problem, not theirs."" or ""They are just saying they see you like they see themselves, it's a compliment.""   It's intended as a compliment, yes, but choosing to compliment me in this way shows they have a sexist worldview, they see women as inferior. I don't want to be one of the few special women admitted into their 'Boys Only' club. I don't want there to be a Boys Only club."

FemmeThoughts,298u05,Oniknight,17,Sat Jun 28 13:10:05 2014 UTC,"Uhg. T'm just exhausted by this. My boyfriend's best friend (basically his sister, they lived together --with her boyfriend-- for something like 6 years) insists and will not leave it alone that she is ""one of the boys"", going so far as to insist she is going to his bachelor party.   You don't have to be ""more like a dude"" in order to be cool or fun to be around. But it does make me like you less when you perpetuate the idea that it's somehow better to be more ""like a man"" and less like a dramatic teen girl."
FemmeThoughts,298u05,kellynw,3,Fri Jun 27 15:42:08 2014 UTC,"Whenever one of them does or says something you approve of, attribute it to being ""like"" someone that doesn't have one of their less-socially-desirable characteristics. If the target is overweight, just say ""You're so cool... you're like a thin guy in a fat guy's body."" If he's black, then ""like a white guy in a black guy's body."" And so on. Hopefully they'll catch on soon."
FemmeThoughts,298u05,LatrodectusVariolus,2,Fri Jun 27 17:56:49 2014 UTC,"I think it depends on how the comment is meant. If he talks disparagingly about women and treats them as less than men, then that's pretty sexist.   But it may also be him pointing out (hamfistedly) that your behavior makes you fit in with a bunch of dudes without it being awkward. Some women (and some men) aren't good at this. When someone feels that you really fit into their friend group where all are male except for you, what he's really saying is that you are a close platonic friend who is not a potential romantic partner to any of them so you can truly be a good friend without any weirdness that sexual attraction inevitably brings into many mixed gender/sexuality friend groups."
FemmeThoughts,298u05,gypsywhisperer,2,Fri Jun 27 17:49:17 2014 UTC,"I agree. I have a few close lady friends and we have ""girls' night"" every Tuesday. We all have a few close guy friends who are welcome to join us whenever. I've referred to them as one of the gals without them taking offense to it. I guess it just depends on the context and the attitudes of the person making the comment."

FemmeThoughts,297klf,dragonscantfly,5,Fri Jun 27 07:14:12 2014 UTC,"Jezebel's so much better than people give credit for. Erin Gloria Ryan, Dodai Stweart, and Lindy West are brilliant women.   In feminist spaces, there's always going to be something problematic and controversial every once in a while. I'd rather get my media from somewhere diverse that forces me to think critically, instead of somewhere that doesn't slip up but doesn't touch on anything controversial. There's always a safe way out and I think that Jezebel has taken the hard route (while still fitting the Gawker MO) more and more over the past few years.  I probably read ~20 Jezebel articles a week and there's so, so much good content there. It's particularly good for baby feminists; I wasn't a feminist until I accidentally subscribed to Jez in my RSS feed and the content I saw there shook up everything I thought I believed."

FemmeThoughts,297klf,SomeOldGoat,2,Sun Jun 29 21:49:50 2014 UTC,"I love Ally Fogg--he writes about gender issues for The Guardian sometimes I think? Anyway, his blog is Heteronormative Patriarchy for Men. He distinctly doesn't self-identify as feminist but his thoughts seem to be pretty in line with feminist thinking. He also writes about issues the effect men (I think he does some activist work for DV/rape crisis centers, so at lot of his writing about men seems to be concerned with that) which I think is useful for a sense of well-roundedness.  Way on the more radical end of the spectrum, I like Feminist Current. Meghan Murphy, who runs the blog, is a self-identified radical feminist and as such can have less nuanced views about transwomen, but she also doesn't typically discuss trans issues so that's easy to avoid."
FemmeThoughts,297klf,Devilish,3,Fri Jun 27 15:55:08 2014 UTC,"less nuanced views about transwomen   Nice euphemism, but ""more bigoted"" is a lot more accurate than ""less nuanced"". It doesn't sound as nice, but hey: it shouldn't."
FemmeThoughts,297klf,SomeOldGoat,2,Fri Jun 27 17:53:40 2014 UTC,"Well, I say less nuanced because my impression from the specific individuals that write for this blog is they are not anti-trans but possibly think of trans issues as separate from feminist issues. I disagree with them, but as said trans issues come up so infrequently on that particular blog that it's easy to just take the good that comes with it and ignore the bad."
