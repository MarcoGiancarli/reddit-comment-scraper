Should get a writing sample, probably. $10 [B]  Inks:  Iroshizuku Kon-peki - %50 $10 SOLD  Iroshizuku Tsuki-yo - %70 $15 SOLD  Iroshizuku Ajisai - %90 - $20 with some ink damage from a leak in shipping SOLD  The Metro and Prera were experiments in finer nibs without breaking the bank, and the VP is out the door because I liked the flat black and fine better than gunmetal and medium, the box will state that the VP is a Fine, itâs a lie, I swapped nibs.  The Lamys have been carried for maybe a day each, no visible wear.  Didnât end up liking the style.  I was gripey in a previous post about the driness of the al-star, but once it got properly flushed, itâs perfectly well behaved.  x450 was tossed in from another exchange here, and I had some grand designs that wonât come to passâ¦so if you buy anything else, this can go along with it.  The Ahab was a trade for a spare part I had.  Iâve cleaned it up and spent a little time with the dremel.  Itâs not professional quality work, but itâs not half bad.  Itâs also only $10.  Flexes MUCH better than when I got it, and after doing a little reading I heat set the feed.  Itâs pretty well behaved, but my penmanship is likely to always suck, and instead of lying to myself that itâll get better and Iâll have fun with this penâ¦Iâm just going to let it fly free.  All have original packaging except for the Jinhao and the Ahab.  The VP has slight discoloration on the nib, need a better photo of that, probably.  Iâm happy to get anyone photos of anything in particular theyâd like.  Iâm just super good at putting things off later, and my potato quality photos above will get this whole train moving.  I also have some samples that didnât get much use, and if you buy a pen Iâll throw in a sample or three for free (depends on which pen ;)  Those are:  Noodlerâs Apache Sunset  Noodlerâs Habanero  Diamine Syrah  Diamine Ancient Copper  Diamine Denim  Pelikan Edelstein Tanzanite  Iroshizuku Shin-kai  Iroshizuku Take-sumi  Iroshizuku Kon-peki  Most have had a single ml pulled from them, but every one has enough for a fill or two."

Pen_Swap,3dw67s,vinnycordeiro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:57 2015 UTC,Looks like it
Pen_Swap,3dw67s,Striker6g,-7,Mon Jul 20 07:55:24 2015 UTC,Wow. That's the ugliest pen I've ever seen. Worse than the cap of the Platinum Desk pen.
Pen_Swap,3dw67s,brielem,4,Mon Jul 20 05:29:39 2015 UTC,"It's made for people with arthritis, who have trouble holding slimmer objects. Made to be functional, not to be pretty."

Pen_Swap,3dw4zu,typoglycemia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:18:04 2015 UTC,"Would you mind providing the length of the pen, capped, uncapped, and uncapped and posted?"
Pen_Swap,3dw4zu,Silvire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:59:21 2015 UTC,Capped: 10cm  Uncapped: 9.2 cm  Posted: 12.5 cm  Capped and posted measurements don't include the ring/it's attachment - I stopped at the cap lip.
Pen_Swap,3dwajo,dxing97,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:47:53 2015 UTC,I have a vp nib in black in broad. Ironically I have it in a rhodium vp (mismatched). I think we might be able to make something happen here.
Pen_Swap,3dwajo,rockydbull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:04:40 2015 UTC,PM sent!

Pen_Swap,3dwajo,markrobbo96,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:00 2015 UTC,The VP nibs are $61+shipping new from goulet btw. Though I know you're preferring trade.
Pen_Swap,3dv0bu,CuSetanta,2,Sun Jul 19 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"Looking to trade this handmade pen for something interesting. Its relatively heavy, with a narrow grip section, but it writes quite well.   Cost me Â£40, but I am looking for something fun in exchange. Will ship anywhere."
Pen_Swap,3dqink,NeutrinoParkerGuy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:55:32 2015 UTC,"Yes please! How about 3 pipettes, 5 big vials and 10 small ones, shipped to the Netherlands via the cheapest shipping option?  I don't know where you got these (lab you work in? Or bought at a lab supplies store?) but I've found 5-10 ml centrifuge tubes to be the perfect size for shipping small quantities of ink. In case you can get your hands on those in the future..."
Pen_Swap,3dqink,brielem,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:28:30 2015 UTC,"Sure thing, PM me with your address, I will give you my paypal, so you can send me 1 euro or something similar :)  I will have a look around the lab to find more tubes."
Pen_Swap,3dqink,ElencherMind,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:55:06 2015 UTC,Misappropriating work supplies? ;P
Pen_Swap,3dqink,markrobbo96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:24:55 2015 UTC,Maybe :) This is a one time thing as these vials are quite old.
Pen_Swap,3dqink,vermilions,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:30:09 2015 UTC,"I'm in the UK, can I take a package? Would be much appreciated, will be handy for transporting a few different inks to university without taking a ton of bottles.  My girlfriend will probably be interested too. Will be happy to throw you some cash to over postage."
Pen_Swap,3dqink,jordanjay29,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:29:25 2015 UTC,"Sure, PM me with details! Will probably send the parcel tomorrow or in two days."
