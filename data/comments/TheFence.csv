TheFence,3e0lh5,gregislegend,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:47:48 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you for the love! Really appreciate it! And for the kind words about my editing! It was definitely a bit of a challenge but I have a newfound love for sure.  As for your questions...  So our band is officially a duo. We used to be a four piece a little more than a year ago, but we had to move on from the drummer and guitarist because our visions and determination weren't lining up unfortunately. So once we split up, we knew we had to record some new tunes, and we were trying to figure out where to record. So we looked at all our favorite bands and albums, then looked at where they were recorded and who produced them. Naturally when we reached out, it was hard to get a response from anyone since they were pretty much all big-name studios, engineers, and producers. But we heard back from Mike Birnbaum and Chris Bittner who produced several of Coheed's albums. They liked our tunes and style and wanted to work with us. So we set a date and went up to record in June of 2014. We also said we needed a drummer (I'm a bass player so we had that covered, and I can play guitar as well so I did most of that as well). And Mike was like ""Well how about we call Josh and get him to play?""   ""WHAAAAATT?!""   We decided to record three songs, all of which Josh played on. He mostly played what he felt, but we would throw suggestions out depending on the vision, as would Mike and Chris. As far as getting drummers to play, we hire out musicians for live shows, so they do their best to imitate the record. But in all honesty out of like 5 different drummers that have played with us, only 1 got the parts just as they were played, and added his own flare. And this dude was the youngest out of them all. Super studious. Amazingly talented. Oh and yes, we did pay Josh for the studio work."

When you take that element away it's just like, ""Oh...Al The Killer isn't as scary as he was in my head.""  Or ""Oh... I guess it didn't take THAT much to convince Coheed to brutally murder his entire family.""  Or ""Oh. Chase and Sizer are brother and sister and one is a little girl?

We chatted for about 15 minutes - they were both so kind and genuinely appreciative that a fan had approached them. I got to give little Atlas a high five too. It was an awesome experience.  Part two to this story - I was actually on the same flight as Travis on my way to Florida. I didn't get a chance to chat with him but I said Whats up to him and that I was a huge fan of the band and he just said thanks man. I tried to catch up with him at the airport but he was about 7 rows ahead of me and you know how that goes.  I was heading from NJ to Florida for a wedding, and apparently so were the guys from the band. It was a pretty nuts experience."

It helped me knowing 3/4 of the band were sick at that time as well so that was good. I was extremely nervous but they were all really great guys, I asked about the tour and such and I almost missed my chance at getting my picture taken the camera guy had to do it 3 times I prematurely left and they all were like "" umm do you still want your picture"". That was my experience, I was sick , embarrassed myself and basically lived in awkward silence with my favourite  band."

We got pizza, played the Simpsons edition of LIFE (the board game), and chatted.  He was a cool guy, but in retrospect you could see he was kinda depressed even then, and he mentioned something about going through stuff with his ladyfriend.

I had been driving for 3 hours to see the band(North Central Indiana to Bloomington, IN), and happened to stumble into them walking out of the Taco Bell across the street from the venue. They were all cutting up, and I noticed them after hearing Josh yell ""AW YEAH MUTHAFUCKIN TACOS"" as he walked out. Me and my buddy said hey, shook their hands, and let them part to eat, but they ended up chatting with us for about 10 minutes. Claudio is very shy, very humble. Travis is outgoing, and kept giving Josh ample amounts of shit, and Josh was exactly as I expected. Very outgoing, very warm person. He really seems the type to talk to anyone.   Didn't think anything would come of it until about 4 songs in, they played Deranged, and I was front and center against the guard rail. I'm a die hard Batman fan, and was wearing a Batman t-shirt. Song played, I went fucking crazy, sang myself stupid, and Claudio shook my hand mid-set unprovoked. He just reached down, shook it, said ""Bad fuckin' ass"" and kept on.   TL;DR - Band is a class act and should be a model of most musicians on how to act."

I wasn't the biggest fan of Thursday so I walked outside to get some air and I walked out right next to Claudio. Went up to him and chatted with him a bit. Said the set was awesome etc etc. He was pretty quiet and I figured he wanted to be alone after the set.   Met Travis last year in Providence on the way to the show. My wife and I were walking down the street towards Lupo's and a guy started to walk towards us from across the street with a bag in his hands. I quickly realized it was Travis and said ""Oh shit what's up man?"" he replied, ""Am I headed in the right direction?"" in regards to the venue. I said ""it's actually in that direction"" and pointed towards the venue. I then introduced myself and he went to shake my wife's hand. She initially thought it was someone I worked with so I had to say ""This is Travis from Coheed"" and she was star struck from that point. We walked a bit with him and got a picture. We asked if we could come back stage with him but he said no. Still totally awesome."

Well he comes out around 30 minutes before the signing time and the comic con security (or maybe it was Boom! people) said that he couldn't start signing until the official start time.

Present your images and art styles from step one so the artist has an idea.  -If possible, have the artist draw up draft images of your tattoo and REVIEW REVIEW REVIEW.  I cannot emphasize this enough because tattoos are permanent and you (as well as myself) want the image to be perfect.   -Once, you're set, buckle up and get ink'd.   Some tips: Good tattoos aren't cheap. Spending a little extra goes a long way. When reviewing the artist's draft image of your tattoo, Make sure colors are bold and not spotty like an dried up marker and make sure the lines (especially for texts) are tight and not blurry.

TheFence,3dj7l2,vapevapevape,2,Thu Jul 16 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"Silent Earth has a LOT (prolly the most) of pop punk in it. It really seems like them kind of exercising it and falling more into their own sound but, on that album, you've got Three Evils, Favor House, the chorus of Cuts Marked in the March of Men, 21:13 (which has pop punkish style all throughout). It probably has less concentrated POP PUNK, than Second Stage, but it's got the most true to pop punk sounds."

Just something to think about, placement is important as it will stretch depending on how your arm is positioned. Forearm shouldn't be much of an issue, but if you go to your bicep/tricep area, you'll get some funky warping as you move your arm.

I thought the songs didn't stand out from one another, the story was hard to follow (it felt more like ""the soundtrack"" than ""the story"", y'know?), I thought it was going to a case of ""I gave it shot but it wasn't for me"".. But after checking out the other albums, I gave IKS a second shot, and I'm glad I did, because it definitely joins the likes of TA:A/D and GA1 as Coheed albums I enjoyed.

TheFence,3cyz9u,Underdog76,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:53:32 2015 UTC,"This may sound weird, but for years I only listened to the title track of this album. I simply could not understand why the band chose to follow a prog-rock masterpiece with a bunch of emo/pop-punk ""garbage."" I was hardcore into 70's prog and metal at the time (10 years ago) and wasn't exactly the most open-minded guy on the planet. Three years later I finally gave the whole album another spin, and it quickly became one of my favorite albums of all time.  The production on this album is my favorite of all the CoCa releases, which is weird because it has probably the least CoCa-sounding production of all. The drums sound super tight and the mix is very spacious, transparent and natural. After this they tried to make everything sound bigger, denser and more epic, which probably served their artistic direction, but to my ears this was and always will be Coheed's sweet spot (not knocking the other stuff, which I also love, at all!)  So, yeah, it's my favorite Coheed album. I honestly can't think of a song on here that's not at least an 8/10, and most are 10's. There must have been something in the air when they were writing and recording it; it just has something indefinable and utterly special that no other album seems to have."

The vocals are maybe a shade closer to Geddy, but lyrically, musically, the two are miles apart. Peart's lyrics are usually way more complex than this. Like the most catchy part is when Claudio breaks down into the syllabic singing bit. Then musically, the riff in this song is really poppy, the bass is nice, but not near as aggressive or influential to the whole piece like a Rush bassline would be. The drums are a bit boring in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, I like the song, I've come to love it and find myself singing it to myself a lot.

It would hard for Claudio to go back write in the middle of the story. Yes the loose ends should have already been tied up, but since their not, it''s up to interpretation.  Take Breaking Bad for example. We know the end of Walter White's story, so now we are seeing a different point of view from before those events in Better Call Saul. What ever happened in Breaking Bad is over. Vince Gilligan isn't going to go back and tell when Saul did at the of BB. It's over and done. BB has it's bookends as well.

Which is his perogative as an artist. I believe that he is better at expressing anger and sadness better than other emotions.  No matter what he does from here on out nothing is going to take away from their first records."
TheFence,3cpeyd,Raptor_Jetpack,3,Fri Jul 10 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"Just cause it doesn't follow the Amory Wars doesn't mean there isn't a concept behind the album. Also, who cares? People change I'm sure all the life changes that have been happening to them is something they've wanted to make music from for a while now."
TheFence,3cpeyd,OMGitsDSypl,3,Thu Jul 9 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"What happened? They decided to do something different. They didn't say they dropped the concept entirely- fuck I'm like a broken record. Why am I restating this on every post like this? There's a good chance that Claudio will return to writing Amory Wars concept and that this is new album is just an experiment (or at least a new breath of air.) Content creators should never pigeonhole themselves into one subject because of its success or of their initial passion. I wouldn't read this as the concept being gone forever, and I wouldn't look at this album as the descent of quality or something negative before it's even out."
TheFence,3cpeyd,KidGold,0,Thu Jul 9 22:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yea Coheed and Cambria isn't just a band it's a project. Without the concept it sort of feels like this is ""the band that does Coheed and Cambria"" coming out with an album."
TheFence,3cpeyd,ShadowWolf97,3,Thu Jul 9 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly, at least someone agrees. I feel like most people are too infatuated to question any of their idols' decisions. I've been a fan since 2009 (which isn't that long compared to a lot of fans), I have a Coheed tattoo, yet still, I'm not just willing to accept anything they decide as ""the right move"".  Now I get people are upset because I'm coming off as hostile, but just imagine how much more excited everyone would be if this was another concept, another countdown, another deluxe edition book, another incredible album experience instead of just... this."
TheFence,3cpeyd,TheMysticBard,2,Fri Jul 10 03:34:09 2015 UTC,"It's not that people are ""infatuated"", in my opinion, I think it's more that people trust the creative direction that Claudio, Travis, Josh, and Zach are going to take the band in. I'd  rather have a personal, true-to-life album that hits the highs and lows of Claudio's life adapting to being a father (and other such life experiences) directly through his eyes, than an uninspired, monotonic, concept album that forces him to meander around what he really wants to write and sing about. In my opinion, that is representative of what Year of the Black Rainbow is. Still a great album, but definitely my least listened to Coheed album because it felt a little bit bland and conceptual for the sake of being conceptual.   With that said, I respect and understand your opinion. The concept has always been an awesome addition to loving the band, but it's always been second to the music itself for me. I could not be more excited for this album, deluxe edition or not, but I hope you get some comics coming your way soon to tide you over too!"

TheFence,3cpeyd,BigSpence17,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:41:55 2015 UTC,"Frankly I think Claudio has outgrown the concept.  I mean, he's repeatedly said it was a way to shield himself behind a story to make writing about himself and his family easier.  At this point in his life I'm sure he feels he can just come out and say what he wants without needing to disguise it in a concept.  That's basically what went on with the Afterman; he wrote those songs about specific situations in his life, and dressed them up in the concept afterwards.  The story of the Afterman never struck me as genius or anything, and the idea of Sirus possessing other souls was just a way to work in these songs into the narrative.  I'm glad they're not just sticking with the concept just cause, especially if he's said all he wants to with it."

TheFence,3cpeyd,fifbiff,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:53:18 2015 UTC,"I don't see him sticking with a non-conceptual route. I think he's written so much already that now he may be at a bit of a loss as to where he should go next, but he still creates music from the heart. With the recent addition of his son to the family, he may be drawing more and more inspiration from real-life scenarios that he wants to depict in a fashion we can all relate to, rather than his usual cryptic-style of writing. After all, he has a lot more going on behind the scenes now than ever before now that he's a father. I think that he will return to the fiction, but for now I can't say I'm surprised. He's slowly been stepping out from behind his fiction and become a bit more transparent with each album since Good Apollo I. That allows for more personal, less conceptual writing, and we all know that the whole reason the concept exists at all is because that was his way of expressing himself and his emotions without really revealing his pain and the truth behind it all to the world. He's in a much brighter stage of his life I think, and if I was in his position, elaborating on certain parts of the fiction would only bring me back (in my mind) to those parts of my life. I'd be longing to take a step away. Then again, this is all just personal speculation and I could be off my rocker, but that's what I think."
TheFence,3cpeyd,evilcheesypoof,-7,Tue Jul 14 17:04:15 2015 UTC,So a lot of people have been shitting on me for being upset about this latest album announcement. I bring you guys this. Seems only three years ago Claudio agreed with me that non-concept Coheed is not Coheed.  Was having a child the reason for abandoning (or pausing) the concept?  Does it have nothing to do with that?  Can anyone make me feel better about this situation?  Thanks.
TheFence,3cpeyd,soggydave2113,9,Thu Jul 9 18:38:54 2015 UTC,"In their most recent documentary, Claudio said ""it's just there if you want it"" about the story. It shouldn't dictate every decision the band makes about new music or what direction they want to head in."

The song is just a bit too... vulgar. And it seems somewhat mean-spirited to be honest. Yeah, it could be a case of Claudio just writing the opposite of what we'd expect, but I'm not sure that's true.  Also, I feel like everyone is expecting this to be Atlas: The Album, so people are going to try and fit every song in that box. I seriously doubt even the majority of the songs will be about Atlas. Claudio probably knows people expect that, and he'll subvert it."

TheFence,3cnhpo,Trevmiester,7,Fri Jul 10 00:24:20 2015 UTC,"Very well analyzed; even the ""nobody gives a fuck who you are"" becomes more relatable and less insulting. Not that Atlas has people in his life that don't care about him, but rather he's a clean slate with no reputation yet.

Nobody cares what Atlas chooses to do; his whole life is ahead of him, and he can make his way for himself.  This is Claudio revealing the harsh ways of the world to a baby who doesn't really understand that yet... People don't care, Atlas is gonna be on his own, and Claudio is saying that Atlas can take that and make something good out of it.  And let's not forget, the opening riff is pretty much identical to that of the song ""Atlas,"" so I believe that in itself is an indicator of sorts."
TheFence,3cnhpo,itsmesoloman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:12:10 2015 UTC,"I get that impression as well.  This song could be about Atlas but it's not Claudio saying these things to/about Atlas.  Maybe there is some anxiety/resentment on Claudio's part that this is how the world views his sweet baby boy.  Alsoooo, there are a lot of people that have absolutely no patience with babies/children, so I could see Atlas throwing a fit in public and some asshole coming up and essentially saying ""Shut that entitled baby up"", and voila, a song is born."

Specifically the artists who dominate the scene  ""You've got spirit, kid. You're number one, just embrace the fall"" - As in atop the charts and destined to fall from the top because of a lack of progress as artists  ""The plastic king of castle polyethylene"" - The best seller for a scene that has lost its meaning and direction. It's mass produced, you're just the latest product they've churned out  ""I'll never have the chances you got"" - Coheed built their following and had to fight for major label support. They didn't have a look or a sound that fit in a neat little box to advertise and push to the masses.  ""Why are you crying.... When you've got the world to command"" - A shot at overly emo sound when bands are getting exposure and can have whatever they want. The lyrics are heartfelt and come across as genuine, but then there's no reason to be heartbroken forever when the industry has given them all of those chances and opportunities for success  I'm sure there are other ways of looking at it.

They are worried that Claudio is going to release this album and every song is going to be in the theme of ""I'm a father now!"" I don't get it.  Someone tried to break the song down to me to make it about his kid and it doesn't hold up.  I don't think Claudio is going to Scott Stapp this album.  The other is that people are worried that Coheed is selling out by releasing this single, when in all honesty, they ""sold out"" years ago.  I hate the term ""Sold Out.""  13 years ago when I was a high school kid, I threw that term around as a reason to not like some bands.  I'm an adult now, and I'm fucking telling everyone here, if someone asked me to play some pop music and make a ton of money, I would say yes so fast that the human ear wouldn't be able to process it right away.  I played in bands for a long time, so I know what it's like to be the struggling musician who wants to be popular.  To go touring and not have to worry about what you're gonna eat during the trip or who is driving or anything like that.  Adults need income and money and have families to support.  Selling out is important. Staying relevant is important for them. So what if they release a pop single.  Do you really think they give a fuck?"

They are all over the place, in a good way they just want to play what they want to hear. I say the people who are more into metal won't like the song and it's hard when the metal community does articles about them and a song like this comes on , a metalhead will question the site their on.

TheFence,3ciwk2,TheMysticBard,4,Wed Jul 8 08:10:38 2015 UTC,I agree with your sentiment however I find only one trivial flaw in your logic. The first two albums: Second Stage Turbine Blade and In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 where NOT released WITH any kind of comic companion. Those comics came years later. And the third album: Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV: Volume I: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness did have a graphic novel it was just not very descriptive or good (In my opinion). And we have as yet not gotten anything for No World For Tomorrow. Really only the last two albums (counting The Afterman as a whole complete concept spanning two records) were actually released WITH the extra content.   We DID still have awesome discussion and speculation for the story before the comics however and that will be missed without a concept.   The music will still kick ass and Coheed will forever be the greatest band in the world so we've got that going for is which is nice.
TheFence,3ciwk2,Lakrym,2,Wed Jul 8 15:23:42 2015 UTC,Seconded. They only recently started to release story content with their albums.

Hopefully it'll sound better when the album drops. It just sounds so, empty. Like something's missing.

Idk, even if there is a song or two about being a dad or having a family, I can't be bothered by it.

On the other hand, while I am a little surprised to hear about it... I'm also a little surprised it's taken this long, because as far as ""the main storyline"" is concerned... where else could you go? Admittedly, I'm not 100% sure on what the story in Good Apollo II NWFT (the ""last chapter (chronologically)"" that's been released) is - I can only assume that it's: Writer kills Ambellina, Claudio (the character) succeeds in killing Wilhelm and Mayo and also destroys the Keywork - Look at The Afterman: the story in those two albums takes place within the same Universe, sure, but it could have easily existed as its own thing. It was less ""storytelling"" in the sense of The Amory Wars as a whole and more ""worldbuilding"".  Plus, it's not like this is the first time a band has done something like this: Arjen Lucassen's ""Ayreon"" project spanned six albums (The Final Experiment - 01011001), each telling different parts of an over-arcing story (his second album, Actual Fantasy doesn't count), but then he started a totally new storyline with The Theory of Everything. And that's even counting the other ""projects"" he's done (solo work, Guilt Machine, Star One, and most recently The Gentle Storm). Heck, I've started something in the exact same fashion (a 7-(but potentially 9-)part series of concept albums taking place within the same Universe) and while I'm only one album in, I'm probably going to be stumped on how to continue it by the time I finish that set.  At the end of the day, I'm still anticipating this album just as much as I would have if it did have a storyline within The Amory Wars (or as its own thing). Like I said at the beginning, it's a bit of a bummer, but I can only roll with it."
TheFence,3cfh77,StrykrVII,2,Tue Jul 7 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping they pull a ""Human Equation"" where you listen to the album and it's not tied to the main story, but you are fine with it because it's so goddamn good...and then...and the last possible second...they reveal it is part of the story, and it changes EVERYTHING. You have to listen to it again, IMMEDIATELY to reshape the story in your head with its new connotations."
TheFence,3cfh77,neohylanmay,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:52:44 2015 UTC,"You could argue that Good Apollo I FFTTEOM was kind of like that; a totally different story, but still tied to the main one."

TheFence,3cfh77,KlaudioKil,2,Tue Jul 7 15:04:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we didn't even get a big rollout, no deluxe album preorder or tour announcement or even any album artwork. Looks like they split their big announcement in half because of the leak. Oh well. I love the new song and I'm still excited!"
TheFence,3cfh77,dubiousmage,4,Tue Jul 7 19:59:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's really a non-issue to me. Coheed has always been about music for me. The storyline of The Amory Wars is fantastic, for sure, and it's great that the band has been able to utilize that storyline to fuel their writing. But Claudio's even said in interviews, and in the Afterman coffee table book, that the story usually doesn't come first: he writes about things in his personal life, about things happening to the band, about current events; and mixes those subjects with parallels to these fictional characters.  So I don't think it's fair to say that there won't be a story. Any song that has words in it tells a story of some kind. You can't write a song about nothing at all. Really, he seems to be writing similar music, about similar topics, but this time we get to see it without the ""Amory"" filter on top.  Anyway, I'm excited. This has shown just another example of the band's versatility. And they're still my favorite band, making my favorite music. And hey, if they get concerned that the departure from Amory is problematic, maybe that'll lead into Good Apollo 1 and 2 comics."

Glad they are branching into uncharted territory, and it's Coheed.... those people who think they won't ever come back to an Amory Wars story or another story in the same universe are deluded. Give the man a chance to express his feelings through his own eyes and not a character he created. Seriously this selfish bullshit and being all butt hurt cause it's not what you wanted is getting ridiculous. So what if it's not in the storyline? I became a fan when SSTB dropped, and have been a fan of the band and music ever since. Not just the story. It's still going to be an amazing album, and I see a lot of people already judging it before anything more than this single comes out."

Two, Josh tweeted this out a while back: https://mobile.twitter.com/Weerd_Science/status/590187570732015616  ""The Carol Ann Collective."" Unless they opted to hold off on going in that direction, I think it will play a part in this coming  album. He also followed that tweet with one saying ""Songs. About time...""

Here's the issue though:  My Brother's Blood Machine is a 12 song album that tells an extremely compelling story that ends on a big cliffhanger.  I was so excited when I heard we were getting new PFI, so so so excited.  Half Measures is 4 songs long. 4 songs. Completely ignoring the concept he started - again. Regardless of how good people think the music is, as a huge fan of the concept, it's fucking annoying to keep seeing them start new stories and then not ever resolving them.   We still don't have Good Apollo II story. We still don't have a bridge between PFI and Amory. We still don't know what Sirus does next in The Afterman story.   Personally, I don't like tracks 1-3 on Half Measures but even if I loved them all I'd be just as upset as to how much they're ignoring their own concepts lately."

There's so much left in that story that we can't just assume it all works out.  I'm not excited to see how not having a story has an effect. The story tied it all together and made their entire discography feel constantly relevant. This new album makes them seem like they don't want to constantly be tied to the old albums - which I get, but I am very upset about as they been important to me for many, many years and I hate feeling like the band wants to move on from that era.  And yeah, NWFT. We still have no idea what the story for that album is. We have bits and pieces but no definite story comic or otherwise. We STILL have no clue who the gunslinger is. We STILL have no clue just what exactly ends up happening to the writer. That album released 8 years ago. This is why I'm upset.

Also, The Final Cut riff is in The Crowing. I swear there's another one in Willing Well I that I'm forgetting, I think it's one of the last riffs, ""Watching his tale, with the words he unfolds"", that whole section reminds me of Cuts Marked In the March of Men. There's tons more, but I'm busy at work ATM and can't do any research/listening.  EDIT: The 21:13 chorus chord progression is in Cuts Marked's chorus, the bit right after the chorus when the key changes is the bit I was talking about for Willing Well I (the ""Deliver"" section is repeated as well during the ""Could this be that hard for me"" section), and the same chord progression I've mentioned several times now is also in Willing Well III during the ""Wait"" section.

TheFence,3cdjsj,rode0clown,3,Tue Jul 7 09:18:09 2015 UTC,"This. Coheed's catalogue is full of reprisals. Apollo II: The Telling Truth is perhaps the best example of their penchant for calling back to earlier works. It is, obviously, reminiscent of Apollo I but it also contains elements of songs from earlier albums.  As to the purpose of this - I think it is intended have a connective effect. Reminds the listener that all of the music is from the same thematic place."
TheFence,3cdjsj,tyler32313,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"I mean it's exactly the same musically, i think the groove is a little harder or its slightly faster or theres more distortion on Apollo II. I've always figured one told a part of the story from the characters perspective and one told from the writers.  Waaay back in the day there was a grainy video of Claudio playing the ""Jesse Bad Boy"" part on an acoustic guitar, definitely looked like a Shabutie-era video. I remember reading back then it was an early version of Blood Red but idk how to confirm that. I also remember reading Claudio was trying to get rid of all of his old parts he had laying around for Good Apollo, so I always figured The Willing Wells were musically just a bunch of scraps he glued together."
TheFence,3cdjsj,rode0clown,4,Tue Jul 7 14:58:20 2015 UTC,Unrelated but I just listened to the songs and read the lyrics; Damn Claudio was reallllllllly fucking mad at Chondra.
TheFence,3cdjsj,yourbestfwend,3,Tue Jul 7 13:23:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of the same song.  Parts I and II.  Some of the lyrics in II call back to those in I, but slightly different.  Specifically, in Part One (The Writing Writer):  ""In my presence you might wake  Through this fiction I must fake  Your death to grace the face of my character  With these lessons he might learn  That all worlds from here must burn  For as God demands in the end we miss""  Then, in Part Two (The Telling Truth):  In my presence  You will make sure the fiction meets its fate  That death will grace your face my dear character  Through these lessons you have learned  All the worlds from here must burn  For as God demands that the end we miss."""
TheFence,3cdjsj,lethal909,3,Tue Jul 7 02:48:10 2015 UTC,"i'll make, you wish, you hadn't burned the time before"
TheFence,3cdjsj,papsh,3,Tue Jul 7 03:06:58 2015 UTC,"It's beyond symbolic. The first Apollo is the writers real life and the second is how it occurs in the story. Only the willing well stories technically takes place in the album so when you listen to it on its own it picks up where the story left off in in keeping secrets, but if you listen to the whole album its supposed to be the writers events in life and how they've influenced the story. I think it's pretty epic and transparent cuz you never see a story, or album, do that. Also the final cut technically comes after Apollo II in the story, ie. Ambellina's head was just cut off and now he's going off to destroy  Star IV and with it, the universe. Dammit how is this not a tv series yet!"
TheFence,3cb69h,TheRealHuntAndRob,18,Mon Jul 6 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"In his AMA Claudio said they don't keep in touch as ""we are not pen pals""  There was a thread with hearsay on what he's up to (deleted as it contained personal info) but he had a kickstarter for a new band which has yet to release or do anything and general consensus seems to be that drugs is what he's up to currently"
TheFence,3cb69h,VicTheButcher,3,Mon Jul 6 15:44:49 2015 UTC,"They did put out the EP through Kickstarter last year. They were doing small local shows for a while, but it seems they've been inactive for quite some time now. I had followed their Facebook page for a time, but discontinued as nothing was coming from it.  Their EP is actually on Spotify, Flux Forteana - September"
TheFence,3cb69h,BSet262,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"I'm stuck with my laptop for a week, otherwise I'd check myself, but is the EP any good?"
TheFence,3cb69h,Heroshade,2,Mon Jul 6 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"It's okay, it's nothing Coheed-esque. It's acoustic, and he actually has a nice voice. If you ever heard the bit he did for the original Neverender pre-show, it's sort of like that with extra accompaniment. It's nothing I'd go out of my way to listen to."
TheFence,3cb69h,BSet262,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:00:28 2015 UTC,"I just listened to about a minute of one song. I had to turn it off. The instrumentals aren't terrible, but the lyrics make no fucking sense. Definitely on drugs."
TheFence,3cb69h,JAdlon,3,Tue Jul 7 01:17:16 2015 UTC,"They did release their ep as stated, and honestly I think it's very good. As much as he's fucked up, I still look at him as a musical inspiration and most likely always will. I love the way he approached his bass lines and his solo guitar work is very listenable as well."
TheFence,3cb69h,Texaz_RAnGEr,0,Mon Jul 6 23:26:08 2015 UTC,I wonder If he used the crowd fund on drugs
TheFence,3cb69h,Jose_Monteverde,18,Mon Jul 6 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"Sad downfall of one funky-ass bass.  I really thought with a Josh ditching and Mic having his issues, the band was approaching an end. Was glad to see Claudio and Travis persevering through it all.   It is sad to think about Mic. I can only hope he's doing well, but that really doesn't seem to be the case.."
TheFence,3cb69h,xKaelic,19,Mon Jul 6 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"Josh had his problems, too. He just got over them and came out on the better side of it. Mic never seemed to have that ability. Which is a shame. That being said, I like Zach Cooper a lot and don't feel like the band is any worse for being without Mic."
TheFence,3cb69h,Xmaspast,10,Mon Jul 6 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"I like Zach and all, but one thing I miss about Mic is that the few times I saw him play with them, HE was the guy who was always talking to the crowd. Last couple shows I've been to, it's just been ""Hi, we're Coheed and Cambria,"" then maybe a ""Are you guys enjoying yourselves?"" half way through. Not a lot of interaction with the crowd in my experience. I miss Mic's billy-goat lookin' ass."
TheFence,3cb69h,Heroshade,5,Mon Jul 6 23:30:32 2015 UTC,"Claudio's always shied away from talking to the crowd.  There's that one bit on the SSTB Neverender where he asks the crowd if they want to hear him talk.  They of course respond yes.  His reply of ""You motherfuckers"" cracks me up evertim."
TheFence,3cb69h,lethal909,2,Tue Jul 7 02:43:03 2015 UTC,I just saw them in Burlington and Claudio asked if we were ready for new music. Of course everyone cheers and he says well we got nothing.  He also mentioned that the new Ghostbusters started filming today and I was hoping they would play the theme song like they did one Halloween.
TheFence,3cb69h,PenguinoMF,3,Tue Jul 7 03:38:49 2015 UTC,"""You ready for new music?""  crowd goes apeshit  ""Well it's on Youtube. Go get it, fuckers"""
TheFence,3cb69h,porcubot,9,Tue Jul 7 04:47:57 2015 UTC,"So true. I actually met Josh's ex-gf while at work, she was at the bar next door. She only had good things to say about him and that she had faith he'd pull through his hard times.   I'd imagine the life of drugs, sex, and rock and roll isn't nearly as glamorous as they want us to believe (though the allure is undeniable.)"
TheFence,3cb69h,xKaelic,7,Mon Jul 6 17:32:22 2015 UTC,I believe that Domino the Destitute was strongly based off the relationship between Mic and Claudio.  It's sad to see Claudio bummed out about it.
TheFence,3cb69h,StrikeAnywherePanda,5,Tue Jul 7 04:21:18 2015 UTC,"He talks a bit about it in the Afterman documentary. If I recall correctly, he didn't realize at first how much that song was about Mic."
TheFence,3cb69h,porcubot,2,Tue Jul 7 04:58:27 2015 UTC,His song Half Measures on the PFI album was written about Mic as well after his fall from grace.
TheFence,3cb69h,Krunchy1736,8,Tue Jul 7 17:14:57 2015 UTC,Mic was working on Flux Forteana (previously Flux Fortuna) and I donated to his Kickstarter but nothing really came of it. I ended up with three of his gold records though.

TheFence,3cb69h,Heroshade,6,Mon Jul 6 21:50:36 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there some debate as to whether the cancer thing was real or not, too?"
TheFence,3cb69h,ptb4life,3,Mon Jul 6 23:31:41 2015 UTC,"Cancer thing was definitely real. Unless he somehow carved himself up and did some really creative stage make-up, that was real.  I think it's a bit unfair to suggest that after he was cured he was telling people he still had cancer as if there is a stop date on cancer. I've had a few people in my family pass away from various forms of cancer and you aren't ever really cured. The people in my family had the best medical care at the time but there are quite a lot of false starts and finishes with those treatments. Mic did not have the best medical care at the time and I'd imagine there were up days and down days."
TheFence,3cb69h,spect0rjohn,2,Mon Jul 6 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"Beats me.  I just remember people believing he lied about it. Seems like something a junkie would do.  And as for ""looking the part""....I have a drug addict sister.  She looks like she's dying of cancer and/or AIDS....so it could have always been that with him"

TheFence,3cb69h,ptb4life,3,Tue Jul 7 17:42:02 2015 UTC,From what I remember the cancer was a lie as well. He kind of got really fucked up once he got tossed from the band.
TheFence,3cb69h,jululiby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"The cancer was real but he got treated. The thing was after he was cured, he continued telling people that he still had cancer."

TheFence,3cb69h,WhiteVenom1993,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:24:20 2015 UTC,You know what I mean. His cancer went into remission but he went on telling people he still had it.
TheFence,3cb69h,Legaato,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:30:34 2015 UTC,Really?! Wow..
TheFence,3cb69h,LOLRECONLOL,2,Tue Jul 7 19:29:25 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. I would be pretty surprised if they kept in touch. I feel like Mic is that guy at the party that everyone is shocked to see and says hi because they feel obligated. I mean bad blood or not, the four of them made kick ass music, it's to let the past be the past when you've toured, written, preformed and recorded for years together. And that's just music! They had to friends personally or none of the music would have worked!"
TheFence,3cftmh,mkdonald,20,Tue Jul 7 16:08:27 2015 UTC,"The band name is a brand. It's a very-well established brand. It's the same guys, writing the same kind of music.  Seriously. The one difference is that there's no sci-fi narrative between the songs and you're already declaring the band dead? How 'bout you wait for the album to come out first, huh?"
TheFence,3cftmh,porcubot,-5,Tue Jul 7 16:39:23 2015 UTC,"Not saying the band is dead, I am saying they should do right by the story of Coheed and Cambria and seal the book. I am as die hard a Coheed fan as the next guy but will just hate it if this non-concept paints them in a bad light."
TheFence,3cftmh,ElfTowerNewMexico,5,Tue Jul 7 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"This album not being a concept album doesn't mean the story is over.  Maybe Claudio wants properly finish the story that is already out there, whether this be with re-releasing comics or the Amory Wars movie, before he adds more to story.  He may of also been to busy being a father to write a full album and then a story to go along with it."
TheFence,3cftmh,iameveryone2011,7,Tue Jul 7 16:57:54 2015 UTC,You have to remember most people don't even know of the Amory wars and that the music has been part of it
TheFence,3cftmh,Tybob51,8,Tue Jul 7 16:41:47 2015 UTC,It's funny when people think bands can just change their name willy-nilly and not have their career drastically affected.
TheFence,3cftmh,Johnotronz,3,Tue Jul 7 17:09:15 2015 UTC,Coheed and Cambria is 4 guys making music for a significant fanbase. The story was always an auxiliary experience and the fanbase will digest this music the way they always have.

TheFence,3cftmh,melmou90,-2,Wed Jul 8 14:31:40 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree. I've been listening to Coheed for 10 years now and have loved every album and the connection to the overarching story. I was there through the dark years (NWFT, YOTBR) and saw a beautiful light at the end of the tunnel with The Afterman. And I am so totally fine with these guys doing a non concept album- I'd listen to 45 minutes of Claudio shitting into a steel bucket. I just wish it were under a different name.   There's precedence there as well, with some of the members of Yes creating Anderson Bruford Wakeman & Howe (albeit for 1 album), Dream Theater with Liquid Tension Experiment, not to mention all of Coheed's own side projects.   I'll see how I feel about the album when it comes out, but I might be renaming it to Sanchez, Stever, Cooper, & Eppard. Doesn't have the same ring to it as Emerson, Lake, &  Palmer but that's okay."
TheFence,3cftmh,LordNephets,5,Tue Jul 7 16:23:06 2015 UTC,But wasn't the afterman story written after the songs were already written? I think they can pull off a non concept album just fine.

TheFence,3bsr3z,oceanic_815,3,Sat Jul 4 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"With regard to the band's living, it's less about the leak and more about piracy in general. The fact that you got it early is irrelevant, what matters is that you didn't pay. If you want more information on how piracy affects bands, google it - it's a very well-trod discussion, with a lot of good points on both sides, and one that doesn't have a very simple conclusion.  A leak is only really a problem from an artistic standpoint - the band creates this album, and like all works of art, the way the creator decides to present it is important - things like artwork, track order, etc, are all considered and significant. When you leak a track and listen to it early, it's kind of like tasting a sauce before it's finished. You start to form an opinion, whilst the chef is sat there thinking - shut up, let me finish before you start trying to experience it. And you could say, well this is probably the final master of the track, so it's not gonna change between now and release. To return to the metaphor, sure, the sauce is nice when it's finished, but the chef made the sauce to be poured over his food. The track is part of a larger record - and I know as a musician that where a track sits in the context of the rest of a record is important, and people fucking with that can be annoying.  That said, personally I don't think it's a big deal. I discovered Coheed by downloading random tracks off Limewire way back when, and I later went out and bought the albums and got into them properly... It never stopped me appreciating anything. All I can say is, wait til the record releases before drawing any conclusions on anything."

This is mostly semantics and personally I've pirated every Coheed leak/album over the last 12 years and also given them several hundred dollars and bought almost every album up until the Afterman (which I didn't pirate, but became a victim of my Spotify premium usage).  Good on the non-force moderation of this though. I think moderation/banning threads is generally something that ruins communities.

While a shitstorm brewed on Facebook and Twitter, I was less worried about you guys. Shame on me.  ""I buy stuff from that store all the time. I can take a candy bar today, no big deal. You know how much I spend at that store?"" Stealing is stealing. If you want to paint it a different way to feel better about it, that's on you. Worse, the amount of self-entitled responses as to why people feel like they should have a leaked track is insane. Ironic considering the song in question.

Cause it seems like we aren't even supposed to know this song even exists as there's been no press on it being released on the 10th.   People saw the news and went searching for it and some found a way to purchase it no differently than when video game stores break street date on a new game. On that end the retailer is at fault. But then you have those who made the purchase and chose to share it, which is piracy.  People who want to download/pirate this track will do so no matter where it's posted. Plenty of Cobalters have it even with the ""censor"" in place about talking about it. If Management wants to discuss how it's being handled here we should have that discussion openly, as this seems to be more than just a song being released early as it doesn't seem like we were supposed to know about it.  The community is excited, and leaks happen. If management thinks we need to change how we respond as a community we need to have an open discussion AMA style so everyone understands what's up instead of the closed door mod discussions you see in other forums yeah?  Everyone here loves and even bleeds Coheed and I think most of us would respect a discussion with management on how we handle things here."

The place I work out literally gives out free material to bloggers and vloggers daily in order to spread the word about their product, and our product is much more expensive than a 99 cent song. I'm straying from my point-- I don't think we should be allowed to steal purely because we buy other things, I'm saying that the way the only official Coheed representative we have here is handling it poorly. It leaked. Want people to not feel left out or over eager to take for free? Post it on YouTube with ad revenue enabled. Release it on iTunes and Google Play.

So there's that. Say Coheed tries to counteract it by releasing it early, well there goes the deal with the website to stream it.

What boggles me is that when a link goes dead (obviously because someone involved with the band reported it), others replace it with another link. That's the issue. Are they not getting the hint that it's being taken down for a reason? Why is it okay to keep sharing it out in the open? At the very least keep it behind closed doors, so to speak. Keep it private. It's still stealing, but it's better than throwing it out into the ether.  You say the mods aren't ""playing along with the take down links and pretend nothing happened strategy"", which wouldn't be ""playing along"", it would be enforcing something that should be a rule. Don't share leaked material. In fact, by allowing links to be posted, they're basically saying ""hey, we think this is totally okay! Share all you want!"" and that is completely sending the wrong message. It says they're condoning this behavior. And it shouldn't be ""pretend nothing happened"", it should be acknowledge that this leak happened, but illegally sharing it shouldn't be allowed.  And people want to go to ""other, less safe places"", that's on them. They're pirating a song. Whatever consequences the face have nothing to do with this sub.

Coheed is a band, yes, but they are also a business. They couldn't do what they do if it weren't. People should be care about what keeps this band running. So when it comes to something like this track, just because it's a digital good doesn't mean it's exempt from the same rules that govern stealing physical items. The only difference is that the reproduction of digital goods is abstracted from the concept of physical goods.   I also really wish you understood that you are contradicting yourself left and right. Talking about fans ""desire"" to hear the song because they're ""super fans"" is justifying the theft. Nobody said that makes them ""monsters"", nor are they ""thieving children"" (but I would argue they feel entitled), but it doesn't mean what they're doing isn't wrong. Sure, they ""understand how the internet works."" I do, too. But the internet is a tool. It's all about how you use it.   And of course they are in favor of the decision! They want to hear new Coheed! So do I, but I respect the band enough to wait for the official release. Does that make me less of a fan? Does that rescind the 12 years, dozens of shows, probably thousands of dollars of purchases and endless support I've given the band? No, it doesn't. I'm saying that regardless of all that, regardless of my past and planned future money-throwing at the band, I still don't feel right listening to the track and I don't understand how anyone does. I get that that is just my opinion, but it shouldn't just be an opinion. How do you claim to love a band so much and then turn around and think it's okay to do something like this?

It's probably some combination of the two though.   As others have said, I hope this isn't representative of the whole album, but if it is, and the songs are all of this quality, then I'll be a happy velorium camper.   Maybe this album will be the polar opposite of GAI (My favorite album) whereas that one was forged by what was probably the darkest period of Claudio's adult life, this one will be forged by what is probably the happiest - leading to an album that is tonally the opposite while still reaching that peak level of quality.

TheFence,3btflq,Bowlermicah,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:00:37 2015 UTC,If this happens I called it in the thread announcing the song! But I think it would be awesome. It totally has the feeling and sound of a movie soundtrack! Also the album art lends itself very well to a movie soundtrack.
TheFence,3btflq,TheMysticBard,3,Thu Jul 2 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed what I heard, but it seemed like his voice should have been made more prominent in the mix. Maybe it'll sound better once the track actually comes out."
TheFence,3btflq,MCCapitalist,3,Thu Jul 2 01:03:18 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, but it sounds like a mix of The Afterman and Good Apollo Volume 1 somehow. I'm hoping not every song is like this on the next album (this one seems a bit generic, but I want to believe that if this song is on a future album, that it has some sort of relevance like Dark Side of Me.) At the same time, I like the song. I don't expect this next album to exceed Afterman (my favorite album of all time), but I'm thinking there's a lot of potential."
TheFence,3btflq,Yoshwa,2,Thu Jul 2 02:41:40 2015 UTC,"EVERY time I hear it, I picture it being the Favor House of the album. One of, if not, the most upbeat song on the record."
TheFence,3btflq,Ledhammer,3,Thu Jul 2 03:25:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how I feel about this.   First of all, it's weird hearing a new song without any sort of anticipation. No countdowns, no live performances, no teasers, just BOOM, a song. I know they planned on releasing it the 10th, but I still would've thought we would hear something from their camp by now if it was releasing in 8 days.   I don't think this is a standalone song, I've seen some people suggest that might the the case. Both the beginning and end sound like it is flowing from the previous/flowing into the next song.   Onto the song itself, it's... good. Nothing really jumps out about it. I'm not too keen on the lyrics, and the drum sound is different from what I'm used to with them. Claudio sounds great though, and I'm glad Travis' leads are more discernible than they were on a lot of the Afterman. The end of the song makes me really excited for what happens next.   All said, I like this song. I will probably like it more in the context of the album if it ends up being the AFHA, Suffering, Feathers, Goodnight Fair Lady, Away We Go, etc. of the album. New Coheed is always a good thing."
TheFence,3btflq,peanut-arms,2,Thu Jul 2 13:28:27 2015 UTC,"TO add to your comment about travis in the mix, I noticed the same with YOTBR as well as most of The Afterman, His leads add a lot of emotion to the music and is an equally amazing songwriter to Claudio"

I actually really dig the song, it does have a lot of Favor House in it, and I'm excited at what that jazz progression is going to bleed into. Only thing that sounded off to me was a few snare rolls that seemed very computer generated."
TheFence,3btflq,vapevapevape,4,Thu Jul 2 21:41:54 2015 UTC,"For everyone who's worried that every song will sound like this, when has every song on a Coheed album sounded the same??   I understand the concern though (I love it but I understand) but I see this as a favor house or suffering scenario. I wouldn't lose sleep   Also this might not even BE on the album.

The first four or five notes of Atlas and You've Got Spirit Kid are the same notes and played in the same offset two string pluck. Atlas has a faster tempo.

TheFence,3btflq,LOLRECONLOL,10,Thu Jul 2 01:13:35 2015 UTC,I have to disagree. Claudio has always pulled from life experiences and blended it phenomenally with his lyricism and fiction. The subject matter has just changed. I mean how many people are going to sing about wanting to tell their kids to shut the fuck up because noone cares? This is classic Coheed to me!

But it's very odd lyrics. Coheed has never been one for generic lyrics that make sense but ""you've got spirit kid, you're number one. Go on living that farce because no one gives a fuck who you are."" That's...new and somewhat dark? (Then again, Three Evils, Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops, but that fits the concept!) I don't know maybe it's all about Claudio never expecting his fame and still being shy about it. Also CANNOT wait to see how this album/song fits the concept, if it all. Sounds great, can't wait, 8/8 m8."
TheFence,3bnyoc,OMGitsDSypl,6,Tue Jun 30 21:42:08 2015 UTC,"If it means anything, Claudio was afraid of the song Dark Side of Me seeming too generic or cliche. I think he tries to avoid that sort of thing."

TheFence,3bnyoc,Bojarzin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:15:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's a good point. I kind of felt that way more and more since Good Apollo 1.

TheFence,3bnyoc,irascib1e,3,Wed Jul 1 12:27:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great tune. I like how it sounds like they're just trying to have fun which is refreshing. I think they have been wanting to just let loose for a while, but since their fans wanted to keep going with the story, they had to keep doing the serious heavy rock sound, the angry metal sound like in Sentry The Defiant.   But they can't keep doing that. They're not in an angsty point in their lives! Claudio isn't a young rebellious kid anymore. He's a mature adult, and now he has a kid of his own and is starting a family. Having a kid can be the happiest moment in someone's life, so why would he continue making serious heavy rock music like he's pissed off about something? Claudio said in his recent documentary that he doesn't enjoy making music anymore and he's having an identity crisis, but I think he just needed to stop taking the band so seriously and learn to have fun. I've been waiting for them to finally let loose and have fun for a while, because I can tell they've been really wanting it. So this song is refreshing to enter their discography."
TheFence,3bnyoc,melmou90,2,Wed Jul 1 12:26:09 2015 UTC,I thought the point of the documentary and what he was saying was that the new lineup breathed new life in the band and he was excited to write and tour again. And I guarantee a heavy hitter is right after this song judging by that outro buildup.
TheFence,3bnyoc,irascib1e,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:41:31 2015 UTC,I see how it can come off like he was saying that. Only Claudio knows what he was really trying to say. To me it seemed like he was getting it off his chest that he doesn't feel the same way about music. That makes sense to me too. You can hear that something changed in their sound after the third album.
TheFence,3bnyoc,OMGitsDSypl,6,Wed Jul 1 15:56:29 2015 UTC,The song sounds like it's in between Good Apollo Volume I and the Afterman albums. Kinda interested to see how that goes (and if this will tie into a future album or if it's standalone.)

Usually I'm a little hesitant when these first songs start getting played or are released but this one really strikes me as strange. This is the poppiest song yet.  Easily. It trumps The Suffering which is hard to do. Also the somewhat excessive bad language is strange to me. I'm not saying it's good or bad, it's just weird to hear SO much.  I'll try to let myself warm up to it I guess."
TheFence,3bnyoc,TheChrimbiest,2,Wed Jul 1 05:40:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think the profanity is excessive at all, it fits the tone of the lyrics nicely. Sarcastic, scathing, critical, almost mean-spirited. The song itself does sound pop-y, but historically with C&C, there can be a lot of lyrical dissonance; the music being played doesn't necessarily reflect the lyrics 100% of the time.  Of course this is what I can gather from this song, independent of what the rest of the album is going to sound like. Context is pretty much required to be able to truly experience C&C's music as a whole."
TheFence,3bnyoc,afireinside30x,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:09:20 2015 UTC,"In the context of music in general it's not excesssive, and I agree that it fits the tone, but speaking from a purely Coheed standpoint it's excessive. No other song comes close to this much."

TheFence,3bnyoc,iameveryone2011,4,Tue Jun 30 20:00:42 2015 UTC,"I've listened to it and I've thought that this song is one of three things.    It is could be written for a movie. It sounds a lot like a movie soundtrack song. It's nearly all chorus. Also it is very unlike Claudio to swear this much in a 'normal' Coheed song. I can only think of Welcome Home and The Final Cut. Other songs get tagged Explicit but for suggestive themes not language. Or it is straight up a song about not giving a single shit and doing what ever the hell you want. The lyrics could mean throwing caution the wind, and being you because no one cares who you are or what you do. You do what you want...because nobody gives a fuck! One of the lyrics is ""be a good little pig"" meaning go ahead, follow the norm, but It's your life, so live it. It could be a message for Atlas. Grow up and be the person you want because no one gives a fuck! Either way it's decent. I like it, but it's weird and going to take sometime to warm up. This is all apart of the or a concept. and it's one character, presumably the main charcter, literally saying 'Fuck You' to this other person (Plastic King of Castle Polyethylene?) for wronging them. Any of these is pretty awesome!"
TheFence,3bnyoc,VicTheButcher,2,Wed Jul 1 04:30:29 2015 UTC,I think 2 and 3 are what we're hearing. We know Claudio writes lyrics based on his life so I feel like this will be an Afterman-like album with Atlas as the main character..except it's an Atlas of the future...one of the many things he could grow up to be as a character in this crazy universe his dad has created! :)  Nobody gives a fuck who I am? But I've got spirit..I'm number one..  I don't know but I do know this song has me very excited!!

TheFence,3bball,StrafingLobster,5,Sat Jun 27 17:54:59 2015 UTC,It does feel like every tour lately is mostly IKS with just the most popular songs from the other albums filling up the set. Why do they ignore so many of their songs live?
TheFence,3bball,Pete_Worst,4,Sun Jun 28 03:18:55 2015 UTC,"Because they're still practicing all of IKS the most due to the Neverender tour dates coming up for it?

TheFence,3bball,SirNarwhal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:15:41 2015 UTC,"I think at this point they could play the IKS songs in their sleep, as they just did a massive leg of IKS Neverender and played them all every night.   Seriously, does Ten Speed need to be in every setlist? It's a great song but why not Once Upon Your Dead Body or Mother May I or any of the Willing Wells besides The Final Cut? Does the title track for NWFT need to represent the album every time - why not The Hound or Radio Bye Bye?   It's just a little frustrating seeing this band and getting the same songs over and over again. If they need to ""practice"" an upcoming tour, that should be done on their own time. But they're selling out every show so fuck me I guess."
TheFence,3bball,Pete_Worst,2,Mon Jun 29 23:09:47 2015 UTC,I don't think you remotely know how much prep goes into a single tour however small it may be. EVERY act/band practices what they will perform on that tour right before it; you can't just swap out songs easily unless you're like Radiohead and practice like 100 songs for their tours.

Also they have to prepare before hand, switching in songs at random would be risky at best"

It was a perfect storm for me that they toured together during a period that they were my favorite bands playing set lists from my favorite albums.   Coheed was my favorite at the time but they were the clearly way behind in popularity compared to the Thrice/Thursday. They even lost power mid-set and rolled with it like champs, they certainly converted their share of new fans that night. Coheed's word of mouth game was on point back then."

The second EP by Shabutie features five songs played by the band back in the late 1990s. Penelope is one of the two Shabutie EPs with songs not repeated or played as Coheed and Cambria (the other is the Plan to Take Over the World). The band members at this time were Claudio Sanchez on vocals and guitar, Nate Kelley on drums and backing vocals and Michael Todd on bass. Travis Stever would rejoin the band as the band's second guitarist after this recording was completed. Shabutie's heavier songs ('Kinderwhore' and 'Godfather's Lollipop' in this case) had the tendency to include sexually explicit lyrics. This album was released after the success of their first EP Plan to Take Over the World but did not fare as well due to the limited availability of the album.

Claudio was saying how fortunate the band is for being able to be out playing and touring for the last 13 years, and he said they were going to play 3 songs from their first album. They played Junesong Provision and then had to walk off stage because the lightning was getting bad. When they came back, they didn't play anymore from the first album, which was a bummer, but the rest of the show was awesome. Junesong Provision is one of my favorite songs. I really wish I could have stuck around and met some of the guys from the band, but I had a 2 hour drive right through the heart of the storm to get home. Needless to say, I took Tuesday off work."

TheFence,3awhh9,VoteLobster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the true meaning behind The Running Free, but it kinda matches a vibe with a book series by Kathryn Lasky called Guardians of Ga'Hoole. In short, there are sentient owls and in this one family of owls, a brother betrays his younger brother and ends up sending him to a nazi-esque camp (via a kidnapping). A majority of the owls sent there are brainwashed and ultimately contribute to the construction of a weapon that harms other owls. The main character befriends another owl and escapes, while simultaneously finding other friends along the way and overcoming his lost innocence (throughout the series.) He aims to find a group called The Guardians of Ga'Hoole in order to raise awareness of the nazi-esque organization so they can save everyone else. As weird as it sounds abridged, I feel that the song resonates with it pretty well. ""You've come so far from innocence, provided all the consequence, only what does it matter now?"""

From Nate at Fusion Shows ""Once it got close enough to us to have lightning striking in the area, we immediately asked Coheed's crew to shut the show down.  We attempted to have everyone take cover inside or in their cars, to which about 80% of the crowd immediately obliged, but some folks wanted to tough it out.  Once the tornado warning was called and the sirens went off (due to rotational cloud formations in the area, and not due to any tornados having touched down in the area), we were a bit more forceful in our evacuation of the outdoor space.  About 20 minutes later, a group of folks started cheering and ran through our security at the back door, and the masses followed back into District Square.  This was not OK'ed by anyone with the promoter, venue, or band's camp, and it's the only ""mistake"" I feel like we made last night. The crowd just did what it wanted to do, and we didn't do enough to stop it.  I believe this gave everyone the false idea that the show was going to start up again soon, but our teams were inside the office, studying the radar and trying to make the safest and best call we could."""

I left when I did because I was not prepared to risk my life to watch Coheed play. Take that however you want but from what I saw online of the second half the band should have never taken the stage, especially when they delayed the concert for much less.  Also, you think it's cool to watch a show with tornado sightings and epic lightning? How about you drive to Portland and ask them how they feel about epic lightning and tornado sightings. See if they think it was super rad. A tornado might not have touched down in Kzoo but the fact of the matter is there was a very real possibility of a touchdown. I drove home and watched a funnel cloud form that was coming from Kzoo.  I don't want to see any of their upcoming shows. I paid $64 for a friend and I to drive a total of 3 hours there and back to get a hat and hear 6 songs from Coheed. In the end, whether they issue to refund or give the free tickets, they are still going to be ""out"" the $28. It all comes down to how they want to be out."

Probably the most chantable choruses along this side of Coheed. This has been my favorite band to get hype for Coheed shows with, check em out! Protest the Hero, similar vocal stylings but with more hardcore and metal influences than Coheed's pop-punk version of hardcore. Basically take Coheed make it wankier on guitar and faster. Sikth, kind of important to bridging modern metal with more progressive stuff after Death stopped being a band in like 2002. Frantic, fast paced and almost irreverent in their approach to everything. This is Dillinger Escape Plan minus the hXc roots and plus more guitars. Relentless! Minor Plains if you like prog, which it really seems like you do. This is the best prog band of the last 10 years, in my opinion, especially if you have a thing for the longer stuff. Wild Throne if you want prog but a little bit heavier and more intense Mastodon if you want heavier than that Lord Mantis or Indian if you want some supremely heavy stuff. This is punishing and dangerous sounding for the first time in ever. Not good if you can only listen to clean vocals.   For vintage prog stuff, like it looks like you might be into, I listen to a shit ton of Jethro Tull. Jethro Tull and Yes were formative for my taste in music, with Yes covering the more ethereal and Jethro Tull being a tad more earthy in their execution of the whole prog rock thing. I don't listen to a ton of Pink Floyd anymore, but there was a big chunk of time where The Wall was on repeat in my car for sure. King Crimson is also a good choice if you haven't gone down that route, as would be Gentle Giant, the Strawbs and Earthless."

TheFence,3al6xr,protest023,4,Sun Jun 21 07:44:22 2015 UTC,"First off, when it comes to Second Stage, the lyrical relation to the story is very weak. When Second Stage was written, the story was VASTLY different than wheat it ended up being.   When In Keeping came out, the story was changed to what it is today, so when Claudio started coming out with the comics years later, he had to write the SSTB comic to both match the current storyline, and the lyrics on the album... so it's all a little messy. So you'll see things introduced in the SSTB comic, that don't get referenced until later in the music, because that relationship needs to be established.   Ambellina, for example, is an important character in the In Keeping story, but the isea of her didn't even exist in the old SSTB story. When it was rewritten, she was put in there to establish her as a character."

TheFence,3a7hh8,dustyeff,2,Thu Jun 18 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"SSTB - Not nearly as progressive as the next two, but I love how prominent the band's post-hardcore/emo influence on this album. Definitely was a gateway for me getting into stuff like Cap'n Jazz. I think what makes this album stand out from other records of the era is the complex, syncopated grooves Josh and Mic tend to slip in every song. The way their rhythms weave around Claudio's off-kilter, staccato power chords is so damn exciting and defines Coheed's sound during this era.  IKSSE:3 - Coheed's best album, IMO. I think they really hit the sweet spot between their catchy pop sensibilities and progressive rock ambitions here, exploring both styles on the album and combining them very effectively on tracks like ""The Crowing."" The post-hardcore element is dialed back but it's definitely worth it to hear their take on classic, metal-tinged prog rock (best expressed on the title track and ""21:13,"" probably their most well-realized prog epics ever). Claudio's songwriting skills are also at an all-time high -- the album is just bursting at the seams with creative riffs, emotionally resonant lyrics and melodies that can only be described as ""classic."" Topping it all off is Claudio's voice, which rings out clear as a bell throughout the entire record with authenticity, sensitivity and emotion. A classic in every regard, and quite literally the only album of its kind.  GA1 - A very schizophrenic album, which is kind of fitting given the subject matter. What album do you know of that starts with a gentle acoustic ballad before pummeling you with an imposing Iron Maiden/Led Zeppelin hybrid, then settling into a nice pop punk groove for the next two songs? Honestly, I never took to this album like I did the first two, but over time I've come to notice at least how great the guitar parts are on this record. I love all the little harmonies and lead parts sprinkled throughout the album, and the beefy, Marshall-enhanced guitar tones are just irresistible. The closing ""Willing Well"" suite has some of the most exciting moments of prog-rock musicianship in the band's catalog and gets almost astonishingly heavy in parts (""As father told son, in the make of his final mistake""). Unfortunately, the shorter songs are just ""OK,"" and only ""The Suffering"" matches the hookiness of IKSSE:3. I SO wish they would have gone ""full prog"" and made an entire album of ""Willing Well""-type tracks, but I suppose that would have been impossible, given the major-label confines they were operating within. Still, a great example of the band's continued growth and development.  Bonus points for having Claudio's all-time greatest ""woah-oh"" moment toward the end of ""Crossing the Frame.""  NWFT - A pretty huge departure from the previous records. Gone are the unorthodox song structures, tricky prog-rock breaks and much of the band's pop-punk/emo influence. But guess what? I still friggin' love it! The opener is a total balls-to-the-wall, Iron Maiden-influenced metallic rocker, and everything that follows similarly seeks to show off the band's classic rock influences (Judas Priest on ""The Hound of Blood and Rank,"" Van Halen on ""Feathers,"" Pink Floyd on every guitar solo on the album). Claudio's songwriting is absolutely fantastic, and he dispenses one epic, sweeping rock-and-roll chorus after the other throughout the record. The album's closing suite, ""The End Complete,"" is not nearly the prog epic ""The Willing Well"" was, though the second part comes close, going from an ominous opening to a chaotic middle part before seamlessly settling into a gentle, melancholy ending. It's probably my favorite transition in the entire Coheed catalog.  Oh, as you all know Josh departed before this album, and while his quirky grooves are definitely missed, I think Taylor Hawkins/Chris Pennie serve the more simplistic direction the band was going in here very admirably.  YOTBR - An even bigger departure than NWFT, this album completely severs whatever ties remained to C&C's emo-punk past, along with nearly all of the band's classic rock influences and catchy pop sensibilities. In other words, almost everything that made Coheed Coheed is gone, leaving us with an epic, imposing alt-metal record. And would you believe I actually like it a lot? The hooky melodies and riffs are gone, but I don't think that's the point here - this is an album about atmosphere, and it has atmosphere in spades. I think Claudio's turns in some of his most epic and expressive vocals on this album (particularly on the bridge of ""The Broken"" and the chorus to ""This Shattered Symphony""), and the slow-to-midtempo grooves make the already foreboding riffs sound positively ominous. The electronics and drum loops are controversial to say the least, but I don't think they're too intrusive (I, for one, especially love the bit-crunched guitar solo on ""Guns of Summer""). My biggest beef is with the production: I think the band was going for a very big, cinematic sound, but at many points the mix simply sounds distorted. This is not a popular album among fans, but it's worth another look if you're able to check your expectations at the door.  Afterman 1/2 - I really wanted to like these albums, but I just can't get past my initial feeling of ""meh."" At long last Josh is back behind the kit, and I was hopeful this -- combined with the band's freedom from major label constraints -- would herald their return to prog-rock complexity and choppy, off-kilter grooves. Instead, these albums are more a combination of YOTBR-style electronics and NWFT-style Maiden worship. There are a couple of nice experiments (horns on ""Number City,"" Latin-style rhythms on ""Evagria the Faithful), and I LOVE the classic rock tributes on each album (""Goodnight, Fair Lady"" is to Thin Lizzy as ""The Hard Sell"" is to Pink Floyd), but I can't help but feel like there's just something I'm not getting. It's likely I need to spend more time with these albums -- GA1 was a one-star album as far as I was concerned until a YEAR after I got it, so that might not be a bad idea. In the meantime, though, they're probably last on my ranking of Coheed albums.  edit: holy long post batman. sorry, i've been drinking beer after beer all night and i guess i got carried away. oh, well, it's here for anyone who wants to read my insane ramblings about C&C's albums."
TheFence,3a7hh8,feellikeapeanut,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:19:39 2015 UTC,"(prepare for essays and unpopular opinions)  SSTB: I've only listened to the album once or twice in a row and a few songs selectively, and I still need to revisit it, but I'm not a fan of it. There are some good qualities for sure, but I feel that the songs are a bit impromptu in lyric writing, the vocals, or somewhere else. It kinda feels like they were trying to go for a punk vibe and they wanted to make the album seem organic (not too tidy, I guess? I don't know how to explain it.) At the same time, the lyrics can be good/strong and at times poetic. I think it excelled in an instrumental sense more than anything. Really though, I just need to listen to the album some more so I can have a better opinion on it.  IKSoSE3: It took me 2-3 listens through the album before I could love it. I loved the intense passion in a lot of the songs, especially in IKSoSE3/The Crowing/Backend of Forever/The Light & The Glass, and I loved how a lot of the songs were able to convey a mood. Faint of Hearts was the first IKS song I heard thanks to Pandora, and it was one of the songs that made me interested in the band. The songs seem to have tidier lyrics, vocals, and instruments that gives some songs a better groove or intensity. While there are some songs that sometimes feel like filler to me (namely the song immediately after IKSoSE3, sorry if it's unpopular opinion), I enjoy most of the album.   GA1: I liked this album a lot, but I feel there are a lot more filler feeling material in the album, and not just as individual songs, but in certain moments during some songs. For example, this moment in Once Upon Your Dead Body. Some parts just feel redundant as hell, but being that this is a mostly pop album, it works I guess? There's definitely some groove in the album, so it's good to listen to. The one thing I dislike the most is that some songs are very similar to each other in the way that they aren't so distinguished. I personally loved Welcome Home, Wake Up, and Willing Well II. It's not Coheed's best or worst album, but I enjoy listening to it when I work.  GA2: This album excels from the previous three by having more diverse songs and somehow more emotion than IKSoSE3. This album had the song that made me fall in love with Coheed (Feathers, thank you based Pandora), and the song that actually hit hardest with me on an emotional level (Mother Superior). The album as a whole has a good edgey vibe with some gritty lyrics (specifically in The Hound and Mother Superior). There are still some moments of filler that GA1 had (like in Radio Bye Bye), but it feels less prominent. It's my second favorite Coheed album.  YotBR: I liked some songs, but it feels more filler-y than ever. With this album, I only like a particular few songs (namely Here We Are Juggernaut, Pearl of the Stars, and the Broken.) It was overproduced to shit, sure, but my main problem was with the content. It felt a bit lacking, and I wanted to enjoy the song as a whole. Sometimes, the songs would feel awkward, so I would tend to skip them. It's either the worst or second worst album for Coheed, but it has a few gems. If anything, it did have a good chaotic tune, especially in the instrumental moments of The Broken.  Afterman (as a whole): THIS FUCKING ALBUM. This is the thing that made me LOVE Coheed. It might be because the story is easier to jump into than the other ones, but the concept drove the music even further for me. A man whose morals are based around his scientific curiosity has to lie to the whole world about his findings on the afterlife. That's fucking cool! Story aside, the Afterman is definitely one of the most diverse albums there. Each song is dramatically different from another, and that helps every song shine in its own way. The songs are perfectly characterized by the accompanying concept art and both of those perfectly symbolize each moment or character in the songs. The Afterman is easily my favorite album(s) and I still love each song to death."

I can't tell if he's purposely changing his voice or it's the ""accent"" slipping. Like for instinance, in the suffering, the lyric is ""I may be invited, girl, but I'm not coming in"". The speed of the song makes it sound as if Claudio is saying ""invited"" like 'inviyded'. Just a slight extension of second ""I"". It's things like that that I am talking about."

I remember the album finally coming in the mail with the preorder shirt I still wear to this day(despite its declining shape). I listened to nothing but it for, God, I don't know. Weeks?

TheFence,39j71c,Destrina,2,Fri Jun 12 09:20:52 2015 UTC,"I think that objectively speaking that's actually the best kind of review. The writer understands the place of the album in the band's discography because they're relatively familiar with it, but they're not so enamored by the band that it becomes a slobbery fanboy circlejerk. I think this review is realistic about the place GA1 occupies for your average modern prog fan or review reader, not for those of us that take the time to regularly post on /r/thefence or Cobalt and Calcium.  IMO, people who consider themselves CotF should generally not be reviewing Coheed because obsessive fans turn off potential listeners by heaping inordinate praise on albums or shows that aren't actually that great. The fan bases of certain cult bands are sometimes one of the biggest barriers to entry simply because they can be so irritating (see Phish phans, Tool bros, Rush obsessives, Deadheads)."

Why u do dis  Also:   Likewise, each of its successors (including its direct sequel, 2007’s Good Apollo, I’m Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow, commonly shortened to just No World for Tomorrow) has maintained the same beloved elements in similar syntheses,   No. Have you listened to NWFT? Look, it's a good album, but it lacks a ton of the elements that make GA1 what it is, including extended song structures/through-composition (the Willing Wells), reprises (Apollo I and II), etc. Every song on that album was radio-ready, predictable song structure, poppy hooks and catchy choruses, over-emphasis on solos instead of bridges and melodic breaks. Don't get me started on Black Rainbow. They've retained as much Good Apollo writing style as they have Second Stage writing style. In fact, before Afterman I would've said they've abandoned that particular sound.   including didgeridoo player Chester Brockwell, ukuleleists Kara Bullock and Nick Gardner, and even Sanchez’s niece, Janiris, on vocals.   This is just me being picky. They should've mentioned Daniel Sadownick for his work on auxiliary percussion, who the band was so impressed with they had him on stage during Neverender.

The video for Here We Are, Juggernaut features some imagery that relates to the story, particularly the dragonflies and the Black Rainbow, but the people you're referring to in the video aren't the literal characters Coheed & Cambria. They may be analogues to the characters, though. Furthermore, the events depicted in the song Here We Are, Juggernaut, have little to do with what happens in the music video. For example, the Juggernaut itself is not in the video, though it is depicted in the appropriate section in the book (which happens to be the first thing you read about.)

My SO & I met, bonded and eventually fell for each other over our mutual love for Coheed & Cambria (among many other things).  Fast forward down the line and it's our 2 year anniversary - I really want to get him something meaningful rather than standard anniversary-ish stuff, as thinking where we are now (house, cat, all round unbelievably happy lives) compared to where we were & what we had to go through to be together is something I need him to know I haven't forgotten or take for granted.   We both love The Amory Wars comics and graphic novels but his collection is incomplete: TAW Volume 2: 1-3, In Keeping Secrets 3: 1-3.    Our mutually favourite album is Second Stage Turbine Blade and we have shared many special moments to this album, so it's even more sentimental.   My trouble is - I can't find Second Stage on Vinyl anywhere for less than £100!? Is this cos we're in the UK? Or is that really about right? cos I had no idea it would be that rare!   So my first question is: Does anyone know where I can find the Vinyl in the UK /Online (maybe I'm looking in the wrong places) for a realistic amount?  Second: What graphic novels/comics from the TAW collection do you think I should get? Fill in the missing editions for the volumes he already has? Or try (really hard) to find to Second Stage graphic novels (as that's his favourite album).   Any recommendations for where I should be looking will be so helpful and really will mean the world to me if I can get these for him.   Posted in /r/coheedandcambria too.   Thanks!"

Its hard for me to describe, but its pretty much that the music sounds like it was tuned so much after it was actually recorded that parts of it start to sound artificial, and not in a way that I could possibly imagine was intended.   Like, the album sounds like it spent more time in post production than it did being recorded.  Which is a huge difference to the feel of the other albums, which, while clearly having production done on them, feel pretty raw and natural sounding."

TheFence,37hb90,MTSL-Mantra,7,Sat May 30 00:02:16 2015 UTC,"To start with, I wouldn't call it a bad record, I would just call it their worst. Other people say that as well.  The record feels overproduced, sure, but my issue is in the song writing itself. For a lot of the songs on this record, something feels like it's missing. Coheed is, for me, at its best when they can do this strange musical wizardy and go a bit over the top, and still bring me into a beautiful and interesting hook. Those hooks aren't there on this record for me, and when they come close is when the over production takes it away for me. Far comes to mind as a song that has a chorus akin to what I'm describing, but I get so distracted by a lot of the other stuff that went on with that track that it doesn't bring me in like it should.  Now, this is just my opinion, but I think part of the cohesiveness I'm trying to describe was lost when Josh left. A lot of people swear by NWFT, but for awhile that was pretty low on my list as well for Coheed records, I certainly put it under all of the other material (with Good Apollo probably being my #1). I think, and once again this is just my opinion, that Josh must have brought something to the table as far as songwriting is concerned that brings the songs together for me. Meanwhile, Chris Pennie is a very technically proficient player, and I feel like the best example of the vibe he brought to Coheed is Guns of Summer. I think Guns of Summer, while not necessarily a bad song, is fairly indicative of the issues I have with the record. Over the top, over produced, and lacking what I consider to be the beautiful hook that Coheed does like no one else does."
TheFence,37hb90,PeanutNore,6,Wed May 27 19:13:56 2015 UTC,That's what no one gets. Josh is the secret sauce. I think he might encourage or enable a bit of a experimentation with Claudio that Chris couldn't provide. Also I think he does the piano parts.

TheFence,37hb90,FlyingPiranha,10,Wed May 27 22:48:00 2015 UTC,"My complaint is with the songwriting and arrangement. A lot of people complain about the production, and yeah I have my bones to pick with Atticus Ross and Joe Barrisi  BUT  The Broken, Here We Are Juggernaut, and Guns of Summer are fantastic songs. What's more, the production fits them- all the weird layered sound effects, the long reverb tails behind the vocals, the synthesizers, and the focus of fuzz over crunch with regards to guitar tone. The production creates textures and soundscapes. It's certainly not what Coheed is known for, but it's not bad by itself.  Far (arrangement doesn't fit rest of album), Made Out Of Nothing (boring chorus), Pearl of the Stars (should have stayed a PFI song), In the Flame of Error, When Skeletons Live (both generally weak songs)- none of these songs work to the album's advantage, for various reasons. World of Lines and Shattered Symphony miss some opportunities to be great but they are by no means bad. The Black Rainbow needs more variation and harmonic movement and needs to be about three minutes shorter, but once again, not necessarily bad.  The saddest part is, some of the best songs on this album are the two demo tracks and an Itunes bonus song called Hush (which could have been one hell of a single; now you fucked up, Columbia Records)  And let's talk about Chris Pennie: a stellar drummer in his own right, but completely the wrong fit for Coheed and I have a hard time believing he was picked by the band members themselves. His performances (beyond Guns of Summer) generally lack magic or inspiration and are entirely forgettable. Getting Josh back was probably the best thing that could've happened for the band.  In closing, I've probably offended a few people with my opinions, but they're the result of hours wasted thinking about this kind of stuff."
TheFence,37hb90,coheed78,4,Wed May 27 21:20:08 2015 UTC,"No dude, you're fine, and raise excellent points for discussion.   I agree with your points about the textures and soundscapes that those songs make, and also sorta agree with the songs that aren't up to par or don't necessarily fit in with the album. Made Out of Nothing did fall a little short, but Shattered Symphony and World of Lines are one of my favorites on the album, along with The Broken, Guns, and Juggernaut.   I personally loved Chris' time with the band, and thought he brought a lot to the table. I love that Josh is back, and he is the better fit for Coheed, but I've always been a little sad that Chris is gone. YotBR wouldn't have been the same if Josh was with them at the time.  And I also love his drumming during the Neverender Tour (minus the drum solo in Willing Well IV, which kinda dragged on). The band had a sort of ""different"" energy during that tour compared to the recent IKS tour."
TheFence,37hb90,DamnDirtyTaylor,1 point,Thu May 28 00:12:05 2015 UTC,I agree on everything you've said here. It's an album that starts strong and fizzles fast. And I feel like you're the only other person that agrees with me that Pearl of the Stars is just flat out a Prize Fighter track and not a Coheed track through and through. I see so much love for it and it just doesn't work with the full band arrangement compared to the Prize Fighter one.
TheFence,37hb90,onionknight22,1 point,Thu May 28 04:09:09 2015 UTC,"I politely disagree with Pennie not being the ""best fit"" for the band, because he was a lot better both technically and with understanding the band's dynamic range - better than most people off the street. As a live drummer for them for as many years as he had been, he was a good fit after Josh left and didn't really change the original rep too much. Yes Guns of Summer has a ton of technicality to it, but Pennie used to be in Dillinger Escape Plan, so it's not inherently surprising. For the most part, though, dude just kept time and did his job. Lol I personally think that they started experimenting more with electronic sounds more because of Pennie (dude has a degree from Berklee in Music Production, I believe), which has helped their Afterman sound be what it is, but I think YOTB as a whole was such a drastic ""experimental"" turn from previous records that most Coheed fans wrote it off. There is some good stuff there, though. Minus the songs that were singles except for Juggernaut. Wasn't feeling them too much."
TheFence,37hb90,DamnDirtyTaylor,3,Mon Jun 8 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"I love it a lot. Top 3 or 4 for me. The different direction they went with was great, I love to see bands try something new, and it turned out awesome. a Lot of people take this ""It's different so I hate it."" attitude to things they like. Music, TV shows, books, you name it. It happens all the time.   To me, just cause it was different doesn't mean it was bad. If people could judge it on its own merits and not in comparison to the rest of Coheed I think they'd end up with the same answer.  It sounded over-produced and the drumming was intense and a focal point to the songs, but that's what I like about it! It was different  but still amazing. I'd rather take another YotBR than another Good Apollo, even though I LOVE the Good Apollo albums, just cause I don't want to get the same albums over and over, like AC/DC for example."
TheFence,37hb90,onionknight22,3,Wed May 27 23:25:47 2015 UTC,"YotBR was my first Coheed album, actually. I checked it out because I'm a huge Dillinger fan and I wanted to see how Chris Pennie sounded outside of the context of a noisy, mathy band. Instantly fell in love with the band because of the dense, produced sound of the album, along with the intricate drumming and proggy songwriting."
TheFence,37hb90,DamnDirtyTaylor,3,Wed May 27 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan. Pennie is a fantastic drummer, but I think he was an exceedingly poor fit for the band. Add the overproduction and the clear artistic pressure from Sony/Columbia, and it's easily their worst album in my opinion."
TheFence,37hb90,eskimobob117,7,Thu May 28 02:28:16 2015 UTC,"So Year of the Black Rainbow was, in my opinion, a key point in their career. To me it was the final push away from the grunge sound of SSTB and IKSSE:3 that they started out with (Also what got me to love the band) and into the new age progressive sound we started to hear in the Burning Star IV volumes. YotBR was what set them apart from any rock group I think anyone has heard. Also being a devoted fan and reading the book really connected the listener/reader with the music more than the other albums. So personally I love the album it was edgey in the sense of pushing the boundaries of prog rock, the boundaries of what the band could do, and how loyal the fans were to the music and story. It really made the band that much better."

The songs were rough, and they were mixed with this feel as if they were trying to go into a raw state of sound.  As if they were trying to time travel to a previous state of the band.  No World for Tomorrow was mastered almost perfectly.  That album was almost like listening to an opera.  It was the conclusion of the story.  YotBR was the fine beginning to everything, and it even needed to sound and feel as if it was the raw turning point of this universe that was created.  I think they pulled it off, and I don't think a lot of people expected that.  Claudio has always been about execution.  He is all about the bigger picture.  If you really pay attention to the vocals, he even changes his vocal patterns and structure to convay a conversation between characters.  There is a methood behind his madness."

All tickets are will call so you can't even buy secondhand tickets in all honesty unless you find someone else who is going that had someone bail out. People that sell on StubHub are not going to meet you the day of. I also just checked my order of tickets and the tickets cannot be transferred either. Best bet for /u/saustintaylor1014 would be to find someone here, Twitter, or Facebook that's going that has extra tickets, but in all honesty I doubt he'll find anyone considering how tiny the venue is and how sought after tickets are."
TheFence,377t62,kapdragon,1 point,Mon May 25 20:44:49 2015 UTC,Is a 900 person venue really considered tiny? I was hoping to find cheaper tickets the day before like OP as well. I'm a newer fan so it's no big loss if I don't see them this time around. The tickets were originally $35 for this place so $100 is a really huge markup.
TheFence,377t62,SirNarwhal,1 point,Tue May 26 14:26:08 2015 UTC,"900 is definitely tiny and is the smallest venue they've played in years by a longshot hence why tickets were in high demand. And markup of about that much for smaller venues is pretty standard. If you wanted to go you should've used the quickness of the presale tickets selling out to know to jump on the general tickets in all honesty. Again though, since tickets cannot be transferred you're pretty much stuck looking for another fan willing to sell at cost value that's actually headed to the show as that'll be the only way you'll actually get in."
TheFence,377t62,kapdragon,1 point,Tue May 26 15:18:46 2015 UTC,"Right, unfortunately I'm such a new fan that I only found out about the concert two weeks ago, so way after presales were already over and sold out.

TheFence,377t62,SirNarwhal,1 point,Tue May 26 16:10:42 2015 UTC,"No problem! I mean, it's not impossible, just quite hard. If you're close enough that you can just hang out at the venue most of the day you'll probably find someone with an extra ticket to be able to get in."
TheFence,377t62,kapdragon,1 point,Tue May 26 16:12:43 2015 UTC,"Sadly it's a two hour drive for me, so no hanging out all day. Otherwise I totally would x3; I haven't been obsessed with a band like this for several years. I went 8 years never seeing my other favorite band in concert, so I can wait to see this band when they come around again. (Which is hopefully soon if they really do release another album this year.)"
TheFence,377t62,SirNarwhal,1 point,Tue May 26 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I'd actually say make the trek. They're playing a full concert for this (1 1/2 hours to 2 hours) and since it's NOT associated with an album release we'll get a good number of deep cuts that they haven't played in a while. Add in the tiny venue and it's seriously shaping up to be one of their best shows in a very long time."
TheFence,377t62,kapdragon,1 point,Tue May 26 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"I'll look into it. I do have work since it's a weekday, so I probably couldn't show up until closer to an hour or two before doors open. What's the best way to do something like this? Do people just go around the venue area asking if someone has extra tickets?"
TheFence,377t62,SirNarwhal,1 point,Tue May 26 18:35:42 2015 UTC,Pretty much. If you have a Twitter you can tweet with #Coheed or whatever too and someone may help; CotF on Twitter are super helpful.

TheFence,375ayh,chrysamere,2,Mon May 25 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"Yea it's a bit inherent that you aren't going to sound exactly like someone else. His style is over the top energetic drumming. He definitely wasn't going all out changing the drums filling every bar. He stuck to the parts josh wrote, just with small exceptions inherent to being an individual musician.   I highly doubt he pushed the band to do drum solos. They probably asked! And of course zach doesn't take bass solos. That's not really a thing.

That plus the fact that she is pregnant could be why it is called ""Random Reality Shifts"".

For instance, you could get the cover art from that album tattooed--it's great artwork.  Art just about always works better for a tattoo than text does. Talk to your artist, see what they think. See where their talents lie, and what styles of tattoos they are most proficient in. And, for the love of god, don't get it tattooed upside down.  Again, this is just my opinion on tattoos. What's most important is that you're happy with whatever you get. I'm very sorry to hear about your brother, and I hope that your tattoo turns out well!"

I was really hoping for a few in particular (Sentry, Domino, The Afterman, Gravity's Union), and I actually thought that they were going into Dark Side of Me when the drums started for Time Consumer.  Can't complain though.  I don't know if others at the show felt the same way, but it almost seemed like the show just sort of ended abruptly.  Welcome Home is their closer, but there were A LOT of people who were hanging around after that song, as if they expected a few more.  To put it in perspective, when I saw them in September on the Neverender tour, they played 19 songs; tonight they played 14.  I don't know if it was planned that way or if something happened mid show that had them cut the set short.  I know the show was listed as a warm up show, so they probably didn't wanna burn out too quickly, but it did seem like a pretty quick jump into Welcome Home (Claudio didn't even bring out hood double necked guitar!)."

TheFence,342mgp,ThisIsMyNewUserID,4,Mon Apr 27 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"There is no way it is more CLEAR than a digital version. LP will add some nuances to music, which some people find to be warmer and ""less artificial"" yet from a sound mastering perspective, records simply don't win that battle. I can understand the feeling of playing a record, heck even the more emotional attachment and ""oneness"" with the music, but especially today music is built digitally and will sound closer to the artist and producers vision on a digital medium.   Really, the best sound will come from high end audio (devices and speakers)."
TheFence,342mgp,scooby103,6,Mon Apr 27 22:21:41 2015 UTC,"What people are saying is that the vinyl is mastered differently from the digital versions (CD etc) - the process of mixing down the individual tracks that make up each song as recorded in the studio was done separately for the vinyl and the digital versions. It's quite possible that a ""better"" job was done for the vinyl version. If you had the same exact source material from an LP and a CD, the CD will be capable of providing superior sound quality to be sure. But if the source material on each is different (as in this case, different masters), then it really depends which mastering job was better."
TheFence,342mgp,PeanutNore,2,Tue Apr 28 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"To add a little to this, the process of mastering for vinyl is different because of the medium.  Vinyl cannot handle extreme low end frequencies as well as digital because of the physical nature of the needle contacting the record.  Bass below a certain frequency will cause the needle to jump the groove.  Now, I don't know specifically if a whole other master was done for vinyl or if the vinyl master is the same but with the very bottom rolled off, but from an eq perspective, rolling off the low end may result in a clearer record overall."
TheFence,342mgp,lethal909,3,Fri May 1 02:53:38 2015 UTC,Vinyl is actually pressed to disc with a non-linear frequency response which phono preamps have to correct for. The RIAA created and published an official specification for it and example preamp circuits used to restore flat EQ.
TheFence,342mgp,PeanutNore,1 point,Fri May 1 04:44:20 2015 UTC,"The other problem is that in this case the end product doesn't gel well with the sound the band is known for; production-wise, Chris understands Coheed's dynamic better than Atticus Ross did. If you listen to INKS or GA I especially, he gets how to make a drum and vocal-forward mix with more tertiary guitars sound pretty interesting, especially in a genre that's so prone to being overproduced and slick. INKS and GA I pack a lot of punch, but not because the guitars are the center, he lets them exist like they do on stage so everything feels very real and very different from a  typical rock album.  Atticus's production style suits electronic music and industrial stuff really well because he gets how to emphasize sounds, especially in the context of music; but that just shifts the focus too far away from Coheed's strong suits (songwriting, melody and some really fantastic drum work that are empowered by big-enough guitars and some really musical bass playing). Generally they sound better with a more ""Repeater"" by Fugazi sound than they do with a Nine Inch Nails or In Rainbows style production, so we get the sound of Atticus Ross injecting a lot of very different and interesting emphasis on elements of Coheed's sound that we aren't used to, like the distortion and synthesizers and drum samples. It doesn't work super well because they are very much a rock band, and it's only highlighted when you get the hyper-accurate sound of a CD rip. Obfuscate the end product with the limitations of vinyl and it helps massage the mix into being more what we like. I totally agree though, with the fact that most stuff is done in a DAW and produced almost exclusively digitally (even if some of the effects are analog/hardware based) the end result sounds best when delivered with as little medium interference as possible. If the album doesn't have a separate mix or master for vinyl then you basically just get a really shitty sounding version of the CD."

I've always kinda thought that it sounded like they were trying to feature Claudio's vocals more prominently and make him sound more ""mainstream"" so they turned his mic up, layered the crap out of his vocals, added some echoes, had him sing in a lower register and growl more than usual, and distorted the shit out of the guitars so their usual intricacies wouldn't distract the listener from the vocals.

TheFence,342mgp,lethal909,2,Mon Apr 27 22:30:43 2015 UTC,"I've addressed this before because I'm a super nerd about this stuff but it's like /u/PeanutNore and /u/lethal909 were saying; the mastering is very different for both mediums. The vinyl ones tend to have a bit more space because of the limited range a record has, whereas a CD with digital files can be full volume at Master, which gives you a lot less headroom than the vinyl version. Most times, the CD will just sound more ""immediate"" and ""big"" than the vinyl version of an album because it's got a wider range of frequencies, whereas the vinyl version will have the artifacts of the medium to contend with (lower volume, the issue with the non-linear pressing that gets corrected via preamp, pops and skips, etc.) that the CDs don't deal with. What we get is a CD version that sounds pretty normal volume-wise, but the mix is so fucking brickwalled and grindy that it sounds like it's at war with itself. The mix also was designed after an electronic/industrial production style that Atticus Ross is known for, which emphasizes noise (hence Travis's guitars just sounding like noise and the cymbals being not the clearest) and strange soudscapes over a more typical rock production like on Good Apollo (esp. Vol II, which is the most generic ""THIS IS A ROCK RECORD"" mix I've heard in a long while. Songs are great, but that mix is the big slick stuff built for radio. Vol I has some weird and fun stuff that keeps the space of older Coheed because Chris Bittner knows how to make this band sound fucking great in a mix). So you get a mix that sounds fuzzy and unfocused because it's centered around the instrumental passages and vocals in terms of writing but the production doesn't suit it. Put it on CD and it feels loud and confusing, putting it on vinyl gives it some distance so that when you listen to it it feels little more like a rock album and a little less like a wall of noise."

This sums up my experience with the record exactly in a way I wouldn't have been able to articulate before. The digital version sounds like a highly produced electronic music record with guitars, while the vinyl version sounds like a rock album with electronic elements."

TheFence,342mgp,PeanutNore,2,Fri May 1 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"For Coheed it's tough; unless you've got some serious change, a lot of them are hard/expensive to come by. Second Stage in particular is tough because it only had a few different pressings on the Neverender tour so they crop up on ebay. In Keeping Secrets had a wider release (and a remaster from last year that sounds pretty great, especially compared to the original vinyl pressing!), but GA I never got a full LP vinyl release and GA II is almost never found for under a hundred in most cases. It is on Amazon if you're into that though. I have the tour version of the INKS vinyl (the tan splatter/swirl) and if I recall correctly there are some minor defects in the pressing (repeat/skips on side B I think) so watch out there. There is a way to get the remastered mixes in a digital form as well if you want those so you can hear the difference without having to track down the vinyl.   Black Rainbow doesn't sound better on vinyl as a result of the medium, the vinyl master just sounds better for this kind of music, if that makes sense. I don't put the record on ever, but I do listen to that master of the album digitally almost exclusively now. If you're looking for the YOTBR vinyl master or the INKS vinyl master I might know a guy who knows a guy who has the files <.<   Being a band from the early aughts makes it tough because the vinyl revival thing hadn't caught on because while people weren't really buying CDs either, they certainly weren't buying vinyl records either. CD was the only economical option at the time, especially since it was their make-or-break kinda thing with GA I after INKS did pretty well chart wise."

I'd also recommend listening to Porcupine Tree, another excellent progressive rock band along the lines of Coheed and DT (listen to the albums Fear of a Blank Planet and Deadwing). The Dear Hunter, The Mars Volta, and A Perfect Circle are also very good progressive bands.   If you want to go on slightly different progressive routes, Muse, Opeth, Radiohead, and Tool are all great bands with some progressive elements."

Every DT album is unique tho so depending on ur tastes certain album(s) might peek your interest more than others

TheFence,32kinj,romanraspberrysorbet,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:11:43 2015 UTC,I intend to check them out.
TheFence,32kinj,eifersucht12a,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:14:45 2015 UTC,get started with this album. It's definitely their best I think.
TheFence,32kinj,romanraspberrysorbet,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:16:29 2015 UTC,Is anyone else getting an Armor For Sleep vibe from these guys? I'd never heard of them until this mini-tour was announced. I like em.
TheFence,32kinj,eastcoasternj,8,Wed Apr 15 13:46:57 2015 UTC,Hell yeah Toledo :)
TheFence,32kinj,Mattonicide,2,Tue Apr 14 16:37:33 2015 UTC,Hmmm yes. I might have to come up from Dayton for that one.
TheFence,32kinj,seedlesssoul,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:03:06 2015 UTC,The last time I saw them there was one of the best concerts I've ever been to
TheFence,32kinj,Berbaw06,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:23:42 2015 UTC,I went to BGSU so I'm hoping I still know some people in the area. Unfortunately I'm the only Coheed fan I know so I may end up going by myself. Totally willing for my first 'Heed show though :)
TheFence,32kinj,riceburner117,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:56:33 2015 UTC,Shows by yourself can be fun. Especially coheed shows. It's easy to talk people since everyone is nice and all shares the same interest :)

TheFence,32kinj,OboeHobo,4,Tue Apr 14 18:49:47 2015 UTC,I'll make the 15 minute walk to see Coheed in Kalamazoo
TheFence,32kinj,jkoss0972,2,Tue Apr 14 18:50:56 2015 UTC,"It's really strange to see that they'd play in my hometown.  It was a surprise when meWithoutYou played in Kzoo, but even more of one knowing that the 'Heed is going to be there.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to make it back there."
TheFence,32kinj,lookalive07,2,Tue Apr 14 19:07:17 2015 UTC,So psyched to see them here. Last saw them at the Orbit Room in GR before IKSSE:3. Sad to have missed the last tour but I'm pumped to see them in a place I could walk to.
TheFence,32kinj,Scattor20,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:14:43 2015 UTC,"Being as ive never been to district square, can you tell me anything about it? Will I need a ticket? If not, how early should I show up? Im not 100% sure on location, either...its that block down by Wild Bull and Monaco Bay, right?"
TheFence,32kinj,jkoss0972,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"I can't say I've ever been there myself, but I think I know the placement. From what I'm judging by pictures, it's definitely at that block by Monaco Bay. It's an outdoor venue, picture looks like it's actually in that street but I could be entirely wrong. A couple of friends have already picked up tickets through the pre-sale, so yeah you'll need a ticket. I usually show up to shows about twenty minutes before doors open. Don't show up right before the show itself starts if you wanna buy merch or get a decent spot.   All in all, some of your guesses are just as good as mine. Sorry, friend."
TheFence,32kinj,Scattor20,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:21:37 2015 UTC,How's the venue?
TheFence,32kinj,foxkilgannon,1 point,Wed Apr 15 02:58:24 2015 UTC,Ive actually never been..nobody has ever been there that I had any interest in seeing
TheFence,32kinj,jkoss0972,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:23:48 2015 UTC,"Its really small.  If the weather is good they'll play outside in the back.  Its ok, and I've always had fun there.  Get tickets as soon as they are available."

TheFence,32kinj,DeleriumTrigger,3,Tue Apr 14 20:44:56 2015 UTC,Well...they're playing in Orange County in a few weeks...But I agree I wish they would do an SF show.
TheFence,32kinj,stingrayship,2,Tue Apr 14 21:13:48 2015 UTC,Perfect. Driving distance from most of these shows.  Now if I can only come up with a decent excuse to blast out of work for a few days.......
TheFence,32kinj,ywgflyer,2,Tue Apr 14 15:54:21 2015 UTC,Going to a bunch of Coheed shows is not a good enough Excuse? What is wrong with this world!?

TheFence,32kinj,cakeslol,0,Wed Apr 15 19:42:41 2015 UTC,whats the set list though?
TheFence,32cwtt,BrapBattle,9,Sun Apr 12 19:04:44 2015 UTC,He's been using Fenders since Shabutie (mainly recording)  The odd guitar you're referring to is an Eastwood Airline 3 DLX. When it comes to recording and rehearsals he uses whatever he feels like. He used a Jazzmaster and Strat on GAIV so no surprise there.   They're recording in Nashville so I imagine he was using a studio tele that was the sane color so he went and got one for himself  EDIT: in the deleted post on instagram he did write he was using a tele custom deluxe on atlas. Don't expect a different guitar to change the song writing though
TheFence,32cwtt,VicTheButcher,3,Sun Apr 12 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"Huh I didnt realize he did much with fenders in the way of recording or anything. I always immedietly think its strange seeing him with something besides an explorer haha. That makes sense though, if he had been using one and liked it. I guess I thought of the Afterman and how he would use a strat or I think a LP exclusively for that song.   Completely unrelated, any idea if its standard for Deluxe Teles to have the traditional strat style headstock like that? That looks way better than the curvy weird one on most strats IMO."
TheFence,32cwtt,VicTheButcher,2,Sun Apr 12 19:28:04 2015 UTC,Yup! 70s was the CBS Era which had big headstocks.
TheFence,32cwtt,sasabomish,2,Sun Apr 12 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"Cool cool. I never been a huge fan of Teles, but the big headstock, and color of what Claudio got definitely looks pretty sweet."
TheFence,32cwtt,VicTheButcher,2,Sun Apr 12 19:56:25 2015 UTC,"just curious how do you know theyre recording in nashville, and do you know what studio?"
TheFence,32cwtt,sasabomish,4,Mon Apr 13 03:44:02 2015 UTC,"Don't know which studio, there was a post a few weeks ago that the whole band is in Nashville and will be for awhile. Chondra has been posting pics of the whole band going out in Nashville too  Couple that with the studio post that was deleted at Blaze's request and they're recording in Nashville. I believe they're working with a producer known for country too"
TheFence,32cwtt,VicTheButcher,2,Mon Apr 13 04:00:09 2015 UTC,well shit...i live 25 mins from nashville...howd i miss this? lol
TheFence,32cwtt,sasabomish,3,Mon Apr 13 04:03:41 2015 UTC,eh you gotta be pretty eagle eyed on their instagram accounts to pick it up. Some of us have nothing better to do than look into every damn thing Coheed does lol  But Blaze seems to be trying to keep the new album process secret as much as possible. Maybe it has something to do with him joining Rocnation. Maybe they're trying to pull a Beyonce/Taylor Swift and drop the album outta nowhere and avoid a leak like with Afterman
TheFence,32cwtt,VicTheButcher,2,Mon Apr 13 04:06:31 2015 UTC,"yeah, i've been slacking on that stuff. still a shame i didn't know about this since i work in the music industry. that seems very opposite of coheed to do, though i think fans would freak and love it at same time. just dont see how that method could be good for sales..."
TheFence,32cwtt,sasabomish,2,Mon Apr 13 04:09:31 2015 UTC,"Beyonce sold 617k copies of her self-titled within the first 3 days on itunes alone with no marketing at all, it was just there.  Not that Coheed has the same fanbase as Beyonce by any means, but Blaze now has a hell of a ton of connections and tools to make this happen.   Plus he wasn't super happy about the leaks last time (Which is why MANY people left Cobalt, since it is an official fan site Blaze set strict rules about leaks and the discussion of them)  But yeah tl;dr Blaze knows what he's about and we're gonna see awesome things now that he's with Rocnation"
TheFence,32cwtt,wolvesvane,2,Mon Apr 13 04:18:57 2015 UTC,"true, i guess when you have artists of that scale word spreads pretty damn quick. the albums have leaked since nwft as far as i know, and probably before that, that was just the first one i saw leaked."
