But then again, back then I would never have guessed you could win the Tour with a Japanese equipped, mass produced bike."

Bikeporn,3e0siv,mtranda,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:07 2015 UTC,Wish there was a colour version of this. The world wasn't black and white back in 1939.
Bikeporn,3e0siv,mtranda,5,Tue Jul 21 08:08:14 2015 UTC,"It wasn't?!? Haha just kidding.  Here is the quick back story, I had received a camera I had bought off eBay and was shooting a fresh roll of film that I had on hand. Went to the town north of the town that I live in. I had never been inside the bike shop up there and that day the door was open. So I went in and saw this beautiful red bike with near flawless chrome and wooden rims! The shop owner, Kent, told me the history of the bike and knew I had to grab a photo. So I did, made him a 12x12 print and gave him. I wrote a short history on the bike if you're interested."
Bikeporn,3e0siv,mtranda,5,Tue Jul 21 11:31:45 2015 UTC,"Ah! Hello, fellow film shooter! I was hoping there'd be a colour version of this.  I've grown used to  people shooting digital and desaturating for no good reason, just because they think ""b&w is art"". Picking a film and sticking with it is another story, though.  Also, yes, this bike's history sounds like a thrilling short read. She's a beauty.  P.S.: while the bike's colour may not be of much importance, I really wish the wooden rims stood out more. I'd have never guessed just by looking at the photo."

Boss owns/works at the shop, spends all their time working, no time for riding, but they have the sweet bike hanging up for all to see.  It's actually good for business in that it shows what level of components you can get/work with.  If all you've got hanging up in the ""nice bike"" section is a beat up commuter, yeah, I'm not going to look at you for buying high-end stuff."
Bikeporn,3dzkcf,blue01kat4me,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:40 2015 UTC,Two distinct shop owners are good friends of mine. They spend most of their time elbow-deep in the service area  People (not sure about OP) just seem to have no idea how stressful being a bike shop owner can be and have this idea the owners are rolling in dough and free time.
Bikeporn,3dzkcf,mtranda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:45:02 2015 UTC,"Being an owner of anything is fucking stressful. In the end, everything is your responsibility, and if you fuck up, everyone could lose their job. Depending on how emphatic/sociopathic you are, that can be a pretty heavy burden."

Bikeporn,3djgtm,MCHammer666,2,Fri Jul 17 02:24:49 2015 UTC,LOL!   Not quite. With proofhide it'll break in much faster. Or you can get the cambium seat which is already broken in. I have both and find cambium to be best when wearing riding shorts and leather best when riding casual clothes. I actually have 2 leather seats and my first took 2 years to break in. The second only took 7 months since I was riding a lot more. Both B17s
Bikeporn,3djgtm,ahongo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:25:24 2015 UTC,"Though they feel even better after some miles, the correct fitting brooks, properly adjusted, ought to feel fantastic from the first pedal stroke.

Bikeporn,3djgtm,falcongsr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"Good insights. I'm worried about selecting the right saddle for my needs, as I recently started riding a road bike and the saddle it came with is marginal at best. LBS has a vague sense of which saddle to recommend but I suspect they'd sell me a B17 just due to popularity when I might be better off on a B15/swift/swallow."

I have a 1964 JRJ which was absolutely  top end at the time. It's built up with mostly late 60's and early 70's stuff, with a few modern items, notably the rims and tires. It weighs about the same as this bike, even with the weight reductions of some of the modern parts. Of course he has tubular tires and that 24 spoke front wheel as well!

Bikeporn,3cpkzp,PLAAND,12,Thu Jul 9 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"It probably doesn't hurt that everyone else was riding similar bikes at the time.  It's apples and oranges but assuming that race lengths and difficulty have remained about the same, the (very rough) average winning time for an Under 23 Road World Champion since the year 2000 is about 4 hours and 23 minutes. Merckx won in '64 with a time of 4 hours and 39 minutes. So the dead average U23 world champion cyclist today (Even though that's nothing to sneeze at, this hypothetical rider is probably nowhere near the athlete that Merckx was) benefiting from 5 decades of marginal gains in equipment design and training science would (If we accept this totally unscientific model) likely beat Merckx by about 15 minutes. Obviously not all of this performance increase is the bike but one does wonder how fast Merckx could have been in '64 riding today's equipment.  ETA: I'd like to compare the 14 year average winning time surrounding Merckx's '64 victory to our hypothetical modern day champ but Wikipedia doesn't list amateur winning times except for Merckx in '64."
Bikeporn,3cpkzp,nexusheli,9,Thu Jul 9 20:38:54 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see the current athletes ride the older bikes and see how they fare.    That said, the bikes definitely did not make up that 15 minutes, and I would venture a guess the races were harder back in the day due to the lack of motorized support like they have today and generally the condition of the roads and how weather affected said roads."
Bikeporn,3cpkzp,docmuppet,5,Thu Jul 9 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"I agree but it's not only the bikes that have changed but the training, the food and also riding styles on top of better bikes."
Bikeporn,3cpkzp,daniel_ismyrealname,3,Thu Jul 9 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"Jan Heine and others at Bicycle Quarterly did some statistical analyses on the speed gains for cycling and found that of the 15 minutes or so difference you're seeing here, pretty much none of it is the bike. The percentage increases in speed for cycling lines up exactly for the percentage increases in speeds for runners, and there's no 'gear' for running that would make any real difference. It's not like shorts or shoes have changed in any meaningful way since the '50s. If runners have gained a couple % in speed due to nutrition and training since the '50s and so have cyclists, it's fairly reasonable to assume that those gains in cycling are not from the bike. Of course Trek and Specialized and whatnot have legions of marketeers bellowing about how much faster this model year is compared to last, but if that were true, then either cyclists have made no commensurate improvements in nutrition and training to match what runners have, or cycling would have seen a larger increase in speeds compared to running, but that's just not the case."
Bikeporn,3cpkzp,crosshogg,2,Fri Jul 10 00:26:07 2015 UTC,"Sallanches is in Haute-Savoie, the foothills of the Alps. I can't find a profile, but the course is described as ""treacherous"" and ""difficult"" in contemporary accounts. The Google satellite view is pretty daunting. My guess is it's pretty hard as World championship road courses go, so average winning times would have little relevance here.   I'm skeptical about the weight of the bike. Even for 1964, 25 lbs (11.4 Kg as Merckx claims) is heavy for a racing bike. The main culprits here would be the Brooks Professional saddle and the Campagnolo Record derailleurs, which were chrome-plated bronze (!). A comparable Peugeot PX-10 of the period would have tipped the scales at around 21.5 lbs for that 60cm frame size."

This setup is actually pretty good for the most part - assuming you're on pretty flat ground, you will stay in the big ring and have 5 gears to use, then 5 lower ones for a climb.  The occasional small hill could be hurdled just by dropping from the big to small ring.    On a 14-28, the main 5-speed combo still available today, the gears are incredibly spread apart and a lot of power is sapped because your main gears for racing are big+3rd or 4th.  5th isn't really achievable except on downhill, and the little ring isn't super useful at all either.

Bikeporn,3cc458,benlikesbikes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:48:34 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't the clear coat protect the steel from oxidation?

Bikeporn,3cc458,benlikesbikes,3,Tue Jul 7 12:33:44 2015 UTC,Unfortunately clearcoating bare metal doesn't work out the best. It has a problem adhering without paint or primer underneath and  usually fades or chips over time. I think you could probably get away with doing a clear Cerakote paint job on it though.   I wish I didn't have to cover it up at all! At least I will have these pictures.

Bikeporn,3c9c8l,balatico,8,Mon Jul 6 12:28:35 2015 UTC,"That's a beautiful bike.   Anyone who enjoys individually-crafted bicycles like this should check out the book The Golden Age of Handbuilt Bicycles, by Jan Heine. It features machines built by ""constructeurs,"" builders who often designed and fabricated components to integrate seamlessly with their custom frames.  Nice to see an Alex Singer on /r/bikeporn. Most submissions aren't really my style."
Bikeporn,3c9c8l,foxedendpapers,2,Mon Jul 6 05:16:22 2015 UTC,Do you have an estimate on the value of this beaut?
Bikeporn,3c9c8l,heechum,3,Mon Jul 6 05:30:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not really qualified to make estimates, but it's definitely worth a lot. An Alex Singer randonneuse recently listed on eBay is at $5600 right now. Alex Singers are probably second only to Rene Herse bicycles in desirability among collectors of vintage French bikes.  The bike in OP's pictures is missing a lot of the original equipment -- most obviously the fenders -- that drive up price, and it looks like a much more recent build, so it loses some of the nostalgia value. It's in really nice shape, though.   I would guess it would sell for $3500 pretty easily as-is. It would be worth looking into replacements for some of those missing parts.   If I'd come across that bike, the first thing I'd do would be to get in touch with Jan Heine. He's the expert.  Edit: the thing I thought was a fender bracket looks to be an attachment to wipe debris off the tire, per /u/pernod."

The Crane GS (http://www.disraeligears.co.uk/Site/Shimano_Crane_GS_derailleur_(DR-102).html) suggests it's a 70s bike, though, so it's a clue!  It's got a Campy headset as well, and the tubing is English. There's no mishmash like a top-of-the-line mishmash."

Bikeporn,3c9c8l,bpwnz,2,Mon Jul 6 13:14:12 2015 UTC,"The Jubilee front is an okay derailleur. I retired mine in favor of a Campy Record, which works much better even on a triple. The second or third generation Dura Ace is probably the best choice. Stay away from the first gen Dura Ace. the cage is too narrow to work well. The Crane rear is excellent until it wears out and gets sloppy. Keep it clean and lubed."
Bikeporn,3c9c8l,bublet,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:51:29 2015 UTC,thanks for the feedback! I haven't decided exactly how wide of a gear range I can run in the back. Will the crane support 7spd?
Bikeporn,3c9c8l,bpwnz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:09:57 2015 UTC,No problem there. I run wide Dura Ace 6 speeds because I have a few old Dura Ace chains that ran $75 each back in the day.

Bikeporn,3bvcwf,themontajew,4,Thu Jul 2 15:32:31 2015 UTC,"I'm trying really hard to figure out how a low maintenance, IGH bike with tons of carrying capacity, capable of traversing nearly any terrain is the worst bike for the job...   If you're doing a Trek Leisure Tour and have a box truck following you and stopping for wine tastings along the way, yes, this isn't your best choice."
Bikeporn,3bvcwf,themontajew,0,Thu Jul 2 15:41:07 2015 UTC,"Well you could use a 29er and get anywhere with less weight and less work on a tire that rolls better.  This whole fat bike + size thing is absolutely stupid, unless you're going to Alaska or the beach they are a waste of effort an energy. Want a wider tire to give you some cushion? That's what suspensipn is for, and it works really well without your tires wondering around under you from low pressure.   The thing about 26x3.0 tires is us downhillers tried it in like 2000 from nokian. They didn't really hook up any better (fun fact is when you look at frictional forces in physics the contact patch is actually irrelivant) as a 2.5 gives you all the bite you need and actually does better getting through loose stuff instead of floating on it, and they are bloody heavy to get tires that wide. We learned our lesson and know that a super wide tire actually tends to just ride like shit, and we use a chairlift to get to the top"
Bikeporn,3bvcwf,themontajew,3,Thu Jul 2 15:55:50 2015 UTC,"Your argument may have been valid in 2000 (15 years ago), but the proliferation of wider, lighter rims, tire options, tubeless-ready rims/tires, etc. has negated most of your argument.   Also, we're talking rigid touring bikes here, not full suspension downhill bikes. When it comes to remote touring over mixed terrain, a little cushion is nice and a 3"" tire at lower pressure goes a long way in taking the edge off.  Most bikepackers and expedition level cyclists (including much of field of the Divide ride) are running ""plus"" setups, and posting record breaking times (though with non-competitive touring, record breaking isn't really the goal).   https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3073/2767638386_d8efc6fb1f.jpg"

Bikeporn,3bwib6,Boldsmith,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:23:45 2015 UTC,"Oh hello, I didn't see you there. I just built this sucker up. I found the frame last winter on ebay and built it up with 105. Someone asked my why I went with such a cheap group, but to be honest 105 is really nice, and I'm more interested in the ride feel than the bling when it come to the components. Maybe I'll upgrade it eventually, but my priority was getting this bike ready for the Seattle to Portland ride next week.  Here is a gallery: http://imgur.com/a/UoY0k"

Bikeporn,3bj8yb,Redcorns,14,Mon Jun 29 18:17:03 2015 UTC,That's the Cannondale Si crankset. 36/52 tooth.
Bikeporn,3bj8yb,senoritaoscar,5,Mon Jun 29 18:36:24 2015 UTC,Because Cannondale is far too attached to BB30.
Bikeporn,3bj8yb,D0rk4L,2,Mon Jun 29 18:18:16 2015 UTC,"In the past, Cannondale used FSA rings on the Si Cranks for the higher spec'd CAADs, reserving their in-house SpiderRing chainring/spider combo on high end SuperSix's and such. Looks great, but in practice (on my CAAD10), it makes a lot of noise over time (Both from the frame/bearing interface and the spiderring/crank interface) requiring frequent service and re-greasing. When it is smoothly running though, it's light, strong, and beautiful looking."
Bikeporn,3bj8yb,senoritaoscar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"I've got this particular setup, and yeah, the rings are really noisy. I'm going to go with Sram Red rings next season as the first upgrade."

Bikeporn,3bd0zh,Kelly9er9er,3,Sun Jun 28 01:40:36 2015 UTC,How much clearance is left on that rear tire? Looks like a dusty road would keep that wheel from turning
Bikeporn,3bd0zh,Llama_In_Hiding,3,Sun Jun 28 06:37:06 2015 UTC,"IIRC, UCI regulations state they have to be able to fit a credit card between the wheel and the seat tube. Also because its a track bike its unlikely you would be riding on a dusty road"
Bikeporn,3bd0zh,TomGun212,2,Sun Jun 28 12:08:24 2015 UTC,It won't be used as a track bike. The chain has been cut too short to allow gear changes. It's a road fixie.
Bikeporn,3bd0zh,banchad,-2,Sat Jul 4 09:53:42 2015 UTC,"Track bikes only have one gear, Its meant to be on an indoor velodrome. It also has horizontal dropouts so it would never be designed to have a derailleur in order to change gears"
Bikeporn,3bd0zh,TomGun212,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:16:31 2015 UTC,Proper track bikes have extra chain to allow the sprocket and chain ring to be changed to different ratios for different events. This bike will never change ratio unless the chain is changed. I am a track rider. I know this shit.
Bikeporn,3bd0zh,banchad,2,Sat Jul 4 10:19:13 2015 UTC,"I also ride on a track, you should know that its not entirely difficult to change ratio, and at most have a spare chain and drive chain if you know you are going to want to change ratio at an event. My current set up has a short chain on a ratio I am comfortable with, but if I want to change ration, ill take the chain and cog off, and swap them around. Either way I was originally commenting to explain why this track bike has such a tight clearance between the rear wheel and seat tube, but we both know that this bike looks as if it was designed and built up to be ridden on a track, but will inevitably be ridden on the street as shown in the photo. Just because its not being ridden as a track bike doesn't mean its not a track bike"

Bikeporn,3atbew,FalseBuddha,2,Tue Jun 23 20:39:13 2015 UTC,From what I understand a lot of team mechanics already spend a ridiculous amount of time setting bikes up for races (most 'A' riders have 5-6 bikes race ready) not to mention the amount of time they spend rebuilding bikes overnight.
Bikeporn,3atbew,boom_shoes,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:06:43 2015 UTC,"Just because rebuilding/rerouting this bike requires significantly more time (it's only my assumption, but I believe it's true) compared to Tarmac or Venge for example."

But I'm sure I'll start to like it as I get used to seeing such departures from traditional bike design. Interesting to see the new ultra-aero Madone and Venge come out at the same time. When Trek and Specialized go head-to-head with their plentiful resources, everyone wins."

Bikeporn,3atbew,Sinasis,8,Tue Jun 23 15:29:19 2015 UTC,"It's not. The 5 minute claim is a conglomeration of savings gained from the use of the bike, wheels, skinsuit, helmet, and shoes. Plus, it's 5 minutes saved against their non-aero Tarmac frame, not over every other aero frame in the peloton."
Bikeporn,3atbew,stravadarius,2,Tue Jun 23 16:29:03 2015 UTC,"They definitely slipped that one in over my head for a second.

Just moved to a new place where I'll be doing a lot more of both so it just felt right. I got excellent deals on everything so it was far less than I originally budgeted.
Bikeporn,3asbys,6rant,2,Tue Jun 23 10:08:45 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, you asked about advice for your build on /r/bikewrench right? Glad to see it came out so nicely! I'm just a bit jealous- that's a great looking frame especially."
Bikeporn,3asbys,_evergrn,2,Tue Jun 23 07:13:56 2015 UTC,I sure did! this this is what the bike looked like when I got it. I also threw in a pic of my other Bianchi so you can see how huge of an upgrade this is for me.
Bikeporn,3asbys,_evergrn,2,Tue Jun 23 10:13:41 2015 UTC,Quite a big leap indeed! TBH I wouldn't mind your previous ride either. Looks like quite a nice everyday ride.
Bikeporn,3asbys,weekendofsound,2,Tue Jun 23 11:15:48 2015 UTC,It certainly is! My old bike was considered a decent bike in its day and its fast enough to keep up with most of my friends. The biggest improvements Im already seeing are the braking and shifting. Indexed shifting is a marvelous thing.  I plan on selling a lot of the take offs from the Bianchi to fund an overhaul on the steel frame. I'd like to build it into a long distance touring bike I can take camping. I already have a rack and some bags to put on it.
Bikeporn,3asbys,pjblurton,2,Tue Jun 23 12:56:20 2015 UTC,Porn pics need no saddle and top tube bags.    Frame looks super nice however.    Vaping is ridiculous.

I was talking to a tech at my LBS the other day and he said a guy brought in a wheelset that he got custom made by Ferrari.  I think he said it cost the guy ~10k for the wheelset alone, bike came to around 25k.  Cant ever imagine spending that much on a bike... but i guess if i just had it lying around..."
Bikeporn,3aub2n,themontajew,3,Tue Jun 23 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"Even at 8-10,000$ Im not going to want some of the parts the MFG specced, they have things like ""do we even buy shit from them"" to think about.  Yeah, I did a 23,000$ dogma for a guy, then he called a week later needing 6,000$ in tools, fit stuff, and kits for all weather. A week after that 3 more of the same for his other houses, then came the 4 time ""fixes"" that were well over 10,000$ (they were Olympic class track bikes, not fixies) then the hardtail, and 2 different full suspension bikes. It was well over 300,000$ in fucking bicycles in less than 2 months. Absolutely insain"
