It would make them bad consumers
NoFap,3e2smd,Neutrocker,4,Tue Jul 21 16:25:56 2015 UTC,"Indeed, it is all about money.  Not only is the pornography industry itself alone worth billions of dollars, it also spills into other businesses. If you're not able to control yourself sexually, you're also less likely to control yourself when it comes to other things (food, impulsive spending, etc) and those other industries thrive off of your inability to control yourself.  A society without restraint is a profitable one for those providing the services and products. I don't want to sound like some conspiracy theorist, but ""they"" don't want you to be disciplined. ""They"" being the government, heads of major corporations, etc."

I mean, if you are shaky then whats there to you, more than likely you will connect with another shaky person and that might just be shooting yourself in the foot.

I've been hit on by many girls in my life but have never flirted back because I didn't want to lead girls on for nothing.

We re a dopamine making machine... and that it's equally frightening to the rational thought as it is to behaviour -> feelings"

NoFap,3e2hsm,Harry216,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:39 2015 UTC,I think that the two biggest and most evident ones are actually confidence being gained from being able to control your impulses and the benefits of just using your time in better ways. I would advise against going into this expecting more then that but those two things can have a big ripple effect.   Stay busy and use that energy for positive things.

As long as you don’t make it super creepy. This is one aspect about NoFap that I think makes people a little confused and cult like. It’s okay to look at another woman!!! I do have a suggestion and that is to make your goal 90 days. 40 days is really just the beginning of the gold. It usually took me about 60-70 days to really start feeling astronomical benefits. I usually relapse around 90 days, so I would try and keep it going longer, which is my next goal."

NoFap,3dydi6,Lurban,10,Mon Jul 20 22:49:50 2015 UTC,"You...do not know... The struggle is...as we say here on the internet...reals feels bruh seriously, first world problems, but the fact that we are dealing with it is the testament. Fact is, we could be busier, but we aren't. We have this bountiful leisure time, we have this technology, we have our intellect, but it's the discipline we lack.   Can't just go into the military to get it without risking all kinds of things, mostly PTSD I'd say, even then, there's no guarantee. I know plenty of vets who act like children.  No, we have to take this into our own hands.   If you don't understand, what brought you here, might I ask? (not to be rude or anything, you don't seem like a troll)  This is it though, with control over this situation, we find control over the majority of the rest of our lives. This is truly one of the most relevant challenges we face in society. Sex is marketed, and we are the target. Once we are in the cross hairs...we are slaves not just to our own uncontrollable urges but to buying what we're being sold, all around. Cigarettes, beer, lies... women who don't love us, some men probably.   Really and truly, I believe it's a matter of our biology and physiology mixing with the technology...there is an awesome youtube video linked on the sidebar which speaks at length about the effects the images and particularly novel images have on our dopomine production. I've been doing NoFap for months now. I've relapsed, failed, whatever you want to call it. I've been preaching. I've told friends about it. Talked to so many.   It's truly life-changing dude. I saw my first porn when I was like 13. I'm 27 now. I've had girlfriends complain to me about my porn consumption, and I always thought they were the problem and weren't open-minded enough. Now, I'm so glad things have worked out the way they have. The last thing I want is to need to look at disgusting images just to get it up for the rest of my life because that's what it was getting to without me even realizing it. I found it exciting.  Now, dude. you don't even want to know. It will make you jealous.  I have all my ex's (except one admittedly who is set to get married and I just want for her to be happy, I will always be here for her, and I will be ready if she needs me) calling me, new women left and right, married .that's right, I said fucking married women I know, hitting me up, wanting to hang out, telling me they're swingers. I have confidence, the job I've always wanted, I quit smoking cigarettes and was able to willingly quit smoking pot for months cold turkey. I still have room to improve, but I would not be here were it not for NoFap.  I would also recommend the Upvoted Podcast episode that interviews the founder of this sub.  Seriously, I hope it's as easy for you as I just read it because man, some of us truly, truly struggle. Lives can be destroyed. We are the keepers here, brother. We aren't doing a good job though. The world's in shambles, we still have slavery onthis planet, sex slaves. It's not cool. Only we can solve this problem, ain't a single damn person gonna solve it for us. If you have the strength, please, preach it. Enlighten us. It's not just the touching of the junk, I promise. It's society, it's clothing women wear, it's personal health and responsibility, it's the internet, it's who we are and who we intend to be. It's not very simple....to most of us. You are blessed"

NoFap,3e0ggl,itzmylife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:14:51 2015 UTC,My longest streak was 9 months. But I failed because of getting intimate with my GF on the phone. So I can say I didn't dig my way there but it just happened but I could have guarded myself as well. So I guess it's 50% digging and 50% circumstance.

NoFap,3e0ggl,kazarbreak,4,Tue Jul 21 02:44:51 2015 UTC,Go outside. Do something active. Preferably with other people. Don't just sit and try fighting it off with willpower.

I also almost relapsed a few times but closed the browser before anything bad loaded.  I guess for everyone it's different."
NoFap,3e0ggl,AmazingNoFapMan,4,Tue Jul 21 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"WHAT?! HOW?!  My streak was a smooth cruise until around day 35. So, I thought after 30-35 days, I was completely cured. I didn't even think about fapping anymore. I even started having normal sex dreams and not dreams of me sitting in front of the computer PMO-ing. But at day 35-36, I woke up feeling like I got an adrenaline shot right into my privates. And ever since every day is the same; I have blue balls, and I am doing WHATEVER I CAN just not to relapse. Seriously, I didn't even know someone can get so horny. It's like my soldier is doing jumping jacks on his own, without me controlling it. It's horrible, I can't even sleep at night, the past 5 days I've only been getting 2-4 hours of sleep because of my urges, and the worst part is I feel SO energetic, not sleepy at all, that I could defy gravity and run around on the ceiling.   I almost relapsed 2-3 times, but I closed the browser before any images or videos loaded. If I were you, I'd prepare for this urge storm.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! BRACE YOURSELF!"
NoFap,3e0ggl,AmazingNoFapMan,2,Tue Jul 21 04:23:09 2015 UTC,Same here. The first month of my longest streak was actually pretty easy. Maybe did it lead me to relax my vigilance because I then had trouble staying strong and ended relapsing on day 37.  Never let your guard down guys !

But you might have had a heavier addiction than me, since I only relapsed a couple of times in the past few months. And as a result you might need more time to get to some healing stage, as I view this urge storm."

Then I did a few hundred more of different push-up variations. I did around 50-60 dumbell curls. I did as much as weighted sit ups and squats as I could.  I worked out until I genuinely couldn't work out anymore. And I collapsed and spread myself over the floor with my face turning to the ceiling; and there he was. My soldier giving me his salutations, standing upright as ever like it didn't even bother him.  All of my usual tricks that worked didn't all of the sudden.  Man, I even relapsed today and my urge is still going strong, giving my best not to do it a second time today. What the hell is happening!"

""Let's go to the nude beach, it's natural"", ""Let's check the photos of that girl on Facebook, it's just a customer"", ""Why not walk around naked this afternoon, it's so hot here"".

I had a gf for about a year now and we used to have sex mutliple times a day for most of the time until a few weeks before it ended.  I just can't make it happen again. I don't know people to go party with and I don't really know where to meet girls that are ready for a one night stand.

Wet dreams like any other dreams are something your mind does in it's self-conscious. So you don't have any control over it.

Usually i spend most of my spare time on Grindr or jackd or one of those other hookup sites. i THOUGHT i was living it up (having sex with random dudes) but all it does is eat away at your soul. And i thought (like every other gay guy) i was attracted to certain type of guys but now that i dont watch porn (never been much into tv either) my taste in men has changed. Somehow guys who over groom appear plastic to me...like i dont know how to explain it. and believe me i used to be one of those over groomers myself. Now i am turned on by guys with natural scent ( and no i dont mean sweaty) and average-clean looking guys. Now i know why i regret every hookup after i orgasm. Usually,for me, it gets awkward after sex with random hookups..even fuck buds. some like to cuddle and talk after but the only thing on my mind is ""get the fuck out of here"". And honestly being gay and given the ubiquitous nature of horny men, sex was a major priority in my life. I spent every waking hour of my past two years seeking sex online with different dudes every time. Now i am exploring other hobbies such as reading, drawing, going out and even started volunteering with the red cross and the National alliance on mental illness (NAMI). I promise you once you start this ""new life"" you might not want to go back to that stressful existence. I know i dont. GOOD luck to you my friend!!!"

Don't get discouraged if you didn't reach 10 days, reaching 9 days is already a feat. Don't compare yourself with the monks in NoFap our progress may be slow but we are getting there. My happiest life was when I got a streak of 270 days and just looking back to those times drives me to strive even harder. No I can't say this journey is easy and failing at times is understandable. But I still try not to because of the benefits I had when I had the streak and that drives me to go back to it. NoFap might be pseudo science for some but I don't care, I've experienced it and the benefits could be endless and it's subjective for most fapstronauts. Nevertheless there are real benefits and that's what I hold on to."

I know my case might not have been as bad as yours (it's pointless to try and compare individuals' experiences), but I'd say if you really want it, you can make it happen.

Such as, How many times did you relapse per week/month ? If you end your streak every 4-5 days, you still have a pretty good ratio of the times you relapsed to number of days you didn't.  I end up every 5-7 days ( Sometimes 10 days ) but that doesn't mean I'm not improving myself, I'm just stumbling around going at the right path. This should be your thinking bro !

I have a feeling that NoFap would be positive change for you but it's tough: it's tough for all of us man.  I'm in nearly the same boat as you - I've known about nofap since 2011 and my longest nofap streak is 13 days. Seriously! Some months I wouldn't actually try but when I did I'd get to maybe a week and that's it. I've went ""easy mode"" and got to a month+ twice but eventually started it back up again. This time (ha) I want to succeed and over the past month I've been improving slowly.   Everything in life is connected - if you quit on this when it's tough, what's stopping you from quitting on something else that is just as tough?"

I am much happier striving and continually failing at getting a long streak than I was before doing nofap...when I used to PMO sometimes 6ish times a day. I forgot the warmth of the sun, the feel of the wind, the laughter of real women...all I had was the screen and my harem of jpgs/videos myyyy preciousss.  I'd rather be a mediocre nofapper than a PMO master.  It stopped feeling good. PMO was no longer satisfying, I had reached the end of the road. It leads to a dark place of compulsion and an utter lack of satisfaction or enjoyment. At the end of that road, PMO doesn't even feel good any more. The O part felt like nothing, and I felt like crap all the time. I didn't even feel guilty, I had embraced PMO and become a disciple on the path to PMO mastery.  That path leads to unhappiness. The damage accumulates. Today you say you don't have it in you to strive any longer. Continuing down the path of PMO could lead to you not having it in you any more to strive for much of anything.  Even if we never reach the destination, the journey is worth it. PMO feels a lot better when doing nofap than after a few months of doing it every day.  Maybe rethink it: Can I be bothered to quit nofap? and is quitting worth making all my PMO sessions far less enjoyable than they are right now."

In fact, you'll be a happier early 20 something if you look back and don't have a lot of girlstuff that happened. (that's the part you don't believe me on...)  Just keep your dick in your pants and enjoy life.  If you REALLY want to be a dating hero, TAKE GIRLS ON DATES.  Movies.  Dinner.  Ice Cream.  GO OUT AND HAVE FUN AS PEOPLE.  Don't get in their pants.  Girls are way way more awkward about sex than boys.  Enjoy them for just being your friends and people.  Don't let sex and kissing get all messed up in the mix."

If she is as good a person as you describe and if she genuinely cares about you, then she will be supportive and show understanding.  b. if talking about no fap and ed is too much then skip those parts and just tell her you have a lot on your mind and go easy on the sex for a bit, a short streak of 30 days should be enough for you to be functional and get your confidence back.  Hope that helps."
NoFap,3e1sto,HybridTyrant,2,Tue Jul 21 11:20:27 2015 UTC,"Awesome advice, thank you. I am just going to take it slow and see if the 30 days can clear my mind up like you said. I'll also just calm myself down when I see her now, and just worry about that last, not put it on the forefront of my mind. My set goal is 90 days, then I'll just keep going from there. Thank you so much again for the advice and for reading it."

NoFap,3e1xqp,ToBecomePure,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:29:30 2015 UTC,"Way to go man, sounds like great progress already. I believe the best way to eliminate a habit like this one is to rely on pure willpower as little as possible, since that eventually will fail. My one piece of advice, therefore, is to consider going somewhere during the evenings like a coffee shop and studying there. You can stay there, study and watch your show, and once you're tired or your battery runs out head home and crash. Being in a public space will mean you won't have to rely as much on willpower to avoid opening up those sites, because now you've gone out of your way to a public area where it would not go unnoticed. You don't even have to do this every night, just when you're feeling really tempted. Hope this helps a bit, keep up the good work!"

NoFap,3e2eei,king-ratte,2,Tue Jul 21 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"I feel you, I still never had a girl friend and I'm 21 and I could care less because I am currently focusing on me. When I constantly relapse I find myself being in a ""regretting, angry, depressed"" mind set in which I feel like doing nothing. However on nofap I am doing things I wouldn't normally do such as exercising, going out with friends, being more social, and spending a lot of money on food etc...which I really hate doing.Only difference is you've replaced nofap, with other things such as drugs, and alcohol. Which I am not saying is bad, but all in moderation.   Like on noFap, when you go to the club, drink, do drugs it may feel like impulse decisions to refrain form PMOing, however I recommend to try choosing other activities that will have a more positive effect on your mind and health.   We both have excessive lifestyles in which we get fully immersed because we want to get away from PMO, however try doing newer and better activities. The problem becomes when you realize you ""need"" to drink or get high etc. then that is addictive behavior and if that is the case, yes you should attempt to get therapy and seek professional help, in proper ways of managing that."

Now those are feels.  It's not sunshine and puppies, in fact it's a helluva lot of pain, but when you make it through, you'll have a clarity you've never felt before...it'll make your current state seem like brain fog.  Keep going brother, the climb is worth it!"

I haven't been diagnosed, but I am fairly certain I have body dysmorphic disorder, which leads to a lot of anxiety when I am around people. I am hoping nofap will alleviate this :)"
NoFap,3dzeg1,OnNahuatl,2,Tue Jul 21 01:26:32 2015 UTC,"One thing I think a lot of people don't discuss is the way porn decreases your overall awareness.  Some people are just born with awareness of their potential and their emotions, or at least, gain it quicker then others.    I wonder if I hadn't gotten into porn and fapping at a young age if I would have had a higher amount of awareness when I was younger.    The key here is to not let your long period of PMO get you down.  Understand that you enjoyed your life so far either way and that if you quit now it will be better.  End rant"
NoFap,3dzeg1,OGsimpsonRGdub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:55 2015 UTC,"You definitely make a good point. PMO really does a number on your psyche (and body after a while), and when you get into it at a young age, like myself, it just kinda creeps into your life and grows into a juggernaut. In addition to this, I had some other addiction issues that perpetuated for a number of years.   The way I look at it is that, knowing now, is better than realizing even farther down the road, when you've lost even more time. There is some regret, but the fact remains that I still have some life left to enjoy. Even though I missed out on those years, I'm better now and getting better still and I get to see things with fresh eyes.   Plus, I'm not really ""stopping"", but am making better, more fulfilling decisions that serve me better now and in the long run. The longer you stay on the path, the better you'll feel. It's like they say, life sucks, but it sucks worse if you're living in your addiction.  Sorry if that sounded preachy, I'm working on it. XD"
NoFap,3dzeg1,MsAmelie,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:12 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to share that. If you have problems with relapses, it isn't because you're weak, but it's because you need to exercise the ""good decision making"" portion of your brain and psyche that has atrophied from all that self abuse.   Very well put. And 30 days IS impressive."
NoFap,3dzeg1,mcmackie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:43:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks. It's all about focus and replacing bad decisions with better ones. And also, I wouldn't have made it this far on my own.

NoFap,3e363a,MarquisNoFap,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think that somehow the sexual area in your brain is somehow linked to the self-defense one or something, thus you feel sexual pleasure out of inflicting pain.  With all due respect, you are an addict, you have to reboot your brain all the way, not PMOing for 90 days according to some people.  I highly suggest you go here and read the FAQ : http://yourbrainonporn.com"
NoFap,3e363a,solidus001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:24 2015 UTC,Can you really reboot pathways that have been there since birth/early-childhood? I always imagined they were set in stone. Just like how you can't change someones sexual orientation.

NoFap,3e363a,bigballsomar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"I think you are trying to rationalise why you can watch porn once or twice a week which would be a complete contradiction of what no fap is.   Even if you take out the sadism element: people watch porn where 5 guys cream over a girls face, 2 well endowed guys do dp on a slight female and people take enormous dildos. But 99% of guys don't go around having that kind of sex in real life.   I would say cut out any form of porn and review after 90 days. What is the point of watching this stuff and not wanking- it's not gonna work friend.   Apologies if this is triggering."
NoFap,3e363a,bigballsomar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:22 2015 UTC,It's not triggering. Thanks for the help!  The point of watching it without wanking is that I get sexually satisfied without the physical stimulus. This might however just be my brain getting it's porn fix.  Probably just gonna go for 90 days and see how it changes me.  Best case scenario: Sadism is gone  Worst case scenario: Sadism is still there in a more pure form. Not affected by porn. In which case I'll just find friendly litte masochist.
