Multicopter,3e31po,tinkertron5000,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:19 2015 UTC,"Looks good!  I'd be a bit concerned that the motor wires would get caught up in the props.  I also read recently that mounting the motors are far up in the mounts as possible increases thrust by up to 15%.  Not sure if that's true or not, but is probably worth playing around with."
Multicopter,3e31po,sadkins1981,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting! I'll have to try that. I've been kinda using the LEDs to hold the motor wires down, but yeah, I should get some rubber bands on there to keep them out of the way."
Multicopter,3e31po,inquartata,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:34 2015 UTC,Stupid question probably but do you use the hubsan controller or can another (better) controller be used?
Multicopter,3e31po,inquartata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"I did use the Hubsan. I've seen some other posts where they mounted it upside down, but I didn't do that. I'm sure you could use an AlienWii or Beef's Brushed on there. I'd recommend something with the ESCs/FET built in though. It's very light! I also had to re calibrate my ""level"" after getting everything put together. You just hold the left stick (throttle/rudder) to the bottom left after it's bound to the quad and the move the right stick (pitch/roll) back and forth until the LEDs blink. That fixed my only real issue after getting this built."
Multicopter,3e31po,LOOKITSADAM,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:11 2015 UTC,I have actually been thinking about buying a hubsan FC for my microquad build since the AlienWii is so far off in the future... But I guess then you have to use the Hubsan transmitter to control it? I really would like to avoid using another transmitter. :T
Multicopter,3e31po,Xvoliose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:20 2015 UTC,Theoretically it's possible to rig up something like a afro mini FC to drive brushed motors with some extra 'fets... might be worth looking into.
Multicopter,3e31po,Thegreensgoblin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:39 2015 UTC,"I'm flying it with some bigger batteries and a couple of the standard size batteries. It flies longer with the big ones, but better with the small ones."
Multicopter,3e25th,bexamous,3,Tue Jul 21 11:20:12 2015 UTC,When flying LOS like this are you using the prop colors for orientation at all?
Multicopter,3e25th,chronitale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:24:29 2015 UTC,"Not consciously at all.  Maybe unconsciously when up close its something for your brain to help key off a bit, espeically if you're just like hovering and not moving...  but any time you're moving its much easier to see that than colors, both up close or further out."
Multicopter,3e25th,chronitale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:17 2015 UTC,Then I may change all of mine to same color for a while. I notice I keep concentrating hard on what color my props are instead of just watching my quad.
Multicopter,3e25th,Bro_man,2,Tue Jul 21 21:49:15 2015 UTC,What kind of setup / AUW are these things? I love the agility.
Multicopter,3e25th,LOOKITSADAM,2,Tue Jul 21 12:24:43 2015 UTC,It's probably one of these: http://www.warpquad.com/  The thrust:weight ratio is usually somewhere around 9-10:1  e: another video: https://vimeo.com/86291282
Multicopter,3e25th,Bro_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:23 2015 UTC,"9-10:1, good lord.  I'm having trouble keeping my 250 sized quad oriented, I can't imagine how you keep front from back on those things. Very impressive though."
Multicopter,3e25th,Bro_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:05 2015 UTC,"I got two of these things, this isn't the one I was flying but its basically the same: http://i.imgur.com/aeMt416.jpg  The one I was flying, 209 grams w/o battery, 2204/2300kv, 6045 props, KISS ESCs, Dodo FC, D4RII receiver.. and either 1000mah 3s or 4s Nanotech... not sure which in video, I wasn't using lots of throttle-- CA has no water because they overwater that field all the time, its squishy when you walk around.

Multicopter,3e2fow,backwoods_neckbeard,3,Tue Jul 21 13:05:47 2015 UTC,"I am running Cobra 2204 2300kv on 4S with KISS 18A ESCs and HQ 5x45 Bullnose props and it is a machine! Btw FinalGlideAUS flies the same setup (only he got the KISS 30A prototypes from flyduino for testing, that bastard) and won the US Drone Nationals race AND freestyle, just sayin...  Here is a video of me flying that setup:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ2dXhVs9YQ  And here is what FinalGlideAus does with it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6CyL6x66r8  I hear that those new Cobra 2206 2100kv are beasts too though, so if you want to go for 6x45 props then those are probably a good choice too!"
Multicopter,3e2fow,ErrorAsh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"hahah, well, the beauty of the nucleus is that if i ever decide to upgrade that 3s to a 4s build, all i need to do is resolder a few connections, add a battery and escs, and i'm done! i really like the 5045 props, and i have a bunch of them, so maybe once i get the 4s build done i'll convert the 3s.  then i can have a 5 inch and a 6 inch setup but the same power plant."
Multicopter,3e2fow,ErrorAsh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:24 2015 UTC,I am running the Nucleus too. If you have a VTX and FPV cam that can take 4S voltage then you don't need to resolder anything at all. I can switch between them seemlessly...
Multicopter,3e2fow,ErrorAsh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:20 2015 UTC,"camera is 12v not too sure about the vtx.  i have a lumineer 600mw and a ft592 200mw.  i thought there was one or two other places you had to check for 4s on, but im probably wrong.  i never thought to just hook up the camera to the 4s pad on a 3s system.  for some reason i thought that would be bad lol"
Multicopter,3e2fow,BeeRye93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"I have everything hooked up to the ""filtered 12V"" outputs. If you put a 4S lipo on then those are not 12V any more, they are still filtered though. Your ESCs and motors of course have to be able to take 4S too. The FC has to be on a setp down/BEC anyways so the step down/BEC needs to be able to take 4S too. I am using the built in one in the nucleus and it works off of 4S (measured the voltage, its 4.96 on 3S and 4.98 on 4S, so perfectly fine). And your receiver probably gets powered from the FC so no problem there.  If you need a 12V step down for the cam and vTX then things look a bit different though!"
Multicopter,3e2fow,sHockz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"Or you can just go straight beast mode and get the CM 2208 2000kv with the new rotorgeeks 20a ESCs, with 6.45 bullnose props ;)"
Multicopter,3e2fow,sHockz,2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:35 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are that you should skip the 2204/1960 and get the brand new released Cobra 2206/2100 for 4s. I just picked them up myself from rotorgeeks, and will be ordering the new rotorgeek 20a escs to go along with them for my next build.    That being said, you can use the Cobra 2204/2300kv motors on 4s now as they have worked out the ESC compatibility issues. However, a lower kv and larger stator will be more beneficial."
Multicopter,3e2fow,sHockz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:53 2015 UTC,"hmmm, that's some food for thought.  better efficiency with the 2100kv then?"
Multicopter,3e2fow,mewogoginspin,2,Tue Jul 21 13:28:59 2015 UTC,"You generate more torque with a lower kv. Think of it like a car tuned for acceleration, whereas the higher kv rating is a car tuned for top speed. If you were going for straight line speed, the higher kv would be better, but since most people want to do acrobatics and race, the ability to be able to produce thrust on demand is much more vital than topping out."
Multicopter,3e2fow,sHockz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:26 2015 UTC,"i like your theories and wish to subscribe to your magazine.  speaking my language here, so the 2100 kv is a much better balance between higher torque and max top end speed.  i think you've convinced me, do you work in sales? we are always looking for solid salespeople in our office ;)"

Multicopter,3e2fow,Tenneh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:30 2015 UTC,"This isn't necessarily true. Since you would run larger props on the 2100s, the props would have a much greater rotational inertia and therefore require more torque to get going. Both prop setups on each motors reach max prop speed quite quickly. Yes the 2100s would get 5045 props to full speed faster than 2300s would, but you would run 6045s on the 2100s compared to 5045s on the 2300s. If you can show me which reaches max prop speed faster in that scenario, then you have your answer."
Multicopter,3e2fow,A_Nub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:15 2015 UTC,my assumption was static 6045 props. thanks for clarifying this for OP
Multicopter,3e2fow,A_Nub,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:01 2015 UTC,While most (all?) 2300KV motors only officially support 3S lots of people fly them on 4S.  If want to be very cautious you could limit the max throttle in the FC or TX for the first few flights and see how things feel and how hot the motors get.
Multicopter,3e2fow,ErrorAsh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:37:38 2015 UTC,thanks for the help! think i am going to check out the newer motors and upgrade my current rig to nicer motors!
Multicopter,3e2fow,A_Nub,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:56 2015 UTC,Cobra 2204 2300kv are amazing motors and very flexible.  Its not like you are going to be disappointed with them.  They are awesome on 4S.  Try them out before ordering any new ones so you get a feel of their capabilities and how they might fit with your needs.
Multicopter,3e2fow,jolars,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:10 2015 UTC,"this is true, and thanks for the advice, i don't think that i would be disappointed but if i have a better choice for the application then i would rather go with that.  money is not much of an issue for me, i don't spend much so i usually can spare it.  however, if the reasons for using the lower kv motors weren't good enough to convince me i needed them, then i would rather not spend the money.  thanks for your advice!"
Multicopter,3e2fow,OralOperator,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:23 2015 UTC,4S is fine on 2204/2300kv as long as you pick the right props.   Stick with 5045 and you'll be fine.   If you want it to be a 4s 6045 beast go to the 1960 or get the new 2206/2100kv that the other orfson suggested.
Multicopter,3e2fow,LexusBrian400,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:38 2015 UTC,"2100 kv motors have been placed on pre-order.  looks like they are oos right now, but im not in a rush.  i was wanting to use 6 inch props on the 4s build anyways.  i'm sure those 2300kv motors will be beastly on my 3s build though, so really not upset at all just a little poorer hahaha.  on a side note the new motors are 6 dollars more."
Multicopter,3e2fow,OralOperator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:45 2015 UTC,All of this talk is nonsense if you don't tell us what props your are going to run with what escs.
Multicopter,3e2fow,LexusBrian400,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:47 2015 UTC,6 inch props and was planning on using the dys sn20a esc's
Multicopter,3e2fow,ErrorAsh,0,Tue Jul 21 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, so the poor sn20s won't hold up too well with that setup, since you can end up hitting around 25A. Sn30 will do you well. The only reason to go 1960kv would be to cut amperage draw to get a little bit longer flights from 6045 at the cost of some speed. Those motors will hold up just fine, just don't expect the sn20s to take the abuse!"
