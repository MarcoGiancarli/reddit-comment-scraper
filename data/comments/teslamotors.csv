It's better for the campaign, and Saleen needs to understand that bullying is not accepted.  Maybe we need to go Spartacus on this, and we should all post our opinion on social media networks ;)  Also, I would upload a better picture, it really helps (and makes it looks more legitimate).  Can you use a photo of the binder or your car, or does it have to be a personal pic? Whatever it is, proper resolution and focus will make a big difference.  Good luck, and keep us updated please."

I believe this likely falls under ""Manipulation"" or at least ""Other fraudulent conduct"", but that will probably have to be evaluated by an SEC official.  Fred, I strongly suggest filing with the SEC as soon as you can.  The SEC takes public discourse in the market very seriously, restricting a company's ability to positively influence that discourse with pumping and also negatively by suing people.  The idea of a collapsing penny stock abusively suing people posting negative analyses will not sit well with them, even if you're not a U.S. citizen."

teslamotors,3e3qnp,griffd,2,Tue Jul 21 19:49:43 2015 UTC,"They mainly complain about calling their way of doing business a scam. See this from my last post""   Here's the reddit thread they included as an exhibit (P-9) in the motion: Is Saleen lying in order to sell its version of the Tesla Model S?  They say that in this thread I ""urged potential buyers of the Saleen Tesla vehicles to reconsider their decision in a disparaging comment which started with the following statement: ""Saleen is running something closely resembling a Ponzi scheme/pump&dump"".  And you know what? I don't know if this can have an impact on the case, but I never said that in that particular thread. Meaning the whole exhibit P-9 is a printout of the thread and it missing that particular quote.   I did say that in another thread though, but almost a year apart and I stand by it.   ** Like I explained in the comment, Saleen is taking deposits from customers, but they don't use the money to build cars or at least only a fraction of the money, therefore they always depends on more people giving deposits, but if they all come back wanting their cars, Saleen doesn't have the money to build them - not unlike a ponzi scheme.**   and here's from the comment:    Before anyone consider buying a Saleen tuned Model S, you should know that Saleen is running something closely resembling a Ponzi scheme/pump&dump.  After unveiling the ""Saleen-Tesla"", Saleen saw their customer deposits increase significantly to over $1 million ($1,122.167) as per SEC filings, but somehow all that money wasn't put toward buying parts to tune the cars that customers have already ordered and partially paid for.  The company was reporting having $95k cash, $170k in account receivable and $150k in inventory. Meaning that at least $700k of customer deposit completely disappeared with the company relying on new deposits to try and fill previous orders, not unlike a Ponzi scheme."

teslamotors,3e3irl,rosinchard,4,Tue Jul 21 18:02:08 2015 UTC,"No need to wait, the Model S is going to get some attention @ Defcon this year (different people):   At the Defcon hacker conference in August, two renowned security professionals, CloudFlare’s research lead Marc Rogers and Lookout co-founder Kevin Mahaffey, will reveal five unpatched vulnerabilities in the Tesla Model S. They’ll be detailing those flaws before Tesla has fixed them, if no updates are delivered in the next month, leaving a gap for users to hack their own Tesla, or if they fancy breaking the law, someone else’s. Tesla has fixed one of the six bugs uncovered by Rogers and Mahaffey, according to the researchers."
teslamotors,3e3irl,GeekLad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"This is very relevant to this subreddit because the big question is, could something similar be done to a Tesla?  OK so based on the principle that most complex software has bugs that can be exploited by determined hackers unless a lot of effort has gone in to battle harden it:  Basically any car with (1) cell connectivity and (2) computers controlling the engine is potentially open to a hack like this, unless the computers controlling the key functions are completely separated from the cell-connected parts.  I would imagine with Model S there is no such complete separation, due to just how computerised the Model S is, and things like Autopilot supposedly being location aware, etc.  So I'd say the Model S is potentially open to something like this, but on the plus side (a) Tesla know their way around software better than most and (b) Teslas can be patched over the internet unlike most vehicles.  So eventually someone will do something like this to a Tesla, and Tesla will issue a patch very quickly.   A more scary scenario would be hackers hijacking the Tesla update process but presumably that would be very difficult."

What I don't get is why they're releasing the exploit (save for the part where they take over the firmware remotely).  They say they're doing it for ""peer review"".  What is there to review?  The hack works, it's extremely effective, what more do you need your peers to do other than to praise you and tell you what a 1337 h4x0r you are?  Nothing good can come from releasing such an exploit, except for others using the exploit maliciously on the thousands of cars that won't be patched for many years to come.  Leave it in the hands of the manufacturer and let it be.  Maybe they'll even offer you a job.  Also, WTF is up with these guys telling the driver to test the car on a highway and cutting the transmission.  Not only did they put the driver's life at risk, but they risked the lives of those driving around him.  These two leave me with the impression that they are irresponsible egomaniacs.  One would think that Chrysler would have some sort of recourse here to prevent them from releasing the exploit to the public."
teslamotors,3e3irl,GeekLad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:24 2015 UTC,"I don't believe they've released details of how to do the hack, they just demonstrated it to a journalist, and the journalist is saying 'holy shit this works'. Also i note that they waited until the day after Chrysler had issued a patch before going public. Now, the point it, its not in Chrysler's PR interest to publicise this fix or urge their customers to upgrade (the upgrade is a moderately complicated process involving downloading files onto a USB stick and inserting the stick into the car etc etc). So the release of the public information that this hack is possible is actually a very good way of making sure Jeep owners go and patch their systems.  re: Testing the hack on a public highway - yeah I'm with you on that one, thats irresponsible.  The rest of it makes sense though. This is how white-hats work - inform the manufacturer, wait for a patch, then release some (but not all) details to encourage end-users to upgrade."

teslamotors,3e3irl,GeekLad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:31 2015 UTC,"One argument for releasing the exploit is to convince the automakers of the seriousness of the problem.  If a company thought that they could pay a little hush-money and not fix it, they might go that route.    Software companies were/are notorious for a) suing someone who found the bug b) thanking them and never fixing it and c) publicly denying there were any security bugs.  By releasing the exploit, the hackers force the car companies to want to work with them in the finding and fixing the holes instead of covering them up.  What a car company absolutely does not want is to have a 0-day exploit cause massive damages and kill someone.  So if the hackers can force the auto companies to take them and the risks seriously, the product will be substantially improved, albeit at some cost to the automaker."

UBS says Powerwall/Powerpack, but the 5 days really means Powerwall. Instead, Tesla has been signing up and deploying utility scale customers for the PowerPack and has been so busy with interest that they can't really get to the larger commercial pool of interest. Tesla has stated that the PowerPack is expected to be 85-90% of their stationary storage business in the near term, so comments about the PowerWall as it relates to the business is usually used as a strawman. However, as the price goes down, the addressable market goes up dramatically. Just count the number of GWh of market in places like Hawaii that have very high electricity costs and/or intermittent electricity. Add in the market that uses lead acid batteries for standby storage like datacenters - that market is spending vast amounts of money on batteries they hope to not use as their cycle life sucks.  UBS is estimating 3.2 GWh of stationary storage by 2020. That's low."

teslamotors,3e2l6t,pkdomo,4,Tue Jul 21 14:48:36 2015 UTC,"New body in white line will almost double the factory capacity.... there is a ramp of course, so it will take a bit to actually double, but that's what's been going on. The paint shop upgrade was done last quarter to be able to paint 500,000 vehicles a year.  Model S is more than double original projections, so Model X release timeline doesn't mean much for the business. They would have made less money pushing out the Model X earlier... instead, they are using it to catapult the company to building at a rate of 100,000 vehicles a year, up from 50,000. So they took their sweet time with the Model X and rolled the improvements into the Model S (dual motor, upgraded battery pack, etc.).  Tesla telegraphed the capex burn quite a while ago. It shouldn't be a surprise. They manage their cash very tightly to grow as fast as they can given their cash and revenues. It's called aggressive growth, so you have to understand the dynamics of the business to know if the cash burn is a bad thing or a good thing."

teslamotors,3e2l6t,pkdomo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:09 2015 UTC,"So the original comment was about the Model X being 2 years late. And it is. But if you take a look at the context of that time, using something like Tesla's company overview in the summer of 2011:  http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/1381231132x0x494001/dd297293-ec2d-4dc5-8db4-63d491fb6bd0/Company_Overview_Q3_2011.pdf  The Model S was a 20k/year vehicle... the thought was the addressable market was around that. The Model X would then add another 10-15k units per year and due to arrive in late 2013. A bit later, it got revised to 25k/25k. So now it is 2 years late. However, reality hit in late 2012/early 2013 and the Model S reception was far, far better than expected and the market demand reaction was also far better. The Model S shipping volume made up for the entirety of the earlier volume projections and then some. They didn't need to ship the Model X to hit the current ~50,000 units/year volume. The Model S demand was so high that they had to go to Panasonic to expand cell output earlier than expected (fall 2013, new purchase agreement). It made much more financial sense to ship the living crap out of the Model S and piggy back on that demand to build out the factory far more than originally expected - again, in the context of the summer of 2011 with the Model X expected in late 2013.  So instead of shipping the Model X, they concentrated on ramping up the factory and rolling upgrades into the S. The technology changes necessary for the Model X - dual motor drive train and upgraded battery chemistry are now available on the S as a running change which is cheaper and less risky than rolling them out on the X. Matter of fact, the original factory layout was not set up for 50k unit production. They ended up retooling the BiW line last fall and shipped enough volume of the S without needing the X at all to achieve 50k/year volume. Now the Model S sells enough in the U.S. to make it the leader in the large luxury sedan segment. Model S demand itself is still not done. They are still significant untapped markets like South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, and Mexico and under developed markets like Italy, Spain, and China. The demand for a luxury $70+k BEV is far higher than most people, including Tesla management had expected.  So now, the new paint shop came online this spring with the new colors and it can paint up to the Fremont factory capacity (500,000/year). The new BiW line is coming online, and they will use that to build the X. It can actually build either X or S, so if the X is still having issues, they can build the S on it.  Basically, the company didn't need the X to ship in 2013 to hit the bottlenecks in production. The S alone was enough, so they could spend time to tinker with the X. If they needed to ship the X in order to make those volumes, they would have had to compromise earlier (all designs are compromises) and get it out the door on time. Now, with doubling production capacity to 100,000/year run rate, they will likely need to ship the X to fully utilize that. Not to mention that they are holding a lot of customer deposits and people want their X's.  Similarly, the Model 3 will likely ship whenever they need it to ship... if the Gigafactory phase 1 comes online with 7 GWh and the Panasonic Osaka plants are also churning out 7 GWh, they will likely need the Model 3 to ship in order to make sure that the output of these factories are fully utilized. Certainly it is unlikely that the S and the X alone will utilize 14 GWh. But, if stationary storage ends up blowing out demand, then maybe they don't have to rush the 3. I doubt the 3 is substantially behind... like 2 years behind since they will be approaching 25-30 GWh of output at that point. They will need it to ship to guarantee the revenue."

In q4 last year he said he expected 40% of deliveries in the first half. So actually they ahead of pace.

As the Model S proves, feed enough power to four high-quality tyres and you can out-drag a Formula One car from every set of traffic lights.   Not even close.  F1 cars go 0-60 in ~2.5 seconds nowadays and back in the era of traction control would do it in about 1.7 seconds.  The Model S (or anything besides the 918/LaFerrari/Veyron SS) can't touch that.

Hardly a sound, no gear change, no turbo spool... it's a glimpse into the future of everything automotive. Can you imagine what the supercars will look like in 10-20 years when there are several more electric vehicles in the market?

teslamotors,3dxzdh,FANGO,7,Mon Jul 20 19:20:36 2015 UTC,How many of those vehicles can turn those times with a non-expert driver at the wheel?
teslamotors,3dxzdh,AmosParnell,5,Mon Jul 20 17:12:09 2015 UTC,"Or without launch control.  I do like to bring that up.  Like when that Hellcat video came out, where the Hellcat blew it hard on a 1/4 mile, and everyone talked about the Tesla ""smoking"" him.  Obviously, the guy blew it, so it wasn't a true measure of the comparative power of the two cars...or was it?  While the Hellcat didn't get a fair start, the situation does bring up the point that you have to do everything right to get maximum performance out of a gas vehicle, whereas with the Tesla you do not.  You can get that same time (or really close) every time without having to get all your shifts right or activating launch control or whatever.  This is also why the Tesla is so much quicker 30-60 than all these other cars, which is arguably a more practical measure anyway.  You've always got that power ready to go at any time, you don't need to wait for gear shifts, or get everything right, or worry about taking the car by surprise or anything.  You don't need to press any buttons or activate any special modes (you can leave ludicrous mode on all the time, it won't affect your driving or efficiency), you don't need to sit there revving to 6k rpm and making a huge racket, etc.  It just goes."

You don't have to re-select it when you want to use it, or when you shut the car off or whatever.  At least that's the case with insane mode, I presume ludicrous will be the same (since it isn't a third distinct mode, just a renaming of insane, at least thats what the pic on the design studio suggests).  Doesn't really affect your efficiency (except if you have bad self-control), just gives you access to more torque, is my understanding.  I really don't even know why the mode is there, honestly.  Anyway, it's also the difference between ""having performance all the time, and occasionally activating an efficiency mode"" and ""having to select a performance mode when you want performance.""  With the S you can have the performance all the time and sometimes turn it off, with launch control its the other way around.  You're more likely to be able to plan on needing efficiency than you are to be able to plan on needing performance."

teslamotors,3dyi2k,pkdomo,6,Mon Jul 20 15:59:53 2015 UTC,I wish I had bought more at $36...
teslamotors,3dyi2k,Mange-Tout,3,Mon Jul 20 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"I could understand that as well.  Unfortunately, I've just recently gotten into trading because I am able to now.  Tesla is the one company that I love and feel like will be the next big thing.  While I'm late, I think I'm far from too late if I'm holding long.    I initially hesitated to buy at 262 but decided to jump in.  I'm hoping I'm not waiting too long again for a drop that doesn't happen.   If this price lingers, I may go for the buy."
teslamotors,3dyi2k,pkdomo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"I can't afford to buy anymore. The dramatic rise in price means Tesla is now my #1 single holding. It's ballooned to 10% of my portfolio. I love the stock, but I have to keep diversified."

teslamotors,3dyi2k,pkdomo,2,Tue Jul 21 00:27:04 2015 UTC,"The only chance I see is if the styling on the X is not well reviewed or a recall.  Other than that I think there won't be a large dip for quite a while, maybe if they are late on the model 3, but that's already anticipated by many.  If other western automakers don't get serious soon then Tesla could dominate the entire market in fifteen years, just as Apple/Android dominate the mobile phone market."
teslamotors,3dyi2k,jonjiv,2,Mon Jul 20 16:04:39 2015 UTC,So I guess I may have to grab some shares soon.  I'm hoping I can snag them before it hits $300.

teslamotors,3dz74m,majesticjg,8,Mon Jul 20 18:50:03 2015 UTC,"I'm in Florida as well, in the Fort Lauderdale area.  I had an S60 with a pano roof, and recently upgraded to an older CPO P85 with a body color roof.  To be honest, there's not much difference in pano v. standard, the UV coating on the pano is quite good.  I only used the pano a few months out of the year during our ""winter"", but the kids sure loved showing it to everyone.  The A/C is good, and remote cooling is a godsend.  Just turn it on 5 min before you go out to the car, and it'll be pretty cool by the time you get there.  There are some great deals on CPOs and if it's something that interests you, be sure to check out the CPO Consolidator.  You can filter the list of available inventory by those that have autopilot and those that do not.  Right now, all but one of the cars with autopilot listed are inventory S60s.  There is one CPO P85 up in Cleveland that has autopilot going for $76,800.  When you visit the detailed page for any of the CPO cars, it will indicate whether or not it is autopilot capable.  Right now, most of the ""CPO"" cars you'll see with autopilot aren't really CPO, they're inventory showroom/loaners.  They probably do have a handful of inventory 70Ds, 85Ds, and P85Ds available for purchase, they're just not pushing them to the CPO site.  You may want to contact an owner advisor to see what other inventory cars with autopilot are available.    Inventory vehicles are still eligible for the $7,500 tax credit, since they've not transferred title.  My S60 was an inventory purchase, and it knocked about $10k off the price and had 4k miles on it when I took delivery."
teslamotors,3dz74m,GeekLad,5,Mon Jul 20 19:47:56 2015 UTC,"be sure to check out the CPO Consolidator.    Your heroism knows no bounds. Thank you!  Since we're talking about building a new car versus shipping an existing car, the wait isn't an issue.   And they have one in my color..."
teslamotors,3dz74m,GeekLad,3,Mon Jul 20 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"My P85 came down from D.C. and IIRC it took about 2 weeks for them to ship it and get it prepped for delivery.  One thing you may want to inquire about before ordering a CPO (if it's a concern to you), is to inquire if the prior owner smoked in the car.    If it's a steal, you may not care if it smells like cat turds, but still one small detail that's easy to overlook with a CPO.  The new car smell was one of the little things I lost when I went for an older model with a larger battery pack.  It's one thing I missed about the prior car that I never even thought about until it was gone."
teslamotors,3dz74m,GeekLad,4,Mon Jul 20 20:22:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know if any of these are a ""Steal"" but...   How important are nexgen seats? I found a good one without them."
teslamotors,3dz74m,GeekLad,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"If you ask 10 different people, 5 of them with the nextgen seats and 5 without them, you'll probably get 2 different answers.  Both of my cars had 1st gen, and I never had any issues with them.  We took a road trip to DC and back (20 hrs. each way), and I had no issues with the comfort of the seats.  The nextgen seats do provide better support, so if you do a lot of hard cornering you won't go sliding around all over the place.  One note about the interior.  If I had my choice, I might actually go with the textile seats.  They look great, have some nice (feaux) leather accents, and you don't get the butt wrinkle in the seats that you get with leather."
teslamotors,3dz74m,GeekLad,2,Mon Jul 20 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"Well, now you've done it...   I'm lining up the financing to buy that S85 in Cleveland. It's got 90% of what I'd want if I were ordering, and at $20,000 off the brand new sticker price.   Sadly, it's not an inventory vehicle, so no tax credit for me."

teslamotors,3dz74m,kaiserpathos,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"When I saw my CPO P85 in DC, I placed the order before I had any financing arranged.  I didn't want anyone else to snag it from me.  I just checked the link and it looks like someone did get it.  I hope it was you!"
teslamotors,3dz74m,dieabetic,2,Tue Jul 21 19:38:56 2015 UTC,"It was me!   I'm still jumping through financing hoops.

teslamotors,3dz74m,dieabetic,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:56 2015 UTC,"And I couldn't wait anymore. Because it's the only S85 available on the CPO market with autopilot, I was concerned someone else would grab it. And it's in the color I want most, too. I had to give up the air suspension, 21"" wheels and nexgen seats, but I'm getting the audio upgrade package and subzero package I didn't plan on.   Having never sat in or driven a Tesla, I just ordered one, sight unseen. The difference between bravery and foolishness lies in the result, so here's hoping."
teslamotors,3dz74m,dieabetic,2,Tue Jul 21 20:05:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, good, glad it was you.  :-D  Wow, you haven't even test driven one?  You're in for a treat!  As much hype as I had read about it, as much as I was in love with the car before ever having driven it, my first drive still managed to exceed expectations.  It's an experience to behold.  Air suspension is cool and all, but not worth the price and will be more expensive to repair than standard suspension.  My S60 had it and my CPO P85 has it, but I don't know it's something I'd pay for it in a custom build.  As for the tires, I had 19"" with primacy tires on my S60 and the P85 has 21""s.  To be honest, I'd rather have 19""s because they're more efficient and will last much longer.  I drive way too much (400 mi. a week) to be driving on low-profile 21""s.  I'm going to see how well they wear, and if it seems I'm going to end up having to replace them too often, I may see if I can find someone with 19""s that wants to swap.  Let's stay in touch!  ;-)  The S60 didn't have the audio upgrade, but the P85 does.  It's definitely a nice upgrade, but you lose some side pocket space in the trunk for the subwoofer.  My S60 had subzero as well, pretty much totally useless for me in SoFla.  Being close to Orlando, you'll get a little more use from it than I did."
teslamotors,3dz74m,GeekLad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:34:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, you haven't even test driven one? You're in for a treat!   My fear is that I'll find out I'm too tall, too fat (I'm both of those things) or otherwise can't deal with the seats. I've watched all the online videos Tesla has put out and thought some things through and this just seems like ""My Kind of Car.""  I  like luxy and I like techie.  I could have bought a Panamera or a BMW, but this is more ""me.""   And 0-to-60 in 5.4 ain't bad.   Air suspension is cool and all, but not worth the price   I have a few driveways I frequent that are pretty tall to get into, but I figure I can handle them the same way I always have.   I may see if I can find someone with 19""s that wants to swap. Let's stay in touch! ;-)   Sounds like a plan. Silver 21's were my ""ideal"" but 19' Turbines are what I'm getting. That was my second-favorite, so I'm pleased. And I can put great rubber on them when they wear out. I'm a big fan of, ""Good tires = Good driving.""    but you lose some side pocket space in the trunk for the subwoofer   Next time you say, ""Play Uptown Funk"" you'll be glad you have it. I'm actually glad, now. My Chrysler 200 convertible has their top-end audio system and it's surprisingly good for a $38,000 car."
teslamotors,3dz74m,GeekLad,8,Tue Jul 21 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"1) A/C works great for me, and I'm on SoCal  2) You can Bluetooth your phone to the car and play whatever is on your phone, or you can use Slacker (free), or TuneIn, or a USB stick full of the music.  The browser does not support streaming of music as far as I know.  3) If Auto-pilot v7 is coming to Beta testers in 2-3 weeks per Elon, then maybe a month or two after that it'll be released to everyone else (pure speculation on my part here).  4) If getting CPO, best way to tell is look at the grey grill under the nose cone.  If it has auto pilot, there will be a rectangular area right in the middle.  Of course, you can always ask the Tesla rep when you are ordering as well.  As a general rule, cars produced around/after 10/1/14 have auto pilot features installed.  5) Navigation: not sure exactly what you mean.  You don't need to use Nav on phone since you have it in the car.  I'm unsure what ability you may ""lose"" - don't know enough about it.  6) Final note: I highly suggest the pano roof.  I ordered originally without, but wife wanted it so we got it.  Now I love it and wouldn't order without it.  It has some tinting to help block the heat, but you can also tint on top of that or order the pano roof screen from Tesla's online store.  Cheers"
teslamotors,3dz74m,hootyhoot,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"You're in SoCal and you like the Pano roof? I'd think that'd turn it into a rolling greenhouse really quick.

teslamotors,3dz74m,enzo32ferrari,4,Mon Jul 20 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know what voodoo is done with the glass tinting, but it's really great and doesn't seem to make the car much warmer to me.   I have left mine in the hot sun for hours and when I flip on the AC from my app it seems like it would take longer due to having the pano sunroof.  That is one of the coolest fun things about owning a modern EV, btw, remote-AC!  And it's very cold, here in TX that's important!  And, yeah, it's a very wide sunroof so when fully opened it does give a tiny little bit of a convertible feel.   Some of my back-seat passengers have commented on the airy open feeling of the pano - so maybe it's a plus for guests ridding, too.  Seems like one of those features that a lot of CPO buyers might look for as well."
teslamotors,3dz74m,Eseell,3,Mon Jul 20 19:30:10 2015 UTC,Hmm... I might have to look at one in the showroom. (Not dealership! We don't use that word!)
teslamotors,3dz74m,CashOverAss,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:08 2015 UTC,"Its very large, and goes back behind the front seats.  I really opens up the air IMO, plus it gives several extra inches of height which can be important for taller people.  Oh and you can only get roof rack with the pano roof.   It does certainly get hot just like any other car sitting out there, but remember one important thing: the Tesla app!  From your phone you can crack the roof and blast the A/C.  I don't think I've EVER entered my car with the inside being over 75 degrees... even when it is 100+ outside.  Just vent the roof and turn on the air 5 mins ahead of time.  Also, the car learns your habits and pre-cools/heats.  So my car is already on and at the perfect temp when I leave for work, and the same for when I leave work go to home.  So in summary my car may be a rolling greenhouse at times when parked outside in 100+, but I've never experienced it because of the cool features/tech.  I have seen on my Tesla app that the interior temp was 100+ at times, but again I saw that as I was venting the roof and turning on the A/C 5-10 mins before leaving.  edit Oh and I DONT have the pano screens from Tesla. Didn't see a need for them because of the above analysis.  However, if you routinely park outside (I'm garaged at home and work), I can see it might make sense."

teslamotors,3dz74m,dieabetic,2,Mon Jul 20 20:06:37 2015 UTC,"It's called ""smart pre-conditioning"", and is currently in Beta right now (no, not for Beta testers, it was given to all owners but just says ""beta"" next to it because they are still hammering out some issues).  Only problem is that if you have an irregular schedule, the car could get confused and pre-heat/cool at the wrong time.  I'd like it if they would add an option to pre-program the heating/cooling at a specific time on top of the 'learning' ability.  For example: My weekday schedule is regular (leave 7:30am for work, leave work 5:00-5:15pm), however my weekend schedule is not.  On saturdays, I often take my wife to brunch around 10am ... but not every weekend.  I noticed one day that my car was pre-cooling at ~10am on a saturday, but we were not going to brunch that day.

The point I'm making is that trusting what a service center says over corporate is silly.  The service centers don't have any details about anything.  Do you think Ludicrous mode is BS,because they have the same amount of info about that.  I'm saying we have to wait for more info.  This guy stated as fact that batteries can't be upgraded.

Step 2: Get the hell out of NYC.  This has nothing to do with purchasing your Tesla; it's just some life advice. Step 3: Do you own a company that could use a federal tax write-off?  Apply the purchase of your new Model X to a Section 179 deduction and then write off $25,000 (potentially $500,000 if we can raise the limit again! As of right now, it's a very good possibility).     Model X 85kW: $79,000 + tax Federal tax credit: $7,500 Colorado state tax credit: $6,000 Section 179 deduction: 1 Total spent: $45,500 (assuming $20,000 tax savings from Sec. 179 deduction 1, 2 )   You have now cut the price of a top-of-the-line, world's fastest, high-tech, SUV in half.     1 If you write off the entire $80,000 purchase on Sec. 179, that gives you $20,000 in tax savings assuming a 25% tax rate.  This equates to a total price of $45,500.  If you're in a higher tax bracket, you save even more.  Deducting $500,000 @ 0.396 federal ETR = $196,000... two free Teslas.    2 God forbid, if we are limited to only $25,000 for the Sec 179 deduction this year, that still comes to a $6,250 federal tax savings (assuming 0.25 ETR).  This equates to a $19,750 total savings on your new Model X.  Not free, but not terrible either!  You're buying a Tesla for the price of a loaded Ford."

teslamotors,3dy8d5,southernbenz,3,Tue Jul 21 02:28:53 2015 UTC,"Tax incentives are for the stimulation of the economy.  Even Uncle Sam, himself, acknowledges that spending $80,000 in the open market does better things for our country than giving him the $80,000 to get divided and funneled down the pork barrels.  Do we need tax money?  Of course.  But spending the money in the open market recovers an economy light-speed ludicrous speed ahead of taxing companies that just trying to stay alive.  People get paid.  People get hired.  Kids get clothes.  Companies grow.  Families buy groceries.  I'd rather my money go to paying a Tesla employee's salary than go to Uncle Sam.  edit: Having tax incentives gives a company that option.  Uncle Sam is saying, ""You can either pay me, or go make a few large purchases and help the economy even faster."" When the economy recovers, tax incentives dry up.  Everyone's doing well, making money, buying large-ticket items on their own, and taxes get funneled back into the government to be divided up again."

Tax breaks do not stimulate an economy... A strong middle class does.  the middle class spends money buying clothes, food, going out to eat, vacation's, and all other normal expenses and bills...  Compare this to the theory that tax breaks for rich people is what drives the economy... That is pure fiction.  A wealthy person can only buy so much clothes, go out to eat so often etc.  Some will say ""But the rich create jobs"".  The data disagrees!  The rich create jobs in other countries maybe, but small business owned by the middle class is what creates jobs.

Now, that said, having an LLC/trust in Colorado just OWN the car as an asset isn't really too bad.

teslamotors,3dy8d5,southernbenz,2,Mon Jul 20 20:01:02 2015 UTC,"No, you don't get to decide. The IRS defines what is and isn't a business purpose for a vehicle. ""Assisting in the daily well-being of the business owner"" is not a business purpose. Commuting to and from work is not a business purpose. If over half your use is really driving from your work to actual properties you're scouting, great. Committing a felony by lying about what you're actually doing with a car so you claim tens of thousands in illegitimate deductions and evading taxes is a hell of a good way to get sent to prison for a good long while."

teslamotors,3dy8d5,chuckymcgee,3,Mon Jul 20 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"You're both making interesting points -- thing is, if you say your business does one thing you must be able to provide reasonable documentation of those activities you say you do...travel receipts, completed project charters or SoW sign-offs (if you provide services), sales receipts (if you're selling widgets, etc), and other evidence of business activities (not just transactions --  ""I can prove I did X service, or sold Y widget"" isn't always enough to prove usage of a particular claimed business-asset, but in the case of cars, they are probably the easiest asset to claim/prove).    Trust me, if IRS decides you may be evading your true tax liabilities (misreporting purchases to reduce/avoid taxes, etc) they will seek to have a list of all persons/entities you did business with and during discovery and investigating they can compel people you regularly did business with to disclose certain basics of the services you provided (""he drove to our location - we drove to his place of business -- he drove a truck not a Tesla"" --- all questions IRS can ask), and any affidavit that those people/entities provided about those business activities...that doesn't match your version of the business transactions to support your claim to the car's utilization (or any other assets' use in your business) and you can suffer full discovery during an audit.  And this is all before you go to trial (but you wouldn't go to trial, of course, if your lawyer is decent he'll keep it from going that far and you'll settle for a true-up of your taxes + whatever extra IRS negotiates in settlement talks).  BUT...getting caught at this kind of thing is all extremely rare, and a lot of people do it often.  Especially with cars, because they're the most common asset a company will buy.  My rule of thumb is: don't do this sort of thing if you become too big, or if you do don't get too cheap or stupid --- it's often the big fish who are already setting off minor red flags, yet pulling in good money each year, and then they go and buy a boat or an S Class and claim it...and they set off that final audit flag.  lol  Of course, the catch-22 is: your business already would need to be of a certain size to be claiming some of the tax-deductions you're talking about in here.  :(  My .02, it's only worth the risk if the punishment of an audit can be predictably mitigated/reduced."
teslamotors,3dy8d5,kaiserpathos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, there's two questions to this: one, is it illegal; and two, are you going to get caught?   Let's not kid ourselves here. The IRS has put down what is and isn't a qualified business use of a vehicle. If you make up a fake company that has no revenue and have it buy a car for the purpose of you driving it around to do whatever personal stuff and then claiming it as a business deduction, that's illegal. Having an existing business and then buying a car and pretending it's getting used for business when it's not so you can claim a tax credit is also illegal.   Whether you get caught or not is another question. Yeah maybe setting up elaborate lies, claiming you're scoping out investment properties whenever you drive to a nightclub, the golf course, a restaurant, etc, might make it harder to detect you're lying. But not getting caught doesn't change the answer to the first point- it's still tax evasion. The IRS has a pretty sophisticated algorithm as to who gets audited and I'd have to wager taking the maximum deduction on a car for a business expense is pretty damn high up there on the list of abused deductions."

teslamotors,3dy8d5,tturedditor,4,Tue Jul 21 07:35:31 2015 UTC,"Total cost of ownership is considerably less compared to gas guzzlers, particularly if you drive a lot.  Of course, living in NYC I can't imagine you drive a lot, so there's not much of a value proposition there.  I drive 400 miles a week and when gas was over $3/gal., I was spending a good $200 less a month than I would have burning hydrocarbons.  The federal tax credit adds another $100 a month (if you were to spread it over the life of a 72-mo. loan).  Saving $300 over 72 months amounts to $21K.  Comparatively speaking, that essentially drops the price down to around $55K.  The more you drive and the worse the gas mileage of the car you compare it to, the better the savings.  The longer you keep the car, the more you save as well.  All this being said, I don't know that the average Model S buyer gives a crap about the value proposition.  They can afford it because they're the same people that can afford to buy a Mercedes S, BMW 7 series, not to mention the 2-seater supercars.  They buy it because it's a superb car compared to the competition."

The ongoing ownership costs are considerably less which I think you intend to say. Total cost of ownership is going to take into account the sticker price, which a Tesla at today's prices is basically never going to overcome compared to a cheap gas guzzler, especially one someone already owns. Compared to a luxury performance gas car with performance in the same ballpark, sure, TCO probably will be lower.  You're right about not giving a crap about the value proposition. People who say Teslas are expensive or are wondering how people afford them are basically just making a statement that's true about any luxury performance car and luxury car buyer."

teslamotors,3dy8d5,DrDifferdange,4,Mon Jul 20 14:56:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest fine print is you have to actually owe $7,500 in federal taxes to get the full credit.

teslamotors,3dy8d5,mlloyd,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It's a credit based on tax owed. Before all prepayments to calculate balance or refund. With 100k income, you will be cutting it close but it's possible to get the full credit depending on deductions and all."

They are supply limited on batteries. They are constrained in the factory but they are ramping up for the Model X.   As long as demand exceeds their ability to produce, it only makes sense to produce the high margin products. As long as Tesla's cash flow remains very negation as they invest in factory, superchargers, new stores, gigafactory, it only makes sense to produce the high margin products.   There's a reason the 3 is not much more than vaporware. Tesla would be stupid to start selling them now as it would reduce their income while they are still production constrained."

teslamotors,3dzrrf,-888-,4,Mon Jul 20 21:16:28 2015 UTC,We just discussed this less than 24 hours ago...
teslamotors,3dzrrf,southernbenz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on the weight and grip.  It could be 4,000 lbs and that would be lighter than the Model S.  For a sub-10 second quarter, you're looking at either ridiculous time off the line or going for a better top end.  Neither is possible with 470 hp.  There are four production cars that break that ten second barrier: the McLaren P1, LaFerrari, the Porsche 918, and the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport.  All are significantly more powerful and/or significantly lighter than the Model S.  I'd say mid-10s are a realistic guess if the new Roadster takes elements from the P85D.  Sub-10 isn't going to happen without a ridiculous price jump."
teslamotors,3dzrrf,jetshockeyfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:35:29 2015 UTC,"The P90D is a 10.8s quarter mile and 700+hp. They could make the Roadster be at least as many HP, possibly 470x2=940hp, and make it maybe 20% lighter, and wider tires. Surely they could get to 10.0s or better. I don't see why this would entail a huge price jump. Maybe $160K cost."
teslamotors,3dzrrf,jetshockeyfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:51:03 2015 UTC,"Math doesn't work like that for quarter mile times.  Three of the four cars on that list have more than 850 hp and weight under 3680 lbs (20% lighter than the Model S), and the fourth has 1200 bhp to all four wheels.  All four have tires wider than most cars rears, and all four are the biggest, baddest racers that their respective companies make.  Just for a bit of perspective, here are three cars that are in the mid-10s.  Lamborghini Aventador: 690 bhp, AWD, 3400 lbs, similar tires to the four above.  Lamborghini Huracan: 602 bhp, AWD, 3100 lbs, similar tires to the four above.  Porsche 911 Turbo S: 552 bhp, AWD, 3400 lbs, similar tires.  That's for mid-10s.  You're talking about shaving .9 seconds off the time of the P90D with a bit more power and a bit of a diet.  That's not going to bring it close.  The only way the Roadster will crack the 10 second barrier is if it's under 4000 lbs, over 900 hp, has supercar width tires, and has the aero to put the power down.  That's a massive ""if""."
teslamotors,3dzrrf,jetshockeyfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:20 2015 UTC,Well the Tesla will have immediate torque that  the others don't have. No? Not saying that alone will put it under 10.0s but I gotta think that a 10s quarter mile is Tesla's target.
teslamotors,3dzrrf,jetshockeyfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:17:40 2015 UTC,"The three less powerful hypercars all are hybrids and have more torque from electric motors + engine at idle than the tires can handle, so that's already taken into account.  The Bugatti is a bit of a special case, 1200 bhp to all four wheels tends to throw a lot out the window."
teslamotors,3dzrrf,zLtarTrate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:20:23 2015 UTC,Weird how the Tesla needs 500 more hp and 20% less weight to get from 10.8s to 10.0s.

teslamotors,3dzrrf,jetshockeyfan,0,Tue Jul 21 19:15:24 2015 UTC,"My guess is similar to the new Model S, with maybe a tenth saved off in 0-60 rush and .5 sec shaved off in the quarter. I'd be shocked if the car can pull more then 125mph in the quarter mile and do well on a track unless Tesla invest a lot into cooling.   Frankly I'd be impressed if the car can run comparable to a 911 turbo on a track, and I'm confident that it will be far off future hyper cars that will be out by then."
teslamotors,3dzrrf,SuperSonic6,2,Mon Jul 20 21:29:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like your making a lot of assumptions here. It's not speed that overheats the batteries, it's current draw. So even if the future roadster had the exact same cooling/battery/propulsion system of the current Model S, it could get under a 10 sec quarter mile just by shaving off weight to get it around the Roadsters weight, even at 500 lbs more than the roadster weights it could still probably get under 10 sec."
teslamotors,3dzrrf,Scuderia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"The old Roadster was ~2700 lbs.  I'd be floored if the new one had the Model S powertrain and was only ~3200 lbs.  And even then, sub-10s is a stretch.  Aero is a huge factor in the quarter, as is top end speed.  The Model S has neither of those advantages, that's some major slack for the Roadster to pick up."
teslamotors,3dzrrf,SuperSonic6,0,Tue Jul 21 04:37:30 2015 UTC,"Yes! Even if the new roadster just had merely the same amount of horsepower as the Ludicrous mode Model S and weighed 500 lbs more than the original roadster, it would still have no problems doing a quarter mile in less than 10 seconds. It's going to be exciting to see how fast they can get it."
teslamotors,3dzrrf,Scuderia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:37:24 2015 UTC,"it would still have no problems doing a quarter mile in less than 10 seconds.   I really don't think this car will easily get under 10sec through the quarter mile, gear starts to become a huge issue for electric cars as you gain in speed."
teslamotors,3dzrrf,SuperSonic6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:55:59 2015 UTC,"The P85D Model S is only about 5-7 mph slower in the quarter mile than ICE cars that get the same quarter mile time. Most ICE cars that can get a 9.9 on the quarter mile hit around 145 mph. The next roadster would only need to do around 135 to get the same 9.9 seconds, and considering that the roadster is going to be a sports car from the ground up, I think it's safe to assume that 1. The power to weight ratio is going to be a lot better than the Model S (mainly due to shedding weight and size) and 2. It will be geared for a higher top speed than the Model S because people will expect an electric sports car to have a higher top speed than a 4 door sedan. Example- the Model S Gear ratio is 9.73:1 and the Current roadster is 8.27:1."
teslamotors,3dzrrf,tkulogo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:55 2015 UTC,The P85D is only about 3-5mph faster in the quarter then the P85S despite having more torque and horsepower.   The P85D takes over 18 seconds to get to 135mph.

It was a gray color and might have left small marks on it when we were initially trying to find a way to install it.   After re examining the car I can confirm that they are just marks and not scratches. And certainly not left by the product we have for sale.
teslamotors,3dv60m,dieabetic,14,Sun Jul 19 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"Original post by 'Footbag' over there:  ""I had a very interesting and exciting exchange with a Tesla employee today. While waiting at a Supercharger, a Tesla pulls in with MFG plates. The individual who got out nodded to a group of us owners chatting, so I went over and said hello and asked if they works for Tesla per the MFG plates. Yes. I then asked if this car was being used to test anything (didn't see extra cameras or anything obvious). To my surprise, the answer was yes, testing Autopilot. A near 30 minute conversation followed, as the individual was much more open than I would have expected. I am being a bit vague in elements, in an attempt to protect this individual. Feel free to believe or not believe the following, I obviously have no proof (my wife would vouch for it, as she heard most of the exchange, for what that is worth lol).   This person stated they were quite high level within Tesla (my impression, based on the title they gave) Autopilot is very close to ready - i did not press for more specifics. They were unaware of Elons comments about the 405 or whatever highway with faded white lines and light concrete. To that end, there is consideration that the system may talk to the mothership to know areas where autopilot can't be relied upon, so the car will give the driver notice in advance - ""you are approaching an area where autopilot cannot function reliably, prepare to take control"" (my words based on this persons comments) Having seen a situation where a 110km speed sign was read as 10k by the car, I mentioned this to this person. They were quite shocked this happened. They did confirm the intention is that the system will automatically adjust the speed of the car (as seen in the initial demonstration, and as an improvement to the current ""set cruise to speed"" function we have now).  I suggested/asked if the system had a threshold - don't adjust speed if delta is greater than x. That is not part of the system, but they were intrigued by the idea. I asked if the car 'tells' tesla when a speed sign is 'ignored' by the driver, ie that the car detected it wrong. No such communication happens. In stop and go traffic, the system is reliable enough that the driver could be distracted while driving and still be safe (not saying this is a good thing or the intention!). This individual gave examples of doing tasks very not related to driving, and having nothing untoward result. There appears to be a bit of 'debate' within Tesla over how much the car should pester the driver to stay focused on driving. A 'new' feature just put into the software recently goes quite far towards pestering. This individual really disliked it, and was trying to get it reverted. It has to do with, and is in stark contrast to some statements Elon made a while back. I joked ""the lawyers must be getting involved"" and the response I got was a slight chuckle. We all will hope this individual gets this change reverted (but I am not so sure Tesla as a company will revert it) I brought up Elon mentioning sensor suite 2. This person confirmed that more sensors are needed for autonomous driving. No surprise. Did not ask about the Model S seen with additional cameras. Some discussion was had about laws - Tesla is keenly aware that autonomous features in cars are a grey area, that laws are typically not in place about them, and Tesla wants to implement it to be safe enough that laws don't need to get written, with the fear being that when government writes such laws, they will be too overboard on safety and will prevent features. I mentioned having owned an Infiniti Q50 for a short time - ""oh, the car that ping pongs between the lanes""... this person knew about the car. It was mentioned the team has a Merc S Class, and that is the benchmark they are trying to beat. There was confidence implied that they had beat the S Class in lane keeping. No discussion about self parking - I mean, this person got out of the car and it parked itself next to the Supercharger, but I wasn't about to point out that we all saw that (just kidding) This person mentioned it was much more relaxing driving in autopilot mode. Something said to the effect of 'if you are tired, you still are able to monitor the car just fine (autopilot on), whereas you might not be as able to drive the car safely (autopilot off)'. Again, I don't think this individual nor tesla (nor I) advocate driving a car with autopilot when you shouldn't be/when you wouldn't be able to safely drive a car without autopilot. I asked if I could see v7 which was running in the car, after a quick 'thought' ('yes' was not immediate), I was let in the drivers seat - it was made VERY clear not to try to take any pictures. I was very surprised to be allowed to sit down. The person did almost all of the interaction, except when I asked to press CONTROLS once (this was out of respect, but it seemed like this person would have been ok with me pressing buttons at will) I didn't think to press the T to see version number As talked about on here (TMC), it is the dark/flat look that was in the demo cars at the D launch. I was a bit overwhelmed, and didn't take too many mental notes about the specific looks. Icons were less cartooney. There is less contrast between the background and the text/icons - sun was shining brightly on the screen, and even the individual had trouble making out the bottom row of buttons (settings, temp, etc). The layout exactly mimics what we have - everything is in same place on the 17"" screen There is a new icon indicating charge port is open On a very quick pass through, the CONTROLS screen seemed to be the same. The individual jumped through some pages, I didn't notice anything, but certainly may have missed items. It was implied that there were not any BIG new features - I did not see an APPS icon for instance - and it is still the same 2 open windows layout. This relates to my perception the person would have let me press buttons at will - in that there wasn't anything present they thought needed to be hidden. The top icons (nav, music, etc) did not seem to be 'in a tray' as they are now (or so my memory recalls - again, didn't think to pay enough attention) This individual stated being very bothered when various button presses would take time to activate - so the team spent considerable effort speeding response times up - but are limited by the hardware (I did not ask about model X having a faster processor) This person never uses the web browser (who does LOL), so couldn't comment if it was much faster. When launched, it was set to go to youtube.com - but didn't load in a few seconds and we moved on. Typing this now, youtube is an odd site for it to automatically launch to, I wonder if they added in video playback? but again, the site didn't load, so that is just a guess on my part. Car was running 3G - From what I read here, LTE hasn't really sped things up for owners, but this individual indicated it should, FWIW Nothing obvious changed with backup camera.  Panning in Nav seemed smoother/quicker.  Did not see Music or Energy windows. I did joke about there being a bunch of little features that likely were added, the person indicated indeed there are. One such little feature, and one this person never even noticed before I pointed to it (in this persons defence, autopilot was their focus, not the V7 overhaul), was a LOCK icon at the very top left of the screen. It appeared to indicate if the doors are locked or not. This individual never actually noticed it there before. Did not test, but I suspect it may be a quick way to lock/unlock the doors - yay."""
teslamotors,3dv60m,bluenation_tesla,9,Sun Jul 19 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"More:  ""- The instrument cluster follows the same dark/flat approach.  - The energy graph and nav were on screen. As much as I said 'flat', these two were 'rounded', in the sense of round dials - the energy graph no longer is the rectangular design. - v7 UI Overhaul is very close, again except for the rounded energy graph (and I'm pretty sure Nav was rounded as well, but less certain) - As the car wasn't in motion/on (i didn't step on the brake), nothing of note was displayed in the center area. - It was mentioned that the center area got a large redesign. I honestly couldn't grasp/picture what was being explained to me - it sounded like the round dial interface was gone - which would seem to be represented in the above link/picture. - The center area is going to show the cars position in relation to the lane markings - It (or somewhere) will also indicate the position and distance of cars/objects around you - ""very dynamic"" were the words used. - It was mentioned that if you got too close to an object beside you, the car would move you away. I interpreted that as a means to prevent/reduce impact of side swiping.   I asked about working with Elon. This individual apparently works closely with Elon. Elon is is very demanding, but a good guy. Nothing surprising there! Ludicrous mode came up. This person stated that after doing several launches, they felt sick - and such was not the case with Insane launches. It sounded pretty intense - but at the same time, this person stated that their opinion was it was not worth the $5000 it would cost to upgrade my P85D. My wife liked hearing that. I'll still likely try to get the upgrade regardless  Talked about what led to the titanium shield. It was stated at the time the cars ride height was super lower ""basically scraping the pavement... similar or lower than ferarri/lambo"". Implying our current low (air suspension) ride height is quite a bit higher. An unlucky/lucky driver ran over something after getting the titanium shield installed. Tesla service brought the car in, the shield did exactly what it was supposed to and there was no damage to the battery pack The titanium shield could need replacement if 'used' - if you run over something that it has to 'crush'. It was made to be very quick and easy to replace. This person mentioned that in the 2 instances that resulted in fire (and let to titanium shield), if there wasn't a battery pack under the car (ie gas car) and if everything else was equal, the object would have went through and into the passenger compartment, possibly causing injury/accident.   I think that is about it. There may be a tidbit here or there I forgot to mention. Given that this was very impromptu and that I was super excited to be talking to a Tesla person who was more than willing to answer questions, I'm sure there are questions I should have asked but did not. I tried not to be too bothersome, and I cut it off out of respect to this individual (and my wife, who wanted to get on with our vacation in Cali).   Unrelated, but info gleaned from the factory tour: - It sounded like tours are handled by 3 people. As a small team, they simply can't handle public tours yet. My wife asked about school tours (being a teacher) - that is in the works, it sounds like some additional staffing is planned, and early next year they want to open it up to public (and school) tours - The TMC banner that resulted from the pizza drive is in the main employee entrance. Staff had no idea where it was or what I was talking about, but kindly took us there on a whim and it was the right location. These 2 staff walk by it occasionally but just never notice it. Pictures were allowed, but only of the sign. - Our tour guide was 11am Friday, same time as the announcement. At the beginning of our tour, someone asked our guide what the announcement would be, the guide said they didn't know. I thought he might be faking it. After the tour, when we could use our cell phones again and it was determined it was ludicrous mode and larger battery, that same individual seemed VERY surprised/interested, so I believe he knew nothing (which makes sense, given his role is to talk to the public LOL). Another employee, slightly more senior, admitted he was briefed on some of the announcement, but with minimal detail (of course, he could just be saying minimal detail, I have no idea) - I feel sorry for Tesla staff at the time of big announcements - people were there picking up their cars after the tour and after the news broke, and people seemed disappointed that their new car wasn't the latest/greatest anymore. - Out of respect for NDA, won't say much about the tour itself. It wasn't as great as I anticipated it being (expectations maybe too high) - but it was good of course. We had a very pleasant surprise  Tesla let a 'skeleton' out of the closet so to speak - and this 'skeleton' had LOTS of signs demanding no photos. Was the highlight of the tour. The ""bones"" of this ""skeleton"" were also visible at times through the tour - if you made a point to look for them. - Model X and Model 3 were mentioned numerous times - although not much was said about the model 3... - 200 cars a day/1000 a week are being made currently we were told."""

It was 90 degrees for a 6 hour drive down to kentucky and the kids actually got too cold in the back with these and had to turn it off. It sits on the floor. The kids can reach it and turn it on or off and slow or fast.  I bought a 12v cig ligher extension to run to the back and it works well.

teslamotors,3dvxqw,TROPtastic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:30:21 2015 UTC,"In your standard drag ""car"", the CoG results in the weight transferring to the rear tires, and then 2wd is fine as traction is ~ proportional to weight. During the transition time, the AWD gets an advantage.  I suppose EVs have an inherent advantage, in being able to lower the CoG, and providing low weight AWD."
teslamotors,3dvxqw,badcatdog,7,Mon Jul 20 12:03:25 2015 UTC,"If we increase the traction to 1.35   And there's your problem.  There's no way to simply increase the traction to 1.35, if there was, everyone would be doing it.  To accelerate, you need grip from the tires.  To get more grip, you need stickier tires, AWD, or downforce.  Under 60 mph, it's damn hard to get a large amount of downforce.  That means you need to look at sticky tires or AWD.  Now the Porsche 918 has all three factors, it has huge sticky tires, AWD with electric motors up front, and a nice big wing.  And despite all that, it can't go lower than 2.2 seconds.  The new roadster will have skinnier tires, much less downforce, and AWD is a maybe at best.  Unless you're planning on putting proper slicks on and using a rubber drag strip, 2.1 is a pipe dream."
teslamotors,3dvxqw,jetshockeyfan,2,Mon Jul 20 00:58:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't know the tire width of the new roadster had been determined. Why would we assume a 5+ year newer car would have less good tires and wouldn't be able to generate the same downforce? The Tesla will also be full electric, and that can't hurt. I didn't know about the Porsche 918, but it makes me think I'm in the right ballpark. 5 years of tire development alone should allow a slight improvement. Add that to the other advantages Tesla has, and it makes me wonder if they can get there in under 2 seconds. I change my estimate to 1.99. Past that, they're going to need active downforce."
teslamotors,3dvxqw,TROPtastic,7,Mon Jul 20 01:35:20 2015 UTC,"Why would we assume a 5+ year newer car would have less good tires and wouldn't be able to generate the same downforce?   Downforce is does not have a huge effect on 0-60 performance unless you want a spoiler like this one, so let's look at the tires. I don't think anyone is saying that the Roadster tires would be ""less good"", but that you really need tires with a large contact area for maximum traction. The 918 with all it's electric and conventional AWD power still needs 21 inch rear tires that are 12.8 inches wide. The Model S has 19/21 inch tires that are 9.6 inches wide, and the Roadster has 16 inch tires that are 6.9 inches wide.   I was actually going to refute the main point of your comment, that the next Roadster would have a 0-60 time faster than the 918, but after actually doing the calculations I think it's really achievable. With 4 years of yearly 5% improvements, the Model S battery will decrease from 1250 lbs to ~ 1000, the same weight as the old Roadster battery. Thus we can reasonably expect the next Roadster to have a battery that is even lighter (lighter car means lighter battery required to propel it), and thus the next Roadster could very easily have a weight less than 3500 lbs if they kept the 2 motors relatively light. I don't think that the huge power levels of the 918 are needed given how well the P85D performs while having half the power, less torque, and weighing almost a 1000 lbs more. If the Roadster has the same levels of traction with huge rear tires and improves on the Model S power delivery system (the latter seems mandatory for a serious sportscar effort), I actually don't see a reason why the 918 time can't be beat. Maybe the next Roadster won't have a 0-60 time of < 2 seconds, but 2.1/2.2s definitely sounds achievable."

The new Roadster is slated for 4 years out from what I've seen, and you're talking about making it a ridiculous 900 hp monster.  That's not to say it isn't possible, but the 918 manages its time of 2.2 seconds to 60 with 325 Sport Cup 2s on the read and 265s on the front, 887 combined hp, and active aero, all bone stock.  The new Roadster would have to exceed that from the factory.  It's not impossible, but it would mean the new Roadster would cost at least double the price of the P90D.

Pulling out 5 seats and a trunk will drop very little weight, and you're missing the point here.  It's not as simple as dropping weight.  The Roadster is radically different from the Model S, it's an entire new chassis with mostly new parts.  A cannibalized Model S won't work for a decent electric roadster.  You have to design a new chassis, new components, new body, wind tunnel test it, suspension, and because it's a drop-top, it's inherently compromised compared to anything with a solid roof.  You lose rigidity which has to be made up by the sides, which adds more weight.  AWD is heavy, even just with electric motors, as are battery packs.  Dropping more weight means moving to carbon fiber, adding more cost.  If there was an easy way to hit 2.1 or 2.0, don't you think Porsche would have hit it with the 918?   Again, I don't understand why they wouldn't use the same or better tires.    It's not as simple as just sticking on better tires.  Sport Cup 2s are top of the line tires, arguably as sticky as you can get without seriously compromising longevity.  You can probably go as wide as 355s, but you're looking at making a Roadster that's a bare minimum of Viper size.  That's a big car.   What problems do you anticipate with heat soak?   The same problems the Model S has.  Things are cramped in the underside and electric motors get really hot really fast.  Cooling is complicated and hefty."

teslamotors,3dvxqw,SuperSonic6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:21:23 2015 UTC,"It's pretty easy to predict that particular future with just a small set of data points.    1)  They don't really seem to want to sell non D (dual motor) Model Ses.  They may be backtracking on this a little bit with the non-D 70 they just announced, but they've already clearly signaled that they consider the non D version of the S the budget econobox of the lineup and all the value is in the D; and    2)  The D increased mileage range and even though it added weight, it increased the car's ability to corner.  Given just these two data points, I will bet you a lifetime of Reddit Gold that even if the Roadster comes in a one-motor configuration, there will definitely be a D version of the Roadster. Elon really likes the redundancy of the dual motors.  I think the only question is whether the next Roadster will have two motors or four.  As for the GT3 comment... you do understand that they already... in 2015, have a drive train that makes almost 700 horsepower (or whatever the P90D is going to wind up getting pegged at.)  So why you would think they'd scale that back a couple hundred horsepower for the Roadster -- I do not know.  The GT3 RS has 500 hp, the regular GT3 has less."
teslamotors,3dvxqw,jetshockeyfan,2,Mon Jul 20 22:20:15 2015 UTC,Tesla has stated that the new Roadster will be quicker than the P90D. Doesn't that make it very likely it will be AWD?
teslamotors,3dvxqw,SuperSonic6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:33 2015 UTC,"I don't see how 2.1 is a pipe dream, it seems completely achievable to me, even without a change in tires. In fact I think they should go for 1.99 sec 0-60. Think about it like this, If a 4700 lbs pound car can acheve 1.1 gs acceleration that means each one of its tires is pushing off the ground with 5,749 Newtons of force. If the future roadster weighs 3000 lbs and its tires can push off the road with the same amount of force then it would accelerate the car at 1.7 gs. Now obviously the tires aren't going to be able to provide the same amount of force as the model S due to the lighter weight of the roadster but they would surly be able to get the car at least in the ballpark of a 1.35 g acceleration if not more. Couple this with the fact that battery and motor technology will continue to improve, weight saving techniques will continue to improve, and most importantly the car will be built from the ground up to go fast and getting to a 1.9 0-60 time while not easy, is definitely achievable.  If a group of 30 students can build this http://www.electricautosport.com/2014/11/faster-formula-1-electric-race-car-0-100-kmh-1785-seconds/ I believe an army of tesla engineers can get a small 2 door sportscar around the 1.9 sec mark.   TL;DR Tesla could get into the low 2 sec 0-60 times simply by integrating the Model S powertrain into a 3000lb car. By building the roadster from the ground up as a sports car a 1.9 0-60 is definitely possible."
teslamotors,3dvxqw,jetshockeyfan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:09 2015 UTC,"Again, the 918 couldn't do it despite pure carbon fiber construction, crazy aero, and some of the stickiest road tires available.  And you're expecting the Tesla to shave a full three tenths off that?  Math doesn't work like that.  Returns diminish like crazy with 0-60 times, and the 918 is pushing the limits of what's currently possible.  Unless the Roadster is a $500k+ supercar, it won't touch the 918.  Mark my words."
teslamotors,3dvxqw,SuperSonic6,3,Tue Jul 21 00:09:45 2015 UTC,"The Porsche 918 is 1000 pounds heavier than the current roadster and doesn't even have has much horsepower as teslas fastest 4 door sedan. A roadster will more than likely be lighter than a 918 and also have at least as much power as a ludicrous mode Model S (considering it's going to be a sports car).   Also the Porsches ""crazy aero"" give it a drag coefficient of .29 which is much higher than the model s .24  Pointing out that the 918 has carbon fiber, crazy aero, and super slick road tires only supports my point. If a 4 door sedan can achieve 2.8 0-60 without any of that, imagine what a car built from the ground up for speed can do.  Example http://www.electricautosport.com/2014/11/faster-formula-1-electric-race-car-0-100-kmh-1785-seconds/ (a group of 30 students built this)  If you were to tell someone two years ago that the model S could do a 2.8 0-60.

teslamotors,3dvxqw,jetshockeyfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:46 2015 UTC,"The current Roadster won't fit the P85D powertrain and doesn't have the chassis stiffness or tire space to put down the power.  Also, the 918 has 887 hp versus the P85D's 691 hp.  Not sure where you're getting your numbers from.  The aero is helpful in putting power down, and any proper sports car nowadays has to have crazy aero to be manageable.  A four door sedan hitting 2.8 doesn't mean a Roadster can hit 2.2 or lower.  First of all, diminishing returns.  Going from 2.8 to 2.2 is harder than going from 3.8 to 2.8, a lot harder.  But more importantly, the 918 is a purpose-built racer.  Even if the Roadster is purpose-built for speed, it has a bunch of disadvantages.  The powertrain will be heavier than the 918 thanks to the weight of batteries.  The chassis will be heavier than the 918 to accommodate the lost stiffness from the lack of a roof.  And to have wide enough tires to put down the power, the Roadster will have to be at least as wide as the 918, probably even wider.  Larger car means even more weight.  So even if the Roadster uses pure carbon fiber and proper aero and tires, it would be difficult to match the 918, never mind beat it.  And that's already considerably more expensive than the P90D."

It's nowhere near that easy to make a fast production convertible that's street legal and usable."
teslamotors,3dvxqw,SuperSonic6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:14:15 2015 UTC,"Electric power gives no advantages besides immediate torque.   This is he most telling sentence you have said so far, electric cars have so many advantages it's not even funny. Electric cars can go faster than gas cars without spinning the tires because they can adjust the amount of torque instantly hundreds of times a second to ride the line of the maximum performance the tires can handle.  Gas cars ethier cause the tires to slip or are underpowered enough during launches to get full grip but do not take full advantage of the tires ablilties.   Another thing, the white zombie is only using two of its wheels. If it were using all 4 it wouldn't need but half of the grip it's using.   What I really want to know is the main thing your trying to communicate. Are you saying that a stock production car with street-legal tires will never go faster than a Porsche 918? or are you saying that if one does that it won't be electric?"

teslamotors,3dvesr,jobminepirate,5,Sun Jul 19 23:30:16 2015 UTC,"So much misinformation in this article.   But Ludicrous Mode cranks the Model S up to 11. Yes, it truly does. Through some complicated electrical engineering and the addition of a 90kWh battery option, the Model S P85D can, according to Tesla do 0-60 in 2.8 seconds, breaking the highly symbolic 3-second barrier and serving up straight-line performance reserved for roughly half a dozen so-called hypercars, such as the Ferrari LaFerrari and the McLaren P1 — exotic beasts that cost more than a million bucks.    Not true, the Porsche 911 Turbo S clocks in at 2.5, as does the Lamborghini Huracan, and the Lamborghini Aventador and GT-R Nismo come in at 2.7.  All four are under half a million. That's  not to say it's not impressive, it's ludicrous (heh) that a family car can deliver that kind of acceleration.  But the 3-second club isn't just for exclusive million dollar cars.   The P85D — actually, it should probably be called the P90D, with the 90kWh upgrade — costs a bit more than $100,000.   $120k is not ""a bit more than"" $100k.   Over the next few years, the Model S will also for all practical purposes be able to drive itself, as Tesla improves its current autonomous-driving features. Other vehicles can drive themselves. But obviously, it will be a while before the Google Car can outrun a Ferrari 458.   Huge exaggeration.   But let's get real. On Friday's conference call, I asked Musk if Tesla had been forced to make any suspension or chassis adjustments to the Model S to tolerate the 2.8-second 0-to-60 performance. He said nope, they just plunked the new battery pack and electronics into the old S and set the sucker loose. Vroom!   Well yeah, the chassis and suspension can already handle that kind of acceleration.  The ""old"" Insane Mode could hit 60 in 3.1 seconds.   Any other automaker would have to basically create a whole new car to take advantage of a 0-60 time that broke the 3-second mark. At the very least, they would have blinged up the design in some aggressive way. A faster machine would have to announce, visually, it faster-ness. You would also need an ocean-going shipping container full of money to buy it.   The GT-R would beg to differ.   The Model S, on the other hand, didn't even get a bigger rear spoiler.    Why would it....?   The car's basic engineering is so good that it could take its new hypercar-grade acceleration in impeccable stride. That's some masterful engineering.    That's the benefit of instant torque off the line.   Critics will say that straight-line speed is all well and good, but the true test of a performance car is its ability to go around corners.    Yep.   I'm no pro   You should probably stop right there.   but I didn't think the P85D had any issues whatsoever with handling. The all-wheel-drive system makes the thing feel glued to the road. It's almost too planted in the curves. The slightly more rear-end-wiggly Model S is more fun.   ""Doesn't have issues"" isn't a selling point.  It feels planted, but it's still slower than competitors through the corners, as far as I know.   What we should do for now is take a moment, consider the current Model S in all its glory, and reflect on what a ludicrously marvelous piece of work it is. Tesla and Musk set out to build the Great American Car: beautiful, fast, game-changing. Really, the Greater American Car. And with the Model S, they did it.   This is about the only part of the article I agree with.  Tesla did something truly outstanding: they set out to make an electric car that's genuinely good.  And they did it.  They trumped the likes of Mercedes and BMW in the electric car field, fair and square.  That's something that's extremely impressive."

You're jumping between three different categories here.  The Model S is a full size sedan comparable with the 5-series and A6.  The 750iL is much larger, as is the A8L.  Anyways, if you spec out a 5-series (probably an M5) and an A6 (probably an RS6) to match Model S prices, you get better performance in almost every way from the gas cars.   Also, a Tesla only takes a few seconds to plug in, not two minutes. Not sure what you're talking about there.   It takes two seconds to plug in, but a lot longer than that to charge.

The Model S' rear space is not adequate for chauffeur vehicles, although I am aware there is an ""executive seat"" option available but that is a center console. They have yet to add the luxuries of, say, the A8L or S550 (massage seating and extremely good ride quality).  As far as gas refueling goes, the driven passengers almost never see that element. The vehicle is refueled by the chauffeur while they are in a meeting or some sort of equivalent (ie. on an inbound flight). If there was a journey long enough to actually refuel, the driven would most likely fly anyway."

I can get the car warm or cool before I get there, I haven't been to the gas station in 2 years (I did the math a little while ago; I've skipped ~100 gas station visits), it's always the right temperature, it's streaming music online and is using google maps to navigate me around traffic to my destination.  My favorite thing is actually the silky smooth throttle response/control, especially at that 1-5 mph range that gas cars really suck at, and the fact that it's totally silent so I can launch off the red light without the ""look how big my peener must be"" roar.  Sure, you can absolutely find a car that does one or two or three things better than the Tesla, but I absolutely wouldn't trade it for anything that I can think of. Million dollar Ferrari/Aston Martin/Bugatti ? No thanks. Mine's fast, luxurious, and practical, and it gets better with every software update."

I just can't agree with the people saying it's a performance bargain because there are several cars that I can think of from the top of my head that are comparably priced and will outperform the Tesla in terms of acceleration and handling, and especially track performance. But, they do it at the expense of things like practicality, nvh, luxury, comfort, etc. and I get that. Personally, I'm a bit of a masochist when it comes to driving because I prioritize performance over just about everything else, so I prefer cars where those aspects are more compromised. I already own a BMW Z3 M Coupe and a dunebuggy, and my next car is going to be either a C5 Z06 or a C3 project car for track days. I just like stupid impractical performance cars like that... though the Z3 does have at least a little grocery-getting utility value with the rear hatch, which is really all I need of it."

The only thing that I dislike about the Tesla in these terms is it has less road feel than I'd like (you can switch the steering from ""comfort"" to ""standard"" and ""sport"" but imo it just makes the steering wheel harder to turn, but doesn't give you much more road feel) and it's not exactly a... ""nimble"" car. I mean, it's gigantic, so I can't expect it to be as quick as a little rally car or roadster or something, but I guess just as a personal preference I tend to like little quick cars.. And it sucks to park because it's big.  On the other hand, a few weeks ago I really did fit all my kitesurfing gear in there, a tent and sleeping bags and a few bundles of firewood and a bunch of water and a few duffel bags and backpacks and 2 folding chairs... and then I decided that I'm too damn old and my back hurts too much to sleep on a sleeping pad and the car's big enough, so I took the 4 gigantic seat cushions off the two 3-person sofas I have and threw them all in the car with some pillows.

Bend them into a turn, however, and the lighter (more evenly weight-balanced) i8 takes the lead, generating 0.94 g of lateral grip to the Tesla's 0.91. That cornering advantage allowed the BMW to carry a bit more speed through the ends of our figure-eight course, while the AWD helped it claw its way out more quickly, carrying a 4-5 mph advantage on the Model S at corner exits. This added up to a scant 0.2-second advantage (24.6 to 24.8) with a tie in overall average lat/long g at 0.80. Again, unimaginably close performance for such disparate vehicle types. Let's give the advantage to BMW, by the slimmest of margins.   So, the company which has been doing this for 100 years and has a 1300lb, 3 seat, ~$40k advantage still barely manages to squeak ahead.  This is vs the P85+, btw, not the P90D.  Which I presume would change things in favor of the Tesla, as AWD does help handling (and of course straight-line speed, by a ton)."

I see no reason why the main contactor would be heavier since the only change to that is to substitue inconel from an uspecified metal (the relative density of inconel625 is 8.44, denser than iron but less dense than copper and anyway there would only be grams of it).

The weight balance on the P85D is 5% further forward than on a P85+, and it weighs over 40kgs more to boot.  Seeing as the P85+'s suspension is nothing to write home about, and nothing is changed in the P85D, it's probably going to handle terribly."

You were the one who brought up BMW's intentions.  I posted BMW's intentions.  If you don't want to talk about BMW's POV, then why did you bring it up?   BMW makes power when they want to.   Ah, right, this ""argument.""  BMW can make waaaayyy faster cars, they just don't.  So we should compare all cars in the world to hypothetical cars that you just made up in your head, and BMW is the only company which can make hypothetical cars, surely nobody else can.  Also, that's why today's BMWs are so much slower than BMWs of the past, because they're just holding themselves back, you know, to give everyone else a fair shot.  Out of the kindness of their hearts.  They're truly the most magnanimous business venture in the world.  Come back when you stop dreaming.  Cheers."

My camaro will easily pull 1G if I buy the right tires.  Any vehicle will pull 1G if the center of gravity is low enough for it not to roll.

You know what's not on there?  A Mustang:  1.) Katech Chevrolet Corvette Z06 ClubSport :  1.12  2.) Dodge Viper SRT10 ACR   :  1.08  3.) Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1:  1.07  4.) Bugatti Veyron: 1.00  5.)

But I'm making an assumption that if a GTR and a GT2 couldn't do it in 2008, a v6 Mustang can't do it today.  In fact, it seems to be the case.  Here's what Car & Driver says about the 2015 Mustang's skidpad rating:   At 3948 pounds, this convertible weighs 138 more than the last Mustang coupe we tested. But with 53 percent of the mass sitting atop the front wheels, its weight distribution actually gets closer to the magic 50/50 mark than the coupe, which carries 54 percent of its heft up front. Still, even equipped as it was with optional 20-inch wheels and summer rubber, the convertible mustered only 0.90 g on the skidpad with very little understeer, compared with 0.95 g for the coupe (or 0.98 g in the case of the 291-pound-lighter EcoBoost coupe).

Model S GVWR is 5,710 lbs according to google. Tesla lists the curb weight (no passengers/cargo) of the Model S at 4,647 lbs.  If that GVWR is correct and we take Elon's 10% more esitmate, that puts the Model X with a GVWR of 6,281 lb.  That figures in an extra passenger / cargo capacity of 10% as well. If we just go by curb weight with the same passenger/cargo capacity we get a Model X curb weight of 5112 lbs + about 1000lb passengers/cargo for a GVWR of about 6100 lbs.   So it looks like it will probably top the 6000 lb GVWR but it's a bit close to say for sure until Tesla releases full specs."

Companies in the USA can make business purchases and deduct them from taxable income.  A recent popular deduction is called the Section 179 deduction that, among other things, allows companies to deduct vehicle purchases (wherein the GVWR is over 6000 lbs) up to $25,000 (or historically $500,000 which may be brought back again).  It is commonly called the Hummer Tax Loophole, as the Hummer, Escalade, Suburban, Porsche Cayenne Turbo, etc. do all qualify."

Lots of new material for sure and a must-read for fans.   However I do think the book was lacking in certain areas, and maybe should have been longer. Or written by a more technically-inclined author?   For example, regarding Tesla, I was hoping for the inside perspective on several seminal events for the company. For example, Elon's ingenious stock market short-squeeze that he used to pay back the government loan. Or the whole 'Brodering' affair.   Hopefully there will be many more books on the subject to come."
teslamotors,3dvnl3,Clebername,2,Mon Jul 20 14:57:53 2015 UTC,"It was good, no doubt. But I sincerely hope someone like Walter Isaacson does a bio on him someday. The book was good, but mainly because Musk's story is like that of a character from an Ayn Rand novel. The story carried the book, so to speak. I'd love for an author on par with the story to create something truly magnificent. There was a certain poignancy to the Steve Jobs story that Vance's prose didn't really create."

I’m sure they are very frustrated when I explain to them, in excruciating detail, how impossible it is to know such a thing. I used to track stats like crazy back when I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to make a living this way. And it was often depressing – songs like Baby Got Back or Code Monkey would get huge traffic and few sales, and the performance of less successful songs like Drive or Resolutions are best left undiscussed. But somewhere along the way the bottom line started improving, and I became less obsessed with tracking every little thing. Now I sort of think of the whole engine as a special genetically engineered cow who eats music and poops money – I have no idea what’s going on in its gut, and I have the luxury of not really caring that much about the particulars.""
