Technique is the most important factor in terms of getting as high as possible. The MFLB is not a simple device, it takes a lot of time and practice to learn how to get what you want from it.  https://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/1w577s/mflbninjas_guide_first_edition_stacking/  I would advise you to read this guide and try out the techniques covered in it before investing in another vape.

Make it a habit and it's so much easier to use!
mflb,3dwla7,somanyroads,5,Mon Jul 20 04:40:12 2015 UTC,"Easy! Put battery in, let it heat, take hit, take battery out straight away. Once it's in your system you do it automatically. When I use a friends box (with the ring) I still do it out of habbit."

mflb,3dwla7,TheSublimeLight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"Basically, there's a small little rubber ring that comes in every launch box (might not have been in the early versions, though). When it works properly, it means you can insert your battery but you have to press it in for the battery to make contact, like a button. It adds springiness.  If you're like OP and you don't put the battery cover on the back end when you use it, pressing the battery against your hand can be annoying. If you so choose to you can remove the push-back ring from your launch box. If you do, when your battery is fully inserted the box will light up, and you won't have to press in the battery at all.   This can be convenient, but it adds another step, as you have to remove the battery to make sure you aren't accidentally burning your weed in between hits.  Hope that clears things up!"

Use a little rubbing alcohol to wipe off the sticky gunk from the sticker.   I was considering using my Li-Iom 2700 mah 3.7 volt batteries, but the MFLB website highly does not recommend those. The higher voltage will damage your MFLB and can get really hot burning your fingers!  As for a charger, I recommend this one:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0096U26QQ/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1437406855&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SY200_QL40&keywords=intellicharger&dpPl=1&dpID=41E7nbJ5btL&ref=plSrch  It can charge multiple battery types and detects each kind of battery (to adjust charging parameters so the battery doesn't go BOOM). Just remember when you're charging batteries on it, only charge one battery type.   For experienced users....can someone verify if the above charger is 100% good? Currently I only use it for my e - cig batteries so I haven't tested my MFLB batteries on it yet."
mflb,3dycz9,captaincupcake234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:36 2015 UTC,Thanks! As far as chargers go I'm looking for something that can hold at least 4 batteries at once.
mflb,3dycz9,captaincupcake234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:03:25 2015 UTC,Here's the same charger brand but it has a 4 battery capacity  http://www.amazon.com/Nitecore-IntelliCharger-i4-Battery-Charger/dp/B005UAI372

mflb,3dycz9,arilotter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:57:29 2015 UTC,The MFLB website also sells a set of two batteries for $9.99 right now if you don't want to go through the trouble of peeling off the sticky stuff on the Powerex batteries I recommended below.
mflb,3dz1xo,ADHDABE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"So I finally figured out the perfect setting in my PA for use with the MB and figured I'd share it.

mflb,3dz1xo,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:36 2015 UTC,No I don't simply because it seems like I have to run the PA at very minimal settings to preserve taste and not roast the shit out of the trench. I have tried it and the battery seems way too hot.
mflb,3dz1xo,MrGort,3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:56 2015 UTC,"Would you be able to post a nice, all encompassing video of it in action? Not too far away & jittery, but close in, on the bellows action and the vapor it pushes out the draw stem? Carefully backlighted, with a dark background?

mflb,3dz1xo,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:52 2015 UTC,If you give me instructions on that last part. I have a tripod and camcorder/nice camera to make a clean video.
mflb,3dz1xo,Whipped_Duck,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:01 2015 UTC,"Drape a table with a dark sheet for your horizontal background, and a few feet away hang another dark sheet for vertical background. Keep your camera angled and tripoded so there is no visible gap between them.    Now position everything on the table, crop and focus. And now is the time to play around with the lighting angles and direction, tripoded as well. This may require ± several active takes.    When everything is kopacetic, without moving anything except ""cocking"" the bellows, and reloading and exactly repositioning the MFLB, begin your final shoot.    Who said commercial photos were easy? Much less a video. The bright side is you get to be sipping vapor for each take. You don't want to waste those cannabinoids."
mflb,3dz1xo,compoundbreak791,2,Mon Jul 20 20:25:33 2015 UTC,"Edit: this may help, or cause confusion. LOL    You will likely need at least two tripoded lights. One for the tabletop, and one for the backlighted vapor."

mflb,3dw2ph,thatguy1599,3,Mon Jul 20 02:34:29 2015 UTC,Is the point of the rubber band to keep the lid closed while you shake it?
mflb,3dw2ph,Ima_be_worrying,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:11:13 2015 UTC,I am also wondering this. If this is the case then I need this. I have to push the lid closed to prevent vapor from escaping.
mflb,3dw2ph,BeautifulJade,2,Mon Jul 20 03:36:34 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the battery - lid trick yet?  If not, you take your battery, and make it touch the top metal 'clip' looking thing on the top, back, part for a couple seconds. You should be looking pretty close at it, and will see and feel sparks when it makes a circuit. ONLY DO THIS FOR LIKE 2 SECONDS AT A TIME.   Ready, buzz, buzz, stop, check (move it around a little, and make it just a biiit tighter than you think is good since it'll loosen up over time.) Rinse, repeat as necessary.  This melts the top part of the lid a little, and hold the clip in better. Don't do it too much, but it's not going to break your mflb or make it toxic."
mflb,3dw2ph,marrio91,3,Mon Jul 20 08:02:08 2015 UTC,That what I did the first day I got mine. Haven't needed to find a rubber band since.
mflb,3dw2ph,nCubed21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:57:48 2015 UTC,"Same, and I've purchased two of them (somebody stole mine at a party, along with an oz of Golden Moses...asshole.)   At first seeing this post, I legitimately had to stop and think as to what the rubber bands are used for, since I remembered they are included."
mflb,3dw2ph,marrio91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:05:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Instead of double wrapping a standard rubber band which most people do, I just use this. Keeps it tight, it helps since my lid has gotten a bit loose."

mflb,3dw2ph,Allanthia420,2,Mon Jul 20 01:48:08 2015 UTC,"To be honest I just threw a travel elastic in the cart when I ordered my Bottle Rocket, and I got 2 perfect sized rubber bands for 1.00 (I know 1.00 for 2 rubber bands is a rip off but whatever, they're perfectly sized.), and I really like to look of just one simple band around the box. No having to double wrap it or anything. Looks smooth and clean. Idk if you just hate the look of all rubber bands or if you were referring to the usual one that you have to double wrap haha"
mflb,3dw2ph,zombiepunch,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:23 2015 UTC,In a way. I don't really like the look of double wrapping a standard rubber band. This is actually pretty tight and it doesn't distract from the design of the box.
mflb,3dw2ph,DodgyBollocks,2,Mon Jul 20 04:17:49 2015 UTC,This. Thank you.
mflb,3dw2ph,slo_rider,2,Mon Jul 20 18:52:27 2015 UTC,Great idea! I buy those packs only for the teeny tiny ones in the top section (can't seem to find them sold separately) so I've got tons of the other two. Finally a good use for them!

mflb,3dybhh,Bfaymous,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. Will definitely check out the hardware store tubing. Ordering a new set would probably be best, but the hardware would be a quick, reliable fix"

Maybe your battery hole is looser?  I also don't like the button on the PA, but I read a tip on this sub that helped - put a battery cap on it. It makes it a bit more pleasant to push, but still not ideal.  I would love to see a button like the one on the Apex Vape. I never got to try it but people love these buttons ;)"
mflb,3dxq0h,defsubsucks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:48:44 2015 UTC,"You do realize that under that fancy marketing button CAP, is probably a pretty much identical to MFLB's ACTUAL micro switch."

mflb,3dxq0h,defsubsucks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:21 2015 UTC,"The ""problem"" OP has is that the actual switch is a piece of crap. The actual switching mechanism is identical in all microswitches, including this one."
mflb,3dxq0h,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:20:49 2015 UTC,"Actually his problem is that it hurts his fingers, which that cap would fix. Also the battery cap tip that I mentioned would.   Would it kill them to spend nine more cents on a button that does not actually hurt when using it. I find myself using different fingers for every inhale, holding the box like an idiot just to prevent my fingers from being sore."
mflb,3dxq0h,defsubsucks,2,Mon Jul 20 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"Spot on, going with the theme of the box, a nice piece of wood as the switch cap. I'm going to try the cap fix as soon as I actually find my caps I have never used them, I don't even have batteries for my box."
mflb,3dxq0h,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:05 2015 UTC,"A 9¢ per unit increase in materials, also increases production time and labor costs and is a huge amount in mass production. And yes, the MFLB is mass produced, but with a massive amount of hands on quality control between production steps."

mflb,3dxq0h,MissingJet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:12:25 2015 UTC,I'm going to argue about quality control with the PA lately. Customers have been receiving units without the dial being properly 'dotted' and that seems like something that should be pretty easy to spot... Other than that MF 's QC has always been great.
mflb,3dxq0h,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"As  with the mass produced,  cheap microswitches, the mass produced carbon film potentiometers are bought in lots of thousands for manufacturers. It's likely the pot manufacturer's QC is the culprit here, and they are often not returnable without restocking fees. If you're worried about a few cents here and there, as all device manufacturers are, you do not want to pay restocking fees over something so trivial.    It is not warrantable because it does not affect device function."
mflb,3dxq0h,MissingJet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:19:14 2015 UTC,Mine is fine it was just an observation. Falls on MF though.
mflb,3dxq0h,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"No, not in this case. What you say is true if the price was lowered, a 9¢ increase on a $79.99 product is nothing the profit margins are so large that it does not matter. Also not true is labor costs and production time since they don't make the switch themselves they buy them, so that's the manufacturers problem."
mflb,3dxq0h,Bathingintacos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:17 2015 UTC,"$79.99 is MSRP, not cost. A 9¢ MSRP increase is not the same as a 9¢ cost of production increase.    The additional labor and time costs are still added to that 9¢, because there is new labor involved in attaching the new item (wherever manufactured), which also adds time to the overall process. There will also be added R&D costs to attach this item to an already cost effective and functional device, which also has many of their own tests and costs. Which are ultimately also passed on to the consumer.    You must approach this from the bottom line of a manufacturer's business model."
mflb,3dxq0h,Bathingintacos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:18 2015 UTC,"But I was talking about the profit margin, so while $79.99 is not accurate, profit-margin speaking you only need to take away what retailers make and compare that number to 9¢ to see how much you are losing.  Whatever you do for PA 3.0 is going to take research and development, they are going to spend the same resources fixing a 1¢ or a 9¢ switch. The only way those costs would not apply is if you didn't change the design at all which is silly considering it's a new version (unless you are apple).  Also, can we just agree that compared to other costs of manufacturing this is a small amount of money? We know magic flight makes a lot of money per unit since all of the components are cheap and not exactly high tech. The reason why they can sell at such a price is that the products feel well made and premium, the wood the finish. With a design policy like that why would they care so much about a 9¢ difference. It might even be less than 9¢ all it takes is a cap. If you showed an ergonomics engineer this he would laugh. It is objectively worse than without any cover or a better button. What other premium device uses bare switches like this? Where else did you see MF cut corners like this it's not their policy.  I get why they did it, yes it's cheap, but you really think they couldn't make an incredible, beautiful, tactile button for something premium feeling it wouldn't cost more than a dollar or two, and for that is a shitload of money for a switch and then just charge $5 more for the PA? Seems like much more in line with their design and it's not like people buying their products care too much for price (I'm looking at you finishing grinder, water pipe whip)"
mflb,3dxq0h,texag93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"I would be satisfied with a cap, my problem was that as it is it's bad. A cap, a better switch, I don't mind, just make it better, these things are not supposed to be used bare-boned except for rare exceptions.  My problem is worse than other people since my PA does not maintain contact with the + - if i don't press it in hard. So I'm not just pushing the button in I have to push the entire battery end of the adapter in hard just for it to be in contact with the electrodes."
mflb,3dxq0h,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:31:38 2015 UTC,"You know the 'wire' thing which holds the lid in place? Well there's a gap next to it, push a penny in there and it'll tighten the hole for the battery piece.  I find the button isn't hard to press at all, I use it all the time and don't get any marks or anything from using it!"
mflb,3dxq0h,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:16:05 2015 UTC,"How much force did you apply, I fixed the box, tried with a penny, didn't move, tried a flat head screwdriver and a lot of force for it to move about 2mm before springing back in the original position. How did you manage to bend it?  It's not hard to press, but that does not make it any less bad. How can we be OK with a 1c button on a product that costs $70+ I can understand the price if quality components are used but the button is crap. These micro switches are not designed to be used like this, they are supposed to have a cap on them which you push.  Would you really not prefer a ""normal"" pushbutton, something as tactile as a mechanical keyboard, with more surface area? The form factor needs not to change just use a decent button."
mflb,3dxq0h,TLSOK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:27:35 2015 UTC,"Quite a bit of pressure, it depends on your box, some can use little force and it'll move a bit, but some may take a lot more force! Why don't you email magic flight? They love constructive criticism as we are the consumers, people like me and you are the people that buy their products and they want us to have the best products!"
mflb,3dxq0h,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:29:53 2015 UTC,I think one reason it's not as easy to push is that it would increase accidental activations. Better to press a little harder than accidentally burn a trench when you set the box down on the couch or something.
mflb,3dxq0h,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:31 2015 UTC,"The buttons you rant about are standard component buttons used in most every microelectronic device in existence, The caps you say are required for proper use and life expectancy, are nothing more than a physical GUI. They make them pretty and easy to use for fat human fingers, but offer no physical, switching actuation protection. That little domed copper disk is going to click back and forth exactly the same way whether it's ""protected by prettiness"", or not.    As for your battery plug pushing out, mine both do that as well, but the banana plug is shaped so the negative contact area remains full, even when it is pushed back out, because of the spring loaded + nipple tip. The + stays in contact even when it is slid out to the max by the tip, as does the negative contact.    The lengths of all spring actions are taken into account when creating and placing the contact areas of the plug's banana blades.    I understand you are not happy, but many others belie your qualms. Perhaps it's in (wait for it), your PA technique.    Sorry you're disatisfied, I'm not."
mflb,3dxq0h,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:18:10 2015 UTC,"I realize that they are nearly everywhere, I was talking about the button as a whole, usually it's covered with a cap, its not covered with a cap here so the ""push detecting mechanism"" (for lack of a better term) on the PA is bad. If a device has one pushable input that input better be good. I would be happy with a cap and this switch but there is no cap so I'm not happy. But keep in mind that for me the problem is worse than for most people since I have to push harder for contact.  From the posts in this thread I established that something must be wrong with my PA (this is the second one I got from MF, first one was DOA). You said:    As for your battery plug pushing out, mine both do that as well, but the banana plug is shaped so the negative contact area remains full, even when it is pushed back out, because of the spring loaded + nipple tip. The + stays in contact even when it is slid out to the max by the tip, as does the negative contact.    Negative is always in contact but the + is not, I tried this experiment now: PA in all the way, just to test push button to see it work, release, push button again. It takes less than a second for the PA to stop working, it just slips out and no light. The technique is fine, I have tried just about every single way to use the MFLB, I own this thing for more than a year and a half.  Do you have the newer version with the metal reinforcements or the older one?"
mflb,3dxq0h,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:27:08 2015 UTC,"I have the original version of the PAv2. I would suggest contacting MFLB (not warranty just yet), and explain your problem (s). They may have better workarounds, and if not they will just warranty you a new PA."
mflb,3dxq0h,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:24 2015 UTC,"Yes the button is way too small. Had never heard of the battery cap suggestion. That helps a bit. Still pressing on a tiny button through the plastic - shouldn't there be a finger-tip sized cap on the end of that button? (and just now thinking about maybe putting some kind of disc in the battery cap, so you would be pressing on a wider surface - something to experiment with).  And why can't there be some kind of marking on the dial? That is ridiculous! I marked mine with some white-out, and that pretty much solves that problem. Buy why did I have to be annoyed and confused about that and then add the marking myself? (I came here and researched it and tried some other things I had around here since I didn't have white-out, and then had to go buy some).  I love the MFLB. Hopefully they will make some improvements to the PA someday. (and I bet they will)  Having a way to replace the cover and/or the screen would be nice. (though I am not having trouble with either)."

mflb,3dtux7,compoundbreak791,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"That's annoying. I eventually waited until my old PA stopped working completely until I filed a warranty claim, although I regretted not doing it early. Something had happened to it that had made some of the rubber melt and go down into the spring which made the contact bent. I had to keep turning and rotating it to get it to work, not to mention the button stopped clicking. It was a long a battle but I had it for a decent amount of time so I couldn't really complain."

mflb,3dtwky,8bitsince86,2,Sun Jul 19 12:39:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe check the inside of the box where you insert the battery. The metal contact that the end of the battery touches should be in place for a good connection. The box itself is a simple design and you should be able to diagnose the problem by just examining it. Maybe take some pictures, but if the batteries and PA both don't work, it's probably the screen that is clogged or maybe the contacts."
mflb,3dtwky,compoundbreak791,2,Sun Jul 19 15:00:34 2015 UTC,"Would a dirty screen prevent the box from heating up? I guess it's possible and just a coincidence that the adapter went at the same time. I'll provide some pictures, although I'm not quite sure what would best show the problem.  http://i.imgur.com/18406xv.jpg  PS: Do you happen to know if the green power adapter light comes on when its not connected to the mflb?   EDIT: So I ended up cleaning the screen a bit and then trying out a battery that I left charging overnight. Surprisingly, it worked. Huh... But the power adapter still didn't work. I ended up finding another wall plug end of the power cable that had the same exactly specs as the power adapter, minus the light (not sure what the hell it belongs too).

mflb,3dt1fb,AFSPM,4,Sun Jul 19 04:25:20 2015 UTC,I would highly recommend you buy it from Puffitup.com or Magic-Flight since sites that sell it for under the MSRP aren't authorized dealers and Magic-Flight will most likely not honor the warranty. See this post for more information on the subject. Basically Magic-Flight started cracking down on their products being sold cheaper than the MSRP.
mflb,3dt1fb,compoundbreak791,2,Sun Jul 19 05:02:36 2015 UTC,"They don't track serial numbers (or they'd know who these distributors are who are supplying Massdrop, eBay, etc,) so how are they going to know you didn't buy it from an authorized reseller, or your cousin Frank?  They can plead or use scare tactics all they want, but a Lifetime Warranty is a Lifetime Warranty when they don't ask for a receipt.  In fact, they say directly that they'll still honor the warranty if bought from an unauthorized dealer.  shrug"
mflb,3dt1fb,mfskarphedin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:33:21 2015 UTC,"I thought they did track serial numbers so they could stop selling to the unauthorized dealers.

mflb,3dt1fb,compoundbreak791,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, maybe they do ask for a receipt (I haven't gone through the process,) but they said they will still honor the warranty.  And if they are tracking serial numbers...I guess they're not implementing it well.  A simple computer database could say box x1x2x3x4x5x made out of whatever wood went to Vapor Wholesales , who then sold it in a lot of 200 to Puff-o-Rama, based in California.  That was sold to a customer on whatever date, for example.  And then there are the resales; they don't mention that that I saw in any document.  ""Hey, I got it off a guy I work with who says he bought it online from your store, but he doesn't work here anymore, and I can't contact him, but here's a legitimate serial number,"" which they could then track to the authorized reseller headshop in their town.  Dunno, just saying that asking nicely will get some people to comply, but so many people are already into the MFLB for primarily the low price, so they're going to get it as cheaply as they can no matter what the company asks.  And hey, they're still making money!  It's just that their authorized dealers are making less..."
mflb,3dt1fb,mfskarphedin,2,Sun Jul 19 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"Well I guess if you're really tight on money and it's your only option, although I find the MSRP to be a fair price considering it is a lifetime warranty and all."

Massdrop sometimes has them a tiny bit cheaper, but then they always add shipping, while eBay sellers usually have free shipping.  So, all in all, it's a toss-up.  But I gotta say that Puffitup.com does add a lot of goodies to the standard package, though, which might make it worth it even to someone on a tight budget.  If they had a package with a whip and a finishing grinder for $119, I'd go for it there!"

Yours has a setting for it and can auto detect and change the settings according to the batteries.    But that being said check the manual and make sure that the settings are correct.
mflb,3drpi9,awex14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:48:18 2015 UTC,Also on the note of over charging you can do that on purpose and get it up to 1.6-1.7 and have it pack more of a charge.   This will make the life of them degrade faster but it is pretty normal practice on any batteries used in vaping. Standard is 3.7v but they are almost always charged up to 4.2v.
mflb,3drpi9,DuezExMachina,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:51:28 2015 UTC,You can use that. I use the non digital version for mine and it works great. Don't charge them at the same time as Lithium batteries. I think it detects it and switches the whole charger. Only nickel or only Lithium at one time.

mflb,3drhox,canofyamm,3,Sat Jul 18 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"I use mine in my room a lot and it doesn't smell like pot at all. Since the MFLB is an on demand vape it smells considerably less than something like my arizer air, which I don't dare use inside. If you had a candle lit and maybe a window open or a fan on you should be good. Remember that if you take smaller hits or hold larger hits in longer you won't be exhaling as much vapor, so that will help decrease any smell a lot. I always try to ghost my gits. Lastly its always a good idea to use a sploof"
mflb,3drhox,RumpleForeskin1013,2,Sat Jul 18 19:44:28 2015 UTC,Lol I knew what a sploof was. What does it smell like when you use it though? I'm waiting until I get home from Colorado to order mine.
mflb,3drhox,RumpleForeskin1013,0,Sat Jul 18 20:06:37 2015 UTC,"Well I always aim for no smell, which can pretty much be accomplished when ghosting hits or using a sploof. But I have heard that the smell of vapor is much more like how fresh bud smells rather than burned weed. It isn't nearly as strong and dissipates within a few minutes."
mflb,3drhox,frommaplesteeze,2,Sat Jul 18 20:32:56 2015 UTC,I honestly just take mine outside and just make sure I keep it in a smell proof container. I'm way too paranoid to ever try to use it inside. My dads the same way.

I had a semi new 1 foot bong I bought from a friend for $100 and he found it about 2-3 months later because I was careless. I'm needing to start trying toking indoors only because we moved to a small apartment and when I try and slip out the backdoor he either sees me or hears it open and he asks me where I'm going and it's always just too sketchy for me. I figured buying a mflb would maybe help and I could maybe sit inside my bathroom and toke for a few minuets saying ""I'm taking a dumb"" I used to do this with my bowl but it smelled too much even when I used a sploof and air wick, I even put dryer sheets inside of the vent that was on the floor and everytime my mother told me it smelled.

mflb,3drhox,KurroTheCat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:48:15 2015 UTC,To be honest I think more smell will come from your stash than the MFLB as long as you blow it out the window. Just pregrind and make sure your stash is safely stashed and then vape away.
mflb,3drhox,Josh___S,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:57:45 2015 UTC,Just open a window while vaping .. little to no smell BUT if you have window closed it will smell like weed in your room for sure so have a fan on or something the smell dicapates very quickly cause its vaper not smoke
mflb,3drhox,Klaupiaus,0,Mon Jul 20 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"I personally just use mine inside and blow it out the window. I've heard that some people mix their herb with tea or mint leaves to mask the smell. But what is an on demand vape? I think I know what it is based on what it sounds like, but what does it have to do with smell?"
mflb,3drhox,Dribblicus,2,Sat Jul 18 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"Basically on demand means the vape is only producing vapour when you want it to. The mflb is only ""on"" and producing vapour when you're holding the battery in. Whereas the airizer air is more of a session vape, which stays on in 10 minute cycles so it's always producing vapour during that time. Which means more smell."

mflb,3donzt,BestintheWest219,2,Sat Jul 18 00:07:38 2015 UTC,"There a couple ways to extract the oil. My favorite is pushing a small nug through so the nug gets covered in oil. Than you can put the nug in your pipe, bong, joint, etc and smoke that. You can also just soak the stem in a drink (commonly hot chocolate or liquor) and drink that. This works because the thc had already been activated when it was heated up and vaped. You can also put the stem in a tupperware or bowl of some sorts and soak it in ISO. When the ISO evaporates you should be left with the oil at the bottom of the bowl. Than you can dab this or even vape it if you have concentrate trays."

mflb,3donzt,Bfaymous,2,Sat Jul 18 05:37:08 2015 UTC,"Theoretically it would work but you shouldn't. Mostly because if you grind it than you will loose a lot of the oil and make the grinder really sticky.

mflb,3dkl3o,rhodesrunner,9,Fri Jul 17 00:52:38 2015 UTC,I'm just going to say this now...make sure you take off the glass stem before shaking your box.   Obvious right? Not when you're high.
mflb,3dkl3o,Pureststrainofevil,7,Fri Jul 17 04:02:56 2015 UTC,I keep my stem in the box all the time when ibuse it. Does it fall out sometimes?
mflb,3dkl3o,columbussss,4,Fri Jul 17 04:49:37 2015 UTC,"It can, and then you're a sad ent because you don't have a stem anymore :("
mflb,3dkl3o,DweebsUnited,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:07:05 2015 UTC,"FWIW I've never had it fall out on me when I shake it or rap it with my knuckles. Also, you can still get toasted without a stem.  edit:a letter"

mflb,3dm2cx,Bathingintacos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:32:22 2015 UTC,"Bought mine for that price from amazon, got the box verified too. So sounds real. There's got to be contact, so tight is best. I have to pull mine out too, nothing to worry about. There was a thread somewhere on here about the mflb official charger being speacial to these batteries and that's why they don't fully charge in other chargers (IIRC). I'll try and find it and link you :) Couldn't find it but found threads saying you can use any charger. It usually takes me about 4-5 hours to charge my batteries."
mflb,3dm2cx,imflb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:15:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the UK price as I live in the US, but as for the other two questions:  Battery fit actually is different for each unit because they are all handmade.  My unit has a relatively loose battery fit, and the plastic screen on top slides very easily.  My friend also has an MFLB and his is closer to what you are describing with everything being substantially tighter than my unit.  I've found that everyone has their own unique MFLB vaping habits based on the intricacies of their unit, so I'm sure that you will eventually adapt! As for the charging of the batteries, they take a very long time.  I know that wattage is different between the US / UK, but mine still take 8 + hours to charge to green.  You can always use the batteries before they are fully charged (I do this all the time) but that may have a negative impact on battery life, I'm not sure.  Try leaving them on overnight or perhaps invest in new batteries / the power adapter.  Good luck!"
mflb,3dig9v,nickolazx,9,Thu Jul 16 15:11:32 2015 UTC,I have one of these too!  I found it at a flea market.  When i scoop weed into my MFLB now I make airplane noises lol

I upgraded a few months ago from the stock batteries that were available a few years back, and they're really powerful and last me about 3-4 decent trenches, at around 4 microsipping pulls per trench before full extraction. But anyway, I hear they deliver a vape consistent with the PA?  Nice review though! Would you recommend the finishing grinder? I've been using a shitty three piece I bought off Amazon a while back, and I usually just vape a little until the herb is dry, then rub it between my fingers. It just crumbles into a fine powder. This has been working pretty well for me, and I'm not sure if I should really bother spending £25+ on this grinder. Is it true it only works if the herb is super dry?"
mflb,3djws0,BIG_JUICY_TITTIEZ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"Yea, glyphs. I was getting 1 trench, 2 max per battery,  PA is so much better then these batteries.

mflb,3djdvv,Allanthia420,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:48:19 2015 UTC,Think of it this way. If you have a question about the mflb and need an answer do you really want to post it to a sub that's just pumping out pictures so fast your question gets buried? Or would you rather post it to a sub dedicated to answering your questions?

mflb,3djexj,BasedPolarBear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"like also i read somewhere that u are supposed to use the mflb to like 80% lung capacirty then fill ur lungs for the rest with air and then breath out 20% capacity and take in 20% air and continue doing this until all the vapor is gone, does this work?   is all vapor that is 100% used to get you higher (ie perfect vaping) absorbed or can the vapor be used to 100% of its capacity and even when u blow out u see no vapor?"
mflb,3djexj,D1STURBED36,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"Your probably not grinding enough, hold the grinder upside down.  Stop worrying about maximum efficiency like that, hold your hit for 5~ seconds and start exhaling, if there is significant vapor (ie, not a small wisp, you should see the vapor curl in the air if its a lot) take another breath in and hold for 2-3 seconds.  Your most likely not cooking your weed enough, this goes with a fine grind as well. Make sure material is on the darker end of brown for a good extraction."
mflb,3djexj,D1STURBED36,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:09:41 2015 UTC,should it be any bit black? mine always end up as a mix of green and black
mflb,3djexj,Cloud_Motion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:10:56 2015 UTC,"A mix of green and black means that your grind is not fine enough. Some bits of black are harmless, but you should aim to just brown it."
mflb,3diyqk,Syed888,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"Should be alright. Likely to run out rather quickly though, even when not in use.   I'd recommend the glyph batteries from the MFLB website for like £11, if your box isn't a newer version.  They're specifically designed by MF to hold charge for a long time, hold a high amount of charge, and deliver a great vape."
mflb,3diyqk,Cloud_Motion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:50:49 2015 UTC,very bad .. lol the stock mflb batterys are 2500 mah . The ones they reccomend are 2700 mah
mflb,3dixjs,Allanthia420,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:19:09 2015 UTC,Orbiter on the inside. I usually use batteries and a dart stem to do mine outside. The trick is to put smaller loads and not cherry the tray while hitting it. The temperature of the MD is in the 300-700 range while the dab is vaped but shoots up once it's gone (making the MD super harsh).
mflb,3dixjs,ADHDABE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"Decrease the amount of oil you're using or stop inhaling once the oil is completely vaporized. I let the screen cherry after each hit to help keep the screen clean, but the heat can be unpleasant to the throat if you inhale while the screen is at its hottest. I use mine with the power adapter and Orbiter, and it can still be harsh depending on the strength and amount of concentrate I'm using."
mflb,3dlmae,tinyphilosopher,2,Fri Jul 17 07:06:20 2015 UTC,How is the bottle rocket?
mflb,3dlmae,Bathingintacos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:18:41 2015 UTC,"Hard to say, really, yet, as far as efficiency, because I have a feeling it cashes the trench in fewer hits, but the bong part is certainly nice. It removes the feeling like shit element of having it too hard on your throat from native mode and you can get some pretty impressive stacks in a similar way but with the bubbler so that's cool."
mflb,3dlmae,Bathingintacos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"I mean you're vaporising, that in itself is efficient as fuck, and if it takes 2 hits, that just means it's been 2 big as fuck hits.  Yeah, i imagine it's nice having it nice and cool!"

mflb,3dhb79,Bathingintacos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:44:04 2015 UTC,Yeah you can go higher or lower than a regular battery and it'll stay that temp. I usually just keep mine on 50% and leave it there!

mflb,3ddwlr,b3ttyrocks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:23:13 2015 UTC,"Do you think the nano grinder isn't enough?  I'm thinking about a portable setup.  I don't want to haul around a stash box, finishing grinder, launch box, stem, and battery just to chill in the woods.  I'm guessing I can skip a few of the items and just have a LB, film canister of pre-ground weed, and battery.  Anyone else do that?"
mflb,3ddwlr,nCubed21,2,Wed Jul 15 23:47:27 2015 UTC,"the idea behind the finishing grinder is that it turns the weed into this very light, powdery consistency.   this results in higher surface area and a better vaping experience.  this is no reason you can't use the finishing grinder and store that weed in your film canister. you do not NEED to finishing grind directly into the trench.  tl/dr: nano is fine, finishing grinder is excellent. you do not need to carry it around."

mflb,3ddwlr,b3ttyrocks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I think you're saying the finishing grinder gives you a finer grind than the nano, and that that kind of grind is better for vaping.  Is the method to start the grinding with something like the nano, then finish it off with the finishing grinder?  Or can you grind straight from bud to fine with only the finishing grinder?"
mflb,3ddwlr,do-un-to,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:45:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly! You should definitely pregrind with nano before using the finishing grinder. You won't have an easy time breaking down bud with only the FG. It's possible to break it down enough with your fingers and then use the FG, but life is so much easier with another grinder.

mflb,3ddwlr,b3ttyrocks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:55:38 2015 UTC,Do you think I'd be able to find a single grinder for all my needs?  Or do you think it makes more sense to try to get a 4 piece and then use the finisher on what comes out?
mflb,3ddwlr,Mercurial_Illusion,2,Thu Jul 16 20:40:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any grinder than can do both jobs. Some people suggest that turning a 4 piece grinder upside down and grinding for a minute or two can yield similar results. I haven't done that before, it gums up my grinder (cheap 4 piece).  TBH, you don't even need a 4 piece, the nano is fine. I only suggested the 4 piece because I like to collect kief. :P"

mflb,3df0f7,ajcool44,5,Wed Jul 15 19:27:09 2015 UTC,"For me personally, I would first remove the black ring inside the box which pushes the battery back out of the box after engaging power. It's easier for me because I don't have to constantly press battery against the ring to heat up the box and I can pull it out every time I'm finished with my hit. You can hit the box without the stem natively, but I prefer to use the stem. The more fine the grind the better, as it increases the surface area of your herbs to get the most out of them. Once you insert the battery, you will want to look down into the stem to see the red light. The light indicates the vaporizer is getting power and then you should see within seconds, vapor start to form under the screen of the box. You can also look down into the box through the acrylic lid to see vapor form, and judge your hits and draws based on the vapor production. You will want to take very light hits, like you're sipping hot tea, in order to let the box retain some of its heat, assuming you are stacking your hits. Stacking hits involves hitting the box multiple times while the battery is engaged in order to achieve the most vapor in one breath. Honestly, the learning curve isn't that bad if you know how the box works. This sub has a ton of other related information involving the best ways to learn your own technique, just use the search bar!"
mflb,3df0f7,compoundbreak791,3,Wed Jul 15 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"If you are interested in getting more milky hits from the box, I would suggest the stacking method! It uses up the herb a little faster but imo you get hit with it a lot faster as well. You can look up mflbninja's guide on this sub. That's what I did and worked for me."

Idk about you but most the time my hands are oily or sweaty so that could be getting in your herb and mucking it up? I always just pinch a little between my fingers and sprinkle it into my trench.

It sound slike it could be your grind, 3 options to try and fix this:   Turn your grinder upside and grind for longer to make it more fine. Buy a nano grinder from mflb to get a fine grind. Once ground, stick the weed in a pill bottle with a coin and shake it to help break it down.   Just remember, you can never be too fine :)"

In other words  the herb doesnt cover the whole trench area.  Its  basically a slim line i sprinkle in middle of trench. Do you think that can cause cumbustion?
mflb,3de3a2,imflb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, the same amount of battery output is used regardless of how filled or empty the trench is. The heating element comes mainly from contact with the trench and then some from the heat let off. So the amount added shouldn't really effect how much you combust.  What technique are you using at the moment? e.g. do you use your stem? how long are you holding the batteries in for? whats your draw speed?"
mflb,3de3a2,imflb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:14:57 2015 UTC,I used to draw slow but the vapir got hot. So now i draw fast. Is that ok?  Do you HAVE to use a technique to vaporize it?  I inhale it like a pipe
mflb,3de3a2,flangler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:20:56 2015 UTC,"The technique I use (and I find stops combustion) is this:   Hold the battery in for 6 seconds (or until vapor starts to come up the pipe) Slowly inhale (like your sipping a hot cup of coffee or breathing in through a really small straw) for 6 seconds Disengage the battery and keep breathing in for 6 seconds.   The short time that the battery is enaged (12 seconds) should stop combustion, you control the temperature of the vapour by the speed of inhalation.  The faster you draw, the cooler it is."
mflb,3de3a2,stoneredd,2,Wed Jul 15 16:27:38 2015 UTC,Cut the end off of a Slurpee spoon straw; makes the perfect little scoop to transfer your material into the trench.  I've been using the same one for almost 2 yrs now and it didn't cost a thing.

Normally I just grind it in my regular grinder, then use a pick to carefully scoop it into the finishing grinder. It gives it that extra fine grind.   I heard that using your hands/fingers isn't a good idea as some of the THC is absorbed into your skin (doesn't give off any effects though). I don't like having sticky/smelly finger personally, but that's just my opinion. I don't know how true the skin thing is though."

mflb,3dcyc6,compoundbreak791,9,Wed Jul 15 19:14:30 2015 UTC,I think the main thing they need to improve is the screen.  If they could make a stronger screen or an easily replaceable one it would really help save money in regard to warranty claims and stuff.

mflb,3dfcco,Syed888,2,Wed Jul 15 20:49:02 2015 UTC,The MFLB will only combust if you let the trench get too hot regardless of grind. I've used bud ground with my fingers that didn't combust and I've used bud ground with the finishing grinder that did combust.  Use one the methods shown in the manual at first (or search r/mflb for draw techniques) to get a feel for using the box. Eventually you will be able to feel how hot the vapor is with your tongue and be able to adjust your draw from there.

mflb,3dfcco,smokinrollin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:47:09 2015 UTC,You're probably just getting way higher off the MFLB than you realize! It also vapes mostly THC (which vaporizes at lower temperatures) and not much of other cannabinoids such as CBD or CBN (because they vaporize at temps too high for the box). THC is more likely to cause panic attacks
mflb,3dcp3w,UltimateToa,3,Wed Jul 15 06:12:05 2015 UTC,"I've never owned a G Pen but I know friends who have them. They're great for portability and have a sleek look that most would assume is an E.Cig in public. The G Pen is great for spreading out concentrate over a few good hits.  The Maud Dib is like a mini rig that hits you in the face in one go. The little trench heats up very quickly and often gets red hot when using newly charged batteries. It's not as discreet as a G Pen, but I think it's an amazing little gadget that gets me to the same level that dab rigs can.   I tried the concentrate tray for a while and it worked pretty well. It's not bad for the price, especially if you have the power adapter instead of batteries. It just didn't quite cut it for me. I would keep going the G Pen route or fork out the money to get the Maud Dib.   I'm biased, but I love the Maud Dib. The only downside worth noting is needing to replace the screen that is removable. It will get gunked up over time, depending on the quality of concentrate your using, and need replacing. Other than that, it's an amazing piece."

mflb,3da1nh,TogeanIslands,6,Tue Jul 14 17:51:58 2015 UTC,For the box I like Aurora batteries more. Golden is still cool tho.
mflb,3da1nh,flavidhasslefloss,2,Tue Jul 14 18:45:52 2015 UTC,I am very much looking forward to a restocking of the auroras... it seems like they might have only been available for a few hours...
mflb,3da1nh,TogeanIslands,2,Tue Jul 14 19:04:58 2015 UTC,Do you have any pictures of the Aurora batteries?  I'm curious what they look like.  I've never heard of them prior to seeing your post.

mflb,3dclml,Chrp1,2,Wed Jul 15 05:32:57 2015 UTC,"You'll know when you combust and it becomes smoke you're inhaling.  You'll see the material burning in the trench.  Its not pleasant and if it hasn't happened to you, great!  The vapor alone can get quite hot - the box can reach 400-odd degrees, so thats why having a whip or connecting it to an orbiter help cool down the vapor."
mflb,3dclml,9delta9,2,Wed Jul 15 06:03:35 2015 UTC,"I would say that taste is the biggest tell. If it tastes ashy you have combusted. The burnt taste is usual when it gets pretty brown, but the ashy taste should give smoke away pretty easily."
mflb,3dclml,Toastdyogurt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:04:07 2015 UTC,"When you combust you will see an ""explosion"" of white smoke under the lid. Since there is not much oxygen in there (assuming you stop inhaling), it will go out pretty quickly. You will then find that some of the material is black. Something to avoid, but no big deal. It took awhile for me to realize that vapor is not smoke."
mflb,3dclml,TLSOK,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:58:40 2015 UTC,Would you be able to see this when using the box native?
mflb,3dclml,TLSOK,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:35:54 2015 UTC,"I have been using a couple of feet of plastic tubing (less than $1 from a hardware store) as a whip (and also running that into a bong, sometimes wet, sometimes dry, sometimes with ice). So I just now went and had a look. Looks like you can see the trench in native mode, but just barely. So you might miss that ""explosion"" of white smoke, but you would probably taste it and it will continue to burn and smoke for a few seconds after you stop inhaling and let it die out. I've always stopped immediately when combusting, but I think if you kept inhaling you would have a LOT of smoke and you would taste it, and you would find black material in the trench. I'm not sure that I ever combusted with batteries, but with the power adapter you have to be more careful. Its fun figuring all this out."
mflb,3dclml,americnleprchaun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"smoke is the result of combustion. If nothing is burning, it's not smoke."
mflb,3dclml,JesseBotwin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:49:06 2015 UTC,"Smoke is much more harsh, nothing like vapor. Its not the heat, its the feeling. When you exhale, the smell will be 100x stronger and will linger much longer. I've combusted once so far, and it was not pleasant at all. You might notice a cherry formed in the box as well. After, the box might give off an ashy taste for a while, almost like an uncleaned pipe would. You will know when you combust. Not to mention the herb comes out black instead of brown."
mflb,3dclml,nani_kore,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:53:52 2015 UTC,"When you combust, the glass fogs up way more and quicker. That's smoke.  Also, as you inhale, you'll be able to see a small area of heat (fire) within your material."
mflb,3dbyfa,Joykill69,3,Wed Jul 15 02:07:28 2015 UTC,"I would contact them here.   Go with the online store orders, they helped me out big time when I ordered new batteries and then that day lost the foam battery cushion from my box in the ocean. Emailed them seeing as ordering a new one would mean another 7$ for shipping, and they just threw one in with my batteries.   10/10 would email again."
mflb,3dbyfa,rwzephyr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"I emailed them once about something like this, and I was informed (possibly by Elsa) that generally they don't do this kind of thing, unfortunately."
mflb,3dbco5,Slithersnail,6,Tue Jul 14 23:17:50 2015 UTC,"Don't get caught up in worrying about specifically how many hits you take, how long you inhale, amount of visible vapor, etc. The only thing that matters is that you start with a fine grind that's green and end with it looking evenly light to dark brown. Just be sure to shake it well between hits and don't hold the battery down long enough to burn it which is very obvious when it happens.   If you're worried about your grind just take a couple hits so that it ends up being brittle enough to crush between your fingers into a powder.   Don't be afraid to attempt to burn a trench if you haven't experienced that yet because it will give you a good idea of where that combustion point is and it won't do any damage to your box besides some mild and temporary discoloration.  In my experience it helps to not make a full seal around the stem with your mouth. Allowing for some extra air intake seems to help draw the vapor out. Play around with this and your draw speed.  The trench holds about .1 to .2ish grams"
mflb,3dbco5,Manwise,3,Tue Jul 14 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"In my experience it helps to not make a full seal around the stem with your mouth.     That's a good tip, I'd never really thought about that before. Sometimes it seems like the vapor just sits there if you watch it and other times you can see it moving down the stem. Anyways, thanks."
mflb,3dbco5,1blip,2,Wed Jul 15 03:18:15 2015 UTC,"I've had about the same experience as you, including the same draw technique. I've had my mflb for 2 months. I can't say I've been more than a [6].  Currently at a [3]. I have the PA and just got the Bottle Rocket."
mflb,3dbco5,_ELAP_,3,Wed Jul 15 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"Like Manwise said, Make sure you don't make a full seal. Only sip at it, like you would with really hot tea/coffee. I've only used for my MFLB for a few days now, but I find that I get super high by taking little sips instead of huge hits."
mflb,3dbco5,JesseBotwin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:05:29 2015 UTC,"When was the last time you really cleaned your trench out good with ISO? Mine was being kinda meh for a week till I gave it a good cleaning. Word of advice, if you use q-tips try not to scrub, the fibers can get caught on the screen and tear it.   If you are unsure of how well you cleaned it, before you start shine a light in through the draw hole (without the stem) to see how much gunk is on your screen. Give it a good cleaning and shine the light again to see your progress.  I can't recommend it enough but get the finishing grinder, takes you to that next level easily.  Lastly, make sure you are holding the battery in long enough, I find myself getting too comfortable and eager and start drawing too early."

mflb,3d9mmd,9delta9,2,Tue Jul 14 22:43:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have a good case for a refund, hopefully you didn't use the unit.  A store selling fake as genuine should be reported to MF HQ after they've given you the refund.   How did it go, /u/bolt_snap_bolt ?"

mflb,3d9mmd,defsubsucks,2,Wed Jul 15 11:39:11 2015 UTC,"I think you should mail Magic Flight and give them all the details. They would love to know about a store that sells fakes, knowingly lies about it and refuses refund when confronted.  Mail MF and let them know, they could help you out with dealing with the store and with getting an actual MFLB.  Edit: Also, I'd post all the details online. They knowingly ripped you off - fuck them, warn others."

Of course, IST is free to moderate their sub however they like, but it does feel clinical and the fact that this post has been downvoted for what is essentially constructive criticism is disheartening."

mflb,3d564g,ForScale,16,Mon Jul 13 16:41:33 2015 UTC,I have an idea A GREAT idea . okay its an alright idea.  You can make an MFLB simulator for rookies who dont know how to use the mflb. You can have the herb in the trench and then have them engange the battery for x amount of seconds and sometimes click the draw button but if they mess up the flow it can be like COMBUSTION or something lol and spark up idk something to teach noobs how to keep it properly heated. or how long to engage the battery without combusting you know  edit: or a HOW IT WORKS thing for maybe the mflb website!
mflb,3d564g,KurroTheCat,12,Mon Jul 13 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"Yes!! That is a great idea! It could be like a little game that teaches a person how to use the lb!  Great idea, man! Thanks!!   And feel free to play around with the code; copy and paste it and use it however you want, if you want!"
mflb,3d564g,Foul_Actually,5,Mon Jul 13 17:21:41 2015 UTC,Would love any and all feedback!  I plan to add in a way to put herb in it and have a some vapor stream out the front.   Other suggestions?
mflb,3d564g,ShaquilleOHeal,3,Mon Jul 13 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"What method are you using to teach yourself? Tutorials, Lynda, team treehouse, codecademy?"
mflb,3d564g,ShaquilleOHeal,3,Mon Jul 13 20:42:18 2015 UTC,Hey!  I started with Codecademy and then went on to use Sololearn. I also picked up a For Dummies book and I've read a little bit of Eloquent Javascript. I did a little bit on Khan Academy and Codewars. Other than that I just frequent html/css/js subreddits and try to soak up as much info as I can! I try to help people out with their questions and learn in the process.
mflb,3d564g,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:10:57 2015 UTC,Only feedback I have is to adjust the aesthetics of the lid to make it completely translucent to not affect the color of the wood. Cool so far though!
mflb,3d564g,rlaitinen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:46:03 2015 UTC,How's this? https://jsfiddle.net/bheLrg4x/
mflb,3d564g,rlaitinen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:32:41 2015 UTC,"Perfect. Also, you can make the logo black and a little bigger to fit the lb's look"
mflb,3d564g,rlaitinen,2,Tue Jul 14 23:38:41 2015 UTC,"See... I couldn't find a good pic of the wood burned logo anywhere...   I could crop one out of just a regular mflb pic, I suppose. But I also kind of like the one I went with since it's somewhat unique that no actual lb has one like that."
mflb,3d564g,KurroTheCat,3,Wed Jul 15 00:05:19 2015 UTC,"This would be a wonderful unlock wallpaper for a phone. Slide to ""unlock""/open the lid, then tap a code on the chamber. Maybe incorporate a swish in the sequence using the phones accelerometer.    slide-tap-tap-swish-swish-tap-tap-tap    If you can unlock my phone, i'll give you a hit,"
mflb,3d564g,KurroTheCat,5,Mon Jul 13 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"Haha! Perfect!  I'm still kind of a noob/intermediate when it comes to web dev. I'm not great with mobile...  But yeah, I like those ideas! Thanks!"
mflb,3d564g,itisnotmybirthday,3,Mon Jul 13 17:01:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool, but why is the battery on the wrong side?"
mflb,3d564g,itisnotmybirthday,5,Mon Jul 13 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"Wait... Dammit, you're right! Give me a few minutes here..."
mflb,3d564g,itisnotmybirthday,3,Mon Jul 13 18:09:44 2015 UTC,Okay! How about now?
mflb,3d564g,itisnotmybirthday,3,Mon Jul 13 18:17:37 2015 UTC,Very nice! :)
mflb,3d564g,itisnotmybirthday,3,Mon Jul 13 18:22:24 2015 UTC,Thank you! I just added some vapor to it... gotta hold the batt in for about a second. :)

Wish I was half as good as you .. did you use codecademy or what did you learn with .. this is impressive  edit: sounds sarcastic Im serious . this is hard code for me"
mflb,3d564g,ADHDABE,3,Mon Jul 13 16:50:50 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks!!  Yep, started with Codecademy and went on to use Sololearn... messed around with Coderbyte once I got decent with javascript.

Feel free to message me whenever you have web dev questions!"
mflb,3d564g,ADHDABE,3,Mon Jul 13 17:00:25 2015 UTC,Just uh.. one question lol .. I did the full CSS course on codecademy but I didnt fully understand the language like I do HTML so any reccomended CSS places to learn? like any CSS tutorial websites or vids that helped you?
mflb,3d564g,ADHDABE,3,Mon Jul 13 17:04:37 2015 UTC,Yeah! I found this one to be a nice add on to Codecademy: http://www.sololearn.com/Course/CSS/
mflb,3d564g,BirdMachine69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:19:50 2015 UTC,"Check out Free Code Camp. You'll learn everything from html and css to javascript, jQuery, and full stack development. They have non-profit charity work you can so to work on your skills and many people have gotten jobs from finishing the curriculum. I'm not associated with them in anyway, but it's what I used and its pretty good."
mflb,3d564g,RogerBunkleFunk,2,Mon Jul 13 18:54:36 2015 UTC,jQuery would make the code much cleaner. I rewrote the javascript here on my codepen. Edit: Did this before you added vapor. I can add the vapor to my rewrite in jQuery if you would like?
mflb,3d4qn2,KurroTheCat,13,Mon Jul 13 14:45:10 2015 UTC,I assume most people are baked when posting.. I just end up deleting my response for being overly articulate and probably off topic.
mflb,3d4qn2,baatler,17,Mon Jul 13 16:22:27 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. This sub should be open to people posting their experiences with the mflb, their love for it, questions about it, and basically anything to do with the mflb. We're all sharing the fact that we enjoy the same product, and should be fine to post about our experiences."
mflb,3d4qn2,lsdood,0,Mon Jul 13 14:48:53 2015 UTC,thats what /r/lbregs is for this is an information sub.
mflb,3d4qn2,Lexx4,6,Mon Jul 13 22:35:11 2015 UTC,"I've been browsing this sub for almost 8 months but only found out about /r/lbregs a week or two ago. I think /r/mflb should allow more discussion, photos etc. just for the fact that I don't think this community is active enough to warrant a sister sub.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice idea to separate casual posts vs questions/tips but /r/mflb should be about anything related the MFLB, not just an informational subreddit. Its boring, and I wish I would've known about /r/lbregs sooner."
mflb,3d4qn2,PissedInYourCheerios,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:44:08 2015 UTC,"I've been on here for over a year and left because I couldn't stand IST and because of bullshit like this.   It's a weed subreddit. It should be relaxed. It's so obnoxious posting something and having it deleted because ""hurr derr, this is an informational subreddit!""  I've only recently come back because IST is away."
mflb,3d4qn2,Camellia_sinensis,-3,Tue Jul 14 14:54:16 2015 UTC,Well. I mean that's your own fault. You should have read the side bar.
mflb,3d4qn2,Lexx4,3,Mon Jul 13 23:49:23 2015 UTC,"Probably. I'm primarily a mobile user, and a large portion of reddits user base is too.  Still, despite lbregs being in the sidebar, I stand by my comment, this sub is not active enough for a sister sub. It's unnecessary clutter and overkill for an already small community."
mflb,3d4qn2,PissedInYourCheerios,-2,Tue Jul 14 00:04:53 2015 UTC,One is an information subreddit for beginners to come ask questions. The other is like the /r/trees for mflb. I don't see why people have a problem with this.
mflb,3d4qn2,Lexx4,0,Tue Jul 14 00:11:20 2015 UTC,Because it's an unnecessary separation and it's so nitpicky that it discourages people from coming here. That's why.
mflb,3d4qn2,Camellia_sinensis,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:55:00 2015 UTC,It's not hard. You want to post useless glamor shots of the same box over and over go to /r/lbregs you want information go to /r/mflb. Don't like it? Take it up with /u/I_Submit_This when he returns online.
mflb,3d4qn2,Lexx4,8,Tue Jul 14 15:52:28 2015 UTC,"IST (the only mod here... who disappeared) has a rule that this sub is supposed to be for informational purposes, geared towards newbies... no ""glamour"" shots.

mflb,3d4qn2,ForScale,4,Mon Jul 13 16:38:02 2015 UTC,What happened to that guy?
mflb,3d4qn2,torof,4,Mon Jul 13 18:01:15 2015 UTC,I haven't a clue. I know he's had internet issues in the past. I know he has some health issues.

mflb,3d4qn2,Camellia_sinensis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:09:56 2015 UTC,I wish the absolute best to him and much good health but this sub is better off with someone else to moderate it.

mflb,3d4qn2,Lexx4,0,Tue Jul 14 15:01:29 2015 UTC,I'm perfectly fine with that.
mflb,3d4qn2,Camellia_sinensis,12,Tue Jul 14 15:04:35 2015 UTC,"I think the community is small enough where we don't need two subreddits. Most questions can be found in the sidebar and searching.

mflb,3d4qn2,compoundbreak791,2,Tue Jul 14 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"This is something IST wanted, and is one of the many reasons why I made the recent post analyzing the results of having one person moderate a community of 22,000 MFLB owners; more people realizing the useless rules he enforces as being unrealistic/pragmatic means more likely that change will happen. A possible creation of /r/MagicFlight (as possibly supported by it's sole moderator before) could unite /r/MFLB and /r/lbregs"
mflb,3d4qn2,takaci,5,Tue Jul 14 04:52:25 2015 UTC,"A possible creation of /r/MagicFlight[1] (as possibly supported by it's sole moderator before) could unite /r/MFLB[2] and /r/lbregs[3]   If only there was a way to combine /r/mflb and /r/lbregs... I don't know, maybe it should be called a multi-reddit and be at /r/mflb+lbregs. Oh wow that works, cool, they should put it in the sidebar. Oh wait."
mflb,3d4qn2,ForScale,2,Tue Jul 14 11:40:20 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you. /r/lbregs is the perfect place for all these pictures hence why it was created in the first place. People come to /r/mlfb for questions or concerns about the vaporizer. And yes, I do want this board to be nothing but ""need help with this"" or ""warranty question"", because those are the things people come to this subreddit for. I'm not against all those stories and pictures, but there is a proper place for those posts and it's not a bad thing to politely tell those people that there is an appropriate place for them."

That, and discussion. For anything else (like pictures and stories) there's a sub, /r/lbregs, and that's what it's for.  This sub is for Q&A and discussion, and all those ""boring questions"" get buried under the pictures and stories. So new people don't get the help they need, but you guys get to see your pictures and stories here on /r/mflb instead of using /r/mflb+lbregs, the multireddit that allows you to see both subs at once, and solving this issue."
mflb,3d4qn2,PsychoKiller-fafafa,9,Mon Jul 13 15:53:43 2015 UTC,"Well not alot of people are going to see your comment  . This subbreddit is full of stoned people wanting to tell storys and have fun together , Let them do that and quit policing .. come on man were all friends here.  edit: I have been on the mflb sub for a year and a half now and have never heard of that other sub Think of it this way a guy at an [8] thinks "" Hey I want to go on r/mflb and chat with others about being stoned off this thing haha"" and proceeds to come here . not everyone knows about that so come on man leave these guys alone lol there just stoned havin fun"
mflb,3d4qn2,PsychoKiller-fafafa,3,Mon Jul 13 16:04:10 2015 UTC,"I do agree that the ""policing"" isn't fun and can make people annoyed, but I think it's a necessary evil in order to keep answering questions and having discussions.   If someone is stoned and makes his post here instead of the other sub, when they get told - they shouldn't get all insulted and hurt, they should just understand the rules (and the reasoning for them) and post it in the right subreddit.   By posting pictures and stories here, people are burying the relevant questions from new users (with votes). These questions may have been asked and answered 100 times, but that's what this subreddit is for, questions and discussion. In an ideal world people would use the search bar, but that's not happening for whatever reason, maybe reddit's search function isn't very good?  I love pictures and stories, but there's a different place for that. And I think that with the multireddit solution, there's no reason to post pictures and stories to a  Q&A/discussion subreddit.  You do have a valid claim - you didn't know of the other subreddit. If you've been on this sub for so long and this is the first you hear of it, then it's definitely worthwhile for us  the users to find a way to make that sub more visible and known. I know the mod /u/mflbninja has mentioned it too, that may just the sidebar isn't enough and we should put that info in the sticky. I think maybe even in the ""submit post"" page, some visible text about it.  And also we should push the multireddit solution more, I'm sure even less people know of that."
mflb,3d4qn2,PsychoKiller-fafafa,2,Mon Jul 13 16:37:55 2015 UTC,I get what your saying man thanks for showing me that subreddit Ill spread the word

mflb,3d4qn2,rlaitinen,5,Mon Jul 13 17:51:58 2015 UTC,well that was from the mod that everyone thought pushed people around and kinda ruined the sub.. and there was even a thread where everyone agreed on that and now I bring it up again everyones like HE WAS RIGHT GO TO THIS SUB Im like.. I just want everyone to be happy man

Also, /r/mflb is recommended by magic flight in the handbook as a help forum. It's a good setup, just post in the right sub. I really don't know why people still don't understand this."

It's a matter of preference obviously but I like that I don't have to deal with constant Q&A on /r/lbregs. It's like this is a help forum, /r/lbregs is the chill out spot. If someone posts the wrong thing in here, they're immediately referred to /r/lbregs. If you really want to see the subs together, and I'm not sure why you would since /r/mflb is just for questions, you could make a multireddit and its like they're the same subreddit. This is a pointless argument because people will be unhappy with either option."
mflb,3d7pck,KurroTheCat,2,Tue Jul 14 04:04:23 2015 UTC,btw you dont need much water at all in a mflBONG.  You just want to cover the area the vapor comes in.  You dont need to have a lot of water like you do with combustion.  You basically just need a whip or long stem to get the vapor from the box into the mflBONG and some way to inhale :)
mflb,3d7pck,9delta9,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:07:15 2015 UTC,You looking to make a waterfall bong? (Where the draw is made by water emptying from the bottle drawing in the vapour) or an actual bong that you suck on to draw in the vapour?
mflb,3d7pck,imflb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:39:06 2015 UTC,Actual
mflb,3d7pck,imflb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:58:51 2015 UTC,Have you got any water whips? Sorry about all the questions but it all depends on what you have to make one haha :)
mflb,3d7pck,imflb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:32:17 2015 UTC,all I have is my mflb ;_____;
mflb,3d7pck,PissedInYourCheerios,2,Tue Jul 14 21:26:04 2015 UTC,"without any water whips it would be really hard to make, becuase of the angle the box needs to be would allow water into the box too if directly attached.   If you want big hits, put your stem into a bottle filled with water (but not into the water) with a hole in its bottom. Then activate your box and allow the water to drain from the hole. Recover the hole about half way and shake your box and repeat. This should fill your water bottle with a big hit you can take at once :)"
mflb,3d81kf,CorruptHope,2,Tue Jul 14 06:05:49 2015 UTC,"A good tip: when you draw with your mouth over the straw end, position your mouth so you're inhaling half from the straw and half off - so you inhale both vapor and oxygen. This allows the vape to go deeper into your lungs and you get a better high. Honestly theres millions of techniques (probably not) just search 'techniques' in this subreddit and you'll find a whole bunch that will cater to you."
mflb,3d81kf,greasy_bacon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:30:33 2015 UTC,To be honest I got one that doesn't have a straw. Any tips for raw intake?
mflb,3d81kf,greasy_bacon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:56:16 2015 UTC,"fair enough try not to get any moisture on the wood (dry lips) because it gets soggy, gross and you will need to carve it out to not look gross. and after a while you'll whittle it into nothing. I like to personally hold the battery down for 20ish seconds and cover the end hole, and shake the box every maybe 5 seconds , and take a big fat inhale at the end. quickest way to use the box although some might argue it's not as efficient.    I've used a 3,3,3 technique (battery in for 3 seconds, inhale for 3, hold for 3, inhale for 3, hold for 3, inhale for 3, hold for 3, release battery and inhale yet again to clear the chamber.) Takes a while to get used to the big inhales but you'll get there."
mflb,3d81kf,greasy_bacon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:03:10 2015 UTC,Should I be holding the small hole on the other side too? I'd like to be efficient but being fast is pretty nice too.
mflb,3d81kf,KurroTheCat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:17:45 2015 UTC,"yeah look just had a go on my vaporizer and i realised i totally cooked what i said, heres some better tips: grind up your bud as much as possible; the more surface area the better for a technique i'd try holding in the battery for 3 seconds, inhale very slowly WHILE watching the vapor build up inside, and clear the chamber when it's a noticeable haze, let it build up again while inhaling and clearing totally. rinse and repeat. you should be able to do at least 2 rotations in one breath (this gives you an indicator of how slow to draw initially) sorry if this isnt making sense dude i vaped some kief"
mflb,3d7uxu,PuocoJoao,4,Tue Jul 14 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"With a more fine grind, you'll find that your trenches will toast more evenly. Although, your hits be more dense and thick, but this will also probably shorten the length of time it takes you to finish the trench. Basically you're maximizing the surface area of the herbs so the vape can get the most out of your medicine. I'd highly recommend the finishing grinder."
mflb,3d7uxu,compoundbreak791,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:20:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I know it's a ballpark, but approximately how fine does the finishing grinder get?"
mflb,3d7uxu,compoundbreak791,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:57:47 2015 UTC,Like a little less fine than if you were to use a coffee grinder.
mflb,3d7uxu,imflb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:38:39 2015 UTC,"Spot on! The more surface area exposed from the finer ground, the more contact is made between herb and the trench. This maximises battery usage as well as giving a more even vape throughout :)"
mflb,3d7uxu,LotsOfBacon78,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:35:22 2015 UTC,Definitely noticed the box worked better and was more efficient when i got the finishing grinder.  No other grinder I had was that fine.  It works extremely well for what it does.

I'd say put the request in (totally eligible) for a warranty replacement but the box will probably be useful for now. The year will likely get worse, though, and you'll need to wait for your replacement in the mail. Just pack the trench lightly for now (no more than half full) and you should be good until the replacement arrives,"

mflb,3d33sj,_dabnation_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:42:55 2015 UTC,Does it just make it easier to take bigger hits?
mflb,3d33sj,_dabnation_,2,Mon Jul 13 03:51:03 2015 UTC,Mmm in my opinion the best/biggest hits come from a med-low heat setting using the PA2.0 and loooong-heavy draws.    For me it seems that the filtration provided by the water just weakens the vapor's effects and marginally cools the vapor.
mflb,3d33sj,21TQKIFD48,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:57:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on the water pipe, but it's pretty hard to go wrong. The gist of it is that it cools and humidifies your vapor, and holds it in the water pipe as sort of a third lung. It takes some practice to learn what techniques you like, but it's the sort of thing that makes it pretty easy to down a trench in two or three hits."
mflb,3d33sj,aznsensation8,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:50:03 2015 UTC,No. Like most of MFLB products it's mostly aesthetics and branding. I would say the products with lifetime warranty is worth it tough. I got a box and a PA 2.0 and used the warranty at least twice for each item and the accessories are simple enough to make by just looking at a picture of it. Just go to your hardware store and buy some polyurethane tubing.

I'm confused...how can Magic Flight not be able to trace the source via the serial numbers, if they're real?  And if they're real but not from an authorized reseller, I don't think they will honor the warranty, according to that post.  Is ""Bob from Accounting"" palming 100 or so every month to dump for cheap on Massdrop or something?"

I'd advise getting ""0""anyway. Pop one and see how your tolerance is. Everyone is different. You can always pop 2 next time. Two gets me to a 7-8... One gets me to a very nice 4-5. Three gives me the fucking horrors dude. Pack them tight. Blend the ABV first in a mini coffee grinder into a fine powder. Trust me. If you have never eaten ABV before just go with one and wait 30 mins or so. Eat some food with it. Like a nice advocado and chicken sammich or something. The fat will help to ""bring it out"", but it is not needed really, it's just that I find if I eat ABV running empty, I wanna pig out like a tumblr at a fucking buffet after an hour haha.

mflb,3czjxs,ADHDABE,2,Sun Jul 12 05:28:47 2015 UTC,"As others have been saying, you are incorrect. It isn't resin, it is vapor that has condensed onto the inside of the stem. It has all of the cannabinoids that are in the vapor; so you will get high if you smoke, vape, or even eat it because the thc has been activated from the heating. But nobody really eats it plain, we will often soak it in coffee, hot chocolate, liquor, etcetera so that when we drink that we will get high."

mflb,3czjxs,ForScale,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:41:30 2015 UTC,As others have mentioned... it's indeed oil! It's just vapor (that has the good stuff in it) condensed down in to solid/liquid form as opposed to a gaseous vapor.  It's a really cool method for making oil that's a fantastic by product of the normal use of an mflb!  Resin is from smoke residue and is black and solid/gooey. It's a lot more than just condensed vapor.

mflb,3cu01l,Kensei22,10,Fri Jul 10 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"This post caught me completely off guard. I haven't browsed r/mflb for a long time, but have remained subscribed for years. All I can remember is how helpful he was in the early days, but I guess everyone can change"
mflb,3cu01l,deekaydubya,8,Sat Jul 11 04:48:26 2015 UTC,"He's the type of moderator who has conformed an incredibly huge community of people to his one way of thinking; he encourages people to discuss about the magic flight, just not on his subreddit, where he is the one and only rulemaker. His classic and constant strictness does prevent spam and double posts, but look at other subs like /r/Vaporents, where double posts exist but more meaningful discussion, debate, and inquiry is encouraged and is thriving. Without /u/I_Submit_This, we've been much more like /r/Vaporents in a purely positive way."
mflb,3cu01l,somanyroads,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"The comparison to our former CEO has no basis in reality, to be honest. I didn't like the long-winded mod posts but that was about it."

Personally, i dont subscribe to any other pot related subreddits because i really dont care for pictures of bud or bongs, etc. I just subscribe to this sub to learn how to best use my mflb, and am glad that the moderator doesnt allow karma grab pics of random shit. He may be a bit strict with some stuff but i dont really get all the hate on him."
mflb,3cu01l,Shattr,9,Sat Jul 11 01:58:00 2015 UTC,"My issue is this is really the official mflb 'forum'. This is easily the largest mflb community on the internet and the mflb team has been known to participate in conversations here as well as giveaways. To me, that says a lot and it's fantastic that we're able to interact with the people who make the device we're all so fond of.  A community like this shouldn't be subject to the opinions and rules of one random redditor. Sure /u/I_Submit_This created the sub, but does that really give him sole power over all the discussions that go on in the largest mflb community? If he was a member of the mflb team then it would be understandable, but he's just an enthusiast like the rest of us. It's obvious that he views this as his sub and not a sub for like-minded people, which is a problem. He simply just wants control and to hinder the discussion that the majority of us want to have.   The only reason this sub isn't dead is because people love the flight box. I've been a part of subs with mods who view their sub as their own personal website and those subs are now graveyards.   To /u/I_Submit_This : please take on additional moderators for this sub. If you want complete control over a webspace, create your own website. Just because you were the first to type in reddit.com/r/mflb and click 'create subreddit', doesn't make you the spokesman for this entire community. I appreciate how much work you've done for this sub, but we as mflb owners deserve a place where we can have the conversations we want. Creating splinter subs only fragments the community; this community is small enough as it is and we shouldn't have to split it up because of one man's unwillingness to change."

mflb,3cu01l,FlamingAssCactus,-1,Sun Jul 12 15:39:00 2015 UTC,"It's not one man's unwillingness to change. In the Flight Guide, reddit.com/r/MFLB is referred to as a place to go for help. It is not about a Magic Flight enthusiast community. It is a new user help forum. People, not unlike yourself, are trying to change /r/mflb into something it isn't.  You have your /r/lbregs for when you want to see memes and toke spots featuring the MFLB and whatever other stuff you normally find in /r/trees or /r/vaporents, with usually only vague Magic Flight connotation.  If you don't like it, go away."

mflb,3cu01l,sgentus,27,Sun Jul 12 04:26:16 2015 UTC,As someone from vaporents and not a mflb user I thought he was insanely annoying and made mflb users look bad. There's been worse community members but the frequency he posted with made it a daily issue.  He was right sometimes and I tried to give him credit when it was due... But the other posts.... Man.
mflb,3cu01l,KurroTheCat,6,Fri Jul 10 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"My point exactly; not only does his arrogance shine brightly in his posts, but his strictness shows in his moderation of what is essentially his subreddit, a place where open and thoughtful discussion is sent elsewhere"

He responded like HEY THERES A REASON YOU CAN ASK FOR HELP ON THIS SUBBREDDIT MAKE A THREAD. And I was like ...... okay  edit: I dont hate the guy I still respect him and thank him for all hes done here but he was a bit mean at times
mflb,3cu01l,mang3lo,11,Fri Jul 10 23:38:36 2015 UTC,The idea being that he (the mod) doesn't have to take time off his day to answer your question when you could have a better answer from multiple experienced people by posting it on the sub.   Imagine if you got that message over and over and over. After a while I know I'd start being frustrated. No issues with pming an experienced member but it's not cool to pm a subs only mod for an answer when there are other options.
mflb,3cu01l,CharlieTango,11,Sat Jul 11 02:48:38 2015 UTC,That guy rubbed me wrong a few times. Not even w personal interactions; of which I had only a few.  Just watching how he interacted w others

I think the most important thing is we try to keep the community healthy and awesome together now untill we hear more. Downvote stupid and negative posts like someone trying to sell stuff on here for example... I hope nothing bad happened to him, I recall him mentioning some health issues in one of his posts. So yeah, let's wait and see if we'll be updated, he might just have taken a long ass summer holiday :P"

I for one think he did a great job, yes he was strict of HIS sub, notice the emphasis of HIS it's his frigging subreddit he can do what he likes, if you're butt hurt just go make your own sub with blackjack and hookers. He always answered questions and was quick to help people out (Like me when i accidentally posted a screeshot of my serial number.)  I would not say that the sub has been better since he has stopped replying."

mflb,3cu01l,happyself,3,Fri Jul 10 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"People seem to have a hard time understanding what this subreddit is. That's not unreasonable, as it doesn't follow the usual template for a subreddit, but we need to keep in mind that this is an informational subreddit above all else. I don't doubt that the reason Magic-Flight endorses this subreddit is that it's moderated in a way that makes it a reliable resource for new users.  With IST's absences lately, though, it might be a good idea to establish at least one more moderator. I doubt that Magic-Flight wants to endorse a sub that often goes unmoderated for weeks at a time."

mflb,3cu01l,P3NGU1NSMACKER,6,Fri Jul 10 21:06:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if after all the recent posts like this bashing his mod style, he decided to go quiet for a month to see what sort of state this sub devolves into.  Even tho it seems like this opinion is in the minority, I personally think the standard of this sub has gone down slightly since IST disappeared- only a few hours ago I read a thread on here, with someone commenting 'OP is a tool'. It's pretty wack.  I agree sometimes ISTs mod style is a bit heavy, and also sometimes a bit hypocritical, but one thing I notice every time this issue is raised is this:  Like everyone states, if you don't like r/mflb or it's mod, there is the alternative of r/lbregs, which is a lot more lax on its submission rules. The fact is though, despite all the moaning etc, mflb still remains significantly busier than lbregs. Lbregs is pretty dead most of the time, which is funny considering the amount of people on here moaning about not allowing random non-informational posts... You'd think they'd be all over lbregs. But they're not.  Peace"
mflb,3cu01l,ADHDABE,6,Fri Jul 10 22:53:39 2015 UTC,I remember him saying he had a serious disease that puts him in a wheelchair and can't function well without weed. I wonder if it could be related to that?

mflb,3cu01l,ADHDABE,-2,Fri Jul 10 21:06:59 2015 UTC,Well if 22 days is almost  30 days you must be doing some rather strange rounding.....  It is summer. I wouldn't be surprised if I_S_T (like many others) was on some kind of vacation or traveling. 22 days is not particularly long in that context.
mflb,3cu01l,rlaitinen,6,Fri Jul 10 21:27:38 2015 UTC,I looked at his activity the other day and I could have sworn it said 27 when I checked so I just rounded up
mflb,3cu01l,xactoman,15,Fri Jul 10 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this whole deal. If you don't like how IST runs r/mflb, go to /r/lbregs or /r/vaporents or start your own sub. I never had a problem with IST and have seen zero improvement with him gone."
mflb,3cu01l,defsubsucks,8,Fri Jul 10 21:25:26 2015 UTC,I agree... he might have been a bit arrogant here and there but he had great information and delivered consistently.  If someone has a good example of him being a dick in a comment thread I'd like to see it.
mflb,3cu01l,rlaitinen,7,Fri Jul 10 22:01:54 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this whole deal. If you don't like how IST runs r/mflb , go to /r/lbregs or /r/vaporents   This is exactly what it boils down to. I realized this last time the topic was discussed. People are not willing to accept that this sub is only suitable for two types of posts: Q&A and discussion. Anything else LB related should go on /r/lbregs. This is an effective way to help new users and have discussions, otherwise these posts get buried under the image posts (because who upvotes the 593rd person to ask if batteries of brand X are suitable for the LB or how not to combust?).  But people just can't accept that. My only guess is that since there's less traffic there, they get less karma and comments for their posts. So instead of sticking around to generate that traffic and content they want, they fight to bring it here."
mflb,3cu01l,PsychoKiller-fafafa,4,Fri Jul 10 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're preaching to the choir. You actually make the same point I did the last time this subject came up in /r/lbregs. Which, coincidentally I'm sure, was also the last time anyone saw IST."
mflb,3cu01l,mflbninja,8,Fri Jul 10 22:54:22 2015 UTC,Right. Unfortunately Reddit loves witch hunts and the /r/vaporents community can be kinda toxic. Just typical Reddit drama lol.
mflb,3cu01l,LeConnor,10,Sat Jul 11 01:33:04 2015 UTC,I would like some corroboration for what you're claiming here. Can you provide links to a few threads that are good examples of these heightened levels of discussion? Or are you just here to instigate a witch hunt against a hard working mod?
mflb,3cu01l,LeConnor,20,Fri Jul 10 21:09:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that this shouldn't turn into a witchhunt, but IST has some off-putting moderating practices that ultimately work against the community, no matter the reason for their implementation.  He removes comments that reference some product without a link to the product (you need to scroll down a little) but he just tells people to search the sub instead of linking it himself.  He flat out refuses to allow a honey oil extraction guide in the sidebar despite the overwhelming response in favor of such a sidebar link. IST didn't offer a reason why he refuses to put a guide in the sidebar other than ""nobody reads the sidebar"", then said effectively said my way or the highway"".  The information he offers is extremely valuable, but IST's moderating practices often aren't conducive to fostering a friendly and informative environment."
mflb,3cu01l,rlaitinen,7,Fri Jul 10 21:34:20 2015 UTC,"All of the following except stuff in brackets is copypasted from a previous comment:  Why are the rules here so different [compared to other ent-related subs] though? It's not like MFLB users behave any worse than the rest of reddit, not to mention other vaping subreddits and the ent community at large.   When he says it's his sub, that means he's the sole moderator, the one who wrote the rules, and the one who will enforce them.   This is unfortunately not true.   in any moderated by rules sub, the sub is run as the top mod wants the sub to be run. such moderated subs are not run by the readers, they are run by the rules the top mod sets in place ... rules listed or not.  i have the rules posted very clearly, and they are followed to the letter ... every single one of them.   In that single post, IST says that all rules are listed clearly, but we're still subject to rules that he hasn't written down, and that the community does not and will not help run the sub.  Again, the /r/mflb community doesn't need more moderation than any of the other ent-subreddits. The only reason it might need different moderation is because someone wants the sub to be a certain way; strictly Q&A, for example. But most people, at least the people who are talking, want /r/mflb to have a broader variety of posts, like most other ent-related subs have."
mflb,3cu01l,PsychoKiller-fafafa,8,Fri Jul 10 22:43:33 2015 UTC,"But most people, at least the people who are talking, want /r/mflb[3] to have a broader variety of posts, like most other ent-related subs have.   And this sub already exists. It's called /r/rlbregs and is linked in the sidebar for everyone and their mother to see. IST started this sub a certain way, and he plans to keep it this way. And I'm all for it. This sub is all that keeps /r/lbregs from cluttered up with the 999th new user comment."
mflb,3cu01l,LeConnor,4,Fri Jul 10 22:56:06 2015 UTC,"YES. Thank you. I'd rather not see ""hey cn I put AA batries in my lunch box?"" every other day alongside the good content."

He flat out refuses to allow a honey oil extraction guide in the sidebar   What? He won't allow information that has nothing to do with what this sub is all about allowed in the sub? How fucked up that is!     said my way or the highway   How fucking dare he dictate the rules of the sub he created! Damn him!

With the lid open, engage the battery for 30 - 60 seconds (this will burn off any materials still in the trench and evaporate the iso so you won't inhale it) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the q tips aren't collecting any more residue.   Combustion is a normal part of learning how to use the launch box. In this case, you probably left the battery engaged too long. Search mflb for ""666 method"".

mflb,3crlr3,TheDeepDarkDerp,2,Fri Jul 10 06:05:38 2015 UTC,Same. Just blow it out the window. I've been doing it for a good while and had no comment what so ever on the smell. Nor do I smell it myself. Buddy jr would be over killing it but is safer to only a small degree if you have a window.
mflb,3crlr3,fruitysaladpants,6,Fri Jul 10 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, this will almost certainly keep the smell from leaving your room, and any smell from it in your room should dissipate very quickly. However, make sure to get plenty of practice with the mflb first, because the smell is MUCH more intense if there's accidental combustion."
mflb,3crlr3,grapesodabandit,5,Fri Jul 10 06:08:29 2015 UTC,"I just blow directly out the window (mouth nearly touching the screen) and closed my window after im done vaping, no smell inside."

I own the smoke buddy (would recommend the normal one over the Jr. I hear it isn't near as good, or doesn't last as long.) and when I use my smoke buddy, virtually there is no smell. Odor does come from the box/herb itself as others have said, but nothing a little extra precaution won't take care of.   Crack a window, turn on the fan, grab your smoke buddy and vape away!  Edit: Here is a gif I made about how I use my smoke buddy."

With that said MFLB has the least smell of anything I've ever used, though it becomes more noticeable with the lid open for obvious reasons.   If it's honestly a concern crack a window, use a sploof or smoke buddy and spray a little oust after each session.   But the MFLB is the best starting point, for unnoticeable smell, there is IME."
mflb,3crlr3,bannable17,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:17:12 2015 UTC,"First off, there is no ""smoke"" so a smoke buddy would just be redundant. second, the book explains how to use it so there is no smell. but even if it did, (which it does a little) it is easily confused with coffee."

Just add a little and you can always add some more.  It gives a good taste and smell. Will it cover 100% I don't know but it sure makes it harder to recognize."
mflb,3crlr3,TogeanIslands,0,Fri Jul 10 07:59:44 2015 UTC,"You'll be good, it shouldn't last a whole lot of time either unless you combust or open the lid a lot. I suggest you have the herb grinded already so that it eliminates even more of the smell that it usually would since most of the time I smelled it was because i had just packed it. However I also suggest you look up Ozium. Ozium is a spray that eliminates strong odors like these. I think it was made to take away the smell of cigarettes but it works really great with this. Just one spray and you'll be good in a matter of minutes to maybe an hour. They sell them online but I was able to buy some at my local Walgreen's."

I can count the number of times I remember a kid in school (k-12) having a peanut allergy outbreak growing up: 0   Doing some quick research says this allergic sensitivity increased 50% from 97 to 2011.

mflb,3cnat5,dbburgess98,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:49:06 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm glad someone else likes it. It was heart wrenching to have to bust up my baby. But at least something nice came out of it. Now I can carry the good vibes of my old box around with me always. :)

mflb,3cnat5,Lexx4,2,Thu Jul 9 21:36:26 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm really curious, I've had a fancy mflb for like two years with walnut wood and an etching. When the sad time comes eventually to warranty it, will they send me the basic model or will I get something that resembles this one?"
mflb,3cnat5,Herbalist33,2,Fri Jul 10 03:25:01 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, if it's just a walnut with one of the standard etchings they'll send you and identical replacement unit. If it's an artisan collection launch box, or an exotic wood launch box they would have you send it to them for repairs. It all depends on the specific nature of your case, but the people at Magic Flight are amazing and if your just honest and work with them they can really help you with anything you need."
mflb,3cm8j2,yetifoo,13,Thu Jul 9 00:23:36 2015 UTC,"It totally looks like a bottle version of the ufo. Hole on the top is for the whip, stem it where you inhale from, bottle contains the liquid. They'll probably advertise it as a more travel-friendly camping-friendly way to get the water action experience."
mflb,3cm8j2,rweed,2,Thu Jul 9 01:33:07 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this idea for a long time. I even thought about writing to MFLB about it. I think it's great. You take a random bottle and voilaa, bong."
mflb,3cm8j2,TogeanIslands,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:03:28 2015 UTC,Is it really a bong? I don't think so. I think it's more like an orbiter: a watercooler.  A bong has imho always an option to suck the whole vapor/smoke in with one big breath. Therefore it needs to have a big opening for the mouth and a possibility to open the airstream (either by lifting the chillum or opening a hole).
mflb,3cm8j2,CptRotzbarbe,2,Thu Jul 9 12:25:25 2015 UTC,I think it's only the bottle cap to make any bottle to a bong.
mflb,3cm8j2,TogeanIslands,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:39:55 2015 UTC,"And how does it work to suck the whole vapor out at once when you only have the small opening of the suction straw?  I think you really need a bigger opening. A usual bottle opening is too small for this.  Believe me, when we were young we tried to make bongs out of old pvc cola bottles, but it did not work with the small opening. We had to use juice bottles with a big opening."
mflb,3cm8j2,CptRotzbarbe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:07:03 2015 UTC,I believe your definitions of a bong are different and that is why you guys aren't agreeing on what it is called but agree that it will be a device that allows the user to get some water action with their mflb
mflb,3cm8j2,rweed,11,Thu Jul 9 17:27:35 2015 UTC,I think it looks like an MFLB adapted Water Puff.
mflb,3cm8j2,bluemanalishi,9,Thu Jul 9 01:33:21 2015 UTC,It's obviously a straw adapter for bottles that makes them spill-proof for people who are bad at drinking out of bottles.

mflb,3cm8j2,ADHDABE,2,Thu Jul 9 00:24:24 2015 UTC,It appears to be some sort of knock out device. I doubt it's a bottle version of the ufo. You can see an intake hole on the top.
mflb,3cm8j2,ADHDABE,2,Thu Jul 9 01:07:53 2015 UTC,I'm having trouble figuring out how it might work
mflb,3cm8j2,ADHDABE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:12:20 2015 UTC,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2jXIR2J0lk0  But instead of a joint it'd have a draw whip going into it. The vacuum from the draining liquid will turn the bottle into a 3rd lung. If that's the case I'm buying one no questions.
mflb,3cm8j2,stone_r_steve,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:25:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, to me it looks more like a waterfall, where the mflb plugs into the ""draw stem"" and you hold the top part while you drain the water, and it pulls the vapor into the bottle, and then you pull the mflb out and inhale."
mflb,3cm8j2,ADHDABE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:07:36 2015 UTC,I could see that but it seems odd they'd allow direct wood and water contact.
mflb,3cm8j2,rwzephyr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:57:59 2015 UTC,Perhaps a waterfall device?
mflb,3cm8j2,ADHDABE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:23:02 2015 UTC,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2jXIR2J0lk0  But with a mflb instead of the joint thing.
mflb,3cm8j2,rwzephyr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"Knockout in the way it uses a bottle as a bong, probably. But using it as a Knockout to chug a beer while drawing into the bottle to then hit the vapour wouldn't work very well, the knockout draws really hard and quick when you use it that way and I couldn't see it getting a decent hit from an MFLB."
mflb,3cm8j2,MrGort,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:11:24 2015 UTC,They could have modified it like they modified the brass tip for the bellows to restrict airflow. All I'm saying is a knockout from a MD would be super kick ass.
mflb,3cm8j2,CharlieTango,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:58:53 2015 UTC,"Oh no doubt with a MD, I was more thinking a vanilla MFLB. The first time I used my knockout it was a nice big clump of hash.. It kicked my ass."
mflb,3cm8j2,WeedFinderGeneral,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"Not that i think MFLB's is, but a Knockout with a Ti combustion tube might be interesting."
mflb,3cm8j2,BonersGo,2,Thu Jul 9 12:16:52 2015 UTC,"Looks like a gravity powered lung. Poke hole in bottle, release water, vapor gets pulled into bottle."

TIP: If it gets you high, you're doing it right."

I'm not saying you should fess up every time, sometimes if you know you're getting caught it's best just to own up and be done with it. They're less likely to come down hard on you in that situation.   That being said, if you've got no paraphernalia and you don't stink of bud and it's somewhere where you can guarantee they won't find it, be friendly and consent to a search. It'll be over quicker and you can go about your day unhindered."
mflb,3cie3l,earthtroll569,5,Wed Jul 8 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"be aware that combustion is bad for your box. if you see embers, stop hitting the box and keep the lid shut to starve the combustion of oxygen. if your screen gets burnt, you have to deal with that for the rest of your box's lifetime. i've had my mflb for over a year and the screen is like a warzone, because i was careless at first."

Some people pick up the box and are alright at using it right away, but some people just have some trouble figuring out the techniques. That's fine! Don't hesitate to experiment and deviate slightly from the plan if you think it might work. That's definitely the best way of figuring out how to use the box best -- a lot of us like to change up our technique even though we've been using the box for a long time."

mflb,3cggn7,ocean_potion,6,Tue Jul 7 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"Works pretty well don't it? :p Sipping can run it hot but in my experience doesn't work as well as using it native mode and making a cooling chamber in the mouth, and doing a long draw while redirecting the vapor jet so you don't feel it directly, but after it expands. That way it feels cooler and you can find where the sweet spot is. I prefer this over sipping because it's more predictable and easier to read and control."
mflb,3cggn7,mflbninja,5,Tue Jul 7 19:35:06 2015 UTC,I agree that each intake method has it's own perks... I enjoy using the stem (glass in my case) so I can reclaim any buildup and make stem milk.
mflb,3cggn7,AlwaysGettingHopOns,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:52:12 2015 UTC,Do you ever use your tongue or teeth to cool the vapor down in your mouth? I find that I end up alternating between the left and right sides of my mouth to cool down the vapor.
mflb,3cggn7,magnacarter24,2,Tue Jul 7 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"I try to keep my teeth away from the vapor jet. I have one tooth turning yellow already. :p However the tongue is quite useful in redirecting the vapor jet wherever it works the best. I don't go left and right personally, but I center the vapor jet and try to make as large a chamber as possible for cooling."
mflb,3cggn7,mflbninja,2,Tue Jul 7 21:53:30 2015 UTC,While hitting rest your tongue on the roof of your mouth. The vapor will be forced to take a longer path and thus cool

mflb,3cgfsx,yuriSpadeface,2,Tue Jul 7 21:47:08 2015 UTC,"It looks right to me, but the lack of power level markings is odd. Does it have a serial number? Magic-Flight will check the validity of a launch box serial number if you ask them, IIRC. I assume they'll do the same for a power adapter   If it doesn't have a serial number, then it's either a model I don't know about or a fake."
mflb,3cgfsx,rodneyb74,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:59 2015 UTC,It does have a serial number. I'll email them and check it out. I was just confused while going through the book it clearly shows a wheel with markings on it
mflb,3cgfsx,RighteousCookies,2,Tue Jul 7 21:09:24 2015 UTC,I just received my PA from mflb. Com last week and it looks exactly the same. Only discernable markings around the dial are the positive and negative symbols so I think you're in possession of a legit.  Happy vaping!
mflb,3cgfsx,rodneyb74,2,Tue Jul 7 23:43:15 2015 UTC,"Mine has the metal cord protector by the push button section and it has the three white dots on the wheel. However my wife had the older model without the cord protector, and it started to go bad, they sent her a replacement that had the new Plastic cord protector like yours and her's didn't have dots so I think you are fine. Mine gets moved around a lot as I use it so sometimes the wheel gets bumped, I took a ponytail tie and wrapped it around the control box a couple times and the tension of the band on the wheel holds it steady when I move around. You could set it to where you know you like it and then use one of those bands or just a rubber band to hold it in place, or tape for that matter but I still like to move the wheel up if I'm using my Maud Dib."
mflb,3cgfsx,lersday,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:42:40 2015 UTC,My chord protector is metal actually. Is the plastic one supposed to be better? I didn't see these things on the website? Is there someplace that has the latest features for the different accessories?
mflb,3cgfsx,paltonas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:49:13 2015 UTC,"No, the plastic one was discontinued. If you bent the plastic ended PA enough times, it'll fray and fall apart, much like any plastic power adapter. The metal is right at the weakest point of the PA to prevent the fraying."
mflb,3cgfsx,likeli0ns,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:18:31 2015 UTC,"I heard they don't necessarily update info on a product when they make it better, but when you file a warranty claim you always get the newest and best iteration of a product. The metal cord guard I think was designed to help protect the portion where the cord comes in from breaking down and causing the unit to fail. I think it was machined in house originally. It was replaced by the plastic or Bakelite piece, that looks and functions the same, I'm sure it's just easier and cheaper for them to have made."

mflb,3chmdz,rlaitinen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:02:25 2015 UTC,"Part of the warranty claim process is telling MFLB where and how much you paid for your claimed device.

It's a sort of safety mechanism. Something similar can happen from drinking alcohol where when you fall a sleep depending on the quantity your drank you may wake up in the night feeling sick.  It's just a kind of safety feature in your body. Some peoples are most are sensitive then others meaning they are more or less likely to be awoken."

mflb,3c97u6,rlaitinen,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:04:04 2015 UTC,"Its not actually that easy to use, and after extended use with both the power adapter and orbiter, i can honestly say neither are worth the money. Yes the batteries are awful, but all the power adapter seems to do is either burn or barley vaporize since all you have to change temperature is a vague dial. There just doesnt seem to be a sweet spot.  For all the work it takes ill just grab my bong for a easy and quick toke. I Understand i am a very small minority with my opinion, i just think people should hear some un-happy stories before dropping that cash."
mflb,3c97u6,Exigncy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"There is definitely a sweet spot- it's around 40-45% on the dial, just a bit before the second 'half-way' dot.   If you get a good FG grind fresh trench, set the dial there, and start hitting, you get great flavour, slight clouds, but hit that a few times, and as the herb loses moisture, then more of the cannabinoids start being released.  It's all about finding the balance. You have to remember that as you vape the trench, and the herb loses moisture, you don't necessarily need to increase the power in the dial to get vapour, just need to take a few more draws. Il usually roast most of a trench at 40-45% on the pa, then crank it up to 60-70 to finish it.  Peace"
mflb,3c97u6,Herbalist33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing... Until I got it. I'd had my MFLB for about 2 years and found myself looking for a higher powered plug in vape, but all of those were pretty expensive and had a lot pieces and parts that I didn't want to deal with. I decided to buy the PA and it's worth every penny. I think the best part is that you don't have to deal with that awkward hour anymore where your battery is almost dead, but you keep hitting it and getting weak hits because it's not quite dead enough. Every hit is strong and even with the PA. Plus, for about $200, you get one of the best portable vapes on the market as well as a solid plug-in vape, all with a lifetime warranty. I guess what I'm saying is that it seems expensive for such a little piece of equipment, but it's so worth it if you can spare the money."

I've heard some hear turn their PA up near the end.  Do you use the finishing grinder or just a regular grinder? I noticed having this problem more before I got the FG.

mflb,3cbe86,anon99161,2,Mon Jul 6 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"Glyphs are best by all means, and stay away from rebranded generic batteries. They often do not meet their marketed mah values.    If not glyphs, buy only name brand batteries made and sold by a reputable battery manufacturer. Powerex 2700 mah are probably the best bet if not glyphs.    But your choice should be based on how and where you use your MFLB when portable. Different types (LSD/HSD/Glyphs), offer different ""best for"" uses."

mflb,3c7xx9,comeatmebreau,3,Sun Jul 5 19:10:17 2015 UTC,.2g trench seems like a lot; mine are usually around .08g.  Not that there's anything wrong with that though; especially if you have no current qualms about the efficiency.
mflb,3c7xx9,Octans,4,Sun Jul 5 19:38:52 2015 UTC,Well I was kind of estimating really.  I think I get about 5 trenches out of a gram.  I used to put less in a trench but since I got the FG the fine grind has made it easier to fit a little more.

mflb,3c7xx9,Texas_tokinHD,2,Mon Jul 6 18:13:39 2015 UTC,Is a dart stem/finishing grinder worth the money?
mflb,3c7xx9,XtReMe_XYZ,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:59:33 2015 UTC,The finishing grinder is amazing! But the price is indeed expensive but you may be able to find a good deal for about 25-30$
mflb,3c7xx9,ThirdEyeTrippyShit,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:25:23 2015 UTC,I like both a lot.  The dart stem is comfortable to use and cools vapor a little better than the glass stem.  I'm quite happy with it and glad I spent the money.  They FG is awesome.  I get much better vapor quality and a stronger high since I got it.  It bumps the MFLBs performance up a serious notch.  I got mine on Amazon a little cheaper than from Magic Flight so make sure to check their prices if you're on the fence.
mflb,3c8hwl,mrgnome1538,4,Sun Jul 5 22:02:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in no way exclusive to the MFLB or its accessories, but I do find myself mostly buying Magic-Flight's products. The price is steep, but the lifetime warranty is what really does the trick for me. I have a manually controlled portable vaporizer, adjustable AC power supply, glass water pipe and whips, maceration (I think) grinder, and all of them will be replaced if they break.   I'd like to buy more vapes, but for my essential kit, I love the idea that I can't lose them by breaking them. It certainly doesn't hurt that I really like the company and its products, too."
mflb,3c8hwl,21TQKIFD48,5,Mon Jul 6 00:53:56 2015 UTC,"This and a half. When you focus on the cost of materials it doesn't seem like much. When you add materials with artisanship, customer service, shipping (yes, shipping), and other costs, and multiply it by the number of times you'll need to use the warranty in your whole lifetime, the value begins to increase quite a bit."
mflb,3c8hwl,mflbninja,2,Mon Jul 6 02:12:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that the accessories are priced very exhorbitantly, and I have made a lot of them using regular household products. For example, my ""finishing grinder"" is my regular grinder, of which I pass the stuff through a tea ball using a champagne cork like a mortar and pestle.  I've only bought the MFLB and the power adaptor. I did spend about $20USD buying other batteries because I couldn't wait for the regular batteries to finish charging.   That said, this is in and of itself an expensive habit we have, but it's all in the game."
mflb,3c8hwl,legends444,2,Mon Jul 6 00:59:20 2015 UTC,i think at some point I'll revive the ol' box and buy a PA but for now I have to move on. Where'd you cop the PA and for how much?
mflb,3c8hwl,legends444,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:39:58 2015 UTC,"I bought it off Amazon. It's currently about $3 less than what MFLB sells it for ($79), but I just checked my order receipt and I paid $68 for it.  There's also a website (I'm sorry, I don't recall it's name), where people sign up to buy things from the manufactureer. If enough people sign up, all of them get around a 20% discount, because the website company can then do a bulk order that costs less per unit. I'm sorry I don't recall its name, but the website buys things in bulk once enough users sign up to buy it. It doesn't cost anything to sign up, but once the supplier agrees with the website, then enough people need to put deposits (essentially the discounted price) before the website can actually buy it. I wasn't patient enough to wait, so I just bought it off amazon for $10 off, but then like 5 days later the bulk order got approved and I was like eh..."

mflb,3c8hwl,blottfor,2,Mon Jul 6 03:04:39 2015 UTC,"The price isn't even that steep Jesus Christ. 120 dollars for a vaporizer with a lifetime warranty that can achieve excellent vapor production and effects with minimal technique is a steal. And the power adapter, which also has a lifetime warranty, magnifies the potential of the LB greatly. I mean look at the vape exhale cloud or whatever it's called. It has 400 dollar glass additions you can buy, but a power adapter with variable temperature control for a portable vaporizer costing 80 is exorbitant?"
mflb,3c8hwl,mflbninja,3,Mon Jul 6 18:12:19 2015 UTC,"Not just the PA but everything by Magic Flight. Their exclusive products are incompatible with other tech forcing their customers to stay with their products. Yes everything has a lifetime warranty but at some point this old box is going to become obsolete. Their prices don't take that fact into consideration and they continue to roll out accessories in order to keep up with the rest of the market. Think about how complicated some of our setups are here on /r/MFLB, many are unnecessary when compared to the delivery some other vapes have to offer. You'll need (practically) an entire operation just to enjoy your bud for a sesh with the Magic Flight. Many people might not want to have their vape plugged into a wall, hooked up to an Orbiter or other water pipes, the bellows, a third lung etc. Many of us want a grab-n-go option. Yes the MFLB offers that but you have to use it just the right way in order to get your bud to vaporize efficiently and much more comes into play with the MFLB. There is a technique, and it's a tricky one. When I share my MFLB with a friend I have to give them specific, lengthy instructions for how to use the box properly. That roadblock is off-putting to many and limits the enjoyment factor of a sesh with friends/newcomers. Lots of other products don't do the job the same way, many are better, quicker, more efficient, cheaper and so forth.   This is what I'm trying to bring to light, many of us here in the subreddit advocate for the MFLB only and are stuck in this mindset that the company behind the product is perfect, and that there's no better vape out there."
mflb,3c8hwl,comeatmebreau,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:41:24 2015 UTC,"The thing is you don't need any accessories for it. The power adapter is a big upgrade but the box with batteries works great, with technique. Once again, this isn't trying to be a session vape to share with multiple friends. All their other products are basically art pieces that if you want to buy and support the company do so, but all of them have valid replacements you can make for like 5 dollars. The orbiter, finishing grinder, and mellow bellows can all be made with pill bottles, coins, tubing, and a water bottle."
mflb,3c8hwl,TLSOK,2,Mon Jul 6 18:44:07 2015 UTC,"And then there's that factor as well. Offering products at these prices which deter so many people from purchase is a topic for discussion also. When we get to the point of Macgyver-ing makeshift products then the question of quality-of-use comes to mind.   Do I want to jerry-rig waterbottles and hoses? No, IMO that's a waste of my time. Many people would agree. If you're the creative type sure, go for it. Lot's of us enjoy it.   My main concern is that this is necessary to get that level of performance we want out of the MFLB."
mflb,3c8hwl,thissiteisawful,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"It's not, none of it is. Accessories are meant to enhance and diversify the experience but you should be able to get where you want to be with just the LB and a battery."
mflb,3c8hwl,beerandabike,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:46:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that the prices are very steep but here's how I rationalize it.  When I bought my MFLB it was my first vaporizer I wasn't even sure I would like vaping, turns out I do.  Luckily, I'm not stuck with a total beginner vape that I now have to replace.  Instead, I can just buy upgrades as needed.  Each upgrade is a hit to the wallet but let's say I bought the starter kit then added the PA and FG: total cost is $245.  In my opinion, with those upgrades I would have quite a good vape.  Now let's pretend I had chosen to buy a Flowermate V5 as my starter vape for $80.  It's a little cheaper and probably has similar performance to the MFLB starter kit.  The difference is that once I outgrew the Flowermate I'd have to replace it entirely.  So to get a vape that's really going to be an improvement over the flowermate I'd probably have to spend close to $200.  So the total cost here would almost certainly be over the $245 price of the MFLB + PA + FG and you don't get the warrantee.  But I'd like to hear what other people think.  Is this a valid selling point or just bullshit?"
mflb,3c8hwl,do-un-to,3,Mon Jul 6 05:37:14 2015 UTC,"If I take this rationale into consideration then I still would consider myself in a comfortable position. I only spent $35 on my new Hebe Titan 2, in my mind that's almost negligable compared to the longevity and price of the MFLB products.   Because I still have my box I can always return to it in the future."
mflb,3c8hwl,somanyroads,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:18:59 2015 UTC,There are list prices and there are street prices.  You can find the starter kit on ebay for as little as $83 (free shipping) and the PA for $70 (free shipping). Mouthpiece (stem?) is optional - the acrylic stem (supplied in the starter kit) is $1.
mflb,3c8hwl,cadet000,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:56:49 2015 UTC,"I get that. Many of us here are experienced online bargain hunters but at the end of the day bargains exist for other products as well. Some of the deals I find online blow MFLB prices out of the water, even if they're offered on eBay, Amazon or other discounted sites.   This draws some of us away from MFLB exclusivity. The MFLB isn't the end-all-be-all anymore. Maybe 3-5 years ago it certainly was when there were no other significant competitors but the market has changed significantly enough for us to reevaluate Magic Flight's pricing and products. Sitting here online on forums saying it's the cat's pajamas wont progress the community as whole further but rather keep us stagnant within an evolving world progressing beyond us in terms of tech and capabilities."

If I knew how to be artistic with a wood burner I'd totally make DOOM masks around the sides.

The wood is porous so like the acrylic, cannot be reclaimed via ISO washing but both benefit with a much stronger build. The glass is used by many for it's touch and feel on the lips and the ability to iso wash, obviously apart from being the one that comes with the mflb.   Personally, I have had all the stems available and I prefer the acrylic one. I've dropped the box numerous times and usually involves me sanding down the glass steam, not the case with an acrylic one and it also builds reclaim quicker."

You Pay: 19.99 for a 4-PACK - sucks.    If they are 2300mah, they are not true ""fast charging"" batteries. Above 2400mah can be true 15-20 minute fast chargers, but these are likely pseudo-fast, at around 2 plus hours from partial, and 4-6 from dead.    2300mah batteries will hold a charge for a decent amount of time, probably around 12 plus hours at about 80-85% charge.

mflb,3c2h3h,MrGort,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:12:39 2015 UTC,As far as I understand any NiMH can be charged in 15 min if the charger is well made! It has nothing to do with the slight increase in capacity. Keep in mind that the chemistry is the same!  'Precharging' is used to protect batteries with a very low voltage (this is mostly used on lithium cells below 3V) from large potential currents and is not usually use selectable. A good quality charger will do this automatically.
mflb,3c2h3h,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:19:30 2015 UTC,Do these need to be capped somehow to prevent accidental discharge?
mflb,3c2h3h,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:10:35 2015 UTC,You should always put the protective caps on batteries stripped of their labels for use in an MFLB whenever they are not charging or in use.

mflb,3c2xzu,emfourteen,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:51:42 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, it doesn't matter at all if there is uneven coloring. It seems like it would just make the ABV better. (varying amounts of THC etc, the greener parts having more THC). If you were not using the ABV, it might be inefficient to not achieve a uniform brownness, but I would guess that the darker the ABV is, the less potent.  Also - no need to make butter. The ABV is already decarboxilated and ready to consume. Mix with anything and eat. Peanut butter and honey is good. 1 teaspoon is I think about 1 gram and is a good dose. 2 spoons might have you lying on the floor."

Keep in mind that tolerance is going to be a factor, but I only burn about a trench every couple of days, so my tolerance isn't sky high. If you're wanting to make a big batch of brownies, I'd save up a bit more AVB to make sure you catch a buzz."
mflb,3byqub,TogeanIslands,2,Fri Jul 3 15:14:36 2015 UTC,The usual recommendation around here is 1 gram. Three is a lot. Though it does depend on how well vaped the bud is. And I smoke more than you and 1.5 grams left me weak a while ago.

Only once in Basel the security guy who screened the bags asked me what the box is, so I explained it's for inhaling herbs similar to a pipe.

mflb,3by462,Syed888,3,Fri Jul 3 02:57:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how the push back ring would affect your vapor. The push back ring is great because you dont have to pull the battery out. Also, the trench doesnt have to be near combustion to get a strong high. I saw your other thread and I think youre overthinking it a bit.   Make sure your batteries are charged/ get new ones if you've had them for awhile. Get a fine grind. If all you have is a grinder then try grinding upside down or use the quarter in a pill bottle technique. Brush out your trench after every use and clean it with isopropyl alcohol if it gets gunked up If its combusting then you are are drawing too slow or the material in your trench is cooked.   Hope this helps you out a little bit dude! :)"
mflb,3by462,testyourdrugs,2,Fri Jul 3 03:21:12 2015 UTC,"Seriously OP a lot of people over think the mflb. This guys points are the most important things to know about the mflb.   Also, read that little book that comes with the vape. If you have already, read it again. It tells you everything you need to know. Once you know how the mflb actually works (a very simple mechanic) it becomes so easy to use. READ THE BOOOOOK."
mflb,3by462,crystalizedsnow,2,Fri Jul 3 20:01:21 2015 UTC,"I use the MFLB without the pushback ring. Sometimes I notice that when I'm not pushing in the battery and instead just let it sit, the light doesn't shine as brightly, which might indicate that less power is reaching the trench as well.   This might explain it, since with the ring you're always pushing hard against the battery and it makes full contact and sends more power to the trench."
mflb,3by462,Beremat,0,Fri Jul 3 05:35:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same happens with me. Now that i think about it, i might as well put the pushback in because i literally have to push my battery in to get full power vape (which is why i removed it in the first place, so i wouldn't have to do that)"
mflb,3bwbeg,Syed888,2,Thu Jul 2 18:04:33 2015 UTC,I don't think it's the pushback ring... don't see how it would be.  You're probably holding the battery in too long. Try holding it in not quite as long.
mflb,3bwbeg,ForScale,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:10:17 2015 UTC,Cool thanks but also do i need to clean it with iso alcohol? If i don't  will it combust over time?

You can use ISO, plenty of people do, but I use grain alcohol... it's ethyl alcohol (the drinking kind); it's like 95% pure alcohol."
mflb,3bwbeg,ForScale,0,Thu Jul 2 18:24:58 2015 UTC,Does the alcohol improve vaping airflow and less burning VERSES if i only brush after each session and never use iso.

mflb,3bwbeg,RockyValderas,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:50:25 2015 UTC,Clean the screen and it will allow it to heat more evenly and allow you to use the batteries correctly.
mflb,3bwbeg,SP120K,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:34:53 2015 UTC,About 99% of the time it's your technique that's the problem. Just inhale faster so it doesn't heat up at much
mflb,3bwbeg,SP120K,0,Thu Jul 2 18:18:24 2015 UTC,I might get a stop watch to observe the time.  thanks
mflb,3bwbeg,SP120K,2,Thu Jul 2 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"It's not so much about how long you're inhaling. It's about how hard you're inhaling.   You need to inhale faster to keep the temperature inside the trench cooler. If you're inhaling too slowly, the temperature in the trench will get too high and cause combustion.   So don't worry about the length of time you're inhaling for. Think about how strongly you're pulling from the box. In your case, you need to inhale stronger.   IF you have a PA, then you could simply try camping at a lower temperature.   About cleaning with ISO. It will get all the gunk stuck in your trench out which will increase airflow. It will also let the heat from the trench reach your herb more efficiently. So your trench will heat up more quickly (which can lead to combustion), but there will also be more airflow (which helps to counter combustion).   If you've had your box for a long time and have not ever cleaned with ISO, you will have to be very careful after cleaning. This is when combustion is most likely because you will have to change your technique to match the new condition of your box."
mflb,3bwbeg,magnacarter24,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:49:58 2015 UTC,Thanks guys but my real questoin is ...do i need to clean it with iso alcohol?  are there any consquences if i don't clean it with iso
mflb,3bwbeg,stereo440,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:21:02 2015 UTC,From what I understand cleaning with ISO raises the chances for combustion. It's more likely technique because later you'll be able to clean as much as you want without combusting.
mflb,3bwbeg,Azerohiro,0,Thu Jul 2 18:31:26 2015 UTC,So your saying Cleaning with Iso increases combustion chances? Well i certaintly don't want that. ....But why do people do it if it increases combustion chances? Im confused
mflb,3bxgul,JediAlec,2,Thu Jul 2 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"Well how do you hit it? Draw speed, vapor production, length, etc. Also how fine do you grind your bud and do you have an unusually high tolerance. Also, shake that bitch after every hit it seriously helps."

I'm not used to being high on weed everyday and not remembering shit.   Like you, I do get high, but doesn't feel like anything really. I came to the conclusion that it is because you're probably used to the high you get when smoking? Anyway, the smoke high also affects your body, something you don't get here if you don't vape it until it's black.   Use the stacking technique, have your PA on and vape until the bud gets black, when it almost looses its taste, or when there is no more vapor coming out no matter how slow you go.   You should be toasted then."

If the mflb is not getting you high there are only two possible scenarios: 1. the box is damaged and malfunctioning  2. you are using it wrong.  Scenario 2 is much more likely, I could go in to details but there are novels worth of information about this exact topic on the subreddit."

mflb,3buxcp,spupul6,5,Thu Jul 2 10:28:54 2015 UTC,"I just typed out a huge post about what happened to me and for some reason it hasn't posted:(   So I'll make a smaller version as I'm at work and can't type it out again.   I bought my mflb and was happy for 3/4 months until I stopped getting high enough, I researched the Arizer Solo and bought it, cost me £130 but I was happy, after a while I read about the 'stacking technique' (search bar because I can't link)   I was getting way higher than the solo with much less weed, so the solo now stays in m drawer. I break it out occasionally if there's someone else wanting to hit it, ironically as it's called the Solo. But please try this method and get some new batteries as they lose power after 3/4 months!"
mflb,3buxcp,Bathingintacos,6,Thu Jul 2 12:32:10 2015 UTC,"Or if OP mainly vapes at home, then a PA could be a great option too. It's pretty pricy but there is no going back once you get one of those. It's wonderful!"
mflb,3buxcp,The_Kids_Lying,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I find the PA really makes a difference. The batteries were a pain in the ass to figure out how long to hold so it wouldn't burn, but enough to actually vape the pot. The PA made that so much simpler with the dial. Still don't get as strong of a high as I do with a nice pipe (I'd say bong but I just broke mine. RIP BongBro.). The MFLB gives me a more mellow high, good for being buzzed but still able to function.   Also, you can take the ABV to a darker brown. Maybe your sessions just need to go on a little bit longer?"
mflb,3buxcp,RighteousCookies,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:17:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I use my PA in the weekday evenings after work, but usually use my bong or a bowl during the weekends because I like to get more baked those days. The best thing about the PA is that you don't have that awkward hour where your battery is dying but you don't want to change it out because it's still working a little bit. With the PA, you get strong hits every hit."
mflb,3buxcp,The_Kids_Lying,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"I just got my PA, and have been using it exclusively for the past few days. Had to go back to the batteries this morning for using it out and about, and man, what a let down. lol"

I wanted a solo for the ""higher off less"" concept, but if compared to the mflb you don't get higher or at least save ganja then I'M OUT."
mflb,3buxcp,magnacarter24,3,Fri Jul 3 04:33:11 2015 UTC,"When you vape, the first half of your trench will only activate the THC in your bud. As the trench gets darker you will activate other canabinoids which also get you high, your best bet is to vape until it's very dark brown before you call it quits"
mflb,3buxcp,PM_UR_STORY,2,Thu Jul 2 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"It seems like the THC is being activated but not being released in the vapor. Not sure how to fix it, maybe talk to the people at mflb, could be faulty."
mflb,3buxcp,StayFrostyOscarMike,3,Thu Jul 2 12:27:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking the same but I dont understand.. she looks healthy :(. The box itself is so simple hard to imagine that it can be faulty.
mflb,3buxcp,electrophile91,2,Thu Jul 2 16:44:58 2015 UTC,I would get new batteries man. They only last me like 3-4 months and I only use 1-2 times weekly.

I know there are a lot more vaporizers out there, many will produce huge clouds, many will get you baked almost instantly... But I've run across very few that are as efficient with trees as the MFLB."
mflb,3bt3re,rodneyb74,4,Thu Jul 2 01:25:38 2015 UTC,Me too but I've had mine for a few months now. Low tolerance ftw

mflb,3bt3re,Bristlebot,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:01:21 2015 UTC,how come you only fill it a third? i fill mine right up to the top with a FG and let it last me through the day... or less ;)
mflb,3bt3re,Judemarley,2,Fri Jul 3 23:32:20 2015 UTC,Because it produces different effects based on how vaped the bud is. By vaping only a third full trench he's getting the entire experience from that bud each time

mflb,3bui2t,pdwoof,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:48:52 2015 UTC,Heat it for a very long time and just blow on top of the trench (while still heating) to eventually burn off unwanted residue.
mflb,3bui2t,thebotguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:15:03 2015 UTC,"The burnt ""material"" might be what is giving the bad taste, ISO then heating till its all gone might be better"

mflb,3bui2t,thebotguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:36:30 2015 UTC,You should brush off weed crumbs and residue after every trench and do a more thorough cleaning with iso alcohol (99% preferably) every 4-5 trenches.
mflb,3bui2t,ThouArtNaught,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:53:54 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree... There's nothing quite like a brand new Box! I just got a warranty one about two... three... weeks ago; it's already not tasting as wonderful as those first couple, brand new sessions.  I'd suggest cleaning all the parts that make sense to clean... the screen, even your stem if you want (but that goo in there is good stuff! try to reclaim it if you can!)."
mflb,3bui2t,ForScale,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:01:02 2015 UTC,I usually clean it with iso and scrub it with the brush it just isn't the same!

I'm not entirely reliant on it for stealth, but it certainly helps with ease of mind when I'm vaping on my porch. I made this gif to show how I use it, in hopes that it will educate others on the Smoke Buddy!"
mflb,3brzi6,_dabnation_,5,Wed Jul 1 17:54:28 2015 UTC,"Also, I like your homemade device"
mflb,3brzi6,_dabnation_,3,Wed Jul 1 17:57:39 2015 UTC,I still feel like there would be odor associated. Is there? You should have someone who wasn't vaping come in the room after using the smoke buddy for a whiff assessment.
mflb,3brzi6,SamwiseD,4,Wed Jul 1 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"I should do that! There is still an odor, as the water pipe and box smell on their own, but I've used the smoke buddy sitting on the couch next to my girlfriend but she couldn't smell hardly anything."
mflb,3brzi6,do-un-to,2,Wed Jul 1 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"I've had a smoke buddy for a year+ now and it works great with the vapor smell in my experience. Only thing I suggest to keep in mind (if you're being careful on smell) is the box itself, tubes, and attachments get smelly, and moreso over time. As an owner of a UFO, PA 2.0, several tubing attachments, & oily box after over 2 years of use, these things can really smell when left out in a closed room.  Nice .gif too haha happy flights, I hope my input may have helped on your future endeavors"
mflb,3brzi6,thissayssomething,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:10:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I've found the attachments smell a little (relatively new homemade piece).  Glad to see it works for you as well! Happy flights.

mflb,3bsgyb,music_player99,2,Wed Jul 1 22:04:29 2015 UTC,Yea but I think people would pay extra for it. I think I would
mflb,3bsgyb,orChasmic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:16:11 2015 UTC,Then maybe it could be some kind of premium bundle or something. I would buy that.  And it could double as a kind of carrying case.

mflb,3bthcl,compoundbreak791,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:38:58 2015 UTC,I'm just wondering why a non removable screen would be any different than the removable ones. The rails are right there cut that old one out and pop a new removable screen right on the rails. I'm pretty sure that's why they went with removable screens because the life of a screen is so limited for the hard work that they do. I would even assume the removable ones work just as well or even better as that is the final design that they chose to go with. That's all i've ever used and I think they work great. Like 20 bucks or so and you get three.
mflb,3br3d2,vapesncrepes,5,Wed Jul 1 13:48:58 2015 UTC,"Nah man high is high, if it's working for you no need to change. Plus it sounds like whatever you're doing isn't using much bud so lucky you"

mflb,3br3d2,SP120K,2,Wed Jul 1 15:12:56 2015 UTC,That is one of the best things about the MFLB. ! Trench could last me 2 days and still get me to a 7-8.
mflb,3br3d2,XtReMe_XYZ,2,Wed Jul 1 18:32:37 2015 UTC,Same! I can easily put about 1/10th of a gram in my trench and get to a 4 or 5 twice. I've been getting high almost once a day for the past month and have only gone through a gram and a half. This is the best purchase I've made in years.
mflb,3br3d2,nani_kore,2,Wed Jul 1 22:16:50 2015 UTC,"I'm always annoyed that i'm not making ABV quicker, because I like to use it to fill gelatin caps for travel. However the damn thing is so efficient it takes me a very long time, even with daily use, to get enough built up to load my cap filling machine."
mflb,3br3d2,rodneyb74,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:33:28 2015 UTC,Dammit I probably should have prefaced this with one important piece of info: I feel like past a certain point I hit a wall and just can't get higher I hit like a [5] and I'm stuck there I wana be at like a consistent [8]. I don't even have a tolerance either.
mflb,3br3d2,rosebowlriots,7,Wed Jul 1 19:23:16 2015 UTC,Most people on this site are gonna disagree with me but if you want to get really stoned you need to take big hits with visible vapor exhaled. Another thing is to continue vaping until your weed is brown and starting to get black. That'll get you a more stuck in the couch high
mflb,3br3d2,Mercurial_Illusion,3,Wed Jul 1 20:59:05 2015 UTC,Late to the party but when I learned to stack hits I got a nice thick cloud and got way high. I had the issue of being stuck at around a [4] until I learned that.
mflb,3br3d2,nani_kore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:57:45 2015 UTC,"What rosebowl said. Try holding down your battery for a good 5-6 seconds instead of the recommended 3. Then sip that vapor, it should be pretty strong and hit harder."
mflb,3br3d2,rodneyb74,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:17:46 2015 UTC,90% of the time I prefer to cruise at a [4-5] but it's no big deal to rocket up to an [8] if desired. Just stack a bunch of hits back to back.
mflb,3br3d2,mflmani,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:35:59 2015 UTC,"Good advice about the stacking of hits, thanks! I was unsure about seeing visible vapor I thought that was bad but if I'm gonna get higher then fuck it. I like a good [5] too, but it seems the only few times I have to smoke are on weeknights after work when I'm not busy and I want to get fucking rrrripped and it's just not happening yet hah. Thanks guys!"

mflb,3brgih,jeffazing,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:10:48 2015 UTC,"If yours came with the ball bearing on top of the box to keep the lid closed then that means you probably have the push ring inside where the battery goes which prevents the battery from staying in after a hit. Look and see if there is a black ring, if you do then leave it in the box. I'm a bit more oldschool and pull and twist the battery slightly out of the box"
mflb,3bpkp0,earthtroll569,10,Wed Jul 1 03:08:40 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. In fact, if you shake it for long enough you can get a very fine, powder-like grind out of it. If you do, though, the vapor will be very hot and you'll burn through trenches much faster.  I use the micro-grinder and finishing grinder these days. It's not as fine as a pill bottle grind, but my trenches last much longer. It's all about personal preference, really."
mflb,3bpkp0,mixedelirium,3,Wed Jul 1 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"If you do, though, the vapor will be very hot and you'll burn through trenches much faster.   Exactly my experience!  I've combusted more often with powered too and my trenches are done after a couple rounds."
mflb,3bpkp0,happyself,2,Wed Jul 1 11:46:52 2015 UTC,Another common way to get a fine grind is to stab scissors into weed at the bottom of a pill bottle and cut it up a lot. It can be a bit less noisy if you can't be shaking a coin around.
mflb,3bpkp0,Whitellama,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:29:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely!  Give it a try.  I use 2 quarters and two dimes, so they're all grinding against each other with their rough edges.  The material goes from buds to powder before your arm gets tired."

mflb,3bny8i,MrFahrenheit39,3,Tue Jun 30 19:06:24 2015 UTC,"I've always heard that with DMT, a crack pipe is the way to go, to ensure you get all the active ingredient vaporized and inhaled, but they're much less common than they used to be. You can get them on amazon, or do one of the many diy versions. As for MFLB, it would most likely gunk up on the bottom of the box, ruining it and wasting product. But that's pure speculation, so I'd love to hear from someone with experience."

mflb,3bo62s,rlaitinen,2,Wed Jul 1 04:59:24 2015 UTC,"I charge these batteries on this charger. If you follow the link to the charger, it makes it clear it can handle AA. The only issue I've had is it can be a little bit of a pain in the ass to position them just right (I think it's because of the lack of wrapper) to get them to charge, but after the first time fiddling with it, I've not had any trouble since.    I typically only use it for my vape, but when it's not charging any 18650s, it might as well do my AAs. Funny enough, the other popular vape charger, the efest Luc, cannot charge them."

mflb,3blwf8,thebotguy,4,Tue Jun 30 07:36:05 2015 UTC,"So Gilberts Syndrome from what I've heard is caused by the liver having issues breaking down red blood cells. This sounds like it wouldn't be exacerbated by vaporizing thc.   I did a little research on marijuana's effects on the liver and found a few interesting articles. One is relating to Hep-C, but indicated that THC consumtion through combustion did not have negative impacts on the liver.   http://www.truthonpot.com/2013/07/11/scientists-say-marijuana-provides-relief-from-liver-disease-old-studies-were-wrong/  http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/06/28/cid.cit378.short  Didn't find anything relating to THC and Bilirubin, but from what I read about bilirubin I don't think there should be any direct interaction between THC, a psychoactive drug, and the hemoglobin on red blood cells. I'd consider talking to your doctor about why he believes the THC use is worsening your condition and also explaining how it helps you. Also seek other consultation.   Good Luck!  Edit: Did a bit more research and found this quote on http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/marijuana/safety/hrb-20059701  ""Marijuana may interfere with the way the body processes certain agents using the liver's cytochrome P450 enzyme system. As a result, the levels of these agents may be increased in the blood and may cause increased effects or potentially serious adverse reactions. People using any medications should check the package insert and speak with a qualified healthcare professional, including a pharmacist, about possible interactions.""  Maybe ask your doctor about that specific issue, as it may or may not relate to your condition.   Edit 2: I'd also like to point out that the substance in cannabis that actually contributes the most to pain reduction is the CBD not THC. If you feel that cannabis helps you in a significant way you can explore the option of getting a medical marijuana card, if your state allows it. It is not a hassle to do and, despite popular belief, is not public information. At medical marijuana clubs you can get buds that are bred to be very high in CBD content for use in pain relief or even get pure CBD edibles. The issue with edibles is that you are eating it, which can lead to more problems with your liver. I'm sure if you consult with a medical marijuana doctor (one that's credible and not just a ""weed doctor"" for people who just want to pot) they'll have information pertaining to how marijuana consumption affects the liver and maybe even your condition specifically."
mflb,3blwf8,mflmani,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you SO MUCH for all your effort! Really appreciate it. Unfortunately I live in Germany and doctors/parents are pretty strict about cannabis. They didnt even know what a vaporizer is and thought I was smoking tobacco joints all day using the pains as an excuse to do so. Almost died at the hospital because I got pumped with painkillers which attacked my liver due to the disease. I am trying to find a more informed doctor now and get my hands on some CBD medicine since all those chemicals I get at the moment are just making shit worse... Thank you again, you really put me in a better mood :-)"
mflb,3blwf8,mflmani,2,Tue Jun 30 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"No problem and greetings from California! I'm sorry to hear that Germany is so strict about cannabis, as with your parents. It is definitely easier to acquire out here as medical cannabis is quite the industry in some states (including mine). I definitely know where you're coming from on this one though. I use medical cannabis to help with chronic depression and ADHD so I've explored many of the medical options from CBD pills to special vapor resins. Early on when I was diagnosed I tried all sorts of prescription medications that just made me feel terrible :/ But nothing compared to pain meds. I just got shoulder surgery and I've been on some pretty strong meds as well and they just mess you up. I can't imagine what its doing to you with your liver condition, especially if they put you on acetaminophen.   Anyways, best of luck! I'm not someone who really understands how cannabis laws work in Europe but I hope you can find a way to make it work.   Cheers"

mflb,3bkd99,CausersOfThis,2,Tue Jun 30 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"Directly from Vaporpedia:   ABV is a term used for spent material that has already been vaporized   It's essentially what's left in your box after you've already completely vaporized your weed. The material that's left (ABV) still has a good amount of THC and CBD (two of the active chemicals that we usually associate with the effects from marijuana use). Not only that, but because it's been vaporized, it's essentially as if it's been put through an oven, so the ABV can be eaten without any further cooking to get you high. People save it then eat it, smoke it, cook with it, make oils from it, so on and so forth.  PS, ABV and AVB (already vaped bud) are used interchangeably in the MFLB/vaporizer community"

mflb,3bjuap,Syed888,4,Mon Jun 29 20:27:30 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy said, you HAVE to inhale.   Read the booklet the mflb came with. It answers everything. Smh."
mflb,3bjuap,crystalizedsnow,3,Mon Jun 29 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, you need to draw. That's your temp control, and is exactly why you're combusting. Use the search to find details on the proper draw technique. Or your manual.   I use a tic tac container to hold it. I push my bud through a mesh strainer to  get it fine.    And yes, brush your trench. It'll keep it cleaner in the long run."
mflb,3bjuap,rlaitinen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:44:20 2015 UTC,ok thanks. where can i get a mesh strainer? how much is it?
mflb,3bjuap,rlaitinen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:09:12 2015 UTC,Pretty much anywhere they sell kitchen supplies. It looks like this. And it's usually like $5. Maybe $10?
mflb,3bjuap,rlaitinen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:13:45 2015 UTC,very interesting   so you put the mesh strainer inside  the grinder or....? what do you do to it to make it fine
mflb,3bjuap,hammontre,2,Mon Jun 29 22:29:09 2015 UTC,I push it through with my thumb. Some people use a cork.
mflb,3bjuap,MrGort,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:40:31 2015 UTC,i.meant where do you put the mesh strainer t
mflb,3bjuap,hammontre,2,Mon Jun 29 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"Nowhere. It's used instead of a grinder the process of preparing your buds. I usually dry out a quarter and grind all my weed at once, but sometimes I don't have time to dry and grind it all, so I grind a little bit up each time I vaporize. The person you're talking to uses the mesh screen when I would use the grinder.   If you have a good grinder that gets your weed extremely fine, you don't need a mesh screen. The Finishing Grinder from the same company that makes the Launch Box is a good choice. Some people use a regular grinder, but turn it upside down for a while when they are grinding. This allows the leaves to get ground several times, instead of immediately falling through to the screen.   Vaping is a little trickier than smoking. So I would definitely re-read your instruction manual and use the MFLB exactly as it says."
mflb,3bihjg,schwammerlklauber,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:29:27 2015 UTC,How much did you pay? Local shop has them for 130 vs mflb site 120... Wondering if I should just go pay the extra 15 to get it today
mflb,3bihjg,ProteinBullets,2,Mon Jun 29 16:00:24 2015 UTC,"No, you should order it from MFLB and spend the saved money on the black nano-grinder. Its a lot cheaper than the wood grinder, and it seems more functional."
mflb,3bihjg,ZombieMushroom420,2,Mon Jun 29 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"I have both grinders. The Nano Grinder is basically a mini regular grinder. It's nice, especially for travel, but for the MFLB, the Finishing Grinder is almost essential. I got one after having my MFLB for about a month, and it was like I bought a new vaporizer. I finally got the great experience everyone talks about. I almost think they should raise the price of the vaporizer so they can include a grinder with every unit. No question I'd put the $10 towards a Finishing Grinder. It seems expensive until you use it and realize how much money it saves you on buds."
mflb,3bihjg,hammontre,2,Tue Jun 30 14:53:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wouldn't have thought there'd be much of a difference in the two. I figured my nano was getting it just about as much as can be done, considering how fine it is!   I'm not shelling out for a finisher at this point, but perhaps I'll give the coin method a shot and see if I notice any improvement."
mflb,3bihjg,ZombieMushroom420,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:02:04 2015 UTC,"Hey, first things first - you have an awesome username haha  Anyways, the finishing grinder is absolutely amazing. I got to an  [7] with one trench. Mind you, it use to take me 2 trenches before to get that high. But I must say, it is quite expensive ($40) but it can be found much much cheaper if you use google.

mflb,3bfki4,FusionNebula,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:21:25 2015 UTC,"This are like over the top REALLY important rules:    Grind Consistency: Use the finishing grinder (twice!), you want to have the finest grind you could possibly have.  Temp Control: Different temps and techniques give you a totally different high! Nothing like joints, or bongs. Takes time so find out what kind of highs you like.    I have the thing for only 2 weeks and I slowly realize the importance of the mentioned rules! :)"
mflb,3bfki4,SEVENTYTIMESEVEN,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"I wait until I see a bit of vapor (3-5 seconds), then I slowly sip it making sure it doesn't get too hot & burns (takes experience). When I think it needs a shake (to ensure the plant doesn't stick to the screen), I sip hard to create the ""tornado"" inside and I find that works better than stopping half way through, then flipping, tapping, and shaking as per the instruction manual.  If you do the tornado method then you can indefinitely go on, but your lungs can only absorb so much THC per breath so I take my time."

mflb,3beq56,nickynad,2,Sun Jun 28 17:29:39 2015 UTC,"I think the best solution overall, especially once a Box's hole is no longer as tight as at first, is to remove a stem before the shaking/tapping. Regardless of the stem's nature, failure to do so risks in its falling to the ground. Glass could break, wood could get banged up... It's not worth the risk, in my opinion."

Just pop the blade back in once it's all clean. That being said, I definitely find the FG gets more gunked up than my crappy 4-piece grinder. The only upside to the FG is the grind quality IMO, I definitely think that it will out-grind any 4-piece grinder turned upside down, but if you're only getting it for the cleaning factor then I would pass on it."
mflb,3bbdml,ZNasT,3,Sat Jun 27 20:26:09 2015 UTC,Popping out the grate and washing each piece is probably easier than going full iso cleanjob on the 4piece grinder. And as I read somewhere else; buying it for the finest grind available is a good investment on it's own. Thanks guys!

mflb,3b6mhp,TriquetraG,4,Fri Jun 26 14:47:22 2015 UTC,It's not a different THC it's just a different method of intake and so its going to feel different. Your body is going to absorb the THC a little differently hence making the feeling different. Tolerance still plays a part.

mflb,3b5qmc,beanieboy11,2,Fri Jun 26 07:41:02 2015 UTC,I have the basic acrylic one. I like it because it's kinda cool to watch the vapor travel through it.

mflb,3b5qmc,Rekkore,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:44:10 2015 UTC,"The acrylic one actually builds up quicker than a glass one, and well yeah...i've also had to sand 2 glass stems after dropping my box so many times. Acrylic is so much better, I'd say wood one is alright but i never use mine ever. nothing beats seeing the vapour come down the stem and the being porous makes it a bit harder to reclaim unless you just push a nug through."
mflb,3b5qmc,Bathingintacos,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:24:15 2015 UTC,Is that actually true that the acrylic one harvests quicker? One downfall is that you can't soak it in ISO
mflb,3b5qmc,Rekkore,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:28:20 2015 UTC,"Well some say you can do an ISO wash but i'm not going to get into that since I don't like the risk but it's a common observation held by many on the sub that the acrylic harvests quicker.   Could be because glass heats up quicker and doesn't allow for much condensation inside the stem or because the acrylic stems are shorter and have less surface area, but no one has really done proper tests. It may not even be quicker , depending on your technique but many users like myself would agree it's quicker."

mflb,3b562i,LongLiveTheYids,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:04:22 2015 UTC,"The herbal blends are superior in my eyes due to just how many herbs are in there. Personally, vaping any loose leaf herb is for taste, whereas MF seems to have the calming mixtures down. Personal experience, but I still do recommend playing around with different loose leaf. Some people have claimed they alter how your box tastes, but I think it is minimal and quickly goes away once you toss some real herb in there"

mflb,3b6sie,CptRotzbarbe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:11:24 2015 UTC,"connect the MFLB to a 100% glass water pipe with a diffuser downstem, and put some ice in the chamber. milk small hits, rip it slowly and chase with plenty of fresh air, 1 breath through the mouth and another through the nose.  drink some water before and after the vaping process.  this is the most beginner-friendly method of using the MFLB to its fullest, if it is still too harsh consider an alternative method of consumption, like edibles."
mflb,3b6sie,silaber,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:32:12 2015 UTC,"from my experience, bong hits are harsh because they are dry. I always use warm/hot water (50°C for example) and it makes the hits MUCH smoother. if your bong has Ice notches, you can add ice to it to cool down the smoke afterwards but warm water->less harsh imo"
mflb,3b6sie,Baumbar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"The MFLB is a great portable vape but maybe you should think about getting a convection vaporizer with temperature control.  I have an E-Nano and the vapor is much smoother for me.  But I was always coughing more from the lungs than from the throats if you understand me (throats too a bit).  I'm not sure why the E-Nano vapor is smoother.  Is it convection?  Cleaner device? The Nano can be made 100% clean, as new, since it's only a stem and a screen which get heated.  Temperature control?  Maybe since you're sure to not get Benzene and micro-combustion with a good temp control.  I'm still trying to figure it out (help welcome!).  But many use the MFLB without such coughing problems I had.  I also used to cough a lot with combustion.  On the MFLB, I had a 1ft draw whip from MF which may help a bit.  I never use water but passing the vapor through water may be worth trying if that's your thing.  There's the Orbiter and UFO devices for the box all sold from the MF site and elsewhere."

Also I just wanna add that compared to other vapes, the mflb takes a bit more practice. However, you also have a lot more manual control over the vaping experience because of it.

mflb,3b0duy,SwirlPiece_McCoy,2,Thu Jun 25 18:46:46 2015 UTC,"Haha it's functions the same as a grav bong. We poked holes in the bottom of the coke bottle so water can get in and out, and a hole on the cap where 1/4"" diameter plastic tube fits, other end also fits perfectly into the mflb. Cut the top off a ice tea bottle, and filled it with water about 80% with water.   When it's made, you want to submerge the coke bottle so it touches the bottom. Hold the PA in for a second or so (to get the vaper going) and slowly raise the coke bottle. The way it works is the water gets into the coke bottle and slowly comes out while raising, thus filling the bottle with vaper. The slower the raise, or bigger the bottle, or more water, the more vaper you get. Once the holes on the bottle are about to be out of water, detach the tube from the mflb and put it in your mouth and suck while pushing the coke bottle down. Pushing the coke bottle down forces the smoke out, which (in theory) is only into the tube! It's not necessary as just sucking it like a straw is fine, but doing both speeds it up!  Hope that helps! If I suck at explaining, just youtube/google gravity bong. It's the same process."

I'd expect you'd get high enough to be satisfied before the batteries are dead, if this isn't the case maybe look into getting a new pair. Also when you first get it you do need to charge it fully first if you haven't done that."
mflb,3b14jv,dobby420,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:26:29 2015 UTC,I got an extra set of batteries. SO I let them charge for about an hour and then used them and am letting the other pair fully charge. They each worked for about 1 pack I would say pretty well. And yeah they work well it's just it shouldn't take longer to charge it than it does to use them xD But that's the way she goes.

However, they are not an official seller of the MFLB, and I personally recommend you look elsewhere. I bought my box from Puffitup and also oversaw the purchase of another box for my dad from Puffitup. I've had nothing but good experiences with them, and their packages/combo's are a damn good deal. I've also heard you can chat with them and create your own combo's for no added cost.  Tl;dr Yes it's legit. Personally I recommend you look elsewhere. But it should be safe to buy from them. [5]"

It could be the battery as you said, or your mflb might need cleaning. There are guides on the sidebar for basic maintenance, but you pretty much just cotton swab the screen with 91% isopropyl alcohol (you can find this in any supermarket/cvs/drug store).  I recommend the power adapter, but if you wanna make your gf happy take a nug and force it through the stem. This will collect the honey oil which you can smoke"

mflb,3awbb2,jokingrotten,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"You sip on the thing in intervals of about a second, and the bottle just fills with smoke because it doesn't make it all the way to your mouth. Then when you're about to run out of inhaling abilities you detach and power suck it all in. Obviously doesn't compare to a pen vape or anything, but you could probably muster a smoke ring or two out of it. When I hit normally, I usually never see the smoke."

BUT, it's the same size as the draw hole on the mflb. the tube fits in there perfectly (need to give the tube a little squeeze), as well as into the mouth piece of the bottle. the sizes at Ace were pretty easy to spot so you could probably do the eye test (as in, they were in intervals of probably 1/4"" as opposed to 1/16"" on nuts and bolts)"

mflb,3axti2,FusionNebula,6,Wed Jun 24 10:49:46 2015 UTC,"You could try vaping less but hotter hits. One good technique for this is waiting for a bit vapor to form over the trench, then take a sip, wait for some vapor, sip, wait, sip,... until your lungs are ~3/4 full, then disengage the battery and inhale the rest of the vapor. that way, more cannabinoids with a high vaporization temperature are released as opposed to a long, slow draw. Migh LB highs feel way more ""complete"" since I've started doing this, so it might be worth a shot.  Just make sure you don't combust your weed."
mflb,3axti2,oaschbeidl,2,Wed Jun 24 16:20:27 2015 UTC,"This is hands down my favorite way to use my MFLB, it was also easier for me to master than one long slow draw. It also seems to make me cough less which is always a plus."

mflb,3axti2,oaschbeidl,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"With a fully charged battery I'd say about 2-3 seconds. Just wait until there's visible vapor, then take the next sip."
mflb,3axti2,ForScale,2,Wed Jun 24 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"Hi!   What can I do, to make my experience with the MFLB better? - Should I span out my tokes? Take one toke every 10-15 minutes instead of everything at once?   I think this is a solid idea. Experiment with it, see if it helps you to achieve more of what you're looking for.   Are the highs from the MF shorter than the highs you get from smoking weed?   I'd say... typically... yes; at least in my experience.   How come can a trench (0.1-0.2g) of weed get me this high?   Efficiency perhaps. With smoking, the high temps probably destroy some of the good stuff; maybe that happens less with the LB and you get more of the good stuff from less weed. It's also said that you get a different mix of cannabinoids when vaping than you do when smoking. Maybe it has something to do with that... like more THC and less CBD when vaping produces a more intense high with less weed. Just some hypotheses.   Why do I get so sleepy?   I don't know... I wonder if it's strain dependent.    What does my head start hurting?    I experienced this a few times when I was younger and smoking weed. I haven't really experienced it with the LB. I don't really know how to explain it.   Any good advice on techniques and use, that I haven't heard of yet.   Conventional wisdom: Clean trench, fresh batteries or PA, really dry weed, very finely ground.   Also, how is your memory guys? Do any of you feel a decline in cognitive function after smoking more often with portable vapes and such? Does cannabis affect your daily functioning?   I'm 31, male, highly educated, moderately above average intelligence, eat decently but not great, don't exercise like at all, kind of an alcoholic, I've done a ton of drugs, I used to smoke weed and drink daily, now I drink and vape on the weekends. I feel my memory used to be pretty good... maybe above average. It still might be, but I feel it's worse now... but I don't really know. I do notice I'm not as sharp after vaping... usually takes me about a day to recover. I think tolerance plays in to that though. I don't vape daily anymore, so I would say that cannabis does not affect my daily functioning.  Also, if you're not aware of /r/lbregs, hop on over there and check us out! You can ask your questions over there too. You might get some different responses.  Cheers! :)"

mflb,3awsjt,mflmani,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:40:15 2015 UTC,Best way I found was holding it with the mouth hole side facing down and using a small flat head screwdriver (or other thing that would fit the shape) to grind out the glass. This worked great for me just by putting the corner of the flat head in the glass tube and twisting gently. The glass will fall out around the flat head and not into your box.   Did this about 2 months ago and have been using my box ever since without any noticeable difference.

You will probably combust at least once, but then you know where the limit is.   I've been pretty good about it, I've never combusted. I pay a lot of attention to the taste and the temp of the vapor on my tongue. But I am certainly getting the box over 380F, which is the temp it's designed to operate at.   The ""deep"" highs are only attainable at higher temps. That's why vapes like the Ascent are good cause you can just set the temp where you want.  If you have the PA you can just turn that up too."

That may be just something people came up with in this sub, or maybe it is widely used (not according to Wikipedia). Anyway isoproplyl alcohol is also called ""rubbing alcohol"" and should be available in EVERY supermarket and drug store, as well as Target, Walmart, and even probably every convenience store. It may come in various ""strengths"" or percentages.  I'm looking at a bottle that says 91%. May sometimes be 70%. Higher percentage better but probably makes no difference."

mflb,3apzxw,Snubber_,2,Mon Jun 22 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"I recommend getting a better charger than the MF-standard-charger. I use the BC-700 which has a very good battery refresh mode. This discharges and charges your battery until the best capacity is reached. This may take some days, but it really worked fine with all my batteries (I use this charger mainly for my photo equipment). This charger is not cheap, but it is worth every cent. There is even a better version of this charger (BC-1000) which has a higher charge and discharge current and helps to speed up the process of refreshing.  The big one also has the possibility to charge two batteries with up to 1800 mA of current, which let's you refill your MFLB batteries in about one hour.   http://www.amazon.com/Crosse-Technology-BC-700-Battery-Charger/dp/B000RSOV50/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435058177&sr=8-1&keywords=BC-700"
mflb,3apzxw,CptRotzbarbe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:20:31 2015 UTC,This seems like it would be a good solution but you're saying it takes days? I use the box every day so a charger that takes days to charge the battery wouldn't be worth
mflb,3apzxw,CptRotzbarbe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"The normal charging does not take days. The normal charging with 1000 mA will take about 2 hours, if you charge only 2 batteries at once you can charge them with 1800 mA which usually takes a little more than 1 hour to fully charge the batteries.   I meant that the refresh mode might take days. In this mode the battery gets fully charged and then discharged. Then it gets charged again and discharged again. In each cycle the charger compares the capacity of the battery. As long as the capacity is increasing each cycle, the charger continues. If the capacity does not increase anymore the maximum capacity is reached and the charger displays ""FULL"". This way you can revive old batteries.   The charger has four slots, so you can use one or two slots for the refresh mode and the remaining slots for normal charging. This way you can use the refresh mode for some batteries and you can still charge your other batteries."

mflb,3al11b,jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj17j,3,Sun Jun 21 06:08:56 2015 UTC,I would have just turned the original grinder on it's side or upside down to keep grinding smaller and smaller without all the transfer. Just a tip!
mflb,3al11b,StickyTreeTips,7,Sun Jun 21 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"thanks.....i did upside down grinder for a while but the FG is way better.  it has a very uniform consistency.  if you get and use the FG, you'll see."
mflb,3al11b,fort_wendy,3,Sun Jun 21 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"this is exactly my process! The only real difference is I don't have an empty tic tic container so I place the grinder-ground bud to the cap of the FG canister AND THEN pour it on the FG. Plus I don't do the whole bud, I just take some bits and pieces that'll last me days.  Word of advice, you don't need to press down while grinding with the FG. It just needs light, constant pressure for it to grind.  Experiment with the pressure.  I started out having all that gunk then learned how to FG properly and it actually cleaned the gunk out on its own. Plus it leaves the stems uncrushed."
mflb,3al11b,Honesty_Addict,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"Yes! This is great advice. You barely need to apply any pressure, just focus on twisting it. The grinder does the work, if you apply almost any pressure it just compresses the bud."

mflb,3al11b,happyself,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:00:29 2015 UTC,"Nice flow.  I so know what you mean about how the ground bud seems like a smaller volume.  If the process becomes too labor intensive, two considerations are to skip both grinders and just put a couple quarters + your nugs into your pill bottle, then shake weight that thing like crazy!  You'll turn it into powder.  Or, how about a $10 coffee grinder from wmart or amazon?"
mflb,3al11b,pizz0wn3d,2,Sun Jun 21 15:59:38 2015 UTC,i've never done the quarter thing but i do have a coffee grinder that i use to use.  i haven't seen very uniform consistency out of other methods.  The FG just makes it perfect so i don't mind using it.  i've heard of others pressing ground bud through a metal mesh sieve which seems like it might work but i already have the FG so haven't tried.
mflb,3al11b,funkyouup,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:54:25 2015 UTC,"If you want to prevent all ofbthst buildup on the FG, don't put any weight on the top of the grinder while you're turning it. The downside is that the stems won't get ground up, but you don't really want those anyways.   It takes very little pressure to grind up the herb, and pressing down on the top mostly just causes it to get mashed into the holes."

mflb,3al11b,oneofthosepimps,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:40:55 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good method. I use a bit of a different method. I have the mflb finishing grinder. I first grind it in a regular grinder. Then I transfer one trench worth into the finishing grinder and grind it. After that I take the top of the grinder off and take my mflb and set it upside down on the finishing grinder (it is the perfect size to fit in the mflb circle opening). Then I flip it over and pop the grinder out and get no spillage at all.

I paid for fast shipping as well (i made a pumpkin bong for halloween and wanted to vape out of it with the water pipe whip) and it was well worth it. As for tips...you already have the finishing grinder which is the key to great vaping. I put a small hair tie around my box to keep the lid secured. Usually i dont wait for it to heat up before taking the draw, i just adjust my draw speed as i feel the heat change then take the battery out before i finish the draw to take in any extra vapor and cool it down. It makes very little smell but you can burn if you dont pay attention. Im tipsy and I dont usually comment but here i am. Have fun and vape on!"

mflb,3aogny,Braekyn,2,Mon Jun 22 12:51:32 2015 UTC,Even if your technique is wrong it gets you just as high/just slower/less efficiently. Yeah its just a gooey sort of oil.
mflb,3aogny,Josh___S,2,Mon Jun 22 13:14:30 2015 UTC,"Use the stem for the first while, and check your vapor visually - look down the stem with the battery engaged until you see vapor, then start drawing in.  Keep your eyes on the stem, and you can see how much vapor you're making - as it heats up, it'll make vapor faster and you'll need to draw a bit faster. Draw too fast, and you'll cool it faster than it can be heated.  Try to aim for a light wisp of vapor in your stem - too heavy and you'll be burning your bud.  Regardless of draw technique, I'd advise drawing in about 50-75% of your lungs, then releasing the battery and filling your lungs as quickly - this will clear the box, as well as get vapor down into the more efficient parts of your lungs.  Hold for 3-7 seconds, and slowly release. You should have little to no visible vapor when you exhale. If you do have some, or you burnt your herb and there's some smoke, breathe out slower, and/or through your nose. Your nasal passage may absorb anything leftover.  Except for some exceptions (which you shouldn't worry about yet) shake your box thoroughly after every draw, especially the first. On your first draw, the bud will be more moist and stick to the screen easily. If shaking/tapping/turning didn't dislodge all of it, open it and use the brush or GENTLY use your finger/nail.  Once it dries, it won't be nearly as sticky and a quick shake should work. This makes for a more even vape and better ABV. (Already been vaped)  Speaking of ABV, keep it! It can be reused in edibles, bowls, joints, etc., as can the honey build up inside your stem!  If you plan on vaping kief, let me know and I'll give you a run-down. I highly recommend it! It's fantastic!"
mflb,3aogny,Braekyn,2,Mon Jun 22 15:43:42 2015 UTC,Luckily I saw this just in time. I know you weren't talking to me but I was planning on doing a kief trench. Is there a different technique?
mflb,3aogny,Braekyn,2,Mon Jun 22 16:28:16 2015 UTC,"There's a few, this is just what I find works best:  Grind some normal herb really fine, or use some avb. Make a thin layer at the bottom of the trench (Just enough to cover the screen). I use the back of my brush (GENTLY) to make a ""trench"" in the green so it goes up the side walls a little bit.  Now cover the green in a thin layer of keif. 50/50 is perfect, I find.   (Edit: Try not to let any keif touch the screen directly! It will melt/burn/stick to the screen)  Now, vape this without shaking until the edges of the keif brown some, then use the back of the brush to mix them together. Draw as usual, but open the box and stir around after every hit. It will stay sticky a lot longer than normal bud, so keep it moving. However DO NOT SHAKE. The keif is very likely to stick to the cover, so just stir manually.  After it's fully browned, it will still be a little sticky - mix it in with the rest of your ABV :)"

mflb,3am7bj,Bristlebot,2,Sun Jun 21 18:46:55 2015 UTC,"Nail polish would chip off really quickly. Acrylic paint or permanent markers may work, but make sure to do it on the top of the lid, not the underside."
mflb,3ajd38,freethebeesknees,8,Sat Jun 20 19:34:13 2015 UTC,No its under warranty. They like you modding your shit. Even if you fuck it up ever. Just explain what happened.

mflb,3ajd38,spagettaboutit,8,Sun Jun 21 03:15:55 2015 UTC,The fact that it is small would mean it slips around a lot. Maybe find a way to make it cover the little ball?
mflb,3ajd38,beanieboy11,7,Sat Jun 20 20:06:41 2015 UTC,I always melt the clip into the acrylic anyway. Use your battery and make contact on the metal clip until it melts in a bit. Let it cool and pop it up with a knife or something.  I sorta messed up where the ball goes with trial and error.
mflb,3ajd38,fruitysaladpants,2,Sat Jun 20 21:41:24 2015 UTC,uhm...I am kinda speechless. I have owned a mflb for almost a year and it STILL amaze me how McGyver this box is.

mflb,3ajd38,ChiefChickenToes,3,Mon Jun 22 05:22:26 2015 UTC,Pm me for more info. I plan on making more with different colors.
mflb,3ajd38,ChiefChickenToes,3,Mon Jun 22 18:17:18 2015 UTC,Interesting. What did you use to color the lid? Did you carve it for the look of because it was damaged anyway?
mflb,3ajd38,K4ylan,5,Sat Jun 20 19:58:07 2015 UTC,It's fresh acrylic. So the whole piece is that bright orange. I carved it just for fun to see what I can do with it.
mflb,3ajd38,21TQKIFD48,2,Sat Jun 20 21:42:35 2015 UTC,That's awesome man. Might void the warranty but it's cool to see some personalization!
mflb,3ajd38,FagDamager,5,Sat Jun 20 23:18:20 2015 UTC,It's not defacing anything. The other acrylic stays perfectly intact when you take it off. If you warranty it just show them that the other one is fine. It wouldn't damage the box anymore than the normal lid.
mflb,3ajd38,K4ylan,0,Sat Jun 20 23:40:22 2015 UTC,"Warranty does not cover lost, stolen, defaced, or willfully damaged units   It might fall under defaced or willfully damaged, but as long as you're warrantying it for something unrelated to changing the screen, they might replace it. Magic Flight is typically pretty lenient about replacing boxes."
mflb,3ajd38,FagDamager,5,Sat Jun 20 23:24:11 2015 UTC,"I think defacement is something along the lines of someone drawing a dick on your launch box. You might not want it there, and you might not want to cover over it, but you can still use your box as well as if there wasn't a dick drawn on it. As for willful damage, they go into a little more detail on their warranty page:   We will even warranty units that have been modified for reasons of artistry or improved functionality.  We do make an exception for units which in our opinion were deliberately damaged (ie, for the purpose of making a warranty claim) will be charged at full retail price."
mflb,3ajd38,son_bakazaru,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:31:13 2015 UTC,"did they change their policy? i thought they replaced units that were damaged ""on purpose"" (probably not the right words)"
mflb,3ajd38,godzilla1517,2,Sun Jun 21 00:17:11 2015 UTC,"They've never accepted ones damaged on purpose, but they always took boxes damaged by negligence.

mflb,3ajq6l,compoundbreak791,2,Sat Jun 20 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"You can eat it, but I'd personally recommend you dab it. You can also use the launch box if you have the concentrate trays. Putting it on a bowl and smoking it is also an option."
mflb,3ajq6l,stereo440,2,Sat Jun 20 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"Take a small piece, like half the size of a tic-tac. Place it on a small piece of paper, preferably raw hemp cigarette paper. Put this in your new trench and vape on. Repeat."

mflb,3ajx8c,ExPwN,0,Sun Jun 21 02:06:23 2015 UTC,"If you make it with isopropyl alcohol and take it slow, it should work. You just need to let the box dry in between strokes. You will have to deal it afterwards as well to keep the color in.  If it doesn't work and the box gets swollen or something, just warranty it."
mflb,3ajx8c,ExPwN,0,Sun Jun 21 02:06:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, this post proves how dumb some people are lol.     OP, you could probably do it if you mix it thick, like just a little water to make almost a slurry or thin paste even. Then smear it on, let dry, and rub off the excess."

I've never had a problem with damaging the screen while harvesting, but use caution depending on the tools you use. It's much easier to harvest the oil when the box is hot. The iso alcohol is helpful for when cleaning under the lid and the box itself. I just use a tissue on the box after I dipped the brush in iso and brushed the box. Brushing around the box during use can help with cleanliness."

Unless you've stuck something far enough into the box to smash it, it more than likely just ran out on its own. If you have nothing in the stem hole you should still see vapor forming and it should hit it just as well.  On the other hand, if it's not getting any power at all, make a warranty claim. It's simple as hell and they'll replace your defective box with a new one (just the box)  It comes with a lifetime warranty so there's no limit on how many insurance claims you can make.

mflb,3ahgfn,MrPointAndLaugh,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:29:07 2015 UTC,"I used to experience extremely low vapor production when my herb was not fully bone dry.  Subsequently, my only suggestion would be to air-dry your herb for a few minutes AFTER grinding. I hope that helps."

I inhale before I even see vapor in the trench, though I see plenty when I exhale. Maybe it is working, just not as quickly as before?  Like stereo440 said, it may be that your herb isn't dry enough. Report in after you try to resolve the issue."

mflb,3ahgfn,Domthedangerous,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:11:38 2015 UTC,"I figure the led is in the same circuit as the screen. So if one worked, they both would. Though maybe they are two different ones? I'd just call Magic Flight as ask them. You'll likely need to send it in.  Also, ensure the batteries are fully charged. Often for me, I'll ask myself the same thing and it'll just be that the batteries aren't 100%. Freshly charged ones can produce vapor really quickly."

And you should buy a pack of Maud Dib replacement screens for their website. Scrape as much of the honey off the bottom as you can and you got yourself a brand new dab box. Don't destroy it.
mflb,3agmxr,androqx,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:47:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for an actual answer. Would eating the honey at the bottom get me high? Or is it only worth it with the Maud Dib

mflb,3afzan,awanstore,2,Fri Jun 19 20:50:55 2015 UTC,What is your draw technique when using the box?   Couple tips: grind your bud as finely as possible and fill the trench almost full. Take a few tokes then dump it back out and rub the bud between your fingers to get it finer after it has been heated. Then reload and you should get more vapor.   You can also buy the power adapter and you'll be a lot more satisfied with it.
mflb,3afzan,l337m45732,2,Fri Jun 19 22:06:49 2015 UTC,"The Power Adapter is not required, only non-ancient batteries and a solid technique. Running the Launch Box hotter is simply a matter of slowing down your draw rate. Detecting and regulating temperature help as well. If you get charring or combustion, shake in the middle with the power on (stacking hits)."
mflb,3afzan,mflbninja,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:38:44 2015 UTC,"try getting an arizer air if your looking for portable vape. get a desk top vape, maybe a log one? start smoking/changing your cannabis intake choice  or take a T break for like 1.5 months and start getting high as balls again"
mflb,3afzan,Roundnotboxxy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:44:57 2015 UTC,"Why do you think this is a good idea, considering the question that was asked? OP's concern is that the LB isn't working well, not that it is working well and they're not satisfied. I would think that with access to my guide you would know by now how powerful the Box can be and not jump immediately to recommending other vaporizers."
mflb,3afzan,mflbninja,0,Sat Jun 20 17:24:09 2015 UTC,Upgraded to the solo.. All I can say is wow. The MFLB was a great starter vape but after a year or so it performs crappy.

The glyphs should last as long as you need them to tho, so if you use the powerex first, then the glyphs, you might be fine. But don't just toss the batteries. They're reusable, and if nothing else, you don't need to leave a negative impact on the area you're hiking."
mflb,3afd57,rlaitinen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:35:07 2015 UTC,"I don't mean toss the batteries as in just throw them in the river lol, I'm looking for something I can just buy a pack of and go through them one by one, like going to Walmart and buying a pack of AA's. However, I know that won't be sufficient. So, is it possible to buy a pack of batteries that meet the maH requirements that could, technically, be disposed of?"
mflb,3afd57,rlaitinen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"throw them in the river     I was hoping not, but you never know on the internet. lol   I don't think you're really supposed to use disposables in the mflb, because it's hard to find one of a high enough mAh. It needs to be over 2400 I believe. This page seems to indicate none of the common batteries come that high. But according to this page, Energizer Ultimate Lithium and VARTA Professional Lithium cells hit 3000 mAh.    Problem here is two fold. One, they have a higher voltage, which is gonna make combustion much easier. Two, I'm not sure about using lithium batteries in the mflb. Not sure they're meant for it. Best I can suggest is to get some in advance, try it, and if it works, take them with you."
mflb,3afd57,rlaitinen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:59:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you! One last question, when testing them out, what's the best way to determine whether or not they will work, besides combustion. What should I watch out for?"
mflb,3afd57,rlaitinen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:10:14 2015 UTC,"No problem, but I want to make clear I'm no battery expert or anything. So all of these recommendations are just conjecture.     If I was doing it, watching for things getting too hot, both vape and battery itself, would be my first priority. If the battery gets too hot to touch, immediately pull it out and throw it somewhere it won't damage anything.    Next, listen for any popping or hissing noises, which may indicate your battery is venting. I know if the glyphs vent, it's not as big a deal, but with a lithium venting, it's going to be nastier. You don't want that near your box or face if it does.     And beyond that, look for anything abnormal. But if the battery is going to do anything stupid, it'll most likely get really hot first. So be ready to yank it as soon as it gets too hot to handle."

mflb,3aft0l,moxie132,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:16:45 2015 UTC,"Some of the early wall warts can't immediately start at 100%, they overload or something.  But if you start at like 50% and slowly ramp up it'll be fine.  Realistically though you may want to experiment with power levels between 40-60%, I find that to be a sweet spot of good vapor production without being to hot or dry, and also a low chance of combustion.  However, it is somewhat slower, but also I find more efficient"
mflb,3aehff,GodOfChickens,3,Fri Jun 19 13:44:24 2015 UTC,http://www.sagewisdom.org/usersguide.html  This website strongly cautions against vaporizing Salvia.
mflb,3aehff,heyzeus_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"It would not really be vaporising as they caution against, it would be like burning it with a torch lighter as is normally done for salvia, but the heat would come from below,and instantly."
mflb,3aehff,D-DC,4,Sat Jun 20 15:05:47 2015 UTC,What do you do with salvia?
mflb,3aehff,MrMeridew,5,Fri Jun 19 14:05:26 2015 UTC,"Smoke it, and then trip balls for 20 minutes"
mflb,3aehff,happyself,4,Fri Jun 19 14:19:44 2015 UTC,Serious balls!
mflb,3aehff,mflbninja,5,Fri Jun 19 15:43:44 2015 UTC,"I just want to pop in and say the balls are super fucking serious. I forgot my name, location, life's story and even species, and was trying desperately to get back any memory of anything my life had been before it got all bunged up. Because I couldn't, I concluded I had either died or gone permanently insane. Also, my body was unaccounted for because I could not see it anywhere, not even the nose in front of my eyes. All I saw were endless huge chunks of orange plastic flying through me at very fast rates, all while I worried about my life being over and my responsibilities shirked and my friends and family being disappointed.  Protip: Don't do it unless you are ready to have your life forcibly uprooted. It's seriously like ripping the tree of your life right out of the ground and leaving the roots painfully exposed. The dirt will blow back over them eventually but it's not all that fun, let's put it that way. I was freaking out for a week, and it was two weeks before I finally settled down all the way.  I should probably clarify that this probably will not happen to you, at least so suddenly, if you can measure your dose and do it responsibly. I hear it's much easier to do this by quidding the leaf rather than smoking an extract, which is what I did to produce this bone-chilling trip. I hear the comeup on quid is much slower and smoother which apparently makes a huge difference. Stay away from extracts sold at the smoke shop unless you have a precise scale with which to quite precisely measure your precise dose. Or just do it like I did, and it'll be like ""here I come"" and rock you like a hurricane."

mflb,3aehff,heyzeus_,3,Fri Jun 19 15:33:48 2015 UTC,"I have seen someone stand up after taking a massive booking to of Salvia, then fall over. We helped him up to his chair, where he was completely unable to communicate with any of us for the following two minutes. He later told us he experienced a lifetime as one of the fibers in the chair, and felt unstoppable forces controlling him and holding him back (which we assume to be us preventing him from climbing up on the chair and hurting himself). Five minutes later he could understand us, but not speak for another ten minutes or so. After that he sat in a different chair very quietly for another twenty minutes.   On the other hand, my experience with Salvia was half a bowl, and it was the best drug I had ever experienced. Initially, my eyes were closed and I only saw the word ""love"" covered in hair, but then I opened my eyes and stood up, and everything in the world was beautiful and connected, and had a total sense of clarity. I only really tried for about five minutes, but my mood was vastly improved for the following hour at least, and mildly improved for the next week or so.  Sorry for the wall of text. Tl;Dr - be very very careful with Salvia. Oh and the reason it's still legal is because it's unique chemistry hold promise for treating alcohol or opiate addiction, and we don't want to bog down medical research like we have with marijuana and other psychedelics."
mflb,3aehff,SollyBoy,2,Fri Jun 19 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"Bit of a dark trip. Don't like smoking it anymore, takes you to some very strange places. If you're not in the right mindset it won't be pleasant."
mflb,3aehff,WoodyWeedpecker,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:38:01 2015 UTC,"IIRC Salvia vaporize at a much higher temperature than THC/CBD and combustion.  So you won't likely get many effects (maybe a mild relaxing feeling you can get from many legal herbs).  I tried it.   I also tried it one time with a desktop vaporizer that can reach high temperature and I felt a mild visionary effect.  I felt I was in another room for 15 sec.  I didn't repeat the experience.  Of course, all this may be related to the quality of the Salvia I had."

mflb,3aehff,abarthch,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:23:02 2015 UTC,"Those were not in stock here in the EU unfortunately, the extra one with the muad-dib will have to do it. What do you think will happen to the screen by burning the extract? No doubt it will turn black in no time but having burnt a lot of weed in my old launch box I imagine the screens to maintain function. But then again, the muad screens are probably more fragile and could break or get more resistant (electrically)"
mflb,3aehff,abarthch,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"With my low quality extracts, they tend to start to separate at the sides after a few sessions,then eventually sorta flatten out, and either stop heating up or disintegrate.  But then again salvia is not so oily, and much less of it would be used. On second thoughts, with a potent salvia extract the screens should stand up fairly well.  Edit: I should really man up and try it myself, but salvia trips are so scary and I have no one to trip sit me."
mflb,3aehff,abarthch,2,Sat Jun 20 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"Got my MD today, still waiting for the leaves. Have you considered vaping the famous Sage Goddess Emerald Essence? Might be more gentle for the screens if that's what you're looking for. I'm not going to order it since they will probably confiscate it right at the border."
mflb,3aehff,abarthch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:33:43 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought of that. Can you vape alcohol based tinctures?  It shouldn't get stopped if salvia is legal in your country.
mflb,3aehff,abarthch,2,Thu Jun 25 08:04:52 2015 UTC,(Minor update) The dried salvia herbs are too impotent to work with either the Launch Box or the Muad-Dib (I literally crumbled them to dust). The Launch Box gave me a slight head buzz (fatigue) but the MD's trenches are too small to even notice any effect at all with plain herbs. I'm not giving up.. the next update will include some salvia tincture (not the Sage Goddess Emerald Essence).
mflb,3aehff,RDearing,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:47:50 2015 UTC,Maybe air drying on the screen would be enough or heating it a little bit. Swiss laws turned this plant illegal some years ago..

I've done some testing where I'll engage the power then turn the part that plugs into the box, and there are definitely some dead zones in there.  Haven't had this problem with batteries before, but it might be worth a shot before going through the warranty process?"
mflb,3ae3cc,dustymonitor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:38:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice. My PA works with my old box without problems or dead zones, so I don't think this is caused by the PA.

If you happen to get one, my advice: Don't look, don't wait for temp to build up, put it against your mouth and tug the vapor in gently to gauge how hot it is with your mouth."

The price is low because it's kind of a DIY vape, meaning you control the heat/ amour of vape by alternating the battery and the draw rate.   I have tried other vapes (can't remember they're name) but I have to say they are really good but at £130, it was a little too expensive, the launch box was almost half of that price, life time warranty and can buy added extra add ins such as the Power Adapter, orbiter or a whip. All of which can be homemade. (The PA will probably take some electrical know-how. I have made several orbiter/bubblers for around £2)   I hope this information helps you on this vape, of course I'm not going to force it down onto you but I do really highly recommend it."

I really like that it's a little wooden box made by artisans. I've smoked from a pipe and bong before, too, but there's just something about the wood.. it's an organic, herbal, pure experience. It feels clean, above all else.   There's a part I don't like, though. Once you've used it for a while, it's hard not to want the PA .. and maybe the Orbiter, too. But it wasn't really designed with the accessories in mind, so you end up having to juggle a bunch of cables and whips and odds and ends. Which is fine if you've got a table surface nearby, but it's not really as ""easy"" as something that's specifically designed to be a tabletop.   But even despite that, and despite spending a lot more money than my initial investment by way of all the accessories (which I love!), I still don't regret my decision to get one. The way I use it has changed, but it's still that comfortable, warm wooden box."

Technique required and you will probably combust a couple times while perfecting technique.  Loss of efficiency if your technique is poor.  Not a great way to get friends/family excited about vaporizers because it requires a little patience and practice and isn't easy to hit the first time when you're drunk and hanging around the campfire.  No longer available on Amazon, which I thought was convenient when I bought mine.  Positives: Small and efficient.  USA made and LIFETIME warranty (that you may or may not need as the box is very durable and reliable).  No minimum amount required for full vaporization, allowing for proper dosing and release of all compounds available ""pre-combustion."" Doesn't need to be plugged in and hot when not in use (my biggest pet peave of logs).  Totally portable.

I don't recommend testing the strength and I don't think there's been a test posted to the sub (I'll check Edit: There's not one that I can find). Best way to handle it is stay safe and be gentle.

OP: Try gently warming the whips and stems in full fat milk. Not boiling, but warming. It will dissolve out of the stems into the milk. You can then remove the whips and give them a hot water rinse to clear them out.  This milk can be used to make coffee, tea or drunk with cocoa.  It might avoid you having to poke and handle those holes too much! ;-)"

mflb,3a96ob,legends444,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:57:27 2015 UTC,You could use whiskey or everclear. Leave an air bubble and probably dip it in warm water for quicker release.  tilt it back and forth forever. And the milk one should work too.
mflb,3a96ob,freethebeesknees,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:54:36 2015 UTC,"Best way to clean the whips is to soak in microwaved water for 5 minutes tips up (being careful not to get water in them) then roll a battery or rolling pin up the whip. Onto wax paper or silicone mat. I usually throw out my whip every few months for sanatary reasons you can get rolls of it on amazon for super cheap.. Iso isnt recommended because it can acually break down your whip..  As far the fear of small little circles, your on your own. Stay happy and ride the wave!"

mflb,3a8wmb,Ressotami,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:01:27 2015 UTC,The milk melts the oil and it just flows out into the milk which can then be drunk. A quick rinse afterwards with hot water and there should be no residue left to go bad.  Solvents and Acrylic can sometimes react strangely. The plastic becomes embrittled.

Usually not melty at all, I found the best way for that, is to use a small chocolate grater like you get in gift sets, to grate the hash directly into the trench, use as little or as much as you want, it won't gum up the screen. It's done when it starts to turn from extremely dark brown to black. In my experience, using this in the muad-dib is no more effective than burning it in a pipe, and although the concentrate trays worked, they just felt like they vaped a smaller amount faster. it seemed like more hassle for the high when it works fine straight in the launch box."

There are no vaporizer designed for low-quality hash, so its hard to find something really good, but I havent given up! A while ago I red alot about the Atmos Raw, that is unpopular because of ineffecient use of herbs (and that its a copy-cat company), but it should be great at solid concentrates like waxes, and one guy was saying that it was also great for his northern eur maroccan hash! Unfortunately I havent had a chance to try it yet, but I think its worth a shot!  After reading this thread, I will order a concentrate tray for my MFLB and try it out, I never thaught about that.

Loads of smoke shops in my country sell Mergic Flert Lernch Berxes which look exactly the same but lack the serial number and the warranty.  Usually the sure fire way to tell is price. If it's really $50 brand new then the likelihood of it being fake is much higher. That is less than half of the retail price set by Magic Flight.  Ask to see the serial number before you buy. Do your research.

If you're planning on using the AVB and want it to be a higher potency then having it a little less fine is what you want. If not, then you could stand to go a little finer as some have an easier/ better vaping experience this way."

I dont want them tho and last time i saw free international shipping was for ~120$ setup. Would love to get this but its beyond my reach. If you work and live in Germany or earn in Euro i bet its not that pricey compared to others products. But in my case it is. Also i would like to test it before i get MLFB and just paying for  fake one to test is silly."
mflb,3a2dhb,seruch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:48:33 2015 UTC,Where in Europe do you live? I would not recommend buying a fake one. I never read anything good about them.

mflb,3a2dhb,seruch,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:31:53 2015 UTC,"Yea i know you got lifetime warranty but its like i wrote before: in price of MFLB i can get 3 and a half of those fakes, and it wonders my how much it cost to produce MFLB and whats the difference between them. Ordering from US can complicate if box get to customs. Also getting them for 100€ is luck. Lowest i saw on domesticated market was something about 120E + good batteries and grinder it gets you about 160E overall. Bit pricey."
mflb,3a2dhb,TijuanaFlow,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:59:36 2015 UTC,"You don't need to buy new batteries right at the start and you can get a good grinder for 10€.  I guess you're living in the EU, so you could easily buy from Germany (if you don't live here) and get it delivered to your country with no customs, as 100€ is the regular price here in Germany. I highly recommend you to get the real MFLB. If you want to test vaping in general, you could build a vapor bulb (just google it). And then go with the origibal LB, as it is by far worth the money."
mflb,3a2dhb,CptRotzbarbe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:52:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think its too expensive. You should keep in mind that prices in the US are pictured without VAT. Prices in Europe usually already include the sales tax. In Germany you pay around 100€ (or 112$) for a box but that includes a 19% tax. VATs are around 20% in Europe and with that significantly higher than in the states. This explaines part of total the price difference. I don't think you save money if you order it from the US because of postage and a risk premium for the customs (if they get the box, it's for sure going to be more expensive). I think prices in the EU are kind of fair if you think about the fact that we get the same service. Equipment may be more expensive though. For the PA you pay around 70€ and the finishing grinder goes for 25€."

mflb,3a1147,VetNovice,2,Tue Jun 16 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"1  I personally like it the most. I'd choose 1. But I'll tell you my thoughts about 2 + 3.  Reason being the visual elements split by the thin and thick lines to simulate value from far away contrast well to my eye. Their variations in size and shape feel the most deliberate and interconnected, the tessellations mix up into different fractal shapes that break up smaller negative spaces in iconic ways for my brain to handle. I'm able to get absorbed by the smaller spaces easier because there is good breakup of visual elements, and a lot of the designs imply rotations in between, and stillness in contrast to that like the double dotted diamonds.  2 I feel could use better radial spacing of the elements. The way I would go about it is draw a line from the center of the circle, and then see how it splits up to the intersecting lines of the pattern. Then mark every intersection. It should give you a good chart on how the space is broken up. Mixing those spaces up in order of size might help push this to further completion in my eyes. I think I would add smaller circles or tiny highlight tessellations implied by the erased grey to break up the spaces in small clever ways. Or perhaps drawing small line shapes to have the designs interweave more in no 1 will give it more unity while emphasizing or pushing smaller passages to give us key landmarks for us to focus on.  3 for me conceptually was the coolest, and I'm the most excited about this one, but I want to see variations of its spacing more, if that makes sense. I feel like the concept of movement and interweaving negative + positive spaces will bring the idea of fusion to the next level. Perhaps playing with overlaying patterns to give more volume to the space then erasing it back down could give interesting ideas.  It's hard for me to visually describe stuff without providing examples, so my apologies if I describe my issues with ambiguity, I hope you get the feel of what I'm going for! Also take all of my advice with a grain of salt, these are just observations I'm trying to make out of my thought process behind choosing my favorite.  I hope it helps!"
mflb,3a1147,Bram_Bram,2,Wed Jun 17 02:14:00 2015 UTC,"I like what you've done in the first section by making the trench visible. I think that it is preference for a number of users to be able to see the trench. Though some may complain about lack of visibility I can't imagine too many people kicking up a fuss because they can see their trench. So to sum all that up, I think no matter the design I would personally appreciate a clear view. (Plus I think it looks cool. :D)  As far as design goes I am completely head over heels in love with your first one. I love the way it radiates out and that the circular shape of the blank space is continued/echoes. I like that it continues on throughout the whole box (no white edges) and that when it does end, it cuts off in a beautiful way. No awkward endings. Its beautiful as a piece of art and a functional piece. aesthetically its smooth and very pleasing to look at. Now I'll cut myself off here because If I don't this will turn in to an art rant VERY quickly. But yes, adore the first one."

I can actually see a lot of life/nature in those geometric patterns: animals with eyes, mountains, trees, water. (You should consider colouring these if possible!)  For #2, the buddhist one, I like it except for the white space at the top. But colouring that in would actually fix it very nicely. (Mix of red, orange, and black?)  For #3, maybe try redesigning it around the trench area (keep that area clear, it looks like a lot of people like seeing their herb). Other than that the design is a pretty interesting idea and turned out well. I actually do like the almost Sun-like circle over the trench, so if you're getting rid of that, replace it with something equally cool :)"

Draw and hold battery for six seconds. Depress battery and continue drawing for six seconds. Repeat as desired.  That was a a somewhat ""foolproof"" way to vape - and once you get used to it, you can start to get fancier."
mflb,39xcyz,CannabisFan420,-1,Mon Jun 15 18:04:08 2015 UTC,It is adviced to hold the battery in for no more than 3-5 sec just sayin.

A couple months ago I had a fresh, 1-week (2nd trench loaded) launch box that I had just gotten replaced with the warranty. I loved it so much but I ended up losing it in a movie theater. I had it inside a ziplock bag along with my cleaning brush, in my shorts pocket. I must not have noticed that the bag slid out of my pocket, probably when I had my legs up resting on the railing in front of my row. It caused me a lot of anxiety as soon as I got home and realized I had lost my box.   I only just last Friday received my new box, and I'm taking better care of this one. I can't afford to replace them anymore.   I hope you are able to recover yours as soon as possible!"

mflb,39wym4,vapesncrepes,6,Mon Jun 15 14:02:47 2015 UTC,"This is pretty normal for a new box- because they have a fresh, unused trench, and brand new glyph batteries.   After using the box a little bit, the metal in the trench gains a coating of cannabinoids (thc, cbd etc), and this causes more resistance along the trench, meaning it takes slightly longer to heat up, and so you need to draw slower.  The biggest part in using the mflb is learning how to 'listen' to your box (through the temperature on your younger/mouth), and adjust your draw speed accordingly.  TL;DR: Don't worry about it, this is normal, draw faster until you've used the box a little bit, and soon the trench will start to run a little 'cooler', needing a slower draw like your friends mentioned."
mflb,39wym4,Herbalist33,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:27:50 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the info! This is great news I was pretty worried as other users on this subreddit expressed great worry over accidentally combusting the goods haha.

mflb,39wym4,VetNovice,2,Tue Jun 16 00:56:08 2015 UTC,"Don't trust what you see, trust what you feel. Get used to breathing right from the get go. Breathe super slow when you start until you feel it heat up, then clench and unclench the battery to adjust the heat as you breathe in. Play with how fast you breathe + how you clench / unclench then find a comfort zone for you.   Hit it native. Every hit you take will be different, depending what your air quality is like around you, and how vapor builds up inside the herb.  It's like playing Smash Bros to me. I try to mix up my approaches to get a better sense of the mechanics for the MFLB and Smash."

When you peel off a battery cover the whole cylinder acts as the negative side so having the positive side can make it really easy to short on say a pair of keys or something.
mflb,39vncg,frommaplesteeze,7,Mon Jun 15 16:43:21 2015 UTC,I put it in backwards with the cap over the pointy end when I transport it so I don't accidentally turn it on.

Isopropyl is a common solvent which is exactly what you need, the polar peroxide wont do anything to the non polar resin. The diluted peroxide won't do anything, and you'll just get chemical burns with concentrated peroxide.

mflb,39torz,MrFahrenheit39,11,Sun Jun 14 17:56:00 2015 UTC,I have never looked at it in this way and when you summed up the price it honestly startled me. But then I looked at it this way:  In my opinion (as a glyph and PA owner) you get two totally different experiences with the mflb. I feel as is the 80$ were invested in a awesome tabletop at home vape and the other 120$ on a great portable vaporizer.  I feel like I have purchased two  different vaporizers for on 200$ judging on my own personal experience with them. It is awesome this little versatile box creates different images for each owner.  Vape on!
mflb,39torz,pyromaniacc,2,Sun Jun 14 23:41:54 2015 UTC,Great perspective!  Makes the PA worth it when you put it that way.
mflb,39torz,happyself,2,Mon Jun 15 14:09:15 2015 UTC,Thats exactly what I thought. The mflb is an amazing portable and a quite good desk vape. I had my mflb for 4 years before I decided to buy the PA. Reason is I have my own place now and wanted a tabletop vape for sessions at home. Buying the PA is by far the best bargain in a situation like that.

I guess what differs in my opinion is that I don't look at my launch box as a comparison to other vapes, because it really isn't like anything else. There's a simplicity in mflbs that you don't get with other vapes, along with operating like no other vape does. So in a sense, I don't look at the money put in as a ""I could have bought a vape for x amount instead."" I look at it instead as an investment in a product that I like. Just like there are cases in other markets of more financially sound options but people still buying the product they like more (ex. iphones)   I bought everything because I liked my mflb. I wanted to make it the best I could. I regret nothing and absolutely love everything about my mflb."

I love the PA but recognize that if you're a heavy user, you're forced to use the PA. That makes for a really nerfed experience since you're forced to be tied to an outlet.  I guess its all down to the aesthetic and ethnos because other than that, better vapes in the price range of an orbitor+pa+lb combo"

That being said, I have 2 boxes and kits, the Orbiter and a couple extra knock-off batteries, brushes, stems... all said and done I've got $350 into MF.  I wanted the PA too, but saw the Mighty on sale for $328 so I pulled the trigger, foregoing the PA.  Now if I want a PA experience, I use the Mighty.  I like my vapes to be cord free, and able to move around.

People often buy the MFLB as their first vape.  So they are not willing to shell out 220$ on something, a vaporizer, they are not even sure to like compared to smoking.    The PA is not essential to enjoy your MFLB fully.  You can get top performance with batteries.  But the PA is also a game changer which improve the MFLB a lot.  Other vaporizers are game changers in their own way (some have temperature control, convection heating, longer battery life, smoother and denser vapor, etc) but the MFLB can be considered a top vaporizer, the same as other popular vaporizers (Pax, Air, DaVinci, Haze, etc).  I still use it as a portable, it needs new batteries, but in general it still does the job.  Beside, it's fun to have a PA or a desktop vaporizer and not have to deal with the batteries when vaping at home."

You're still paying the price of a higher end vape in the end though.   The PA is not essential to enjoy your MFLB fully. You can get top performance with batteries. But the PA is also a game changer which improve the MFLB a lot.   If it improves your MFLB and is a game changer, then it sounds like it's pretty essential to me."
mflb,39torz,WoodyWeedpecker,4,Sun Jun 14 19:40:47 2015 UTC,I don't consider other vapes as higher end.  They are just different in the way they provide heated herb vapor to you.  Something that improves things a lot is not essential.  Water is essential.  A nice glass of quality wine is not but can be truly enjoyable for some people.  Both will provide you some water for your body.  The PA is not essential but improves the MFLB.
mflb,39torz,surprise07,3,Sun Jun 14 19:53:57 2015 UTC,"The PA removes the portability? What? It doesn't make you unable to use batteries anymore, it just allows you to not screw with them when you have access to power. I used batteries alone for the first year, when my last set of batteries were loosing their steam, I bought a PA. It's more convenient when your sharing with a group because you know everyone will get a good pull and you don't have to monitor battery levels. I use it when I'm home, or when I'm camping I can use the car and not worry about batteries dying. When I go to public events or am out and about I can use batteries. I think it's a great accessory to have the option to get. Do you need it? Of course not. If it's too expensive for you or makes the MFLB too pricey in your opinion, then don't buy it. That's the point of accessories, you don't need them, but they do usually improve the experience of something."

That's all I need and I don't really have any desire for anything else, vape or accessory wise.   I first bought it years ago, I want to say within the first couple of years it was released but I don't exactly remember when I got it. I remember seeing posts on GrassCity about version 2.0 or something of the sort right before I bought it. (I've been using it rather frequently since then as you can see :P)  I've always loved it for it's minimalistic style, and all these newfangled accessories just feel so unnecessary for me. Not that I dislike them, they look really neat actually and I would love to use one someday but I wouldn't use them frequently so it's pointless to buy them.

In my opinion it makes the brand so much more exciting for it to offer cool and premium accessories to make your experience even better.   The box by itself, as you noted, is hectic for the amount of control you get, and how high you get off of small amounts of weed in my opinion (against the da Buddha and flowermate mini at least as I own these two).  But then if you want to make it even better you can chuck in a bit more to get some well made, aesthetically pleasing and quality accessories.   I've made my own bubbler as have most, and can honestly say it does the job, but I also see the desire to have a set of accessories that work so well together. It makes me feel like some kind of scientist with all the equipment, and then if you want to go ahead and just take the essentials you can grab the box a battery and a tube(which you don't really need even) and go for a walk and you'll still get lit."

mflb,39sk5x,rlaitinen,7,Sun Jun 14 13:46:38 2015 UTC,Same! Works much better than isopropyl alcohol.

mflb,39sk5x,PopShark,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Most isopropyl alcohols are 91% at most, so I'm sure there's something that gets left behind there, as well."
mflb,39sk5x,123-45-6789,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:33:02 2015 UTC,When a solvent is used pure (100%) it leaves absolutely nothing behind.   I can't say the same about that 91% ISO many of my fellow ents have settled for.
mflb,39sk5x,stereo440,3,Sat Jun 20 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"It's fine where it works (glass) but it can cloud the finish on wood and plastic, and remove the printing on glass (which is a huge plus if intended) - it works much better as a cleanser but I like to not let pieces get to the point where alcohol wasn't strong enough.   If you have dirty glass with weird corners though there's no comparison."

mflb,39sk5x,rlaitinen,2,Mon Jun 15 00:11:12 2015 UTC,I'm pretty thorough with each brush clean! I always try and fish out as much as I can between the folds in the screen from each corner too. Seems to have helped.

mflb,39sk5x,WoodyWeedpecker,2,Tue Jun 16 21:05:05 2015 UTC,Bought my walnut box in August last year. Its probably used in average 3-4 times a week. I have never combusted in it and have only ever brush cleaned. The only buildup is on the rails - this is a kind of harder fibrous resin which the brush isn't capable of shifting. Function still seems great. I will ISO clean at some point soon and post results. Post your box!

mflb,39u8uf,I_Submit_This,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:14:57 2015 UTC,if your main requirement is harvestability ... no. no wooden stem is a good choice.    but if texture and aesthetic appeal & feel are important ... wood is good.    and if you want/like even more aesthetics and feel-appeal it's with the dart stem.
mflb,39u8uf,4nal,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"I use my dart with friends and the glass stem when alone. This way i can still get some oil but I don't have to worry about one of my friends accidentally breaking the stem (happened once).   Personally, I prefer the glass stem. It is easier and works better for my drawing technique. The dart stem does work well but in no way is it a necessity."
mflb,39tcbl,Official_Jar-Jar,2,Sun Jun 14 16:04:48 2015 UTC,I too used to have to store it in a drawer of dryer sheets... Oh god.  It will pass if you keep using the box as normal away from the sheets. I've had my current box absorb all kinds of unwanted flavours (iso alchohol is my least favourite) but they all disappear within a few days break from the odour.
mflb,39tcbl,acre_,2,Sun Jun 14 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"You don't want dryer sheets anywhere near your herb or pieces/vapes. That awful flavor stays with you.  Try vaping tea (mmm apple cinnamon), and keep tea in the trench when not in use. If anything, an ISO wash wouldn't hurt."

mflb,39pekq,4nal,2,Sun Jun 14 02:55:41 2015 UTC,The older mflb models didn't have the tiny circle bump to lock the lid in place so many people used the rubber band method. I guess some people just like the extra safety so that's why they still use it.

Magic flight recommends you don't clean where the bars are because the residue sticks so much that removing it actually removes parts of the screen as well. If screen is removed here then the box actually can't heat up. For those who have done this already look at the parts you cleaned and look for spots which are more silver, these are breakthrough locations. Goodluck"
mflb,39q8ai,Summerrocks95,3,Sat Jun 13 18:16:03 2015 UTC,Go native mode. It's the easiest way to control the temperature as well and you don't have to carry the stem around you. ;)

mflb,39q8ai,TwinMalaysia,3,Sun Jun 14 12:35:14 2015 UTC,Just put your upper lip a bit higher. Like where the glass cover starts. It won't burn then.

So do the solo/air/flowermate, and their components not need cleaning or maintenance?

Push in the battery for ~10 seconds with the lid open and you will see vapor pour out the top. Then clean with an iso q-tip. Repeat. It won't look new but it will be better.

mflb,39tae5,MrFahrenheit39,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:39:20 2015 UTC,"The real pain in the ass is that when you shake the box, weed goes under the glass screen, not the trench bit but the bit between wood and glass, and more shaking leads to it having a little trail going down to the metal circle bit, as a result theres a few crumbs trapped where the glass screen is connected by the metal ""hook"", and theres a fair amount of weed stuck to the metal bit/lodged.    I feel your pain. My best method for dealing with this is just opening the box and brushing the weed off during a session, which can be a bit annoying when you're fifteen minutes in."

mflb,39rijh,CausersOfThis,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:07:47 2015 UTC,The wood has probably absorbed a lot of oil. You can try cleaning out the trench with ISO and even under the screen to lessen it but if it stinks that bad it's probably all in there.

mflb,39nxtr,Splingy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:56:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion. The nose-inhale method is good for running the Box hotter because you're still drawing through your mouth, just much more slowly. If you can draw very very slowly, almost as if you're filling your mouth with vapor instead of your lungs, especially at the beginning of the hit then you can imitate what's going on without rerouting air. So depending on your breath control, you may or may not actually need to inhale through the nose. But it's probably a good workaround if you can't breathe that slowly through the mouth alone."

The irritation is simply the hot vapor condensing on the back of your throat. I like to have the vapor hit my tongue so it cools down as it goes over and to the back of my throat.  Are you Turkish? I've been to Turkey many times to visit grandparents and family. I loved Istanbul and Izmir. I was lucky enough to smoke with some new friends that had white widow plants from Amsterdam. How common was herb smoking back in Turkey?  Good luck to you
mflb,39lq4g,torof,2,Fri Jun 12 17:31:55 2015 UTC,"Nope, not Turkish! I served over four years in the military and I was on a nine month stint in Europe, Istanbul was one of our ports of call.  We used concentrates in Turkey.  I'm not sure how common the herb usage was, but we didn't have any problem finding it. Two years later I was over there and scored some Moroccan herb that was to die for.     A quick question!  When not going native but using the stem, how do you gauge the temp of the vapor?  It's easy to do when going native!  Do you watch the vapor in the stem?  I just want to do my best to not combust."

mflb,39lq4g,beerandabike,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:29:54 2015 UTC,"Your problem was using VG. VG is not a solvent, PG is. I followed a guide on YouTube on how to do it, but I basically just took 7g of AVB and turned it into powder with my kitchen grinder. I then decarbed it for about 45 min at 230 in my oven on a cookie sheet (cover with tinfoil to contain any vapor). I then simmered the PG with the decarbed powder in it for about an hour at 220-275 I think (you really want a thermometer).  Filter the powder with like 8 layers of cheese cloth or a coffee filter, dilute with VG to your desired ratio, and enjoy. If you're trying for high VG juice, I'd make it with a ratio of about 1.5-2:1 PG:AVB, but I wanted 50/50 for my tank so I think used 24ml of PG for 7g of avb and then diluted with 24ml of VG for a final total of 47.something ml of 50/50 and it got me pretty fucked up off about 8 or 9 puffs."
mflb,39lq4g,ExPwN,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"But VG is a sugar alcohol and is used as a solvent and carrier in non-alcohol tinctures. Mine definitely smells and tastes of bud (and popcorny ABV). Might be that PG is just a better solvent. Could also be that I only used about 2.5g to make just shy of 15ml.  Also, why decarb already decarbed ABV?"

Going from nothing to the orbiter did a LOT to help with coughing and heat issues and made doing oils possible, having a UFO or two helps even more and I like having the space for it to cool and collect. Did you not have something to strap the UFO down with, or did the way you set it up make your pull too difficult?"
mflb,39kcy4,ADHDABE,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:37:23 2015 UTC,I used rubber bands but for how I use the LB it's just not a good use of stuff. I prefer my orbiter straight. I haven't actually made the 2 way since i had just received my ufo.

mflb,39kcy4,ADHDABE,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:28:27 2015 UTC,Drawing was a pain compared to orbiter and it provided almost too much filtration. Works better with the MD than MFLB
mflb,39kcy4,skrew_,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"too much filtration, or too much draw resistance, or both?"

mflb,39ng7v,I_Submit_This,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:23:06 2015 UTC,get the battery really warm/hot by charging it or discharging it somehow in the mflb (little cut for contact). when its hot it is pretty easy to peel off. rest is done with some iso rubbing. gl mate
mflb,39ng7v,thebotguy,0,Sat Jun 13 01:27:24 2015 UTC,"many, many ways.    some solvents work well, some need a lot of rubbing along with,  and some just don't do much at all. every manufacturer uses different label and adhesive material, so a solvent approach can be ""ah'll be bahk"" hit or miss.    dry, non-solvent removal can require (and often ends up using), a lot of elbow grease.    the easiest, dry way is to peel off the label, then start rubbing (in one || direction, end-to-end), with a common, pink pencil eraser (or an ""artists' bar"" of the same material is a bit easier to hold & control), then polish/buff with a paper towel, (dry or solvented)."
mflb,39mgng,Ryuuken1127,3,Fri Jun 12 19:48:58 2015 UTC,As long as it stops the nope end touching metal it will work fine.  At a pinch you can wrap the end in tape so a nice battery case will work fine.

Melee, walk at night for a good 2 hours and talk about interesting connections between the world, art, and how we see it. Game theory stuff, etc. We even have gone swimming, or done weights. Excellent stuff. I used to be a Sativa guy, but now I just love weed and everything it is. Vaping makes every day a new experience, an incredible change to learn. I also have a Finishing Grinder and P.A. 2.  I also bought the Orbiter / UFO. Don't get them if you're pro.  I got a Maud'Dib. Might be even better than the MFLB, more efficient with small dabs (big ones just bubble and go to waste) too. I can make $30 of wax last me a month or so with friends.  I hit both of them native.

I'm thinking of buying one for myself (ironically for another vaporizer).  I use a coffee grinder at the moment but would like the convenience of the FG.  I want to see how fine the grind is and you got a great cam for it.

mflb,39gyes,TehFuckDoIKnow,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:07:02 2015 UTC,What were some techniques you used to get as fine a grind as possible with your old grinder? If you don't mind me asking.
mflb,39gyes,I_Vape,3,Thu Jun 11 21:45:00 2015 UTC,The only real technique I used was grinding it upside down for a bit before flipping it back over and completing the grind. You could also break the nugs up a bit beforehand.
mflb,39gyes,HSV1896,2,Thu Jun 11 22:31:17 2015 UTC,I got my box two days ago and am using a 4-piece grinder. Thinking of using my old two-piece to get a bit of a finer grind but I can't find it right now... so right now I'm doing the same. I also after vaping it I stick it back in my grinder and grind it up some more since it's a little more dry... seems to help. Think I'm eventually just going to pick up the finishing grinder though.
mflb,39gyes,lnt_,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:34:59 2015 UTC,Yeah man go for it. The perfect fit on the box prevents any bud from being lost.
mflb,39lhhf,a_per_son,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:52:28 2015 UTC,Unusual problem. .... You are displaying the symptoms of PA failure.  But this is very uncommon in brand new PAs. You have just warrantied yours and it tends to be a issue with older models.   You are also really talking about 2 problems as the battery is a separate issue.  How old are your batteries and where did you get them from? They need replacing every 6 months to a year so perhaps it's time you got a new set?   Give us some more information and we'll be able to help you more.
mflb,39jvik,AppiusClaudiusCaecus,3,Fri Jun 12 06:11:59 2015 UTC,"Patience, grasshopper"
mflb,39jvik,Intracelestial,2,Fri Jun 12 15:57:35 2015 UTC,I go through a 2g a week. That's 8g a month.   I harvest every 3 months or so.    Which is 24g through the stem. Roughly an ounce.   I'm afraid it's not how high you get that dictates your oil build up but the amount of herb and the amount of oils in the plant material.   If you are only doing a g a month the It could be a year or more.  Sorry for the bad news buddy but your usage is extremely low. You gotta vape more for there to be more residue. You don't get anything for free.    The good news is that with a very low tolerance you won't need a super dark stem to feel something.  However you still need much more than is pictured.  Keep saving buddy!
mflb,39jvik,Ressotami,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:10:58 2015 UTC,So u vaped about 1/8 oz. in 4 months.  I expect it to look exactly like it does.
mflb,39jvik,ParsInterarticularis,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:26:02 2015 UTC,You look to be on track. Heavy buildup is often from taking too large of a drag and not fully clearing the box and stem of vapor. An oily box/stem could be a sign of inefficient use for a moderate user.
mflb,39jvik,JPTobes,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:00:20 2015 UTC,"I've had mine for almost 8 months and haven't milked once. It actually depends on a lot of factors. The slower the draw the more time the vapor has to cool and stick to the stem, this also increases with higher temperatures."
mflb,39jvik,lersday,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely something is wrong, I vape as little as 0.15 g per day, which equals to about 4 g a month, and I Guarantee you that after that 4 g my stem looks oily, definitely much more than your... weird... :)"

mflb,39j06c,flysctysfinest,2,Fri Jun 12 01:33:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. Can confirm. Have used an oxygen tube whip for a few months. Don't go over about 14 inches though. The draw gets a little tough. 12 is ideal and the vapor will be so smooth and cool you won't even notice it....so be careful , enjoy!"
mflb,39j06c,vape_dad,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:37:02 2015 UTC,Does it ever heat up near the stem? I'm just wanting to make sure all that I'm inhaling is vapor and not a harmful chemical from exposing it to heat

mflb,39geli,hesterdum,9,Thu Jun 11 15:28:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here are giving advice that isn't very good.  ""Vape it. What's the worst that could happen?"" Easy for them to say as they're not the ones putting it in their box.  My advice will be slightly more scientific. The fillers in the pill are not designed to be heated and inhaled.  They could decompose to form toxic gasses or by products. I stress could.  But it's not as easy and care free as some might try to tell you.  I recommend not vaping it. One of the key points of vaping is its healthier. I wouldn't want pill filler in my box or my lungs and they also could potentially melt and damage your screen.    Up to you buddy.   Edit: more research on the ingredients listed. Dicalcium phosphate decomposes in the presence of water to form phosphoric acid and the magnesium stearate melts at 88 degrees c.  So none of this is good for you or your box. Don't do it buddy."
mflb,39geli,Ressotami,6,Fri Jun 12 17:21:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't risk it, you should throw it out honestly. You're going to lose a 0.3g at most, don't feel bad about it."

The pill bottle has these things listed as ingredients for the pills:  Dicalcium phosphate  Crystalline cellulose  Magnesium stearate  Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol)  Is it okay to vape you think, or did I screw myself over? :D"
mflb,39geli,followthedamntrain,2,Thu Jun 11 15:32:41 2015 UTC,"No no, I didn't put a pill in my MFLB. I used a pill bottle to finish my weed so that it is very fine using an empty pill bottle that apparently still had residue from the pills that it used to hold. Read more on the method here.  I am just asking if the weed that came out of that bottle, which I can see clearly has pill residue in it, is still okay to vape? :)"
mflb,39geli,iridescentcosmicslop,3,Thu Jun 11 15:41:26 2015 UTC,It's probably safer to not vape it honestly.   Maybe save it for a time when you make cannabutter or something with AVB?

mflb,39gooe,Packupabowldud3,2,Thu Jun 11 16:34:10 2015 UTC,I use a full trench of kief all the time. Havent ever had any problems
mflb,39gooe,_dabnation_,2,Thu Jun 11 17:09:27 2015 UTC,"I see this question often on here, so I'll have to make a tutorial. One BIG improvement in using kief in the MFLB is buying a PA.   The PA allows you to control the temp down to a nice low heat. The low heat setting gives the kief time to melt together into a clump, but it's not so hot that the kief melts through the screen.   On the first draw, immediately after sipping, I leave the heat on and tap the MFLB. The heat allows the kief to dislodge and you'll see that a little loaf of kief is able to be flipped.  I flip the kief by tapping the box at an angle away from me which slides the kief loaf up the side of the trench, then I rock box back and the loaf flips to the uncooked side.   Now reheat and sip. Follow the process above and you should have either one large kief loaf, or a couple smaller loaf pieces.   The hard part is done. Enjoy your kief until it is very dark, then toss it in with the rest of your avb. The vaped kief boosts the quality of your avb exponentially.  -Rock on austinrobots"

mflb,39b4w1,Ressotami,3,Thu Jun 11 12:53:15 2015 UTC,kief straight from the grinder is not decarbed.
mflb,39b4w1,I_Submit_This,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:59:19 2015 UTC,"Ahhh....I thought not. In OP's case then, eating it would be lots of fun but would represent a bit of waste as the powder he has coated the oil with would not be biologically available.  Once the oils coated in kief, I guess you need to consume it with some heat (could still make firecrackers or cook with it though)"
mflb,39b4w1,Ressotami,2,Thu Jun 11 13:03:45 2015 UTC,"exactly, and while not much kief is there, kief is somewhat like oil/concentrates ... a small bit represents [a lot].    you would have to do a full-on firecrackerey decarb to convert the kief. but again this is a tiny amount of kief, and that amount of oil just consumed as-is, would overpower any effects from that kief, even if decarbed."

I simply took some ground bud and tightly pushed it into one end of the stem. I then used a wooden skewer to push the nug slowly throught the stem.

AND - when you do the 'sip' method - it is very very very light sip, and don't be afraid to open your mouth and take a larger breath in between sips.  I was finding that my inhales were limited b/c the mflb takes a few seconds between sips.  Trying to hold my breath, while taking itty bitty sips of air/vape and focusing were too much to enjoy the experience.  You don't lose any vape by opening your mouth a little wider and taking in oxygen."

mflb,39bm4t,Ressotami,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"It's unlikely to have come from the box. However, from memory, the wires used in the manufacture are gold at the beginning  (a new trench has a gold sheen which quickly fades to silver) so I suppose it could be a single filament left over from the trench screen.  As long as it isn't attached then carefully remove it with tweezers and vape on bruvva. It's certainly not crucial to the function of the box."
mflb,39bm4t,stereo440,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"That looks like it could definitely be from the trench.

mflb,393w4t,warfrogs,3,Fri Jun 12 19:38:01 2015 UTC,Don't forget to save your AVB. Make Cannaoil with it... and now I've learned to make treats with the left over plant matter AFTER I've made cannaoil.
mflb,393w4t,notforthekidsaccount,-2,Mon Jun 15 02:19:39 2015 UTC,please reply to this comment with a direct link to that process.
mflb,393w4t,I_Submit_This,6,Mon Jun 15 02:30:17 2015 UTC,"No link, developed via experimenting...  1) Make your cannaoil, recipes everywhere for this, but I use a 10g AVB to 100ml coconut oil ratio. Strain with cheese cloth as much as possible. 2) Allow plant matter in cheese cloth to dry out (perhaps not necessary), and add to mason jar. Add very hot (almost boiling) water and fill up the jar. Allow to cool in fridge over night. 3) At this point, if you haven't squeezed out all the oil in the cannaoil process, the oil should rise to the top, leaving you with a little oil puck. More cannaoil. I had 0 rise to the top. 4) If you did squeeze out all the oil during the cannaoil process, you'll be left with brown water with the plant matter at the bottom. Strain this, all you want is the dark brown plant matter. Allow to dry. (Water cured?) 5) Grind the plant matter further. 6) Using double boiler, melt 1/4c chocolate (I use the darkest I can find, 85% in this case), 1/4c coconut oil (not cannaoil) and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. 7) Once melted, pour into candy or chocolate molds and chill.    Store in freezer, these will melt at room temp.    Strength - This left over plant matter is about 25% as strong as the cannaoil in terms of a high. If I made this chocolate with cannaoil, 1/2 a treat would get me baked. With the plant matter, 2 treats would be in order... just to give you an idea of what is left in the plant matter.    Vape flower -> AVB into cannaoil > Left over plant matter into chocolate. 0 waste.    Can't wait to make things with stems, leaves, & roots (most likely tinctures) at the end of the season. 00 waste!"

mflb,395ekf,I_Submit_This,2,Tue Jun 9 13:32:16 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the darker you vape the AVB allow for more THC to collect on the stem?
mflb,395ekf,Dstrunk,7,Tue Jun 9 16:51:55 2015 UTC,"much of the THC is vaporized within the first several hits. the darker you take your ABV, the more higher temp cannabinoids also start vaporizing and condensing, but yes, THC is still there, and still depositing."
mflb,395ekf,I_Submit_This,2,Tue Jun 9 16:54:20 2015 UTC,"This is correct. I usually vape my material at low temp during the day which results in a light sandy brown abv and then I throw it in with some greens at night on high temps to relax and sleep without issues. If I just vaped the light brown abv by itself on high temp, I would get tired but I wouldn't really get high because a lot of the thc is vaporized at lower temps which is why I throw in some greens."

mflb,393h9b,faregonz,5,Tue Jun 9 00:04:41 2015 UTC,"So when you vape, you put the herb in the Launch Box. The Launch Box has a hole where the vapor comes out for you to inhale. Usually, people connect the stem (which comes with the Launch Box) to vape out of. When you vape through the stem, THC vapor that you inhale starts to stick and collect on the stem over time. Vape enough, and there'll be a ton of THC collected inside of the stem.   Common techniques to extract this THC are to either mix the stem with a drink or push a tiny nugget through the stem to coat it."

The most important thing is that your fathers box is now your own and must remain that way until you have a son to pass it down to. It's become one of those family things, sort of undescribably human to have heirlooms isn't it? But there it is.... I strongly feel that it was meant to be for you and perhaps when you are feeling lost and needing a bit of guidance, you might feel him just chilling with you as you use it. Sometimes objects can have that sort of power and through our memories, they become gifted with the power to listen or advise.  I think that it's actually your old box that needs to be given a new job to do. Keep your dads for your own everyday use (walnut is awesome too) So my suggestion is this. Pass on the love.  My old box is on permanent, non binding loan to a close friend. And I have no intention of asking for it back unless I need to. I packed it into its tin, with the charger and 2 new glyphs and I gave it away to someone who I felt would benefit from being healthier, wealthier and wiser! (as one of the MF aphorisms goes)   He uses it all the time, his GF is a lot happier that he isn't smoking and overall it feels like it was the right thing to do.   It still belongs to me and I would be upset if he sold it without asking me. But I have no need to leave it in a drawer at home. Would much rather it's getting its legs stretched elsewhere.

When I got my 2nd MFLB (maple w/a pineapple etching), the first one (walnut) was used almost exclusively for concentrates. I prefer using one exclusively for concentrates because the reclaim gets very sticky on the inside of the lid causing bud to stick to it way too easily. And it wasn't easy to clean either (I could get almost all of it off with some 99% iso, but there would always be just enough left to cause a couple pieces to stick.)

The one you squeeze would open in the bag, and the ones designed for pills would let some of the very fine powder out of the child safety lid if I didn't empty it.

While doing this, I sip, like from a straw (not too fast or it gets too cold and not too slow or you'll combust).  3) Sipping lowers the temp in the trench, so while the trench heats back up between sips, deposit the air in your mouth into your lungs.  4) Continue to sip/deposit until your lungs are ~85% full, being careful to not cause combustion (the temp of which you'll get used to feeling).  5) Release/pull the battery, take mouth off mflb, and inhale a bit more so you cool your lungs down and get a nice full breath.  6) Turn over mflb, smack with thumb a few times, shake left to right, and go at it with the brush if necessary to redistribute the herb.  7) Hold air in lungs like an inhaler (after all, it's medicine =D) and exhale slowly through nose or mouth when you feel your lungs have absorbed as much as they're going to.  8) Repeat and enjoy."

However if this is untrue I'd love to know! :)
mflb,38t1tr,MegasOros,2,Sat Jun 6 21:14:24 2015 UTC,maybe raw abv? you probably wont notice a difference in effect if the weed is the same amount and same potency
mflb,38t1tr,Roundnotboxxy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:06:23 2015 UTC,Coconut oil has a higher total fat count than butter and the fat us what dissolves all the goodies because fat is nonpolar. The the more fat the more potent it will be.

mflb,38r4m1,bitcasual,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:26:42 2015 UTC,I recently bought a Chromium Crusher and have been very happy with it: http://www.amazon.com/Chromium-Crusher-Piece-Tobacco-Grinder/dp/B00ELRSO60
mflb,38r4m1,boredymcbored,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"I just use the nano grinder. I use nail scissors to cut smaller pieces of the larger nug into something that fits the nano. I've been thinking about getting the finishing grinder, but I can't justify the purchase as the nano grinds my material perfectly."
mflb,38r4m1,morvis,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:46:08 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing until I got the finisher. Worth the price by far IMO. They really weren't lying about increased vapor production.

mflb,38r4m1,nogitsunes,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:08:00 2015 UTC,"I start with a Sharpstone 4-piece grinder and follow that up with a 30+ second shake in the cheapo finishing grinder (Medicine Bottle + Coins). Very effective for hits and fineness, but a little hard to shake once it's in the box; I've found that sometimes it sticks to the trench despite my best efforts."
mflb,38rd11,MrWeaD,4,Sat Jun 6 03:57:45 2015 UTC,"If everything's working properly, you really shouldn't see sparks. The power adapter can push a fair bit of juice, but only at a voltage far too low to cause arcing. My guess is that some of the material in your trench flashed alight - if the sparks were yellow, rather than blue, that's definitely a flame rather than an electrical arc."
mflb,38rd11,aitigie,3,Sat Jun 6 05:15:19 2015 UTC,"Yea i know.  I have used my box quite a bit.  I have had the pa for months,  and i have never seen this before.  I dusted the trench clean,  as i always do before using the trays. Popped a little hashball on the tray,  and fired it up. About 10 seconds in it sparked,  and i was like ""did that just spark?"". I didn't disengage power,  and a few seconds later it sparked 2 times close together.  This wasn't epic or anything.  I didn't lose an eyebrow or anything. Like i say,  it was like a tiny lighter flick. Just wondering if anyone has seen it before, and possibly what to do about it."
mflb,38rd11,I_Submit_This,5,Sat Jun 6 08:09:37 2015 UTC,"anything sparklie inside the chamber is not electrical. it's tiny flecks of something combusting, or impurities in your concentrate.    there is no easy way to produce electrical sparks within the chamber.       Also my pa doesnt like higher settings. Have to dial up.     this is a  warrantable problem."

mflb,38r3ur,I_Submit_This,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:39:34 2015 UTC,Just tried with batts. It acts the same way I guess its the box. I watch as the light turned on for 2 seconds then cut off. Sometimes it works fine though.
mflb,38r3ur,I_Submit_This,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:14:16 2015 UTC,"use the warranty info in the sidebar, exactly, in order to use this box until your replacement arrives."
mflb,38pg7o,NearlyBaked,8,Fri Jun 5 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"One way you can check if it is ISO is to close the lid and engage. If it is ISO evaporating, it will evaporate and then condense on the lid causing little droplets to appear.   This does not happen with normal honey oil vapor. I use it as a test to see if my ISO has evaporated.  If you do see beading on the lid, it is a good idea to wipe them off and keep your lid free of ISO. It can cause some minor frosting of acrylic over time (crazing)  As the user said below, it's likely just other oils vaporising off from the corners of the trench. One other way is to take a single sip onto your tongue. You will know instantly if there is ISO by the taste. This isn't very healthy which is why I said sip onto your tongue instead of inhaling into your lungs."
mflb,38pg7o,Ressotami,4,Fri Jun 5 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"I evap off all the ISO with my power adaptor on 100%  Does the job, and I find that you can hit the box empty afterwards because some of the oil under the screen vaporizes."
mflb,38pg7o,unique_username_384,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:30:59 2015 UTC,"It's likely mostly honey oil burning off at this point I think. Next time, before you clean it, try hitting the empty trench until vapour stops blasting -- then clean it. At this point, if I were you, I would just put a fresh battery in and keep it pushed in with the lid open until the battery starts getting hot. Then let it sit for a couple hours just to be safe, the iso will eventually completely evaporate if it hasn't already."
mflb,38pg7o,borislab,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"That is not smoke, that is the resin that collects under the screen.   I have suggested Magic Flight release an update with a removable bottom to the box multiple times but as of yet it has not been made reality.   If you hold the power down for 30 seconds after cleaning and vapor is still coming out close the lid and start inhaling, you'll feel it."

mflb,38le76,marijuana_stabber,20,Thu Jun 4 23:39:34 2015 UTC,"stop direct inhaling to the lungs, instead sip into your mouth, let it cool a bit, them inhale with some ambient air. do this to ~80% lung capacity, then release power, inhale through box and mouth, and finish deeply to 100% with wide open mouth.    exhale after ~3 seconds with no visible exhale. if a cloud is exhaled, sip/inhale less vapor as you approach that 80% capacity."
mflb,38le76,I_Submit_This,4,Thu Jun 4 23:52:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not inhaling straight into my throat most of the time; I'll sometimes sip it in segments I guess, but the vapor itself just seems to really irritate the back of my throat and my lungs. Maybe I'm just a vaporlung lightweight; I'm rather new at this whole thing."
mflb,38le76,IAmAMustardAMA,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:55:56 2015 UTC,It's really hit or miss for me. It seems like some days it just hurts more than others
mflb,38le76,I_Submit_This,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:40:51 2015 UTC,"try making a DIY bubbler. i know that's not native, but moisturizing and cooling the vapor will help more than anything ... try using steamy water for extra moisture. it sounds self-defeating, but even below-boiling, steamy water is cooler than vapor."
mflb,38le76,ForScale,4,Thu Jun 4 23:58:32 2015 UTC,"I let it hit my tongue first, sit in my mouth for a bit... then inhale, hold, exhale."
mflb,38le76,pleen,2,Fri Jun 5 02:51:33 2015 UTC,"So when you take a hit, are you only inhaling as much as you can get in one mouthful?"
mflb,38le76,I_Submit_This,2,Fri Jun 5 03:34:46 2015 UTC,"This is why everyone should have been in their late teens or early 20's in the mid to late 90's. We all learned how to play the didgeridoo, and subsequently, circular breathing. If you can do it forwards, you can do it backwards.  Draw a little smoke into your mouth, letting it hit the bit of your tongue where you can best feel the temperature of vapor that works best with your rig. Sip gently by drawing your tongue back and/or lowering your jaw, but don't inhale through your mouth. Then inhale just a bit through your mouth, and repeat the cycle.  Basically keep your inhalations through your mouth to full of vapor, half full of air, full of vapor, then inhale the rest of the way through your nose. You will soon develop a rhythm through which you can breathe normally through your nose while drawing nice warm smoke into your mouth.  And then, if you're anything like me, you'll get to feeling too confident and then waste the best toke you ever did draw off that little fucker in a coughing fit.  Practice makes perfect, and there's not much I like to practice more than vaping."

mflb,38le76,I_Vape,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:51:48 2015 UTC,Hey! No... I don't fill up my whole mouth... maybe half? I guess I take little hits (sips) or a couple drags until I can feel a substantial presence of vapor in my mouth... but no not a whole mouthful at a time. Do it a few times (maybe 10 times throughout a sesh) and I become pretty stoned!
mflb,38le76,I_Vape,6,Fri Jun 5 13:16:53 2015 UTC,Never been a fan of native. The box tastes like salt and the vapour is hella hot. Maybes I need to just man up.
mflb,38le76,Beremat,2,Thu Jun 4 23:41:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah maaaan, that's how I've been feeling. I've always assumed it was the ""superior"" way plus I like the simplicity, but maybe it's actually worse."
mflb,38le76,I_Vape,6,Thu Jun 4 23:54:08 2015 UTC,It's great for keeping it stealthy but that's the only plus side to it.
mflb,38le76,Someonewhois,2,Fri Jun 5 10:48:34 2015 UTC,The box doesn't taste like anything except maybe a slight hint of wood... the salt is probably your sweat

mflb,38le76,joemofo214,3,Sat Jun 6 11:29:41 2015 UTC,Get a water pipe adapter and a cheap glass bubbler with a 14mm glass joint on the downstem. Fill that sucker with ice cold water and wonder why you did it any other way.   Not kidding. Makes it dangerously smooth.
mflb,38le76,Smokeswaytoomuch,3,Fri Jun 5 03:20:44 2015 UTC,"I keep my PA turned down to a hair less than Half, just take light pulls till I see vapor then do a slow steady draw till I feel all Toked up, I dunno I don't think the batteries were any different I've done Native with both for a good long while now, I actually find using the stem to be more harsh, I cough way more using the stem."
mflb,38le76,CausersOfThis,2,Fri Jun 5 05:00:02 2015 UTC,"I think it might actually be the batteries for me, because I get irritation much more with fresh batteries. PA at 3 or 4 might be just the ticket."

mflb,38le76,barrelsmasher,2,Fri Jun 5 08:26:59 2015 UTC,"Just be patient man, it's similar the bong when you first start it, it irritates, then it gets used to it. I switched from bongs to third lung and used to get a sore throat, it went away after a few days."
mflb,38le76,rosebowlriots,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:02:29 2015 UTC,"I sometimes have that problem when hitting it native. To try to minimize the vapor burn, I use a stem, and I tilt the box so that the stem is pointed at the bottom of my mouth. This really helps with cooling the vapor. Also, if you find the temperature a little too hot, you can always speed up your draw. But, probably like every other time I use my MFLB, I get super baked and forget all of this ""throat safety stuff"". I end up letting my trench get nice and hot as the vapor shoots directly into the back of my throat as I cough and feel like I just swallowed boiling water. But then, of course, I forget all of this right away 'cause I'm super baked."

mflb,38kqsy,Yeroc1422,18,Thu Jun 4 21:12:43 2015 UTC,"It's impossible to drag too hard. In this case, you actually either:   Didn't ""drag"" hard enough Didn't shake the trench enough Your material is too coarse (or not homologous in size) Waited too long to start to inhale Had a bit of herb stuck on the side of the trench that wasn't dislodged while shaking   All of these things will cause the trench to get too hot in certain areas, then make your herb combust (which the mark on your trench clearly indicates). It could be helpful for you to peruse the manual that came with your little box again. It does a great job explaining some of the ways to avoid combusting, and it explains the speed of inhaling relative to the trench temperature quite well. Also, feel free to utilize the search function here on /r/mflb, and then ask questions when you can't seem to find an appropriate answer.  Cheers, and happy flights!"

Well towards the end of the trench I was zoned out and didn't realize one of them was puffin a little smoke. Dumped the trench and it had burn mark. I flipped out. Later realized it was no biggie.

mflb,38jk0u,I_Submit_This,2,Thu Jun 4 17:37:46 2015 UTC,Interesting. Did not know that.  So is it possible to get a battery that isn't Lsd/hsd hybrid?  Are lsd batteries more powerful ?
mflb,38jk0u,I_Submit_This,8,Thu Jun 4 17:44:06 2015 UTC,"LSDs are below 2400 mAh, they're the original  design spec for NiMH batts. LSD means Low Self Discharge, which is why they will hold ~85% charge for months in storage.    HSDs (High Self Discharge), are the newer tech, they are above 2400 and approaching 3000mAh (higher mAh are likely marketing). they push their power out fast, but only hold that 85% for 5 or 6 hours. they're not dead, but are very low-charged.    glyphs are a proprietary hybrid of LSD and HSD tech, designed specifically by MFLB, for MFLBs. they hold that charge for 10-12 hours before dropping, but when engaged will push it  out as fast as HSDs. they also hold charge enough (when new), for 2+ trenches before seriously dropping.    LSDs are good for camping and times you're long away from AC power.    HSDs are best for shorter, mobile use, where AC is fairly easy to access.    glyphs are a bit of both, heavier on the HSD end for power output.    ... annnnd ... if you have a newer charger, it has a port for using it with a 12VDC supply using any car adapter that does not change voltage or amperage, and has the correct sized and polarity output plug."

mflb,38d5no,Princess_Goddamit,4,Wed Jun 3 14:18:37 2015 UTC,That's really wierd. I can't believe we had such different experiences. I have always thought the Magic Flight brush was practically indestructible. I have abused both my old white plastic one and my new wooden one LOADS and neither has fallen apart or lost a bristle.   The white one is about 5 years old and going strong!   I have no way to account for out vastly different experiences. Perhaps warmth of climate? I come from a relatively cool country. Maybe the heat is melting the glue of some people?
mflb,38d5no,Ressotami,0,Wed Jun 3 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"It is a mystery to me too. Cheap glue maybe. I could have fixed it, but the brush was of very poor quality anyway so I just tossed it. I figured it would just fall apart again."

mflb,38d5no,Bathingintacos,10,Wed Jun 3 14:37:59 2015 UTC,Easy fix tho. Either get some superglue or do what I did and treat it like a pencil eraser. Take some pliers or something like your teeth(BUT DONT USE YOUR TEETH....) And just bite it down on the metal to have the metal bend and stick into the wood in a few places. Now mines super sturdy.

mflb,38fwhm,worldlyplatypus,3,Wed Jun 3 23:11:44 2015 UTC,"The smell from the box itself is quite minimal. At first, it mostly smells like wood. After using my box for almost a year now, it honestly still doesn't smell too much. The biggest component of the box that actually smells is the glass stem. It has a noticeable vaped-weed smell, although this smell is still minimal enough that you only notice it when you put your nose right up to it. Despite this lack of a noticeable smell, do whatever makes you most comfortable, and keep in mind the tin is not air tight. If you store weed in the tin and don't take proper care to put the weed in another container, it will smell. It might not smells as much as leaving weed out in the open, but the smell will undoubtedly still be there.  It seems there's a consensus that the smelliest part of owning a MFLB is the actual herb that you use with it. I personally agree with this consensus in the MFLB community.

mflb,38e4q3,mflbach,4,Wed Jun 3 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"How about the glass orb in your design IS an orbiter! The orbiter is cradled in the centre of your wooden pyramid thing. But mounted flush into the wooden pyramid is also a launch box trench, built in. It could have a steampunky brass shutter and window over it a bit like the maud dib. It could even have a light illuminating the trench like the flowermate.   The vapour from the inline launch box trench is then channelled through nice looking copper/metal piping  out the side of the pyramid by the trench and up to the top where it enters the orbiter as normal whips do.   Then a normal glass joint out the side of the orbiter to the whip and perhaps a custom brass fitting mouthpiece.  Think that's awesome? Now try a little PA power wheel mounted along side the box. That's right, you can watch the trench, adjust power, watch the coloured gem lights and bubble it through the orbiter all in one compact little device. Boom. The perfect table top.  In terms of aesthetic, I found this image that gives an impression of the sort of thing I mean. Dark wood, pyramid with a glass bulb and some metal fittings. A really nice piece of art.  Clean air path? Any concern about the metal could be tackled with glass inner tubes that channel the vapor, sitting inside the metal so that the metal jackets the glass and just provides the looks while maintaining a clean vapour path. It would be more fiddly to build and not as strong however.  Sometimes I wish I was good at makin' stuff so I could craft the perfect device.  Edit: On second thought, I think there would have to be some sort of removable trench system, even if it just slid out the side in launch box form or had some kind of cartridge. Launch boxes are durable, but if you put a hole in the trench of that amazing tabletop, what the fuck would you do then? Warranty it? I think the easiest thing to do would be to go convection and have a system similar to other vaporisers such as a ceramic oven and convection heating element."

The temperatures are a bit off too, saying as the LB heating logistics work fine and so could be used within this.

mflb,38e4q3,I_Submit_This,3,Thu Jun 4 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"MFLBs don't do numbers. it's a more personal experience, where you learn what the box is telling you to do by the temp and taste on your tongue.    i never want to see anything ""digital"" on any MFLB product."
mflb,38e4q3,Pigsin5pace,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:02:31 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c  But I can see your point. I just feel that having an exact temperature would give you a more precise measurement than a feel. You can remember that you like your vapor at a specific temperature. I feel people will always post what is a good temperature to vape at or will have problems with combustion and a thermometer would eliminate a lot of those issues. I feel this is especially doable with a desktop unit because portability is less of a concern. But learning how to use the box is all part of the magic with the MLFB I just feel if there is a desktop unit from MFLB it should be more high tech because they would have the room to do so but then again a lot of desktop units have thermometers.
mflb,38e4q3,I_Submit_This,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:17:04 2015 UTC,"high tech, in a natural package ... with no numbers, would be fine ... but MFLBs are already very high tech from the inside out ... R&D wise, and with ongoing upgrades ... in a natural package, meant to be used with your senses, not relying on digital readouts that can limit you, and not be the best settings/readout for what is in the trench at the time."
mflb,38e4q3,Pigsin5pace,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:57:52 2015 UTC,I dont see how a thermometer could limit you. It gives you a precise reading so you know at what temperature you like your vapor. I am not saying the current box should have a thermometer I am just saying if MFLB were to make a big desktop unit that would be a nice feature. You could get a percipience reading and learn the feel of that reading so you can apply it on your box. I feel the whole finding the right temperature for the MFLB is a major turn off for people who are looking to by a dry herb vaporizer.
mflb,38e4q3,I_Submit_This,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:23:38 2015 UTC,"It gives you a precise reading   with low cost always a manufacturing option, devices like these use ""seconds"" that did not QC for accuracy, and are sold on the cheap.    unless it's certified lab quality, i don't trust the accuracy of vape readouts, they could easily be of by 10 degrees, and that's not accurate enough to fine tune some cannabinoid temps.    maybe an Herbalizer would be that precise."

mflb,38f0u4,sczombie,10,Wed Jun 3 19:55:39 2015 UTC,"The market has changed hugely but Magic Flight still find a niche. I guess people like the wooden vibes. In terms of performance, it's hard to compare oranges with apples. The pens are expensive but obviously provide immense ease and laxity of use. You can just plug and play and you're away. Flying.  The box is the same as it's always been. It's a manual, portable herbal vape. The power adapter always improves the experience and you only buy it once. Whereas obviously the cartridges are an ongoing cost.   I too, see the box as a conservation tool, not just for saving money, but for saving my health and minimizing any of the nasties I might inhale. And for eking out the very last crumbs and making every use count, it still has a place I think, even in the current scape. But similarly, the size and constant repetition of action quite closely mimic traditional smoking which is something I used to enjoy. I find that when I just ""switch on"" something like a flowermate or pax, it doesn't give me the vibe as much somehow. Like it's just on and I inhale freely. It feels like there needs to be some action there, like lighting a lighter to a bowl. Pressing the battery and shaking works like that for me. It's a routine that you can get into, like you're keeping things running smoothly yourself and other, more automatic vapes somehow miss that."
mflb,38f0u4,Ressotami,2,Wed Jun 3 20:07:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the well thought response, very good points indeed, and it touches on some of the things I've really enjoyed about using my mflb.  Obviously I have no reason to ever stop using it, but I guess my question now is do I pay close to the price of my original purchase for a power adapter to make it a more reliable staple of my smoking tools?"
mflb,38f0u4,Ressotami,2,Wed Jun 3 20:15:01 2015 UTC,"For me, personally, It's more than worth it.  It took me off the grid so to speak. Before I didn't realise how dependent I was on charging and batteries. Constantly cycling and swapping them out.   When I got the PA I could just sit and sesh with it for a whole evening, Start a trench off on super low, just cook it a little and release the flavour. Then move onto medium and tumble a lot to evenly brown it. Finally you can shake vigorously and pulse the button on max temperature to really get it dark brown and release some really potent and thick vape.   You just don't get that with the batteries and it made the LB even more worth it to me. The cost seems insignificant years later and I already claimed one replacement for damage. I know my wires fraying at the base and I know a new improved design will be sent to me when it does. It will have a new metal jacket to stop exactly that fault. You get a lifetime supply of the product including revisions and upgrades."
mflb,38f0u4,thissayssomething,3,Wed Jun 3 20:20:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like they really don't compare because it's dry herbs vs concentrates. If you can get concentrates regularly and want convenience over all, the pen is for you. As a concentrates box, even the muad-dib doesn't really compare. A pen will always be more convenient.   Personally, yea modern pens work awesome, but even when I'm stoned off my ass from them, I feel like I'm missing part of the experience. That could just be me though.   Conservation-wise, it's probably best to try to stay away from concentrates for the most part. Very easy for your tolerance to skyrocket once you get on concentrates, as you probably know."

Its also nice because it lets you keep your batteries charging for when you're on the go. But most of the time, I'm in a place I can use the Power Adapter.  The finishing grinder was actually a bigger game changer for me - as the grind is just completely different than anything else you'll get. I know it wasn't your question, but its a must have accessory in my book."

mflb,388prs,Vladie,4,Tue Jun 2 18:19:24 2015 UTC,The PA has been essential for me. One thing I sometimes get stung by is (could just be mine) that the adjusting wheel is pretty loose and can easily be changed without you realising. I've combusted a couple of times because I accidentally put it up to 100%. Now I put a bit of tape over it to stop it doing that as I never change the setting anyway (I have it just over the 50% dot).

mflb,385jf4,ThisWord,6,Tue Jun 2 22:35:25 2015 UTC,For me it doesn't really matter how fine my herb is ground up because I simply take 1~2 hits of the decently ground up bud to dry it out and then take it out and use my fingers to turn it into dust and voila you have a perfectly ground up trench.

mflb,385jf4,hismikeness,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:38:14 2015 UTC,"I have a coffee grinder aswell that I used to use and still use to grind AVB finer for edibles, I'd say that the consistency is damn hard to tell between the 2 but for a coffee grinder you need more bud to get a finer grind and you lose a good bit of keef in the process (in my experience with my coffee grinder) . This isn't the ""end all""  finishing grinder because if it's out there it doesn't exist yet but it works for people that don't want to grind larger amounts of herb at once,  I usually buy  a quarter at a time and don't break it down till I'm ready to vape it to keep it fresh and a full load in the FG is good for a large bowl/trough in my MFLB,  bong bowl, or EQ. I'd say that one of its highest quality is its portability, consistency, easy to clean, no electricity needed to get a close to powder consistency."

mflb,384qbc,miguel7395,6,Mon Jun 1 21:04:21 2015 UTC,perhaps it's a simple tip but take it slow at first. Even though I have never had any combustion problems with the battery's I combusted a few times with the PA. Start at a percentage around 35% and work your way up while finding what works best for you.
mflb,384qbc,pyromaniacc,3,Mon Jun 1 21:57:59 2015 UTC,My PA also arrived yesterday.  As stated I would use it around 30-60% for the meantime if I were you. That thing has some serious power.   On a 90% used up trench I whacked it to 100% to see what it was like and it pretty much instantly combusted my herb within seconds.. Be careful with 100%!

mflb,3834wk,Ressotami,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"Are you using a Power adapter?   If you are NOT then the problem surely lies with your batteries, not with your box.   Replace the batteries with new glyphs to restore functionality.  If you ARE using the power adapter then first check to make sure that yours hasn't gone faulty. A very common problem with early generation PA 2.0s was a faulty transformer delivering little or no power to the box or a 'pulsed power' which resulted in your launch box light flashing.   Both of these will give the symptoms you describe.  The box itself has very little to go wrong with it at all. The problem usually lies in the power coming in and not the box itself.  Weak power means little or no vapor. But the laws of physics state that if you have good power coming in, then an undamaged launch box trench WILL get hot enough to generate vapor. You really can't escape that fact.   And Magic Flight know this and will probably say what I have said. Unless your box has sustained physical damage to the trench, it will get hot enough with a decent power source. I suspect the reason you have not recieved an instant reply is that your warranty claim is not a ""usually valid"" claim and will have been transferred to a stack of claims that require more attention or further communication with the user.  So I believe it's time to talk about your power/batteries. When did you last replace them?"
mflb,3834wk,I_Submit_This,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:31:13 2015 UTC,"I use a PA when I'm at home, and batteries on the go.  I bought new batteries about a month ago.   Batteries and PA were playing nice with the LB about a month ago (I started to notice the lack of vapour in the last few weeks). Also, last week I used my PA with a friend's LB with no problems. So I am fairly sure that they're in working order.  I think maybe the underside of the trench is clogged, as I just shone a torch through the top of trench and barely any light could get though."

Yeah, it's always smart to test out a g here and there but your a big dude. I've been your size and any time I eat my avb it has to be at least 1.5 to 2 gs to be a decent high.

Box is supposed to make 36 so you can imagine the size of these things. They get me good everytime. Before that I would put about 1g finely ground onto a toasted pb+j. Edibles tend to effect everyone differently. The prior edibles did you make them? I know prior to making my own I didnt think edibles did much but now I have no problem with 1g of some lightly vaped avb when i make it myself. Maybe its the quality of the herb im using or the process who knows."

I thought I had a medium tolerance, I ate a teaspoon and a half and was absurdly, helplessly high well into the next day. Sometimes it only kicks in when you eat a reasonably sized meal. Sometimes it can take a long time (3+ hours) to kick in fully."

Although I feel that smoking the 3.5 will be so much more beneficial to you high-wise. From experience I say it takes about 2x as much AVB to get the same level of high if you smoked green - eating it isn't as economical. Doesn't taste mint but it's not bad at all, i sometimes prefer smoking AVB as it gives me more of a sleepy high."

mflb,380vra,MixBleachAndAcetone,3,Mon Jun 1 01:07:11 2015 UTC,"What I do is to put it on a flat piece of card (as OP has done) then take a playing card or a business card or something and drag it gently over it, separating the larger bits from the smaller bits. Once I have the larger bits, I crumble them up a little and re-vape. They're the bits which settle on the top of the trench so they don't get as much heat, plus when it gets properly cooked it winds up more dusty anyway, so you're separating out that dusty cooked weed.  Then I re-vape the big bits which I've crushed up. Rinse and repeat for weeks until you're basically just loading ashen powder into the trench every time."

mflb,37ykdt,HanukkahMonster,10,Mon Jun 1 00:09:59 2015 UTC,So why did you roommate give you box to the police?
mflb,37ykdt,mflbninja,29,Sun May 31 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"It's a weird story, but what the hell I'll quickly run through it, I'd be curious too. I wanted to move out because he was selling amphetamines out of the house without telling me. As in strangers coming to the house to buy speed, which spooked me when I was just playing Wii in the living room and saw a deal take place right in front of me. I told him that I wanted to move out but he forbid it. He called the real estate agent to say I was threatening to not pay rent, but the agent said of course I could move out. That made him furious so he changed the locks to our house, locking me out, and told me I'd need to give him $1000 if I wanted my belongings back. Of course I went to the police to get them to open the door for me but he told me if I tried to use the police to get my belongings back that he'd give the police my weed and vape (he searched literally every one of my belongings in my room while I was locked out). I wasn't deterred so the police got him to open the door and he insisted on leading an officer into my room. What was waiting for me in my bedroom in plain view, of course my weed and MFLB, as well as some sex toys that he found and had laid out to humiliate me. The police confiscated it and fined me.  In his rage he delivered these threats to me through text message. Apparently extortion and blackmail are illegal too and the police were interested to hear about it all, so he's got his own regrets about what he's done (cold comfort for me though).  It was probably the most stressful and violating day of my life. I don't talk to people about my sex life, no one in my life even knows I own sex toys so seeing them laid out in my room after he insisted in leading me and an officer into my room was pretty intense. He looked very pleased with himself when he did it, like he was walking on air. I can't even begin to describe how furious I am over all of it, haha.   tldr; my ex-roommate is apparently capable of being pretty sadistic. Giving the police my weed and MFLB was a blackmail attempt by him that he followed through on :/"
mflb,37ykdt,havoktheorem,15,Sun May 31 15:54:42 2015 UTC,That dude will make a fantastic prison bitch. Did you tell the cops about the amphetamines?
mflb,37ykdt,mflbninja,8,Sun May 31 16:23:40 2015 UTC,"He'd have a good time in prison, I'm sure of it. And I did not. He got his partner reluctantly involved in his deals too.

mflb,3813y6,DreadsMcGee,2,Mon Jun 1 02:25:37 2015 UTC,Ive ran through 2 sets on Powerexs now in less than 8 months and I can for certain say Glyphs are better for home use. I do However love the amount of powerexs I had. 4 kept me nice and toasty all day with 0 worry. I saw that sometimes with only 2 glyphs I would have an overlap of dead battery time which can easily be remedied by getting another set of glyphs. Sorry for the ramble. I vote glyphs.
mflb,37zhva,Chazzet,2,Sun May 31 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"No one answered your question it seems, but the MFLB requires a minimum of 2000mah to operate, so no, those won't work.  Glyph's are the best option and I'm pretty sure the Magic Flight store ships everywhere."

They will usually get you 2 full trenches pretty easily. I have 4 glyphs and I hardly ever need even a third.
mflb,37zhva,MouthyMike,0,Sun May 31 18:54:26 2015 UTC,The issue is that me and my friend are buying the mflb as a joint investment and that will mean that when we use it we'll only have one battery each.
mflb,37zhva,MouthyMike,-4,Sun May 31 19:06:20 2015 UTC,You made no mention of any extenuating circumstances in your post.  You should provide enough details for someone to properly respond. I suggest buying an extra pair of Glyphs since you made the investment you did.

mflb,37uwjv,spupul6,3,Sat May 30 16:31:10 2015 UTC,Problem could be with the batteries. I would highly recommend the PA adapter for more consistent and higher power. I never even use the batteries anymore.
mflb,37uwjv,Schliere,1 point,Sat May 30 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I always wanted one, but it has a relatively high price and now I cant afford it. But I plan  to connect 4 batteries with parrelel configuration so the capacity will be the 4x amount while the voltage stays the same"
mflb,37uwjv,sadmanwithabox,3,Sat May 30 17:43:54 2015 UTC,"Even with the higher mah from putting the batteries in parallel, since the voltage remains the same, I don't see how this would help your issue. It would give you more consistent hits, but I don't think it would make your box get any hotter."
mflb,37uwjv,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Sat May 30 21:56:47 2015 UTC,Wiring the cells in parallel means you parallel the ESR as well. Usually the ESR is around 0.1Ω (giving you 15A at 1.5V) while four cells in parallel could provide almost 60A (1.5V /[0.1Ω/4])!
mflb,37uwjv,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Sun May 31 09:03:15 2015 UTC,"Rechargeable AA ""batteries"" are only 1,2 volts! So that would lead to 48A. If thats too much, is it possible to use potentiometer(I know it decreses the Voltage) or put an other little resistance series to cut off the Current?"
mflb,37uwjv,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Sun May 31 11:56:52 2015 UTC,"If im not calculating it wrong an 0,05 Ohm resistance at 1,2 V will give 16A(with 4 cells). are there variable resistances on the market?"
mflb,37uwjv,I_Submit_This,1 point,Sun May 31 12:19:55 2015 UTC,To calculate parallel resistance we use the following formula:      1/R.tot = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn   since n = 4 and all the resistances are the same (R =0.1Ω) we can write:      1/R.tot = 4/R => R.tot = R/4 = 0.1Ω/4 = 0.025Ω      1.2V / 0.025Ω = 48A   The internal resistance is given by the chemistry of the cell and varies quite a bit with current draw and temperature as well as charge level (low when fully charged). There is no way of selecting the ESR like you can a regular resistor value.
mflb,37uwjv,beerandabike,1 point,Sun May 31 12:36:30 2015 UTC,"even ~50A is a lot of current when 10-15A are usually flowing. You could use a series resistor (a bunch of them in parallel would be even better) as long as it is rated for the power you plan to use. It would need to be rated for say 3W for it not to melt or even catch fire! Of course you'll waste a bit of your energy through the resistor, decreasing the usable capacity.  EDIT: Not 30W, but 3W. Sorry!"
mflb,37uwjv,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Sun May 31 12:28:36 2015 UTC,i would not advise that ... but our resident expert /u/AwesomePixelMan can clarify if this is doable.
mflb,37uwjv,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Sat May 30 17:48:48 2015 UTC,why do you think thats not  good idea?
mflb,37uwjv,I_Submit_This,1 point,Sat May 30 21:34:58 2015 UTC,"If you wire it up in parallel (+ of each batter to + lead, - of each battery to - lead) then yes you'll increase your mAh. Do NOT wire it in series (+ of battery one to - of battery two, etc to end in a lead), this WILL ruin your mflb because of overvoltage that the screen won't be able to handle, and series could be harmful to the batteries as well.  With that being said, I can't believe I've never thought of that! Then again I got the PA not too long after buying my mflb. So parallel yes! If you do then definitely post up some how to guide for other's."
mflb,37uwjv,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Sun May 31 08:56:48 2015 UTC,"A series battery (at say 6V) would not damage the screen since the max. current would be the same! You have four times the ESR but four times the voltage as well, making it output the same amount of current as one cell. You will damage the bulb though, since it runs on a couple of mA which is well below the cells limit!   A parallel config is capable of many dozens of amps, making it more dangerous!"
mflb,37uwjv,I_Submit_This,1 point,Sun May 31 09:14:49 2015 UTC,"the potential max. current is four times higher (~50A) potentially generating to much heat.

mflb,37lt0e,moistgnome,3,Thu May 28 19:19:34 2015 UTC,"Hi mate, bit of advice is to get the technique right when inhaling. Holding down the battery for too long and sucking too hard and fast will likely make your bud combust and stinky so... the slower you suck and the less you hold the battery down for should mean less smell. Personally I hold the battery down for 5 seconds to let some vapour build in the chamber, start vaping whilst still holding the battery down for a further 5 seconds, let the battery out and inhale everything (hold it down for 5-15 seconds depending on the weed). So 5 - 5 - 10 is the three stage method I usually go for and there is never a smell. Also to limit smell grind your bud well before you start vaping and/or grind somewhere else so the room doesn't stink anyway.  N.B. - The more charged the battery is... the less time you have to spend holding it down, if your battery is running out of juice you may have to hold it down for longer than 5 seconds each time but you'll get the hang of it.  Edit: I think another factor I never smell anything (nor my partner or brother) who both don't smoke is because 1.) I vape directly next to a wide open window and 2.) I make sure I blow it straight out of the window (don't get seen lol)... Probably helps a bit.  All the best and enjoy!"

You are mostly turning herb over as a unit, not really mixing it up.  With this, it burns way more evenly and with less shaking."
mflb,37k3g4,schmeebasaur,1 point,Thu May 28 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"seems cool, does anything get stuck inside the globe? If so, is it easy to clean out? What does it smell like?  Could you put a cap on it to save a half done trench for later to preserve your box screen? I have sooo many questions, I'm SUPER high right now man."
mflb,37k3g4,Dareeude,2,Thu May 28 08:51:02 2015 UTC,"Nothing gets stuck. It is glass, and additionally the herb has already been dried out at least once so it is pretty low friction.   Yeah it should be super easy to clean out, haven't had to though. Can just wipe inside with paper towel. Doesn't smell much, a little bit of the herb just like everything else in proximity.  Yes you could put a cap, in fact most of the snowglobe kits come with one that is water-tight. Though really, I leave half done trenches in box for days without any problems.   One interesting thing is you could conceivably have multiple globes like this setup, and just hot-swap them in for different strains / herbs."
mflb,37k3g4,stereo440,1 point,Thu May 28 09:02:09 2015 UTC,Definitely a great accessory and could help tremendously with kief-laden trenches. Under normal circumstances I don't think it will have a very big difference on the uniformity of the trench.
mflb,37k3g4,I_Submit_This,1 point,Thu May 28 13:35:30 2015 UTC,This would be perfect along with a green MF laser. It would be like watching a lightshow as the vapor builds. Dope for group sessions. I might just have to make one...

mflb,37ivar,compoundbreak791,3,Wed May 27 23:24:02 2015 UTC,Yes but the taste is more on the repulsive side. If you put the AVB in your mouth and wash it down with something really sweet tasting like orange soda quickly you can manage with minor repercussions...aka gagging

I didn't know whether to be proud or feel bad because he was almost too high. So yes, eat it, but maybe start small or prepare thyself for the couch."
mflb,37ivar,johnnypesos,1 point,Sun May 31 03:37:23 2015 UTC,Let me tell you about my first experience with AVB. A few months ago I wanted to try it and I decided on mixing it with some applesauce. Of course I spilled over 2 grams worth in it. I tried to pick out as much as I could but the damage was done. But I wasn't about to waste it so I threw it back anyways. It was horrible. I could practically chew it and was gagging every bite. I HIGHLY recommend you take it with something else. Like a PB and banana sandwich or something. I feel like you'd have a bad time if you tried it with just a spoonful of PB.

Should give you an idea of what the mflb would be like with it. That or buy some tubing from a hardware store and a stopper with a hole from a homebrewing supply shop. Should be able to put something together for much less than the whip."

mflb,37cstb,Bronnabis,4,Tue May 26 19:04:41 2015 UTC,The water doesn't really do anything to it in my experience.  Ever try cleaning out the stem with just a bit of cold water?
mflb,37cstb,happyself,1 point,Tue May 26 23:27:03 2015 UTC,It definitely gives the oil a strange pattern and foggy texture. I used to do this and stopped for this reason.   Not all of the components of the honey are completely nonpolar.

mflb,37gku6,arilotter,1 point,Wed May 27 15:36:42 2015 UTC,"You'll want to mimic a AA cell with your PA as you mentioned. Most cells can supply around 13A and are limited by their internal resistance since the screen is basically a short. You'll want to stay below 1.5V for normal use and go above for concentrates or to get every last molecule out...   What you need is a buck or step-down converter. If you are good at electronics I suggest going with a discrete solution. You'll need to make your own PCB and solder SMD parts (IC, MOSFETs, and misc parts).   If you like simple solutions go for an off-the-shelve converter like the one I used! They only require a voltage adjust resistor (or potentiometer in our case) and some caps on the input.  Unfortunately I could not measure the high current going through the screen any more precise than +10A... But you don't need to worry about breaking the box. The worst you can do is burn out the bulb by applying a voltage above ~2V, keep in mind that even a few hundred mA will suffice to kill it. To really damage the screen you'd need a lot of current!"

No stem for honey oil, but instead you get it all right away don't have to worry about cleaning it out later. I keep mine angled at a 45 degree angle (toward the floor) this gives me a better contact with the wood (less vapor leakage around the edges) and I feel like a smoother less constricted vapor path than holding it perpendicular to my lips."
mflb,37cvo9,rodneyb74,2,Thu May 28 21:49:37 2015 UTC,"Would a shorter stem still make you cough?  If the box was in a material that could be cleaned more easily I would think about going native more often.  But since it's in wood, it will fast turn in to a stained bacterial herd. I wouldn't want that."
mflb,37cvo9,lomstar,3,Tue May 26 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"I think length makes a slight difference; like the barrel of a gun.

The box can handle extended periods of the battery being used. Use it as an excuse to clean your MFLB.  Just stick it in there for 60 seconds or until it seems too hot to handle, clean your box with a brush, let the battery cool and then repeat a few times. Once it's fully discharged, re-charge it fully. It might help a little bit."

mflb,37bmts,bannable15,2,Tue May 26 23:54:45 2015 UTC,"I like top comment. What he's suggesting is a manual battery refresh, not a bad option.  I've had better experiences with ""smart"" refreshes like this $40 battery charger can do. You said money's tight but if you have $40 this will give you more life out of your batteries. Granted, it's more effective if you do it every 3 months rather than once there's already a problem.  You should be doing an ISO cleaning every 10 sessions or so. Youtube videos on how to do it exist, there's also info in the sidebar.   Pretty sure new batteries are only about $15, so that would be the least effort option. Though I'd still recommend that good battery charger once you can afford it, to keep the batteries lasting longer."
mflb,37bmts,aznsensation8,1 point,Tue May 26 16:56:59 2015 UTC,Get a PA when you can. I got mine a week ago and it is very convenient to own no more swapping out and charging batteries.

mflb,37aow9,oviforconnsmythe,2,Tue May 26 05:52:33 2015 UTC,"i think it might be because when you hit directly from the mflb you are generally taking slow hits and sipping it where as with the third lung you are inhaling a lot quicker, allowing the vapor to spread out more in your lungs."
mflb,37aow9,danketree,1 point,Tue May 26 08:10:56 2015 UTC,"That could be true, but even when hitting directly, I still keep the many sips in my mouth and don't inhale sharply until after the hit. It could even be preconception bias cause everyone on r/mlfb said it was amazing (and it is).   Now I'm thinking that the third lung is better at pulling vapor than  using a stem/whip, or native and is more beneficial for vapor formation.  This could be complete garbage, but I think the pressure difference created using a stem is alot higher than a grocery bag, so the vapor flows faster, cooling the trench more, and producing less vapor (while still heating the trench.) Im sitting here at a solid [6] so i could just as easily be wrong.."
mflb,37aow9,Smokeswaytoomuch,2,Wed May 27 08:45:46 2015 UTC,"I find the opposite, The only way i can get high from my vape is by using a third lung, But one full trench into a 2ltr bottle and im good ;)  Try a bigger bottle, shake it around and cook a whole trench into one and then enjoy."
mflb,3791ls,chezecheetos,33,Mon May 25 21:31:01 2015 UTC,"Better batteries. I like being able to use AA, but I'd like to see a battery system than can rival the PA."
mflb,3791ls,thexn,9,Mon May 25 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"Better yet, (and I doubt this would happen), include a PA with the kit instead of batteries."
mflb,3791ls,oviforconnsmythe,3,Tue May 26 05:43:58 2015 UTC,I think the PA is much more expensive to produce than the box. MF could not ask so much for the box alone if there was a set. Since only experienced pilots really want to spend the extra money nobody would get the pricey set anyway because the PA can be bought separately...
mflb,3791ls,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Tue May 26 20:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if the PA was part of the kit, the price would be significantly higher. Its just hard to see a battery solution that rivals the PA (and is cost effective) as thexn posted."
mflb,3791ls,oviforconnsmythe,2,Wed May 27 08:54:29 2015 UTC,"While that would be awesome, the original purpose is portability and using it on the go. You can't really use a PA while out and about. But it would be neat to have a package deal with the PA"
mflb,3791ls,GoHomeLydia,1 point,Tue May 26 17:28:14 2015 UTC,"Thats definitely true, portability and stealth is a huge selling feature for the MFLB, both of which the PA inhibits. It would be cool to see both kits offered, with the PA obviously costing a little more."
mflb,3791ls,oviforconnsmythe,-4,Wed May 27 08:51:28 2015 UTC,"I just want to remark that most issues with battery life are due to technique. Running the box too cool can waste good energy and lead to piss poor battery life. No matter what your drawing technique is, be it long draw, stacking or sipping, it is necessary to employ a form of temperature detection for every single hit; timing can't do it all.  You can detect the temperature in native mode by simply feeling the vapor as it exits the LB, after it has a chance to expand in your mouth a little; or by using a rig, such as a third lung or bong, that you can see into to measure the thickness of the vapor by eyesight. Regardless of which method you choose, good battery life is all about running the LB at max temperature!"
mflb,3791ls,mflbninja,2,Tue May 26 16:59:12 2015 UTC,"I just want to remark that most issues with battery life are due to technique.   Well, kind of. Battery life is inversely proportional to the amount of cycles and the charge/ discharge current as well as temperature. IMO there is nothing worse for a poor NiMH than to end up in an MFLB ;) You basically short the cell regardless of the technique used, not to mention the high charging temperature... I have read that you can expect between 500-1000 cycles, with 500 being a reasonable estimate for use with the box. Let's say that after two years of vaping you'll need new ones."

I exclusively use that stem even though I have a new, full length one because it stays in the box easier (mine is ~2 years old if that makes any difference), and accumulates honey oil faster. The only downside of the short stem is that it gets a bit hot sometimes when I'm stacking hits with my PA, but that's the only thing I can think of that is a downside of the short stem."

Instead use the plunger method (album courtesy of the legendary /u/I_Submit_This). I could be wrong and MFLB could have changed the material in the stems with the whips at any point.

Maybe they make one that actually fits the contours of one's hands? Not that I'd prefer that, but it may be something that could make it next level. Maybe modular trays so I could pick up my herbal tray, put it to the side, then put a wax tray in. The light could also be in a more convinient location, because my weed always covers the light. I should be able to hit the box and still see if it's powered. All minor suggestions, but that's because the MFLB stands alone as the no BS herbal vape."

It says it lasts forever using nuclear power but I don't know what that means in non-alien. Does it actually use nuclear power or is that a joke?  As far as grip goes, I was thinking something more like this.  For the modular trays, yea the additional concentrate trays are nice and I've heard they're effective, but not as effective as the MD because they're not designed to concentrate that much heat into one little area for the regular MFLB. If two seperate modular trays could get the effectiveness of both the standard box and the MD, that would be revolutionary.  I would like the light to maybe be on the top of the box so that I can make sure the battery is in fact engaged when I'm vaping, not to see how much bud I have left."

The MD is ""specifically"" for concentrates and is such a small tray that it super concentrates the voltage on the really small screen to give you a super fast and hot dab spot, which is why you can get away with using tiny sized dabs. Whereas the Hybrid is just an MFLB with a fancy lid, you can use concentrate trays but because you are still heating such a large screen area ""and"" the concentrate insert trays..

mflb,375jc8,Unfamed15,5,Mon May 25 01:44:34 2015 UTC,"No harm done. Anything can touch the inside of the launch box trench. The reason you are warned about it is that the trench is fragile and susceptible to stabbing and puncture. But as long as the touch is gentle then there are no problems.   Avoid anything that concentrates pressure on a small section of screen (toothpick or screwdriver head) as this will damage the screen more readily.  Your fleshy finger, if applied gently will have no lasting or damaging effect on your box. However it is good rule of thumb to not touch the screen with anything but the supplied brush and then you can be sure that you're not going to accidentally do something that might damage the screen."

Whenever this question gets asked in any of the VAPING forums, you'll always get the 'bro science' replies that 'no combustion= no carcinogenic chemicals and no carbon monoxide, therefore it is healthier than combustion. And to an extent this is true.  However there simply has not been enough research into vaporisers as a whole, and also vapes on an individual model basis, to be able to give a definitive answer to how much vapes can impact your health.  Obviously some people will disagree with me, but here's one example in which vapes may affect health, which is not always considered: VAPING is known to be more efficient than combustion in terms of delivering cannabinoids to the user, and this is because combustion tends to destroy a lot of cannabinoids before they even make it to your lungs. In terms of cannabinoids, this is a WIN for vapourisers.   However what happens to residual pesticides/ herbicides/ nutrient salts that are also found in ones herbs of choice. Does the same apply: do more of these chemicals make it intact into your lungs when vaping than combusting? Obviously I don't have the answer to this question, but the point I'm trying to make is that a lot of people will instantly assume that vaping is 'healthier' than combustion, and while this is true in some respects, we most definitely do not have a full understanding of the exact health impacts that vapes do carry.

They only tested for high mass gas (not low mass gas), but it gives us a good idea.  In short, vaporizing produces much less non-cannabinoid/toxic chemicals but the cannabinoids are in high amount (since they vaporize at ""low"" temperature below combustion).  So the MFLB is much more healthy that smoking; you avoid, for the most part, inhaling 100s of chemicals found in smoke."

Vaping too much without a watertool definitly irrtates my throat and vaping in gernal causes phlegm.   Also Cannabis has side effects, dehydration for example so always drink while vaping"

However, in an mflb, the weed isn't being burnt, it's just being conducted. You're still breathing things into your lungs so it's not per se ""healthy"", but then again, going outside is dangerous too."

First with a medium sandpaper, and then with a fine sandpaper. Be sure to wear a glove, just in case the stem breaks in your hand as you are sanding.

mflb,36v057,madmario123,3,Fri May 22 10:03:25 2015 UTC,"I use very small amounts of oil, and I haven't cleaned it once. I only use oil occasionally though. You'd be surprised how many good hits you can get without oil, so keep on using it. IME it doesn't smell much to use, but I've heard using a butane torch is really smelly.  I use batteries, and a 1.5' length of 1/4"" vinyl tubing I got from home depot. A PA would be ideal but batteries work the best for me. It takes a while to get it properly, but once you get it going you can get a bunch of good hits. Also, make sure you use the right tray for the right material (check the instruction manual that comes with it (both trays come in the pack)).  I dont know if a stem will work or not, but I can't see it being that bad.  I usually put very little oil (maybe the size of a round sprinkle). Make sure you're using fresh batteries first of all, thats key.   **1) Put the tray with the oil in the box.   2)Hold the battery in for a good 10-20 seconds with the screen closed. Make sure its a clean screen (use isopropanol to clean if necessary).   3) Look carefully at the tray, the oil will melt down and should absorb into the tray (might be different for hash) you might see small wisps of vapor forming.   4)While still looking at the tray closely, after oil is a liquid and is sizzling, start drawing very very very weakly, like as if your barely sipping from a straw.   5) If the tray is ready,  and hot enough, you should see a very subtle change in the inside of the box. You should be able to barely see the vapor being pulled out of the trench.  Keep holding the battery in.   6) Continue taking extremely weak draws, in pulses, to allow the vapor to replenish. After it gets hot enough, you shouldn't have to wait between draws for the vapor to reform. It'll eventually happen  immediately as long as the battery is held in.   7) If you have a smokebuddy you should still use it with the oil, as it can still smell a bit.   8) Keep in mind that my box turned 2 years old yesterday, and the ends of the trench are starting to tear. You may not need to keep the batteries in continuously** after its gets hot enough  Tl;dr: Use fresh batteries, and keep your battery held in continuously, especially if its an old box. Draw very very weakly in pulses, taking break between draws to allow the vapor to reform."

mflb,36v057,MrWeaD,2,Fri May 22 12:50:33 2015 UTC,I usually use my trays on near full to full power on the pa. Even then it takes 4 or 5 seconds to start to smoke. Hash seems to take a little longer to start smoking than oil does. A pa and a whip is highly recommended.
mflb,36v057,randomb0y,0,Fri May 22 17:54:22 2015 UTC,I tried to use the tray but never got any satisfactory results. It vaporizes at a higher temp than bud so without a long path for the vapor to cool it's not very pleasant.

This will limit intake of your herb but will run hotter so you will get less hits, be sure to hold them for a few seconds to get the most from them. Also watch for combustion.  You can also trust in the fact that vapor hits you after about 10-20 minutes and take 2-3 solid pulls on the launch box and put it down. You won't feel much at first but trust in the onset and wait and see if it gets you where you want to be. Remember, you are in control of your own journey. Don't do more than is comfortable for you and take into account the delayed onset of any effects and plan ahead by taking it slow and waiting for each intake to take effect before you decide if you want to go further.  Another technique would be to pulse the batteries by pressing them 1 second on half a second off. Increase the time on and decrease the time off as desired to lightly toast the trench and of course....shake like mad throughout.  I liken it to roasting coffee beans. They need to tumble in a hot oven. If the whole thing didn't rotate then the beans would go black and charred on one side.   Instead they are tumbled in hot air to pull out their true flavour.  That is the essence of a good launch box shake and stack. The herb is almost air roasted."

The act of expanding the space draws air in through the stem to fill it.   The important thing isn't which bottle you use, it's how well it's sealed and how strong it is. Poorly built lungs will leak air, fall apart with clumsy use and lose their effectiveness. You need a quality bag and some duct tape or similar to make a lung that will last multiple sessions.  Having said that, 500ml is small and the preferred size is either 1 or 2L size bottles. They are wider and so you can get a better tape join with the bag. More surface area for the tape to stick to."

mflb,36r4j9,imflb,38,Thu May 21 14:36:08 2015 UTC,LOL. Reading this made our morning. ^ Solid advice we also recommend following. <3
mflb,36r4j9,MagicFlight,9,Thu May 21 16:51:55 2015 UTC,I love that I can look in the comments of some random post and see you guys. Seriously one of the best companies in the world :D
mflb,36r4j9,FearsomeBubble,7,Thu May 21 16:55:06 2015 UTC,So glad you guys have a reddit account. Keep being my favorite company <3
mflb,36r4j9,TheAngryBlueberry,2,Thu May 21 17:24:15 2015 UTC,"Wheyyy direct contact! Can you answer a question for me please? What in your opinion is the best, least irritating way of using the orbiter? Direct inhale to the lungs, or drawing from your mouth into the orbiter, and then inhaling a small amount after? Like a cigarette, if that makes sense?  Also, any personal tastes for adding stuff to the orbiter? Any wisdom to share? You guys are a great company- couldn't be happier with my purchases/ warranty interaction. Rock on."
mflb,36r4j9,KickAssIguana,12,Thu May 21 20:35:46 2015 UTC,Use warm/hot water. It helps add water vapor to the cannabis vapor and is significantly more soothing.
mflb,36r4j9,beerandabike,3,Thu May 21 14:32:41 2015 UTC,"I just heard of this a few months ago. Can't believe it's never crossed my mind, you know warm humid air. It really does work!"
mflb,36r4j9,123-45-6789,2,Thu May 21 16:58:26 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't hot water just increase the heat of the draw? I was under the impression that heat is the main problem, since icy bong hits are much smoother."
mflb,36r4j9,KickAssIguana,1 point,Thu May 21 18:21:08 2015 UTC,Vapor is less hot than smoke. The main issue as you said is the dry nature of vapor. With the hot water this solves the issue.
mflb,36r4j9,123-45-6789,1 point,Thu May 21 19:12:57 2015 UTC,Is vapor drier than smoke? Why is dryness an issue?
mflb,36r4j9,KickAssIguana,3,Thu May 21 20:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, vapor is dryer than smoke, I'm not sure why but my guess is the water that is the byproduct of combustion. I also use hot water in combustion water pipes as well. Dryness is an issue because the vapor dries the little hairs (cilia) in your  in your throat. Just try it with hot water and make the choice yourself."
mflb,36r4j9,bannable15,0,Thu May 21 21:59:13 2015 UTC,"Vapor is not more dry than smoke, combustion removes all moisture. If you put vapor under pressure at the same temp it literally turns back into liquid. Which is how you do industrial scale oils btw.   It's also cooler than smoke.  But smoke or vapor, ""Hot"" water (100F) is still cooler than the vaping point, so it would cool it and humid air would help smoke or vapor. So the suggestion makes sense.   You don't have to take my word on the vapor either, Google it, read the wiki entry, also follow the link to ""aerosols""."
mflb,36r4j9,21TQKIFD48,2,Thu May 21 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"I've filled it with peppermint tea, and I liked it. Not enough to do it often, but it's neat. Other than that, I like to use warm water to humidify the vapor"
mflb,36r4j9,toixic,1 point,Thu May 21 22:05:54 2015 UTC,I find if you add crushed ice to it the vapor comes out less dry peppermint oil may help but I think it would be more of a taste things rather than making the smoke less dry
mflb,36r4j9,thissayssomething,1 point,Thu May 21 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"Adding anything more than water in its various forms will only make your piece gross if you don't clean it promptly and thoroughly. So try it, (and report back,) just be sure to clean it well."
mflb,36t4g1,damagedvectors,5,Thu May 21 22:20:39 2015 UTC,The batteries do get hot while charging. Nothing out of the ordinary!

mflb,36t4g1,imflb,2,Thu May 21 22:52:02 2015 UTC,Will also be warm if you discharge them completely.
mflb,36t4g1,ParsInterarticularis,1 point,Fri May 22 00:22:03 2015 UTC,I usually play hot potato with them when I take them off the charger. Just make sure the two batteries are capped once you take them off.
mflb,36t4g1,TooLame,1 point,Fri May 22 03:08:55 2015 UTC,capped? Are the capps that important? Tbh I never used them since I got it.
mflb,36t4g1,congo123869,1 point,Fri May 22 03:37:05 2015 UTC,"Yes they are. Not having the wrapper around the outside of the battery makes the whole outside a negative(I think) terminal. Coins or keys will short out the battery. This can damage the battery and gets pretty hot, hot enough to burn you."
mflb,36t4g1,onefinedjentleman,1 point,Fri May 22 03:49:56 2015 UTC,Well for me this has never happened. IT never gets hot when it sits there. They are sitting with no caps right now and are not hot.  Though it could explain why after 6 months the batteries are not good anymore.
mflb,36t4g1,ExPwN,1 point,Fri May 22 03:53:39 2015 UTC,"They aren't going to get hot just sitting there, that is just silly. The point of the caps is so that when you store them, they do not bridge on something conductive in your backpack/purse/pocket. If there is contact, the battery and whatever it is contacting are going to get hot enough to burn your skin very quickly. Not only that, but there are going to be sparks coming off of the areas in contact. Sparks cause fires. Fires cause... you get the idea. I would personally say it is foolish to store batteries without the caps unless they are in an upright position."
mflb,36t4g1,AwesomePixelMan,1 point,Fri May 22 05:34:47 2015 UTC,"He already explained it, but yeah while travelling the caps are extremely important. Also... the batteries will go bad after about 6 months of daily usage, this is explained on the MFLB website. Buy some more, they're 9.99"
mflb,36qyxy,vapemflbkief,4,Thu May 21 12:46:01 2015 UTC,"The amount of hits you should take depends on if you're using the PA or regular batteries. I use the batteries so when I pack a Kief bowl I usually get 4-5 hits before it starts to taste burnt. In order to make it last as long as possible, after every hit move the Kief around. The end of the brush is a perfect tool for that! Hope that helps and have a nice flight."
mflb,36qyxy,Cisco-Disco,4,Thu May 21 13:16:59 2015 UTC,"Put a small layer of herb first, at the bottom of the trench, then put the kief on top.  You can put as much kief as you want.  The kief will melt on your herb and it will make the trench last like it seems forever."
mflb,36qyxy,WoodyWeedpecker,2,Thu May 21 15:50:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is the method I use as well, you'll get little balls of kief/bud once you shake it."
mflb,36qyxy,AdtheMad,1 point,Thu May 21 19:25:46 2015 UTC,Maybe that's the reason why some herbs last much more than others in the mflb (a lot of kief strains vs almost non kief strains)
mflb,36qyxy,OrlandoCaballoPajero,1 point,Fri May 22 14:31:07 2015 UTC,"I usually dust it and mix it in, vaping lightly so the keif doesn't stick too much and burn."
mflb,36qyxy,thesturg,1 point,Thu May 21 17:20:24 2015 UTC,For pure kief hits spread a thin layer on the bottom of the trench. Less is more! You'll find that only the middle gets hot enough to really vape the kief. Take small hits as especially the first one can make you cough like you never have before. After up to six hits (the taste changes dramatically after that) you brush out the remains and refill... None of it will stick to the trench unless you use to much. IMO two or three trenches will get you where you want to be.
mflb,36qyxy,AwesomePixelMan,0,Thu May 21 19:40:11 2015 UTC,"I found it to be very sticky when you vape it so be sure to gently move the kief about using the brush or your fingers. Try not to vape too long but long enough to get a decent build up of vapour. If you're worried about effing up badly, you can always through in a bit of plant matter or some AVB. Good luck and enjoy. No I mean really, enjoy. I know I do."
mflb,36qyxy,I_Vape,1 point,Thu May 21 15:47:25 2015 UTC,Same for me about the stickiness. It's almost like it turns into a caramel.

mflb,36nwoy,HolloW7,2,Wed May 20 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"My new PA didn't have the white dots, added my own. But the one in this picture might be newer than mine because my cord casing is black while his looks silver."
mflb,36nwoy,Kensei22,2,Thu May 21 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"So this is kind of interesting, my new PA has a black collar on the banana plug instead of your silver one. Is it metal or plastic?"
mflb,36nwoy,standish_,2,Thu May 21 16:39:33 2015 UTC,The metal part was a recent update to the pa2.0 Magic flight changed it to metal because some users were having issues with the older plastic ones fraying or ripping.
mflb,36nwoy,Coaster_Zombie,1 point,Wed May 20 19:59:10 2015 UTC,Its metal.
mflb,36nwoy,standish_,1 point,Wed May 20 20:56:05 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure mine is plastic. It's also a warranty claim but I was under the impression that didn't change the quality of product you'd get.
mflb,36nwoy,I_Submit_This,3,Wed May 20 20:10:01 2015 UTC,"it depends on when you warrantied. if before the upgrade, obviously you would not get the upgrade, but if you warranteed during the upgrade, while they still had stock-on-hand of the version you paid for, you got the version you paid for.    now this stock of PAv1s is gone and any warranties of PAV1s that malfunction are replaced with PAv2s."
mflb,36nwoy,Ressotami,1 point,Wed May 20 20:16:46 2015 UTC,Speaking of versions. ... Are we calling this new one PA 2.1 to distinguish the metal collar and recessed power dial?

mflb,36qa6q,Jtown984,2,Thu May 21 07:29:19 2015 UTC,ABV is actually more common and can be used for anything. If you go to Magic-Flight's site you can also find that they sell an ABV container.

mflb,36q9e3,Ressotami,1 point,Thu May 21 12:42:58 2015 UTC,"Hi!  My herbs are pretty dry. I bought an 1/8 that's lasted me about 2 months (and counting!).  Imgur Imgur  Above are pictures of my grinder and mflb after several uses. It looks like I could still get a few more hits out of this, but it already tastes like ash. Normally I grind it once, but this time it went through twice.  I hold down the battery and count to 5 in my head and look for vapor. I continue holding down and take a hit when whichever happens first. I inhale for 5-10 seconds, at what I think is a medium pace. I let go of the battery and exhale. I shake the mlfb after each hit, making sure to completely empty the trench, then shake it around to get it all back in. Recently I’ve been using it native style.  Let me know if you need any other details! Thanks so much for your help!"
mflb,36q9e3,Beremat,2,Fri May 22 06:08:52 2015 UTC,"That's quite a coarse grind. You are likely getting charring early on at the edges of your buds which gives the slightly burned taste.  Try grinding finer. You can achieve this by drying your herb to a bone dry consistency by leaving it on a cable or tv box (they are warm) for an evening.   The bone dry herb can be crushed into a powder with ease. Then all you have to do is regularly shake your trench as you engage the battery. Get used to always having the trench on the move. The moment it lays to rest is the moment you get hotspots, burning and a bad taste. Keep it all shifting as the battery is engaged and only have it still while you hit on the stem. (obviously or you would hurt your teeth).  I hope this tumbling method gets a better quality of flavour for you along with a finer grind. (I cannot overestimate the importance of a finer grind in your case)"
mflb,36q9e3,CysticMonk3y,1 point,Fri May 22 22:00:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, glad to know I wasn't grinding fine enough. I just ground the shit out of a new bowl! It definitely tastes different and better. There's still an undertone of burn, but at this point I think that might be remnants stuck in my mflb...  I'm not exactly sure how to keep my trench moving as I use it, but I'll look it up."
mflb,36q9e3,beerandabike,1 point,Sat May 23 03:50:58 2015 UTC,"The most surefire way is to just shake the shit out of your launch box after your hits. You can't really damage it from shaking, so don't worry about shaking too hard."
mflb,36q9e3,Bathingintacos,1 point,Sat May 23 08:49:17 2015 UTC,FINISHING GRINDER! And there is still a lot left in that trench...
mflb,36q9e3,MegasOros,2,Fri May 22 07:33:33 2015 UTC,"It's probably a mix between being the type of strain and how much moisture is in your herb.  The flavor comes from the terpenes and if I remember correctly they have an even lower boiling point than thc, so these will vape off much quicker than your trench has psychoactive life. So as you've noticed the flavor goes from herby to popcorny within a few puffs.  I've also noticed that the more moist (to a point!) your herb is the longer the flavor and usability of your trench lasts. I'm thinking because you're getting more water in your vapor and takes longer to vape your trench done.  All in all, it depends on what you're vaping for. Some go for the high, some for the abv, and some for the flavor. Depending on which you're going for, or a compromise for a combination of, is when YOU consider a trench done. If you vape for the flavor, then your trench is done in 1-2 puffs. But! If you do that then you'll have some really good/potent abv, so save that stuff up!"

mflb,36jci1,erttt,1 point,Wed May 20 08:07:00 2015 UTC,"There's so many ways to build your own technique, but one I like that I read on this sub, is breathing thru your nose. It creates a vacuum and pulls the vapor into your mouth. Good for people just learning to take those slow pulls, but also great for anyone that wants a nice rip. I also made a bubbler out of a 30ml clean e juice bottle and two pieces of food grade hose. Works excellent!"
mflb,36jci1,erttt,1 point,Wed May 20 13:00:56 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I should try that out actually! Breathing through your nose always scared me a little because of it's counter-intuition when you put your mouth on the box, but I think your reasoning is sound. Thanks a lot! Oooh, dude, I'd like for you to show me if you have a tutorial around, or if you have any instructions. That sounds like the most legit portable bubbler I've ever heard. I have the Orbiter + UFO, and would love to test your guy out to see how it compares."
mflb,36jci1,anon99161,1 point,Fri May 22 18:43:08 2015 UTC,I'm currently looking for it so I can take some pics. It's nothing fancy at all I just like diy. It's nice tho because a 30ml bottle is pretty small so you really only put in maybe 10ml of water. It's perfect imo because you aren't producing massive vapor out of the mflb. Just enough water to cool things down and get a smooth hit.   And also the breathing thru the nose trick works great! Credit to whoever posted that in this sub

Eventually I could hold my breathe after 6 puffs, and started stacking more and more. Good stuff, solid fundamentals for perfect trenches.  Keep developing this dude, I'm super excited to see you develop your technique! I posted my own little topic too about my technique if you want to give it a read.  It's nearly the same as your own, but I have little tips like drinking water while you hold your breathe, or take your hit with water in your mouth to make it into a bubbler, fun things like that.

This will aid you in not burning your bud.   To get a good hit I will engage the battery (power adapter now life is so much betttttter!) for a few seconds until I see vapor forming, then I inhale gently for a few seconds and then release the battery and keep inhaling.   Lastly, be patient. It most likely won't work well for you straight off the bat. You gotta figure out the finer points of using it. Give yourself time and practice and then you'll be set!

mflb,36i5rw,TravisNoob,12,Tue May 19 15:50:32 2015 UTC,GET A MINI GRINDER. the MFLB is somewhat expensive so most head shops will do a deal with you when you're already spending over $100+ so see if you can get the mini MBLF grinder for free or at a discount. That thing is so helpful when vaping.  Read the manual. Lots of great information presented well Don't over charge batteries and don't lose those little rubber things on the end of batteries

mflb,36i5rw,I_Submit_This,5,Tue May 19 18:36:23 2015 UTC,"I have a wikiepedia page with sources below, i'll add the relevant extract. I may have interpreted the piece incorrectly, let me know and I will edit/delete my comment.   NiMH cells historically had a somewhat higher self-discharge rate (equivalent to internal leakage) than NiCd cells. The self-discharge rate varies greatly with temperature, where lower storage temperature leads to slower discharge rate and longer battery life. The self-discharge is 5–20% on the first day and stabilizes around 0.5–4% per day at room temperature.[22][23][24][25][26] But at 45 °C it is approximately 3 times as high.[15]This is not a problem in the short term but makes them unsuitable for many light-duty uses, such as clocks, remote controls, or safety devices, where the battery would normally be expected to last many months or years. The highest capacity cells on the market (>8000 mA·h) are reported to have the highest self-discharge rates   I thought this meant that with a connection being made either end of the battery, the rate of self discharge is increased. Reducing the overall capacity of the battery - ""causing energy to leak out"".   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93metal_hydride_battery"
mflb,36i5rw,imflb,6,Tue May 19 19:39:27 2015 UTC,"that's the self-discharge rate. this occurs when they are in inactive storage, not in a plugged-in and monitoring, smart charger.    in a plugged-in smart charger, NiMH batts can remain almost indefinitely. but do not store them in an un-plugged charger. the charger's monitoring circuit will monitor those batts to death."

I prefer to use it over the wooden brush which is too stiff when given the choice.   The metal brush is still much stiffer than a painting brush so there's enough ""abrasive"" power in it.  Enough to move the herb around.  But it seems you don't have to be so careful with it since the bristles are not so hard on the screen."

Although I didn't see if it was exactly the same.  If you can get your hand on it, you will see the hairs on the metal brush are less stiff than the current wooden brush and it's easier to clean your box rapidly with it.  If people find themselves in a department store at one time, you can check it out.  I suggest getting the brush if it's indeed similar to mine.    Ironically, I have another vaporizer which I prefer using the wooden MFLB brush for its screen due to the higher ""abrasive"" power of the wooden brush.  I don't have to be careful with it in fear of breaking the screen like I was with the MFLB."
mflb,36h0vu,nogitsunes,3,Tue May 19 09:32:00 2015 UTC,A fine grind helps you get all the active ingredients out efficiently. But you can still use a courser grind if you vape a little more. The colour will be less even though.  Your grind looks really good and will have good results in the box.
mflb,36h0vu,Ressotami,3,Tue May 19 19:44:21 2015 UTC,"a super-fine grind isn't absolutely necessary. this is my grind consistency and technique: not my video    i vape for the ABV, and dose with it medicinally. a more coarse grind allows more cannabinoids to be left in and on the plant matter, while still allowing full decarboxylation. cannabis is fully decarbed when dried to the point that it powderizes when pinched, regardless of color.    you can vape until black and it will still have cannaboids available. only when combusted and it's all turned to ash, are all benefits of ABV gone, but obviously, the lighter it is ... the more potent. check for dryness, then continue to vape by flavor. as it gets more and more ""popcorny"" more and more cannabinoids are removed/vaporized, up until it tastes like burnt popcorn ... that's when you must be watchful of combustion. but even a momentarily combusted trench is still chock-full of goodness and shouldn't be tossed. a little ash isn't going to kill you. surely you've inadvertently swallowed a few scooby snacks. ~¦^)    PΔX"

mflb,36h0vu,WoodyWeedpecker,1 point,Tue May 19 10:36:44 2015 UTC,It's hard to see with images because the proportion are different but I think it looks like a fine grind.

mflb,36gjjb,InternetENT,2,Tue May 19 05:33:39 2015 UTC,"The PA makes it easier to draw for someone new to it, but you still need to provide a explanation.  There's still a learning curve.  I almost never combust with my PA but I keep it on the low side.  Almost in the middle between the first dot and the second dot.  If the first dot is zero and the second 50% then I put it between 30-40% depending.  At 50% is also low enough.  That way I almost never combust.  At that position you can still get your ABV very dark at the end if you want too, so it's powerfull enough.  It just takes a tad longer to produce vapor and slow down the ""reaction"" time needed to draw.  In the sense, that even if you push the PA button 3 second longer at 40%, you won't combust or anything.  So maybe try to use lower power on the PA to introduce new people to the MFLB.  It simplifies the need for perfect timing a bit by extending the ""vaping windows"" imo.  That way even if people wait ""too much"" to see vapor in the window or hole, they still wont combust."
mflb,36gjjb,WoodyWeedpecker,1 point,Tue May 19 12:59:26 2015 UTC,"I find that I combust more with a PA. I also put the power about 75%. Unless it isn't my roommate who has patience in the mflb process, I usually take out pieces and bongs. Its a lot easier and faster."

mflb,36claf,KennyOfBlok,2,Mon May 18 23:03:12 2015 UTC,I like the feel of smooth wood on my lips and you feel the vapor warmer on your tongue. It has no time to cool and condense in the stem (which is why the stem gets filled with honey oil) so you get warmer more full feeling hits
mflb,36claf,dudematt0412,1 point,Mon May 18 23:25:57 2015 UTC,It's easier to regulate temp for me native
mflb,36claf,darkdrgon2136,1 point,Mon May 18 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"I lost my stem about a year ago and never bought a new one. I've noticed that native mode is more stealthy and potent. It's probably more potent because you're getting 100% of the vapor in your mouth/lungs instead of losing a bit with the stem. The only thing I don't like is that it's harsher and more difficult to avoid, whereas with the stem you can control it more with your tongue."
mflb,36claf,LikelyEatingTacoBell,1 point,Tue May 19 05:50:10 2015 UTC,Kind of a draw technique but I put my PA adapter at 25% and take a long slow draw about as powerful as a I normally breath when I see vapor form on the lid (5-8 seconds) so I draw probably 25-35 seconds while holding the bottom down the entire time. I do that for probably a good 75% of the trench then I turn the power to 50% and take 3-5 sips.
mflb,36claf,Pigsin5pace,1 point,Mon May 18 14:10:53 2015 UTC,"I've been looking for tons of techniques as well to build off of my own.  My personal technique involves drinking cold water for the MFLB, and ice in your mouth for the Maud-Dib.  What I've found with my experience are emerging mechanics behind breathing and temperature of the MFLB that can be applied to any technique to improve it. I deducted these ideas from personal experience. I also learned from practical knowledge of heat energy, air flow, vapor extraction.  Lots of playing around. I'll post what I know soon.

mflb,36doid,torof,2,Mon May 18 16:41:10 2015 UTC,"Whichever grinder will make your material finer is the one you want to use. Try holding the grinder upside-down next time! You're encouraged to shake up the herb while it's in the trench, the Magic Flight Guide booklet has the technique shown in a diagram. You don't want to use any utensils or pack down the trench at all. If your herb is dry you can use your fingers to dust down the herb and add a little layer of kief, just shake your box more often if you do so. You're supposed to shake and flip your box after every draw unless you're using the sipping technique."

If you post your technique we might be  to identify something wrong you can correct.  Either way holding in the battery for 5 seconds, taking a slow consistent drag with the battery still engaged for another 5 seconds, then remove the battery while still continuing your draw for 5 more seconds will get you decent vapor. If the batteries are more than 6 months old you might want to get new ones as they do wear out after a while.  You also want to make sure your herb is ground very fine, and that you aren't putting too much in at a time. Try it again with half a trench and see if it does better."

I hold the battery down for 3 seconds, breath in for three (still holding the battery), breath in fresh air for 3 seconds and repeat the process for a total of 3 times.

If instead you're asking if there's any practical use for your previously-warranteed boxes that have their screens ripped out, there actually is one really useful thing you can do with them:  buy a set of Maud-Dib replacement screens and snap one into your warranteed MFLB unit to instantly turn it into a Maud-Dib for use with concentrates.

The ""Glyphs"" are technically closer to 2400 mAH in capacity but are actually much better suited for use in the MFLB.    If you get 2700s, get the charger designed specifically for them.  However, I would highly recommend getting a new set of Glyph batteries and the ""official"" MFLB charger instead.  The newest revision of the charger even has a charging port on the bottom so you can charge your Glyph batteries in a rather roundabout way via the A/C power adapter normally used for the PA, or alternatively via the car adapter."

mflb,366c4m,oaschbeidl,3,Sun Jun 14 10:45:58 2015 UTC,"Might want to make mention that you want 90% or higher isopropyl alcohol for the cleaning for the most effeciency.  Also, make sure it is unscented iso. I know my walmart sells a 70% alcohol with a peppermint scent. Want to avoid anything with fragrances so that you get a clean evaporation and no residue."
mflb,366c4m,iHateThisJob999,2,Sat May 16 21:17:05 2015 UTC,"Just to add my two cents, the iso doesn't strictly need to be any percentage, as long as there are no ingredients besides isopropyl alcohol and water. Higher percentages are more effective, but lower ones still work well. Just be aware that lower percentages are more likely to contain unwanted ingredients.  Also, heating the trench for ~15 seconds, cutting the power, and immediately swabbing the trench with iso will help with stuck-on solids and black marks. It's true that some marks can be impossible or extremely hard to remove, but I've combusted many times in my box without making any marks I couldn't remove with some TLC.  The most important thing, if you want to keep the trench aesthetically tidy, is to clean it as soon as is convenient after combusting. The more you use your box with gunk in the trench, the harder the gunk is to remove."

It can be purchased from amazon.     please link to a clear pic of an ISO bottle that shows percentages, or an amazon link with a good, non-marketingish description.     Why use ISO to clean your box? (rewrite):     The box will eventually start building up carbon deposits, no matter how well you clean it using the brush. The carbon basically fills in the holes in the screen that you breath the vapour through, a clean box means increased airflow. ISO  dissolves this carbon before it becomes carbonized within the mesh and becomes permanent and impossible-to-remove, by wicking away the carbon, before this happens."

If you are having trouble with my link or just don't want to click here is the relevant text:   My background consists of 30 years as a Research and Development Engineer involved in the development of silicone elastomers and implantable silicone devices. I agree with the manufacturers recommendations for cleaning the silicone cups. Silicone has poor resistance to acids and bases found in sterilizing solutions and hydrogen peroxide. I have personal knowledge of silicone degradation caused by beta dyne solutions commonly used as a micro biocide in surgery. Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) can cause slight temporary swelling of the silicone, but as long as it is allowed to evaporate completely it will not deteriorate silicone. Oil based lubricants can swell/permeate the silicone and may not readily evaporate and can cause a loss in physical properties. My main concern with oil based lubricants would be biocompatibility in such a sensitive tissue environment."

Vaping itself, not the box per se, may cause you irritation while it was fine for you before and it is still fine for other people.  In any case, I suggest you give yourself a couple of weeks without vaping or smoking anything.  Give time for your lungs to heal themselves if there's a problem.  Then try to find the real source of your problem as described above, or other venues (weed strain, etc).  Some vapes like convection vaporizers which may offer smoother vapors for you (as it does to me, but I don't have breathing problem just a lot of coughing).  There's also a draw whip that can be used with the box to reduce the temperature of the vapor as well as an orbiter to filter the vapor with water.  I don't have an orbiter but I have a 1ft draw whip from MF.  It works well to cool down the vapor."

mflb,367jwf,I_Submit_This,2,Sun May 17 02:25:01 2015 UTC,Waking up coughing? Just short of breath? Difficulty exhaling? Those kinds of details. Easier to catch your breath once you sit up?
mflb,367jwf,Beremat,1 point,Sun May 17 02:47:17 2015 UTC,"No, just waking up. I used to sleep the whole night through."
mflb,367jwf,I_Submit_This,2,Sun May 17 05:05:31 2015 UTC,"why are you associating waking up with breathing difficulties? if you're ""just waking up"", this could easily be something unrelated to vaping , possibly not connected to the MFLB, or vaping at all.     I've read that the hot vapour can cause irritation on the lungs, which is what I assume is happening, since it goes away after a few days. But why now? Why after 4 years?     vapor is hot & dry. are you native, or stem, currently? (whip on order).    ... it goes away = your body recuperating.    why 4 years/now = natural, accumulated, wear and tear on your airway from inhaling hot/dry vapor, added on top of normal wear and tear from breathing ""normal"" urban air.    the addition of a secondary collection chamber (wet/bubbler, or dry/3rd lung), will help cool the vapor, and obviously a water device will also moisturize and cool it even more, and if warm/steamy water is used, it can be even more smoothing ... THEN! ... adding a few drops of peppermint oil (or any other of many easy-on-the-throat, essential oils), to that warm water and ... BAM!!! add soothing on top of that."
mflb,367jwf,deadheartsbeat,1 point,Sun May 17 09:29:00 2015 UTC,"The only reason I associate the waking up with vaping is because it doesn't happen when I don't vape. I considered the wear-and-tear-with-time theory and that makes a lot of sense, but I really don't do it that much. I sometimes go months without vaping. When I do, it's like 3 trenches for the whole weekend. Idk, it just feels weird because I've never experienced these problems before. I appreciate all the comments though."
mflb,367jwf,deadheartsbeat,2,Sun May 17 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"Cannabis can reduce the amount of deep sleep you experience, which may make it easier to wake up. This effect combined with the anxiety from your breathing problems might explain the waking up."

You probably already know as its very common - but honey oil is great stuff. Sort of like kief, take a tiny little bit away from your high per sesh for a pretty big reward in comparison.

mflb,364g53,Randyyy30,2,Sat May 16 01:52:40 2015 UTC,Fit an earbud rubber on the end of your stem (where you inhale). Now lightly press that into the downspout of a bong (NOT INSIDE). Just use the rubber to create a seal where your bowl head normally goes.   It helps tremendously to have a PA or to remove the internal battery ring when doing this for bongs.
mflb,364g53,barrelsmasher,2,Sat May 16 05:51:55 2015 UTC,I came to write This! I read this tip on a site maybe a year ago. Turns your bong into a desktop vape. And the hits can me massive! Good call brotha!

mflb,3602dp,AftershockMD,1 point,Fri May 15 12:56:37 2015 UTC,I use a drill bit and break em out. Not when it is in the drill. A little canned air to blow it clean. I leave my stems in though.

mflb,3602dp,generik777,1 point,Fri May 15 07:01:09 2015 UTC,The L or U paperclip works. Make sure you get it out in one piece so no tiny glass pieces stay in. Ended up having to warranty my box cuz of that. Mflb folks are awesome if it comes to that tho.

Wet it (or put it at the bottom of a plastic container with 1/4 inch of water) and sand the broken part of the stem down. The water is really important, you do not want to be breathing in glad dust, and the water traps it."

mflb,3612gl,dailyvaper123,3,Fri May 15 05:04:50 2015 UTC,Why not cut straight to the chase and decarboxylate your bud and eat it?
mflb,3612gl,happyself,2,Fri May 15 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"i like the two different types of highs. properly decarbed greens still have all the THC. With ABV you get the heady, THC high when you vape, and then consuming that low-THC ABV gives more of a body load, however you consume it ... especially when ingested digestively."

mflb,3612gl,happyself,1 point,Fri May 15 18:00:20 2015 UTC,What!1! how do you do this?
mflb,3612gl,happyself,2,Fri May 15 22:53:02 2015 UTC,"Here's a good write up on the process.  TL;DR:  Grind up your bud, put it in the oven @ 230f for 110 minutes, and boom, decarboxylated buds!  At that point you can eat them raw, add them to food (like you've been doing), or if that doesn't taste good, cook them down into butter or oil to make cannabutter/oil - that's the butter or oil with all of the cannabinoids (THC, CBD, etc.) infused in and all of the plant material strained out, leaving you with highly activated butter or oil to cook edibles with."
mflb,3612gl,happyself,1 point,Sat May 16 11:26:10 2015 UTC,"The act of cooking it in to butter removes the need to bake it first.   Only if the temperature is hot enough for long enough.  But really, the act of cooking in the butter is to bind the cannabinoids to the fat molecules in the butter.  The bud should have already been decarboxylated prior to that, so that the THC-A molecules in the cannabis get converted to THC, so they can fit properly in the body's cannabinoid receptors.   Also 230* for 110 minutes sounds like some vape might be lost   Well, the scientists in the article I linked to don't seem to think so.  Here's another decarboxylation chart for reference.   Cuz that's how long I do my fire crackers   But isn't that with Already Been Vaped bud, i.e. already been decarboxylated?  You don't need any time on that if so."

mflb,3612gl,comeatmebreau,0,Mon May 18 06:25:01 2015 UTC,I agree completely.  The stuff tastes terrible and it takes a ton of it to get me high.  I think I ate 8 grams last time and it only got me to an 8 or so.  I don't know how people get high at all from a gram or two.  The only reason I save avb is because it's free.

I also think the Canadian dime may be lighter than others too. It almost feels lighter than these bb's.

mflb,3600sy,damagedvectors,1 point,Fri May 15 19:05:50 2015 UTC,"it's really not so much the weight, as it is the large, flat surface area pushing anything under it against the mesh.    the minimal push-contact of a sphere cuts that to nil, while the rolling still keeps the jostling action against the plant matter to knock off trichomes.      i understand you realize this, this is more of an FYI for others who read this.

mflb,360cdz,BestintheWest219,6,Fri May 15 00:48:52 2015 UTC,"Try taking either a tollerence break for a week, or look at some other methods for hitting the box.  Also, batteries can loose their juoce after a while. Or your box may need a clean.      Theres a lot of factors to take into consideration really, but a good clean, new batteries, sipping/stacking method and a finishing grinder is the way to go. :)"

mflb,35yfgy,gaflar,2,Thu May 14 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"I recon I'll probably stick with the official ones, the powerex/maha ones work out a similar price from what I can see"
mflb,35yfgy,throwitawayfool2,3,Thu May 14 19:33:48 2015 UTC,"Powerex 2700's are way better than the stock batteries. After using them you'll wonder why they don't come as stock in the first place, they function much better than stock - the box runs hotter, the light is brighter, and the batteries last longer. And when you have 4, you can always have 2 charging and 2 in use. I'm currently on my second set after burning out the first ones."
mflb,35yfgy,gaflar,2,Thu May 14 22:03:18 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, are you comparing the 2700s to the stock batteries that used to come with the box in the past, or the newer Glyph batteries that now come standard?"
mflb,35yfgy,throwitawayfool2,2,Fri May 15 02:40:50 2015 UTC,I can't say I know much about the Glyph batteries. My box is a few years old so I must have the older batteries you're talking about.
mflb,35yfgy,gaflar,2,Fri May 15 07:28:32 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  From my understanding, the general consensus is that the Powerex 2700s were definitely recommended up until the point that the ""Glyph"" batteries appeared, and now they're recommended instead.  The Glyphs are closer to 2400 mAH in overall capacity, and they act as a hybrid of LSD and HSD technology (low- and high-self-discharge).  This has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, so I'm very curious to know if the Powerex 2700s are still worth a purchase."

I like the method of letting the chamber filling with vapor, pulling just that volume into your lungs/mouth, waiting a few seconds and pulling in the next volume followed by letting off the battery and clearing the chamber.  I usually do two pulls four times in a row, it minimizes the amount of vapor you exhale and waste."

mflb,35ugx5,D1STURBED36,2,Wed May 13 17:43:52 2015 UTC,"Hold battery in, when you see vapor start coming and covering the red light start your inhale."
mflb,35ugx5,infinity1018,1 point,Wed May 13 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"The only way I can do the stacking method is if I'm at a resting heart rate, otherwise I run out of breath and my heart starts racing, so my hits aren't as good. That's why I always make sure to take a couple deep breaths in before I start my next hit so I have enough oxygen reserves to hit the vape slowly for 20-30 seconds.   Taking fast draws decreases the internal temperature because you are drawing in cooler air from the outside at a faster rate than the vape can heat the air inside. The mflb was made for slow draws. You will not break the screen, but you may notice your herb flying around the internal chamber if you draw too hard (you want to keep all your herb in the trench area, not on the sides).  As far as your question about stems, I always take out the stems and keep them in a separate baggie, then when I'm out of bud (or even when I'm not and the bag is just getting full) I'll vape just the stems to a nice, even, light brown and toss them in with the rest of my AVB.  Edit: Do you use batteries or the power adapter? If you're seeing thick smoke, you're engaging the power for too long and you probably combusted it, which breaks rule number one in the world of vaping. I suggest investing in the power adapter. Yes, it's a little pricey at $80, but IMO it's well worth the investment."

I got this mflb because i thought i could avoid the panic attacks but it seems  the opposite.  Not saying its a bad device. Its very nicely made.  I actually bought a second one because my first one broke...the screen only after 2 days.  My major question is  how  many seconds do you hold the battery from start to finish (including inhaling)?  I think i maybe holding the battery in too long. Maybe"

If your paranoid thoughts continue, think about getting a professional opinion to rule out something serious or at least take a break from consumption. Try getting bud from a different source or a different strain if you want to continue vaping."
mflb,35usb8,icetep,4,Wed May 13 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as someone who has had his fair share of weed driven panic attacks i think its safe to say that if OP were to take a big rip from a bong he'd get panicky as well. My advice to OP is to get high slowly, as i've found (for me at least) going from sober to very high induces panic attacks far more often than gradually getting higher. Also, OP, if you find yourself getting panicky on weed again then eat a couple black pepper corns as they have something in them that helps counteract what causes panic in cannabis."

Its an awesome combo, and I actually prefer using the lotus through the orbiter instead of the lotus with draw stem dry. I mean, the flavour is much better dry, but with the orbiter it takes out the guess work of how hot you're vaping, as you can visibly see vapour production as you draw, and so can easily adjust the flame height to control temps."
mflb,35skod,stinkiefart,11,Wed May 13 03:50:13 2015 UTC,"yeah the batteries should help out a lot if those batteries had reached their limit. also make sure you have a fine grind of herb in the box, it really makes a difference."
mflb,35skod,put1man,4,Wed May 13 04:05:55 2015 UTC,A year and a half? Definitely the batteries. Cleaning with some iso never hurts though.
mflb,35skod,Night-Man,4,Wed May 13 05:21:20 2015 UTC,"If you use your MFLB at home a lot I really would recommend the PA. Works much better for me, due to the precise temperature control.  What also made a lot difference for me was the UFO (you might also choose the Orbiter or any homemade bubbling device). The draw is much smoother and cooler, which lets you draw much longer than usually. The first time I used my UFO I was really surprised how different the result was."
mflb,35skod,CptRotzbarbe,2,Wed May 13 06:23:21 2015 UTC,"due to the precise temperature control.   the PA only controls power. as with batts, temp control is 100% controlled by your draw rate."
mflb,35skod,I_Submit_This,3,Wed May 13 07:57:56 2015 UTC,"That's correct. But with the PA it's IMHO much more easier to maintain the best temperature for vaping in the trench without the risk of combustion.  I mostly use about 60 % power (slightly beyond the 50 % mark) and that's perfect for my usual drawing speed and I don't have to change my speed.  When I use batteries, I mostly use the sipping method and pulse with the battery."

Held each battery in the box for a solid 5 minutes until there was NO heat coming off the screen, then put them on my 4 port NiMH Energizer charger, they looked like they were still charging after 6 hours but the next day they were great.  I am not an authority on battery chemistry and technology, but anecdotaly this worked for me"
mflb,35skoe,unique_username_384,2,Wed May 13 07:18:11 2015 UTC,"While I am not sure if this applies to NiMH cells as well there is a special pre-charge phase at least for lithium cells. It is only used if the voltage is below some threshold (~2.8V for lithium I think, perhaps ~0.8V for NiMH?). The cells get charged with a very low constant current (0.1C or lower) until the voltage has passed the threshold when normal (1C) charging takes over.  I guess the supplied charger isn't the best quality there is, probably lacks this feature (if it exists for nickel accumulators as well) and thus displays the error message, where as the Energizer can cope with it no questions asked... I'm sure it supports fast charging as well!   I have heard that the nickel chemistry tends to deteriorate over time because of crystals forming. Those can supposedly be broken with short, high current pulses.   Don't quote me on any of the above though!"

mflb,35p9gr,Angelsomething,23,Tue May 12 11:55:14 2015 UTC,"Looks like a broken screen? Use the guide on the sidebar to claim a new box, I've heard it's a strauight forward process if you follow the instructions.   Hope that helps :)"
mflb,35p9gr,imflb,6,Tue May 12 12:07:57 2015 UTC,"It's a really easy process, the m-f team makes it really simple.  It's not even an annoyance to do."
mflb,35p9gr,Just_A_Guy_Eh,5,Tue May 12 12:30:59 2015 UTC,"yeah, mflb is so great on its warrantys i think other companies should learn from them."
mflb,35p9gr,youshedo,21,Tue May 12 14:27:16 2015 UTC,"Do it yourself method:  1) submit warranty claim  2) wait 3) get new box in mail 4) now you've done it yourself!   Seriously though, not much you can do here to fix that tear. Only option for that box's future is to buy a replacement screen for the MD and use it as a make-shift MD like many people have done."
mflb,35p9gr,lilclark326,7,Tue May 12 14:00:50 2015 UTC,"Even if there was a way to fix it, it could potentially cook herb unevenly or cause more damage to the screen. Warranty exchange is your best bet."
mflb,35p9gr,RighteousCookies,13,Tue May 12 12:30:39 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone! will go with the warranty!

mflb,35p9gr,happyself,1 point,Tue May 12 17:54:45 2015 UTC,Now I see it.  Thanks!
mflb,35p9gr,danketree,1 point,Tue May 12 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"get a new one under the warranty, then go onto the mflb site and buy some of the concentrate screens as they fit onto the railings that the mesh is attached to."
mflb,35p9gr,Night-Man,1 point,Wed May 13 03:09:12 2015 UTC,Concentrate screens? Or will the Maud-Dib replacement screens work?
mflb,35p9gr,I_Submit_This,1 point,Thu May 14 15:41:15 2015 UTC,Maud-Dib replacement screens
mflb,35p9gr,danketree,1 point,Thu May 14 16:11:11 2015 UTC,"yeah, meant to say the maud dib screen."
mflb,35p9gr,MeEvilBob,1 point,Thu May 14 23:56:19 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed the way the box is made is by passing a much stronger electrical current through the mesh than normal to melt it to the rails.  Maybe (with the right equipment) you could get it back on that way.  Definately don't use any kind of glue or solder as you don't want to be sucking on those fumes, but if you can melt the mesh back to the rail you might have a chance.  That being said, still submit a warranty claim because even though the above advice is the best I can answer your question, even I have my doubts that it would actually work well."
mflb,35pnkt,dandaman919,10,Tue May 12 14:08:58 2015 UTC,I always hear a high pitched whirring sound when I have my batteries plugged into the charger. Nothing alarming but when I notice it I can't unhear it.
mflb,35pnkt,herooftime94,4,Tue May 12 15:20:57 2015 UTC,Mine does that too; it's tremendously aggravating.
mflb,35pnkt,jokingrotten,4,Tue May 12 15:42:46 2015 UTC,That sound is the reason the batteries have to charge in the bathroom so we dont go nuts. Dont forget to take them out right as they go green:)
mflb,35pnkt,laliloleelee,2,Tue May 12 20:59:15 2015 UTC,I believe they slowly drain if you take them out of the charger because of the type of batteries they are.
mflb,35pnkt,Ressotami,2,Tue May 12 21:19:47 2015 UTC,Not even that slowly I'm afraid. The Glyphs lose approx 60-80% of their capacity in 24h. This is a drawback of the hybrid batteries. Better than LSD and Worse than HSD.
mflb,35pnkt,laliloleelee,1 point,Tue May 12 21:50:27 2015 UTC,"Dang y'all. Mine are super sucky now, this makes sense. I think I'm gonna read up on this kind of battery before I replace them."
mflb,35pnkt,adeadhead,0,Wed May 13 04:44:36 2015 UTC,"That's fine, it's energy disipation. If you leave it in for a long time (days) it could start to overheat"
mflb,35pnkt,Ressotami,5,Tue May 12 14:10:20 2015 UTC,"This is false. You can leave it in for any length of time without any danger.  It also isn't ""energy dissipation"" or ""getting rid of excess energy"" as you describe.  The miniaturized transformers and coils within the charger itself making ""coil noise"". Most electrical appliances do this but miniaturizing components makes the noise more pronounced as they have less mass to dampen vibrations so vibrate more within their housings."
mflb,35pnkt,bunnykittyhamster,2,Tue May 12 19:15:22 2015 UTC,"Can confirm it's coil noise (source: mad tinkerer). If you're able to hear it, best make peace with that fact or it will beat you. Give it 10 years and you won't hear it anymore (due to old age, yours , not the charger's).  (I used to warranty devices with coil noise in the hopes of getting one that wasn't a lemon.. Trust me, they're all lemons when it comes to squealing coils.)  On topic: it's harmless :)"
mflb,35pnkt,adeadhead,2,Tue May 12 21:45:12 2015 UTC,its been plugged in since i got it a few months ago...is that bad? I usually just leave the batteries in the charger if Im not using them
mflb,35pnkt,I_Submit_This,-1,Tue May 12 14:29:42 2015 UTC,"No no, it's fine. The power draw just doesn't match. The sound sound and heat is the process by which the excess is being gotten rid of. I mean, not like it would hurt to unplug it when not in use."
mflb,35pnkt,Princess_Goddamit,2,Tue May 12 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"ah ok, I just noticed the sound last night and I was at an [8] so I naturally thought my house was gonna burn down lol. Glad to know its all good. And I leave it plugged in cuz I use my box daily. Thanks man"
mflb,35pnkt,I_Submit_This,2,Tue May 12 14:44:11 2015 UTC,NiMH batts and smart chargers can be left plugged in & charging almost indefinitely. it's a basic design characteristc of NiMH batts.
mflb,35pnkt,Princess_Goddamit,2,Tue May 12 15:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yah I know that, I remember reading that when I was researching before I bought my box. Just wanted to make sure my charger wasn't going to splode on me"
mflb,35rkhz,Syed888,3,Tue May 12 22:40:42 2015 UTC,I think it is much more likely that it is the strain/type of weed you have. Have you vaped this specific stash in the pax you mentioned using before? Or tried using a different strain/type of weed in the mflb? I'd try taking either of the routes I just mentioned before deciding the mflb is causing your sudden anxiety.
mflb,35rkhz,sk1nnyjeans,3,Wed May 13 00:30:57 2015 UTC,No first time im vaping this kind which is a completely brown strong indica.
mflb,35rkhz,sk1nnyjeans,3,Wed May 13 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"Okay! Then I strongly recommend picking up a small amount of another strain, or swap buds with a friend, and try the newly acquired strain in your mflb. I'm very certain you won't experience the same anxiety.  I've experienced the same anxiety you mentioned from certain strains, and all it took was trying a different strain to avoid that. I hope the same helps you :)"
mflb,35rkhz,sk1nnyjeans,2,Wed May 13 02:14:55 2015 UTC,Thanks. Do you normally choose green color strains  just wondering
mflb,35rkhz,sk1nnyjeans,1 point,Wed May 13 02:27:42 2015 UTC,"No problem, I'm glad to be helping! Most strains I come across in my area are green, so its not so much as choosing green color, but just what is available for me to acquire. Keep in mind though that color isn't always a good indicator of the effects you'll feel. I'm not sure if you have any green colored strains in your area, but I'd consider getting it just because its most likely a different strain than what you currently have. It doesn't need to be green though, just generally different than your current supply."
mflb,35rkhz,GOPokemonMaster,2,Wed May 13 02:42:12 2015 UTC,Ok thanks.  I also had a question for the mflb...when I start seeing the vapor down the stem..do I inhale then? or do I have to wait for the vapor to come out of the stem and then I inhale?
mflb,35rkhz,sk1nnyjeans,1 point,Wed May 13 15:39:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're first thought was correct! Once you see it in the stem, begin to slowly inhale. No need to wait for it to actually come out of the stem."
mflb,35rkhz,sk1nnyjeans,-8,Thu May 14 03:45:20 2015 UTC,OP is dumb lol
mflb,35rkhz,LikelyEatingTacoBell,3,Wed May 13 04:15:05 2015 UTC,Sounds more like OP's just young and/or still learning a bit about cannabis and its use. Gotta give OP a chance!
mflb,35rkhz,OrlandoCaballoPajero,2,Wed May 13 14:05:57 2015 UTC,Thanks guys for the responses.  @Sk1nnyjeans. That is probably too. This strain was indica and all brown.  First time I had this kind. I usually like green color indicas. @Orlamdo. Yes I have a very low tolerance. One draw and I start sweating. @sericuse. Thats a good idea. Didnt know about the battery tip.   Because I have been using my battery right after charging and its pretty warm.   In conclusion. I really want to enjoy this box because its so small portable and discreet. I will try out these tips and update soon if you guys are around
mflb,35rkhz,ThePurpleHayes,1 point,Wed May 13 01:45:53 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, reddit uses /u/ instead of the @ symbol. For example, /u/Syed888. But yes, just make a new post when you have new results! I'd be very interested in hearing if your experience improves."
mflb,35rkhz,ParsInterarticularis,2,Wed May 13 02:45:33 2015 UTC,Ok thanks. sorry didn't know.
mflb,35rkhz,nogitsunes,2,Wed May 13 15:40:11 2015 UTC,Update.  Ok I just bought a gram of sabertooth indica. Grinded in my big hole grinder ..put the stem on and didnt put my whole mouth on stem as I have previously have done with my sessions.  This time I slightly half put my mouth on stem and drew inhale for short 3 seconds. And I gotta say iam baked with no sign of panic. But yes mflb is certainly a powerful box. One draw gets me overly baked.  I underestimated its power.

mflb,35reyi,ParsInterarticularis,1 point,Tue May 12 23:09:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, you will notice it more whilst the stem changes from clear to Brown, idk if it's as easily discernable to see the Brown on top of Brown..."
mflb,35n8x3,Herbalist33,9,Mon May 11 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"i don't think they would make it an across the board upgrade, or even just for the basic kit ... cost & price increase.    but as an option, or standard on the monocle edition would probably be doable.    contact them, using their contact form, or at:    customerservice@magic-flight.com    ... they love suggestions."
mflb,35n8x3,I_Submit_This,3,Mon May 11 22:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yea, I figured it would probably add a fairly significant cost (both time and money) to producing a launch box, but as you say, as an optional/premium design it could be a good idea.  Looks like I'm gunna have to contact our lovable hobbit friend and bore him/her with yet another one of my rambling emails 😃."
mflb,35n8x3,I_Submit_This,2,Mon May 11 23:24:05 2015 UTC,he loves 'em ... and passes things around that MFLB hobbit hole through secret tunnels safe from the prying eyes of smaug.
mflb,35n8x3,MegasOros,2,Mon May 11 23:33:05 2015 UTC,I like the thought that all employees at Magic Flight are hobbits :]

mflb,35n8x3,thissayssomething,1 point,Tue May 12 00:36:19 2015 UTC,"I definitely like the idea. I've mentioned in the past, not that I expect anyone to remember, it would be cool if they made the LB in two pieces joined by a hinge and silicone seal, so you could just open it up and pop the under-tray out. Maybe the hinged aspect makes it a bit too complicated, but just putting a tray under there would definitely help.  I think the new muad-dibs have a removable metal trench tray."
mflb,35n8x3,MegasOros,1 point,Mon May 11 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"I'm imagining a removable bottom portion that has 2 slides to lock it in, would be hard to remove (use a needle). It would also carry all your box's information so that would serve as your warranty info, it would cut down the cost of any replacement box's aswell, as well as give you a part of the box that will allways stay with you! Another thought, if you make the top part out of metal (even easier to clean) you could use it to conduct the electricity to the screen too! Seems like a cool idea 8)"
mflb,35n8x3,WoodyWeedpecker,1 point,Tue May 12 00:42:00 2015 UTC,Neat idea.  This and a removable trench (like the muadib) would be a nice upgrade.
