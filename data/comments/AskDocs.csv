It may be nothing serious, but the combination of symptoms you are describing could be congestive heart failure or the beginnings of an infarct.  Feelings of heartburn combined with shortness of breath, a new cough, new headache, new chest pain, and feeling weak and out of energy, sounds like a heart problem.   Now that I've scared you to death, I want you to know that because of your age it is unlikely to be heart related. However, with that said, I wouldn't hesitate in getting it checked out either."

Lots of people go to the ED for bullshit, but going for pain is never bullshit. Just go. We can't evaluate it through a computer.  Could be diverticulitis (or any number of other things) which can end in peritonitis which can end your time here with us on this lovely fine planet.   Time to get in the car."

AskDocs,3e510d,CapoAria,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:18:40 2015 UTC,What does GERD/PUD mean? Thanks :)
AskDocs,3e510d,CapoAria,2,Wed Jul 22 02:54:04 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry. GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disease, or just plain old ""reflux"". It typically causes a heartburn-like sensation in or around the middle of the stomach and usually comes on 30-60 minutes after eating. It's aggravated by certain foods, chocolate, alcohol, etc. Essentially, the acid in your stomach ""refluxes"" back into your esophagus. The stomach is built for the acidic environment -- the esophagus, on the other hand is not. Thus, the pain. It's very common and easily manageable for the most part.   PUD is peptic ulcer disease. They can be caused by many things, but the most common are by H. Pylori (a bacteria) or chronic NSAID use (using a lot of Ibuprofen over time, for instance). You can typically get them in your stomach or duodenum (first part of your small intestine). Stomach ulcers tend to be aggravated by eating, although this is not set in stone anywhere. Regardless, it's also fairly common and manageable.   Edit: Diverticulitis is inflammation of diverticula, or outpouchings in your large intestine. You need to have diverticulosis (a fairly common disease but typically reserved for the older population) to have diverticulitis first. Having diverticulitis at 22 is highly unlikely. Not to mention you would also have additional symptoms like a low-grade fever, change in bowel habits, etc. Your pain would typically be localized in the lower left part of your stomach as well. All the clues together lead me far away from diverticulitis.   Peritonitis is a potential complication of untreated diverticulitis. Don't worry about that. Regardless, go see your doctor when you can and (as a disclaimer), go to the ER if things get worse or you develop other concerning symptoms."
AskDocs,3e510d,CapoAria,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:04:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. The pain I'm experiencing seems really accurate to what you described with the GERD. Is there anyways to make this go away? I'm going to get a doctors appointment as soon as possible as well.
AskDocs,3e4pey,Miakoda,5,Tue Jul 21 22:57:36 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't matter. You need to make sure that you consistently eat less calories than you burn up, preferably in a varied diet that mainly consists of plant matter."
AskDocs,3e4pey,Ulsenius,2,Tue Jul 21 23:23:53 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with the doc here (classic nurse behavior).  Number of meals doesn't matter, same with the time you eat them (after 8—who cares?). Eating something does promote bowel motility though, so it's not a bad thing to eat 3 or more. You don't have to freak out about eating 6 small meals a day though. The moral of this story is calories in vs calories out. You will burn calories just by living. Count 'em, cut 'em, and stick with it.  Calculate an estimate of your base metabolic rate (google it), and eat fewer calories than that. Or exercise to burn the excess (harder, but also good for you). Eating protein is great for satiation. Eat lots of leafy greens too. Salads can be shockingly low cal, so long as you aren't overdoing it on the dressing, and this is also good to keep your gut healthy and moving. Don't starve yourself and remember that everything takes time. Calorie-counting works well, but it is a lot of work."
AskDocs,3e4pey,flanl,2,Wed Jul 22 01:03:09 2015 UTC,Do you recommend any accurate BMR calculators? I looked it up and I'm getting around 1800 calories and I know that's not right.
AskDocs,3e4pey,flanl,2,Wed Jul 22 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"They can get very complex, but don't let that stop you from just getting started. I calculated mine for a nutrition class a couple years ago, and we had a several page booklet to do it (but let's keep in mind that nutritionists also want to show you just how serious they are about that sort of thing). For the purpose of starting a diet, that might be needlessly complex. 1800 might not be too far off, but your BMR will be higher with a higher BMI, and your BMR will shrink as your BMI does.  A lot of these calculators probably underestimate the BMRs of women since they typically have less muscle and mass than men. You might not be typical, so find one that asks more questions. ""___ yrs old, ___ height ___ lbs ___ly active"" is probably what your answering, and although that's not perfect, it's not a bad place to start either.  Short answer: nope, I don't, but they're definitely out there! If I was at work I'd just refer you to the nutritionist because I'm not an expert here."

AskDocs,3e4vfj,TiredOfYourShit21,2,Tue Jul 21 23:45:54 2015 UTC,"I am not a doctor, just a nursing student/EMT, but you should probably see a general practitioner about this issue.  It is possible you have a hyperthyroid problem causing your overheating.  Simple blood tests can screen for this issue but they are not usually done on a routine check up unless you bring up an issue causing your doctor to suspect thyroid issues.  Have you checked your core temperatures throughout the day, especially during periods where you feel like you are overheating?    I think you should also be careful drinking that massive amount of water on a daily basis.  You are going to be eliminating a lot of electrolytes when your kidneys process that much water, and that can throw your electrolyte balance out of whack. This can cause symptoms such as dizziness, headache, nausea, cardiac arrhythmia, etc.   Please consider supplementing with some additional sodium and eat foods containing potassium (banana, avocado, orange juice) if you continue to drink that excessive amount of water."

AskDocs,3e3xo8,patient3,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:58 2015 UTC,"Schizophrenia is a thought disorder that contains a spectrum of symptoms. The most recognizable include hallucinations (usually auditory), delusions, disorganization, etc. -- these are considered ""positive"" symptoms. ""Negative"" symptoms in schizophrenia represent an absence or decrease of normal processes and can include decreased expressiveness, flat affect, or a lack of energy.   Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that consists of manic and major depressive episodes (bipolar I) OR at least one hypomanic episode (not as extreme as full blown mania), one major depressive episode, and the absence of a manic episode.   When it comes to differentiating the two, a resource I use states the following:   ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depression with psychotic features all differ from schizophrenia in that there is a prominent mood component to the patient’s presentation.""  Misdiagnosis is always a reality in the world of medicine.

People talk a lot about genetic therapy, but there's all kinds of ethical issues.  I think we could circumvent all ethics by having a level head about what we do, using opt-in consent and taking a policy of targeting wild genes:  we don't fix you; we use you as a carrier to overwhelm the population and eventually breed certain weaknesses out of human society.  Better health is a side-effect; you are a carrier, not a patient.  The difference isn't really that big.  Search and eliminate congenital disorders in an individual?  Treatment for the rich.  Broadly insert genes to improve the human physical condition?  Humanitarian effort; hell, under that explanation, you could probably get NIH funding to pay for it as a routine part of pregnancy planning--if you can get it approved, and do it cheaply enough.  The goal is suddenly maximum saturation in the population, not individual treatment.  We would, of course, need to guard who exactly is a carrier as a strict secret.

It's used to treat alcoholism and its co-incidentally observed with metronidazole.  Best suggestion; just don't use your mouthwash tonight and start your course of metronidazole now - you'd need to have at least a 12 hour alcohol-free period before taking and 48 hours after taking metronidazole.

AskDocs,3e4ffx,Computing_Dunce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:33:38 2015 UTC,"I couldn't comment as I have no idea regarding the wine content in the sauce but the way that the disulfiram reaction works is that it makes your body metabolise the alcohol into a substance that's the cause of hangover symptoms - it's likely that the amount of alcohol content in the sauce is so minute/may have been destroyed by the cooking process for it not to be an issue.   Also is it ok to take it with just milk instead of a meal?   No.  It needs to be taken with or after food and with a glass of water.
