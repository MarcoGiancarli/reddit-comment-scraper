(Pill plus Today Sponge which is over the counter would be double birth control for even your fears concerning oral sex).   Talk through (to yourself), what ""could have got up there and"" when.

Unless the device was unknowingly expelled (you should be checking your strings regularly), chances are that it's just working like it's supposed to. You still might spot occasionally, so I wouldn't throw away your pads and tampons yet, but irregular bleeding is common in the first three months, and irregular can also mean no bleeding at all.  Personally, I get serious pregnancy anxiety and don't get my period anymore, so every once in awhile I take a pregnancy test just to ease my anxiety. If you go on amazon, you can get super cheap multi-packs of testing strips (I think I bought 60 for $25?). If you are someone who gets anxiety a lot, it can be a stress reliever.

I think I'm going to risk it after a couple of cycles. I've used my cup for a good while, and as long as I break the seal before removing it, and not twisting it or being forceful with it, I'm hoping there's no problems.

I'd wait several cycles to let your cervix get used to the strings and then go for it.

You need to not be on any hormonal bc if you want the hormone tests to work, so while you take a break, you might want to get that checked. Taking combined hormonal birth control is usually what's prescribed for PCOS anyway.  Weight gain on the pill can be down to the amount of oestrogen, the amount and potency of progestogen, and also the androgenicity of the progestogen. Bloating and water retention is usually caused by too much oestrogen/oestrogen dominance, and this will usually rectify itself quickly when you stop taking the pill. Sustained weight gain is normally due to progestogen potency (too strong) and androgenic activity (too high). For instance, women who are sensitive to these things may find that pills containing 30-35mcg EE cause too much water retention. Or they may find that a progestogen-dominant brand causes them to gain weight fairly easily. Pills containing levonorgestrel, for example, a highly potent and androgenic progestogen may increase the chance of weight gain in women who has a sensitivity to progestogens (including those with PCOS).   In terms of coming of the pill, I did this a couple of times when I was younger. I noticed that I got worse PMS, my skin was a little oily and more spotty before my natural period began, I got some ovulation pain (obviously not something I'd get on the pill), and I think I felt more emotional too. I might have had less cravings, but I don't really remember now. Hormonal birth control doesn't affect my libido in a negative way, so there wasn't really a change there - in fact, I probably had less desire when I was off the pill because my moods weren't as stable and I didn't feel ""protected"".  Hope this helps!"
birthcontrol,3e0y5e,shmookieguinz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"I would say that the side effects from going off of the pill are worse. I went off of mine after getting out of a long relationship and I knew I wanted to get an IUD at my next annual visit. I had insane cramping and heavy periods that were so much longer. I got hormonal acne, which I didn't even have during puberty. Looking back, I should have just stuck with it until I could get Mirena inserted.   The hormones in birth control don't have THAT much of an effect on weight loss. Maybe ask your doctor about trying a different pill with a lower hormone dose before completely stopping.   I know you want to ""know your adult body"" but it really won't be your adult body without hormones for a few months and it takes a while after that for your body to get used to its own hormone production, or at least it did for me."

Part of their job is explaining these questions to their patients, I'm sure he or she will clear it all up for you.  But, I think WebMd explains it pretty well:   Begin taking this medication on the first Sunday following the beginning of your menstrual period. If your period begins on a Sunday, begin taking this medication on that day. Your pill pack contains 84 estrogen/progestin pills and 7 estrogen-only pills. Take one estrogen/progestin pill daily for 84 days in a row. The day after you finish all the combination pills, start taking one estrogen-only pill daily for 7 days in a row. You should have your period during the week you are taking the estrogen-only pills. The day after you take the last estrogen-only pill, start a new pack whether or not you have your period. If you do not get your period, consult your doctor.  If this is the first time you are using this medication, use an additional form of non-hormonal birth control (such as condoms, spermicide) for the first 7 days to prevent pregnancy until the medication has enough time to work. If you start on the first day of your period, you do not need to use back-up birth control the first week."

birthcontrol,3dz4vs,depaulbluedemon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:37 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem when I tried to take the pill continuously. My father was an OBYGYN and told me not all women can take the pill that way without breakthrough bleeding.  So I'd recommend you just take it normally,  3 weeks out of every 4. At this point you need to just stop it immediately,  then restart in 7 days. You should use condoms until you restart the pill just in case.  I later found out I continue to ovulate on the pill (and all other hormonal contraception), which is why I couldn't take it continously. While rare (and breakthrough bleeding isn't,  unfortunately), it's possible you are also still ovulating and could get pregnant (I did, despite perfect use of my BCPs). If so,  the only reliable birth control you can use is a copper IUD, which I highly recommend.  FYI, I have awful, debilitating cramps but the IUDs (I've had 2 different copper models) didn't make them worse or otherwise affect my period or cycle.  I had zero side effects."
birthcontrol,3dz4vs,graymaiden,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your answer.  I'm definitely quitting the current BC. At least for now. I'm going to try it again and if the never ending period starts again I'll go see a doc to switch brands.   I'm sceptical about IUDs as my sister is allergic to copper and had lots of issues with hers (besides the allergy, one of hers got pulled out and before that she says she was actually getting pregnant and miscarrying almost every month, so even though it was hormone free, she was going through crazy hormonal doses due to technically getting pregnant), and the idea of something solid being up there all the time freaks me out. There are too many horror stories out there about IUDs, but I guess I'm kind of living one on a completely different method.  I never heard about ovulating while on the pill- that's SCARY. Thank you again, you've been very helpful and given me a lot to think about."
birthcontrol,3dz4vs,graymaiden,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:59:01 2015 UTC,"I strongly suggest you never try taking any BCP continuously again,  bc it is very unlikely that switching to another will help. Most likely you'll tolerate your current pill okay, at the very least the BB should stop, if you take it with the 1 week break monthly vs continuously. Switching to another pill instead of resuming the 3 weeks on/1 week off pattern could further exacerbate your problem and extend your return to normalcy. Possibly taking 1-2 months off all hormonal BC could be the best solution, if that's a possibility for you.  A copper allergy can make a copper IUD problematic, though it's possible to have a superficial skin sensitivity type allergy to copper but tolerate it fine internally (I'm that way with silver; I can't wear it but in oral/injected meds I have no problems).  It's extremely rare for eggs to fertilize with a copper IUD due to copper's effect as a spermicide. But certain religious types perpetuate this myth. I highly doubt your sister was getting pregnant  & miscarrying even once let alone repeatedly.  In my 6 years with copper IUDs, including years of daily sex, I never conceived to my knowledge and I've gotten pregnant several times on the pill and using condoms, despite never having one break. Just to be sure, are you completely sure she had a Paragard not a Mirena IUD?  I'm horrified by the idea of anything implanted inrme, like Norplant, so I can somewhat understand not wanting a foreign object in your uterus. For me it makes all the difference that an IUD is free floating and that I can safely remove it myself at any time, at least in the case of the Paragard.  FYI, most horror stories/fear surrounding IUDs are based on the Dalkon Shield,  an IUD from the 70s that had an absorbent string which bacteria could grow on, increasing risk of infection,  particularly PID which is a serious problem that can lead to permanent infertility.  Also, there's a lot of confusion about the Paragard vs the Mirena, and often the negative hormonal effects of the latter get falsely attributed to both IUDs. In the US this is especially true bc copper IUDs are rarely used.  In Europe where they are vastly more common, there are virtually no horror stories. (I've lived years on both continents.)  I'm definitely biased pro-copper IUDs but they are not right for every woman. If you do consider one, keep in mind you can always remove it at any time if you don't like it.  I hope the bleeding issue normalizes ASAP and you never encounter it again. Also, consider getting your iron (in particular ferritin which is often overlooked) levels checked, since you may be anemic by this point.   Ovulating on hormonal BC is indeed terrifying but fortunately fairly rare. Still, even with perfect use, there's an average 3% potential chance of ovulating AND successfully conceiving on the pill,  though your personal chance of risk could be more or less. Even those who ovulate on the pill often don't conceive bc of how hostile the hormones make your cervical mucus, so sperm rarely survive to reach the egg."

birthcontrol,3dy398,LevyWife,2,Mon Jul 20 14:05:50 2015 UTC,"The stomach cramps are more likely to be due to the excessive drinking. The implant inhibits ovulation, so ovarian cysts are unlikely. The implant releases progestogen directly into the bloodstream. It doesn't go through the digestive system, so it can't be affected by what you ingest/drink.   The same would be true of the hormonal IUD, except for the fact that ovarian cysts are a possibility with this method as it doesn't stop ovulation.   I really hope you get the help you need for the drinking. But rest assured, it won't affect your birth control."

birthcontrol,3dwkb7,zzimushka,2,Mon Jul 20 03:47:46 2015 UTC,"The opinions here will conflict just as much, sadly. I love this sub as it can be a wonderful help, buttttt no matter who you ask or where you go, you can find so many varying opinions on bc forms. That goes for online and offline.  There are so many different options and every body is a little different, so no two experiences are the same.  Personally, I'm quite scared of any form that requires insertion or implantation. I've only ever taken a pill form. I personally know three people (at least!) that have had bad experiences with shots and things that need to be inserted. A friend with Mirena is having it taken out due to side effects that greatly impact her everyday life, my mom used the shot long ago and says she bled constantly, and my boyfriend's sister had an implant get stuck inside of her. It was...uh... being absorbed and she needed to have it surgically removed. Not to scare you (some people love their IUDs and such!), but there are many stories from both sides.  If your pill isn't bothering you and you aren't struggling to take it on time each day, maybe a switch isn't that important? But then again, you can always have an implant removed if it isn't working out!  I've had to try different pill brands to find what works for me. Even within the same form there can be soooo many options.   Best of luck!"
birthcontrol,3dwkb7,Spookyookie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:35:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response! The reason I'm wanting to switch from the pill is that I want something that I don't have to take every day. I'm a bit paranoid, so I want to be covered :)"

birthcontrol,3dwkb7,GlowHallow,2,Mon Jul 20 07:51:07 2015 UTC,"I was on the pill for about 6 years before getting my implant just under two weeks ago. The side effects I've experienced so far include being emotional, some stomach pain/cramping, a itchy and swollen feeling at insertion site and some breast pain. All in all I'm getting on well with it so far, none of the side effects have stopped me from living normally day to day.   As others have said there is such a wide variety of side effects people get and you don't know how you're going to react to it. One thing I will say is you often hear about the horror stories online and not from those who the implant has worked for. I would definitely recommend the implant so far, and even if you end up having bad side effects you can get it taken out with a simple and quick procedure :)"

Okay, gross question, but was it all fresh blood or did it start off darker/clotted? Clotted blood is more period-typical but if it's all fresh, you might have had bleeding from a cyst or an ectopic pregnancy. Are you still in a lot of pain? Is the pain more localized to one side?  It's probably just your body have a freak cycle, which does happen occasionally, but since it could be a sign of something more serious, it's better to rule them out."

I've had it for nearly 3 years now and have bumped it, poked at it and even thought it was bumped hard enough that it snapped in half. But, it takes quite a bit to break them. I doubt it's bent because it's going through your fat and skin (very squishy)   So, I mean it could be bent.. but not likely. It's probably just swollen and stuff from just having it inserted. If it gives you discomfort after all swelling/bruising goes down then maybe give your doctors office a call. But if it's not bothering you then I don't think it's anything to worry about."

I guess you could say my libido cooled down a bit, but I chalk that up more to the fact that it was put in when I was 21 and in college, and now my hormones aren't quite so zippy.

birthcontrol,3dq99y,britlikespenguins,4,Sat Jul 18 11:50:53 2015 UTC,When I stopped taking the pill the same thing happened to me. Your body is used to not having to make hormones and it is taking time for it to produce enough to trigger ovulation and a period. When it happened to me the doctors I saw kind of shrugged and told me it's not normal and I could go back on birth control if I want periods again. That wasn't what I wanted so I waited it out and started having normal periods in about a year.   Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a cheap 20 pack of pregnancy tests on Amazon. Take one every month if it makes you feel better.

I basically just waited it out and took tests when needed."
birthcontrol,3dq99y,Himekat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:53:20 2015 UTC,Transitioning off of hormonal birth control can take 3 months to one year. During that time your cycle can be irregular. So much so that you skip a cycle or two.   If you haven't had a period by the end of August schedule an apt with your doctor for testing and possibly some hormones (for short term) to restart your cycle.
birthcontrol,3do7m1,frappucci-NO,2,Fri Jul 17 21:47:33 2015 UTC,"Hi, there!   I had nexplanon from early December of last year to June of this year. The first three months were normal ish periods, then came the nonstop bleeding. I stopped for maybe three weeks total from February to June, otherwise, I just kept bleeding and spotting. I was getting angry and frustrated and tired of the implant, but I knew I couldn't remember to take the pill.   I went to my doctor and she suggested going on the pill before deciding to take it out, and I agreed. I got through two weeks of a 24-day pill set (Lomedia or another brand with an L and a green cover)  before giving up and getting the implant taken out.   I did forget to take the pill several times, but even when I took it on time, the bleeding never stopped. When I got the implant taken out, my doctor suggested the Nuva Ring, another form of bc that you don't really need to remember, other than removing it once a month and replacing it a couple of days later.   She also gave me a patch to wear that gave me some hormones that did the trick in stopping my period. I had to keep it on my belly for four or so days, then I did that once more, just to make sure. I just took my ring out two days ago and I'm waiting until Sunday to replace it with another. So far, no spotting at all during the ring being in me. I'm so happy I don't need pads everyday anymore.   I hope my experiences help in deciding. I ultimately couldn't deal with the constant bleeding, and the implant wasn't for me. Maybe you could try a combination pill to stop it, as that was basically what my patch did. The pill only gave me one type of hormone and I needed the other. Good luck, and I'll answer any questions you may have! :) Sorry it's so long!"

birthcontrol,3do7m1,Katzuh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:52:47 2015 UTC,"Never really heard of this doubling up method, but my doctor told me that whatever the pattern is for the first three months that will likely happen every month with the implant. I've only had mine for about a month or so, and have only had one day where I noticed I was spotting.   BUT when I was simply on the pill and taking them back to back for no period (I have blood issues), I noticed that after about 3 months the spotting reached its threshold and it would be so annoying that I'd just let myself have a period. So 4 periods a year. It seems like your body is going through the same thing. I've had good results with Sprintec as a pill. I'd suggest either dropping the implant and switching to a pill completely (since the bleeding is heavy enough to be annoying) or keep it and deal with the bleeding.   I'm obviously not in the same boat as you, but I like to think a perk to continuous birth control is minimal periods, so if you're bleeding constantly it might be best to try another method."

My doctor gave me a prescription of estradiol (spell check) and doxycicline (for the acne) and I took that for about a month, and eventually it evened out and stopped. He said my body just needed to get used to the implant and the first couple months would probably be the worst.

My uterus hated the IUD.  Edit: For the first month with Skyla, I had very sharp poking pains on one side, and it felt like the IUD poking my uterus. It was a very dinstinct pain and I had never felt it before. After the pain finally stopped, thats when the bloating started to get worse"
birthcontrol,3dng8e,janee346,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:01:27 2015 UTC,Hmm maybe I have a similar situation as you. A lot of spotting/periods as well.

birthcontrol,3dpclx,Ephemeral_Halcyon,3,Sat Jul 18 03:59:57 2015 UTC,"It probably is not your fault that it slipped, there's a 5-7% chance of it happening on its own. It is somewhat hard to pull it out, takes like a clamp and some fanagling. Trust me, you didn't suction it out.  If it's free, go for it! The likelihood it will get ejected again is higher. This happened to me as well. It really comes down to whether you wanna go through the fuss of another insertion and checking the strings obsessively with the paranoia that it will come out again.   I know exactly how you feel about wanting it to work. I did too. Hormones suck. I'm gonna try again after I have kids."

birthcontrol,3dpclx,WhiteNightThrowaway,2,Sat Jul 18 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"My $0.02 advice is to try again and use something other than a cup for the first month or two. Most expulsions happen in the first 6 weeks I believe, so if you can be super careful during that time span you may be able to try the menstrual cup again later."
birthcontrol,3dpclx,cupcakery,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:56:53 2015 UTC,"It's not super likely that just the cup caused it to expel. The highest risk of expulsion is shortly after you get the IUD, especially during times of heavy bleeding. It just happens some of the time. Most women have no problem using a cup with an IUD.   Talk to your gyn about if trying another paragard might be your best option. If gyn is okay with you using a cup with the IUD, I'd probably still wait out a couple periods after insertion to be sure. Also, I'd look into getting a softer cup that's easier to break the suction on so there's no risk of tugging during removal."
birthcontrol,3dpclx,a-bit-just,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"Not blaming you, but If it was your fault it slipped, that wouldn't be the same as your body expelling it.  Totally try again.

birthcontrol,3dogr0,paintedLady318,3,Fri Jul 17 23:03:42 2015 UTC,"I was in your same situation (expelled after six months), and the doctor said I would be at a much higher risk for expulsion (much higher than 5%) so I could try but I would most likely expel within a year again.  Which is why I got a tubal ligation instead. It is very simple and is only a 15 minute procedure. Recovery is 2-3 days.   My story:  I got a tubal ligation with Filshie Clips.It has the best effective rate I could find (lifetime average effective rate of 99.75% see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16259814 or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24560346/?i=1&amp;amp;from=filshie%20clips)  Cost: Because of the new health care law the entire procedure was 100% covered.   My surgery was scheduled for 8:00 am on Friday. I told the anesthesiologist that I get nauseous under general anesthesia so they put a patch behind my ear to help. Then one of the nurses gave me an IV. I peed right before, so I wouldn’t need a catheter (and I didn’t). The nurse then put blue leg warmers on my legs to help prevent blood clots. Around 8:00 am the anesthesiologist came and gave me valium through the IV. I was then rolled into the OR.   Post-OP: I woke up wide awake and the patch worked so I was not nauseous. Pain was basically a bad period cramp type of feeling, but no real ‘pain’ per se. The doctor came back and told me everything was normal and that the actual procedure took 15 minutes. She made the first incision into my belly button (but because she was so awesome no scar there). The second incision is below my bikini line. Around 10 am I got dressed by myself and left.   Tips: Wear loose fitting PJs and a thin maxi pad. Bring a bottle of water to drink after as your throat is sore from breathing tube. Have a pillow in the car for the seat belt.   Recovery:  I went home and slept. I could walk around fine, I was just tired. The pain pills made me even more tired. All weekend, I just watched TV with my husband. I was sore, but just like too many sit-ups sore. I went back to work on Monday.   Tips: Heating pad and Popsicles   Summary: It was way simpler and easy than I thought! I have one tiny 1/2 inch scar below my bikini line that is slowly fading. The tubal ligation was the best thing I ever did!"

I've read a lot online about people who say that after their Mirena was removed, their entire personality changed (generally from being depressed or apathetic) and they say that they had no idea how much the Mirena had changed them until it was gone.  So, anything is possible, but definitely worth checking out!

I started on Yasmin first, and personally I hated it. I was a different person on Yasmin and the physical/psychological symptoms were unbearable: drastic mood swings and variably different personality (everyone noticed), my breasts were always tender/sore, constant cramps/bloating, and certainly didn't address acne issues.  I actually switched from Yasmin to Gildess after my boyfriend and I decided to sit down and educate ourselves on the different types. I knew the pill was my preferred choice of birth control but the important question was which one. During our research, we learned about combination birth control and how pills vary in levels of estrogen. http://contraception.about.com/od/thepill/tp/PillCategories.htm  My boyfriend and I figured out I was estrogen sensitive after tracking my symptoms as I took Yasmin (estrogen level in pills increase each week)  I finally settled on a low estrogen pill and decided on Loestrin 1/20 (this has a lower dose of hormones - 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 1.00 mg norethindrone) aka Gildess FE 1-20 http://contraception.about.com/od/pillbrands/g/Loestrin.htm    Went to a new gyno told her what I wanted and why and she agreed with me 100%. And told me even without having done the research, she would've recommended gildess to me based on my symptoms.  Bottom line: Much happier with Gildess. It addressed all my PMS symptoms. No more bloating, no more cramps, not as moody (aka back to my old self), and my periods are MUCH lighter and much more predictable. It works right away and never had problems with it."

With those, there is little room for user error so you won't be as anxious about things like missing a pill or throwing up after taking a pill.

She explained that NOT getting your period on these pills is COMPLETELY normal, that the uterine lining starts to thin and that's why you will stop bleeding eventually altogether.

With combination pills, the 'period' you get is withdrawal bleeding triggered by the drop in hormones when you go from active pills to placebo pills (or no pills, depending on the brand) - and most women do continue to have this withdrawal bleed, but on some particular pill brands it is quite common to not bleed.

You have no need to be worried, the pill is doing its job, particularly if you are taking it regularly as you should. Like /u/Sleepingbeautybitch said, your uterine lining does not build up to prepare for a child, so it makes it less likely for you to have a period. I've been on multiple forms of progestogen-only birth control for this reason, as I would have too painful periods without it. Based on the fact that you don't feel any other weird symptoms, there is no cause for alarm that I see here. But if you are really worried, it's always best to go talk to your doctor.

Some people will carry on having a monthly period, some will have much lighter periods, some will have infrequent periods and some will have no bleeding.

I believe it is a common side-effect of taking such a high hormone dose.   If you took it immediately after sex it should be effective (it can take up to 72 hours to fertilize an egg- the sooner you take it, the better). Also, ovulation occurs two weeks before your period, so right after your period should be lower risk (but still not guaranteed).   You will likely have to wait to take a pregnancy test until a certain time (6 days before the start of your missed period is First Response). Because you took so many of the pills, your cycle may be late for that reason. But, a pregnancy test is a good way to know the cause of irregularity for certain.  In the future, condoms or a formal birth control method would be a better option with A LOT less risk and uncertainty. The morning after pill is not meant to be a primary method, but a back up. Stay safe! :)  edit: after all, it is referred to mainly as ""emergency contraception""  http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/morning-after-pill/basics/definition/prc-20012891"

It will be accurate now because it's been almost 6 weeks, just follow the instructions. Also, EC is for emergencies! Don't try this again, okay?"
birthcontrol,3di4j4,ekdp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:35:14 2015 UTC,Is there a reason you will have to switch? I've switched doctors and never had an issue continuing my old BC. If you tell them it works for you and you like it they shouldn't change it.
birthcontrol,3di4j4,rissybean,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"True, I was thinking of going back to my old BC and I'm afraid they won't have this one specifically in the States. But good point, I'll consider that!"
birthcontrol,3dhu9g,beautifulmessiam,5,Thu Jul 16 11:51:13 2015 UTC,A pill with less hormones will likely not help with spotting. You would need more hormones to keep your body from spotting.

birthcontrol,3dhu9g,GlowHallow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:38:53 2015 UTC,"I'm currently on a daily pill, and have terrible issues with spotting, stress-bleeding and improptu visits from Aunt Flo. I'll get light periods for up to two months at a time, and it's killing me. I'm looking into using Lady's Mantle or Shepherd's Purse as an herbal aid -it's said they can help reduce or stop periods. I've read some really good things about them, but still need to talk to my doctor about it. I only just heard about it yesterday, you might take a look?"
birthcontrol,3dhu9g,Bloody_dumb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:27:44 2015 UTC,"Once you're on the pill and come off, it takes time for your body to adjust again. If you're back on the pill, spotting usually lasts 3 months after you restart."
birthcontrol,3dh09o,strawberriesandpuns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:05:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like mine got a bit worse,  but it's hard to tell.  It's more focused on my cheeks/jawline and when I was younger it seemed to happen further up.  But whatever,  it's not that bad and I don't care that much."
birthcontrol,3dh09o,Bokonomy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:22:08 2015 UTC,Did you have moderate/severe acne when you were younger? Do you think it has calmed down over time? Thank you so much for your response.
birthcontrol,3dh09o,Bokonomy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:16 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Mine was always more moderate.  I don't think it made a huge difference.  I've heard of some people using both an IUD and a more acne controlling bc at the same time if your main concern is preventing pregnancy.  I haven't tried it,  though."
birthcontrol,3dh09o,ichakura,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:35 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I've never heard of doing that. I'll ask my doctor about that next time! Thank you!"
birthcontrol,3dh09o,ichakura,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:47 2015 UTC,"I have Skyla, and in the months since insertion my acne has noticeably increased along my jawline and cheeks, where it had become pretty much nonexistent on Depo - but YMMV. I wish I had been proactive enough to ask for spironolactone ahead of time."
birthcontrol,3dh09o,ichakura,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"Has it increased enough to make you think about removing it? Like is it still worth it? I'm heading off to college, so I hope with having this IUD I will not have to find a way to remove it out there."
birthcontrol,3dh09o,FitnessNurse2015,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:48 2015 UTC,"I haven't considered removing it because the Skyla has been an improvement for me over Depo. The acne is just one unfortunate side effect, and overall, it's definitely worth it! I'm hoping the acne will subside over time as my body adjusts or that it'll improve with an adjusted skincare routine. It isn't enough acne to make me embarrassed in public, it's just enough of an increase that I notice and feel irritated by it. I also had moderate acne as a teenager, so predisposition might be a factor in what I've experienced."
birthcontrol,3dh09o,FitnessNurse2015,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, thank you! I think my body adjusted after the BCPs, and my acne got better on that, so hopefully it will with this, too! It's so nice to know that it does not always cause terrible acne. I had and continue to have moderate acne, so hopefully my experience will be similar to yours. I'm getting it tomorrow afternoon. Fingers crossed it'll be like one of the positive outcomes I've heard!"
birthcontrol,3dh09o,FitnessNurse2015,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:43 2015 UTC,Best of luck with your insertion! :)
birthcontrol,3dh09o,FitnessNurse2015,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:26 2015 UTC,I never had acne before the mirena. Now its a constant thing. Getting it removed tomorrow!
birthcontrol,3dguh2,gissyspangler,2,Thu Jul 16 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, you start it just like you would any other pack. Why did you think you needed to start this one differently?"
birthcontrol,3dguh2,itsme234,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:08:23 2015 UTC,Thank you
birthcontrol,3dguh2,Spookyookie,0,Thu Jul 16 20:14:59 2015 UTC,"My guess is that you're fine! As long as you've been taking your pills regularly (be they from a 21 pack or a 28 pack) and haven't skipped any of the necessary ""active"" pills, the switch should be fine."
birthcontrol,3dguh2,mundabit,0,Thu Jul 16 05:15:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, you did that correctly.  Now just make sure you read the instructions from your new pills so you understand how to keep taking them correctly.   By the sound of it your old brand had 21 pills and you took 7 days break from pills. But this new brand has 28 pills, 21 will be one colour and there will be 7 of another colour, You take these 7 pills when you would normally be taking 7 days break."
birthcontrol,3dfeov,lyoshas,2,Wed Jul 15 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily with sex drive directly. I'm about 9 weeks out and get a dull to moderate ache on one side following sex. That has deterred me a few times from having sex or taking things into my own hands, so to speak."
birthcontrol,3dfeov,orangeisgood,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:38:45 2015 UTC,"In addition to the responses you may get here, this is a really popular topic in /r/childfree. You can search the posts (usually one a day or so) or ask there, or both!"
birthcontrol,3dfeov,Caelestia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:29:04 2015 UTC,No personal experience but a vasectomy shouldn't affect sex drive because you don't stop making and using the hormones that control it. The only thing that sometimes changes is that your body notices you don't get rid of sperm anymore and might start killing sperm on its own. Meaning if attempting a reversal after a long time you might still be fairly infertile.
birthcontrol,3dfeov,Themehmeh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"There are claims that Vasgel, the lower risk, reversible option, might be available by 2016.   So if your worried maybe you should hold out for a different option."
birthcontrol,3deryz,addywoot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:28:30 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to find it, what's the other form that is only approved outside the U.S.?   I think it's silicone, and the inserts look like grains of rice?   It's an alternative to Essure but it wasn't approved because IIRC it infringed on Essures patent.     Maybe that can come back."
