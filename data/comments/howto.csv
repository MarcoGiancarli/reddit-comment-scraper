If you're doing it with a physical card it's even easier as you can easily keep track of where you're up to.

The first 7 digits indicate institution data and the last 9 digits indicate account data. It may not be your account number as you know it but it contains the information to point your institution to the right place e.g. I have three accounts with the same credit union. One account is 6 digits and the others are 7. The algorithm adds a preceding digit though I don't know it's purpose for this equation.

If you train it, it will grow and if you neglect it, it will shrink.  When someone tells me there name, I pay attention now and focus and try my hardest not to forget.  Instead of writing numbers down I try to memorize them. I try to use my short term recall a lot more. I need to get groceries. I write them down but then try to memorize the list. The more I do these things the better I get at them and the better my overall memory feels. The less I do them and the less I rely on my memory the worse it gets. Memorize channel numbers, licensee plate numbers, social security, driver licensee. Memorize lyrics. It all seems to help. A word you can't spell correctly? Don't accept it. I think this a big one. Don't accept things that you feel you should be able to do/know. Tell yourself it is unacceptable. Affect/effect? just spend a few minutes learning the difference and then later try recalling the difference. Do this for a few days and 1 you learned something new and 2 you improve your memory.

I don't know much about screen capture, but after that, you'll need a way to record audio. Your screen capture software should record game sound, but you'll probably want to record your voice separately. For that I recommend Audacity.   Audacity is free, it's a small program, it'll let you record just about forever, and it has a ton of settings to tweak.   After you have your audio and video, you'll need to join them up using a video editor. Microsoft movie maker is not one of these. There are tons of products like this on the market, and unfortunately, the good ones aren't free.   You could look around and try to find a free one that you like working in, but they're usually free for a reason. If you have questions, or if you need support, there's a chance that you just won't find help.   Sony Vegas, Final Cut Pro, the Adobe suite... They can be expensive, but you'll have those methods of getting help, and they're put together in a way that makes working on a project easier. This software will probably be your biggest investment.   For a mic, audio quality absolutely does matter, sometimes more than video quality. I can't watch videos with bad vocal quality, but if the audio sounds good, I could watch Starcraft 1 all damn day long, and that game looks like a tragedy nowadays. Same reason that speakers on the radio can sound so good- there's nothing to look at so it had better sound good.   Audio technology has gotten a lot cheaper recently. The best and the cheapest microphone that I've seen has been the Blue yeti. Should run you about $100 if it's not on sale. It's USB too so you don't have to worry about interfaces or pre-amps.

If possible, try to think about what you say before you say it. If that means you say nothing and it's super awkward, say nothing. It's better than undermining.   Is your ""joke"" actually a thinly veiled insult at someone else's expense? Don't say it.   Are there jokes you could make that uplay their success? That highlight their strengths?  Depending on the context, you might be downplaying because of insecurity/jealousy. Examine your life. Do you undermine about the same types of things? Career, education, finances? Could you improve your life in these areas? Stay busy with that?  If you can't stop yourself from undermining, maybe you could figure out what it is you undermine about and then try to balance it with some compliments.

I mean, someone who is negative about every choice you make? Sure, cut ties, burn that bridge and move on with your life - toxic is toxic and I'm kind of disappointed that she doesn't mention that outright as an option. I praise anyone for being direct and confronting the issue since it's harder for me that a lot of other things. I'd rather help most of my friends move a refrigerator into your 4th floor apartment without an elevator than talk about subtle emotional queues with them. But it reaches a point where cutting those ties is the best approach. Just like there are lots of fish in the sea for love, friendships are similar. Seriously, I'm not going to keep playing games and working to accommodate someone else who isn't making the same effort towards me after I directly talk with them about it.   And just the other day is a great example of the other part. I saw a group of kids and 2 of them were arguing about whose fault it was that 1 of them got hurt (nothing serious, he just feel down onto some rocks and got a bruise). 1 of them said ""I got hurt cause you told me I'd get hurt and you always are wrong and mean so I didn't listen!"" Myself and several adults in the area all looked at each other confused by that logic. Sometimes, the person on the sidelines saying ""don't juggle with chainsaws"" might be right.

howto,3dhqby,LeOneLeggedLovely,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:18:10 2015 UTC,"This is an issue I've encountered many times.   I'm a bit of a sneaker freak and particularly fond of many older styles that haven't been in production since I was a little kid. The issue I have with this is the factory glue tends to dry out and lose it's adhesive properties over time. This leads to the soles separating themselves from the body of the shoe.  I see a few posters have mentioned shoe-goo, but I don't recommend it. I prefer to use Barge Cement or e6000 adhesives.   What you'll want to do is remove the sole completely if possible. Then go over the two sections with some acetone on a rag and try to remove as much of the factory glue as you can to prep the shoe for re-adhesion. Once the two halves are prepped, take a medium width brush and apply the adhesive of your choice to the sole. This is where most people mess up. You don't need heaping globs of adhesive to stick something together. The most IMPORTANT thing to do is apply it thinly.  When it's applied too thick, you actually run a much greater risk of the bond coming undone. Once you have applied the adhesive re-attach the sole to the body of the shoe. I've tried c-clamps, but found the best method for holding the sole in place while it cures is stuffing the shoe with towels, socks or old T-Shirts and then wrapping rubber bands around the shoe.   Keep in mind, all the shoes I've done this to were unworn DS/NOS (dead stock/new old stock). So I'm used to working with very clean and uniform surfaces to begin with, but I think this process will be very helpful worn out shoes as well."

With a good hour spent once and then maintenance once a week you can have a finish that looks good for days of normal wear.  Having refinished boots that went on exercises in the sands of South Carolina, which strip the finish just like hitting it with sandpaper, an oven and attention to detail are the best way to put a really good finish on shoes that are stripped this badly.

howto,3dfhb2,poetryslam,31,Wed Jul 15 21:23:31 2015 UTC,"A good shoe shine will make those look brand new.  I'm not a shine guy myself, but Larry the shoe guy fixes me up for $5 plus tip.  He starts with a water/vinegar mixture which neutralizes any salts in the leather (so he says... salts from road/snow cleaning or from sweaty feet).  Then he goes in with some leather conditioning lotion to keep the leather soft and supple.  This gets rubbed on with a soft cloth.  After that he hits it with the polish (black kiwi shoe polish).   The polish should fill minor scratches.  Then he buffs with to a high luster.  The shoes will look brand new for awhile.    It does look like you've lost a lot of the color though.  If you really want them to be ""new"" though you can have someone strip the polish, re-dye the leather, and then polish.  I had Larry do this to my wife's boots that she bought while studying abroad in Italy as an undergrad.  He charged me $40 and they seriously look like brand new boots.  Most shoe repair or leather repair shops should be able to handle this.    A final bit of advice from Larry - ""the best time to get a polish is immediately after buying a new pair, if not sooner.""  The polish will actually protect the shoe and if you keep them polished they should last longer, the polish will take the abuse, and you won't lose the dye like the ones in your picture."

Alternatively, get a soft foam block from a craft store and use a level object like a 2x4 to press it into the wall with force until you capture the engraving.  Then take plaster and basically dribble it in a thin layer over the foam until you have a firm surface that you are satisfied with.    Modelling clay.  The type that hardens on its own.  Without the air surface area it will take a while to harden.  Releasing agent again... then press it into the space and let it harden.  You may see some deformity.

She's always on an emotional roller coaster, I've made some mistakes in the past, but I'm always the bad guy. Always. She's always the one to blow up, and its never just mildly annoyed or sorta upset. It goes from a 1.5 to 11 fucking million out of 10 on the anger scale in about two seconds. I can't talk to her about what I would like in our relationship because that just skips the step to 1.5. When things are good things are great, we laugh and play and have a great time, but then a switch is flipped and its doom and gloom and divorce. Hell, I asked her what we should do for my 30th birthday and what did she say? Get separated. I love her so much, if I didn't I would have been gone a long, long time ago. I just don't know if I can put up with this anymore. She doesn't want to get help, the last councillor we saw she hated, and doesn't want to go see anyone else.   I just want her to get better... I know the real her is still inside, I see it peek out every so often. I just don't know what to do... Tonight I finally had enough and said I was leaving... Packed my bags, but couldn't bring them to the car... I'm still at home....  Made a longer rant in /r/depression"

But I completely understand that everyone has their breaking point where it's just not worth the emotional toll it costs you every day.  If you haven't already have her talk to a doctor and get something prescribed to help the depression, seek counseling so she can talk about the things that are bothering her.

howto,3da0uo,Oh_FuFu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:51:13 2015 UTC,"My situation is not exactly like yours, but we've been going through a rough patch due to serious past trauma on her end. The one thing I've found through all of this, and indeed, it's the only reason I'm still with her, is that I owe it to myself to not rely on her to make me happy. We 'separated' by moving to opposite ends of the house. (She fought me tooth and nail for this to not happen.) I started counseling on my own, for my own problems, with the explicit goal to overcome the fear of leaving. (She fought me tooth and nail for this to not happen as well.) I did both, I was drawn to it, guided almost. I'm not sure why my thoughts led me there, but it was the absolutely best move I could have made.  In the process, not only did I learn a LOT about myself but how I think, what MY demons were, and what I really needed help with. This allowed us to become less entangled and start breathing for ourselves. I'm not saying that you have demons or faults, but I honestly believe that there are not too many people who really understand themselves, and even fewer who can realize that they've tied their own happiness into someone else or that they don't need someone else's permission to be happy. That's a bad way to be.   We finally started 'calming' down, and she started seeing that I was serious about taking care of my own stuff, she began counseling for her own issues, as well as a joint counselor for us. We've started taking steps towards things being 'right' with both of us, although we have plenty of challenges ahead. But, I firmly believe that had we not found our own space and learned to live independent of one another, we would have not made it even this far. The growth that we've managed as individuals is helping tremendously as a couple.   Anyhow, I've gotten off track. TL:DR; Take care of yourself. Find a counselor to help YOU with this. Learn about yourself, find out what makes you tick and how to better yourself. Don't do it for her, do it for you.   Feel free to PM me if you just want to chat or vent."

The space allowed us to let go of some bad juju and gain some positive vibes for ourselves. Even so, yes, it did come at a price for the relationship. Fortunately, while we did take a couple steps back, we were (are?) both on a much more solid foundation for it.  One thing I would do differently is to be much more thorough communicating my intentions regarding the 'separation'. It might have made it a bit easier for both of us knowing the 'why' behind the thought.

You can put in your location to find how well solar will work in your area on many websites. However, most residential systems are 2-4 kW.  A quick google search found a 6kw wind turbine for $22,000.  I'm sure yours will be considerably cheaper but also not as powerful. A very important aspect will be mounting it quite high and remaining stable.   The Excel 6 is most often installed on a guyed-lattice tower, which is available in heights of 18m (60ft) to 49m (160ft).   At 120volts you'd need a 50amp motor to create 6kilowatts. so your ~15amp treadmill motor would not be sufficient to make 6kw.  The battery you'd need run $5-20k  A 5kw home would need about 42 new car batteries so a 6kw would need about 51 multiplied by $174 gets you $8874. You'd be better off buying one."

Frankly, no a treadmill motor will likely not work.  You have to remember that a turbine rated for XX watts will likely never reach it's full output potential.  For example, if you get a 3hp treadmill motor this only translates to 2.25kw acting as a motor, each motor will act differently when used as a generator.  Surely not enough to power a house.  Where are you located?  What are the wind patterns like?  How consistent is the wind?  Once you have wind data you can calculate the size of the turbine you need, taking into account the betz limit and your individual turbines efficiency.

And how you are going to do this is depending on weather or not you are connecting this to your house or to the local power grid in addition to your house. If you are not connecting this to the local grid, then you will need a component to set the frequency. If you connect this to the local grid, the frequency should set itself to whatever the grid is run at(50Hz or 60Hz most likely), but then you are dependent on it having a constant load, or will turn in to a motor.  So lots of things to consider.  EDIT, also. If you are using batteries you need a rectifier/inverter depending on spesifications."

Stirl while letting it cook without burning. When you feel like it will burn if you leave it much longer the garlic or onion starts turning brown or when it smells like something's burning, add two almost-full cups of water (you can boil it beforehand, but it's not needed) (if you smell burning, Put some 1 teaspoon of salt in, and wait for the water to start boiling. Place the pot lid with a slight 1/2 inch opening and let the rice cook for exactly 7 minutes. This is the key! 7 minutes of boiling. No more, no less.

If you search V30 or V40 hair, on ebay, you will find hairdressers hydrogen peroxide. I'm unsure of their actual procedure, but I think they just soaked it.  Safety: High conc. hydrogen peroxide will burn you. You won't feel it instantly, but about 15 mins later you'll feel sharp pain and a section of your skin will be white and hard. This will fall off after a few weeks. Wear safety goggles and gloves, closed toe shoes, and jeans and long sleeves. Optionally use a jacket as a lab coat.  Contact with rust or any iron salt will cause violent decomposition. It would be best if you could remove the wood/chain, but if you can't, test another piece of wood to make sure it doesn't get damaged.

Looks like a cup would be plenty for your piece.   Dip a corner of a cleaning cloth in it and wipe down the piece with pressure and don't miss any spots (I don't think the solution would harm the wood or glue on the ends but maybe check that).   Use a dry corner to wipe down and buff. Repeat as needed.   A very small amount of mineral oil and a cotton swab will shine it up but oil will soak in over time and may darken.

howto,3cuay7,illuxion,36,Fri Jul 10 21:32:23 2015 UTC,"It's an LCDI plug, more than likely a portable air conditioner. I can find replacement GFCI plugs, but not any LCDI.  Here's an entire LCDI harness but you're need to take the unit completely apart or risk a splice. Don't bypass this plug with a standard plug, if you bypass that plug and the house burns down, your insurance might be a pain.  You could also contact the manufacturer to see what you can do.     It really scares me so many people blindly suggesting to bypass the LCDI."
howto,3cuay7,illuxion,3,Fri Jul 10 23:23:49 2015 UTC,Yeah its from a portable ac unit i own
howto,3cuay7,illuxion,3,Fri Jul 10 23:25:53 2015 UTC,are those lcdi harness universal to replace or manufacture specific?
howto,3cuay7,illuxion,6,Fri Jul 10 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"The mechanism should be universal, but the inside connectors may vary.  A problem with home AC is they pull a ton of current fairly constantly and the wires get warm.  There have been many instances of the jacket melting and catching fire.  LCDI goes open when there is the slightest leakage between the shield and conductors.  I believe they also have overcurrent protection."
howto,3cuay7,illuxion,2,Sat Jul 11 00:06:08 2015 UTC,after i fix this.. is there a way to test the outlet before i use the ac again?
howto,3cuay7,Drone30389,3,Sat Jul 11 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"If you replaced the outlet and the plug, plug it in then press the test button.  The test button creates a leakage condition and if it pops it's good to go."

You really have two options depending on how DIY you want to get.    Purchase a new OEM harness, tear the unit apart and install it yourself. This should be a lot easier than it looks but if you're not used to repairing things, it could be tricky.  That's like a 20$ bill.  Alternatively call a mechanical repair service and have an HVAC professional do it for you. This is probably 20 for the harness 30 for the labor, 30 for the call 80$.    I wouldn't recommend calling an electrician because the call fee is going to be a bit higher but if you want extra security I'm sure whoever comes out would be more than glad to take a peek at your new wall outlet and make sure it's all G2G."
howto,3cuay7,CodeandOptics,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:56:11 2015 UTC,The reason you can find LCDI harnesses but not plugs is because the leakage detection mesh runs down the entire length of the cable.
howto,3cuay7,sirzack92,5,Tue Jul 14 10:33:09 2015 UTC,"Edit: Please ignore my entire reply. Upvote /u/illuxion's response instead.  Well then, I suppose if you're 100% certain the outlet was the problem, you could probably just cut off that plug and replace it with a new one.  Something like this should be available from a home depot or similar.   Try and find something that's rated for a full 15 amps though. That's a heavy duty plug, you won't just be able to grab any old plug off an old lamp and expect it not to melt.  You're also going to want to know which pin which wire goes to. There's likely white, black, and green wires inside that plug. You'll want to be very sure you connect the right wires to the right pins. Searching for NEMA-15 wiring will get you some helpful pictures."
howto,3cuay7,Awesomebox5000,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:44:38 2015 UTC,old house and when i checked the outlet after i saw this i noticed the outlet has frayed wires and was all falling off the outlet box etc.. and i belive the ground wire wasnt even attached.  so we then replaced everything in the outlet box
howto,3cuay7,1h8fulkat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:08:19 2015 UTC,yeah we didnt test/check all the outlets when we first moved in.. so when summer rolled around and we needed a little extra ac in the one room we bought the unit and plugged it in..  we only use it at night time and then all of a sudden we noticed this and then when inspected the outlet and wires.
howto,3cuay7,denrayr,4,Sat Jul 11 00:10:29 2015 UTC,What is this for? It be better to just order the cord from the manufacturer and install it. Reusing this doesn't seem safe. If it happens again it's the device (A/C?)

You don't have to know everything, you just have to know enough to solve your current problem... and then the next problem... and then the one after that. As for a specific strategy for solving problems with code, first conceptualize the real world problem you're trying to solve before you even begin to think about coding the solution. Once you have a thorough understanding of what you want to do, it's often as easy as Googling around to get an answer (e.g. ""how to smooth out a data set in r""). If you can't find any hits on your exact problems, try searching for related problems instead.

Then go through the programs installed on your computer and delete any weird or out of place programs, if you have any questions about a program use a different computer to look up what it is and whether or not its safe. Then look into chrome/firefox and see what extensions are installed, more than likely the virus will still be there, but you can disable it, and then you stop getting the pop ups. Thats how I do it, it isn't perfect but it gets the job done. I am writing this up right before I have to go to my awful job, if anything was unclear or you need more help let me know, I'll be around late tonight."

howto,3cci6n,HawaiianPunchDrunk,3,Mon Jul 6 23:19:49 2015 UTC,"You are getting mixed answers here because the term 'mixing' refers to a few different aspects of the digital music world.   Mixing is done by DJs. They take already made songs and mix them together to play to people. This means that there are no gaps between each song. As HawaiianPunchDrunk pointed out, Virtual DJ and Traktor are good places to start if you mean this type of mixing. Mixing is also the term used to describe what people who actually create the songs do to get all of the different synths / drums / instruments to 'fit' into their track. This is so that you can hear every instrument clearly. MpVpRb's advice is pretty solid if this is what you are looking for. Music production may also be what you mean. This is when you create a song. This is what HawaiianPunchDrunk's Lifehacker Link will help you with."

Sriracha is great, but the heat is overpowering for some people. Short of doing a J.

Likewise, some people consider sriracha to be the vanilla ice cream of the hot sauce world, on the same level of interesting as white bread. This is a fix for that, too.

howto,3c9jl0,Red_TomAto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"What you'll need to do is first rough the surface so the epoxy has good surface area to adhere to. Apply some epoxy to the surface, put down fiberglass sheet over the area (slightly oversize it) making sure everything is in contact, then soak the fiberglass with more epoxy. Make sure to use a brush or roller to remove any air, the cloth needs to be completely saturated for this to really work. If thickness I needed, repeat the above steps with additional cloth (minus initial sanding), and squeeze out excess epoxy, you want as tight bond as possible between the sheets.  Also for epoxy recommendation, I don't have a specific brand, but make sure you get something that is not quick set and something not hygroscopic since it's for a boat.  Good luck! Edit: screw hole. If you don't need threads, just drill the hole after everything is cured. If you need threads, someone mentioned using inserts, though that will get a little tricky without some type of mold or backing to position/orient it during cure. Or you can epoxy in the insert after everything is cured."
howto,3c9jl0,Red_TomAto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"Woah, let me back up. I guess I was misunderstanding what fiberglass sheets actually are...  I was picturing an actual sheet 12x12, 12x24, whatever. Cutting that to size then epoxy it onto the dash. Would this work with an ABS plastic sheet?  Now the fiberglass you're mentioning... would that still be the sheet I'm describing plus some type of fiberglass repair kit? I've seen and used the cloth method you're describing but that stuff gave me a difficult time in a much wider area."
howto,3c9jl0,Red_TomAto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:13:03 2015 UTC,"Ooh, you were thinking of a already cured fiberglass panel and gluing that on? If the area will allow for that, sure that could work too. Though it will not be as strong, cannot have any contours, and may not look as good.  The method I was describing would be saturating dry cloth with epoxy. You don't have to buy a repair kit since you can buy epoxy and a roll of fiberglass separately relatively cheaply. If the area of repair isn't too big, this method is not too bad. Or you can even combine these two methods, and glue the panel of plastic using fiberglass cloth and epoxy so it has some strength at the joint, while not having to build a while new section with dry cloth.  Did that clarify what I was describing?"
howto,3c9jl0,Red_TomAto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was imagining just overlapping it, epoxy together, reinforce at the joint. I like the idea of combining the two.  Can you link me the fiberglass you had in mind? Guess I've never seen it outside of a repair kit. That seems like a tough project, would I be doing multiple sheets until it was thick enough then?

That front dash panel is basically just leather on the front side and behind it is where the fiberglass is supposed to be.

Also, it's probably a good idea to throw a pinch of cream of tarter when you first combine the eggs with the sugar, or do it in a copper bowl, to neutralize a little bit of the eggy flavor unless you're into it.

Find a raised place to put the dish, fill it with water and put the rock in it to give he birds something to land on.  The rock also helps keep the dish from blowing off or flipping over.

howto,3btkwh,Valheol,0,Thu Jul 2 01:15:30 2015 UTC,"I just want to mention those supplies are costly. There's very little difference buying boxes and take from Walmart (except price). USPS does offer convenient flat rate boxes though, and they're generally well priced.  Remember when choosing a box, it should be suitable for shipping. That is, a good box should be thick and sturdy unless it's packed tightly with foam peanuts. Don't pack with paper, it's not going to help much. And fill all empty space with lacking material.   Boxes usually split along the edges, so when you take it up, take each edge of the box (12) as well as taping down the top and bottom flaps. This is a bit overkill, but good for very large and heavy boxes.   Use their calculator on the USPS site to figure out the cost--estimate your package size and weight at first. If the flat rate option is cheaper, do that!"

howto,3boomf,FluentInTypo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:10:36 2015 UTC,I'm not using expensive salts for making spice rubs or flavored salt mixes. I'm using common inexpensive sea salt I get in bulk.

Because from what I know of infusing salt, and looking up a few articles on it, basically you put whatever flavoring you want in with the salt and shake it up and let it sit...and that's basically it. In order to actually get flavor INTO the salt you'd have to like push the molecules of the pepper or whatever you want to flavor it with into the salt molecules. which if that's the case something like that i suppose would be worth paying 15 bucks a lb for. but honestly I'd still rather just save some money and mix it up myself. I'm pretty sure the end result is going to be good enough. salt with heat and the flavor of the pepper."

I.e. instead of adding https://www.ss.youtube.com/watch?v=cZiDjA6Vzx0, add a l https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZiDjA6Vzx0, (L for local) where that uses a local server. Named bookmarks can do that. (same thing as right-click-on-searchbox and then ""add a bookmark for a search"" does)  I have been messing with luakit, and do feel that a lot of the stuff i wrote might feel at home in a local server/proxy aswel, giving more flexibility in what browser people use in combination. Perhaps even one could think of making a browser as a really thin layer that passes some key/mouse events, next to the data itself a proxy, and then writing a featured proxy for it. (proxies can also be layered in sequence) (Note: for some applications the proxy might have to open up the https, and then serve it to the browser, which then needs to accept that. I.e. the guard for https being signed correctly by a correct key would be the proxy.)"

If you think it's dropping too much and will overflow the box then make a small hole in the bottom of the flower box and run a wick from that over the balcony edge.    sorry, I just actually read all of what you wrote, you need to collect it at source,.Right well the first thing to do is to force the drips to always drip from the same place. I would try a taping a sheet of heavy plastic to the bottom of the unit so that it encloses all the drip zones, then put one hole only in the plastic somewhere so that now all the accumulated drips only have one spot to come from.

howto,3bl8wd,sirlearnsalot,6,Tue Jun 30 06:14:27 2015 UTC,"Really depends on how far you want to go.    If you REALLY want to make it look new, you're going to want to remove the hardware first.  Look around on the metal parts and pull out the nails securing them.  Once you've done this and removed the hardware from the wood, sand the whole damn thing down with rough sandpaper to take off the finish since it's in pretty tough shape.  Once you've done this, get wood putty and fill in any cracks, holes, or gouges (except the nailholes left by the hardware.)  Let that dry, sand it down with rough again, and then get sand over and over with progressively higher grit sandpaper until the surface is velvety smooth wood, preferably without the water rings there... you might have to take the wood down pretty far there, so that might not be possible.  Now your wood is ready for stain or varnish.  Stain will bring out the natural grain of the wood but will not protect it and will need a sealing coat, varnish will darken the wood and protect it.    The process is a little different between the two; with varnish you need to seal it first with a sanding sealer, but essentially they're the same thing.  Find a color you like, do multiple light coats, and let it dry.  If you're staining, seal now, if you're varnishing, don't worry about it.  Most important is using the same base, so if you stain using an oil based stain, use an oil based sealant, and the same goes for water based.  Once you've got your shit varnished or stained, reattach the hardware in the holes that you left previously.  Done and done.  This does not account for fixing the broken foot, but unless you have the missing piece, you're gonna have trouble with that save carving a new piece.  If you have the missing piece, wood glue and filler will be important.  The alternative is shabby chic.  Distress that motherfucker.  Sandpaper, steel wool, maybe hot pots and pans... whatever you want.  Just make it LOOK intentional and you could make it work... you really should fix the cracks and gouges on the tabletop IMO, but do your thing.  If you go the shabby chic route, just make sure it's cleaned up well so that it's not dust and such making it look shitty.  Good luck!"
howto,3bl8wd,warfrogs,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:00:19 2015 UTC,My first wood working project I ever did was restoring something like this.  If I could give one word of advice to save you a butt load of time and effort: buy/rent/borrow a sander. Things go so much faster if you have one. I would suggest a random orbital bit sander.  You will still have to sand the details by hand but on the flat parts it is totally worth it

howto,3bl8wd,narddawg314,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:24:05 2015 UTC,"do you want wood or paint as the finished product?  if it's wood, then sanding is not the first step.. you'll need some varnish/paint stripper.  from there you can sand it to get the last bits off and clean up the wood.  Also from there you can get a better idea of the grain and condition of the wood. If you just want to paint it, then a light sanding followed by one coat of primer and then whatever paint color you want to use."

howto,3bl8wd,wmass,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"have fun sanding all of that off.  coming from someone that restores old wood furniture.  use a chemical stripper if you want to remove the current finish.  also, too much sanding will absolutely change the shape of the edges.  A flat table is good for sanding, but anything with that many joints will take you weeks to sand down to a reworkable and even surface.  edit:  sand the wood after you use the chemical stripper and have removed as much of the existing varnish as possible.  sand paper gets gummed up quickly when used on varnish"

So if you were somewhere remote without power, it would be perfect for taking notes and jotting down odd thoughts, and it had graph paper on one side of each page in case you needed to sketch stuff. So if you need a rugged notebook for anything at all, get a little field notebook.

Just random shit.  A random example is I was playing some game, I don't remember which, maybe Fallout, where you had to like hack a computer or something. Writing down each grid of characters and systematically crossing them out would be a pain on the phone.

I also found myself jotting down silly things I overheard people say (I was going to bars a lot at the time, so lots of drunken conversations) that I would never have bothered to put into my phone, like ""some things I just gotta have hot... like hot dogs."" Someone else might have types that into a note taking app on their phone, but I just found it more reasonable to write it down real quick.

Paper there's no ""opt out"" to find berried 9 levels deep in some account settings.  No confusing privacy ""agreements"" where you agree not to sue and they agree to do whatever the fuck they want with your their data.  Sure, your paper notes might not be encrypted but at least you know about such details.  Does your app only use encrypted transport?  Often the only way to know is to sniff packets.  Does the app vendor even care enough to do penetration testing?  There are so many questions that are trivial to answer about paper.  Arguably, it could be easier to secure a paper notebook than it is to assess the security of an app.  If you lose your notebook it probably won't be sold/distributed untold numbers of hackers.  Heck there's a decent chance that it will be absentmindedly swept up into the trash.  Heck, the odds are probably better that no one with malicious intent will get a hold of it.  Aside from that psycho ex girlfriend there's probably no one trying to get into it.  If you have data on something connected to the Internet, someone IS trying to get into it.

Would some rubber seal strip work at the bottom of the door?  If I was going to build a lip like you describe I would pour it separately into a form, like a half of pipe or one made of wood, keeping it nice and level and then turn it upside down on the floor and just dynabolt it to the floor and either use something for a gasket or seal the edges with some kind of filler.  If it wasn't going to be driven over, I would likely just use a L shaped section of aluminium, some weather stripping between the floor and the section, and dynabolt it to the floor.  I'm far from experienced, but I don't think it's necessary to bond concrete to concrete permanently to seal up the door.

howto,3bfj1m,mingy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:29:30 2015 UTC,"In my internet searches I've learned that garage doors are not waterproof.  The house I live in is pretty old, but mainly it looks like the seal at the bottom is not flush-enough to keep out water in big storms.  Unless I build a large overhang over the garage door, it's exposed to the pouring rainstorms.  I just had a guy slant the concrete to a downward slope so water can't collect.  But just yesterday I discovered I can put a rubber seal on the floor, which will contact the rubber seal on the garage door, and hopefully make a more secure closure.  As U/gvifaq42 suggested: http://www.homedepot.com/p/Tsunami-Seal-16-ft-Black-Garage-Door-Threshold-Kit-53016/202199784  So I'm going to try that next, before I resort to the concrete lip."

I generally don't like most western geometry at all.  There's no face convexing, there's too much upsweep towards the tip, it's not very thin behind the edge, there's really no distal taper to speak of, and the steel is just a plain mid-soft german steel that you have to hone every 2 minutes.

howto,3b7l54,by-the-numbers,2,Sat Jun 27 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"Python is an awesome language. Certainly my favorite at the moment.  That being said, if you intend to use an Excel VBA -> Python add-in in a work environment, keep in mind the following facts:  1) Excel VBA has a ridiculously massive install base, and is supported by Microsoft itself. Excel/Python add-ins, not so much.  2) There's a very significant Excel VBA community online, and most any question you could have has been answered on the web.  3) Microsoft may, at any time, introduce features that could break any particular Excel VBA / Python add-in, and whether or not you'll be able to get support from the add-in's creator -- assuming the add-in creator is even still around -- is a toss-up. Native VBA code, otoh, is much more reliable.  4) Microsoft is switching from VBA to HTML / CSS / Javascript for future versions of Excel. Whether or not it's worthwhile to invest in Excel Python scripts that rely on a third-party add-in is your call.  Yes, VBA is 20+ years old, which is more than ancient in the tech world. But it can accomplish just about anything you need done within Excel / Office, which is what it's designed for, and anyone that can program their way out of a box ought to be able to learn VBA rather quickly.  Also, FWIW, if those interns can't figure out VBA, they're unlikely to accomplish much more in Python."

While they do have simple syntax, they're both extremely limited in the scope of what they can do.  Instead you should use INDEX/MATCH, or even better, OFFSET/MATCH. OFFSET/MATCH does everything any of the other three things listed do, plus a lot more - while its syntax can seem a bit more complicated at first, it actually allows you a ton more syntax both with what you're able to do and also with how you set up your data tables in the first place.  I don't have a good link about OFFSET/MATCH, but the basic syntax is:  OFFSET(point of origin,MATCH(what to look up,where to look it up in,0 (to get an exact match)),MATCH(what to look up,where to look it up in,0 (to get an exact match)))   So you can MATCH one lookup value within one axis of your data table and and a second lookup value witihn the other axis of your data table (or replace one of the MATCH's with 0 to only slide along one axis).  Here's an article that talks about why you should use INDEX/MATCH instead of VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP, but OFFSET/MATCH is far better even than INDEX/MATCH."

And additionally, I feel that if you're using VLOOKUP then you might not realize a lot of the things that you could do if you were using OFFSET/MATCH, just because you aren't as familiar with the latter."

Regardless of what uses you could find for these things, they are worthless unless we apply worth. Value is subjective and therefor a cryptocurrency can exist and have value because it is given value. I'm not sure why you are failing to understand this.  That said, the fact that oil can be burned for heat means the demand for oil would never be completely evaporated unless there was an alternative... and if there was a more cost effective alternative available to everyone then the value of oil would be nil and no one would buy it. Your ""you could still burn it to keep your house warm"" is pointless because it would have been replaced with something else. Demand is driven by subjective value of a commodity. If there is no demand, the value is low to the point of being cost prohibitive to provide the service/product."

howto,3b2w3u,BLOODY_ANAL_VOMIT,0,Thu Jun 25 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"A valueless commodity has no use because something else of value fills its spot. The average US civilian doesn't have an infrastructure to burn oil for household heat and therefore that is not a use for most of the populous. Compound this with, again, the hypothetical ""loss of complete value,"" you run into the issue of ""more cost effective replacement.""  Demand = value. As long as there are those who use oil to heat their house, there is demand which gives it an intrinsic value. You're trying to have your cake and eat it too. It doesn't work that way.  You have made it clear that you're anti-cryptocurrency, and that's fine. You have a right to feel that way. The problem is that you are unwilling to actually have an adult discourse regarding the topic. Your understanding of what applies value to something vs. usability seems to be tenuous. As long as something has a use, it has a value to someone and therefore is not valueless.  A cryptocurrency functions on the same principle of something like gold or diamonds or any other commodity that is not necessary for human life to sustain. Oil is not necessary for human life, for example. We could very well get along without oil or gold or diamonds if we chose to do so (and found replacements for them in the things we use them for, which we are doing as a species).  If people want bitcoin: That is demand and applies an intrinsic value to bitcoin. It has no value to you? That's fine. Gold means nothing to me. I don't care about gold. It has no value to me. It's also worthless to me as an individual because I don't use it for anything... but that doesn't mean it doesn't have value and use for others. And those values and uses are arbitrary.  Your attempt to separate the value of an object (which has nothing to do with the price of the object) and the use of an object is where your understanding of the concept falls short. As long as there is a use for something there is value in that thing. As for bitcoin: the use is to provide a decentralized currency that is not controlled by a government. It has a use. It's just not a use that you may need to fulfill, just like gold may be valuable (or oil, since you seem to like that) to you but not me.  Edit: I'm not sure why you're being downvoted.

""Network marketing,"" advocates will try and claim that only pyramids or chain letters with no product are considered criminal or illegitimate.  The truth, however, is that network marketing tends to appeal to extremely ugly materialists who are entirely happy to get money any way they can.  My family were in Amway for eleven years; it destroyed my parents' marriage, and lost us the family home.  Amway got very sophisticated in the end, because the revenue generation was split among three sources.  The membership fee as this infographic states, but there were two others; the Sales and Marketing Plan, (the product catalogue, which had ludicrously expensive prices) and motivational books and audio tapes, which were basically used as a form of mind control to both keep people in the business, and motivate them to be more productive.  I was a teenager when we were in Amway, but the thing that first caused me to suspect illegitimacy, even back then, was how expensive the products were.  I didn't have a degree in economics, but I couldn't figure out why anyone would sell products that were so much more expensive than their competitors, and the standard answers about concentration and efficiency also made no sense and felt like lies.  Pretty much any time you see the phrase, ""network marketing,"" it means you're actually looking at a pyramid scheme, but generally they will spread revenue generation over a few different sources, as described above, in order to avoid the pyramid accusation.  More than anything else, however, the initial joining fee is the truly classic signature of a pyramid.  That should only be given to non-commercial organisations; never commercial ones."

howto,3ayztj,tohuw,15,Wed Jun 24 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"Right? This is such useless straw to someone feeling overwhelmed at all the choices.  The real best advice is just: pick one.  I cut my teeth on HyperTalk. You know how useful HyperTalk is today? Immensely, because the syntax is totally secondary to the discipline, and I've taken that discipline to learn what I need now."
howto,3ayztj,Primnu,3,Wed Jun 24 21:30:09 2015 UTC,"I've never understood why infographics like this suggest C++ for 3D games (to people learning programming).  It might be better than C# in whatever way, but if you're just learning then it'd be best to start with a game engine like Unity which is built on C++ but allows you to program in C# or JS.  Throwing C++ at someone who hasn't even got their feet wet in programming is just asking for them to run away."
howto,3ayztj,andrejevas,0,Wed Jun 24 22:43:40 2015 UTC,"Dunno about Ruby, but Python is definitely adult Legos with infinite pieces."
howto,3ayztj,DustlessCheeto,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:25:45 2015 UTC,"I may have worded my comment wrong. I agree with the python and Legos comparison but just felt like it was more author bias being show. Legos are often associated with logic and planning ahead to build something useful(seen some pretty cool stuff made out of Legos, even for adults) Whereas Play-Doh is just something children smash together or at best make rudimentary sculptures out of. Plus when it comes down to it on a basic level aren't ruby and python pretty interchangeable for MOST projects?"

howto,3ayztj,tohuw,11,Thu Jun 25 05:24:55 2015 UTC,"Yes. Ruby is not Play-Doh, Python is not Legos. That doesn't mean anything.  Also, if you want to work for Microsoft, C# is definitely the mainstream, but they do have other developers on staff. Similarly, telling people to learn Java because they ""hate Microsoft"" is just silly advice.  The right way to do it is tell people to learn whatever seems interesting at the time. It's about discipline, not the ultimate language to unlock all of life's happiness."
howto,3ayztj,ffollett,2,Wed Jun 24 22:54:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I went through the flow chart and wound up at the lego vs. playdough question and just died laughing.  Granted, I prefer legos over play dough and python over ruby.  Still a ridiculous question."

A lot of engineering work is built around C and a lot of scripting languages (Labview, MATLAB, PSPICE, VBA, etc).   Honestly, I think one of the best ways to learn is to get a basic Arduino board and start programming the tutorials and upwards using sample code and available libraries. There are dozens of student projects that you can use the board once you complete the basics."

howto,3ayztj,MpVpRb,2,Wed Jun 24 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"How to learn programming from scratch   Pick ANY reasonable language at random  ""Reasonable"" means mainstream, procedural and fairly easy to learn, with good tools. It helps to have a good teacher  My first programming class was in 1972, in ALGOL, on a mainframe, with punch cards  BASIC was invented long ago as a simplified teaching language. It was minimal and fairly easy to learn. Visual Basic is a confusing mashup of old BASIC with some object oriented stuff bolted on  Today, python might be a good choice, or java, or even C  A bad choice would be lisp or haskel or any other ""weird"" or experimental language  After learning the first one, the second is easier, and the third even easier. After a while, picking up a new language is no big deal (unless it's one of the weird ones, in that case you will have to work on it)  If you want to do embedded systems or want to really understand how computers work, you will need to learn assembly and C  If you want to do web stuff, you will need Java and Javascript  After becoming familiar with how programming works, if you are curious, go ahead and learn lisp, haskel or any of the new experimental languages"

We use C/C++ in school but I'm looking to learn either Python or Java. Trouble is, I dunno where I'm gunna end up in the industry. I like mobile, but I also like the physical aspects of working with hardware.   Switching languages is like trying to turn a train, though.

You can remove most of it by acid washing the stone but it will return over time unless all the salt is out of the mortar. To acid wash: first purchase hydrochloric acid, muriatic acid from a masonry supply store. Then mix it in a brand new bucket ten parts water one part acid. Be sure to not breath any fumes, if your water pressure is high it will foam up and mist, you don't want to breath that. Then thoroughly soak the area you are going to wash with hose water. Take a long handled broom with plastic bristles(available at your masonry supply store) dip it in the bucket and vigorously scrub a 1 sq foot area. You will notice a white foam on the joints. Keep dipping and scrubbing for no longer than five min. DONT LET THE ACID SiT on the stone throughly rinse with hose water. If that doesn't work up the acid content to no more than 3 in ten and repeat the process. Just remember you can't be too careful and keep your hose handy. Good luck."

howto,3arenz,SolidVapor,15,Mon Jun 22 22:25:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If I hypothetically ever did this in the past, I would have transferred the liquid out of the cookpot and into cheap Tupperware that was put in the freezer for about half an hour. The butter would solidify on top, chip a hole and drain the water back into the pot and reheat with the ganja. Then, repeat. Discard water when butter no longer rises to the top in the freezer. Then heat all the butter together just to the point of melting, and mix it up really well. And of course, store it in the freezer for longevity."

howto,3arenz,hoiyoiyoi,3,Tue Jun 23 02:20:43 2015 UTC,Yes. This! You never burn or cook your butter.   You need to keep it warm enough to leach THC but not to burn the plant matter or brown the butter. The longer the better!

howto,3arenz,kryptobs2000,3,Tue Jun 23 16:59:47 2015 UTC,THC is fat or alcohol soluble. It wont bind with water.
howto,3arenz,myfivelies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"I know, that's why we use it. You mix the water, butter, and cannabis in a pot. The butter is not miscible w/water, the pot is not dissolvable in water. Therefore you can apply as much heat as you want and it will never get above 212f/100C until the water evaporates. Since cannabinoids are not water soluble, but they are fat soluble, they all get absorbed into the butter. Once you're done you put it in the fridge and your budder seperates and solidifies. Scoop it out or strain the water away and you're left with relatively pure and clean cannabutter."

howto,3arenz,Kittyisgood,12,Mon Jun 22 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"If you use a vaporizer, save the compost. Once you have an ounce of compost, set up a double boiler (pot with an inch of water in it, place larger bowl on top of pot) and put 1.5 cups of coconut oil into the bowl. Turn on the burner to bring the water in the pot to a boil. Once it boils, turn the burner on low. After the coconut oil melts, add the compost and stir. Give it a stir every 30 minutes or so and allow it to do its thing for about 2-3 hours. Make sure you watch the water level in the pot and add water if it gets low. After 2-3 hours turn it off and leave it until the next day. Repeat the heating & stirring process for 3 days. After the 3rd day, allow the oil to cool for a couple of hours before you strain it (don't wanna burn yourself). Now using a baking sifter lined with cheese cloth, strain the compost from the oil.  You now have (just under) 1.5 cups of coconut oil to use in cookies, brownies, or anything else you use oil to make, and it's infused with all the cannabinoids you can handle. It's cost effective because you've already vaporized the THC off the buds, but through the process of heating the compost in oil, you activate and transfer the other cannabinoids to your coconut oil. It's a beautiful thing :)"

howto,3arenz,Kittyisgood,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:06:13 2015 UTC,You can also put the stuff in a little cheesecloth bag if you have one handy. Fancy kitchens have them for bay leaves and stuff like that. It reduces the amount of large plant matter you have to strain out.

howto,3arenz,nwv,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:02:40 2015 UTC,"A few years back I had purchased a couple of cannabis cook books from a head shop. They suggested a 3 day cycle. I can't remember exactly, but it's something about the heating and cooling that activates all the cannabinoids. I've done a 1 day cycle (got impatient and figured it would be the same either way) and found that the oil was much weaker. With the 3 day cycle oil I usually make chocolate chip cookies. They're average size, approximately 2.5"" in diameter. I cut them into 4 and each quarter is basically one dose. I typically eat a half of a cookie if I'm just chillin at home, gets me nice and baked. Eat a whole cookie and I'm fused to the couch.  The one day cycle oil cookies were weaker. I'm had to eat 3/4 to a whole one to feel nice and baked. So in my experience, it's worth it to let it do its thing for 3 days. But maybe other people have had a different experience. You kinda have to figure out what works for you."

When you smoke weed, the THCA molecule loses its carboxylic group (COOH) in the form of water vapor and carbon dioxide and becomes THC. Long story short, THCA becomes THC and your cannabis becomes psychoactive. This process is called decarboxylation or decarbing.  LY5 it converts THCA to yummy TCH"

My wife made up a batch using regular cooking oil instead of butter.  We have a friend who grows, that gave us a bag full of the throwaway plant material.  My wife left it simmering on the stove for about 5 hours, then used pantyhose to separate the oil.  We bought a glass jar with a rubber top just for storing the oil and keep it in the fridge.  Holy crap is that stuff strong!!!  She made brownies one day, and I licked the spoon.  You know, maybe 1/2 teaspoon of batter that's left?  I was fucked up for 14 hours.  You simple cannot eat even half a brownie.  Finally got through that batch and she made a new pan of brownies for me, using only 1/4 of the canna oil and the rest was plain oil...  STILL pretty potent, but I can eat about 1/4 of a brownie now and sleep through the night (which was the original intent of this experiment)."

The flies are attracted to the vinegar and the soap will break the surface tension of the water, effectively drowning the flies.

Sometimes you can bring home fruit flies from produce purchased from the grocery store.  Bananas and onions have been the worst for me. Hope this helps!"

LMMS is a free software which can be used for making ""beats"".  Reaper is a free advanced DAW software, with an optional $60 no-ad version.  The free version just has a ""buy us!"" thing that pops up when you open the program, but has no fewer features than the paid version.  Very powerful, but not intuitive for beginners.  You'll need to watch some videos, which are available online on youtube, Coursera, edX, etc.  Audacity is a simple audio editor, good for cutting tracks and changing tempos and some other stuff.

howto,39xu9x,That_red_guy,3,Mon Jun 15 22:16:18 2015 UTC,What is a fence and a miter gauge?
howto,39xu9x,Nebakanezzer,13,Mon Jun 15 23:33:13 2015 UTC,"A table saw can be a very safe piece of equipment when used properly. However when cutting, the user needs to have the wood resting against something to ensure a straight and stable path to the blade. It's not a tool that you can simply pushed a piece of wood against like a band saw, sander or a joiner.   The two most common guides are the fence and the mitre gauge.   The fence is the long piece that runs front to back.  It moves left and right and provides a stable guide to push a piece of wood against while sliding it towards the blade.   The mitre gauge sits in one of two groves and slides forward and back.  It can be adjusted to cut an angle or to cut straight. Generally when performing a cut off, a mitre gauge is the proper tool.   When cutting sheet of plywood or something similar, the mitre gauge would be too small and unwieldy, while the fence provides a perfect wall to support the sheet.    In this video, he uses the fence and a gauge to cut a narrow and long piece of wood to the correct length, but pushes it through with the mitre gauge.  The risk is that the piece of wood binds between the fence and the blade. This results in a sudden, violent kick back.  Honestly, it happens faster than you can get scared.  Ask me how I know:|  The safer way to use a fence as a measurement guide is to have a spacer attached to the fence for the first few inches. This allows a solid and accurate measurement to the blade, but also allows the wood somewhere to kick off to instead of binding into your unsuspecting face."

If you host it on your PC, you will have to open it up on your computer to world; set up DNS to point to your computer as a host; and still get a domain, unless you plan on getting to your computer through the computer's IP (note: IPs can change, so you'd have to get a static IP from your provider; it would be easier to get a server and go through the server name, if you don't want to get a domain [look at AWS; they make it easy]). Might need help/corrections for this statement You would have to get a program like sendmail (linux) that can send/receive emails. Sendmail is usually just a send-through for something like PHP to send an email with appropriate headers and info that the receiving email server can understand. E.g.: Sendmail will send a gmail account the required information that gmail needs to understand it's getting a valid email. Things I'm not sure on: how do you actually maintain a DB of the emails sent and received.  To make sure your site is secure, SSL certs would be a good investment. Again, go to AWS. They provide servers, routing (for DNS and all that good stuff), certs, databases, pretty much whatever you need. Those are probably programs you can get to take care of that, but it still needs to be configured to determine what spam mail is, as each server has it's own rules to determine what spam is. Virus filters... no idea.  Google stuff, honestly. You can find most information online. Most of the programs you need are free, so you can probably keep costs low. The biggest costs, I think, will be your server costs, and even those can be like 20 bucks a month.   Honestly, it's cool definitely a cool and challenging project, but, honestly, it's a lot of work and a lot of risk, especially if you plan on using it as an actual server, past your project. There's a lot of stuff you gotta consider, concerning security, making sure mail is delivered properly, maintaining users/emails/threads, etc. There's a lot of stuff to consider, so definitely think it through before popping into this.

If you own the property, there should be blueprints and plans from when you bought the house which will show this. It's not entirely necessary, but could save a costly mistake.  As far as leveling it goes, there are a lot of ways to do it. If you're wondering how far down to dig, I'd assume it's as deep as the lowest point in your yard (you want to level it, right?) Most ground is hard clay after only a few inches, so it may not be easy to dig up. The easiest but most manual tool for leveling is a tamper. It's literally a square of iron you stamp on the ground to compact it. You can use stake and string to get the slope right.   However. You don't want a perfectly level lawn! The ground should slope away from your home so that water doesn't leak in. The typical ratio is 1/4"" drop for every foot.  (Oh! I absolutely love YouTube. You can find instructional videos for almost everything on there. It's always worth searching it for how to stuff!)"

Once the dirt is mostly clear find a good way to compress the loose dirt (called tamping)- for as small a plot, simply walking over it shouldnt take too long. Add fill dirt and repeat the tamping proceedure until satisfied. Use a dirt rake to sculpt the surface."
howto,39ylxh,pancakesareyummy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:46:23 2015 UTC,"additionally to the other comments I want to say:  The thickness of the barklayer should be between 2 and 3 inches thick, and if you don't remove those 2-3 inches from your garden it will roll everywhere when it's windy or when a dog walks over it. So...turn your garden/yard into a 3"" deep hole. You can use the earth to fill out the space left from removing the plants, if you want to remove them. I personally would just rearrange them. After rearranging I suggest to walk over the area a few times to see where the earth needs to be compressed a bit more (where you sink in the most). You usually use a tamper for that, alternatively you can jump a few times on it or fill a bucked with earth and drop it on the ground. You'll feel muscles you didn't knew you had.  I wouldn't put down any plastic. Bark stops weed from growing, quite efficiently actually, just go over it with a hoe every few weeks to make it look nice. You have to add the half the Bark every year because it disintegrates with time, just so you know that there are costs to keep it in shape. Alternatively you could buy gravel but then you do need plastic or it will simply sink into the earth over time.  For leveling: The tips here are valid but another way to keep the level is to dig 2 wooden bars into opposing sides of the yard (||). The upper side of the bar will be highest point in future yard. Scrap a third bar (-) over the others, so it forms a ""H"". If your ground is soft enough you don't even need a shovel, but I doubt that's the case. It's still a good way to keep the level over a relative large area. The most commonly used method is a string spanned over the work area.  About the materials you'll need: in Germany you can buy everything you need in the nearest Hardware store, I assume it's the same where you live."

howto,39vu2m,Jarvicious,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:09:46 2015 UTC,Depends on your battery and the demands you are placing on it. If your draw is going to be substantial such as with a high drain lithium ion battery over a low ohm load you definitely would not want to use a spring contact. The less resistance you place between your battery and the target the better. Also they tend to get hot under high current and you should avoid anything hot making contact with a li-mn battery. In these circumstances I recommend spring plate brass contacts. Be warned these can lose their springiness if they get too hot for too long. Keep this in mind while soldering.   If you are talking about AA batteries or similar you don't have to worry about any of that. You can buy a battery sled from amazon or any electronic parts store.  Do not solder directly to a battery. Batteries and high heat are NOT friends.
howto,39vu2m,clickwir,3,Wed Jun 17 05:09:55 2015 UTC,"A 40 watt iron will work a lot faster and will actually help to protect components as you won't need to heat joints for as long.

howto,39t0nj,MurgleMcGurgle,7,Sun Jun 14 20:23:40 2015 UTC,If you open up the drill the battery will probably be in the handle and there is a good chance it will have labeling on it telling you what kind it is. If there is a part number on it a google search will probably give you a link to getting a direct replacement.   If not it should at least have electrical specs and if you post those here it'll be easier to point you in the right direction.  There's probably nothing you can do about the safety but if you take pictures of the opened up drill it may give us more info.
howto,39t0nj,MurgleMcGurgle,7,Sun Jun 14 16:52:22 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/sdM2VNr  Looks like it just uses a chain of 4 600mAh rechargeable AA. Not sure if I can find more powerful batteries to fit it without frying the electronics, but maybe. It doesn't indicate when fully charged and the flashlight on the front is broke so the actual drill is all I'm worried about."
howto,39t0nj,Zer0Goblin,5,Sun Jun 14 17:19:25 2015 UTC,As long as they are standard 1.5v 1.2v AA batteries you should be fine replacing them with something that has larger capacity (measured in mAh). Something like this should do. Just make sure you wire the new ones in exactly the same order the current ones are in.   Unfortunately it looks like the safety feature is part of the circuitry so there's not much you can do there.
howto,39t0nj,JoeyBigtimes,4,Sun Jun 14 17:28:09 2015 UTC,As long as I can put higher capacity batteries in it I'm not worried about being able to use it plugged in. Odd that they designed it that way though...  Thanks for the help! :)
howto,39t0nj,kerklein2,5,Sun Jun 14 17:33:15 2015 UTC,Rechargeable batteries are 1.2v each.  That's why the motor is stamped with 4.8v (1.2 X 4). Measure the length and diameter to be sure the size.  You can get rechargeable batteries with soldering tabs to make the job easier. A higher mAh which will increase use time but will not damage anything (like putting a bigger gas tank in a car won't make it go faster).
howto,39t0nj,nayrrrrrr,4,Sun Jun 14 19:10:32 2015 UTC,"As far as using it while plugged in, I'm assuming you want to use the wall plug to power the screwdriver while the batteries are dead. I'd bet the wall power is a wall wart with a barrel connector. In that case the max amperage will most likely be too low to supply power to the screwdriver's motor. If you say, wired the wall power directly to the batteries connectors, bypassing the cutoff circuitry, you'd burn out the wall power supply."

I wouldn't worry too much about the brand since knowing that probably wont help you get replacement parts. (the manufacturer likely did not intend for this to be repaired so parts wont be sold by the OEM)   then get a actual drill for doing anything you wouldn't do with a small screwdriver, like taking apart electronics. if you try and use this for anything even close to power, like putting screws into wood, you will wear it out really fast. then you wont have a memento from your dad."

As others said there is the drill and chisel method, stacking 3 thin boards with the middle piece shorter to create a slot. You could also do it with trim pieces but it would be harder to make nice and probably a less robust.  You can also run a circular saw or table saw into the side of the board, if you are uncomfortable with this you should watch some reputable youtube videos on how to do it safely or create a sliding jig for the table saw to do it."

But I'm guessing you don't have tools like a router and drill press otherwise you would not be asking this question.

It's extremely easy to do, you can do it with a drill and some dowel, and should be strong enough to hold up shot glasses.   If you need more instruction just reply to this with any questions you have, but it's pretty straight forward! Drill at least two (more is better) holes halfway into the cabinet in a horizontal line. Drill equally spaced holes in the end of your shelf. Cut small pieces of dowel the same size as your holes, fill each hole (in the shed and cabinet side) with glue, and push your shelf into place.   Of course, this also requires building the cabinet around the shelves!"

American Italian food seems more garlic laden than the food my Italian girlfriend's parents make. They are Northern Italian and would never dream of leaving the garlic in once they've cooked with it (i.e. cook the whole clove in a sauce and fish it out). Where is your family from, how Americanized are they, and what is their stance on garlic?"
howto,39bu87,stranrar,2,Thu Jun 11 15:25:00 2015 UTC,"We're from the Abruzzo region of Italy (around the lower calf area, if you look at Italy as a boot). I'm 3rd generation, so my great grandparents grew up in Italy and moved here as young adults. My grandparents spent most of their lives splitting time between America and Italy. So I guess you could say we're 50/50 on the Americanization.   We cook it the same way you mentioned. Whole garlic cloves cooked down into the sauce, then removed along the simmering process so as not to burn the garlic or over-power the flavors.   The true key to the classic Italian marinara is two-fold: Fry off meatballs and italian sausage first, and cook them the rest of the way in the sauce. This doesn't create a bolognese (ground meat in sauce), just completes the flavors of both the meatballs and the sauce. Second, let that sauce simmer all day long. Start it at 8AM, leave it to simmer on low heat until dinner at 6pm. The longer it simmers, the better it tastes (within reason). Plus you get to enjoy a lovely Sunday with the house smelling of marinara and meatballs. I love being Italian."
howto,39bu87,Nfc24,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:55:34 2015 UTC,So going light on the garlic might not be a region-specific thing.

Long answer:  Wood laminate floor is a very inexpensive way to get a hardwood look for a fraction of the cost, but that comes with a drawback.  It is essentially never going to look any better than when it's first installed.  Imagine if you will, you print out a picture of wood grain on a piece of paper from your printer.  Now imagine taking that paper and putting it onto a polyboard.  Stick on a layer or two of coating, and that's essentially what wood laminate is.  Once that print rips, scratches, or tears.... that's it.  There's no fixing it.  Now, all hope is not necessarily lost.  You might be able to color match a stain or wax that will minimize the scratching.

howto,398o2u,cynicalfly,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:57:18 2015 UTC,So how should I phrase it considering she's a beginner at this stuff?
howto,398o2u,cynicalfly,8,Wed Jun 10 02:08:40 2015 UTC,"She's 11. She'll understand pretty much everything you tell her.  How would you explain consent to your friend? You can find out resources on consent in /r/bdsmcommunity --they are very good at explaining things although there is stuff all over the web. In terms of mental state, you can talk about oxytocin, you can talk about how people bond when they do intimate actions and that sex can be a very intimate act--but sometimes people are not prepared for that bonding feeling and it can make their life difficult.  Something else to note: without sex ed she might be ashamed of her body--many women are--so she needs to know it's not her fault if she's viewed sexually as she gets older.   I remember when I was younger that I also didn't have information about how my periods were connected with sex and pregnancy (never tell her that she can't get pregnant on her period, that's not true). You should explain that they are natural and not something that needs to be hidden from men or women with great shame. It's a part of life. Explain why they happen.   Absolutely teach her about birth control in all its forms. And make sure she knows that she can have her mother leave the room during doctor's visits so she can talk privately with the doctor. The doctor is not allowed to share that information with the parent.  She might have questions that sex hurts. Explain that healthy sex doesn't hurt most of the time and if there are issues than those are questions to give to doctors and to talk out very bluntly with her sexual partner. Make sure she knows that sex is NOT something a man does to a women but an action they do together. The phrase ""a man gets on top of a woman"" really can lead to some toxic thoughts ala Clan of the Cave Bear.  Additionally, don't assume your sister is straight. Sexuality changes and many people have sex or encounters with people of their same sex.   TBH, this is a question that's better to ask in /r/TwoXChromosomes"

Like the other guy/girl said, take photos of absolutely everything the day you move in but BEFORE you move your stuff in.  There are companies you can pay to do this professionally, (inventory clerks), but if you are diligent your camera phone will be fine.  Pricing and value are relevant to your area and tastes.  Your best bet is to book as many viewings as you can across a spectrum of rent prices.     I would recommend viewing something firstly at the top/bottom end or just outside of your budget to get a  feel of what your 'premium'/ 'scumbag' apartment looks like; this will let you know what a decent price is when you find something you like.     Do you need to be close to a particular area? proximity to town center? good public transport routes?  free parking?  These are all questions you can answer before even booking a viewing for the place and should help narrow your search.  I hope this helped; I signed for a new apartment with a friend 2 weeks ago and we move on the 19th so I feel your frustration and excitement.   Good luck!"

The last thing you want is to be left paying the bill for someone else.  Having a set of ""house rules"" agreed in writing before you sign anything (who cleans what, when; who can use what, when; who can stay over - and for how long) is worth doing as well. At the very least cover cleaning, and use of the bathroom/kitchens, as that's where most of the fights start."
howto,393h1k,MckinneyCole,12,Tue Jun 9 00:02:57 2015 UTC,Thermal paper will turn blackish if exposed to heat and/or UV radiation. You'd need to put it behind a low-e coated glass plate separated from the glass and insulated from the heat of the wall too. Styrofoam backing on the frame might help. This will be a bit of a raised frame on a wall and perfect behind a basement bar if you've got a basement with a below grade wall behind the bar.

howto,390wwu,Bill_Board,11,Mon Jun 8 13:08:17 2015 UTC,"For pictures, drill a very small hole and use picture hanger hooks. For an acoustic guitar, I'd trust plastic butterfly anchors and a decent hook from the hardware store. Keep in mind that plaster walls have wood lath behind them for structure, so your anchor will likely overlap the wood.  For a TV, you need to find a stud (Would suggest this for an electric guitar also). Drill a 1/8"" hole where you want to hang the tv. Cut a wire coat hanger around 20-24"" long and bend into a U shape with the middle part 2-4"" wide and both ends exactly the same length. Insert the U into the hole so that the outside end hangs straight down, so you know the inside end is in exactly the same location inside the wall. Rotate until the wire touches the stud. Mark the end of the wire; this is one stud. I suggest repeating to find the next stud. It's probably around 16-24"" from this one, but houses old enough to have plaster in my area are also old enough to be pre-code.  Cut a board to fit your tv mounting holes and span the studs, screw it into the studs, screw the mount to the board."

I've found lots of it that crumbles when touched. I've done home renovation in and around Boston and in Maine. There's a lot of it up here, but... it's a bit scary.  K&T in itself it may be fine, but when you get people doing all sorts of circuit extensions--even just changing out switches & outlets--the wiring can get tugged around or knocked in the wall. Cable company installers are often totally untrained. They cause problems. If the insulation is bad, it can fall right off. Then the electrons leak out and fill the attic, causing some houses to emit a faint blue glow at night. In extreme situations, the house may fill with electrons and float away.  With increasing demands from more & different appliances, it's not uncommon for people to upgrade their house to 200, or even 400 amp service!

howto,390wwu,neuromonkey,3,Tue Jun 9 21:30:35 2015 UTC,"Another tip on finding a stud is to knock on the areas to the immediate right and left of an electrical outlet or other utility plate. A hollow sound is no stud, a dense sound is a stud.  If the location of your studs put your TV in an awkward place that isn't ideal for mounting, you can also look into Drywall Anchors. They're generally plastic (or metal for heavy loads) ""plugs"" that can take a screw but grip to the back side of the drywall for added leverage. You'll drill an eraser sized hole in the wall and insert the anchor which will fit very snugly.  self drilling anchors. They're usually metal and look like MONSTER wood screws. and are designed to be used in walls of your type.Each size of anchor has accompanying screws of the appropriate size. I'd advise against anchors if you're renting a place. When you move out, you'll need to knock them into the wall or pull them out with needle nose pliers  to patch over the gap they leave behind.  Also for your guitar, you can purchase wall mount kits for these, or maybe even just using some command stick-on hooks at the right angles and nesting the hourglass shape portion of the body within them. Or the tuning knobs if your guitar is acoustic and they face out from the neck. http://www.rawiriblundell.com/?p=987 you may want to check here. Worth a shot and no tools necessary."

There are metal self drilling anchors that can be applied to plaster that should get the job done.   I edited the comment above. Thanks for catching that.

Knock on the wall until you find the place where it is not hollow, IE the wooden strut and drill into that and hang your things."
howto,390wwu,MrHiym,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"Just curious, how would you get plaster on a wall without lath? I mean, we have drywall here which is a plasterlike substance (probably reinforced, not sure) between heavy paper facings, but we wouldn't usually call that a plaster wall."

howto,390wwu,AngryData,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:57:23 2015 UTC,"The TV has to have a stud, if there isn't a stud in the right location you are going to have to cut a hole in the plaster and put in some wood support attached to the studs. Then plaster and screw tv into support.  The pictures, they sell picture hangers and all sorts of plaster and drywall anchors. If it is plaster, you may or may not want your guitar on it. It lasts a long time, but when it fails it can fail in big pieces and drop your guitar. If it is drywall, just use a drywall anchor and make sure you install it correctly."

howto,390wwu,Bcron,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:17:39 2015 UTC,"For the TV:  If it's plaster & lathe, use a neodymium magnet with a hole in it like one of these, and tie a string of really thin dental floss to it (about 4 feet long), and dangle it like a pendulum against the wall, it'll swing back and forth until it finds a nail used to hold the lathe to the stud.  Then swing it a little higher, and a little higher, and you should have that magnet sticking on that same part of the wall, all the way up, to get confirmation that it's a stud.  You don't need to drill or anything if it's plaster & lathe, since the magnet will find the nails.  Also, don't go off of one nail, you gotta go all the way up to make sure that it's the nails used to put the lathe to the stud, and not just nails in the lathe.  If you are planning on doing a low voltage run in your wall with your TV you can do this too!  Take the nearest electrical panel cover off.  Hit the circuit breaker, check to see power is cut.  Take a butter knife, stab it in the wall between the junction box and the wall, and wiggle it, you should feel the stud on either the left or the right.  Drill a hole on the side of the stud you wanna hang the TV (you'll need to find the second stud, so use the first stud for the right and drill to the left and vice versa), then stick a tape measure in that hole, and poke for the stud.  Pull tape measure out and check.  Should be 16"" but you'll want confirmation.  16"" from center of stud to center (Edit: Usually.  If your house is older than like the 50's, it might have different spacing, like 24"" or something wonky, so tape measure to check).  Then use that hole for the low voltage run (it should be behind the TV so it's all good)"

howto,38zka9,dama9ed,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:29:44 2015 UTC,"Read the documentation.  Can easily be done when you have the model number and internet at your fingertips.  Its pretty simple... ya put it in the window with the controls on the inside.  They are engineered to have some degree of balance where the stops are beneath it.  Also helps get the downward angle thats necessary to allow condensation to drip out of the unit.  TL;DR - look up the manual for the unit you want, this is first and foremost.  Will likely tell you weight/installation directions/etc  Aaaaand,  one ou have it,  you put it in the window. Create a brace if you want, shouldnt be necessary unless called for in that sweet sweet documentation."
howto,38zka9,BeerStuffz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:30:02 2015 UTC,"They are heavier than a box fan for sure. You will open the window, balance the AC unit in place and close window onto the unit. As long as the window stays closed as far as it can go, the AC unit can not fall out. You will use either L brackets or a piece of wood to hold the window in place and prevent it from somehow opening up. Look up installing online. There's surly a bunch of guides. The unit will also come with instructions. It is not difficult."
howto,38zka9,ThreeHolePunch,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:37:02 2015 UTC,"Not hard, but if you are worried about your window falling apart you could always build a little wooden box around the AC unit to spread the contact weight to the box instead of the sill and closed window.  They are very easy to install, but heavier than a fan.  If your house is kinda old or has a poor electrical wiring job it might flip the breakers when the compressor kicks on if it shares a circuit with anything major.  You want to buy something big enough to cool the room you're putting it in.  Otherwise you'll have issues with it.  I had a frigidaire unit for about 4-5 years now, remove it during winter and clean it before putting it back in every year.  Not the GREATEST fit with the window in terms of blocking the heat leaking in around it, but it gets the job done."

You might need a 2x2 screwed to the sill to raise it an inch and a half. Accept pinching a finger rather than dropping the ac out of the window. Go ahead and screw to the double hung window as long as you don't hit the glass.

You could play the same chords and it could be any song so the name of the song is irrelevant.

If you want ""natural"" then get hardwood ply and some matching 1"" iron on edge veneer. (I'd also recommend a router with a flush trim bit.)  If you have access to a friend or community center wood shop, a table saw will make this much more precise.   It's all a bunch of pieces the same width and a bunch of same length for the vertical pieces.  Tools needed at a minimum: Circular Saw (Or hand saw if using pine boards) Jig Saw or Coping Saw Wood Glue (I'd use Tightbond 3 or Gorilla Glue) 90"" Angle ruler (or t-square)  Optional: (But you won't e disappointed) Pocket Screw Jig Drill Table Saw Clothes Iron (if using edge veneer) Razor knife or Router (If using veneer)"

As for making an actual drum, you might search the internet for drum shell manufacturers - many sell just the shell for the customer to do with as they please.

Try to avoid lines with disengaged shoppers- texting on their phone, chatting up the cashier, don't have their cash or card out, or won't assist bagging their items (even at Publix- especially if there's no bagging assistant in your lane).  Also reminds me- if there is no bagging assistant, the line is likely to move slower- sometimes the assistants they hire may actually hinder the speed, so know who's there.  I have a few workers I avoid at my supermarket because of this.  I will go to what, on the surface appears to be the slower lane, and leave faster than if I'd been in the other lane because of them.

Above that, meat typically takes on the flavor of the food the animal eats.

Both had very distinct flavors, particularly the marsh hog.  It definitely had a more earthy taste I can really only attribute to diet.  Similarly I've taken lobster from 4ft deep grass flats and 120ft deep reef dives on the same day.  Both had differing textures and colors.  Taste difference wasn't as noticeable in that instance, but diet and environment lead to differing meat qualities.     There are also several articles on the net about it.  None of the articles are particularly scientific, but all touch on the fact that a healthy animal will taste better than one fed a less than ideal diet. http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/ingredients/article/pig-whiskey http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/will-chicken-thats-fed-lemons-taste-lemons http://www.grassfedrecipes.com/flavor-rx.html  I'm not sure what your experience is with non-store bought meats is, But diet and environment absolutely affect the flavor of the meat.

It is caused by the dimmer design, with LEDs the only effective way to dim most of them is to pulse-width-modulate the power supply, and high frequency square waves are very efficient RFI generators.  Some degree of noise is probably unavoidable without completely changing out the lighting system, but you can put ferrite beads on any and all wires involved in the lighting system, power supply, etc, and maybe reduce the higher frequency harmonics that are most prone to generating RFI."

howto,37zd14,iownadakota,5,Sun May 31 18:24:48 2015 UTC,"Fixing this is hard, even for an expert  The concrete is covered with colored rocks and possibly a pigment, you will need to find rocks and pigment that match  The best approach is to remove the entire section. The white lines break up the uniform surface. If you replace the entire rectangle with something almost right, the lines will distract the eye and make it look OK  Use a diamond saw to cut out the entire section at the white lines, a jackhammer or sledge hammer will be needed to break up the pieces  You will need to make several test pieces to make sure the rocks and pigment match the existing color. Matching concrete and rock color is hard. You can't tell what color it is when wet, you have to wait until it dries. Also, these things weather over time. The typical masonry supplier may not have the exact match, you may have to mix and match from the available stock  Form and pour the replacement concrete, then layer the rocks over the top  Almost anybody can fill the hole with grey patching concrete  But, it takes a real expert to make it look like nothing ever happened  If you have mad skillz and REALLY love a hard challenge, go for it (I would)  If you don't give a fuck, fill it in with non-matching concrete patch, or just leave the hole and tell the story  Or..call an expert"

Exposed aggregate concrete is regular concrete but made with smaller round rocks, you place it just like normal concrete and then spray the surface with a retarder. 12 to 24 hours later you go back and wash the surface with a pressure washer, washing away the surface paste that didn't set, exposing the aggregate (rocks).

The retarder just keeps the very top layer of paste from setting which is then washed off so you can see the rocks. After washing it can then be coloured by a method called acid staining which only colours the surface. The main reason to use an acid stain rather than integral colour (blended throughout the concrete by adding powder or liquid colour to the load in the mixer) is that it's much cheaper but, as you can see in the picture, if the concrete is damaged at all you see the plain grey concrete underneath.

He makes the point of reaching in front of your shoulder, but doesn't touch on how your arm should stay out of the water until it is almost streamlined with your body. A lot of people thinking 'slicing' the water with your hand makes you go faster since you're cutting through the water, but the water drags you back more than air resistance.  Another thing about the stroke. If you watch right here, the swimming brings his arms around instantly, which is wrong. One arm should always be in front of you. Keep one arm reached out until your other arm is about to slap the water again. This is to cut through the water faster."

The decision setting is pretty straight forward. Your source is the drive you want to backup. Your destination is your external drive you want to backup to. Just select the backup profile in the add profile wizard. Later you can modify the profile to be sure the decisions are set to: ""Source overwrites Destination always"" ""Copy file to destination""  And any other options you beneficial.  If you are still wary, just run a simulated run. It will tell you what would have been deleted or copied. Even the running the backup will still present you with a choice to continue after all files are scanned to determine if everything is setup properly."

I LOVE taking the rust off of things - every piece of cast iron in the house is salvaged this way, so I'ma tell you the easy way to do it, and when you do your research, you'll find others suggest the same  thing.  Vinegar.  Go to the grocery store, pick up a few gallons of vinegar for a dollar and a half each.  get a big 'ole bucket that can hold things, or at least one at a time since they're so big - and soak those bad-boys in vinegar for a day and a half.  the rust will sludge right off with a wire brush - minimal elbow grease.  then rinse, immediately dry (I will put things right on the stove after paper-towel dry) and an immediate coating of peanut oil.  Those are great finds, and completely salvageable.  Good luck, feel free to ask me any questions you might have - it's super simple and basic.

I also recommend seasoning the cast iron pot and the dutch oven by wiping the clean iron with a tiny amount flax oil and then placing them in the oven at 500f for 30 min. Reapply once or twice. You can use lard/butter/olive oil but flax is the only oil that truly dried hard.

After removing it from the solution, the vinegar will continue to react with the iron, so it needs to be neutralized with something like oven cleaner or washing soda. Then you dry and season."

In case there are any music students out there, join any ensemble or group you can. Do well and it will show the teachers how committed you are. These are the people you want to impress, they are the select few that make a living in the field.

I always turn off the tv speakers and send audio to be processed by my receiver in order to simplify this, maybe your tv has a similar setting.  I haven't ever tried to send audio and video through the tv from another source (pc).  Oddly though, if I want to play movies from the VUDU or Netflix app on the tv, instead of the ones on my bluray, I have to channel the audio via optical cable to the receiver, otherwise it doesn't go to the receiver via HDMI and I get no sound.

I think that the HDMI ports on the tv only process incoming signals from other devices and don't actually send anything unless the HDMI port is specifically an ""out"" port - I could be wrong about this but that's how it seems to work.  Also, my receiver has a setting section where I had to route the incoming optical connection, from the tv, to optical port #1 that was associated with the ""TV Audio"" receiver function setting.  It's possible that if your tv is receiving audio from another source, via a port on the tv, then it's seen as native TV audio by the receiver and so you have to run the outgoing audio to the receiver by a separate connection (optical or RCA).  Whereas, if you run the computer connection directly to your receiver (if that option is available) then the video will be sent to the tv and the receiver will process the audio without another connection."

Also, make sure its not your breath.  Easy check is to lick the back of your hand, wait 30 seconds then smell it.  If it stinks, your breath will be bad too."
howto,36kexr,Hellman109,5,Wed May 20 08:52:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, OP. Deodorant and cologne only mask a smell which already exists. Antiperspirant products invariably contain some sort of aluminium salts, which affect the production and fermentation of sweat to prevent the production of odour. Make sure your arm-pit perfume is actually an anti-perspirant, otherwise you're going to be subjecting people to the fragrance of your bacterially-exposed fermenting sweat body odours, and co-mingled with the artificial, tacky perfume of deodorant-only body sprays, you're likely to repel others, and even yourself.  In regard to breath, make sure you're flossing daily. Seriously, try sniffing the gunk which is stuck between your teeth on a piece of dental floss, and you'll never assume that brushing alone will cure bad breath. Also brush your tongue, and rinse thoroughly afterwards EVERY DAY. Minimum.  Keeping your bodily fluids diluted is important too, as per /u/Hellman109's advice above. I'd also look into other vitamin or mineral deficiencies you may have, if you follow the above advice to the letter and find no significant improvement."

howto,36kexr,blpsoup,3,Wed May 20 03:54:30 2015 UTC,Check your washer machine. Some high efficiency washers can mold on the inside. The smell from this can be transferred to your clothes and towels. I didn't notice the odor on me till i was out of the house. Hope this helps.
howto,36kexr,tohellwithaname,6,Wed May 20 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"Knowing what kind of odor it is would help.  Do you smell like feces, sweaty armpits, dank balls, musty clothes, bad cheese, garlic or fish ?"
howto,36kexr,geodebug,4,Wed May 20 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"How long do you use a towel after showering before you launder it?  How do you store the towel between showerings?  You can use the same towel for a few days at a time, but if the towel is not hung up to get completely dry between uses, it will get a yucky mildew-y smell that you're then rubbing on your body when you dry off after the next shower.  If it's not your towel, here is some other advice:  It could be your room.  This weekend is a holiday weekend in the US, so if you're in the US you're in luck.   Empty out the entire room of anything soft/fabric - all clothes, bed linens, curtains, etc.  Rugs if it's not a carpet attached to the floor.  Launder ALL of the bed linens and curtains and towels on hot (please read the labels to make sure hot is ok, some things might not want to be washed on hot), launder ALL of your dirty clothes, and if possible hang your clean clothes out doors to air them out in the fresh air.  Make sure you are following all the directions for laundering such as using the right amount of detergent (you might not be using enough).  Wash your floor or vacuum if it's a carpet.  clean all surfaces with a cleaner or with a vinegar solution (recipes for using vinegar for cleaning are easily found online)."

The biggest thing that helps me is changing sheets often, at least once a week. Also, where's your dirty laundry? Is it everywhere? Try keeping it in a closed basket if that's a possible funk-source, or maybe doing more frequent smaller loads."
howto,36kexr,fatklaus,3,Wed May 20 13:15:21 2015 UTC,"Two things: to deodorize your room, use a baking soda based carpet deodorizer. They can be found in the household cleaning department of any grocery store or Walmart. They come in various scents and varieties. Of particular help are the ones that say ""Odor NEUTRALIZER"". Sniff the boxes, find a scent you like, take it home, sprinkle the stuff liberally on your bedroom carpet, wait a few minutes, and vacuum it up. The baking soda absorbs funky odors, and the perfume should last several weeks. Hopefully you like it.   If you think your problem is body odor and nothing suggested here helps, go see your doctor. You may have a serious, or not-so-serious, problem that carries body odor as a symptom. Your odor issue could also be a funny smell in your own nasal passages that only you can smell, which might indicate sinus problems.   Good luck!"

howto,36kexr,ImCrampingYourStyle,1 point,Wed May 20 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"I switched from using aluminum based antiperspirants (which work by clogging your pores) to a natural deodorant that was fragrant free, paraben free and hypoallergenic. I had about a week or two where my body was acclimating but after that, I began to have a neutral smell.   I don't smell bad nor do I smell like Fresh Rainy Meadows or whatever the fuck they call those deodorants.   Some people have a sensitivity to antiperspirants which end up causing more smell than they mask.   I used the Liquid Crystal brand and I really suggest you try it out for a month. It's natural, aluminum free and allows your pores to just do their thing without clogging them up with chemicals.   They do make a couple of lightly scented ones as well, like Lavender.

Here's my initial findings:   I've found that there are sites that sell flooring much cheaper than big-box shops or speciality stores.  Bamboo is (rapidly)  renewable, light, and supposedly really durable.  Order samples; most of the sites I've found online allow for you to order a free selection of flooring samples. They'll send you little squares of it so you can see what it'll look like before pulling the trigger.  Avoid Laminate wood flooring. Recent reports indicate some laminate wood flooring originating out of  China have dangerous levels of formaldehyde ."

Too much crap on the market and I've never seen it look as good as real wood. Sounds like laminate when waking over it.    Vinyl is a decent option in some rooms. Due to budget reasons I once did an entire house in it and it was a good option.    Any more I go for Hardwood above grade though. Engineered gets a lot of good reviews, but it's still just plywood with a pretty top layer to me."
howto,36k3bd,Star-Bellied-Sneech,1 point,Wed May 20 11:45:04 2015 UTC,Sorry I didn't specify earlier: concrete slab on the first floor and just wood on the second. So on grade and above grade.
howto,36k3bd,KurtKronic,1 point,Wed May 20 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"On the second floor where you're laying the floor over a plywood (assuming that's the case) subfloor, you don't need anything under the floor.  It will just tack right into the subfloor assuming it's level and doesn't have any big lips from one board to another.  Once you have the subfloor exposed, make sure it's well nailed (screwed is better) down.  Most squeaky flooring is due to the subflooring rather than the hardwood on top.  That's something that will pay dividends in the long run.  Especially if this is a remodel and you don't know how long the subfloor has been there.    Also make sure you putty any bad gaps/lips between the subflooring.  Like painting a wall, the hardwood on top of the subfloor will reflect what's underneath it.  Make that a nice surface to put your floor on top of.   Finally, absolutely 100% listen to the guy that said let the hardwood acclimate.  That's one of the most absolutely important things you can do.  Definitely do not store it on it's side (lay the boxes flat on the floor in the room).  Leave them there for about 2 weeks before doing the install.  It may not have to be that long, but wood changes size/shape with increased/decreased moisture levels.  This will allow the hardwood to get to the same level as your house where it will remain for the duration.  Subflooring acclimation is usually only important in new construction where the wood has residual moisture in it, so that shouldn't matter much - however if your subfloor is exposed while the hardwood is curing, that won't hurt.    Sorry I can't help on the concrete floor.  I just don't know.  My belief, (take with a grain of salt) is that you will need a subflooring so you don't just lay something over the concrete.  Especially if it's a basement.  Concrete is cold, so you want some insulation between it and the floor.  Also, concrete bleeds water through cracks where there's moisture in the ground.  It's not enough to get the floor 'wet', but it is enough moisture to make the boards expand/contract and it will eventually jack them all up.  You'll see ripples in the floor develop over time.  I think I've seen matting that is water resistant and insulating that go underneath, but I'd have to do some research to point you in the right direction.  The idea is: you're putting an investment into the floors, make sure they are protected from underneath."

howto,36hvwu,graffiti81,3,Tue May 19 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"No one has explained to you why this works. So I'll explain my hypothesis.  It's a bug on Google's end with serving ads. But here's why the bug works. When you full screen a video, it's like the non-full screen YouTube ""pauses"". At best it can match the time in the currently played video, so it's nearly seamless to go from full screen to not. The bug starts working when you switch to a new video while full screened. YouTube in non-full screen gets stuck. It has no idea what to do. Once you exit full screen, non-full screen youtube will navigate to the new video's URL.  I'm not entirely sure of the mechanism, but upon loading this video a second time, the ads are gone. I would wager that the full screen youtube doesn't have a proper ""Ad not watched and not skipped"" signal back to the servers that synchronizes with the non-full screen youtube, or something like that.  Only reason I suspect that cause instead of a limit on how many ads you get shown in Y time (which may only apply if the video was not fully watched (4 second vids) or fully buffered) is because normal refresh hasn't dismissed ads in the few times I played with trying to bypass ads before going back to my regular adblock plus-equipped browser."

There's also a varenyky type that is filled with sour cherries and eaten as a dessert with sugar & sour cream.      One tip I'd like to add is that varenyky are easy to freeze and store.   Many of us won't eat 108 all at once!       Don't boil the varenyky you're not planning to eat, lay them out on a lightly floured styrofoam tray. We save the large trays from hamburgers, chicken thighs, etc.   Lay them out in rows, pop them in the freezer, and stack trays on top of each other too!

First, make sure you keep the light steady and at a constant distance from your eye.   Second, for this to work well, you need to keep your eye closed tight with the the same force for 30-40 seconds. This might sound easy, but it gets difficult to keep your eye shut at the same intensity/amount for that long. Even slight changes in how tight you're closing your eye will affect which colors/wavelengths your eye is exposed to during that time. This isn't ideal because you need your eye to be perceiving only red (not ranging from red to orange to yellow which happened to me the first time I tried).   I tried again, this time using a thin piece of opaque plastic held up to the flashlight. I then lightly closed my eye and held it to my eye. The color stayed consistent the entire time and the end effect was MUCH more noticeable.   P.S. Thanks for the upload! This was really interesting!"

The red that is intensified when the light shines through is supposedly negated. Switching which eye is covered while looking gives you a side by side comparison of the difference in what is seen.

howto,35w98l,Sporktrooper,6,Thu May 14 08:50:57 2015 UTC,"Some armchair engineering: if you load with a magazine, every magazine becomes a point of failure. Every time you swap out a magazine, you're adding an unknown to the aircraft. You don't know when that magazine was last tested, or if it has been sitting in a sandy shed for weeks before coming to you. Loading in this way, the aircraft controls feeding directly. If there's a problem, you'll know about it, because the aircraft is maintained. Repeating that level of detailed work for every magazine in use would be a greater inefficiency. I don't think they're that worried about spending a little fuel with the aircraft at idle.  Besides, this looked like a training exercise or a test of the aircraft (I'm guessing, based on the way it was wandering around the field just off the ground). I'm sure if this were a combat situation the ground crew would be working as fast as they safely could."
howto,35w98l,morkman100,3,Thu May 14 12:52:42 2015 UTC,"I assume he means you slot in the special magazine for reloading then detach and manually connect the next one (instead of reloading each round manually).  Worst case if there is a reloading magazine failure, they would just reload each round manually (which they are doing now).    What's the point of putting these rounds on ammo belt clips if you're just pulling them apart to feed the rounds individually?"
howto,35w98l,Sporktrooper,3,Thu May 14 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"As pointed out in another comment somewhere in the thread, that looked like some kind of feed failure. They kept trying to get it to take it with the belt and it wasn't having it, so they resorted to feeding one at a time.  As magazines go, imagine that failure on a larger scale. With the belts it only affects maybe 10 rounds at a time, but if you have one magazine of 50-300 rounds that fails that's a larger impact."
howto,35w98l,GeneralTomfoolery,2,Thu May 14 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"I was thinking, what if you had some wheel barrow sized machine that would make the individual rounds into like a clip (m1 or like the one they showed with the plastic clasps) and it would be brought upto the helicopters when they landed. That way, you wouldn't need to have the helicopter crimp each round.  Would that work?"
howto,35w98l,Sporktrooper,1 point,Fri May 15 02:41:34 2015 UTC,"That's basically what they're doing already. When the ammo came out of the spam can it was already clipped, but the clips failed to feed. Obviously you'd want to fix that point of failure - I don't know what caused the failure to feed here, but (still armchair here) I'd wager the tolerances for it to work properly are under the millimeter mark.  If you mean to keep the clips in place while feeding to the weapon, rather than to the internal belt, I don't think that would work very well. These fire over 600 rounds a minute. Feeding ten rounds a second with a plastic clip pulling the rounds through the belt would not be ideal. You'd also lose the manual-feed access that the ground crew was using to advance the belt (well, maybe not lose it, but you'd have to dump a clip at a time instead of just one round).  But yeah, putting the spam can in a wheelbarrow or something would make life easier. I don't like lifting cans of small calibre rounds, lifting a can of 30mm would suck ass. They probably have restrictions on what kind of containers they can move while an aircraft is in use, so that's probably why he was schlepping it."

The one case I remember is from a German officer doing something similar with captured fighter pilots.  The one part I remember is the German officer talking to pilots and gaining their trust, he would take the POW's on walks and they would talk about everyday things until the POW was comfortable with them.  Once that was accomplished he would ask questions about the fighter planes and their tracer rounds and why they changed color after an extensive fire fight and the pilot POW said they used red tracers and once the ammo was about to be depleted the tracers would change to white so the pilot would know when to break off and escape.

howto,35scek,dcb720,2,Wed May 13 02:49:27 2015 UTC,"I would argue that it is illuminating. Years ago I was modestly fluent in Spanish as well as English (my native language). But the subtleties of Spanish were challenging for me. One day I was visiting a work site of some Japanese peers in Honduras. One of the Japanese professionals wanted to show me something, but he spoke no english and I spoke no Japanese, but we both had a similar fluency in Spanish. So we were able to engage, but periodically we would come across a concept we could visualize and comprehend in our native language, but it was difficult to get the nuances across into another language which was then interpreted back into each native language.  So this example really is more of a game. It really does help to show kids how difficult it is (without even getting into the difficulty of accurately transcribing the spoken word days, weeks years, after it is original heard or even retold) to accurately take a concept from one language and then try to get the both the vocabulary, the structure, and the inherent symbolism, to cross languages, especially those without a common root."

If the plaster is in a block of any real volume a stronger acid is required. Muriatic acid works very well for removing it from cement, It should never be used on a body part because Muriatic acid is just a dilute sulfuric Hydrochloric acid and will cause severe burns.

howto,35a9no,MCiccosanti,3,Fri May 8 12:43:14 2015 UTC,"First, bats are under a lot of environmental pressure, between the smut nose disease (iirc) and loss of suitable spots to nest. They are far less likely to carry rabies than squirrels or skunks, and they eat TONS of mosquitos every night. They are a great animal and should be considered a ""friend"" rather than ""pest"".  That said, it's better if they don't live in your house.  There is a ton of good information online about bat exclusion, I went through hiring a bat exclusion contractor last year. Yes, they are expensive, but if you get someone who knows what they are doing, it should be worth it.  The tl;dr of it is this: you need to find out where they enter/exit, and make it possible for them to exit but not return. When all the bats have been ""excluded"", it is safe to seal up the holes.  Not all of the bats will leave each night, and there are likely to be young bats that do not leave the nest at all until the end of the season (late summer/early fall).  Exclusion specialists will find the entry/exit holes and install a one-way ""valve"", that allows the bats to leave but that the bats can not re-enter. They should also find any other possible entry/egress spots, and close them up as well.  The specialist will immediately be able to identify potential trouble spots, and will also be able to immediately point out where they enter/exit."

howto,35a9no,grateful_ted,2,Fri May 8 16:50:48 2015 UTC,If you know where they are entering/exiting you want to hang a net or  sheet over it. Make sure all other areas are sealed. This will allow the bats to get out but not get back in. Trapping a bat in your attic will increase the likelyhood they will find a way into your living space as a way to GTFO.

howto,35a9no,grateful_ted,2,Fri May 8 14:40:23 2015 UTC,Actually i would recommend an old pillow case. Just cut open the closed side. Then you want to attach it (use your imagination e.g. duct tape) around the opening so that the only way they would be able to get back in is through the bottom of the pillow case (because they won't be able to...bats can get out but they can't get back in). Leave it on their for a few days and then seal that bad boy up. If you can get some screws to suck those boards together that would be ideal. Then caulk it. If not caulk it with something that's made for wider gaps (ask someone at your local hardware store). Don't cheap out on the caulking either. Cheap caulking gets brittle and will crack.

My drill press is a cheap bench top model.  It doesn't run in reverse (as required for a left-handed bit), but I can put a twist in the drive belt which reverses the drill chuck.  I wouldn't want to run that way long because the belt is rubbing against itself at the twist.  I recently got a thing that makes any drill work sort of like a drill press.

I know the guy in the video was just trying out his gun but I would try for a 50% overlap on the passes. That would be for either spray gun. It's a good way to avoid tiger stripes.

Replace the mortar, and seal the bricks with a couple layers of clear sealant. Even though the bricks now look all ripped up.  Sandblasting also works, but does even more damage to the strength and appearance of a brick wall.  So will paint strippers, even the gel kind.  The problem is that bricks are heat-fired, which creates a very hard face on them, which protects their soft inner core from penetrating moisture. Remove that hard face, and your bricks will crumble over the coming few winters as water gets inside them and freezes. They crack open and leak and the wall will eventually fail.  It's the same problem mountains have with water.  But -- given the slightly porous surface of bricks -- you have to strip their hard face away completely to get all signs of paint off the brick. You can't win this thing.  This freezing of water business is one of the chief reasons people paint a brick wall as soon as the mortar cures -- to keep moisture out of the bricks and the mortar so the wall lasts.

And even in normal scenes the whole thing feels more natural at the higher fps."
howto,3417d5,IronOreAgate,75,Mon Apr 27 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"isn't the whole reason soap operas look fake because they are using higher frame rate and non-standard cameras to film, since it is low budget? So, in essence, you get stuff that looks like it's been made on a home camcorder instead of achieving the ""cinematic look"", which really is just limiting the frames to 24-32 a second.  This was the whole argument when 120hz first came out too, people said it ruined movies because they looked fake and you could see too much detail....when in reality, it looks too REAL, which is fucking up your immersion, because the effects, makeup, and wardrobe aren't hidden as well without the motion blur.  I'd honestly like to stop the trend of crappy frame rate and blur, and just have film makers adjust for the higher frame rates that they shoot in, and that our TV's can now play accurately. This is not ""soap opera mode"" it's clear picture and higher frame rates exposing how a movie made in 1997 looks like shit. Making ALL movies look just as shitty doesn't make the old movie look better.  Furthermore, it's also why ""it actually looks good for certain movies like the Bourne Identity"", because that was a fast action car chase, where seeing more frames and not having shit blurred allows you to feel the speed of the action and see more of it. No blur or frame rate nerf is needed because the camera is cutting quickly, the action is moving fast, and there are different angles used. Once Bourne walks into a house and has a conversation while walking around slowly, it's going to look ""soap opera"" again; less so, since it is a newer movie, but it will be noticeable."
howto,3417d5,Nebakanezzer,25,Mon Apr 27 16:22:24 2015 UTC,"The ""home video effect"" perception has been called into question for a number of reasons, the primary one being that game consoles starting in the 5th or 6th generation were finally powerful enough to reach beyond 30fps and therefore use that second field as a separate frame the same way TV camcorders do -- and by the middle of the PS2's lifespan, most games did so.  Today, professional HD cameras almost universally have a 480i60 and 1080i60 mode (and even higher!), and made-for-TV content is usually shot in those formats unless it's being made specifically for a network that broadcasts in 720p (shame on you, ABC). The added fidelity of HD, and changes to shot composition and lighting to tease out the fine detail the HD format is capable of, all but eliminate the fabled ""home video effect"".  The primary backlash against 120Hz+ (in the case of consumer TVs) stems from the fact that it's a lie. Current consumer TVs CANNOT accept 120Hz signals, or anything higher. With what's available today, you're not getting anything higher than 1080i60 or 1080p30 (and the latter is VERY rare -- usually 1080p24 is the limit), even if they claim to be 120Hz or higher. Meaning, even if you have 120Hz content, you have to deal with interlacing artifacts being introduced and the framerate being halved with the TV trying to compensate by interpolating. To actually watch content at a framerate higher than 60, you need a purpose-made monitor that usually can only accept such signals over connections generally exclusive to PCs, like dual-link DVI or DisplayPort. Needless to say, movie and TV studios aren't going to bother anytime soon; breaking the 60fps barrier is currently reserved for videogames, and only on the PC.  And why is interpolation not good enough? Because you CANNOT add detail that isn't there. What's happening here is motion interpolation -- either dumb linear, or cross-frame integral approximation. Both methods are guessing the additional frames in between the actual frames in the signal, and some TVs even modify the actual source frames to make it more convincing. There are many MANY cases where these algorithms guess wrong, and the result is jarring artifacting. So, the TV blurs the picture to hide the details that would be mangled. Old movies look ""better"" because the TV is degrading fidelity."

They use certain framing and lighting techniques. They shoot in the standard broadcast framerate, just like most TV shows. They shoot to digital formats, just like most (all) TV shows.   Every frame of action in Bourne has a ton of blur in it, and 120hz processing doesn't change that. It just adds more blur between the blurry frames so that the blur blurs together more evenly.   If someone shoots a movie in 1080p/60fps, then they should play it back in 60fps. In that case, playing at 120fps probably won't make much of a difference, but going from 24 to 120 is just awful."
howto,3417d5,benpatient,5,Mon Apr 27 16:53:28 2015 UTC,"http://www.cnet.com/news/what-is-the-soap-opera-effect/  sure about that kiddo?   However, with 24fps content (namely Hollywood movies and most nonreality, prime-time TV shows like sitcoms and dramas), there's a problem. The cadence of film, and the associated blurring of the slower frame rate's image, is linked to the perception of fiction. Check out the scathing reviews of the high frame rate version of ""The Hobbit""  for proof of that. Even if this perception seems grandiose -- the look of 24fps is expected with movies and fiction TV shows. Even though the TV and movie industries have been moving away from shooting on actual film, the new digital cameras are set for 24fps because the audience for fictional programming expects that look.  SOE messes with this cadence. By creating new frames between the 24 original frames, it causes it to look like 30fps or 60fps content. In other words, it makes movies (24fps) look like soap operas (30/60fps). And thus, a name is born."
howto,3417d5,Nebakanezzer,6,Mon Apr 27 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"You're both confused based on your comments.   Having that mode on doesn't unlock frames from a low frame rate source material that were always there waiting to be played. It creates frames for lower frame rate sources by creating averages in between existing frames, it's faked and doesn't actually look like source 60/120 frames would look like.   Having that mode off doesn't delete frames that were there in high frame rate sources to make the material play low frame rate play on your TV.   Turning the option off allows the tv to just play the frame rate naturally with the source material, not creating extra frames. If you want extra frames in the actual source material I suggest going to movies shot in 60 fps (pretty rare at this point) and talking about why you liked that to drum up interest. As of right now the overwhelming consensus is that 60 fps movies look bad and unrealistic to the eye, maybe it would just take getting used to, but if that's the case then people need to be giving it a shot, and that vote is done in theaters, not by having an irrelevant option on or off on your TV."

This makes everything look jumpy and juttery, because the acceleration rate of everything is jumping around between its actual filmed speed and the interpolated speed, instead of following a smooth natrual curve. Some tvs have better algorithms/hardware than others though,  possibly your tv is better at it.  Then there is also that lots of people dont like higher fps for some reason I cant quite work out."

howto,3417d5,fnufun,3,Mon Apr 27 16:11:50 2015 UTC,"But that has to do with the quality of the film. If the film was made correctly, using good props/stage setup, you wouldn't have that problem.  Stage plays are low quality because they are not meant to be seen up close with a camera. If a films stage and props look like they are meant for a theatre then that is the fault of the producer for allowing shitty props."

The Starship Troopers set looks shitty here because it was never meant to be displayed with increased brightness and other effects which reveal all of it's flaws. Sure you can say that makes Starship Troopers bad, and we can sit and judge how bad the set design was, but I'd rather watch it as the director intended - 1:1 color as edited and at the framerate it was shot in. The entire editing process is maximizing what they can get out of the resources they have available, at least on first viewing we should try to see it as intended."
howto,3417d5,TheSystem_IsDown,2,Mon Apr 27 20:39:26 2015 UTC,I think all people who said that they liked the soap opera effect probably refer to the frame interpolation part not the dynamic contrast part.   Some movies really benefit from an improved frame rate. I like frame interpolation on my computer because I can set every quality settings on max and I can't stand it on my TV because I see all the artifacts due to low performances.  But I think most people don't really like dynamic contrast when most of the time you get washed out colors.
howto,3417d5,legaston,6,Mon Apr 27 21:39:43 2015 UTC,"Every frame of a movie already has motion blur in it. The motion blending takes 2 frames, and adds 4-10 extra frames between each pair, all of them generated by mixing the two together. It's a destructive process, something akin to opening a photo in Photoshop and turning Noise Reduction all the way up.  It murders HD film grain, for one thing.   If you enjoyed the Hobbit movies in 48p, then you probably like the  120p blending, I guess.   The Hobbit, at least, had 48 real frames in there.   I can see some argument for using motion blending on 60fps interlaced footage, especially sporting events shot in 1080i. Beyond that, it's the Sweet N Low of video."
howto,3417d5,benpatient,0,Mon Apr 27 16:37:48 2015 UTC,"It's really not. The real point here should be that we've been GETTING Sweet-N-Low, and higher FPS is getting real sugar. We're so addicted to a lower standard that we are fighting against an improvement.  If modern movies switched to better utilize modern technology - like The Hobbit (which looked horrible because of terrible CGI, not because of the 48p rendering) then older movies would start to look horrible in comparison."
howto,3417d5,TheGreatDL,5,Mon Apr 27 19:42:11 2015 UTC,"If the Hobbit looked horrible because of the CGI, then show me an example of something running 48fps that doesn't look horrible. Half of the problem I had with the Hobbit movies wasn't the bad CGI, it was the costumes/makeup on the non-CGI characters (especially the dwarves).   This thread is about artificially increasing the framerate of low-framerate things. I said that we should leave things in the rate they were shot in, regardless of what it was.   Maybe 48fps can look good. The argument for its use for 3D certainly makes sense on paper, for example. My only personal experience with it was decidedly horrible. Horrible enough that when my family went to go see the 3rd one during Christmas break, and I, feeling like I didn't want to be ""that guy"" and ruin it for everyone, even though I knew it would suck in 48fps 3D, took my brother and law and went to the concurrently playing 2D 24fps showing. It still sucked, I must admit, but at least the suck wasn't so...present.   48fps would be great for one of those flight simulator things, like the hang gliding experience at Disney World, for example. Sign me up for that.   Watching a movie, where the camera can be 6 inches from an actor's face...it SHOULD be a window into a world. It's a whole different language.   Like I said...maybe someone can make a 48fps movie that I enjoy. So far...nothing has done that for me, at all.  This isn't just nostalgia or ""what we're used to"" talking. If it were, every Hollywood blockbuster being released this year (and last year) would have been in 48fps."
howto,3417d5,benpatient,0,Mon Apr 27 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, it's about ""getting used to it."" I have a 120hz TV and I honestly could never go back to the old 60hz setups. Everything looks crisper, more clear, and more natural. Yes, older movies make it look like you're watching a stage play (shots from The Last Crusade's intro on the boat were particularly noticeable) but overall, the effect is a better image. The human eye sees the world at 60fps, and that's what films should be shot in.   My point here is, now that we have the ability to push the limit, movie studios SHOULD be creating works in these new formats. They aren't because it would take time and money. They'd have to do an even better job on sets and makeup, for example. Much like the 30fps v 60fps argument in video games (which isn't an argument: 60fps is objectively better) taking shortcuts and saving money is the reason why the standard hasn't changed yet.   It's a slow process, breaking away from established trends. But I do think it will happen some day. My best advice is to simply expose yourself to 120hz TVs and watch them as usual. It's VERY jarring at first. But eventually, your brain adjusts and the difference in quality is worthwhile. If films were to keep up with the tech, I think we could hit a new level of fidelity that is truly ""Real."""
howto,3417d5,TheGreatDL,3,Mon Apr 27 20:50:24 2015 UTC,"there is no difference in quality if all of the frames they add are just interpolated from the existing 24 or 30 frames. It's fake.  If the source material was 120hz, then fine...play it at 120fps.   You are contradicting your own argument, though. You just said you could ""never go back"" to a 60hz tv, but that the human eye sees the world at that rate. It can't be both.   Almost everything that makes a soap opera look the way it does is the lighting setup and the lenses they put on those studio cameras. It's the byproduct of needing to do 100 shots from 20 different camera angles in a single room every day. You can't light each shot. You light the scene for ANY shot, and then you pick a lens that lets you get everything in focus at the same time. Action.  The frame rate plays a minimal part in this, and that's why I'm so annoyed by the use of ""soap opera effect"" to describe the motion interpolation."
howto,3417d5,benpatient,-1,Mon Apr 27 21:03:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I don't think it should be called ""Soap Opera Effect.""  60hz != 60fps. Hertz is the refresh rate of the TV. Movies are filmed at 24fps. Which is why it seems fuzzy, blurry, and slow in comparison to real life.   120hz+ TVs are adding in the extra frames (interpolation, as mentioned) which smooths out the picture. Crappy TVs with crappy interpolation features do indeed make a picture look worse. But modern interpolation is quite good, and relatively seamless.  The argument against higher frame rates is ""It makes it look less like a movie."" That's not a real argument. That's holding onto the past out of a fear of change. The entire industry needs to step up their game."

I go to Costco once a month, and they typically have 20-30 TVs on display when you walk in, ranging from $300 to $5,000. It's obvious when the interpolation is turned on, and even on the really expensive TVs, it doesn't look good with anything where the camera isn't doing a smooth, steady pan.

In other words, they added motion blur because without it, people found it distracting and distasteful.   Other than Cameron's Avatar sequels, which are reportedly going to be 60fps, and some random noise about other potential things being done in FPS, nothing has come out. The Hobbit trilogy started shooting in 48fps in 2011. So in 4 years...crickets. Maybe one project from someone known for pushing the envelope beyond what most people care about.

New Line sold a bunch of theaters on new hardware to run 48fps 3D, and then nothing else came out. $10k per room for a new projector for a format that has had exactly 3 releases in 4 years isn't a very good investment.

They somehow think higher frame rate is worse because it looks ""fake"" when really it looks more real than anything and you see more flaws of ""movie magic."" What I think that means is that for Hollywood to get 48 fps to work they need to do better movie magic. They need to get in there and figure out what works with it and what doesn't. Don't just keep doing the same things they have been for the last 40 years and use a faster frame rate camera... which is what the Hobbit was."

The purpose of the smoothing should be to fix the problem with LCDs that the image doesn't fade out between frames like an old tube TV / CRT.  Or maybe LED TVs do this now?  I'm out of date, I bought my LCD 6 or 7 years ago.  Anyway, since LCDs don't fade the picture between frames, when it snaps to a new frame, the sudden change actually creates a sort of blur in your brain, ruining the picture a bit.  The smoothing should be used to prevent this blurring, rather than to create an ultra-realistic (and ironically realism- and immersion-destroying) smoothness.  So: for best results, set the smoothing to a low setting, but don't actually turn it off."

The unintended side effect is that the extra visual detail gives the entire film a sickly sheen of fakeness: the props look embarrassingly proppy and the rubber noses look a great deal more rubbery than nosey.

So the TV blurs the picture to hide the blemishes. It's disgusting. I think they're only getting away with it because, well, think about how many people buy their HD screens and watch 480i content on the anamorphic setting. The layman never was getting HD."

howto,3417d5,JagerBaBomb,2,Mon Apr 27 18:16:01 2015 UTC,"Some important things that are missing from this discussion...  A television image comprises of multiple parts, but if you break it up into two parts (signal in and image on screen) it makes the most sense.  No matter what happens between them, those numbers don't change.  The signal in gets complex, as the signal in will mirror the signal out from the source (if your blu-ray player is set to output 60z and the television accepts a 60z signal, your signal in will be 60z).  What that means, is you need to make sure your source and your signal in are set for the best performance possible.  If you have a 120hz or higher television, this is your preferred setup (ignore this if you have a 4K tv):  For your blu-ray player, set the output to 1080p24hz. For your cable/satellite box, set it to 1080p60hz. For a video game console, set it to 1080p60hz.  If you want the most accurate image possible from your television, set the motion flow settings to off. This doesn't negatively affect the higher hz of the set, it simply eliminates the artificially created frames.  If you have a 120hz tv and the signal input is 24hz, the television can repeat the image 5 times per second and the picture will be consistent but choppy during a pan or a fast motion sequence.  The image will be 1-1-1-1-1-2-2-2-2-2-3-3-3-3-3..., simply repeating the image on screen.  If frame interpolation is turned on, the image will be 1-1-1-1.5-1.5-1.5-1.5-1.5-2-2-2-2.5-2.5-2.5..., which is why the image looks more smooth.  The blur between image 1 and 2 is reduced by image 1.5, but the side effect is an inconsistently smooth image.  Part of what separates a better tv from a lower quality television is the quality of the interpolation.  A better tv will have a better processor and better software to create better images.  Even when turned off, the better processor will clean up the image, reduce blur and artifacts, and create a better on screen image.    The benefits of a 120z tv (beyond its ability to handle a 24hz signal more accurately), is a reduction in the length of time the image is on the screen, which leads to motion blurring.  There are a couple of ways to accomplish this, from black frame insertion to frame repetition, but again, a better set will handle this process more accurately.  Quality signal, quality output, quality input.  There are a ton of things that are important to know, and for those who have questions I would happily answer them, but if you simply want to set it and forget it for lack of a better term, just do as I described."
howto,3417d5,benpatient,2,Mon Apr 27 20:07:12 2015 UTC,Why is the brightness changed in the comparison images?  That shouldn't happen.  Of course the image is ruined (more) if you blast the brightness.

howto,3417d5,krokodil2000,2,Mon Apr 27 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"SVP does a much better job of this than your average TV, though. I feel like TV's seem to slow down and speed up, depending on the motion in the screen. It's really distracting."
howto,3417d5,ogreyo,3,Mon Apr 27 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"Well, a tiny, cheap little microchip is constantly guessing about what the next frame is going to contain. The screen doesn't have more than the couple of milliseconds of delay you are experiencing in order to figure out what those interpolated frames are supposed to be showing. For 24 fps, and a 3 frame (0.125 second) buffer, that's a rolling average of 0.025 seconds per fake 1080p or 4K frame, including whatever other processing is happening. The chip is going to take those 2-3 real frames it has in buffer, and try to work out all of those fake frames in near real time. If the camera is panning horizontally (traditionally the weak spot of 24fps motion), and the pan doesn't speed up or slow down, then it does a pretty decent job tracking objects, especially if they are already blurry due to the motion blur in the original frames. That blur isn't going away at 120hz, it's just being smoothed out. But what happens when the camera moves slightly erratically? Hand-held style action sequence panning is a nightmare for these chips. They can't make any meaningful adaptive predictions about where things are headed (remember that they don't have access to anything in the video file beyond what they are getting in the screen buffer), so it's being constantly surprised.   As it shapes a new motion line, it has to make constant adjustments. With an uneven pan, that means speeding up and slowing down near-constantly. It feels like someone strapped rubber bands to the end of the lens."

The reason why it drives me crazy in particular is because the interpolation gives some psychophysical effect of the movie having a variable frame rate. For example in an action movie when there is just plain, calm movement, dialogue perhaps, then a sudden movement, like an explosion and people running, the frame rate is perceived as changing, causing, for me, an uneasy, almost nauseous sudden change. I'm saying that the frame rate seems to double quite suddenly when there is drastic movements (fast changes in pixel values), then seems to change back to a standard rate when there is little movement. I've noticed this especially in older movies that were standardized in 30-60FPS, and particularly pre-HD era cinema.  DRIVES ME NUTS!!"

Which, given, is what you have in the average American household: the layman is watching 480i content stretched to fill the screen with other ""image enhancements"" enabled and thinking it's HD. As you upgrade to better resolutions and adjust your set to get the most fidelity out of the picture, the quality loss becomes more and more apparent.  On the same token, the problem with the example videos on the Internet is that they're at a smaller resolution and a much lower bitrate than you're going to get from broadcast or blu-ray content, so the finer detail that usually gets eaten by the interpolation and related postprocessing is also obliterated by compressing it down to the smaller size in both the ""on"" and ""off"" sides. This obscures most of the problems created by motion interpolation, making the ""comparison"" much closer than it actually is in practice.  These TVs usually apply a blur to the picture to try to hide the artifacting created by the interpolation, especially if they're using a naive linear method (which is what I'd expect -- the microprocessors with the muscle to do integral approximation in real time are, well, expensive). You're sacrificing fine detail for smoother but flawed motion. I can believe it looks better on settings that are already eating a lot of detail, which, unfortunately, is the norm."

howto,3417d5,kindall,0,Mon Apr 27 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"Enabling or disabling this really comes down to the movie you are watching. Higher frame rates and motion smoothing has the effect of making things look 'too' real. Films that use real-life sets and action sequences typically do well with motion smoothing. That's why car chase scenes and fights actually look great with it. Sports are generally great in high frame rates. Try the effect on a film with miniature sets, a lot of composting etc, and you're able to see all the flaws too well. Starship Troopers makes an excellent example of this. It was a cheap film to begin with, the props and sets were very rough. The sets simply don't hold up to the visual acuity required for higher frame rates and it makes it look cheap."

It's been AWESOME. Whenever I get sick of something, I just drop it off at the thrift store and buy something different! There's so much more variety, hand-craftedness, and fun to be had! And no buyer's remorse.  Same goes for appliances - we replaced all the appliances in the house we bought (washer, dryer, stove, dishwasher, fridge, range hood) for $800 total.

Sheet metal all around, except the 60ft front side. Building is 18' tall in front, sloping to 17' in back for rain shedding. The metal poles for the legs are 3"" and are set 24"" in the ground with a 10"" diameter hole of Quickcrete holding them in place. Good month-long project when we had free time.

The hardest part I'd say was hoisting the girders up top with a tractor and muscle.     It was all easy-mode except for the Texas heat, 95-105F every day, half of the time was spent working at night due to that. I was in charge of fabricating it all while he was at his regular plant job, and I really only had input from him for logistics and the siding and girders.    The poles were set freshly after I hammered the old concrete from them, and we put 6"" extension rings on the ends of the poles at 9' up, then welded more pole to the top of each one until it was correct height. C-beams at the top longitudinally for support of the sheet metal,, then girders front-back for structural support. Don't forget to make the back shorter than the front for rain and snow (if applicable) to shed.    If you are planning on using wood at all, make sure it is treated for outdoor use, as it will rot faster than you think. For budget longevity, nothing beats scrap steel repurposed."

Then a fire happened last year and i was in the burned out place assessing our inventory to make sure we got something fair from the insurance. The tiles were pretty damaged closest to the fire, like blackened, but the tiles have since been replaced, so I can't get a sample to take to a lab. What do I do?"
howto,33pclf,Hawkonthehill,3,Sat Apr 25 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about it.  12x12 alone isn't a guarantee it's asbestos. It has to be old as well (before 1986).  Quite frankly, there is nothing you CAN do. the tile was removed or covered up already.    Even if you worked in an asbestos plant, it typically takes 50 years to develop any symptoms.  and who knows, there may be a cure by then.    To sum it up, Don't worry. It may not have been asbestos, your exposure (IF ANY) was limited, you were dealing with the least dangerous form of asbestos (floor tiles are safer than insulation), and even if you huffed it, symptoms wouldn't appear for 50 years.    EDIT: Oh i forgot to mention, walking on the tiles, playing on the tiles, sleeping on the tiles is totally safe.  It's only potentially dangerous when the tiles get broken up and IF pieces of the tiles become airborne."

howto,33pclf,Number_6,5,Sat Apr 25 16:37:44 2015 UTC,There is a big difference between friable and non-friable asbestos.  Asbestos tile are normally non-friable so unless you pulverize them into a fine dust then there is nothing to worry about.

Your sentence confused me, so let me try, because this is important. Asbestos dust is bad. Friable means it can be broken into small particles that can be airborne. That is, dust.  As long as it is solid material, or painted, or otherwise coated so that there is no dust, it is relatively OK."
howto,33pclf,Number_6,7,Fri Apr 24 18:03:37 2015 UTC,"Friable asbestos is already in a state where if disturbed the particles WILL become airborne and are harmful.  Non-friable is a solid ACM (asbestos containing material). If non-friable asbestos is left in a solid state, in this case vinyl tile or even broken vinyl tile if removed, will not generate harmful airborne particles unless pulverized or sanded.  Government regulations regarding the removal of non-friable asbestos are much more lax than those for friable asbestos.  EDIT: Simply breaking up the tile would not generate the same amount of dust that asbestos containing insulation or ceiling tiles would.  Here is a quote from www.asbestos-abatement.com   ""The EPA called """"non-friable"""" the generally less dangerous form of ACM, not very likely to release asbestos fibers into the air. A non-friable ACM is a material containing more than 1% asbestos but not able to be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure when dry, using the same methods."""

howto,33pclf,l00pee,11,Fri Apr 24 14:32:02 2015 UTC,"so yeah, get a buffer and a green pad that you can put under the buffer.  super wet the floor and spread comet cleanser all over.  Take and scrub it with the buffer with the green pad underneath.  Mop. Then mop again, then probably once more to get all of the cleanser and mess off of the floor. Now clean your baseboards because there's cleanser goop all over them.  Depending on your wax, mix wax with clean  (super important) water/mop and spread on the floor with a mop. Make it nice and even and cover every inch. Make sure your mop is fucking clean.  Let dry.  Buff. Then buff again. Then probably buff again.  Once that is done, you can put a tshirt or other super soft cloth under the buffer and buff again.  Post a guard and threaten murder to anyone that walks on the floor.  For more advanced, flammable, although extremely shiny (but short lived) floors, use paste wax. All steps are the same except the wax part. Paste wax (in my experience) is a 2 man job:  One man is in front of the buffer. He lights the can of paste wax and lets it burn until a considerable amount is liquid, Then blows it out and pours a line of the molten wax onto the floor. The buffer man immediately spreads this wax with the buffer, repeat.  Buff until you are tired of buffing, it almost seems to shine more every time. The softer the polishing pad, the higher shine you'll have. Just know, ever time someone steps on the floor it will leave a mark and within hours you will see the traffic areas. These buff out easy without reapplication of wax, but you will need to keep a buffer handy.  If you go the wax route, there are three things that are now true:  1) Your floor will be awesome.  2) You are forever at the behest of the buffer.  3) you will never be able to do the floor again without stripping and waxing UNLESS you want to accept the floor the way it looks now. Every time you apply wax you will need to strip the old wax then reapply or you'll simply start to buff dirt into the floor."

I was a carpet cleaner for years with a great small company, and we would clean linoleum (I'm assuming) tile like that often to varying results. Stripping and rewaxing is probably your only bet, assuming there is any wax left on there. Honestly, as most other people have said here, removing it all is probably your best option.

Tailor this to your size, but if you see the same faces enough so they start to become familiar, just get yourself next to them, as though by accident, then a look of surprise, and a ""Oh hey! I think I've seen you here before (or ""I've seen you at shows like this around town""). What's up, I'm /u/ohsnapt!"" Let them reply with as much or as little as they like and go from there.  For instance, if they say their name and something like ""Yeah, I'm here every weekend,"" or something about the frequency with which they are at that event or type of event, then just follow up on that. ""Yeah? Cool. What kinds of EDM are you into?"" Then if you know of more events coming soon, tell them about those events and offer to meet them there to hang out more.  If they clam up completely, don't take it personally; it's not about you. Maybe they just weren't in the mood to chat or were going through some stuff in their own lives. Just say something friendly ""Alright, good to see you again. Take care!"" and move on to the next person.  Keep the initial conversation short (unless you absolutely hit it off immediately), always giving yourself an out so you don't hit the wall of uncomfortable silence. For example, say you've got a buddy 'over there' you don't want to keep waiting or something like that.  Don't meta yourself too much. People can listen to EDM at home if they don't want to socialize to some extent. Get out of your own way and learn how to chat people up!  BTW, I wrote this with platonic friendship in mind (that is, I'm assuming you're a guy and you're just thinking of meeting some cool people to hang out with). However, the process is remarkably similar if you're looking for someone to eventually date. It's 2015 and guys and girls are pretty much the same at that initial ""getting to know you"" level.  Confidence is the key here. Not a big grin, just an easygoing, low-key demeanor. But again, your mileage may vary, so tailor this to however it best fits you. Good luck out there, buddy! :)"

If you have a multi-tool (one without a corkscrew I suppose) I recommend removing a screw from a nearby door hinge. Door hinge screws usually have a big, flat head on them that makes the easy to grip with pliers. Screw it down into the cork and then grip the screw head with the pliers and pull. Takes a little elbow grease but I've opened up maybe a half dozen bottles this way over the years."
howto,33lclw,ProfessorMembrane,2,Thu Apr 23 21:12:24 2015 UTC,Poke a car or house key into the cork and turn until cork works out. Takes like 15 seconds. It's so easy that I do it instead of walking 30 feet inside to get a cork screw sometimes
howto,33lclw,gpewett,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"I have two problems with this video.    Why doesn't the cork expand at all after it is removed? I realize that wine corks don't expand much bigger than the bottle they are in but there is a moment right about 1:15 where you get a good look at the cork. It has really expanded.  Why is there so much red wine already coming out of the bottle? Again at 1:15, you see a lot of red wine has splashed out covering the cork and the buys shirt.    I know that this can be done. I am not contesting the validity of the process. However, something just seems off about this video."

howto,334ehv,rsfc,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:10:23 2015 UTC,left handed drill bits are a solution. They are spun in a drill backwards and as the drill bit bites into the metal of the screw it will(hopefully) loosen the fouled up screw. iFixit has a set of pliers for just this type of task although I have never bought or used a set. You take the jaw of the pliers and grip the head of the screw from the side and try to work out the screw that way. Epoxy might be another solution since it's tougher than superglue.

howto,32qalr,lazychris2000,2,Thu Apr 16 05:42:11 2015 UTC,That's interesting that dogs can see some browns. That must mean they have some basic red sensors that cats don't have.
howto,32qalr,yathern,9,Thu Apr 16 08:45:41 2015 UTC,"I don't have an exact answer, because you don't have an exact question. The scope of what your asking could require either a simple filter for fun, or several thousand dollars of grant money and spectrometers and who knows what. Instead I'll just dump a stream of consciousness to get you on the right path.  Well. The reason monitors and everything use RGB to display colors is because we have three rods for colors in our eyes. Red, Green and Blue. This is a gross oversimplification. Anyway - they overlap a bit - so for each 'pixel' of your vision, if the rod detects highish red, and low green green, and no blue, you'll get an intense orange. If combining red and green to make orange doesn't make sense to you, you should look up additive color.  So, to accurately model a cat's vision, you'd have to do research about how their eyes work. What cones they have, and the absorption spectrum. Then you have to map the hue of colors on an image to their wavelength. Change the luminosity based on the absorption rate of that wavelength on the cats eye as a total sum of the rods or whatever. You could create a black and white image that reflects the general ability to discern shapes of different colors. Getting a color version would be harder - but colors are a matter of perception anyway. To get colors, you'd better hope cats only have 3 rods or less. Otherwise, you essentially can't show their vision unless you have magic vision and a special tv.  To get color for two cones of color perception, you could do a gradient map type of thing where the two sides are opposite colors.  Additionally, if cats can see infrared or ultraviolet - cameras don't capture this data, so you can't recreate it in photoshop, unless you have special equipment."
howto,32qalr,aoe2bug,3,Wed Apr 15 23:54:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I knew that cats only had blue and green sensitive cones, but I wasn't sure of how to translate that into a filter. The rest of your comment helped clear that up. I'll see if I can come up with something.  I also found this Wired article that tried to do the same thing. It has some examples for anyone else that is interested."
howto,32qalr,obsidian_butterfly,5,Thu Apr 16 02:08:31 2015 UTC,"To add to this, a cat's eye has a slit-shaped iris which affects the smoothness of the out-of-focus area of the image (Bokeh) as well as the shape of specular highlights in the image.  To simulate this accurately you would need a depth map for the image and a completely-in-focus input image; you would selectively blur out-of-focus areas using the iris shape information. I'm not sure how you'd handle the specular highlights, but having an hdr input is probably necessary."

It certainly has it's good points in my opinion, but if you know anything about computers, you should be fine to buy off craigslist.  Just meet somewhere publicly and turn on the computer and inspect it fully.  I would make sure there is a recovery disc(I don't quite know how macs work) but some way to restore the system just in case there are viruses on there."

It's absolutely free, just like filing paper forms, only electronically though your web browser, and your refund will come back at the same speed of any prep software.  It doesn't matter how much or what type of income you receive.  You can append every schedule that exists.  The one major caveat is YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.  It doesn't ask you questions.  Apart from very basic arithmetic, you are doing everything by hand.  If you are not comfortable sitting down with PDFs of IRS published instructions and educating yourself on how taxes work, this is not the route for you.  That being said, the vast majority of people really don't have crazy complicated taxes IMO.  Who here on this thread is filing an 8 page Schedule K?  Nobody.

I have used the single edge, coke line cutting (like in all 80's movies) razor blades to scrape a glass cooktop range clean of food residue. Never had to remove melted plastic but once the main thickness of plastic is gone it shouldn't be too much trouble to finish scraping it clean. Then follow up with some glass cooktop cleaner/ polish. In an extreme case you could get one of those razor blade scrapers for removing wallpaper from HD/ Lowes since the razor blade is wider and it has a handle for better control."

But here are answers to all of your questions. Let me know if anything else comes to mind. I really do appreciate you taking your time to help out and share your thoughts.   What is your budget?   Budget is up in the air at the moment, because we are coordinating with a music festival, it will really come down to them to decide what kind of budget they could support. Ideally we would want to keep cost of materials under $5,000, but if the build is really well done and can last, then price can be inflated accordingly.   What is the weight of what it has to support?   The brain structure that it will hold weighs roughly 250-300lbs.   Will you need to disassemble it without destroying it?   For ease of transport, it would best if it was 4 large segments or so.   How easily disassemble does it have to be?   Ideally it wouldn't take more than a day to assemble/install   How heavy or light does it need to be?   It doesn't have to be heavy necessarily, but durability is important.   Mostly empty at the top, or top to bottom?   The top of the head (where the brain would sit) is where it would be empty/hollow.   Will people enter it?   No, it will be more of a sculpture than the structure.   Does it have to meet safety requirements?   Because it won't house any people, it just has to be safe on the outside, and not crumble.   What building skills do you have?   I myself have some basic experience working with wood, metal, and foam. My team on the other hand is much more experienced with fabrication and together we are pretty flexible. I will bring on other team members if necessary to accomplish what we want   What ideas have you come up with so far?   First thought was to go to a metal workshop and them construct the entire thing out of metal. My second thought was some sort of thick wiremesh sculpture with a solid covering. My most recent idea was to work with a group of 3D printers and have them print it out into essentially puzzle pieces that we could patch together to create the whole structure.   What are their strengths?   Getting a shop to make the piece out of metal would look very clean and also be durable and reasonably long lasting. The wiremesh method would allow us to do unique things like maybe grow vegetation throughout the mesh and give the sculpture a ""living"" feeling. 3D printing would be a very efficient means of creating it and could give us even more unique capacities.   What are their drawbacks?   Commissioning the metal shop could cost 10s of thousand of dollars. Getting the wire mesh to look/feel the way we desire would be difficult without some sort of rigid inner framework. 3D printing would probably be the most expensive and is potentially a very complicated method of assembly.   How much time do you have?   We're planning to do this for the festival in 2016, so we have over a year to plan, design, and build.   Do you have access to CAD design or milling equipment?   I have one team mate who is pretty capable with CAD and we do have a few shops we could go to for milling and laser cutting.   Do you have vacuum forming facilities available?   I do not believe we do, though one of my team members may have a connection to one   What tools do you have available?   We have very basic tools, more-so suited for wood working than anything else."

Whatever it is needs as wide a footprint as possible with that much weight held 5-6 feet high.   It doesn't have to be heavy necessarily, but durability is important.   So straight foam is out.  Maybe fibergalss over foam with bent tube framework?   ...3D printers and have them print it out into essentially puzzle pieces that we could patch together to create the whole structure.   That would be awesome.   ...wiremesh method would allow us to do unique things like maybe grow vegetation throughout the mesh...Getting the wire mesh to look/feel the way we desire would be difficult without some sort of rigid inner framework...   Wire mesh covered in irish moss strikes me as something that could look great, but might invite comparisons to a Chia head.  Workability of the wire mesh could be a strong point though.     We're planning to do this for the festival in 2016, so we have over a year to plan, design, and build.   Nice   I have one team mate who is pretty capable with CAD and we do have a few shops we could go to for milling and laser cutting.   Maybe another sub could help better with tube frame building that could be light, ""cheap,"" and doesn't need vehicle-level rigidity."

I don't have to manually resize and then move my windows around so that I can see both.    On Mac I use a freeware called Cinch to mimic the feature and it's absolutely fantastic as well.    Oh, and using the Chrome web inspector? Split a screen side by side and then going through the inspector to see what I'm modifying? So easy.    Even non-work related, I like to have my music playlist take up half a screen and have the other half-screen show my twitter feed or news feed.

When I proposed to my fiancee I took her on an outing. We went to the place where we had our first date for a bite to eat. Then we went on a walk around another place we'd had one of our early dates. There was a beautiful view of the city, and it was there that I sang her a song that was meaningful to the two of us and proposed. It wasn't a huge over the top deal, no big crowds or stunts. But it was special and from the heart, and that made it amazing.  tl;dr don't worry about over the top, just be genuine and do something that will be meaningful to the both of you."

She Goes out of her way to help anyone and everyone because that is just who she is. She is always trying to put me 1st in ever situation.   We met through a friend. She had been through a long list of crappy boyfriends and dates. I had been divorced for about 2 years. I joking asked a friend if they knew anyone that wanted to be with a divorced fat guy with a beard and a daughter? (from my marriage). Her response was, Maybe... She sent me a picture of we will call her Tina. Tina Took my breath away. I was like no way this girl would ever want the baggage of a daughter and be with a guy like me. Our friend asked me for pictures to send to her. So she gave me a shot. We went out to a dueling piano bar.  Something where we could just enjoy the show and there wouldn't be this awkward back and forth. She text me that night and said she had the best time she had ever had on a 1st date and she felt something special. IT has been great ever sense. We have had some major bad news dropped on our laps but have seemed to get through it. I just want to do something special and over the top to show her how crazy I am for her.   http://imgur.com/eRnsEjd - This was us a few weeks ago."

Ozone generators really do work well for smell removal. The stuff is so good at killing organic molecules that large scale bottled water plants ozone treat the water before bottling. Kills any bacteria and turns to oxygen in 24 hours. I actually service industrial ozone making machines for bottling, and trust me. They are serious business. I bought a used van and the previous owner had BO problems. I do my van once a year to keep it fresh. A decent unit can do a big room or a whole house easy enough. Just make sure you leave. Put it on a 24 hour timer before a weekend trip away. When you get home, run in, crank open all the windown, run back out fast and wait few hours.

RET  finishing.com  Pine Beach, New Jersey  Says:  ""Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) has sufficient NaOH in it to hold the pH high enough to keep the chlorine in solution so it doesn't immediately deteriorate or explosively decompose, and enough water that it can be reasonably stable. I doubt that Clorox has a significant amount of anything else in it, but it's a brand name, so I suppose it might have trace amount of something if they decide.  The idea of bleach is essentially to offer you the functionality of chlorine gas, but dissolved into a water solution. Chlorine gas can't stay dissolved unless the pH of the solution is held high with NaOH, and there is a reasonable amount of water, and it's kept out of sun light. That's perhaps the main reason it is dangerous to mix bleach with other materials: if the reaction lowers the pH, the chlorine gas will fill the air.""  Edit: Formatting."

howto,31hoj8,arugulakale,6,Sun Apr 5 04:20:31 2015 UTC,"Without really knowing enough to comment, I'll go ahead and comment...  The seemingly obvious answer is, of course, to just listen and consider what other people are suggesting and to communicate rather than shut down.  If you're negative because you're arrogant, you might want to consider the benefits of humility and consider the possibility that you may not be the source of infinite wisdom and that people care enough about you to offer you suggestions--and even though their suggestions may not be what you want or may not even be helpful, perhaps they're coming from a place of caring and that, in itself, is a good thing that you can just accept for what it is.  If you're negative because you're scared (aka perfectionism), you may benefit from reminding yourself that new and different things are sometimes unavoidably scary but that you can become comfortable with new experiences without having to resist them first; it can be ok to just accept something and go along with it.  If you're negative because it's a way of expressing your anger, it may be helpful to think about (and maybe write down) the specific reasons for your anger; if you can get yourself thinking more clearly, you may find yourself able to respond differently when confronted with situations that are currently playing out in ways that you don't prefer.  If none of this helps, I have found it's helpful to talk to everyone as if they're members in a band I really like--it makes me automatically more pleasant without trying."

howto,31hoj8,pk_dnkx,2,Sun Apr 5 08:05:45 2015 UTC,Other people bring a different perspective to what you're doing. The more perspectives you have the more you understand a situation. Others also know a lot more than you may think. It seems like you are having problems with suggestions about something you are doing. Perhaps you have difficulty with attachment?
howto,31hoj8,i_Got_Rocks,2,Sun Apr 5 06:46:04 2015 UTC,"Adding to what others say:  Perhaps you're set in your ways. It's not always a bad thing, since you probably figured out that you make good calls and you do it with good reasons. Eventually, you forget WHY you were able to make good calls and just go to the result, which is, ""Nope.""  It sounds like a habit. Habits are hard to break--but not impossible.    Try Empathy: when a suggestion comes your way, hold it for as long as you can, and ask yourslf, ""this person suggested this thing. But why? There must be a benefit that they believe can do some benefit."" If you can't see the benefit, then ask them, ""Hey! Thanks for the suggestion--I wanna maybe try it--but I was just wondering, what made you think of me in this thing?""  If you phrase it like that, you reassure them that you don't think badly of their suggestion (most people will suggest things that might help, not hurt), and that you appreciate them for thinking of you.  Say yes to one suggestion a day. Period. Since this is a habit--you need to change it. Once you go through with a couple of them, you'll realize that life is more fun when you're open to new experiences. ""20 years from now, you'll be more hurt by the things you didn't do, than by the things you tried."""

Semi-serious rules, you wore uniforms if you happened to have them and there ended up being just as many in-shape 20 somethings as seniors and even the old men were fit for their age.   I would've stayed with it had it been closer.  But THEN, I found my nearest medium-sized city's Parks Dept had an adult league which sounded exactly like what I wanted: completely serious, you had to try out, full uniforms and you traveled city to city (or maybe they just had enough players for multiple teams in the city). Basically AA or whatever it's called, but more informal. Sadly, I never tried out or joined, I was over that phase in my life by then.  TLDR: Contact your Parks Dept."

The video shows a basic concept on how to make chainmaille, but there is no instruction on how to attach the strips made together. This was the biggest hurdle I had when learning chainmaille.

If you are currently scoring the whole piece at the same time, it does not surprise me that you are having issues.  You are weakening the glass in too many places."

howto,30sr45,Spatulamarama,2,Mon Mar 30 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"It works because you'r removing the UV Coat that protects the plastic. Then the plastic will now be entirely exposed and will yellow/fog even faster. The only proper way would be to progressively sand your headlights from like 600 grit to 2000 to get to a clean even layer of plastic. Then you can apply a new UV coat that will last many many more years. That is the proper way to fix your headlights. Any quick fix chemical/toothpaste/urban legend/etc., is just removing layers and speeding up the deterioration that has been going since the sun first hit the car for the first time from the factory.

howto,30sr45,zykooo,0,Mon Mar 30 14:26:50 2015 UTC,"your concern for the integrity of the plastic lens would be warranted if the lens was a few molecules thick. melting only a few molecules at the surface has precisely the same effect on the remainder of the lens as scrapping that layer with abrasives.  solvents can not penetrate if they are removed. wiping thoroughly with an absorbent towel removes any solvent left on the surface.  your contention - ""very small amounts of chemicals left in the headlight will continue to eat away at the headlight"" is an overstatement. of course, leaving a full deposit of solvent on plastics will result in damage, but that's an extreme i doubt many concerned will perform if they value their car at all. in fact, a thorough wiping with a clean absorbent towel will remove all traces of this actually mild  solvent.    btw, using abrasives carelessly can ruin a lens just a quickly and permanently as using a mild solvent."

Once your headlights are damaged by this method you have to buy new ones which is by far more expensive than polishing them. By the way: if you are on the cheap you can polish your headlights with tooth paste as well. takes some time but does the job.

This method, while fast and cheap, will not last and has a really big potential for permanently ruining your headlights.   The reason why your headlights yellow is because the UV resistant coating has started to fail.   The proper way to fix this is to wet sand then remaining coating off (600 - 2000 Grit), polish the lens back to clear, and then add some type of UV resistant coating (wax, sealant, quartz coating, clear spray paint, or even thinned SPAR urethane). Lasts about 2-3 years)  You can forgo the sanding and just polish the lenses with a microfiber cloth and some automotive polishing compound, and then add some type of wax or sealant over the lenses. This will look good for a few months and then have to be done again once the sealant wears off."

If the car's outer finish is not protected by a wax coating or polyurethane, the oxygen molecules in the air will eventually start interacting with the paint. As the oxygen burns up the free radicals contained in the paint, the finish becomes duller and duller. Restoration efforts may include removing several layers of affected paint and reapplying a new layer of protectant. This is why professional car detailers recommend at least one layer of wax or other protectant be used every time the car is washed."
howto,30vf8v,tinkerpunk,2,Tue Mar 31 00:46:28 2015 UTC,"You need to think about your budget, keeping in mind that a cheap mattress is a complete misery and utter waste of money. This is a big investment.  Give yourself time to shop around, and make it clear to the sales people that you are shopping around. Commit to trying at least half a dozen brands before you even THINK about plunking down the money. Sales people are out to make sales, so you need to be able to resist.  My favorite mattress of all time was a sleep number. I am pretty good at resisting sales pressure, so I have no problem at all letting people go through their whole sales schtick and walking out ""Just thinking about it.""   My husband, when the next mattress purchase came along, knew he wanted a tempurpedic (sp?) because he had enjoyed them in hotels. We went to the showroom, went through their ""diagnostics"" about how you sleep, where your pressure points are, etc. Tried all the variations.  WENT HOME to talk it over and think about it.  I guess the main thing is to consider your budget; shop around; ask about ""satisfaction"" warrantees - how long do they give you to try the mattress out and send it back if it does not work for you?  Be a top-drawer consumer and try a hundred mattresses if you need to. Sooner or later one will say, ""AHHHHH!"" to you. But always give yourself 24 hours to think before you buy. (Me, I would go back to the sleep number because I like sleeping on a cloud. My spouse seems to like sleeping on the sand, which is what memory foam feels like to me.) That's my 2 cents anyway. Good luck!"
howto,30vf8v,spsprd,2,Tue Mar 31 02:06:44 2015 UTC,"Buying a mattress has changed dramatically within the last 18 months compared to what it used to be. Within the last year or so the online mattress industry has exploded. You can now find mattresses that'd cost you $2-4K in a store (Sealys, Tempurpedic, etc.) for less than $1K online.  I actually just ended months of research shopping for a new mattress. I ended up buying a Leesa mattress. I did a ton of research before I came to this decision. I've included a few of the sites that helped me below and linked some of the better reviews too (just in case they help).  Leesa - hybrid mattress made from Avena (a latex alternative) and memory foam, good quality, inexpensive, just one of the better made online mattresses  Casper - one of the bigger names you see around online, they were one of the earlier players. Little bit softer than Leesa, great option if you want something softer, but has thinner comfort layer...so it can feel firmer to some (especially if you are larger guy / gal)  Tuft & Needle - one of the cheapest online mattress options. Also, a good bit firmer than most others. Great option if budget is critical or you just want a firmer mattress.  Yogabed - one of the newer players, only launching within the last few months. Good mattress with nice extras (free pillows).  Saatva - one of the only innerspring mattresses online, pretty decent price. Nice option if you really want to stick with an innerspring.   Nature's Sleep - a traditional whole sale mattress shop that now does online, super high quality, a bit higher end, and not as great in terms of trial / returns, but really good value if you know what you want (or you can try one in a store and buy online)  The best site I came across while doing my research was Sleeopolis. TON of great reviews and comparison reviews (I linked some of the best ones above). Super helpful and lots of good information. Has some good generic buying / shopping guides also.   Consumer Reports also has some good high-level info to get started.  Also, here's a short article that has a really quick get started guide.   Hope this helps."

My problem is that I usually forget about it, so I just set it a medium (electric range/stove) and it gets the job done.

The next best way is to swirl the cards around on the table for one minute, where you lay the cards out face down and just move them around like crazy with your hands.  The third best way is to riffle shuffle for about 7 times, and the way that is fairly ineffective is to overhand shuffle (where you grab a blob of cards and stick it randomly into the deck).  This method is ineffective because it would take 10,000 shuffles to truly randomize a deck.    TL;DR:  Just riffle shuffle about 7 times if you don't care.  Or if you really don't care, then buy a card shuffler."
howto,3099qc,GooglesYourShit,7,Wed Mar 25 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"They didn't really address what I do, which if the riffle shuffle followed by the overhand shuffle (usually 5-7 times). The purpose of the overhand shuffle is to more effectively shuffle the top and bottom of the deck and also to distribute the cards in the deck further in a short time, while the riffle randomly moves the card say +-5 cards away. I hope that made sense - I just felt it wasn't addressed."

As the wheels turn the rubber part gripes one of the card at the bottom of the top deck and push it to the center and it falls below  because there are 2 decks of cards they'd end up putting cards into the middle deck in the bottom alternately. it works a lot like the riffle shuffle, but you don't end up bending the cards so often that it destroys them"
howto,3099qc,Duckism,2,Wed Mar 25 16:04:45 2015 UTC,"Lol, randomness at its finest:  (from an amazon review)   about 5% of the time a card will be flipped upside down about 15-25% of the time a few cards will get stuck on either side (we didn't notice at first and realized that we had played a few hands without 52 cards. this is really bad if you play with identical decks) you need to put it in 4-5 times (cutting each time) to get a good shuffle. We tested this by putting all 52 cards in sequential and suit order.   Edit: line breaks"

Also, this is almost certainly faster than any of the other truly random methods, at least once you get the hang of it."

If so, it's just a projector and touch interface connected to a computer, so what you mean by ""control"" is a little hazy.   If you're just looking for a way to control the mouse/keyboard from your phone then I'd recommend ""Remote Droid"" as an app that can run on an Android phone, but it needs to have a java applet running on the PC as well.  If you're looking for a way to have the Smart Board hooked into the phone itself then no, not until Smart Tech releases software designed for the phone's operating system, and even then you'll need to convert the USB input to microUSB and the video input to microHDMI, so it will likely never happen.   All that being said, if you're just a freshman in high school looking to fuck with your teacher (likeliest scenario) then no, there is no way to control a Smart Board from your phone, and you would be better served paying attention in class."
howto,30568h,troissandwich,2,Tue Mar 24 17:32:04 2015 UTC,They actually do have wireless controls for the smart board but its using some proprietary hardware that is sold separately and doesn't usually come with the board.

howto,303oci,lablizard,7,Tue Mar 24 05:11:07 2015 UTC,Make a high density foam lined box that you can hang it in. just make sure you have a couple computer fans to exchange air. those motors get hot.
howto,303oci,Hadowkai,4,Tue Mar 24 07:51:29 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I would do.  You may even build in a baffle that jogs 90 degrees from the opening so the sound doesn't have a direct output.
howto,303oci,Jarvicious,2,Tue Mar 24 15:13:40 2015 UTC,"So I have looked up what a baffle is, but I am unsure where I could purchase one for the use you suggested. Could you explain further please"
howto,303oci,planx_constant,2,Tue Mar 24 15:52:22 2015 UTC,It's a structure to force the exiting air flow to take a different path:   Like this.  It attenuates the sound coming out of it.
howto,303oci,Jarvicious,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:42:37 2015 UTC,"Planx's image is a good example.  If you want to build a box, you can do something like this.  The small hole at the bottom (or wherever you drill it, depending on your booth setup) can be used for the flex shaft.  The baffle I drew up is just a quick example, but the gist is that you want to divert the sound waves.  Coating the inside of the container with carpet or other sound diverting material will help immensely as will isolating the vibration of the Dremel from the box itself with a spring or something of that nature.  Since Dremels get hot as hell, you'll definitely need to incorporate air flow of some sort or else you'll fry your brushes and/or motor.  Since it sounds like you travel around offering your services it might be handy to build the box as a materials transport as well.  Pack all your stuff into the enclosure until you get to the show, un pack and set up, then use the storage box to contain the sound from the motor.    Depending on how handy you are and what you have lying around, you can build a simple box and baffle and make it as pretty as you want or as ugly.  Plankx's design would be doable with one of these.  They're relatively cheap at any hardware store and you could buy some other thin material (thin plywood, rigid foam insulation, etc) to make the semi-circular baffles out of.  Again, I know my dremel gets hot as hell to the point where I have to put it down sometimes so make sure you incorporate air flow."

howto,303oci,drive2fast,2,Tue Mar 24 14:55:11 2015 UTC,the way the flexible drive works is the motor must be above the bit. That is the exact thing I have :)

howto,303oci,Zbignew2,2,Tue Mar 24 16:00:46 2015 UTC,"yes per the instructions that is how the motor powers the inside wire. Sadly I am not very good at determining the why, but when the bit is raised above the motor the bit stops rotating at the correct speed or stops. There's an inside wire that drives the bit from the rotary, perhaps it is how the adaptor fits within the nossel"
howto,303oci,Zbignew2,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"It's more likely to be the bend radius of the wire than the height. The wire is essentially a tightly wound spring, IIRC at the head end it's turned into square section to engage with the Dremel, which give it a little axial movement without disengaging. As the bend radius gets tight the spring starts to bind against the sheath and it winds up and snaps free, the same thing happens on older car speedos leading to wobbly speedo needles.   There might be another reason but I can't think of one."

They're usually a joke to bypass using a number of different techniques... and even a novice like me with some homemade lockpicks can figure out how to open a regular kwikset deadbolt within a few minutes just by knowing the basics of lockpicking.  Barring that though, doors and shit aren't really reinforced so if the lock holds, well chances are your frame isn't... that little 1/4"" of wood behind that deadbolt isn't going to do much.  a kick or two to that spot is the best technique - lean into it, use your whole foot, flat.  If you need something to be secure, you need to make sure that everything's reinforced with steel plates, have everything hardwood or better, and use a respectable lock - think the ones where the keys say 'do not copy', like medeco.    tldr;  don't even bother putting a chain lock on a door, I think you're dumb if you use one.  edit; oh and to top it all off, this only works on a door with a handle - if you've got a doorknob like many many people... welll yeah."

Few hours, very accurate, not free: Use one of those work for hire services. Amazon has a service that'll let you outsource the transcription job for $1-2/min. Split the audio file into smaller chunks and have 14-15 people work it in parallel. Then, piece it back together in Word.  It'll probably cost you around $20-30."
