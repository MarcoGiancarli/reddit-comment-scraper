Sure, the LX521 may not be something a person in Floyd Toole and Harman's school of thought really admires, but Linkwitz is a colossus in his own right.  Agreed on his comments about Dayton. They do great budget stuff, but the Scandinavians are near-unbeatable for extreme consistency. Linkwitz's custom specifications also guarantee the driver will not get revised to such an extent as to invalidate his crossover. It'd be a tad more difficult to communicate that to the Oriental manufacturers (Aurum Cantus' AC130 being an extreme example of huge changes made silently). I wouldn't change the design by Linkwitz myself.  EDIT: Really? Downvotes for someone that made the effort to try out speakers from one of the biggest names in the audio world?"
audiophile,3e30bl,ilkless,5,Tue Jul 21 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it, I was a little surprised by downvotes too. Maybe it was from people who wanted a ""to;dr""?  Anyway, I totally agree that the way I ""should"" go is to build them as designed. Still, I do own a good measurement microphone and have access to an oscilloscope and function generators, so it's mighty tempting to build the top half right now and then put it on top of a big old 15"" or 18"" woofer that won't have to move as much. I could probably get enough of that for under $300... But they do say ""a poor man pays twice"". So unless I thought I could sell those woofers later or got an insane deal on them, it's just adding to the final cost of what the system will eventually run me.  Anyway, I can keep chewing on it for a little bit and watch for sales because I really didn't have this in my budget right now."

audiophile,3e30bl,ilkless,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"As an Oriental myself, I feel it is fair game to say that ;)  In all seriousness, I meant it as a general term that encapsulates the worst practises of established driver companies in the Oriental sphere (AC in China, Dayton from Taiwan and so on) of things like silent revisions that majorly affect the driver. The AC130 example I used had 10Hz deeper bass extension in the same box between revisions. Yes, that's thankfully a good thing, but it could have just as easily thrown off the original bass alignment with such major silent revisions and no one would be the wiser for it until they measure it. Linkwitz is considering that as consistency of parameters for his design is even more crucial than box designs."
audiophile,3e30bl,MartyReasoner,0,Tue Jul 21 23:03:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying.

If you have the space to set it up properly, dipole bass is the best. The way it interacts with the room is much more natural than a boxed woofer."
audiophile,3e30bl,LoveLifeLiberty,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"You brought me out for my first post on audiophile. I am very jealous of you, I have spent countless hours and days reading through that mans work. I'm wondering how dipole would compare sound quality wise to infinite baffle if the space allowed. I guess that's a question for the man himself maybe as not to many would have the spchance to compare such things. Thank you for the write up!"
audiophile,3e30bl,LoveLifeLiberty,2,Tue Jul 21 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I can tell you a bit about it based on my understanding, and the discussion that we had.   The one thing that he kept emphasizing is that the LX521 is a machine to produce a three dimensional sound field with a specific polar response. Its job is to give you a specific proportion of directly radiated sound and reflected sound. The reflected sound is delayed and lower in level, and for psychoacoustic reasons helps the speakers disappear into the room. The really important part of that for mids and highs is that the frequency response is similar and continuous in the polar domain. That means that unlike a speaker that has a crossover where a midwoofer is already beaming, all of the drivers are operating in a bandwidth where they are small compared to the wavelength of the frequencies they produce. The figure eight pattern of the polar response is caused by dipole cancellation, not interference from driver size or spacing. This allows the indirect sound to have the same character as the direct sound, which makes it seem very natural.   The problem with an infinite baffle is that (for most designs) the distance from the driver to the first reflecting object is not really sufficient for that delay that allows your ears to separate the sound, and the sound has not traveled far enough to fall off in intensity without aggressive room treatment. All of what I just said is my interpretation of it, and I'm not sure he would agree with me on every part of it.  What I am a lot more sure of is that he would point out that the infinite baffle bass operates as a monopole, and will activate room resonances. The frequency response will have dips and peaks, and energy will be stored and create boominess. I think he would be totally on board with infinite baffle bass below the room mode frequencies, but I don't think that sub-sub-bass is really his top priority.  He mentioned some horn speakers while we were talking, and said that although their image had very good separation, it was like everything is too close to you, like the singer is right in your face. I think that he described it as a problem of not enough indirect or reflected sound, and that apparently makes it too much like you are just wearing headphones."
audiophile,3e30bl,ilkless,2,Tue Jul 21 21:02:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly that makes perfect sense. I had massive acoustical treatments for my ib and of course I did the eq for flat response, although it was never boomy in the way that conventional subs are especially depending on placement. The bass from the ib was never overwhelming although statistically all there, rather effortless all the way down to 6 hz. I believe you maybe right that having both would be the way to go, dipole for the organic bass and ib for maximum impact and organ music."
audiophile,3e30bl,ilkless,2,Tue Jul 21 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely! If you crossed over to IB around 20 or 25 hz (depending on the room) then the sound could be absolutely bonkers. It could reduce woofer excursion too, helping you hit higher volumes without worrying about bottoming out.  I have to say, we only made it to about 95db for a second, but it was so clean and clear. I have no doubt that the 3-way top panels could melt your face off."
audiophile,3e30bl,ilkless,2,Tue Jul 21 21:28:23 2015 UTC,What sort of amplifiers was he using?
audiophile,3e30bl,downhiller2010,2,Tue Jul 21 22:06:50 2015 UTC,"I can answer that for him: Linkwitz's favourite are the amplifiers from Amplifier Technologies Inc. US-made, bulletproof and no-nonsense. Yes, they are a tad more expensive than Emotivas (which he also uses), but they also outperform them in some key aspects like distortion at low powers (which Linkwitz prioritizes) and especially signal-noise ratio.  To illustrate: their XPA-5 equivalent (AT2005/3005 - forgot) has around 3kVA worth of transformers whilst the XPA has 1.2kVA with something like less than half the power supply capacitance for the XPA.  Exact model is the AT6012 in this case."
audiophile,3e30bl,OJNeg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:14 2015 UTC,I can see why he prioritizes performance at low power- splitting up the signal four ways lets the individual amps coast along with hardly any output while making some very nice sound.

audiophile,3e37oa,ss0889,14,Tue Jul 21 19:07:51 2015 UTC,"Why does anyone do/fear anything?  You say this like it's universally true.  I am an audiophile and I use ABX testing.  ABX testing is great because it lets you subjectively compare things.  As an audiophile I dislike objective measurements (as the only source of decision) because I cannot even begin to correlate how objective measurements will ultimately impact my enjoyment of a given product.  For example, I am relatively certain that my tube amp objectively measures greater distortion than some other solid state amp, but from an ABX test I prefer the sound from the tube amp which is why it's actually the amp that I own and use.  Somebody else may disagree and prefer the solid state.  That's great, audio is subjective and that right there demonstrates some of the limitations of objective measurements.  They are useful sure, but they are not gospel.  Sorry I brought in another unrelated point of discussion, but it seemed to fit into my thought about ABX and ultimately why I ABX.  Trying to go off what OP is asking.  I think the reason I have dislikes ABX sometimes is in the way some people use the results.  I see people who maybe post results from a study or post their own results of say ABX 320K MP3 vs FLAC.  Then they try to use those results to apply to everyone.  No, the results of the ABX test do not show that nobody can tell a difference between MP3 and FLAC.  They only show that the specific people who were chosen and on the gear they were using cant tell a difference.  ABX is good for self-testing, but it's not really meaningful to try to apply ABX results to other people and to other gear that was not a part of the test at all."

They only show that the specific people who were chosen and on the gear they were using cant tell a difference.   A while ago I read somewhere, that judging from many ABX tests, humans with normal hearing capabilities cannot differ between the two. Though there were people who could make out a reliable difference, but it was discovered that they didn't have normal hearing (in the sense that their ears functioned a bit differently with other strong and weak points than a normal ear)."
audiophile,3e37oa,MeisterEder,3,Tue Jul 21 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I have used specific compression artifacts to distinguish between MP3 and FLAC when I try to ABX them.  Compression artifacts like pre-echo.  I don't really think it takes special hearing to identify a pre-echo artifact for example but maybe there is more to it.  I always tended to think that it was just people who are less critical listeners and people who don't have a lot of critical listening experience who find it harder to distinguish between the two.  Being able to distinguish between MP3 and FLAC in my experience is an ability that can be learned as it requires listening for very specific things that show up in and around very specific parts of audio.  If you are simply listening ""randomly"" and don't know what to listen for, it's very easy to miss.  Also if you are not familiar with the particular track being tested it can be significantly harder to tell the difference as you don't really know how the lossless is ""supposed"" to sound.  So it's hard to know which one is ""correct"".  Being able to determine which one sounds like the correct one that you learned ahead of time allows you to know which is the lossless and which is the lossy immediately."

audiophile,3e37oa,daermonn,3,Tue Jul 21 20:12:18 2015 UTC,Essentially it's where a quieter version of a sound is heard before it was supposed to be heard.

My 595s benefited from a headphone amplifier. It drew out some of the bass that just having it connected to my source didn't present.   This is why it is typically recommended that you listen to a pair of headphone before you buy them with the type of music that you intend to listen to the most on them. I don't know if you did this or not, but I made this mistake by buying my 595s off of amazon without ever hearing them.

I frequently used to set my wall a fraction below full 0 dBFS in order to compensate for any potential inaccuracies in either my system or the playback system.

The issue of the ""loudness wars"" and overall reduced dynamic range in modern recordings is not attributable to what you're describing here.  ""Clipping"" is also a different thing. True clipping, where the waveform is squared off for a good number of samples, sounds terrible and stands a good chance of frying your tweeters, your amps or both."

For example, if you upgrade from an amp that has noticeable distortion at loud volumes to an amp that has less distortion.  If you upgrade to powered speakers, you don't need to buy another amp.  As for building a 2.1 system, there are dozens of ways to set this up depending on what equipment you already have or how you want your setup to look like.

audiophile,3e3s7v,bengeek12,4,Tue Jul 21 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"Here's my sound advice: If you really want a set of speakers for the price of a one hour massage or a full tank of petrol, look for whatever the second hand market has to offer. New speakers in that price-range are nowhere near what anyone on /r/audiophile would recommend. Here's my /r/audiojerk advice: If that's your budget for home audio, you should consider singing yourself. I can't look into your wallet but chances are you spend more on your TV then that. If you are serious about audio (what I always assume on this sub), audio deserves the same budget."

audiophile,3e19s7,jstbuch,8,Tue Jul 21 04:37:24 2015 UTC,"Do you think it will be noticeable if the right and left are using two different speakers?   Yes.   Should I just replace both of them?    Yes, if you can't get one of them to work."
audiophile,3e19s7,complex_reduction,6,Tue Jul 21 06:34:58 2015 UTC,"Grab a multimeter and make sure the impedance is roughly the same on both speakers. If the broken one is too far out of spec, it's really not that much work to open it up and check the components.   Crossovers are made from coils (L), capacitors (C), and resistors (R).  Coils really don't go bad, so you can assume they're working fine. Resistors can easily be checked with a multimeter to make sure they're in spec.  Caps can and will go bad; electrolytics especially. Any fluid leakage is a sign of failure, so if you see any of that, go ahead and replace them.  It might be tempting to upgrade to metalized polypropylene caps, but doing so can change the sound of the speaker.   If a driver is blown, you may be able to find direct replacement ones; check with infinity.  If not, you my be able to find parts that are close enough.  However, drivers are meant to work with a particular crossover, baffle width, and cabinet volume - tossing any old driver that fits will almost always change the character of the sound, and it's very unlikely the change will be an improvement.  Can it be done anyway? Sure.  But by the time you've gotten satisfactory results, it will have been far cheaper and easier to just buy another complete set of speakers.   obligatory plug for /r/diyaudio"

audiophile,3e19s7,turkphot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:16:29 2015 UTC,I mean the volume itself is just very low.  Maybe half of what the other speaker is.

So, I ""think"" the only ones sound should be coming from are the tweet and the main speaker, right?   If that is the case, there is sound coming from the main speaker but it is just really low volume.  Not whisper low but maybe a quarter to half the volume of the other speaker. You can still hear it clearly.  Did I answer the question or am I totally off here lol?  Thank you so much for the help!"
audiophile,3e19s7,nomnommish,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"No worries, you are doing perfectly.  Some questions that might sound stupid, but sometimes are not:  Are both speakers firmly and securely connected to the amplifier/receiver and to the speakers?  Are you completely sure, that both speakers get the same signal (e.g. balance pot on the amplifier)?  If you disconnect the wires from the left speaker and connect it to the right and vice versa. But leave the wires on the amp the same. Is it still the same speaker that plays on lower volume?"
audiophile,3e19s7,SQnotpoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:15 2015 UTC,"I went home at lunch and tried a few of the things suggested here.  It appears to actually be a faulty tweeter.  I didn't realize it could reduce that sound that much but I took the tweeter out of the good speaker and put it in the bad speaker and it worked perfectly.  I also took the tweeter from the bad speaker and put it in the good speaker and got the result I was getting from the bad speaker.    So, part ordered and hopefully that is that.  I really appreciate the help.  I am sort of a junker (I love antiques) and have always passed over the stereo stuff but I started with a small vinyl set up in February and now I am hooked.  I will probably start buying more of this stuff.  Not a huge score but the tweeter will cost me $18 shipped so not a bad set of speakers at all for $48 to serve as my bedroom speakers.  The cabinets aren't terrible but I am considering doing a light sand job on them.  Would that be an awful idea?  Also, are there any books I can read on basic stereo repair that's written for morons?  Browsing the forums is helpful and the feedback and help from others is awesome but I would love to learn more on my own.  Thanks again!  (and I will visit the diyaudio section!)"

Something like this for $28:  http://www.amazon.com/Panlong-Converter-Extractor-Splitter-De-embedder/dp/B00ISQ8VB8  So the chain would look like:  Apple TV -> HDMI in to Extractor -> HDMI out to TV and coax/optical/RCA out to soundbar  If using a 2 way or 4 way switch, the chain would look like: Apple TV and XBox -> (HDMI in to) HDMI switch -> HDMI out to TV and Coax/optical/RCA out to Soundbar.   I was using these switches and then later upgraded to a receiver.  Edit: Wanted to add that with a HDMI switch, you toggle between your two inputs from the HDMI switch remote (usually a credit card sized remote) - instead of using your TV to toggle between the two HDMI inputs. Bonus: Your TV's second HDMI input gets freed up. And really, this is what a receiver does, except it costs a lot more, and takes up a lot more space."

audiophile,3dxvt4,themustardtiger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:30 2015 UTC,I recently purchased a pair of AKG K550s and I feel I need an external DAC as I get a decent amount of static through the headphones ports. I was looking at the Modi 2 DAC but have a question about the output impedance. The AKGs have an input impedance of 32 ohms while the Mobi is listed with an output impedance of 75 ohms. I've read on various sources that you want a DAC output which is 1/8th the input impedance. Should i like for a DAC with a lower impedance? Would an amp be beneficial as well? Would like to keep the price under $150
audiophile,3dxvt4,slowsound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:41 2015 UTC,The Modi is designed to be used with an amp as well. Typically the stack would be the Modi and Magni.  Another popular option is this: http://www.amazon.com/FiiO-E10K-Headphone-Amplifier-Black/dp/B00LP3AMC2

Parasound High Current Power Amplifier, Model HCA-800II: effortlessly pushing 300 watts of clean undistorted power. This is the real deal in quality components. $300.00. Paradigm Model 9se MkII speakers: standing 30 inches high and weighing a solid 45 lbs each, these beautiful, furniture-quality, top of the line speakers will fill ANY room with clean, undistorted sound at ANY volume. Throw out the sub, these speakers pack their own bass. $300.00 for the pair. NHT Super Zero model bookshelf speakers: stunning sound in a compact (""5x6x9"", 6 lb each) package these are perfect as rear speakers in a large room or solo in a small room. NHT have long been at the forefront of delivering beautiful sound in small packages. $125.00 for the pair.    Dude says he can give it all for (EDIT) $600 as a package deal. Around 110 lbs of stuff. Used but in good condition on the outside and apparently perform ""flawlessly.""  How does this sound to you guys? Is it a good deal to pick up?

audiophile,3dxvt4,jackdriper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"Take a look at Ebay's completed listings search (under advanced search) when looking at used gear. It'll give you a range of about what something's worth.   Based on that, $300 is a decent price for all that assuming it's in working condition. Unless you're worried about space, I'd probably just go with the Paradigm and offer like $100 for them, looking to settle around $150. Then buy like an Emotiva Mini-X or some other modern amp. Vintage amps can be awesome, but you take the risk of old components and, frankly, new amps are great and cheap.  Regardless of what you get, listen to it before buying."
audiophile,3dxvt4,iTrollYhu,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, absolutely agree on hearing the things actually work before buying them.  I'm pretty concerned about the space though, but I'm really sure that the speakers won't really take up any huge amount of space at all. However, I would like to get a setup in my room first instead of in the family room as that room has a really odd setup and the whole middle of the home is open and there's a lot of space there, so I'm not sure how well things would even sound there.  Modern amp sounds good. I just want to try and get some relatively good stuff for cheap to start out and then spend the money first for the smaller stuff.  Messed up on the package price, all the stuff is actually $600, oopsie. I feel like this guy might consider $100 a lowball, but that's probably good advice."
audiophile,3dxvt4,jackdriper,3,Tue Jul 21 02:27:53 2015 UTC,"Ooh, $600 is a bit much. Fortunately for us (well, until we start selling our stuff), older gear is pretty cheap and this guy is asking for a lot. Give a lowball a shot, but don't be surprised if he doesn't take it well. I think a lot of us value our gear more than it's worth, at least in a capitalist sense of the word.  Paradigm makes great stuff and if you're looking for big, yet clear, sound those are a great option. Probably won't be a good choice for use at a desk though.  The Super Zeros are well regarded, but I've always been a bigger-is-better kind of person so never gave them a shot. $125 is a very fair price if you check them out and like them (but always negotiate!)."

audiophile,3dxvt4,Termy56,2,Tue Jul 21 01:37:04 2015 UTC,"I am also considering the worst case scenario with the 10k. What I have seen is that I can get a very reasonable setup for much less.

Edit: I am working with the company that is doing the pre-wire setup. They seem very open to the hardware options. I wired the house Cat6, since gigabit internet is available in my area; and they were reasonable in the price upgrade from cat5e. They seem like awesome people that I wouldn't mind spending extra with to help their company based on their price points and great customer service."
audiophile,3dxvt4,zim2411,4,Tue Jul 21 02:11:07 2015 UTC,"I take it you doing new construction? Something to consider would be installing a whisper clip system if you want to acoustically isolate the home theater room from the rest of your house.  Here's what I'd consider if you're building new:   Acoustically transparent screen - Around $1200 depending on how big/what variety you want Sony VPL-HW40ES - $2500 new, I think you can find them for ~$2000. We are on the verge of 4K projectors becoming affordable (currently the lowest priced true 4K model is ~$9k from Sony.) The HW40ES is pretty much as good as 1080p gets now and is great for gaming and movies. Hopefully in a few years if you want to upgrade, you should be able to sell this for $1000 and get a $3k-$5k 4K resolution laser based projector. This will be the only component that really gets outdated quickly, so I wouldn't spend more than this now.  For the receiver, I'd go with a Marantz SR5010. The only thing better would be going with standalone amp(s) and a processor which is a lot more expensive. (But the XMC-1 does have Dirac Live room correction which is mind blowingly good) For speakers, hmm. For a home theater you really want wide dispersion to expand the sweet spot, so it's not just one person in the middle with great audio and everyone else is meh. If your primary goal is home theater with music secondary, it might be worth considering Power Sound Audio's lineup. The MT-110 will play seriously loud, and /u/ZeosPantera quite liked them in his review. 3 of those for the front stage, and two V1500 subwoofers will run you $3500 for speakers but they should handle anything you throw at them for years to come. For the bipolar surrounds, I think this is the cheapest you can get. I have a pair and they are decent.   Hope that helps! You've got a very nice budget for gear, so you'll probably find a lot of opinions on what gear to get thrown your way. If you can demo anything in person, that may help narrow choices down. (But honestly, with how advanced room correction software is these days, as long as you get speakers that will handle the power you need you can basically get any sound signature you want.)  Also, you may want to have them pre-wire in-ceiling speakers too while you're at it. Dolby Atmos and DTS:X are the newest audio formats that include overhead speakers in the recommended setups."

At very low volumes the balance shifts incorrectly, and the right side is way quieter, but that's at volumes far lower than I'd normally listen to anyway. The volume knob is a little dirty on mine now having owned it for a year, and it crackles a tiny bit when I adjust the volume. Other than that it's fine with my Sennheiser Momentums (first gen over ear.) The bass boost knob is pretty pointless IMO as it makes things sound very muddy."

I'm in a temporary living situation for a few months and need something to cover me since I wont want to be shipping anything back across the country. Preferably the $100-$150 range. I've been checking out the Mackie CR3s but am a bit afraid of the lack of bass response if anyone knows about these. Since I'll mostly be just getting by bedroom DJing till I'm back to me real setup they wont need to be amazing of course. But a better low end would be much appreciated."

audiophile,3dwoba,Skumcat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:11:14 2015 UTC,The lower the frequency the more you need to displace the driver to produce the same SPL.
audiophile,3dwoba,complex_reduction,6,Tue Jul 21 00:51:28 2015 UTC,"The subwoofer need to move air to produce sound. And to make a meaningful sound pressure below 20Hz requires a very large speaker cone. One that will be impractical for a living room.

audiophile,3dwoba,complex_reduction,8,Mon Jul 20 08:16:55 2015 UTC,"What?  Good subwoofers will play below 20Hz. That's half the point of a subwoofer.  As for why 8"" subwoofers can't play 5Hz, the answer is physics."
audiophile,3dwoba,TVodhanel,2,Mon Jul 20 04:00:23 2015 UTC,"Well 8"" drivers can reproduce 5 Hz, it'd just be much quieter than say a 15"". But I haven't come across any subwoofers which seem to output anything below 20 Hz when running line level preamp output into the built in subwoofer amplifier.. I know that the same 8"" driver I tested hooked directly to the speaker level outputs of a cheap amp could reproduce 5 Hz. But when I ran the line level output from my computer into the line level input on the subwoofer amplifier it wouldn't handle anything below 20 Hz. And I've found this to be the case with every subwoofer I've tested."
audiophile,3dwoba,complex_reduction,5,Mon Jul 20 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"The driver might be able to theoretically reproduce 5Hz, but it couldn't do it once installed in an enclosure.    But I haven't come across any subwoofers which seem to output anything below 20 Hz when running line level preamp output into the built in subwoofer amplifier   I don't understand this at all. There are hundreds of subwoofers that play just fine below 20Hz. Here's a plot of my subwoofer (SVS PB-2000) playing at full volume down to ~12Hz in my listening room. It's rated to 17Hz anechoically (without any room reinforcement) and this is not even a ""high end"" subwoofer. SVS' top end subwoofer (PB13 Ultra) is rated to 14Hz without room reinforcement.  A subwoofer is like any other speaker, it will play whatever you send to it (as long as it's capable of doing so)."
audiophile,3dwoba,turkphot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:42 2015 UTC,"20hz is fairly common these days with the better woofs. In room, even 10hz isn't that hard to find if you are willing to spend $750-$1500 for example. 5hz or lower....THAT'S difficult..:)   In the deeper bass it is just a matter of displacement. Each time you drop an octave on a sealed woof you need 4x the air displacement to maintain the same SPL(volume). so going from 80hz to 40hz to 20hz to 10hz to 5hz?  The woofer needs to move 256x further to maintain the same volume."

Well that's kind of why I made this post. When running the signal through an amplifier only, the speaker reproduces the 5 Hz tone. When running the signal through the subwoofer's amplifier and crossover network the driver does nothing. I tested this with the driver in an enclosure and outside of the enclosure. This means that the subwoofer has a built in limitation in the crossover network or in the amplifier."
audiophile,3dwoba,ssl-3,5,Mon Jul 20 04:47:31 2015 UTC,This means that the subwoofer has a built in limitation in the crossover network or in the amplifier.   Yes. They all do. Because otherwise the driver would explode.

audiophile,3dwoba,mpelleg459,4,Mon Jul 20 05:02:49 2015 UTC,it's the crossover network which limits the output frequency   You answered your question yourself. These are your words in the OP.
audiophile,3dwoba,Interlang,5,Mon Jul 20 06:20:16 2015 UTC,"Chances are, the driver's resonant frequency is above 20Hz (if you find an 8"" driver with an Fs below 20Hz, call me), and the cabinet is a ported cabinet. Sending the driver a tone below 20Hz in this case would simply cause the driver to ""unload"" and move peak-to-peak, unable to move enough air one way or another to reproduce the tone. The amplifier built into the cabinet accounts for this and has a hard cutoff at that frequency to minimize distortion this creates when trying to produce multiple tones, some audible and some infrasonic.  Getting he sub to play lower would either require a substantially larger cabinet or a substantial drop in efficiency, and almost certainly a larger driver. Adding an infrasonic filter is one of the few ways to keep a ported subwoofer from unloading like that; sealed designs won't unload, and therefore wouldn't need a filter, but would either need an immense cabinet, or would need to be isobarically loaded, would would still net a pretty goddamned big cab."
audiophile,3dwoba,AiryDiscus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:43:55 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of ""handling,"" or a physical limitation.  It's simply a design feature of the particular amplifier used in a particular powered sub."

audiophile,3dvwsa,Akaanonymous,5,Sun Jul 19 23:45:00 2015 UTC,"Wow. The only guy who was right, is the only one downvoted.  This is a DAC and HEADPHONE AMP. Why is everyone talking about double amping the speakers? If you connect it to the rear 'line-out' port on the back, it is not amplified. It is serving only as a DAC and sending the signal to your power amp, or in this case the speakers.  So basically, as long as you don't connect it to the front headphone port, you're all good.  Source: I own this DAC"
audiophile,3dvwsa,quadfreak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:43:55 2015 UTC,"Even the front headphone jack can be okay.  The input impedance of the LSR308 is probably > 1000 ohms, so the amp will not exceed 2V rms."
audiophile,3dvwsa,AiryDiscus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"Bi amping is quite different. It is about using two amps to power the tweeters and bass drivers individually.  You have instead powered/active monitors that basically need a preamp output, typically via rca or xlr.  And your Fiio dac is basically a preamp so you can use the rca out and connect it to the rca in of your speakers. Or use a rca to xlr converter.  The only thing to watch out for is gain and impedance matching. What you refer to as biamping, which is feeding a power amp output to another power amp - that should never ever be done!"
audiophile,3dvwsa,nomnommish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:27:32 2015 UTC,You can flip the pro level sensitivity(+4dBu) switch on the back of the speakers to take up some of the slack. As long as you don't over drive the speakers they will be fine.
audiophile,3dvwsa,strategicdeceiver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:56:44 2015 UTC,"For best results, don't feed your speakers an amplified signal. A Line Level signal is best."
audiophile,3dvwsa,justanotherdickweed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:37:18 2015 UTC,"You're amping in series. Use your Fiio to bring it up to a volume closest to Line Level and then let your speakers amp to bump it up the next.  Easy way to blow your speakers is by a friend cranking the Fiio whilst the speakers are turned up high also, so tread wisely."

audiophile,3dwacz,dramsay9,2,Mon Jul 20 03:49:50 2015 UTC,"Possibly.  If it sounds like you are clipping, or they have put in a split-band limiter to cut the bass because their amplifier can't deliver a lot of bass/power, then you might get something out of hooking the headphone output of your phone to an amplifier.  If it sounds like the bass issue only happens as you turn up the volume, this might work.  If it's always present, you need to get the audio out of the phone before it touches the phone's analog circuitry.  In this case, an external amp will only help if it takes a digital stream from your phone (like bluetooth).  This is probably your best, 'catch all' solution.  There is a chance your old phone did some extra processing, like 'bass enhancement' or 'harmonic excitation' with the bass, to make it sound a little better.  I'm not sure if android has any of these tricks baked in by default, but you might want to check/cross reference your headphones with a third known, good system and reference track.  The other potential thing to look at is impedance match of the headphones to the amplifier, but your headphones are relatively low impedance (32Ohm) so I don't think that should cause any issue with a phone.  You never know what you're gonna get with a cheap phone amplifier, though.  You can get some roll-off stuff happening if there is an impedance issue.   http://www.head-fi.org/t/607282/headphone-amp-impedance-questions-find-the-answers-here"

I wouldn't be surprised if they still play some games even with the 'beats EQ' off.  Definitely check your headphones on a reference, good system that doesn't have any weird settings.  If it turns out you're missing some bass enhancement or bass limiting effect, you can probably find an app in the app store that will recreate it."

audiophile,3dujsb,crazyacid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:42 2015 UTC,"That's a really cool idea (not something you see often on audio-related kickstarters!). I'd rather see wifi than bluetooth for connectivity due to the much longer range and better reliability, but aptx is a fine alternative. And at $140 MSRP, it's barely more than an Airport Express + Lepai amp.  I'd like to see some better measurements. I can't help but think it's not going to push more than maybe 5-10 wpc before getting into to >10% distortion range, like a Lepai does. However, 10 watts is plenty of power for most listening, especially for horned speakers like they're showing off.  Despite this kickstarter's low cost, the real poor-man's wireless amp is still a Lepai for $25 and used Airport Express for $20. It's a third of the price, uses wifi and ethernet instead of bluetooth, and can be upgraded when you want to get a better amp or even a new DAC. But sometimes it's worth paying more to have everything in a nice package."

audiophile,3dtxrr,complex_reduction,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:43:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I've misunderstood the question, but why are you buying a DAC/amp if you don't have any headphones yet?

After quite a bit of research I notice no websites mention the quality of the audiocard/headphone jack/cables connecting the device to headphone jack.

We recently brought 3 more children into our home which makes it rather loud, distracting and difficult for concentration. That being said I need to find a new pair of headphones to help drown out the noise when I really need to concentrate ( my wife is home so I am not just ignoring the kids ).   The noise is coming from a 4, 6, 18 month olds, and a 6 year old. In the past when I worked in a loud office space I used 800 mhz wireless headphones turned up with ear plugs in. It seemed to work pretty well and I wouldn't mind going that route again. For this purchase I was debating over noise isolating & noise cancelling. I had originally thought about getting noise cancelling but it doesn't seem they would work well in this application so I started looking into noise isolating. Would love to hear what your opinion on this.  I am looking for a pair of headphones which you think would work well for my situation. I am looking to keep the cost under 200$ and preferably under 100$. I am not sure about noise isolating or cancelling so I am interested to see your opinion. Wireless is a must possibly Bluetooth so it can easily hook up to my laptop/cellphone. I often have to take my system to an office, travel so the less wires I need to plugin/deal with the better. It would be really awesome if it had a mic so I could use it on call when connected to my cellphone as well.  TL;DR / Features list   Wireless, preferably Bluetooth Headphone Driver.   Laptop Bluetooth: Qualcomm Atheros AR3012 Bluetooth 4.0 Laptop Soundcard: Realtek high def sound can't find the specifics of the actual card. Cellphone: Samsung Galaxy S3  Microphone would be great to take calls on Cellphone Noise Cancelling or Noise Isolating ( Cancel out / Block out small children ) Under 200$ preferably around 100$ or less   Thanks in advance I appreciate any recommendations given as I really need to figure something out soon."

I was asking if i Passive Pre-Amp is what i was needing.   I currently just have a set of 5.1 speakers hooked up to my TV but since they are computer speakers they dont have a remote control and its quite annoying to have to change the volume by hand.  For some reason the output from my TV stays at a static volume and no matter what you do you cant change it.    Basically im just trying to find something that will sit between the TV and the Speakers that allows me to control the volume  I'll basically leave the knob on the speakers turned up pretty high and i just want to be able to remotely control the input of the volume going into the speakers if that makes sense.

It adds some excitement to movies without adding real bass. If you get it dialed in just right it's a cool effect.  Other than that, I'd say move the subwoofer as close to you as possible so that it doesn't have to play as loud. More importantly, talk to your neighbors and ask them if it's too loud. I did that with my new neighbors and they said that I'm super quiet! I think that I got lucky with the construction of this building, but I have a lot more peace of mind turning it up now that I have had that conversation."

audiophile,3dqhyd,fackin_samsquamch,7,Sun Jul 19 01:56:35 2015 UTC,"First of all, kudos to you for being conscious and proactive on this issue.  Full disclosure: I'm extremely biased on this topic, because I've had more than my share of clueless neighbors who didn't realize how far their bass frequencies carried, and who acted like entitled twats when I spoke to them about it.  Living in a situation where you share walls or floors/ceilings with your neighbors means you have to make some sacrifices to be a good neighbor. As long as you're in that situation, you shouldn't run a subwoofer. The sound will penetrate, no matter how hard you try to prevent it, and it can be a major quality of life issue for the neighbors. Just run without a subwoofer for now, and if you really want top quality audio, use your headphones."
audiophile,3dqhyd,wunqrh,8,Sat Jul 18 18:17:37 2015 UTC,"In order of importance:  1) Set up communication.  Talk to your neighbor and tell them what you told Reddit. Obviously you don't want to be ""that dick with the subs"" next door so give them your phone number and tell them it's perfectly acceptable for them to call or text when you're being too loud. You'll also want to ask if there are any certain times of the week/day that they really don't want you to have the woofer on (i.e. naptime if they have small children, study time if they're a student, etc...)  2) Be conscientious  Common sense should give you a decent idea of when it is appropriate to have your woofer on. Middle of the day on a weekend? Probably fine. 3 am Monday morning? Bad idea no matter who you are.  3) Utilize isolation and room treatment.  If you can get it up on isolation pads or a riser you can cut down on the mechanical vibrations and mitigate some of the subwoofer noise for your neighbor. This may also help you to have more bass in your room without the subwoofer actually having to be louder. If you have some cash on hand you may also consider adding bass traps to the corners of your room for the same reason. If bass is getting acoustically 'stuck' in corners and poorly amplified by the floorboards the quality of the audio will suffer."
audiophile,3dqhyd,Hutchinson76,4,Sat Jul 18 14:30:41 2015 UTC,"I have this dilemma. My neighbors are cool but I know they can hear it if i have it on and it can take their concentration away or draw unwanted attention to myself. I have a small sub and only listen at significant volume at daytime since there are other sounds going on at the condo, landscaping, construction, cars ,kids etc. At night, when I want to have good sound quality reaching my ears I use my headphones.   Bass sound isolation is expensive and hard to implement and sub bass from movies will travel far, and due to room modes and phase cancellations the bass will probably be louder away from the listening position. If you want to enjoy a subwoofer you need to move to a place that is not an apt building or have neighbors that also listen to music and watch movies on a system to go tit for tat. Any conflict in interests causes problems in neighbor relations.   Im lucky that my neighbors are cool and dont want  trouble but they are also really quiet and one is a visual artist and I know he needs his quiet moments of concentration. Even if they dont complain, you should be aware of who can hear your sound and how it may affect them even if they dont complain; some people are afraid to complain and they suffer in silence while you enjoy your action flicks starring vin diesel.  IMO if you live in an APT and want to enjoy high quality sound without cans from movies, go to the cinema and enjoy the monster sound system there. Living in an apart you should def put your money into a high end headphone system for audiophile quality sound that does not make you any enemies. my 3 cents  Even communicating that you are going to be loud to neighbors that are not also your friends can seem like manipulation and social engineering, not moral in my opinion. Complaints like that should happen once or twice and be done with, unless, again, you are buddies. Having them have to ask your permission to sleep or whatever can get old quick, again, unless you become friends. So try being genuinely friendly and interested in  people and you might make some friends. One of the things I miss from living in a apt building was the community and always having people to shoot the shit with.   PS some APTs are built solid and cost about the same to live in, we have some here in my area, built like a bunker."

If positioned and EQ'd properly, a 3"" speaker can have plenty of bass for listening, without shaking the wall.  It will at least be much better bass than cheesy $25 PC speakers.

Also, most signal chains will have DC protection that will drop the level at 1hz significantly.  If you design your signal chain for it, you'll likely be able to get down to about 3hz ok.  It's much easier to do this with an array of sealed subs or an IB, and they can play over a wider range.  The fan subs don't really have much of a market, they're just not very good."
audiophile,3dqes9,notnyt,2,Sat Jul 18 22:07:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly why said rotary subwoofer comes with a proprietary DC-coupled amplifier.  No, the cone won't be moving quickly, but it'll sure as hell be hitting driver-damaging excursions. The voice coil will likely hit the backplate and self-destruct.  As for an array of sealed subs, I have not seen a rig with the sort of subsonic and bottom octave distortion this subwoofer produces at high levels. Nevertheless, even the designer (Bruce Thigpen, who should be mentioned in the same breath as Keele and Geddes they all come from a physics background with some unique ideas) recognizes that physics makes cone subs much more efficient than a rotary sub above 40Hz in comparison for SPL and distortion."
audiophile,3dqes9,notnyt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:35:02 2015 UTC,"You can remove dc filter caps from your amp all you want, it doesn't mean that the rest of your gear will carry the signal, or that there's even much content in that range anyway.  Also, having a rig that could produce output way higher, 20+ db higher, and at the listening position as opposed to right in front of the sub, than a single rotary fan sub at low frequency, I can tell you there's not much going on at those super low frequencies that matter.  Aside from ""oh look, my door is bouncing back and forth in the frame"" or ""my walls are flexing"", it's very hard to perceive content that low.  It's a very slight pressurization feeling and a complete waste of time.  The only thing unique that the rotary sub brings to the table, is that it can actually reproduce (to an extent) DC output and maintain a constant pressure.  That said, there's really no audio benefit to it whatsoever.  And no, a properly designed and configured setup will not be hitting 'drive damaging excursions'.  Maybe if you're used to consumer junk.  p.s. The magico sub is laughable, you can easily best it at 1/20th the cost.  Not that it's bad, just that it's incredibly overpriced."
audiophile,3dqes9,danislous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:10:59 2015 UTC,An array won't hit such excursion. My comment was made in the context of a typical single or even dual-driver sub at high SPLs.

The exit of the manifold is smaller than the surface area of the cones so there's going to be some compression resisting the movement of the drivers. He could probably push it a few Hz lower without hitting the xmax.

I ran the sound out of my laptop's audio jack into a very compact amp and then ran speaker wire directly to the driver. It made me wonder why pretty much all subwoofers roll of so early.

Some of the ground work is done already -- the wires are routed, speakers are in the walls -- but you would have to buy new cable and amp boxes.   Crestron's Sonnex system is a good modern alternative. It's basically the same, but uses CAT5e cable. One cool advantage is that you can control it with your phone, so you don't have to worry about remote controls and associated wiring."

You could try it though and they might be fine. I would try both receivers and see what you think.  If you can't get the speakers to play very loud hooked up to the NAD without turning the volume nob up really high you might want to use the Sony amp to avoid clipping and possibly damaging the speakers.

audiophile,3drxxr,v2guy2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:54:18 2015 UTC,"There is no way to do this if you use the USB connection.  If you use the 3.5mm analogue input, the best way to accomplish this would be to buy something like a MiniDSP to act as an active crossover. http://www.minidsp.com/products/minidsp-in-a-box/minidsp-2x4  You can use the MiniDSP to (for example) send all sound <80Hz to the sub, and all sound >80Hz to the KEF X300A's. This will improve the performance of your X300A's as well as the performance of your subwoofer (since neither of them will be straining to play frequencies beyond their capabilities).  The ""meh"" option would be to just split the signal with adapters off eBay or Amazon etc. Would be a pain in the behind though since you would have to use a few different cables/adapters since the X300A's accept single 3.5mm while the subwoofer accepts dual RCA. You'd have to take the signal from the PC, split it into two, then split one of those signals into dual RCA connectors and the second signal would need to end with a stereo 3.5mm connector."

audiophile,3dqb8a,kirovreporting,2,Sat Jul 18 12:42:28 2015 UTC,"Read up on gain staging. Basically, by rearranging your gain / amplification stages you can minimize or maximise audible noise (usually hiss / stray emi, especially on unshielded / un balanced cables).   At a guess, since you said you have a hiss, as opposed to digital noise (chirping / beeping) or a ground loop (60hz noise, aka angry transformer buzz), I would bet that your new DAC is putting out a hotter signal than whatever you were using before. To adjust your gain staging, crank up any software volumes all the way, and set your hardware (probably OS) volume control to about 75%, maybe 80%. Turn down your speakers so you don't deafen yourself. Play some music, preferably something ""quiet"" (high dynamic range) and turn up the volume on the LSRs until it's as loud as you will ever want it. Then adjust volume to taste at the hardware (or OS) volume. BTW, make sure you have installed any prerequisite drivers for your DAC first.   The LSRs should have XLR inputs on the back, you should also be using gear with balanced outputs and decent XLR cables (3 conductor plus shielding in the wire). Balanced circuitry is electrically superior to unbalanced circuitry."
audiophile,3dqb8a,MrRobogoat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I checked and there are no drivers I need to install when connecting via a digital optical audio cable. I have been looking around for XLR cables and I'm unsure of what I should purchase. Would I need a dual XLR To RCA? Because currently I'm using a dual 1/4 inch to RCA."
audiophile,3dqb8a,MrRobogoat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:27:43 2015 UTC,"No. XLR is the connector, used to refer to balanced, differential drive because that's the standard connector used. Converting from RCA to XLR will not help, because the signal is still a single voltage in reference to ground. Your DAC may not have balanced outputs -- a lot of home audio gear does not bother with them, unfortunately. Focus on gain staging. The goal is to have the volume on the back of the speakers as low as is tolerable so that stray noise is amplified less (see the process I laid out in the previous comment)."

I'm currently looking at the V-Moda Crossfade m100 Over-ears. But I want to make sure There's not something better for around the same price. +50 at the most maybe so about 300 for headphones.

In regard to speakers, we don't really deal with 5.1 systems much. Very little music is mastered for 5.1, and 5.1 systems are a massive pain to properly set up.   For $500, I would recommend these: https://emotiva.com/products/powered-monitors/speakers/airmotiv-6s  Very simple. They are self-powered so no need for an amplifier etc, you just plug them in. Nice big EMT tweeter for extremely wide treble dispersion, nice big 6.5"" woofers that punch accurately down to 43Hz which should be enough for almost all music (although for hip hop / EDM /etc you are probably going to want a subwoofer at some stage)."

I just really am confused with all of this and want to understand all of the characteristics of headphones. I have DT990 Premium 250 Ohm headphones, with a Fiio E10K Olympus 2 amp that I read would be good for my headphones. I don't think that these headphones are getting enough power. Although I'm a newbie to this whole advanced headphone thing, my other headphones before (beats) seem to produce more noise as they play music. They seem louder and more of a kick? I'm not sure how to describe it but from what I've heard about the DT990s is that they produce some good bass and I'm just a bit disappointed in the sound. SO: Do I need a better DAC/Amp? Do I need just an Amp or a DAC as well? Does the Schiit Magni sound like a better option for me? BTW, this is for a home setup used with my computer I built last year- games and music. I just feel like I'm doing something wrong. They do indeed bring out some things that I've never been able to hear before, but the bass and treble and power in general seem to lack, if that makes any sense. Thanks."
audiophile,3dqdw5,complex_reduction,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:56:56 2015 UTC,"You say your last headphones were Beats. Beats are specifically designed to play the loudest possible bass while drowning out every other frequency.  It's not that your DT990's are bass light (in fact they are quite bass heavy), it's that you are likely accustomed to hearing absurdly loud bass and nothing else. Every high fidelity headphone in the world is going to sound ""bass light"" compared to Beats, because ""high fidelity"" means accurate to the music, not D-D-D-D-DROP THE BASS BWAAOOOOOWMMMM!!!!! as Dr Dre would have us believe.  That being said, the DT990's also have infamously ear-piercing treble, maybe you're unconsciously turning the volume down because it's shattering your eardrums?"

I'm pretty sure your fiio should be able to drive the beyers, 250 ohms isn't that high. Maybe just audition and few more and send them back if they don't do it for you."

audiophile,3dm6fc,meezun,3,Fri Jul 17 14:08:32 2015 UTC,"Cumulative spectral decay in the bass wouldn't be affected much, if at all, by mass loading as the bass is being produced by the pistonic movement of the cone. There is not really any resonant process except at the resonance frequency (Fs) of the driver itself as defined by Thiele and Small.  In the midrange and treble, as the cone starts to enter its breakup region, resonant modes appear on the plot as the pistonic movement of the cone transitions to a bending-wave movement at these frequencies. That is to say, instead of being pulled back and forth, the cone itself vibrates to reproduce these frequencies. The effect of mass loading would only be visible at these frequencies. This is of course irrelevant to bass reproduction/'speed'. All drivers are operating within their pistonic region from the midrange downwards with the exception of very large subwoofers with metal cones that can breakup as low as 300-350Hz."
audiophile,3dm6fc,DrXaos,5,Fri Jul 17 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"I would think that ""slow"" bass is caused by either an amplifier with insufficient damping factor or a ported cabinet with a large group delay."

audiophile,3dm6fc,strategicdeceiver,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:26:33 2015 UTC,Would using DSP filtering to add delay to the high frequency drivers help? I assume this is the point of time alignment.
audiophile,3dm6fc,strategicdeceiver,3,Fri Jul 17 14:26:33 2015 UTC,Not really relevant to what is being discussed here. The rise time of an impulse response is determined by the frequency response of the driver itself (which is itself determined by inductance).
audiophile,3dm6fc,strategicdeceiver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:31:20 2015 UTC,So the only solution is to have the proper driver/box design then?
audiophile,3dm6fc,strategicdeceiver,6,Fri Jul 17 14:34:16 2015 UTC,"In short, yes. Meanwhile, the benefit of time alignment is exactly what it says: account for the different distances the acoustic centre of non-concentric drivers is from the ear and then calculate the appropriate amount of delay such that the sound produced by each driver reaches the ear at the same time. What is less talked-about is how time alignment can only be achieved at a single listening position."

audiophile,3dm6fc,OJNeg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"Time alignment is more lobe steering that anything else.  If you want fast bass like a magnepan it's easy, turn it down. It gets real fast real quick when you turn it down about 2-3db."
audiophile,3dm6fc,OJNeg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"Care to substantiate that claim? When I think of 'fast' bass, the first connotation I think of is impulse response and CSD more than relative SPL. I assume you are talking about reducing the excitation of room modes, which is outside the ambit of this article that seeks to debunk perceptually 'fast' bass as a function of cone mass.  EDIT: To clarify, I meant your second quote about Magnepans. The first one is valid, of course."
audiophile,3dm6fc,OJNeg,2,Fri Jul 17 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"When people say a speaker has fast bass, such as a magnepan for example, or a sealed subwoofer, it's usually because the speaker is rolling off early and just not as loud as it should be. It has nothing to do with the ""speed of the driver"" or any other crap. It's just that there is a lack of bass energy, so it does not hit the room modes as hard, and then it is fast in comparison to something that lights the room modes up.  Geddes has lots of fun with the ""fast bass"" question. I remember the idea behind his argument, but the details may be a little off. He said something like this - It takes 5-10 cycles of a frequency for your brain to tell that the sound even exists, given the wave length of bass notes are very long the energy will be all over the room before you notice that it was ever there, how can there be fast or slow. For example, 50Hz is 20ms, so 5 cycles at 50Hz is 100ms before you notice that the note was played - not only is this a long time, but it's also about 100 feet of omnidirectional sloshing through the room."
audiophile,3dm6fc,strategicdeceiver,2,Fri Jul 17 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"Would love to see how Geddes arrived at that number, given that there is also the physical impact of low bass that is also felt by the skin and conducted by the bone. Not sure if all the psychoacoustic literature accounts for these other sensory responses."
audiophile,3dm6fc,OJNeg,2,Fri Jul 17 16:39:37 2015 UTC,"The nervous system is pretty slow, but makes up for it by cheating, using past experience and stored information to kind of blur time to make things seem instantaneous. In reality it's about 35ms reaction time for a touch signal to get from your hand to your brain.. from there we can assume that the processing is pretty quick.  This hazy response to physical stimulus would probably make bass speed even less relevant."
audiophile,3dm6fc,strategicdeceiver,3,Fri Jul 17 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was what I was talking about: the contribution of full-body nervous stimulus in stereo bass reproduction. We are really moving into physiology here, but the ear-brain interface is clearly only part of the story in this context. Room modes are still the elephant in the room, but I don't totally buy the argument it is the sole determinant of perceptual bass speed. There are other factors like harmonic distortion and compression on the driver's part.  I do also think toneburst performance at LF in the nearfield is another possible factor. In fact,  I think they'd shed more light than a single impulse measurement. Again, room modes still dominate though."
audiophile,3dm6fc,OJNeg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:19:44 2015 UTC,"From my experience, it's room modes - which the brain can do a lot to ignore, and the ability of the driver to make the bass frequencies of even loudness. I think that last bit is the most important. I do nothing with my room modes via dsp, and eq my sealed boxes flat to 20Hz. The bass is very good, but coverage is definitely spotty.  Even with the big subs I run I'm limited to about 105dB at 20Hz, not counting room gain. Most speakers are dealing with unequalized roll off, port chuffing, and just not enough ass to push large frequencies cleanly."
audiophile,3dm6fc,gimmebackmyracecar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as ""fast"" bass as bass by definition is a longer wavelength that is slow if you look at a step response.  Audiophiles tend to say a lot of dumb things, and while I hate to defend people's lack of technical know-how, you're not getting to the point of what they're trying to communicate. When people talk about ""fast bass"" they refer to a bass response that does not linger. A lack of stored energy basically. Some playback rigs have it, some don't. For example, when you listen to an open baffle woofer the bass does seem faster as there's no cabinet behind it to muddy things up. It does sound more live, natural, fast, etc."

Reduced excitation of room modes due to dipole cancellation would be the main factor in giving such speakers their perceptually fast bass.  I don't really believe the absence of cabinet resonance itself is the largest determinant of perceptually fast bass."
audiophile,3dm6fc,strategicdeceiver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"W.R.T. reduces room modes...that's certainly possible. Although the room modes are still there.  Highly disagree that ""less bass = fast bass"" though. Sounds like something that someone who's only played with EQ would say. With these AE Dipole15 drivers I can EQ it to be very flat and extended down to the Fs (21Hz) and it never gets slow. Put in some heavy subwoofer cone with a ported enclosure and I guarantee it's not going to sound as ""fast"" or clean or whatever terminology we want to use to denote fidelity. It's going to sound resonant and one-note. Not too far of a stretch given we know the nature of how ported enclosures work...."

audiophile,3dolqg,dannyd1999,4,Fri Jul 17 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"Drivers.... the Linux kernel has thousands of modules that allow the applications to communicate with hardware that are dynamically loaded. So... the drivers are just built right into the Linux kernel, after thousands of man-hours spent building them as part of the ALSA project. This has nothing to do with PulseAudio.   Also most audio devices at least support the PC97 standard, so I guess you could argue drivers really aren't needed in either OS.  In Windows Vista and beyond, DirectSound internally pads everything to 32 bit, manipulates and mixes it in case you have multiple audio streams running at once, and then converts it to whatever output you desire (and your hardware supports). This mixing step adds latency, and allows Flash ads to play in the background while playing a game.  The issue with ASIO and WASAPI is that its not designed for this generic mixing. Both ASIO and WASAPI are designed as special audio modes for production purposes. They need to be low latency, so you can manipulate and hear the audio stream as close to real time as possible. In order to make it as close to real time real-time as possible they cut out as much mixing and other manipulation as possible. /r/Audiophile likes this lack of manipulation, but otherwise, WASAPI/ASIO interferes with your ability to hear multiple streams at the same time. Latency doesn't really matter to /r/audiophile users...  Secondly, DirectSound has been a standard for more than a decade and most applications are designed to use it, or go into a legacy mode that eventually uses it. Currently most open-source Linux applications now point to PulseAudio, but when it first came out, audio streams would go to ALSA, then to PulseAudio, then back to ALSA, and then to module and hardware, which actually added latency. Since most Windows applications are closed source, and many are not actively developed, making WASAPI the default would probably cause applications to go App -> DS -> WASAPI -> Driver -> Hardware... which adds no latency advantage... and you'd still DS manipulation.   Really the only advantage PulseAudio brought was moving some of the audio infrastructure to userspace, allowing a little more control and stability.  Like most of what Poettering creates, PulseAudio was a solution to problems that didn't exist."

DirectSound is a software component from the DirectX library, it's not a driver, it's essentially a software made to ""communicate"" with the driver.

audiophile,3dolqg,Yolo_Swagginson,4,Sat Jul 18 14:06:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry but you're wrong. Both WDDM and UAA are driver models, or driver architectures, not a default driver. A framework that all drivers have to share, within which drivers are built. Yes, there are default WDDM and UAA drivers, but that's not the point.  Directsound is an outdated API that can nowadays only be emulated. There is no path starting with windows vista for directsound to communicate with hardware:  everything in windows is now an Audio Session, for legacy purposes, directsound sources (which multiple software still use) are emulated within a session. All sessions are processed as 32bit fp before being eventually converted down and sent to hardware. Exclusive sessions are direct to hardware instead."

Of ""decent"" gear (ie: not ""budget"" gear by must stretches of the imagination, though some makers of good gear are sure to also make budget gear):  In my own (small) hometown, we have a smattering of old/good Adcom and Rotel and Yamaha, because those are the brands that used to be sold by the small number higher-end shops that have come/gone/survived here.  Newer used non-budget examples are Parasound and a bit of Krell, with some Onkyo Integra.  And just 45 miles north in a much bigger town comes old Audio Research and H/K and Yamaha, but no Krell and no Integra.  My audiophile friend (and sometimes-installer in his market) from up there does not recognize my Krell gear, and I (also a sometimes-installer in my market) don't recognize his Audio Research gear.*  In conclusion, I don't know that it's all that ""regional"".  Every dealer strives, as they always have, to offer something unique and awesome that cannot be found nearby.  And the used market will reflect this, with softened boundaries.  For instance:  In a large and geographically-disperse greater Chicagoland area, based on the above, I'd fully expect to see a whole different set of used gear between Tinley Park and damn-near Milwaukee -- whether on CL or on the used rack of an audio shop.  *:  This makes it extra-fun and informative to critically listen to eachother's systems."

I listen to records at my pops house and love it, but for me it's an extra investment in an alternative path.   I'm running the entire system including a 1000w psu and various other prefferials on a single 15amp line . FERMAN makes a 15amp to 20amp adaptor cable. The  adaptor will trip at 13 amp to keep you from tripping your house pannel.  I've had no problems.

The XSP-1 is every bit the dream it's billed to be! Definitely no complaints with it so far, however... ... I can't say the same for the XDA-2 dac. I was going to give it a chance but after some back and forth across piano it was clear the bifrost Uber was much closer to life. I've played piano for many years and it's easiest for my ears to identify. Next purchase no questions asked is a Yggdrasil-!!!! All in all I am very happy with both companies but emotiva should truely  cull the xda and replace it with a refrence quality dac to match their premium components."

I don't stand on the audiophool side, but a more nuanced approach to all this is prudent.  One thing is for sure; one form of this bias is cheaper than the other."
audiophile,3dl64u,Brun420,2,Fri Jul 17 14:57:48 2015 UTC,"That's because there is none.  All this hogwash about ""premium DACs"" is really annoying. Any DAC chip costs about $3-$7, if that. Everybody is using those cheap chips (yes, even the ""ultra premium manufacturers"" such as Weiss and Moon), because it is trivial to build a completely accurate DAC. There's no point in developing a new chip.   When compared in blind tests, no one can tell them apart. (Unless of course there's some kind of filter built into the DAC, but that's just plain stupid engineering and really besides the point)"

The higher-end DAC chips from very reputable (only based on science) companies cost much more than $3-$7. Higher-end gear is not using cheap chips, and building a filter into the DAC is not a stupid idea.  It can be very easy to hear differences between audio DACs that are designed differently."

Essentially, you're paying $1980 for the nice exterior, some knobs and the name.   Also, I bet you can't tell apart a $30 DAC and the MOON 300d.2 or the XDA.2 or the Weiss DAC202 in a blind test.

You are not paying $1980 for a nice exterior, knobs, and name.  And yes, I can easily tell DACs apart in a blind test.

audiophile,3dmks3,WinterCharm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"The 4100 can do 2.1, however, the reason I'm asking is I want to know your reasoning for moving to 5.1  Most people here (myself included) will say get a 2.1 or 2.2 system with fewer speakers that are higher quality, as opposed to 5 crappier speakers for the same amount of money, because a good 2.1 system will recreate 3D imaging (what we call a wide and deep soundstage) just fine.  If you're reallllyyyy into movies and are truly setting this system up for movies and not music, that's the ONLY time I'd advise going with a 5.1 setup. In that case I'd look at selling your 4100, and grabbing a modern AV receiver, and going from there.  Also, that 4100 sells on eBay for about $800-1000, depending on the condition. It was produced from '78 to '85, and retailed for a whopping $2k back in the day. So... Don't think just because it's old, it's junk. :)  At 100 Watts per channel, it'll drive modern speakers with ease.   So, get back to me about why you're going 5.1 vs 2.1 or 2.2, and I can give you better advice :)   Ps: keep in mind that unless you have a ton of SACD's or Blu Ray Discs of surround sound recordings a 5.1 system is practically the same as a 2.1 for music - you'll just run it as an extended stereo, where the front left and back left speakers act like the entire Left channel on a 2.1 system. Because of this, most people go 2.1 and get a really nice speaker for the L/R. Costs the same as 5.1, sounds amazing for music and movies."
audiophile,3dmks3,WinterCharm,2,Fri Jul 17 21:44:45 2015 UTC,I mean that's very simple logic for me to stick to a 2.1
audiophile,3dmks3,WinterCharm,2,Fri Jul 17 22:30:22 2015 UTC,"You can still upgrade your current system. To me it looks like your speakers could be upgraded - that's likely where you'll get the most benefit.  After the speakers I'd look at upgrading your DAC to something made by Schiit. :) maybe the Schiit Gungnir which has digital optical and USB inputs, but still has the typical analog outputs that will play nice with your 4100, but allow you to connect more ""modern"" sources.   However, I'd suggest upgrading your speakers first, and then your DAC.   I hope this helps!"
audiophile,3dmks3,WinterCharm,2,Fri Jul 17 22:43:57 2015 UTC,The 4100 does sound amazing. It's just kinda bulky. Maybe I'm being nit picky and just looking for a reason so spend time and money on new gear...the stuggle is real.
audiophile,3dmks3,VOldis,2,Fri Jul 17 22:31:47 2015 UTC,":) there's nothing wrong with wanting to upgrade.   The trick is finding the right ""things"" to upgrade.   Right now your speakers cost $400, and the value of your amp is closer to $2k retail.   If you've decided to stick to 2.1, then I would simply look at upgrading your speakers :)  Check out the KEF LS50's - don't let their appearance fool you - they are incredible speakers and will sound a lot better than your klipsch setup right now.  Just grab a pair of KEF LS50's - it'll cost you around $1100, and sell your Klipsch stuff :) don't forget to grab stands for the LS50's, btw :)  With that 4100, it'll sound bloody amazing - the klipsch speakers you have probably don't to it justice."

Is it worth it to sell my klipsh anyway? I went to ~bigger is better~ and bought floor standings because i figured thats what went with big boy receivers. You think there is a nice set of L/R I can buy if i threw in a little more, maybe totaling around 600-700$? surely a 2.0 like that would sound better then what I'm working with.

audiophile,3dkoy8,minler08,3,Fri Jul 17 09:45:10 2015 UTC,"I think the contention is the signal is still in tact but the cable carries EMI into the electrical system of the computer and pollutes the ground of the cable feeding the D->A with that same noise. The secondary noise that travelled across the motherboard into the ground of the USB cable then pollutes the power in the D->A box. I don't buy that happening for a minute, but if I did I'd just use fiber networking to solve the problem instead of a $10,000 bandaid.  The real joke is unless the NAS is IN the room making fan noise the server is going to be in a closet somewhere and the $10,000 cable will be fed by whatever cable the construction guys pulled into the wall and getting interference from whatever noise the cheap power supply for the switch introduces at that location."

At CES Chicago that year (the first year that high-end manufacturers had their own official hotel), we made many double-blind tests with listeners from the industry and convention attendees. There were definite differences in the sound of various program material, and most agreed that the cables did improve the listening experience. And so it all began...

I've seen comments from reviewers how just the act of being forced to choose makes the test fail, they are under stress and cannot be trusted to use their talents to pick out what amp sounds better, or what cable shows such obvious improvements."

All open and exposed to elements. Used 3 seasons a year (-10 C to 35 C).   I would like a sound system:   Speakers attached permanently in rafters of gazebo (lots of options here). Separate receiver/amplifier (this way it can be kept hidden). Ability to pick up radio (AM/FM). Ability to plug in phone/mp3 player (audio jack is fine). Bluetooth would be a plus.   Am I looking for something that doesn't exist?

Is this a step up, or am I going to be spending a ton for the brand name?  Along with that, I need a pre-amp with a phono line. Provided I get the Orbit, should I get their pre-amp also, or am I fine with just grabbing something like Pyle-Pro PP444?  Thanks!"
audiophile,3dmbtf,dr_torque,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:12 2015 UTC,"Is this a step up, or am I going to be spending a ton for the brand name?   The Pyle is rubbish. The Orbit is a real turntable with a with a proper plinth, platter, tonearm and cartridge - and your records, or what's left of them if you've been using the Pyle for long, will be very very grateful for it.   Provided I get the Orbit, should I get their pre-amp also, or am I fine with just grabbing something like Pyle-Pro PP444?   After a point, there's very little audible differences between phono stages. The Pyle, I'm reasonably sure, falls below that point - the phono stage I usually recommend is this. That said, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with Orbit's offering, if it's more convenient to just order from 'em, you can go ahead with it."

You're limited in your choices of cartriadge, but the one it ships with is actually pretty damn good; the arm has an adjustable tracking force; and the rotation speed is pretty consistent. It's about the best you could possibly hope to do for 70$, and it's not killing your records, it just isn't doing them justice."

audiophile,3dmbtf,imchristianlowe,2,Fri Jul 17 15:59:06 2015 UTC,"So I'm looking to buy my first home audio setup. I have no clue where to even start to be honest. I really listen to all types of music but primarily I listen to dubstep, house, livetronica, classic rock and Grateful Dead. My comfortable budget is around $500-$700 but I can go as high as $1000. I'll primarily be using the system for music. Sometimes games and movies. The room which I will put it in is 16 feet x 18 feet. I'll mainly play music through my computer, laptop or phone but eventually I would like you're start a vinyl collection. I'm willing to buy used but prefer new. Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks."
audiophile,3dmbtf,Elaborate_vm_hoax,2,Fri Jul 17 14:51:10 2015 UTC,"Let's start with the easy stuff, are you looking for a 5.1 type system or more like a 2.0 system?  My normal suggestion is something like the Yamaha R-S500 then whatever speakers best fit your room and budget. This receiver is audio-only (no HDMI throughput) though it does have a phono pre-amp built in which is increasingly rare on newer gear.  Speakers... well that depends a lot on what you can get away with aesthetically. I like 2-way towers, but I also tend to lean DIY when possible."
audiophile,3dmbtf,imchristianlowe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"Probably a 2.0 system to start. If there is a way to start with a great 2.0 system and make it to where I could expand it into a 5.1 in the future, that would be ideal.  How dificult would it be to DIY? And would it be better than doing 2-way towers?"
audiophile,3dmbtf,Elaborate_vm_hoax,2,Fri Jul 17 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"DIY isn't too horrible depending on what sort of tools you have, and you get a lot better sound for the money in my opinion.  You can even get flat packs where the wood is all ready to go, you just have to glue it together and finish it up then assemble your parts. The drivers install easily, the crossover takes a bit of soldering in most cases, but nothing spectacular.  I built 2-way towers for around $300 total using this design and I've been blown away by them. They easily compete with what I've heard from $2k boutique towers. The value is there if you have the tools and skills to pull it off.  If you're really interested check out /r/diyaudio , there are some great suggestions over there for getting awesome speakers on the cheap."
audiophile,3dmbtf,imchristianlowe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I'll check it out. If I were to not go the DIY option, what speakers would you recommend?"
audiophile,3dmbtf,turbosubaru,2,Fri Jul 17 15:48:04 2015 UTC,Sounds like an audio video reciever with a phono input is your best option. That will be at least 1/3 your budget-maybe half.
audiophile,3dmbtf,imchristianlowe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"So would you recommend the Yamaha R-S500 or a different one? Also if the receiver is 1/3-1/2 the budget, which speakers would you recommend?"

audiophile,3dmbtf,imchristianlowe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:39 2015 UTC,Ok. I think I'll just stick with the 2.0 for now because from what I have read it's better for music and that's what I do 95% of the time. If I want a 5.1 I would just save up for a different setup. Can you recommend any decent 2-way/3-way speakers that won't break the bank?
audiophile,3dmbtf,turbosubaru,2,Fri Jul 17 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"Sure, towers or bookshelves"
audiophile,3dmbtf,Elaborate_vm_hoax,2,Fri Jul 17 22:23:41 2015 UTC,"I'm no good at commercial speaker recommendations, so I'd see what everyone else has to suggest.  I would go with a 2.0 system with some 2 or 3-way towers if you have the space for something that large. Go with something that doesn't require a sub if you can pull it off, that way you don't need to come up with the money for a sub as well. My commercial suggestions range up around $2-3k, so maybe someone else has some better ideas."
audiophile,3dmbtf,imchristianlowe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:13 2015 UTC,Yeah. $2k-$3k is a bit out of my price point. If I have to go slightly over $1000 I could but an extra $1000 is pushing it a little too much. I'm open to suggestions because I might be able to find it used or find a good deal.

It's has a 100 watt amp section (same as 2400) but it is designed to be able to output much higher wattage in small bursts when needed. It has way more power than I need for my fairly efficient Monitor Audio bookshelf speakers. NAD amps are known to sound a little warm, but mine sounds very clean and enjoyable. They are about 24 year old amps, so it may need a little work to run properly. My 3400 did not always turn on when I got it (bought it cheap off a guy who had it I'm storage for 4 years.)

His discussion on EQing resonances out of speakers made me feel like I have been on the right track with the DSP corrections I provide. Also helpful was the correlation between room measurements and anechoic.

Big companies have products that scale up the line. If you are an audiophile and watch this forum or read industry news, blogs, reviews, etc. then you can figure out who the player are pretty quickly.   To me, there will always be a future growth in speakers, headphones, microphones, and amplifiers. Digital encoding and playback  at this moment ,but that all could change. Look what happened to all the analog tape and vinyl playback engineers. My point being that audio will always need to be reproduced, so the hardware like speakers, headphones, and amplifiers will never change - we need those things. There may be improvements, but you need those basic things to reproduce audio.   Speakers and microphones will take more knowledge of physics. Amplifiers will take more EE knowledge. Tubes are not an area of growth, but it is good to have a working knowledge, but there are not many new tube designs happening. Even guitar amp guys keep making the same amps from years past. Although, with tube knowledge, it is a specific niche.  Without and EE, you are not going to get far. Maybe in sales or customer service, but for design, most require EE."

I have to pull headphones out slightly and jiggle it to some particular angle to get sound into my headphones.  At first I considered getting a small USB stick sound card just for working jacks but then I might as well consider something with a headphone amp to power my Senn HD595's.  Anyone been in a similar situation?  I'd like something that can get the most of the 595's.  Bells and whistles that would be good to have:   be able to toggle between headphone and laptop speakers without pulling out headphones.  This may get messy as it would switch sound cards. Was checking out the Xonar U3's.  It has separate jacks for mic and phones but sometimes I make calls using an earphone set with integrated mic and phone jack.  Support for the integrated jack would be great.   Budget is pretty open, would look at bang for the buck more.

The priority will be placed much higher on music (specifically from a turntable), but I will be using this as my home theater set up as wel  I've already done some preliminary research but I'm finding a hard time figuring out at what level will I need each component. No reason to get a $2,000 amp if my speakers can't handle it  My budget will look to be anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000. From what I'm seeing it'll be a turntable, L/R speakers, amp (with phono pre-amp ideally), and then later on add a subwoofer (maybe even 2, for parties and such)  Music wise I listen to literally every genre, including dabbling of Opera and such. The space is an estimated 15' and 40' or so long, since the living room and dining room have no physical wall to separate the space.  Questions:   Are those the pieces I need to build my system? Will I need a separate pre-amp for the quality I'm looking for? Anything else that will come with a turntable? I've never owned one before I can look at 'best amps' or 'best speakers of 20xx' lists all day, but I have no idea how to balance the 'power level' so that there isn't one large bottleneck in my system. Any resources to help with that or will it just come with extensive research? Any recommendations off the cuff that you would recommend me looking into?   Thanks!"
audiophile,3di0dx,ilkless,2,Fri Jul 17 03:03:19 2015 UTC,"The Marantz TT-15S1 is a fantastic turntable for $1499 that comes with a cartridge which retails for nearly $1000 by itself.  The Schiit Mani is a phono preamp for $129. The British measured its technical performance and it tested to be nearly beyond reproach at any price.  For a preamp, as /u/dr_torque said, get a preamp with processor bypass. His suggestions are sound. For power amps, the ATI AT1802 will likely serve you well at any volume level imaginable. They cost $1199.  That leaves massive budget for the highest-end speakers. Speakers that I've heard and loved at the price range include the $6000/pair retail Canton Vento 890.2. German-built behemoths with wonderful sound. At that budget though, there are custom build houses like Selah Audio and Salk Sound that'd build bespoke speakers with top-class components at prices much lower than retail speakers of equivalent parts quality as you buy direct from the manufacturer, cutting out the middleman and the retail premium. You'd also get carte blanche over the aesthetics of your speakers. I've never heard them as I live in Asia, but they are designed by people with MASSIVE technical chops whom I'd trust speaker design to. If you are American, please consider the Selah Audio Ottavo and Salk Sound Soundscape 8. There are Redditors that have gone down the direct-sales path so they'd be more able to advise you, but they offer tremendous value-for-money."
audiophile,3di0dx,dr_torque,2,Fri Jul 17 09:32:00 2015 UTC,"Hello. With that budget, there are obviously many ways to go - and you should really go into hi-fi stores and listen for a sound signature that pleases you, before you spend that kind of money on a setup. That said, shopping for Hi-Fi is exciting and I couldn't resist having a look to see what that money gets you. Even at that budget, used, in my view, is the way to go as the majority of the depreciation has already been incurred by the first owners - The turntable is the exception: where possible, I'd always look for a new one.  For a turntable I'd recommend this.   For speakers, you look to have a large listening area, so I'd recommend these. These would be my second choice. This is a good buy too, if you're okay with the aesthetic.   At this budget, I'd really look for a pre-power combination. I'd recommend this for a power amplifier, and this for a pre-amplifier. You'll need a phono stage too. That'll put you marginally (~5%) over budget, but if you negotiate hard you can shave a few hundreds off.   Edit: I see that you want to have compatibility to use with a home theatre. In this case, you can use this pre-amp or this one - both of them offer processor bypass, which means you can just hook up your receiver's pre-amp outs to this setup."

This is also a great buy, but will need a stylus/cartridge. All of these will be head and shoulders above the u-turn orbit. With the Dual, make sure you check the condition of the idler wheel before you buy it. The rubber surface should be soft and pliant.   Edit: All of these are built better than the u-turn orbit. They're all automatics and whilst usually a clean and lube fixes any problems, sometimes they may be a hassle to troubleshoot. The u-turn orbit is very simple that way, there's literally nothing apart from a motor pulley driving the platter via a belt."

My budget is around $110. I know the iphone 6 doesn't support aptX, so thats a huge bummer, but which of the two have better audio quality? Also, will the looseness of the Shadow wireless get in the way (aka will it fall off my neck easily when only using one bud)? I know the Inifinim has better battery life (14 hours of music playback compared to the SW's 8). And finally, which one has the better mic? I don't only plan on using it at work, so it'd be nice for a good quality mic. For reference, I own a pair of Shure SE-215s and love it. It blows everything else i've ever used out of the water.

audiophile,3di0dx,mildr3d,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"Budget: Under $1000AUD all up.  What I'm looking for: Mono bookshelf powerful enough to fill a medium sized bedroom (placement is confined to the top of a chest of drawers in the corner of the room so a stereo system isn't going to do much), non-ported subwoofer to pick up the low end and an amp to drive them, preferably with a tunable crossover and room to expand to a 2.1 system so I can buy another bookshelf when I move.  How I will typically be using the gear: Off axis performance is important, as is throw distance. I basically want to fill the room with sound.  Gear that I own: Behringer MS16: Kinda dry and dull sounding, lacks detail and treble extension, lows are muddy. Serviceable but not enjoyable. Brainwavz HM5: My daily driver, heavily modified and slightly EQ'd, they sound detailed and smooth to my ears with tight bass and silky treble, good extension on both ends. SoundMAGIC PL50: Absolutely gobsmacking mids, bass is tight and reaches deep but can feel a little lean, highs are detailed but are lacking some energy to my ears. Hippo Pro One: Nice and bassy but highs are somewhat splashy and harsh. Need to EQ down the 2-4kHz area to smooth off the edges a little.  Source: PC with outboard DAC. I use Equalizer APO to EQ to my tastes (I don't use room correction, however), so I'm happy to get a flat sounding speaker and then use that to give it some warmth and sparkle.  Material: Classic Rock, Indie Rock, Grunge, Neo-Psychedelic Rock, Hip Hop, Trip Hop, Reggae, Dub, Jungle, Neo-Soul, Electronica, House, Synthpop...  Willing to buy used: Yes, if it's in Western Australia.  Currently considering a Chane A2RX-C and a Crown DriveCore XLS1500. Haven't the faintest idea for a sub to pair it with though."

audiophile,3di0dx,mildr3d,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:26:07 2015 UTC,"I would like the ability to upgrade to a stereo set in the future, that's why I was looking at the Chanes, since I can buy them singularly, but with my current room/furniture situation I can't put two speakers far enough apart for them to create any sort of worthwhile stereo image from my typical listening position. They have to sit on top of a chest of drawers about 1.5m wide which is sitting in the corner of the room, and I would be listening from the centre of the room."
audiophile,3di0dx,complex_reduction,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:07:44 2015 UTC,1.5m should be wide enough for a stereo image? How far from the speakers are you going to be sitting?

audiophile,3di0dx,mildr3d,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:38:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I keep saying that this is only a temporary thing. I don't have room at the moment for floor standing speakers. All I want to know is if the speakers I've picked are a good choice, if there are any alternatives I should consider, what sort of amp I should use to power them that will have the capacity to push a 2.1 setup in the future, and what sub woofers I should be looking at (I prefer the tighter sound of non-ported models over the sheer quantity of ported subs, but I don't want to settle for a sub that's too weak to fill a bedroom sized cavity with bass)."
audiophile,3di0dx,complex_reduction,2,Fri Jul 17 14:07:36 2015 UTC,"Chane make excellent speakers for the price. Note that to use the A2rx-c in a 2.1 setup in the future you'll need to unscrew the tweeter and turn it 90 degrees so you can stand the speakers vertically.   The Crown amp is LUDICROUSLY overpowered for what you're trying to achieve here. It's rated to 300W @ 8 ohms, the Chane's have a maximum input power of 200W. They would explode and probably cause permanent hearing damage at the same time in a small room like yours.  Sitting 10 feet from these speakers you'd only need 60W to hit 100dB which is MUCH louder than you would ever realistically be listening to music (if you give a shit about your long-term hearing).   The SMSL SA-160 amplifier is good for 65W of clean power into 8 ohms, which should be more than enough for any realistic scenario. It's also very cheap and very small, so that's a bonus.   Alternatively, if you want a long term solution (especially for a subwoofer passthrough etc) you could look into buying a hifi integrated amplifier or receiver from Yamaha, Onkyo, etc instead. They're going to cost more like $500+ though rather than $100 for the SMSL.  The vast majority of subwoofers these days are internally powered so you don't need to worry about amplifying them."

audiophile,3dezfn,oscillating000,20,Thu Jul 16 03:22:46 2015 UTC,Yikes.  Even a 64k stream sounds better than AM.  A 128k stream sounds (a lot) better than 8 track and (to me at least) is about comparable to a prerecorded cassette or a typical FM station.  It's perfectly fine for background/non-critical listening.
audiophile,3dezfn,zed857,29,Thu Jul 16 00:00:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say a 128k stream blows cassettes out of the water and is a significant improvement over FM radio.  Saying something like Spotify, which streams 320k oggs, sounds worse than any of those examples is completely insane."
audiophile,3dezfn,CarltonCracker,2,Thu Jul 16 00:11:48 2015 UTC,Compact cassettes are terrible. Wow/flutter/hiss and nothing going on above ~15k unless they were recorded with very specific equipment.
audiophile,3dezfn,oscillating000,4,Thu Jul 16 03:23:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have some older cassettes from the late 70's / early 80's and I agree that a 128k stream sounds a lot better than those.  Some of the later ones where they switched to chrome tape sound pretty good and would give a 128k stream a run for it's money.  Mostly it comes down to picking your poison - more hiss on the tapes versus more compression artifacts on the stream.    Cassettes I recorded myself from LP or CD on Maxell XLII/TDK SA with Dolby B will generally sound better than a stream.  FM is all over the place.  A stream with little or no EQ applied to it by the provider will sound (a lot) better than an FM signal that is EQ'd/compressed to within an inch of its life.  On the other hand, there's a public radio FM station in my area where I'd say their 128k stream and their FM signal sound virtually identical.  The stream wins on the days where the FM signal is coming in weak (I'm at the very edge of their listening area).  As to 320k - yeah - that's going to win all the time."

I didn't grow up on vinyl but listen to it whenever I get the chance as I prefer it but don't mind digital at all. I heard most of my favorite music on MP3 first. Old dog/new tricks doesn't always work out and Neil is gonna call it how he sees it even if it seems crazy and he has always been like this. He quit Buffalo Springfield just before a big tv appearance. Just let him stay true to his muse. He made some amazing music. Check out Live at the Cellar Door for Neil Young solo bliss.

I listen to mostly classical which hasn't engaged in loudness wars, and there are numerous recordings available for popular pieces.   If I care about audio heavily I gain more by having click access to 10 recordings.

Sometimes I want the remastered, sometimes I want the old version."
audiophile,3dezfn,DrXaos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:15:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with the inadequacies of the search & metadata.  It really bites with classical too.  Expecting sophisticated research-library-like organized data for $5-$10 a month is unrealistic.  The data just aren't there.   Designing a truly sophisticated metadata format that encompasses nearly all possible variations, and search, and most importantly data entry and data cleaning is very expensive.  These services are a few people and they get their metadata from labels and ingest whatever they were given.  And still they're losing money.    Only if perhaps a tax-funded global library were to spend the (thankless) effort tagging every recording with correct metadata and share it for free would it improve.   My judgement is whether I'm better off after the $5-$10 than before, and answer is yes.  I might not always get what I'm looking for, but I like getting things that I didn't know were there."

audiophile,3dep6k,AiryDiscus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:30 2015 UTC,"$150-$200 is too low a price for a quality amplifier with that much output.   That is absolutely correct, you don't have to tell me that. I'd take my cheap and cheerful 100wpc audiolab any day over two A500's or 16 of your pro amps, without a second thought. Because watts an amplifier do not make.  All that crap aside though - Zeos is doing his own crazy thing with the A500's. He likes them, and now he's got more of what he likes. I'm happy for him."
audiophile,3dep6k,sky04,4,Wed Jul 15 23:27:17 2015 UTC,"That's a great little amplifier.  And the MDac in the background, also very nice.    I have an Emotiva DC-1 myself, which I will later pair with an XPA-200 in my home theater.  Mixed feelings about emotiva right now, but it would be a huge hassle to get audiolab gear in the US.  I wouldn't want 3602s in a home theater application.  They're fantastic amps, it's just far too much power to use in a home and the amps themselves aren't too pretty =)    Now, when we're powering two SRX700 towers for each the left and right channel as well as four SRX700 series subs for each channel to entertain a crowd of 2000, you bet I want a fleet of ultra powerful amplifiers to drive that load to 110dB."
audiophile,3dep6k,AiryDiscus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:38:49 2015 UTC,Quality amplification is hardly expensive or complicated to manufacture.    Doubt most people here would be able to tell the difference in a blind test.
audiophile,3dep6k,hitthisbowl,2,Fri Jul 17 05:19:29 2015 UTC,"It's not about the sound quality in this case  It's that the circuit doesn't have some very important and almost standard safety features for Amps in this wattage range, and the consequences of a failure in such an amp without safe decoupling circuitry is permanent damage to your speakers.  Tl;Dr: they don't have the safe disconnect circuitry and can ruin your speakers if they fail. BIG problem."

audiophile,3de6xb,ilkless,4,Wed Jul 15 16:01:05 2015 UTC,"Not that it is the best value in power amps, but I guess Swiss labour does not come cheap. This is built in Goldmund's Geneva factory alongside their megabuck offerings except this is sold direct without fancy casing. $1700 is also not the lowest price they can get it to, as they insist on using DHL. Insanely fast shipping. Local audiophiles got their amps within 48 hours of ordering, shipped from Geneva to Singapore, in South-east Asia. They also absorb all taxes and duties, including those incurred at the customer's side.  I think this is a commentary on audio jewelery and how much money actually goes into aesthetics. In some ways, this is the reverse of what Lexicon did by charging triple for an Oppo packed into a fancy case."

audiophile,3de6xb,Dre_wj,2,Wed Jul 15 17:58:24 2015 UTC,It's a very good amp if you need the power. I recently bought a pair of the Job monos but at 250W each they're basically idling hooked up to my relatively hi efficiency speakers. They need a heavier load to open up. I needed them for a specific project but will likely sell them when the project is done. Have several customers who love the Job 225 stereo amp. I believe Job is actually a U.S. company out of LA. One thing about the Jobs is they are DC coupled so any appreciable DC offset on the input signals will produce noticeable hum.
audiophile,3de6xb,BlueBrat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:49:00 2015 UTC,"I owned a Job 225 for a year. Great amp, but too powerful for my room. I downsized to a smaller integrated and am happy as punch!"
audiophile,3de6xb,BlueBrat,3,Wed Jul 15 21:30:15 2015 UTC,I can see why; it has very high gain. A passive preamp or low gain active preamp like the matching Pre2 would fit better.
audiophile,3de6xb,BlueBrat,2,Wed Jul 15 22:23:07 2015 UTC,"Why would that be?  Note: I don't have powerful amps, the citation if the strongest I own right now that works."
audiophile,3de6xb,DrXaos,2,Thu Jul 16 00:45:01 2015 UTC,"Any noise/hiss in the system would be amplified more than a power amp of typical gain (IIRC this has about 6dB more gain than average). One would also have to turn the volume control on the preamp less to reach a given volume. This means that the range on the volume control used is much lower, all else being constant - which can cause one to remain in the region with significant channel imbalance or even audible noise of the potentiometer. It is fairly pointless to have lots of gain, only to be forced to resort to much more attenuation than usual. The preamp would also more easily cause the power amp to hit clipping due to the high gain of the power amp. Their own matching preamp avoids that by using slightly lower gain than usual for a line preamp and a fancy optical encoder with much lesser channel imbalance at low levels.  I can kind of vaguely see the value proposition behind this amp: a compact class AB power amp that has high power for its size, with the very expensive 'Swiss Made' tag. Not so much for the original Goldmund."

Magnepans are not for everyone. They are perfect for classical, jazz, acoustic, and blues. If you want to turn them up to 11 and listen to rock, rap, or electronic music, they tend to sound rigid and thin. To me, Maggies don't sound well with music that has distortion, which rock and electronic music have a lot of. For rock music, I prefer regular cone based speakers like the Paradigm S8 or B&W 800."

The MMGs I listened to were hooked up to an Audio Research tube amp and Quicksilver tube line stage, playing Dire Straights, Jennifer Warnes, and Yellow - so, good equipment and recordings. Acoustic instruments (drums, strings, acoustic guitar), and vocals sounded excellent. I feel that loud rock music wasn't thin, but more compressed, as though they couldn't really handle so much volume at once, and detail was lost. Sorry, I am not great at describing these things (you'd think after 2 decades, you'd have the lingo down).   I'd rather keep the speakers that I have now, but Magnepan represents a killer bang-for-buck value, especially if buying used. I'm keeping my eye out for a pair, just to play around with."
audiophile,3dcn98,gimmebackmyracecar,2,Wed Jul 15 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"I agree that ""compressed"" is a much better term to describe what the Maggies sound like when playing rock music.

I mostly use my current speaker system to listen to music and occasionally will run movie or video game audio through it.  I currently have a very old JBL spot, it's starting to fall apart a bit. For replacements I'm looking at the Logitech Z623, The Harman Kardon Soundsticks III, or the Swan GT1000. All fall in at about the same price point of ~$150.

He is moving into a dorm, and he is a classically trained musician who also loves deep house and bass music. do you suggest buying a sub separate rather then spending ~400 on an even nicer set of 2.0's? He won't be playing it necessarily loudly, so a moderate increase in quality over the ability to be loud is what I'm aiming for. then again I'm no expert."
audiophile,3ddkdw,complex_reduction,2,Thu Jul 16 11:23:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, right. If he's moving into a dorm, I would not recommend buying a subwoofer. It will just infuriate everybody else in the building and he won't be able to use it. Even a relatively small subwoofer will penetrate walls, floors, and ceiling with bass and keep everybody awake. Once he finishes college he can move out and start buying monster subs!   For $350 you could buy a pair of Emotiva Airmotiv 5s which are very well regarded active monitors (no need for a separate amplifier etc), or $450 for the Airmotiv 6s (larger woofer, much larger tweeter means better dispersion of treble). The 6s especially will play down to 40Hz which will cover almost all types of music (it will not reproduce the super deep super loud EDM ""thump"", you really need a dedicated subwoofer for that kind of thing, but certainly more than enough bass to be satisfying in a small dorm room).  Alternatively, have you considered headphones? $400 is enough to buy world-class end game headphones, if you think your brother would be into that. You don't really get the same experience with headphones as you do with speakers, but he wouldn't be annoying anybody else in the building and could listen all day and night if he wanted to."

Im sure they will be an upgrade from the klipsh 2.1's and I can save a little money. Maybe its worth it to buy a nice DAC for the comp to round out the 400.

audiophile,3ddkdw,ilkless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:37:12 2015 UTC,"The D3020 has a USB DAC. CD players are obsolete. One can pop the CD into the disc drive of the laptop/desktop and play it on Foobar. Failing which, he can take any generic universal player and connect it via coaxial/optical. Phono? Add Pro-ject TT and Schiit Mani.  I see no issue with recommending the Salks when the LS50 has 4.3inches of effective radiating area. The SEAS midwoofers used have extraordinarily low bass distortion for the size that each put the LS50s to shame. They are doubled here. The Hiquphon tweeter used has the best CSD I've seen from a dome tweeter by quite some distance. The crossover designer knows his shit. And anyway, the intrinsic advantages of a concentric driver only start to get huge in the extreme nearfield where driver summation of non-concentric drivers are compromised significantly.  If the LS50 are a legitimate $1500 option, I fail to see why these aren't. I could recommend the Philharmonic Audio BMRs too, but the BMR mid driver makes me skeptical and I'm not sure if it is too large for his room."

However, I have no clue what I'm talking about -- but it just seemed to me like this would be much more room filling.  I have a cheap-ish 2.1 setup with JBL 305s and a Dayton subwoofer, and it just seemed like for a budget 5 x bigger it would be more than just improved amp/dac/monitors and minus a subwoofer.

Third, It's absurdely expensive compared to every other service.  Why you might buy something - Some of their music truly is a new remaster, you'll find the ""approved"" ones on Computer Audiophile or via Google Search. Some might actually be much better than what is available elsewhere, but figuring out which is a crapshoot.

You need an analog-to-digital converter to record the analog electrical signals into a digital format like MP3/FLAC/WAV/whatever. Shitty Crosleys and the like have that built-in but they are just terrible pieces of crap that destroy records as they are played on them.

audiophile,3ddkdw,ilkless,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"What model are the Yamahas?  Sell the Yamaha, get something like a NAD C316BEE + Schiit Modi 2. Then sell the Paradigms to get something better, because they are fairly low down the pecking order of greatness and yet have pretty darn good resale value. Speakers overwhelmingly determine the performance of a system, and Paradigms are not as good as the shills in the magazines make it out to be. You'd get MUCH larger improvements replacing the Paradigms. That specific model is also so old that new driver technology has made it possible to get substantially better speakers. That leaves probably a 1000 bucks or perhaps even more to play with speakers - and that gets you a long way, especially if you buy speakers direct from the manufacturer as you cut out the markup of retail. In America, the best bang-for-buck direct-sales brands in this regard are Salk, Ascend and Selah Audio."
audiophile,3ddkdw,Aspenbears,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I didn't know the paradigms had good resale value, so I'll look into selling them. I was looking at some NAD stuff. Are they about the best you get for that price?"

audiophile,3ddbvj,NoDrunkenMonkeyDude,9,Wed Jul 15 11:20:23 2015 UTC,"The equipment looks pretty clean. The amp is 4 ohm stable, which is pretty cool. That means it wasn't made with the cheapest of design choices. It's not particularly powerful, though, as evidenced by the 120W rating on the back. You're probably rocking around 30W per channel. Still, for a moderate system with fairly efficient speakers, that's enough. Just don't expect house-party levels. A little disappointing to see a lack of a phono input, but I guess that's to be expected for gear produced in this era. Certainly not a deal breaker.  The Beovox were a pretty damn good speaker. Sort of the ""low end of the high end"", if you take my meaning. They had decent drivers, an interesting baffle layout, and a true multi-component 3-way crossover. Compromises were kept to a minimum. Real wood veneers. If it were me, I'd be most interested in refurbishing those, even if I already had better speakers. A light block sanding with a fine grit sandpaper and then a few coats of oil would have them looking sweet.    The crossover capacitors have probably drifted from spec, so they should be replaced. That's easy, though. If you know which end of a soldering iron is the hot part, the caps can be replaced for a few bucks. But I suppose the first step ought to be taking off the grills to make sure the foam surrounds on the woofers had not rotted away (I can't remember if they were foam or butyl rubber). If they have rotted, it becomes a more expensive proposition. Still not horrible, but likely to be more than the $15 you'd otherwise invest in new caps.   And those Infinitys don't suck. Certainly not as special as the B&O, and definitely made to compete at a price point. They were probably the ones purchased with the Kenwood gear.   All in all, it has all the hallmarks of a good beginner stereo system."

audiophile,3ddbvj,looksfamiliar,2,Wed Jul 15 13:10:05 2015 UTC,"It's basically a micro system, I think they used to be popular to use as office systems before MP3 players were a thing. Things like this come to mind.  I think that would be slightly different since it's multiple pieces, intended for a home to use that just doesn't have a lot of room for a full sized system especially since it has separate pieces for the tuner, integrated amp, CD player, and cassette.  Most Kenwood stuff won't be seen with high regard by audiophiles, but it will sound better than they'd ever give credit. I don't know anything about the Infinitys, probably just standard affair which will sound ok but much better out there TBH. The B&O's are kind of interesting, as a brand they are considered like ""Bose for rich people"" but that's unfair, as I think a lot of B&O stuff is actually well made and nice sounding and is far less gimmicky than Bose. Never heard them, but I have heard a small set of B&O speakers as a part of one of their desktop CD systems and if they're anything like those they'll sound surprisingly good.  It's one thing if you had to pay for all this what a good price would be, but for free? Hell yeah, that's a way better system than I started with several years ago!  I was trying to find a pic online but I cannot and I do not remember the model, but my dad has a really cool Kenwood set from the '80s, silver with a flip down face that reveals more controls behind it. There's definitely some cool stuff from them, and while they have no audiophile ""cred"" they sound pretty dang good."

The Japanese yen had a lot of problems in the early 80s, and Japanese electronics manufacturers had to make some tough decisions in order to survive. Since Kenwood didn't have the diversification of Sony, Yamaha, or Pioneer, they were hit particularly hard, and cost cutting occurred across the entire product line. Eventually, they went car-audio only, where the margins were better.   But from about '76 to '82...they were nice pieces to have."

A wedge to angle the speaker up a bit can help with that just as well:  With the speaker angled up, you still get good on-axis response sitting in front of the monitor, and you also get more-on-axis response when you're milling about the room doing whatever you're doing.  There is no rule that stipulates that speakers must always face horizontally, and in your case, I think you've got that part wrong.  Advice:  Try also to trim the styrofoam to point them straight at the middle of your head while seated in a comfortable listening position, while also keeping them as low as possible.

audiophile,3d9q22,Modna,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, humming is a sign of the tube going bad. Do you still have that problem? I bought some cheap ones off ebay.   You can make an account on head-fi.org and search the forums. I was constantly on there and they have really good advice. I'm not sure which type of tube you'll need.   I've only had one amp ever, but my DV amp is built like a tank."

audiophile,3dcbnf,UnderSeaGaming,5,Wed Jul 15 03:56:50 2015 UTC,"This is more of a /r/headphones question.  Let's say you buy a Schiit Modi 2 and Magni 2 pair ($99 each)... they will probably never go out of date in any meaningful way.  The only part that CAN go out of date is the digital side: support for USB 2 devices will exist for at least another 20 years, we aren't going to stop using PCM, we're not going past 24-bit for precision, and we aren't going to go past 192khz.  The Modi will sit on your desk for at least a decade.  As for the analog part? RCA has been the standard for discrete unbalanced unamped audio channels since its inception over 60 years ago, and we're still using classic hardware (amps, AB switches, splitters, mixers, etc) from the 60s, 70s, and 80s that have RCA jacks, and they work just as well today as they did then.  The Magni will sit on your desk until you start getting into headphones that are massively expensive and either are hard to drive or require a bit more finesse than the Magni can handle.  The only parts I've seen that do go out of date are surround sound system preprocessors, and that is a slow process: upgradeitis for that basically stopped when the Bluray generation of gear came out with lossless DD and DTS modes and everything supported 7.1 by default, and getting room correction wasn't limited to the upper echelons of summit-fi.  The analog side of surround sound systems haven't really changed: speakers are either self-amped or they use some standard way of wiring speakers into an amp, subs haven't changed (although quality subs have gotten much cheaper and much better over the past 5 years), and the only thing we did was increase the number of channels from 2.0 to 5.1 to 7.1 (and that in of itself was a slow progression over 15+ years).  And I don't see Atmos ever taking off at home, so that isn't a big worry. Maybe if a lot of Bluray 4k titles ship in the next 2 years that support it I'll change my tune, but for now, no."

HiFi gear is, provided you care for it (no excessive heat, indoor smoking, liquid spills) usable for a very, very long time.  It's not uncommon to find gear in service that has been in constant use for 20, 30 or 40 years.  To say something specific about USB DACs:  USB 2, which most DACs operating on is a slowly dying standard - in another 5-6 years, I doubt you'll even find computers with USB type A connectors.  When that happens, you'll have to find an adapter cable (these already exist)."

It could be one side of a very compact, two tube stereo integrated amplifier. many tube amps use two triodes as a first stage to drive a pentode, which drives the speakers though a transformer, this tube simplifies that down to one bottle.  You could, with two of these have a complete stereo integrated amp, the medium mu triode as a preamp then the high mu and pentode as the power amp, it would probably max out at 5W or so, but that is enough."

I had a couple of modern DACs on loan costing about the same as the Copland when it was new, and I still preferred the sound of this player from the late nineties! Kind of amazing considering the advances in digital technology. Just goes to show how important a proper output stage and power supplies are for the overall sound, even within the digital domain. The Dynaudios are very very good, but also extremely power hungry. 200 plus watts RMS into right ohms seems to be the minimum for them to really start singing. That sharply limits the range of useful amps, at least ones that are reasonably priced. The Thules have the necessary grunt, but being around twenty years old, the capacitors inside will be failing any day now."

audiophile,3d9p5i,lr99gt,3,Tue Jul 14 16:23:45 2015 UTC,"There are two likely sources of noise in your setup:   The primary cause is that the Audioquest Dragonfly's output is amplified and not line-level. You're feeding this amplified signal for further amplification in your active LSR305's, and this always causes an increased noise floor.  The secondary cause may be that your laptop is outputting noisy USB power, which is being used to drive the audioquest - but I don't see this being anything other than a theoretical cause.   A d/a converter that outputs a line-level signal is really just what you're looking for, something like this."

audiophile,3d9p5i,PriceZombie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.   Here is some info from Audioquest's page:   DragonFly is also capable of being employed as a traditional fixed-output source component (such as a CD, DVD or Blu-ray player), and can be connected to a standard input on a receiver or preamplifier. For this application, both the music player’s volume control and the main operating system volume control should be set to maximum. This “fixed output mode” allows your audio or AV system’s volume control to be in charge.  So according to the above I should always have my comp volume set at full and just adjust the back of the LSR305s?   I also ready about noise USB.. my laptop had USB 2.0 as well and it exhibited the same noise. Would the Fiio still be worth it considering the dragonfly is suppose to do line level?"

I have a budget of about $400 and I can't decide between:   Teac UD-301 Fiio X5 2nd Gen iFi iDSD nano and AT-MH50 HD650   It is noted that I work in an open office and I already use Vsonic GR07's as well as Ultrasone HFI-650's, depending on my mood. I've been using the Ultrasone's more because they have a bigger soundstage and they are obvious to others that I am listening to music, whereas when I wear the GR07's people come up and talk to me and I miss what they say since they can't see I am wearing headphones.  I am leaning towards the Teac UD-301 because I want a good DAC and something that can power some HD650's when I can afford some later. I usually use the GR07's when on the go, but I listen to music at work and at home for music production and editing/mixing. I only throw the Fiio X5 in there because my main portable device is an iPod Classic 6th Gen and the Cirrus chip is not doing it for me. And it can also pull double duty as a DAC. The iFi device seems like a good compromise, but I thought I might upgrade my current closed headphones while I am at it.

They OEM'd for Mark Levinson, B&K back when it was a respectable name, Theta Digital and Outlaw Audio.  US-made, custom-wound in-house transformers. Measures at the state of the art with just about the lowest SNR you'd find anywhere. Sophisticated protection circuits. 7-year warranty. Built like tanks. Their higher-power lines even have a modular design that would allow you to pop out any damaged/fried amplifier channel like you would a PCI-E card for repair. Saves on shipping massively.  Oh, and very affordable in the grand scheme of things. Slightly more than Emotivas though. See the guts of their entry-level amp (that sells for under $900 and 600 B-stock).  Another direct sales wonder is Odyssey Audio's Khartago. 20-years transferable warranty with a unique service to custom-adjust the bias and some other parameters of their circuit to your system.

Stuff of your pioneer's vintage has always been conservatively rated, and Klipsch speakers are very sensitive - I'm sure your pioneer will have no problems driving your speakers.   Edit: I see that you're looking at and haven't yet bought the Klipschs. They sound rather distinctive, it's best to have a listen before you buy 'em."
audiophile,3d8yw6,rickman1011,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:03:25 2015 UTC,"Desktop Rig  Recently moved my Monitor Audio S2s to my desktop out of my livingroom in favor of my current flair.  Right now I just pulled an old home theater receiver laying around to power them.  Source is the digital out from a MacbookPro.  I generally play lossless audio formats, many times >16/44.1.  I also have a Polk Audio subwoofer, one of their higher end models (I can't remember the model number, at work) to fill out the low end.    So far, it's the best sound in the house but obviously realize the DAC and amplification are the weak points.  DACs and low power integrated amps, however, are something I possess little knowledge about.    I'm open to all suggestions.  New gear, used gear, preferably in sub $200 and sub $500 categories.  I'm assuming that's where I'd get amplification to match the loudspeakers with the most bang for the buck."

audiophile,3d8yw6,rickman1011,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:27:37 2015 UTC,Sony STR-DE998.  Just something I had in storage from a while ago.
audiophile,3d8yw6,dr_torque,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"I know it may not be what you want to hear, but really, getting a standalone d/a converter when you already have a (pretty decent looks like!) receiver is a game of diminishing returns. The amp section is supposed to put out 110 wpc, and notwithstanding that that's likely overrated, monitor audio speakers are fairly efficient and your receiver should have no trouble driving them. If you're really keen, though, - I see your receiver has pre-amp outs, why not connect your Adcom to it and see if it makes a difference?"
audiophile,3d8yw6,rickman1011,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:08:13 2015 UTC,Want to hear?  I'd rather thank you for good news.  I have no stigma towards brand names nor appearance.  I've always thought of the receiver as a nice piece of kit for the money.  I've played around with the idea of getting a ~50wpc higher end power amplifier and running it from the pre-outs.  I just wanted to make sure the internal DAC was of sufficient quality.    The Monitor Audios just really surprised me with their fidelity and I want to make sure I'm making the most out of them.

UV-cured inks fixed this problem, but not before millions of discs were made the wrong way.  The solvents eat a bit of the lacquer.  And then the oxidation begins.  Aluminum loves oxygen.  There's no stopping it once it begins.  (Pro-tip:  If you must place a CD down someplace other than back inside of its case, do so with the label side up.  Polycarbonate can be polished, aluminum oxide from a label-side scratch is forever.)"

Although Smile was never technically finished (I don't really believe that even Smile Sessions is the proper version, but it's probably the closest it will ever be) the way it was produced was revolutionary and phenomenal. We don't need to talk about Pet Sounds. Brian couldn't do wrong."
audiophile,3d14dr,anleja,2,Mon Jul 13 00:25:55 2015 UTC,"Hah, well, I'm gonna go ahead and talk about Pet Sounds anyway. Asking you, a fan, do you prefer the mono or stereo mix?"
audiophile,3d14dr,goldmoogle,2,Mon Jul 13 04:08:08 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have mixed thoughts on the mixes. Brian was deaf in one ear so he personally heard everything in mono. I HAVE to imagine the mono mix is more akin to what Brian envisioned when he wrote everything. I also assume the reason the stereo mix has such hard panning for a lot of instruments is because of this deafness, he probably did one ear at a time instead of both at once. This makes it kind of goofy to listen to because you're getting some timbres from one side and different timbres from the other. The place the stereo mix really shines however is on tracks where Brian panned two separate vocal takes in each ear which adds a really amazing element to the sound and always impresses me. I think both mixes are really good and have their own merits, but I own the stereo mix on digital and vinyl so I would suspect I'm partial to it."
audiophile,3d14dr,anleja,2,Mon Jul 13 07:29:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thoughtful reply. I did notice that the stereo mix I listened to was almost in SUPER stereo, where it was like an adventure being hit with the sounds all around. It is not subtle at all.   I did not know about his deafness, I'm thankful he was spared hearing in at least one ear! Knowing that, it seems as if he may have made the stereo mix initially. I guess it is speculation, but knowing that he did have a hand in the stereo mix is cool. I assumed some studio employee was assigned the job, but knowing that Brian Wilson was involved with the stereo mix makes it seems that it is still his vision being experienced.   I guess now I just figure out which one I like best, thanks again for the time in writing your response."
audiophile,3d14dr,goldmoogle,2,Tue Jul 14 03:48:30 2015 UTC,There was an interview recently where they talk about his deafness and how he made such incredible stereo music despite it. I guess you just can't hinder some talent.
audiophile,3d14dr,Skwisgaars,3,Tue Jul 14 04:53:13 2015 UTC,"Not just talking clean and 'perfect'.   Pain of Salvation's Road Salt Two, the vocal production with ridiculous amounts of harmonic distortion and compression, the weird guitars, the sometimes over the top early reflections, the vast difference between the up front, clean sounds and the wet, luscious soundscapes in the background. Pretty ridiculously good album if you're in to bluesy prog.

I feel an album with production quality would have, quality audio, collectively coherent tracks and are an enjoyable experience start to end. For me, the following albums hold this standard...   Dire Straits - Dire Straits  Eric Clapton - 461 Ocean Blvd Beck - Sea Change Neil Young - Harvest Bob Marley & The Wailers - Exodus John Lee Hooker - It Serves You Right to Suffer Great Lake Swimmers - Lost Channels The Notting Hillbillies - Missing: Presumed Having a Good Time Cowboy Junkies - The Trinity Session  (DAT recording in a church)   Others have already been mentioned, but these I continually refer to."

Grounding to your amplifier or phono pre-amp is the preferred method.  Rewiring the table for a 3 prong plug and an earth ground might induce other forms of feedback or ground loops.    If there isn't a true permanent ground lug, often you can still ground to case via a screw or other conductive element on the casework.  What's your back panel look like, maybe we can find a likely candidate for a grounding point if you get a pic."

It's much more convenient since it's natively supported and the built-in music app just beats third party solutions. Then again, in my opinion space and number of albums on a mobile is more important than high end fidelity in those situations. So, I'd go with lossy copies for mobile use - ALAC would come in handy in that regard too: iTunes enables you to always transcode the music you sync to your device to lossy AAC on the fly - no need to maintain two formats of your library."

The iPhone itself, at the very least since the iPhone 5 has a 24-bit DAC.    iOS itself places no limit on which sample rates can be used - it's all dependent on the DAC - I frequently use 24/96 with an external DAC and various synths."

The DAC in the iPhone 6+ measured on par with a $2,000 professional reference DAC  http://www.kenrockwell.com/apple/iphone-6-plus.htm#comp   I tested a Beyerdynamic A200p DAC and headphone amp at the same time I had the iPhone 6 Plus in my audio lab, and the iPhone 6 Plus beat it! The iPhone 6 Plus has less distortion, flatter frequency response and much better ability to drive low-impedance headphones with low distortion than the dedicated portable amp!  While all iOS devices have always sounded great if you have good transfers, the audio output of the iPhone 6 Plus is now so improved that it sounds and measures about as well as professional reference DACs like the Benchmark DAC1 HDR, and better than many consumer DACs.  The iPhone 6 Plus even has flatter response than the Benchmark DAC1 HDR! Of course an iPhone and a plug-in-the-wall professional DAC are intended for entirely different pupposes, but if the 1 volt RMS output (6 dB less than good outboard DACs and CD players) and 3.5mm jack do it for you, there's no reason not to use the iPhone's output for critical listening."

audiophile,3d4ksq,ilkless,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"Solid parts. Not close to the state-of-the-art, but still bang-for-the-buck wonders in the driver world. The crossover seems to have some solid documentation and sound theory behind it. I'd say go for it but keep in mind you'll likely be unable to sell it on in the future if you upgrade."
audiophile,3d4ksq,Elaborate_vm_hoax,2,Mon Jul 13 22:25:10 2015 UTC,"Judging by the parts used and assuming that the person built the x-over properly and with decent parts $100 probably isn't a bad deal. The Dayton reference series is quite impressive, though I'm less familiar with the Sea's tweeters.  Honestly I'd give them a listen and see if they work for what you think you need. They'll probably be better than anything new at that price, but that really depends on the crossover more than anything and I have no idea what was done on that end.  The build quality seems moderate, but the seller noted the issues so they should be okay as beginner speakers."

audiophile,3d4ksq,awgoody,2,Mon Jul 13 19:36:51 2015 UTC,"I noticed you said ""$400-500 for now"". So what reasonably would you add in the future? I ask because if you are still saving, I'd suggest you hold back on surrounds and spend the $500 on a better receiver and left and right speakers (possibly a subwoofer, possibly a center) for now. You can then buy less expensive surrounds later.   There is no reason your fronts have to match or even be the same quality as the surrounds - just get the left, center and right the same. Your new receiver can make up for their differences.  For example, with the yamaha also posted at $300, you could get something like the JBL Arena 120 ($150  each), and later buy the $80 set of micca speakers mentioned in the OP for surrounds.  I'm sure others on here have better specific speaker recommendations, but I think you really should consider this general idea."

audiophile,3d4ksq,The_Bob_Evans,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"So, I just started purchasing some stuff to make a nice little stereo setup. I bought a set of RCA SPK400 speakers for $30. Yes, I know those are old home theater speakers, but I don't need much because I live in an apartment. I am also purchasing an immaculate Pioneer SX-434 for $100 this week.  My question is what else do I need? My ultimate goal is to be able to pump audio from a computer through a stereo. Do I need any sort of DAC or preamp for that?    I don't know what I'm doing, so please break your answers down Barney style for me please.    In the event that I do need to buy any of the above components, what should I look for on the used market for $50 - $100?"
audiophile,3d4ksq,Elaborate_vm_hoax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"To go through your computer to make sound that would get you started.  To connect your computer to your amplifier you'll need something like this.  To connect your speakers to your receiver you'll need speaker wire if you don't have any. 16 or 14ga would be a plenty for your needs. I get this off amazon as well, whatever I find that I feel like paying for.  In all honesty unless you plan on adding a TT you could go with something like a Lepai 2020A+ and save yourself $80 that you could put into better speakers. Unless the Pioneer receiver has been checked out and fixed up by a qualified tech you'd want to get that done in case the capacitors are out of spec, which they probably are at this point.  If you want to run a turntable, the Pioneer would be a good way to go and would prevent you from needing a pre-amp, if not I would probably go the hassle-free new gear way."

One thing he wants is about a 250-300 foot cable run so he can get speakers away from the house where they usually hang out. This isn't an area where they could have the equipment for a separate system. Just wants to be piped into main system.  Can 12-14 gauge wire push that far?  The receiver will be shielded from all outdoor elements minus the humidity and fluctuating temperatures. Same for most of the speakers. ""Slim to none"" budget as he says. Any ideas?

audiophile,3d4ksq,ssl-3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"Without realizing it, you're asking about commercial audio systems.  These are high(er) voltage, resulting in less drop along the path of the wire, resulting in cheaper (smaller) wire -and- the ability to properly drive many speakers in parallel from a single amplifier.  Assuming that stereo isn't important (and if you think about it, mono is probably just fine for the intended use):  Advice:  Find a used Toa 900-series mixer/amplifier.  This will have a 70-volt, transformer-coupled speaker output as well as preamp out / power amp in jacks, so it is flexible to be used in any configuration you can come up with.  It is also a generally fine-sounding amplifier that will probably outlive you and your uncle put together.  70-volt outdoor speakers.  Seriously, just Google ""70v outdoor speakers"" to get a feel for what is out there for slim-to-none budget.  The difference between a ""70-volt"" speaker and traditional 8-or-whatever-Ohm speaker is the presence of a transformer, which converts the relatively high-voltage on the wire to the relatively low voltage that all conventional loudspeakers expect.  You can also install transformers inside of existing, run-of-the-mill speakers.  For small power levels and non-audiophile quality, these are cheap.  (Or, for that matter you can install an output transformer at the output of any existing amplifier and, properly configured, make that work.  But that's more complicated than I'm willing to go into without at least learning if I'm barking at the right tree.)"

You might like the 4Ω tap more than the 2Ω if your speakers respond well to a higher voltage signal.  The 2Ω setting would (in theory) give you better bass (damping factor plays a bigger part at the lower frequencies) but 50 is such a small DF that it is most likely and undetectable difference. Even with just 5 feet of 14awg cable attached your DF will drop to around 35.

It's likely your AVR has a better DAC and analog section than what's found in your computer. Although perhaps not depending on which AVR you have.

From what I've read, the DragonFly is a good piece of kit, but I haven't tried it myself."

audiophile,3d3o7d,timstm,6,Mon Jul 13 07:06:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm not too well versed with AV, but I can spot a couple of things: Your ""receiver"" is actually an amplifier, which means if you feed it a surround signal, it'll amplify it and send it to the speakers. It has no decoder. Your projector is outputting stereo (2.0) through its 3.5mm jack and that's what your amplifier is feeding your speakers. If this is the case, it seems extraordinary that you're hearing anything from your surround speakers, unless your amplifier is adding some sort of virtual surround. Really, the best way out is to get a proper surround receiver - your amplifier really really is a bit rubbish. Something like this, will do nicely, although I recommend this only because it was the cheapest decent one I could find. You could always look on the used market though! The second way out is to get a surround decoder, something like this, but this won't help you with HDMI switching."
audiophile,3d3o7d,dr_torque,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:24:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the response, this has been crazy helpful for me to find a way to understand whats going on here, and even with some basic audio concepts. I always kinda knew my amp/receiver was trash, but unless it is the most viable option, Id rather not upgrade at the moment. The biggest realization Ive had (and this probably sounds obvious, but it's one of those things that no one ever told me) is that any single cable of audio INPUT into my receiver only has the capability to output to ONE speaker. Therefore, to have  surround to a total of 5 speakers and a subwoofer, I need 6 audio inputs. I think I was able to hear sound from my rear and center speakers before because it's a crappy product and picks up small levels of those signals, so it was there but extremely quiet. That's my only guess anyway. Also, the sub worked fine but I dont know why, since there was never any subwoofer input plugged in, just the sub out  On my receiver, there is a ""DVD input"" and an ""Audio Input"" section. If my current understanding is correct, before I was not seeing that inputting 2 RCA cables into the ""Audio Inputs"" isnt capable of 5.1 surround; I need to run 6 cables to the ""DVD inputs"", yes? Therefore, if I use a product like you listed, I can run an audio singal to it and output it into 6 channels which can be plugged into the DVD inputs as 5.1 surround? If this is correct, this is pretty much 95% of my problem, and now I can fix that!  To explain what I was trying do in my original post, I thought that if I got simply an HDMI a/v splitter that just splits HDMI video out and 2 RCA audio out, I would be able to bypass my projector's 2.1 stereo Audio Out jack by splitting the audio from the HDMI input and outputting from the splitter to the receiver (again with just one red and one white cable). This is of course no better than just outputting from the projectors audio out jack, which was never ideal or really even suggested in the first place.  Instead - while I think I still need a splitter like that - I also need a decoder. Specifically, I need a device that takes HDMI as an A+V input, and outputs 6 audio channels along with HDMI vid. That way, I can connect devices like my laptop, computer, or Steam Link to the decoder/splitter via 1 hdmi cable, then run the HDMI video out to the projector, and the 6 audios to my receiver.  I think this would solve the problem, but Im a tad worried its getting to the point where Ill have like 4 or 5 inferior products working together when if I had done alot more research before hand, I could have better quality for a similar price, which sucks, but fuck it."
audiophile,3d3o7d,dr_torque,2,Mon Jul 13 19:43:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the audio inputs look to be stereo - and the DVD input is where, as you rightly say, you'd plug in analogue cables for surround sound. And you're right, 6 connections for DVD input.    I need a device that takes HDMI as an A+V input, and outputs 6 audio channels along with HDMI vid   You could also get a decoder that accepts an optical/coax input, if your source has an optical/coax digital out. (most do)   but Im a tad worried its getting to the point where Ill have like 4 or 5 inferior products working together    You already seem to be working towards this.

Ill probably continue upgrading as time goes on, and when I get to a place where I can comfortably afford a nice receiver, maybe even some higher quality speakers, Ill definitely go for it. I lurk around and every once in a while buy some stuff over at /r/hardwareswap, im sure halfway decent receivers come up every once in a while - even though most of the stuff there is PC Desktop build related..

It's unlikely that a commercial mastering engineer would simply be hard clipping the mix, so the restoration algorithm would need to identify what sort of peak limiting was done.  At any rate, it would be much more complicated than just tracking down the master tapes and doing a remaster, and the algorithms are too complex to be done with a simple plugin or by an amateur."

audiophile,3d0lna,PongSentry,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:42:58 2015 UTC,"Mhm..   Found this on the software's website:   Most declippers to date restore spikes based on the last few samples just before clipped audio starts and the first few samples after the clipping ends. While this does restore some lost dynamics, it often does not remove the distortion that is caused by clipping.  Perfect DeClipper uses a revolutionary new algorithm to restore clipped areas in audio recordings. This new algorithm does not only restore the dynamics, but it also removes almost all the distortion.  A perfect reconstruction is not possible because some data is lost. Perfect DeClipper is called 'perfect' because I think I can mathematically prove that its algorithm approaches (one of) the best possible reconstruction(s) based on the data that is available.   And this video demonstrates more tracks than just those two. I'm not sure how notorious these ones are, however.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqOljvx9KaM"

Usually, simple math will just generate arbitrary signals in the most basic shape above the clipped off portion. The logic being, so long as the wavelength is ''reconnected'' then it is no longer disjointed or clipped and the wavelength as a whole will be less distorted.  The creator of Perfect Clipper, however, claims that his proprietary algorithm is more sophisticatedly complex and intuitive when it comes to detecting whether a song suffers from bad hyper compression or not, and a lot better at estimating what the original peaks would have been like than other programs that try to do similar things. In short: his doesn't just ''reconnect the gaps'' but intelligently analyzes the entirety of the wavelength to recreate the peak to as close to what it was in its original stage.  It's not perfect, and he even claims this himself. But it's not degrading the quality. If anything, it's getting a little closer to its genesis, no?"

You have to remember that the reason we had a loudness was in the first place is because louder sounds [psychoacoustically] better.  You have to reduce gain in order to apply this algorithm, which is also reducing signal-to-noise.  There's always going to be a tradeoff."

If you do have the better mastered version available, you can always start over with that. But if the CDs you own are poorly mastered, there's nothing that be done to fix them.  This is the whole issue with so many newer masterings and recent remasters. Nobody wins in the loudness war.   Edit: You could try to add in a little mid scooped EQ to make the songs tolerable to listen to. Loudness is often emphasized in midrange frequencies. But if the compression introduced waveform distortion (highly likely when mastered for loudness), EQ may will probably just make the distortion more apparent.  Do some googling on the loudness war."

Listening to music is really subjective, so give ReLife a shot and if you like it/enjoy the music more with it, who cares what anyone else thinks?

audiophile,3d0hy1,azedarac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:54:28 2015 UTC,Before purchasing the behringer uca222 I must alleviate a worry I have. Hopefully this can be answered here if it's not the right place feel free to direct me where appropriate. I would like to be able to send audio from the PC to the amplifier through TOSLINK or RCA cables and video from the PC to the TV through HDMI. My worry is would there be a delay between audio and video? There is no issue when purely listening to music from the PC to the amp. However if watching a video I worry therei might be an annoying delay. The reason I want to split is that I want to be able to control the PC with my phone for music whithout having to turn on the TV. At the moment the chain is PC to TV with HDMI and TV to amplifier through optical. There are HDMI audio extractors but they need to be powered on with a power supply. The behringer uca222 is powered through USB and gets the audio from the USB port. Thanks.
audiophile,3d0hy1,tom6561,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:39:29 2015 UTC,I would suspect that it would depend on the amplifier in question - my old Denon had a bit of lag but my new Cambridge Audio 651A is a lot better.

audiophile,3d0hy1,playitonnotdoppler,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:53:45 2015 UTC,Bought the Bose Soundlink mini recently and I'm kind of disappointed with it. Sounds beautiful for music but when I'm watching movies or netflix (probably 80% of usage) the bass is sometimes overwhelming (as well as a minor lag in voice-picture sync - not a problem with vlc but is with netflix). Any ideas for a speaker better suited to my needs? Preferably bluetooth/wireless connection to my laptop but I'd be willing to hook it up to a bluetooth transmitter.
audiophile,3d0hy1,zim2411,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:41:10 2015 UTC,Bluetooth is always going to have that lag. If your software can't compensate for it (like VLC can) you can't really do anything about it.

For example-at my country club, many members own a soundlink mini and attach it to their golf cart for background tunes. I've not heard of people purchasing that unit for laptop speakers.  You don't have to get what I linked-but it is a much more complete and fuller sounding unit & a what hifi award winner, which is why i suggested it for your particular use.  Perhaps you could see if a wired connection fixes the delay with Netflix.  Edit: you can demo the Cambridge units @ richer sounds if you have one nearby.

audiophile,3d0hy1,TactFully,2,Sun Jul 12 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"The MB42x (and the Dayton B652 Air, kinda) is the absolute cheapest decent (has a crossover and no major annoying problems) speaker out there as far as I know. It is the absolute entry level and even the most untrained/uninitiated listener would immediately be able to tell the big difference in quality vs some $30 logitech pc speakers or similar. It's more than worth it unless you're struggling to make ends meet.  I also have no doubt that if I gave you an A/B test with the Miccas vs some good $250 speakers you would also immediately notice the difference. What I'm saying is that the point of diminishing returns is definitely higher than that - if you care about audio quality even just a bit."

audiophile,3d0hy1,TactFully,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not that experienced in the audio world myself, I'll tell you a few things I've read though.  Audio gear can last decades if not abused.  Don't rush for popular stuff like the Audioengine stuff. The A2+ isn't really good for the price or too good at all. They are just barely reasonable for the extremely tiny size - I don't think they're even any better than the Miccas, actually worse.... For about $250 right now the JBL LSR 305 are some of the best out there. If you want powered that is. If you want the flexibility of passive speakers which you can connect to a separate amplifier (e.g. an A/V Receiver which gives you other flexibilities) then there are even more options there as well, depending on your budget. For that sort of budget, for passives the Wavecrest HVL-1 and Ascend CBM-170 are good.  NOTE that none of this matters much if your room sucks. If it's an acoustic nightmare with echoes then any speaker will sound worse than the Miccas would in a good room."

audiophile,3d0hy1,zim2411,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:17:47 2015 UTC,"Yup! Have you heard the LSiM series in person? I listened the 705's at a shop a few years ago and they left an incredible impression on me. I put a Radiohead song on and I've never heard a stronger phantom center effect ever -- Thom Yorke was definitively there in the room. Everything was presented beautifully and with gusto, and never offensive. I listened to B&W 802D's after that and they didn't get me nearly as excited -- good, but absolutely not worth 4x the cost of the Polks. (Though they were in a different room entirely which definitely played a role)   Currently the 705's (or 707's) are my dream speaker, but I'm not in a position to jump on them now, and I'd do a lot more research to be sure when I am ready to buy. Namely, I want to give GoldenEar in particular a solid listen."

There is one authorized dealer in town(a custom ht installer) who can order the 707s for me with a quote of $1880 each. Now I'm seeing $1300 each on the eBay store...so tempting. I've been infatuated with these for weeks. I just want 2 big ol 50 inch towers to do my music and blurays justice and more.  And I love working man brands like Polk, for example my car, an 08 Subaru legacy gt, was the working mans euro sport sedan alternative when in production. The 707 is the working mans end game hifi."

audiophile,3d0hy1,flavianpatrao,0,Sun Jul 12 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"I am moving to atlanta in a couple weeks for a new (real) job/career. I have a studio apartment and want to add a great sound to my Sony TV. In doing my homework I see that soundbars and HTIB are a no-no. So after a lot of videos and reading.... I think I want to do a 3.1 system I am looking to use the system for my movies (apple tv, cable - soccer, ps4, chromecast, netflix), gaming AND music (i listen to a LOT of dance music so porter robinson and eric prydz (vinyls maybe, will be using my airport express to get airplay. with dance music i get files that are 320 kbps and at times i get really crappy recordings) but also some RHCP   I have not settled on a receiver (probably a denon under 400-450 in a 5.1 option) For the sub I am leaning towards the BIC F12 No amp   For the front three L/C/R I was thinking of either :   The Wave Crest Audio HVL-1 (3 of them as LCR)  OR  The Chane  (Either Three A1rx-c  OR  Two A1rx-c & one A2rx-c in the future as my center)   I love that the HVL-1 does mids well but I am worried that dance music will not sound as good on it and am hoping the where it lacks the BIC F12 will make up for it with the bassy stuff/lows  On the other hand with Chane, prices are creeping up for the whole system (new job outta college) and I feel I will lose those rich mids. But I could buy just three of the Chanes (not sure about the config) but since they are bassy, I could get the sub later  I know I cant win em all. What do you guys think is the better option? I'd love to hear your opinions. Thanks folks!  TL; DR : Three Wavecrest HVL-1 with BIC F12 (OR) Chanes as LCR with or without BIC F12 for tv + dance music + ps4 gaming?"

audiophile,3d0hy1,flavianpatrao,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:46:50 2015 UTC,That receiver suggestion is spot on! Its weird how I never came across it. I kept hitting the 1504 and other models. Am going to read up on them a little but I love the suggestion. Thanks! Have come across the speakers you mentioned but have not looked into it in detail. I'll look at them as well.
audiophile,3d0hy1,zim2411,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:21:07 2015 UTC,"Do you need a slimline receiver? You can get the SR5009 for the same price, which packs way more power and features, including better Audyssey room correction."
audiophile,3d0hy1,flavianpatrao,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:07:52 2015 UTC,"No, a slimline is not a must. Given all features to be equal, a slimline would be preferred. Then again it depends on what the added features being offered are. I think I looked past the SR5009 because of the price, but A4L might be a way to overcome that hurdle...especially if they back it up with a 3 year warranty"
audiophile,3d0hy1,zim2411,2,Sun Jul 12 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"Neither the Chane nor the Wave Crest dig low enough to really provide satisfying bass for dance music IMO, you'll want a sub with either one. You'll also probably end up crossing over at 80 Hz with either speaker too. Keep in mind the Chanes are rear ported so you would want to pull them at least a foot away from the rear wall/surface for the best performance. The Wave Crests are front ported so you are fine backing them up against the back wall."
audiophile,3d0hy1,flavianpatrao,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"Took me a few youtube videos to understand crossovers :) You are right about them both needing subs for dance music. Based on reviews, Chanes work (compared to HVL-1) well with the lows so it is slightly better with movies and games and dance music.  I am leaning towards the Wavecrests and the BIC 12 combination. And seriously considering the MArantz NR1506 suggested by turbosubaru.  Thanks for taking the time with your suggestion!"
audiophile,3d0hy1,arctic9,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:47:56 2015 UTC,"I just recently got this set up minus the sub.   Marantz NR1403 and Wavecrest HVL-1. I was really impressed. I thought I'd need a sub but for the amount of space I have, I'm not sure if its necessary. They sound great for music and cinema as is."
audiophile,3d0hy1,zim2411,2,Sun Jul 12 15:52:30 2015 UTC,"My point was that under 80 hz the HVL-1 vs. the Chanes don't really matter if you're using a sub. You don't want them even trying to recreate that bass, you want them focusing on the regions they can reproduce well. Everything below 80 hz is redirected to the subwoofer. Given that, I would lean towards the HVL-1."
audiophile,3cykq0,franciscohumb,7,Sat Jul 11 23:16:47 2015 UTC,"Check your sample rate, soundcard settings, speakers. Try those files on other systems. It's probably your soundcard"
audiophile,3cykq0,jtn19120,2,Sun Jul 12 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"Normally rips do not go through the sound card at all. Although it is possible on some systems, most likely the CD-ROM drive is not even hooked up to the sound card.  Instead, the ripping software connects to the drive the same way it would to read data: through the bus (SATA, PATA, USB, etc.). From there, it sends commands (with ATAPI or whatever other command set is appropriate for the data bus) to the drive to put it into CDDA mode, and the drive sends (digital) chunks of audio data to the computer over the data bus."

audiophile,3cykq0,adrianmonk,2,Sun Jul 12 05:44:11 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to playback of the audio file. If it's a low quality soundcard or there's something wrong with it, there could be noise in the D/A conversion. If it were a problem with the file itself, it would show up both places."

The voltage doesn't come fully most of the time is 150V then the electric cut off and one of my dad machine was destroyed because of this. He said that he need of this machine.  My question is   1.Does this machine works on 220V or its need conversion ? Im from Thailand 220V is my country socket and plug voltage.   About the warranty and repair. Looks like he nees to import this machine. Alternative machine    Thank you very much.

audiophile,3cwuz2,mpelleg459,0,Sat Jul 11 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're thinking 2 towers and no sub?  I'd look hard at aperion's intimus towers, svs prime towers or golden ear triton 7s in that budget. Then add as nice an amp/stereo reciever as you wish/budget allows/has the features you want.   Another option, if you have the space to set them up properly, is a pair of magnepn mmg speakers, though you will need to get a powerful, high quality amp, which won't be a problem w your budget.   Out of curiosity, why do you rule out all bookshelf speakers?"
audiophile,3cwuz2,zbindenren,0,Sat Jul 11 23:01:57 2015 UTC,Thx for your reply.  Because I do not have any shelfs to place them. I assume towers are easier to setup.
audiophile,3cwuz2,mpelleg459,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:45:29 2015 UTC,"I'd echo that you may wind up happier with relatively large cabinet/large driver bookshelf speakers on stands than towers.  You do pay more for the extra cabinet materials in towers, though that extra cabinet volume may buy you greater efficiency and/or deeper bass.    /u/ilkless made good suggestions, though I've not heard the Phil BMR (very few have as they just started shipping), but Dennis Murphy/Philharmonic make very fine speakers.  It was designed to compete with (or best) the Ascend Sierra 2, which is in the same price range, but is more thoroughly reviewed by virtue of the fact that it has been on the market for a bit."
audiophile,3cwuz2,ilkless,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:20:48 2015 UTC,"You can get stands to put your speakers on. Most non-floorstanding speakers are meant to be positioned as such. 'Bookshelf' speakers don't literally necessitate placement on a shelf. Most would sound like crap with such placement, in fact. Since you still need an amp, your speaker budget is realistically 1k+. You won't do much better than the Philharmonic Audio Philharmonitor BMR for ~1.5k. Standmount speaker size, but as much bass as many floorstanding designs. Stands should be under a hundred from Amazon (Sanus is a good, cheap brand to start with - but look out for the maximun specified load; they have dinky stands and sturdier models)  Get a Marantz PM6005 for amplification. That would poke you slightly above your budget, but yield what is an endgame system for most."

audiophile,3cwuz2,Huspah16,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:21:35 2015 UTC,"Hey all! My father recently gifted me a pair of JBL L112's that he bought new back in the early 80's and had kept stored in the basement for the past 15 years under the presumption that the low frequency drivers were shot. Obviously after a quick re-surround they were back up and running but now I'm faced with the issue of how to drive them properly.   From what I've researched so far these things can handle a lot of power and as I'm still a college student who enjoys playing music a bit too loudly I think (maybe mistakenly) that 100 WPC+ is a must. So far I've looked at some of the monster vintage receivers (pioneer Sx-1250), a modern day Peachtree Nova 220SE which is nice for a built in DAC and lack of a tuner which would hardly get used.   I've also thought about going to separate amp/pre-amp and DAC components, like a crown PS-400 amp and some modern pre-amp/dac combo as long as I can keep it around my budget of $1600USD.   I mostly listen to classic hip/hop, alternative/electronic rock, along with traditional rock like the stones/ Led Zeppelin or some vocal heavy simon and garfunkel all streamed off a computer or apple TV.   My hopes for the system are that it can both entertain kids for house parties while still sounding enjoyable at moderate levels while my buddies and I are hanging out and relaxing. Sorry for the slightly convoluted message but basically I'm looking for some way to drive these things well for under $1600, any help is appreciated. Thanks!"
audiophile,3cwuz2,zim2411,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:49:06 2015 UTC,"Based on what I found here, the L112's roll off pretty quickly below 50 Hz. You're not getting a ton of bass extension despite the large size. If you really want to spend your money wisely, a beefy amp isn't really the answer. I'd personally go for a standard AV receiver like a Denon or Marantz and a pair of subs to handle bass. I'd cross the JBLs over at 60 or maybe 80 hz. Those subs will blow the roof off and provide way more overall system impact than throwing even this monster at the JBLs."

I also want to add a small sub to the setup. I don't know if this matters but they all have an 8 ohm impedance and require 5W of power. I'm hoping it could be something that isn't too big preferably without a screen just a power switch and a few dials. They are all speaker wire and only plug into the amp itself but I also have banana clips for them if I would need that. Thanks for any advice

I tried reading through all the posts but honestly it may as well be in Spanish. See below for details on what I'm looking for. Any advice on where to start would be greatly appreciated!   Genres listened to - mainly soundboards of bands in the jam band land spectrum Phish, Umphrey's McGee, Widespread Panic, and The Dead. I do also have a soft spot for some electric stuff like STS9, EOTO, and Lotus, so I'm thinking a decent sub would probably be a good addition? Once again - complete noob, so I'm probably incorrect in that assumption.  Areas used for listening - my living room mostly. Generally speaking I would be sitting on my couch facing the system with 10-15 feet between myself and the setup. Something that projects the best sound in a cone in front of the setup isn't necessarily required, but would be nice.  Price range - really not looking to spend more than $500, but if there is something worth a few extra hundred I would certainly entertain it.  Miscellaneous question - most of my music will either be played from an external HD or iPod, as I have around 200gb of music on my computer (desktop, can't really move it to my living room) Which of the two would be best for my situation, and would I need a special adapter or base unit to plug either into? I would like to be able to easily scroll through and pick my music. I have not bought either yet, as I wanted to hear from the experts before I made that decision. I am not factoring the cost of the iPod or external HD into the $500 speaker setup budget.   Again sorry for the rookie questions, looking forward to some guidance !   Thank you"

audiophile,3cvi2y,browsing_in_jail,5,Sat Jul 11 03:02:12 2015 UTC,"I like using Aaron Static - Severance for the super crisp percussion  But really you should probably just use songs that you love and enjoy, you can be the best judge of a system using familiar songs"
audiophile,3cvi2y,siscorskiy,2,Sat Jul 11 05:10:14 2015 UTC,"The ""white space"" that the percussion gives is really nice (limiter, cutoff sequencing etc).  I'm going from recording to just listening/enjoying, but I'll always have that recording mentality.  I love dirty lo-fi recordings for some songs, but when going to this kind of stuff, that was perfect. Tack it on to the test/burn-in list!"
audiophile,3cvi2y,faceman2k12,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:19:53 2015 UTC,"Ooh, thats some good contrast between the deep bass and the tinkling highs.  Perfect test for my new K7XX!"
audiophile,3cvi2y,mgs108tlou,6,Tue Jul 14 11:29:36 2015 UTC,I like to use the Eagle's Take It Easy because it has some really crisp acoustics that test how much detail the headphones/speakers are capable of.
audiophile,3cvi2y,WinterCharm,2,Sat Jul 11 08:00:41 2015 UTC,"I've been slowly going back in time and find a lot of late 60s/70s songs to be best for just feeling how much detail comes out of a new system.  Newer music is much more condensed to me, and the recording style has changed that doesn't have the same dynamic range.  Eagles is a great example, I'll try finding a couple tracks that give me the tingle when I realize how good it sounds."

audiophile,3cvi2y,kagoolx,4,Sun Jul 12 17:21:42 2015 UTC,What are your current 3 or 4 songs?
audiophile,3cvi2y,quadfreak,13,Sat Jul 11 03:05:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry I should have listed those in the original post.  dzihan and kamien - stiff jazz - dynamics and atmosphere/stage is excellent, and volume range variates a lot. also, play between left and right channel is great.  dj cam quartet - New York New York - stand up bass, and lots of bright punches.  Quantic - Transatlantic - just floor it and see if something doesn't seem right.  At this point I'm showing a preference for more nujazz/electro-hip-hop so here are the other two I use a lot that don't fit in that niche->  Steely Dan - Do it Again - classic no explanation necessary.  Edit (shit!) beethoven: moonlight sonata - I've had the hardest time finding the best recording of this, but I know it's out there.  Given the emotion in the music and crazy range of piano this is awesome to me.  So that's my headphone standard songs to just feel things out.  I use open-back headphones so I think I can swing a nice living room system, just thought I'd like to try out new test songs.  Let me know your thoughts."
audiophile,3cvi2y,TymotheoTymothei,3,Sat Jul 11 04:04:37 2015 UTC,dzihan and kamien- stiff jazz    So good! That whole album is great!
audiophile,3cvi2y,PaulyDeensAbButter,2,Sat Jul 11 04:25:16 2015 UTC,"I lived in Paris around 2002 and fell in love with jazzy trip-hop, as well as how well they mixed/mastered everything.  Found Dzihan and Kamien just a couple years ago and they are one of the best examples of what's inside my head I've been able to find since: hence at the top of my list when testing new equipment."
audiophile,3cvi2y,Wolfpanion,3,Sat Jul 11 04:50:12 2015 UTC,A few that I especially enjoy on my setup are:  Massive Attack - Angel Tokimonsta - Go With It Laura Marling - Night Terror Asgeir - Heimforin Nitin Sawhney - Ek Jaan

audiophile,3cvi2y,squibs,2,Sat Jul 11 12:15:28 2015 UTC,"I could rant for hours, but I'll try to keep it fairly short: I spent most of my teenage years listening to this.  My real introduction was the video ""live at Pompeii"" which blew me away.  I can't find a good full-length video on youtube though....but here's a nice example if you haven't already seen it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ2pTamaqQ4 . Audio quality is shit/compressed, let me know if there's some higher fidelity examples you know of... but I'm amazed they played/recorded in an empty auditorium from pompeii, like playing for ghosts.  Thanks for the memories, I have to find a good quality track from these guys."
audiophile,3cvi2y,fuimani,3,Sat Jul 11 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"On the rock side of things, I like to use nirvanas in utero album, and queens of the stone age, either era vulgaris or ...like clockwork; 24/96 vinyl rips. These albums are mastered really well; good mids, with tight, deep bass. I'd run something else to test the high frequencies, but these are perfect for setting up a sub, IMO."
audiophile,3cvi2y,Datsm1015,3,Sat Jul 11 13:22:26 2015 UTC,Radiohead - Everything In Its Right Place.   The first notes and bass are great for testing.
audiophile,3cvi2y,Datsm1015,3,Sat Jul 11 14:00:07 2015 UTC,"I play these albums. Sometimes just a couple of songs, somteimes in their entirety: Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon Rage Against the Machine - Rage Against the Machine Tom Waits - Closing Time Miles Davis - Miles Ahead Simon and Garfunkel - Bridge Over Troubled Water Todd Terje - It's Album Time Sigur Ròs - Kveikur Monica Heldal - Boy From the North  All of these are really good mixed/mastered and give a wide variety of styles from hard rock to electronica, jazz to folk/acoustic. They also have everything from dynamics to details to wall of sound to stereo imageing. I like to take my time while auditioning, and usually try to borrow equipment so I can use it for a day/night.  Of course if I go to a store I'll usually only bring a couple Of CD's, like Steely Dan - Aja, Jan Garbarek/Keith Jarret - My Song, Rage Against the Machine. Just a minimum to show different qualities in a system.  Todd Terje - It's Album Time is a really good album BTW."
audiophile,3cvi2y,plecostomus2000,5,Sat Jul 11 14:05:02 2015 UTC,"Most people know the popular test music around here. I've compiled a list that compliments the usual tracks and have written down what you should look for :)  here's a list of songs you should get familiar with so that when it comes to new equipment you have an arsenal of good quality music that you will be familiar with, so you can appropriately test new gear:   Atlas Air by Massive Attack - the bass goes so deep, it will destroy and destort the sound coming from a bad set of speakers/headphones. On a good set, the bass is beautifully textured, and nothing is masked or distorted. Its glorious. It WILL destroy most subwoofers, too. :P Fair warning, I cracked a window with this track while testing a coffee table sized subwoofer :D Four Ton Mantis by Amon Tobin - The devil is in the tiny 3D detials in this track. There are many. On lesser headphones and speakers, you'll never hear them. Virtual Barbershop by Q Sound Labs - the best soundstage test out there. You can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmL-YRxC6Y8 (upated to the HD link, thanks to /u/sagethesagesage) State of the Art by Gotye - beautiful, punchy, catchy, and detailed. Its quite layered but starts out simple. On a good headphone the level of clarity stays the same. On a bad headphone, it will sound muddy and distorted by the end because the speakers cant keep up.  Spies by Coldplay - beautiful. You can hear the guitar strings sliding on fingers and the imperfections in the plucking on a good headset.  Robot Rock by Daft Punk - on their live album this ones just a treat to listen to. Clarity will depend entirely on how good your headphones or speakers are.  Crystal Skies by John Stanford - there are tiny details. Listen carefully from the very start. That electric guitar should give you chills halfway through the track. (http://www.johnstanfordmusic.com/music/default.asp) Skin of the night by M83 - beautiful vocals, lots of layers, very muddy without good equipment  Drumming Song by Florence and the Machine - her voice is exquisite. Lazy Lies (clifflight Remix) by Capital Cities - listen for smooth male vocals.  Gold Lion by Yeah Yeah Yeahs - look for the echo of the drums and the crispness of the snare, and of course the smooth female vocals. Short Change Hero by The Heavy - This song just rocks. Skip to the 1:10 mark and start from there. Listen for the crisp and deep drums, and beatiful nuances in the vocals. If you dont find yourself caught up by the beat and mood of the song... set you speakers on fire and buy new ones ;) Hey You by Pink Floyd - this song has so much soul, and if your speakers can reproduce it well, the feeling is surreal and the vocals will give you chills, while the bass hits low and the guitar is crisp and clean, while still having bite. Hotel California by The Eagles - the impact of the drums at the start and the slow progression of this song into a more detailed piece will either show what your speakers can do, or bring them down to crash and burn. Alone, the complexity is nothing special, but combined with the dynamics of this song, it can be a real challenge for speakers. Look for the cohesiveness. Black Mambo by Glass Animals - really though, you'll want to keep listening. Zaba (the album) is a treat.  Carol of the Bells by Falling Up - on their Christmas album silver city, this beautiful, clean, airy take on the classic will show you how well your speakers can handle it.  Atomic Man by Portugal. The Man the drums should be clean, and shouldn't ever overshadow the vocals. The vocals should have a touch of edginess to them, as they are higher pitched. If the guitar is recessed, and doesn't separate clearly, something is wrong."
audiophile,3cvi2y,snipsortega,3,Sat Jul 11 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"So I have been finding that music that was created electronically and not recorded and then mastered really seems to sound the cleanest, obviously this is only if you enjoy this type of music and get the flac files to go along with it.

audiophile,3cvi2y,theulfberhtsword,3,Sat Jul 11 12:54:12 2015 UTC,"I actually thought of putting this one on my list for years.  I think of it as my theme song for when I moved to Europe back in 2001 from USA, lots of good separation and deep bass with sharp highs.  I might be getting a bit stuck on the more Electronic ""trip-hop"" style though...need to counter-balance with some pure acoustic/folk, which is a lot harder to record/balance from my experience.  Thanks for the reminder, this one (and the entire album) is important to me personally."

Q100 are small speakers, they aren't going to magically produce satisfying bass for those genres. The amp is perfectly fine, you won't find anything better for the money. What you need is, indeed, a high quality subwoofer.  As for this:   I want to say that I found TV/movie audio more pleasing with my previous Vizio soundbar. The best way I can describe it is that voices don't sound full (they sound flat?).   You just got used to your shitty soundbar polluting the voices with lower frequencies and making them unnaturally ""full"". What you are hearing now with your new setup is reality. Welcome to the real world, Neo.   You'll get used to it. Give it a month or two with just this setup, and you will not be able to listen to that soundbar ever again."

I was toying with the idea of replacing the Q100s with some floor standing speakers. Do you think Q100 + sub would be preferable to floor standing speakers alone? I value music over tv/movies audio, but I would like for the latter to sound nice as well.   You'll get used to it.

Try moving them further away or closer to the back wall. It could be that your listening position has ended up in a bass dip caused by your room. On my setup an inch either way makes a noticable difference."

So i guess the good way is to buy it online, then download the specific master you want or just buy the old cd's."
audiophile,3cw50e,hanssone,2,Sat Jul 11 17:49:01 2015 UTC,"Lol, all albums these days have dynamic range compression (brickwalling). It makes the quiet noises louder and the loud noises quieter. What you ultimately end up with is a louder song overall, but you lose the subtle nuances of the instrumentation as they've fiddled with each instrument's natural and dynamic range so they sound less distinct.   This mastering process began in 1994 and has caused controversy ever since. The phenomenon is known as ''The Loudness War''. If you ever come across an old album that's been remastered for its 50th anniversary, then it's been remastered through ''brickwalling''.  This is the logic that explains why I'm after original, non-remastered copies of old albums produced circa 1994. Many people have their copies and upload them to sites like ThePirateBay, but a lot don't. I was hoping there was a more specific community online dedicated to this."
audiophile,3cw50e,HollandHellion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:48:36 2015 UTC,"Just because an album is given an anniversary release post-1993 does not automatically mean that it's been brickwalled.

While the work was being done I figured I would walk down to Goodwill to see if they had anything good.  I had not ever been to this Goodwill as it is in a not-so-great part of town, and generally the locations in the better parts have better loot.  Buried in the back of the VCRs/DVD players I saw this Marantz Model 1070.  It looked in decent shape so I took it home.  (Well, first I had to walk a mile back to the shop dragging this with me).  I blew out the dust, gave it a once over and fired it up.  Everything appeared to be working so I used my Volt meter to adjust it back into spec.  It sounds great!  I just hooked it up to my Vandersteen Model 2’s and it seems to pair very well and with adequate power.  I think that is where it will stay for the time being.  Oh, and I paid $6.99."

audiophile,3cq235,guer_j,4,Sat Jul 11 01:07:55 2015 UTC,"I keep an old pair of whatever speakers (MTX currently) to hook up random finds like this after checking them. I wouldn't trust hooking up a found amp like that (assuming it had no cover on it, especially since it usually means people who ""think"" they can fix it have tried and may have made things worse - can you say aluminum foil in place of a blown fuse?) to any nice speakers without a lot of run time on some disposable speakers.  I remember an old very early '70s Sherwood receiver I picked up, tested out ok and so I hooked it up to my old test speakers. I went to get the camera which was sitting on the couch and take a picture of it to show a friend of mine, and then it just cuts off like it was unplugged and a small puff of smoke comes out of the case. Didn't do any damage that I could tell to the MTX speakers, but the outputs were fried on it.   Haven't bought any other vintage amps since then, partly because I haven't found any and because I do tire of them breaking or having problems. Well, I find them, but I think several hundred for a low powered Marantz isn't much of a good deal when I have paid similar money for much more powerful power amps."
audiophile,3cq235,guer_j,6,Thu Jul 9 23:00:01 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea about keeping speakers with you.  The unit came with the cover fully secured, I just happened to snap the picture right after I finished adjusting the pots to spec.  I turned the volume down and plugged the unit in at goodwill, saw that the power light came on and quickly turned it off.  $7 was definitely worth the risk.  When I got it home I fully checked it over and all components looked in good shape.  So I plugged it back in to try and pass signal.  I like finding deals, and probably won't pay too much for used gear, I try to stay where I can feel comfortable risking the gear being broken.  I've been playing music for about two hours now and it has run perfectly."

Storage auctions out there can be pretty lucrative as well.   For high-end gear you're right, most folks would want new stuff rather than used anyway - but for those rare sets that aren't made anymore and just don't show up on the market -  that's what I'm talking about.   again, it all depends on what you're looking for  and how bad you want it. If I find an old sherwood power amp or something for $20, that's totally worth a tank of gas to me.

audiophile,3cucs2,enichols81,3,Fri Jul 10 22:30:41 2015 UTC,"Memory as in RAM in the device itself, or as a storage medium (like a hard drive or SD card)? RAM would only affect devices that operate in the digital realm, and it would also only really affect things if it starts to degrade and can no longer accurately store the binary representation of the audio. This is (probably) equally likely to any given bit wether it's the most or least significant bit. So a lightly corrupted memory stream may result in a ridiculously loud blip, or something totally inaudible, assuming there is no error correction systems in place and the DAC is just playing back the raw PCM stream. But, this is really not something you need to worry about unless you're playing PCM off really shitty knockoff SD cards with minimal/no error correction. Digital corruption, when it does happen, is often quite obvious."

audiophile,3crhrp,aquastream,2,Fri Jul 10 04:41:29 2015 UTC,the speakers should theoretically sound the same but may receive less total power on load depending on the model of reciever. The content on the surround speakers will not be the same as the front unless you have all channel stereo or mono on.
audiophile,3crhrp,psychojeremy,2,Fri Jul 10 05:56:44 2015 UTC,"I'm simplifying a bit for clarity, but here goes: It really depends on the content you are listening to. If you are listening to a standard CD or radio, for example, which play in stereo, you will only get sound from the front left and right speakers, and probably the subwoofer, depending on how the receiver is configured (2.0 or 2.1).  There are various surround formats, but the point of surround is that the different speakers are given different sounds to immerse the listener in whatever they are listening to (or watching).  So, watching a movie that is encoded for surround sound, regardless of whether the speakers are identical, you will get mostly dialog form the center channel (you refer to as a bar), other up front sounds from the left and right, and then background noises and directional sounds from the surround speakers.  An ideal surround system would have all 5 speakers the exact same to achieve perfect timbre matching.  The only reason the center is a bar in most cases is to fit above or blow the screen; it is a compromise."
audiophile,3crhrp,mpelleg459,2,Fri Jul 10 11:06:38 2015 UTC,"The speakers will sound the same if they get the same signal.   If you change your receiver settings to ""extended stereo"" then the right two speakers and the right half of the center ""bar"" speaker will all play what you hear out of the right side of headphones. And the left side will behave the same way.  Or you can turn on Dolby PLX2, which attempts to convert stereo into simulated surround sound... Etc. etc.  So hardware wise you're fine - you can hook up the same 5 speakers to a 5.1 channel receiver. But what comes out of each one will depend on the software settings."

Even after calculating crossover parts, full assembly, etc. he still spends 2+ weeks breaking in the mids (loosen suspension, new surrounds and spiders can be quite stiff) and listening/measuring for anomalies especially at varying distances, angles, etc.  He did the same thing with my center channel and the result is the best sounding setup I've ever heard, period."

First few I bought were their 'sound cylinders', which were a budget model featuring a sonotube consctruction instead of nice mdf/vaneer truncated pyramids, but they used the same omni drivers from their higher end. The Pro 250 models (biggest ones they made) were absolutely incredible and I still regret selling them to this day.     The I's are kinda weak, as are the II's but the 2xo models are pretty dialed (same cabinet for all three), especially paired with left/right Hsu TN1220's subs :)   There are several others, but I'd keep an eye out for 2xo, 3's or 4's depending on your room size. Model F are highly collectable, but spendy and problem prone and model A's belong in museums.

I remember several months ago I was looking at Vandersteens for around that kind of money. Closest I've had to old JBL speakers were HPM-100s, which were probably the least impressive sounding speakers I've ever had. I did hear some '90s JBL speakers, the more high end ones with the titanium tweeters and could not bear the highs.  The only metal dome speakers I've enjoyed are my current B&W's, others always sounded too bright. Infinity EMITs can be nice too, depending on the model."

There are very select few vintage speakers I'd pay much for since speaker technology has gotten much better over the years. Which isn't to say there weren't great old speakers, I recall a really nice sounding set of Celestion speakers I had from around '79-'81. But I've had quite an assortment of speakers, I find the stuff from '90 on up to be the most pleasant with nice imaging. I heard an old set of KEF reference speakers from the early to mid '80s and while pleasant they didn't have the imaging. clarity, or bass response of the B&W speakers which I compared them to (Which are circa 2004-2006?).  JBL speakers are a mystery I apparently won't ever understand, much like Klipsch. But then again, I detest bright speakers and I'm not a fan of tube amps, and I've heard at least for classic Klipsch that they were voiced with tubes and tend to sound bright on solid state. I remember distinctly I was looking at a set of Vandersteen 2CE Signature Mk IIs for $650, I cannot imagine a better value for the money - though I haven't seen another set in many months now, if my listening space could have supported them I would've bought them after how wonderful they sounded. The seller did not want to ship them and didn't mind cutting the price a bit as well to move them along."
audiophile,3cojk6,henry3369,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"Any time you are double amping, the audio signal is degraded and it isn't going to sound as good. Besides that, when you hook active speakers up to an amplifier or receiver you run the risk of frying your amp or speakers. I don't know that the fiio is powerful enough to damage your speakers, but you would be better of not taking any chances and it wouldn't sound as good anyway. If you can use the e17 by itself and bypass the amp through a line out to use it as a DAC only that would be fine.  You should  only hook active monitors up through a preamp or standalone DAC."
audiophile,3cojk6,dillont3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:28:29 2015 UTC,So does it continuously damage the amp/speakers or is it something that can potentially happen? I'm ordering a DAC soon and want to know if it is okay to use the E17 and E09K temporarily.
audiophile,3cojk6,dillont3,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:52:21 2015 UTC,Connect your monitors to the pre-out connection on the e09k and  you will be fine. Since it has a pre-out it will bypass the amp on the e09k and you will not be double amping. When the e17 is docked it is being used as a DAC only so you will not be using the amp section of the e17 either. No need to buy a standalone DAC.
audiophile,3cojk6,dillont3,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:44:06 2015 UTC,So I can't use the headphone jack on the E17 while it is docked on the E09k? I can't connect it to the E09K yet because I'm waiting for a longer cable to be in stock on Amazon.
audiophile,3cojk6,dillont3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:37:46 2015 UTC,"Because I would need a 1/4 inch to RCA cable, correct?"
audiophile,3cojk6,dillont3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"Yes you would need a 1/4 to rca or XLR to RCA cable, depending on what connections your monitors have. You could probably do that a couple times and not damage your speakers,  but there is no reason to. If you connect  your speakers to the headphone out on the e17 or e09k you will be bypassing the DAC and only using the amp portion. So all you are doing is double amping without utilizing the DAC and it will not sound any better. Probably will sound worse and you are taking a risk of damaging something. You would be better off connecting your speakers to the headphone jack on a computer  or cell phone until you get the correct cable."
audiophile,3cojk6,BranFlake5,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:01:56 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm not sure that you are bypassing the DAC using the headphone out, but you would definitely be using the amp section  and it is more likely to sound worse than better. I don't think the headphone out on the e17 will do anything when it is docked. You could use it without being docked, but there won't be any real benefit and it is more likely to make things worse. Still better off using headphone jack on computer or phone for now."

audiophile,3cojk6,BranFlake5,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:43:53 2015 UTC,"As I said before most likely not.

Probably won't hurt anything. Try it if feel the need."

audiophile,3cplyy,SirMaster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, but now I have a new question.  I transcoded one batch directly from FLAC to MP3, then did a separate batch from FLAC to WAV to MP3. Both batches were done using dBpoweramp and all settings were the same, yet the file sizes were different.  The directly transcoded ones were 41.4mb, yet the decoded then recoded were 41.1mb. How is this possible?"
audiophile,3cplyy,Diablo-D3,2,Thu Jul 9 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"It's almost certainly the case that the directly transcoded ones retain metadata (ie, tags).  My guess is there's a jpg of the album cover hiding in there.  Most transcoders don't attempt to transfer metadata to WAV files, so you're losing the tags in .flac -> .wav conversion, but dbPoweramp makes sure to retain the tags when converting .flac -> .mp3.  I would assume the actual audio data is the same."

I did not think that there was a huge difference between them other than the super transparent bass that the Blades had.  I always felt that a subwoofer never quite blends well as well as the bass from just Blades, could be a setup issue.  I felt the same with the B&W 802 when the subwoofer was off, less of it but the bass blended in.  With the Blades the bass was never in your face but there was tons of it, something the LS50 could not do.  Everything else was the same to me, but I never heard them in the same room."

audiophile,3clnyq,strategicdeceiver,3,Wed Jul 8 22:47:32 2015 UTC,"Crossover networks do more than just crossover drivers with a slope, they also correcting driver response issues and usually mess with phase to achieve desired results.

audiophile,3clnyq,smashey,2,Thu Jul 9 01:41:44 2015 UTC,"Passive components can't delay a signal. Delaying frequency bands allows incredible control over spatial response. It also allows for perfect phase response should it be desired.   Passive components can't amplify a signal, so the system efficiency has to match that of the least efficient driver.   Passive components are OK for midrange to treble crossovers but dsp is really necessary for state of the art bass reproduction."

audiophile,3clnyq,At_least_im_Bacon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:26:19 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Conversion stages have a noise impact bit the benefit is that your able to narrow your bandwidth to a specific frequency range vs the broadband impact of your Gaussian noise through passives.  It comes down to broadband noise power vs active noise power + frequency specific noise power.   Active will always be more expensive but there there are times where a 3db reduction in noise can make a big impact on a large signal change.

In fact, if there are any mega-priced speakers that comes close to justifying its retail price, the KEF Blade series definitely come closest.  IIRC, KEF aren't making that much off the price because they threw many millions into researching the design - a bit like the Bugatti Veyron and how VW loses money on each sold - and each Blade is still hand-assembled (with the aid of precision tools, of course) at Maidstone, Kent.

I live in Romania, so things are more expensive, and I can't get my hands on some headphones.  Source: Asus Zenfone 2, maybe Fiio E10k, but they have to sound good with my phone.  Req. for isolation: Some. A lot would be nice, but it's not something I absolutely need. If it isolates as well as my Audio-Technica SJ33's, then I'm happy.  Preferred type of headphones: Over ear, could handle on-ears, don't want IEMs.  Preferred tonal balance: I'd like some extra bass, but the mids and highs must remain clean.  Past headphones: I like the HD 598's, but I wanna try something with more bass. The SJ33's sound muddy, while not being much bassier than the 598's. Can't complain for that price though.  Preferred music: Metal, rock, electronica, rap, j-pop, jazz in no particular order.  What I'd like to improve: I want a closed pair of headphones that has a mic and button on the cable. Some more bass would be nice.  EDIT: Forgot to mention, I'm looking at the AKG 545, from what I've read they're pretty much exactly what I want. What do you think?"

Mids and highs are great, clean with a great soundstage and clear separation of instruments. I always advise trying out headphones before you buy them if you can, but I reckon you'd enjoy the K545."

I'm buying a DenonAVR-S900W or Yamaha RX-V677 after much research and they meet pretty much my every need, aren't super high priced ($379 on Amazon) and seem to be near the top on all the audio sites recommendations.    So now that I have my receiver, I'm looking to get some good speakers. I'm looking for a 7.1 (maybe 7.2?) solution. I'd prefer a wireless speaker solution, if it's possible...but the options that I see online are spotty and most ""serious"" audiophiles never recommend it. I just find it a bit hard to believe there is NO good option out there for a wireless system (much like wifi lags behind hardwired, wifi solutions can be great and do the job for MOST people...I'm hoping this mentality applies to speakers as well).    My budget is a bit open...but I'd like to keep it under $500-$600 (best bang for the buck the better obviously..I wouldn't say no to a $400 system that's only marginally worse than a $600 one). I'd prefer a 7.1 setup, but I'm open to 7.2 if the price is right. I don't mind buying refurbished from a reputable seller..but I'd prefer new. Also, I don't mind if my front speakers/sub are wired...as long as the side and rear surround are ""wireless."" The reason I use "" "" is because I will have a power outlet near the back of the room, since I know that's a necessity to get decent sound from wireless solutions.    I hope someone here can help me. I'll crosspost to /r/hometheater as well if that's a better forum for this question.

audiophile,3cn6cs,dr_torque,3,Thu Jul 9 05:47:23 2015 UTC,"A DAC is a digital analog converter. Your computer or phone has music files that are in a digital format. Your speakers or headphones need to receive the info in an analog format. The DAC sits between them to convert digital info to analog.  An amplifier increases the amplitude of an analog signal so your speakers or headphones can play music at a louder volume.    A very common setup is like this:   [computer] --[usb cable] --> [DAC] --[analog RCA cable]--> [Amp] --[speaker wires]--> [speakers]   Another common setup is like this (this is probably what you have):   [computer (DAC and amp in motherboard) ] --[3.5mm plug headphone cable]--> [headphones]  Your computer's motherboard already has a built-in DAC and amp. That's why you can plug in your headphones into the back of your computer in the green 3.5mm jack and listen to music without buying a separate DAC and amp.   A separate DAC might be useful if your computer's DAC does not sound good. You plug in a DAC into your computer, usually with a USB connection, and your computer will send the digital signals into your standalone DAC rather than the DAC in your motherboard or soundcard. You will then also need an amplifier after the DAC, where you will plug in your headphones or speakers.  A separate amp (without a standalaone DAC) might be useful if your built-in amp isn't loud enough to drive your headphones to a listening volume. It'll look like this:  [computer (DAC and amp in motherboard) ] --[3.5mm to RCA cable]--> [amp] --[3.5mm headphone plug cable]--> [headphones]"

One way you could get around that is using an optic line.    When you go directly from your computer's headphone jack and skip the fiio and dock, does it still have interference?

A dac might help or not.  An optical line transfers the audio signal as pulses of light, to be turned back into electricity on the other side. So no electrical interference can go between the two sites.

audiophile,3cmd10,AiryDiscus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:42:04 2015 UTC,"The peak-to-peak voltage of a +4dBu signal should be 3.472V.  This is the standard in pro audio because of the long cable runs and associated voltage drops.  Many mixers will go as high as +6dBu without clipping and the voltage gets eaten across many hundreds of feet of cabling, so it is frequently referred to as 4V.  Consumer audio at -10dBV is .894V peak to peak nominal."
audiophile,3cmd10,PriceZombie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:47:50 2015 UTC,"Whoops, I only thought about reference voltages and not what lines are actually run at. Forgive me, you're entirely right"
audiophile,3cmd10,Herbejo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:54:57 2015 UTC,"Also, on the manual it says: ""Connect consumer equipment with unbalanced outputs to the 1/4 TRS input of the speaker using unbalanced signal cables."
audiophile,3cmd10,Herbejo,2,Thu Jul 9 01:49:40 2015 UTC,"To fix the buzz when nothing is plugged in except the D plug, you need a ground loop isolator.    A ground loop occurs when there is unwanted voltage and/or current on the ground line.  This bleeds into anything you plug in, and with an audio device it produces a buzz.  A ground loop isolator is usually a diode perhaps with a capacitor wrapped around it that allows power to only flow one way, in essence functioning like a single ended isolation transformer.    This particular one is rated for 6 amps, so I recommend that you do not plug a power strip into it and then both speakers into the same one, since that could draw more than this is rated for.  That also does not protect you from dirty power feeding back from anything else on the power strip.  One per speaker is ideal, but perhaps buy one and see if it solves the buzz with nothing connected first.  If it works, get a second for the other speaker.  The buzz coming from the computer is some form of interference.  balanced connections will solve that but balanced sources are expensive.  Your adapter cable probably touches the left and right channels ever so slightly or gets them very close to each other, similar to plugging a cable into a speaker/amp and then touching the other end with your hand.    Get the signal into a single cable for each side - both channels should never be in the same wire wrap.  This will help solve interference.  If you still get it even when connected over a very short distance with short cables, you can try a galvanic isolator for the DAC to isolate it from dirty USB power."

Even worse are the few people who think I'm being a hipster by using some old vintage amp instead of a bluetooth speaker or dock or whatever. I take offense at those remarks, I've been into audio for the enjoyment of the music long before hipsters were ever a thing - although I must say, in the last few years when I've sold off some of my old upgradeitis stereo stuff I've seen some people who strongly came off as hipsters.

The design both technically and aesthetically is pretty incredible, and if the signal processing they are doing works half as well as the white paper claims, I'd imagine it sounds incredible.   They really should pair this with some room correction software as well, if you got the dsp in there already it seems like a logical progression. With that kind of bass bandwidth you're going to hit a node somewhere, and I'd imagine if you integrated the room correction prior to the speaker correction stage it would sound even better than conventional room correction techniques."

Explain to me what, even with my medium-to-good equipment at home, I can actually hear that I can't possibly hear with regular CD quality. And please, don't throw around ""analogue"" as a buzz word, as if the mere presence of something that was analogue during the recording process makes high-res audio worth it automatically. By all means, record your instruments and analogue sounds in high-res studio formats, but then do your job and master it to a format that I can play easily, and that doesn't rely on reproducing frequencies my ear physically cannot hear anyway.  I'm not against the concept of high-res, but I am against the selling of it as if it was a substantial step up from CD-level audio.

It's just plain idiotic. People are debating whether these details are audible in quiet rooms with high-end equipment, what makes anyone think playing high-res audio through a phone and (hopefully) closed headphones suitable for public transit or the like, would be worth it in any way, shape or form?  My biggest facepalm moment is whenever I see promos for Pono, where Young is riding around in. his car. while playing ""high-res"" music, and a completely stunned whoever stumbles out in the end, flabbergasted by the quality.

audiophile,3cjpfv,dr_torque,-6,Wed Jul 8 18:42:40 2015 UTC,Yup high frequencies lead to a lower latency! You're not going to notice the latency on a home system or headphones but when you have a huge system latency is certainly a huge factor so 96khz is chosen since it's twice as fast removing any latency issue.   http://imgur.com/gD61Ny8  I hope that roughly explains it.
audiophile,3cjpfv,HamburgerDude,11,Wed Jul 8 18:47:47 2015 UTC,"Dear me. Whilst latency is a real problem with large scale live sound, I'm pretty sure sample rate has nothing to do with it. We're talking about digital transmission comprised of zeros and ones: Increasing the sample rate from 48 Khz to 96 Khz merely means double the amount of zeros and ones are squirted across in the same time period of one second.   Edit: I wonder if you've got the idea from the latency vs frequency equation with RAM."

But until this electrical AC signal is converted into sound waves by the speakers frequency has no effect on latency. Once the speaker has produced the sound waves, there is a theoretical difference in speed with frequency that's nigh on imperceptible."
audiophile,3cjpfv,dr_torque,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:05:44 2015 UTC,"Small ripples aren't faster than large ripples, they have more frequent harmonic modes so they appear to oscillate faster.  The wave itself isn't even real, it is the displacement of water as a result of energy transfer.    Higher frequencies don't travel faster, if they did the ideal of constant phase in speaker and amplifier design would be daft, yet instead it is a key component to the ""soundstage"" of something."

Then he goes and releases Sound City on CD as a distorted, low dynamic-range, brick-wall compressed mess. Someone out on the interwebz took the time to rip the vinyl to flac@16Bit/44.1KHz, and it's a world of difference. While I can always appreciate top notch audio, this guy has motives that I can't trust. Bumping bit-width or sampling rate is not a fix for bad mastering.

It looks like a plate amplifier?  If my thoughts are right, there should be connections on the other side of the plate - do you see the actual electrical workings of the amp?  If so you should be making the connection there to the subwoofer/shaker, probably via a quick disconnect terminal of some sort - would need to see pictures to better guide you.  Normally high-level outs are to your actual L/R speakers so you can use the internal adjustable crossover to help integrate the sub properly.  These should not be going to the sub if my suspicion is correct."

audiophile,3clsjs,Shike,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, this is exactly what I thought.  The red and black wires should be going to the shaker.  I would suggest housing the plate on an enclosure and use another biding post plate to connect those wires from, but if you're doing a quick test you could cut off the very tips (the quick disconnects) and plug them directly into the shaker.  Set the crossover on you Cambridge if possible to something like 80hz, and slowly increase volume while playing something with lots of bass.  So basically the ideal solution is plate on box that protects electronics/people that may get shocked > wires in box to new binding post plate > Plate to shaker.  For the test you can just route the wires directly.  Do NOT use the high-level in/out on the back.  Let me know if this doesn't make sense or if you have more questions."

Lets say my budget is in this neighbourhood.    I listened to this at the store; sounded great with the CD the sales guy put in (obviously running some . Didn't get to try it on some internet streaming samples, which in all honesty, is where the bulk of my listening pleasures will come from. Space is tight-ish in my condo, will stick to bookshelf size speakers for now.   Proposed use: Day to day - Music streamed via Spotify or music library via AirPlay; Weekends, special times - Vinyl. Music tastes -  all over the place, classical to guitar solos to hip hop to the occasional bass drop. If you told me I could only have one, see [here[(https://youtu.be/6g-6qMaLT5U?t=4m28s). TV audio would go through this as well.    Other notes: Tried pricing out tube amp + DAC, comes out a bit more, and I may have to make more concessions around my inputs. No real reason for consider tube other than it gives me the grins and remnants of guitarist snobbery - would probably fail a blind pepsi challenge today but if all else the same I'd be a happy guy if I could dim the lights and bask in the tube glow.

audiophile,3cjujt,Spach-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"I recently picked up a pair of JBL LSR305s to use with my computer. However, I have been getting a high-pitched hum through them whenever I plug them into my PC. I have tried plugging them into a separate outlet and I believe I have determined that it is not a grounding issue, rather a soundcard issue. That being said, I am considering buying an external DAC to try and fix the problem but I have no clue what to look for. Also, I tend to use a headset with my computer and sometimes play vinyl over my turntable through the LSRs (without issues); so a DAC with 2 inputs & 2 outputs might be necessary. Thanks!"
audiophile,3cjujt,dr_torque,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:35:41 2015 UTC,Are you looking to listen to your turntable through headphones as well?
audiophile,3cjujt,Spach-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:00:11 2015 UTC,I am looking to listen to my turntable over the speakers if possible. I have a cheap preamp hooked up to my turntable right now as well if that changes anything.
audiophile,3cjujt,dr_torque,2,Wed Jul 8 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"Well, if listening to your turntable over headphones isn't important, you could get a USB d/a converter like this one. The LSR305, if I understand correctly, takes two inputs, a TRS and an XLR. You can use one to connect the output from the Fiio, and the other to connect the output from your phono stage. If you'd like to listen to your turntable on your headphones as well, this is a great buy - you can connect the output of your phono stage to the line-ins and then connect your speakers directly to it. With both options, if you'd like to control volume without having to reach behind your LSR305s every time, you can get this."
audiophile,3cjujt,Spach-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:15:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for your help! I think I'll pick up the E10K and the Control Freak as those suit my needs perfectly. My only issue is that the headset for my PC requires a headphone jack and a mic jack for gaming. Would it be possible to just use the headphone out port on the E10K and the mic port on my PC?
audiophile,3cjujt,dr_torque,2,Wed Jul 8 17:34:41 2015 UTC,It certainly would!

audiophile,3cjujt,thecross,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"The best passive closed back headphones I've heard are the NAD Viso HP50's. They don't have active noise reduction, but their passive isolation is pretty good. They are also quite efficient and easy to drive. Unfortunately they are also the smallest ""around ear"" headphones I've used. They just barely fit.  If you really want active noise reduction, the QC25's are an obvious choice. They sound OK at best, but the noise canceling is second to none. The build quality is also quite good."

There does not seem much out there for the North American market. I have found the Yamaha R-N500 but read that it lacks omph to play rock. I mostly listen to metal so it's a bad start. Next i found the Peachtree Audio Nova125SE that would fit the bill except that it's much more expensive than I had in mind ($500-$1000). Any other suggestions?"

That said, the nova, as far as I know, has no network capabilities, isn't that what DLNA is about? There's also nothing about the Yamaha R-N500 that makes it unsuitable to ""play rock"" - your speakers are fairly easy to drive at a rated 90db, although this website has measured them differently. This version, an update, puts out slightly more power than the R-N500 (20 wpc more) if that helps to allay your concerns."

It won't do more than 50mW per channel, but that won't be a problem unless you have some orthodynamic headphones or some balanced armature IEM's.  You could always go for the Schiit Fulla which is a reasonably priced DAC/headphone amplifier for about 70 euro."

If not it's transparent which is as good as any other DAC. There's not a lot that you can get wrong when manufacturing a DAC but interference from other equipment is usually the issue that comes about in cheap ones.

audiophile,3cg65i,Arve,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those are good points.  I really love the idea of active devices to change reflection coefficients, it feels a bit like isobaric loading but for an entire room. just casual impressions"
audiophile,3cg65i,Salmon_,5,Tue Jul 7 20:46:24 2015 UTC,"I don't believe in declaring things impossible. If mankind stopped at the possible, we'd still be living in caves! However, you have a tough task in front of you...  The big problem I see is the distances between the source (snoring pig, like me!), the microphone, the loudspeaker, and the restless spouse (my poor wife).  Active noise cancelation works really well in a headphone, where you can pick-up what the ear would hear right next to the ear, and then add in its opposite signal to acoustically cancel out the original sound.  When you space things out you are no longer picking-up what would be heard at the ear of the other person.  Even if you did use a microphone at the person's ear, trying to cancel that signal with a loudspeaker situated some distance away would be tough. The time delay would limit you to low frequencies, which probably aren't the main problem. And as soon as the person rolls over the distances change....  If you solve this problem you'll have a very nice patent, and my wife as a customer!"
audiophile,3cg65i,v2guy2,2,Tue Jul 7 18:46:38 2015 UTC,"In regards to the microphone being around the person's ears, we've thought of possibly using a headband that the ""victim"" could wear that has the microphone as well as the components inside to transmit the signal to a DSP unit and speaker. Of course the challenge there would be to get something as unobtrusive and comfortable as possible since wearing a headband with electronics in it could be just as uncomfortable as someone snoring right next to you."

audiophile,3cg65i,Stubb,3,Wed Jul 8 01:53:43 2015 UTC,A relevant project might be the C-130 cockpit noise reduction system. It uses an array of microphones and speakers to deaden propeller noise.
audiophile,3cg65i,Salmon_,3,Tue Jul 7 19:37:29 2015 UTC,"first off, you dont calculate the opposing frequency, what you want is your sound wave having the exact same amplitude and opposite phase at the eardrum.  from a signal processing perspective, what you're trying to do is find the transfer function of the loudspeakers, the room, and the users head. you then take the reciprocal of this transfer function, have the incident (snoring) wave with a 180 degree phase shift as your input, and you should get perfect cancellation. in one exact spot. if you move, the snorer moves, or the speaker moves, the transfer functions change. this means that you need to be constantly recalculating/measuring the transfer functions.  so what are the challenges?  measuring the snoring signal (it should be measured at the ear drum) will be difficult. one possible solution to this is an attachment to the users head, a microphone that both tests the loudspeaker signal and the snoring signal and attempts to keep the two as canceling to 0. because of the different position of the ear drum and the mic, this wont mean perfect cancellation at the ear drum, but it should be reasonable. the closer the mic is to the ear drum, the better the cancellation. this does lead to a confusing conclusion - the best way to make this work is placing the mic in the users ear. if you're doing that, why not just use IEM's with active noise cancellation? they'll be cheaper and likely more effective. And of course, just as annoying to use.  if you dont want to go that rout, and want nothing placed on the users body, then you have a bigger problem. because the user is lying in bed, their position and orientation relative to the pillow and blankets changes. these will very significantly change both the rooms transfer function and the heads transfer function. how you would go about compensating for that, i do not know. to put it in perspective, characterizing the transfer function of a persons head is difficult enough that I suspect you'd get a research paper or two out of describing the technique.  I'll be completely honest, it's a very cool idea, but the project is ambitious to say the least. I'm currently in the process of choosing a project for my final year of uni, and if someone suggested that to me I'd flat out refuse, I cannot see any way it could be reasonably done in a way that is less intrusive/cheaper/more effective than earplugs/IEMs with active cancellation. but, if you have ideas, all power to you.   best of luck, I think you may need it."
audiophile,3cg65i,Salmon_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:57:03 2015 UTC,Unfortunately we had no real choice in the matter. Groups and projects were randomly assigned based on multiple factors. It sucks but that's the way it goes.  I appreciate this explanation. Definitely helpful.
audiophile,3cg65i,sia_rezaei,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"I should also throw out there that given that this seems to be a solution for multiple people in the room, with one snorer and 1+ 'victims', i cant see any way to make sure that an effective solution for one person would not simultaneously sound annoying to anyone else in the room, including the snorer. it would sound notably louder than the snoring on its own to anyone other than the user. assuming you're going for strong canceling for one user instead of damping over a region.  it may be possible using arrays of speakers and microphones to get some damping over the area of the pillow(s), but this is really a stretch. what you could do would be install a bunch of speakers in the ceiling and walls, and do some initial calculations for each room.   you ever brought a home theater receiver and set it up? you place a microphone and the systems makes a bunch of test tones. the idea im suggesting is similar. basically, a few test mic positions on the pillow, along with a test speaker in the snorers position, and the actual system speakers and mics installed, then play test tones and do maths. compared to the home theater receiver, this setup would probably require a bunch more speakers and a bunch of mics, and the maths would be utterly brutal but i could see getting some damping over a region."
audiophile,3cg65i,Marvin_Dent,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:11:27 2015 UTC,As explained by others what you are trying to do is very hard.  One alternative and a more practical solution that is used in similar situations is called Sound Masking. This is where they mask the noise with another (less noticeable) noise instead of cancelling it.  Google it :)

Around $200 there are plenty of options in the audio video and stereo reciever range, which have both-but they would be too big most likely-unless you could fit it under the desk.  FYI most good entry level headphones don't need a separate amp & can be driven just fine by your pc or MP3 player. It depends on how high you go if you need a separate amplifier."

It's not like what you have is very high end, but that's kind of a useless question without us knowing the alternative. If you're looking for an improvment without spending too much up front, I'd keep the Onkyo and the sub and just put a couple hundred into new fronts. Obviously we cannot suggest which fronts without knowing more.    Are bars and/or wireless speakers good enough now that I won't have to rip up the walls running wire in my new place?   No. They are awful."

I'll be pairing them with a NAD 316BEE.    What HiFi gives the Diamond 220 the ""best under 200 pounds"" award, saying they're superior to the Dali noting more nuance and refinement, however I'm a little uncertain after the Wirecutter's review prefered the Dali, saying it had a more open soundstage.  They didn't seem particularly impressed with the 220, calling it ""boxed in"" and closed sounding.    The other consideration is if the Diamond 10.2 (which is the same price, roughly) with it's 6.5"" driver would be a better choice.  Size of the speaker isn't really an issue as they're going on stands, and my amp is plenty powerful.  I don't know if the bigger drivers on these would support a fuller sound, or if the technical improvements in the newer model, the 220 would ultimately make it the superior speaker.  Of note, I'm not currently in the market for a subwoofer, as I'm already stretching my budget here.    Thanks for the input!"
audiophile,3cfca5,mpelleg459,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"You can read all the reviews in the world, but there is quite a bit of subjectivity in what most people will prefer, especially among fairly similar speakers.  Also, it is difficult to anticipate how a given speaker will sound in a given room/placement.  I only know of a couple of retailers (and several ID manufacturers) that have a generous enough return policy (in the U.S.) to let you check out speakers in your home, so your best bet is to go and give them a listen for yourself if there are stores near you that carry these speakers; take recordings with you that you are very familiar with to facilitate the comparison.  Sorry I can't give any better advice, as I've not heard these particular speakers.  I have found that the subtle difference you may notice in listening to 2 sets of fairly similar speakers in quick succession in a store is much greater than the difference in enjoyment that the speakers would give you at home; that's a complicated way of saying that those are all quite good speakers for the price and you will probably be pretty happy with any of them."

They will be sitting on my desk by my monitors so they'll be fairly close to me but sometimes I do like to sit far away or lay in bed while watching movies or shows. That said, they'll mainly be used for movies/shows and music. I don't really need them for gaming as I usually where headphones when I do game. I don't really require a subwoofer but I do enjoy songs with bass so if there are any 2-set speakers that will do the job just fine and are cheaper, that would be awesome.

In all honesty my suggestion would be to save up for something like the Micca speakers and a Lepai amp, or drop that $50 on a good pair of headphones. You can get better quality for the money on cans at that range than you can on speakers. AKG K240's sometimes dip into the $55 range on amazon if you watch the warehouse deals and are some fantastic cans for that price.  That said, if you really want new speakers now for $50, I've used Logitech stuff before and it will suffice for a while and can be resold pretty easily when the time to upgrade comes around."

audiophile,3cfloq,EntireSiteFromOrbit,13,Tue Jul 7 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"The audio coming out from your sound card is always at a fixed bitrate.  For a system configured for 16-bit audio at 44.1 kHz, it is 44100 * 2 * 16 = 1 411 200 bps = 1411.2 kbps.  The 320 kbps you're talking about only ever exists as an abstract representation of the sound data before decoding.    If your purpose for doing this is to compare the system output data to the 320 kbps original, be aware that when you import an MP3 into something to audacity, it is decoded before it's displayed to you.  In that case, the software you're looking is called Virtual Audio Cable - which is a virtual audio card that you can use to reroute audio information.  You'd typically want to record it into something like Audacity.  That said: Doing this is pointless, as the audio data will remain the same in the mp3 loaded directly into Audacity and in the captured stream.  If your purpose is recording an unprotected internet radio stream, you're normally just better off piping the radio stream directly to a new file.  If your purpose is recording radio from a service that employs DRM - such as Spotify, Tidal or Apple Music: I'd suggest you forget about it.  While the Virtual Audio Cable+Audacity solution will let you record the stream, you can't compress it to 320 kbps without inducing further losses in audio quality."

For those who don't know, it's a Walmart-sized store with nothing but massive blue bins full of unsorted, filthy junk. It's where the trash from Goodwill goes. The shit of the shit that doesn't sell at Goodwill makes it to the Outlet. I was so shocked to see this there. Everything in the store is sold for $1.39 per pound. That ads up real quick when it comes to quality electronics. There was no power chord that came with this so I couldn't test it out before purchasing, and needless to say there are no returns. I figured it probably wasn't worth the risk, but decided I'd make up my mind after weighing everything out.

audiophile,3cb8jo,beepboopblorp,2,Mon Jul 6 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"Well, they did use to rate things with IHF back in the day which was not a very accurate measure compared to RMS (Kind of like the old way they rated horsepower on cars). I know what you're getting at though, like a typical modern day Sony or Pioneer AVR where they're rated at 110 watts x 7 but it's with one channel driven or something and the actual output is more on the order of 60 watts or so. Kind of sad that the watt wars in the 70s really made everyone think an amp was garbage if it wasn't at least 100+ watts so that now every amp has to somehow get those numbers lest consumers think it's not powerful enough...  Just didn't want someone to conclude from this that ""vintage watts are better"" which I have seen people say unironically. Power rating is a power rating (assuming we have the true output of an amp), so a 50 wpc vintage amp will not be any more powerful than a 50 wpc modern amp."

audiophile,3cg38e,Arve,2,Tue Jul 7 17:42:36 2015 UTC,I've used this exact kit. Foam repair on a speaker will make zero difference in sound from the original foam. Go ahead and fix them and enjoy your quality speakers for cheap! :)
audiophile,3cg38e,wizzy453,2,Tue Jul 7 18:21:17 2015 UTC,Ordered. I'm not a very crafty man . . . how would you rate the difficulty on the task of installation?
audiophile,3cg38e,wizzy453,2,Tue Jul 7 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"Just follow the directions. Use a safety razor (like for scraping decals off windows) to eliminate the rest of the foam from the housing, then clean up the bits of leftover adhesive with some rubbing alcohol. The old foam likely mounted to the back of the cone, but the new foam will be glued to the front.   It just takes a bit of patience. Once you apply the glue, you have to use your fingers to go around and around and around the edge to keep pushing the foam down as the glue gets tacky. After a minute or two, it will set up perfectly. An hour after you do the job, you can be listening to your speakers!"

Is this common for this model of speaker? I was expecting a connection that was easier to remove. The lighting wasn't the best, and my eyesight isn't what it used to be, so i'm going to double check in a better workspace tonight . . . but if this is the case, i'm just going to have to replace the surround while the speaker is still in the cabinet. Would this be a mistake? Sorry to bother, but i want to make sure i get this right."
audiophile,3cg38e,bissimo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"Not a bother at all. It is possible that it is directly soldered. Most speakers use blade connectors, but if it is directly soldered I would recommend de-soldering if you can. Trying to place the foam with the speaker connected would be a nightmare.   If you don't have a soldering iron or aren't confident enough in your soldering skills, you could always clip the wires and strip the ends and use a wire nut or crimp connector to re-connect them when you are done. There is nothing special about the wires themselves."
audiophile,3cg38e,IQBoosterShot,2,Thu Jul 9 19:13:52 2015 UTC,"Make sure the speakers are laying on their backs when you replace the surrounds.  If they are standing up, the cone might sag and not be centered properly."

audiophile,3cg38e,Jonlaw16,2,Wed Jul 8 15:39:50 2015 UTC,Do not use them until you repair the surrounds! You can do serious damage to them. The surrounds keep the cone centered. Using them runs the risk of damaging the voice coil.

audiophile,3ceny7,Arve,2,Tue Jul 7 11:36:42 2015 UTC,"There is no easy way to tell whether that hub is powered.  The best suggestion is to just try it - but make sure (in Device Manager on Windows) that it identifies as a USB 2.0 device.   As for latency: no - it won't - most of the latency in USB audio devices is in the device itself, and the driver you're using - I'm running a USB audio interface off a powered hub, and have no human-detectable latency whatsoever - I've been running with as little as a 32-sample latency into a DAW when tracking guitar."

audiophile,3ca4ks,AuburnM5,10,Mon Jul 6 08:09:18 2015 UTC,"wait.....so you bought THOUSANDS of dollars worth of mcintosh equipment......and you completely bypassed the preamp and used a matrixing upscaler to listen to audio?  this is like one of those posts where someone buys a subaru STI but stances it with giant chrome rims and slams it down so low that its undriveable. (/s)  all joking aside though, dts neo 6 works so much better than pro logic 2. i was pretty damn surprised.  EDIT: OP responded/explained in comments below, he's doing it right."
audiophile,3ca4ks,ss0889,7,Mon Jul 6 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"Other way way around. The preamp is used only for 2 channel music, it is has a pass through mode for watching movies or surround music. Whenever I want to listen to have a 2 channel music session, the C2500 is the only one handling the source material. The MX121 processor is used for everything else."
audiophile,3ca4ks,ss0889,2,Mon Jul 6 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"ah ha! makes sense.  does your direct TV not support multichannel out? or were you just listening to a stereo source when this was taken? I generally keep my receiver in ""auto"" mode, so stereo comes out 2.1, multichannel gets the correct decoder applied (dts-ma, dts, dd, etc). the ""movies"" dts-neo6 tends to work a lot better for TV, as it makes all the dialogue come out of the center and spreads stereo out over the remaining channels."

audiophile,3ca4ks,rhodesman,4,Mon Jul 6 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"well, the preamp looks (to me) like it is completely arbitrary and doesnt need to exist in that signal path. generally you go through a preamp before a power amp. for some reason this guy goes through a preamp into ANOTHER preamp (in the form of the av receiver).  if nothing else he should be going av receiver (dac stage) to preamp to power amp (again, the receiver).  Also, watching direct TV (which already broadcasts in 5.1 dolby digital) in upscaled matrixed 5.1?  i think OP has the money but not the time to read the manual"
audiophile,3ca4ks,rhodesman,0,Mon Jul 6 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"I dunno, maybe he's using the tube to ""soften"" the signal?  I do this with my headphones and computer setup because the digital to amp is just to ""crisp"" and hurts my ears when listening to more technical tracks.  Having the tube in the middle helps to soften the signal and give it a slightly more organic sound.  Now, with that said, you could achieve this a lot cheaper than OP is but if it's about aesthetics, I would side on OPs side if cost was not a factor. I ended up using my Mac system in my living room not because its the best place for it, but because it looks the best with the decour in the room, when in reality, it would be better used in my game room with a newer HDMI receiver in the livingroom."
audiophile,3ca4ks,dorekk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"Ha. I completely understand the aesthetic part. My wife fought me hard on having them all out in the open. Before switching to the Macs, I had an all Meridian setup and it was hidden in a closet. I do miss some things about the G68 processor though.   I can't get enough of dimming the lights and seeing all glowing blue meters. I even ended up getting the LED conversion kit from Audio Classics for the two MC352s and the MC7205. Now they match the new C2500 and MX121. I do need to put a damn gate around them because my 1 year old son seems to be obsessed with them too."

What are you using the C2500 for?  I have the D100 for processing all digital signals and the MX151 just processes the surround while the AMP obviously provides the power.  I could see the C2500 being used for Vinyl input and possibly a passthrough for the D100 to make the analog more ""organic"" (did this on my desktop headphone setup) but that's a hefty addition for just that purpose!

So, watching TV, movies, or multichannel audio discs, the MX121 is the processor and the C2500 is in pass through mode. Whenever I want to listen to any music in a 2 channel format, the C2500 is used. This could be streaming, music on Mac Mini, Vinyl, or CD.

audiophile,3cdk9v,patricktlo,3,Tue Jul 7 02:03:30 2015 UTC,"An amp can't really ever give you ""better"" sound (in an objective sense).  It can only ever damage the sound less than other amps.  The goal of most amplifiers is to provide enough power so that it doesn't distort driving a headphone at normal volumes.

I've built probably half a dozen headphone amps - everything from all-tube, tube/SS hybrid to full SS.  In terms of cost-to-performance I'd heartily recommend a build of AMB's 'CK²-III' (Cavalli-Kan-Kumisa III) headphone amp.     Sound quality is excellent with recommended components - I can't reliably tell the difference between it and the considerably-more-complex-and-pricy Beta22.  The noise floor is actually lower on my CK²-III. Project cost is relatively low for the quality Project complexity is fairly simple - both channels and the PSU are on the board so you only need to worry about I/O wiring. AMB (one of the designers) has superb documentation and support available.  He has detailed instructions on stuffing the board, biasing, case installation, etc. If you're having trouble with your project you can contact him on his forum and you'll probably get a response in less than a day.

That said, to attach it to the desk I would DIY something out of some 3/4"" black steel pipe from HD or Lowe's and a few fittings. The fittings are the expensive part, but I bet you could pull it off for less than $50. If you don't mind bolting it to the desk you'd be pretty well off this way. If you insist on clamping to the desk things get a lot more complex.  My best idea for clamping it to the desk is to find something like a monitor stand that is designed to clamp to a desk and retrofit it for speakers."

audiophile,3cc4si,WingerRules,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:55:20 2015 UTC,I figured I would have to do something like this. Would mounting the trap on the wall behind the couch do the trick? There is about 2 feet of space between the couch and wall and that's where I hear the most low end.
audiophile,3cc4si,bradAHA,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"It's always a bit of a trial and error game but based on your description, that is probably the most likely culprit"
audiophile,3cc4si,WingerRules,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:11:49 2015 UTC,"Most effective positioning depends on the room, but is generally easy to reposition. Also they have these which should be easy to hide behind your couch (if thats what the issue issue is). BTW, generally 1 trap doesnt do it for low end... my room's bass null didnt improve much (everything else did though) until I had a number of the 244 & monster traps in, which can look kinda crazy in a small room. If you can measure the room, their tuned membrane traps should be much more effective relative to the number of traps.  Also If cost is an issue, these types traps can be relatively easy to DIY. Generally its Owen-Corning 703 compressed/stuffed down between wood planks or chicken wire and then wrapped, with a spacer that makes a 3 inch or so gap to the wall."
audiophile,3cc4si,sia_rezaei,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:38:29 2015 UTC,"This effect happens in every room. It's called the boundary effect. You will always get louder bass at the boundaries of the room. Here is a good article about it.  Bass traps will help if you have a node or a peak at a specific frequency at your listening position, but I doubt they'll help in your situation. As v2guy2 mentioned, sound absorbing material might help by absorbing the midrange and making the bass sound louder relatively."
audiophile,3cc4si,v2guy2,0,Mon Jul 6 22:31:51 2015 UTC,"There is a reason.  The room boundaries cause a bass boost near them.  Think of a small wave in a swimming pool.  As the wave reaches the edge of the pool and runs into the wall, the height of the wave doubles as it bounces off the wall.  This same thing happens to sound waves that bounce off the walls of your home.  Putting the speakers closer to the side walls will help raise the bottom-end, but would probably destroy your midrange and imaging.  Damping material on the wall behind the speakers should not affect the bass response, but if it absorbs some lower-midrange it might make the bass sound louder by comparison.  Your best bet might be to tweak the bass tone control to your liking.  The ""best"" setting is what sounds best to you!"
audiophile,3ccpyk,Call_Me_Salamander,4,Mon Jul 6 22:02:01 2015 UTC,"Ideally, you shouldn't even ""hear"" a subwoofer; in a hifi setup, subs are used to fill out the bottom few octaves that your mains can't or can't ideally reproduce. The transition should be seamless, and simply sound like your system extends further down.  As for the settings, you can't really compare these apples-to-apples. If you're adjusting the preamplifier volume - that is, the sound going into the sub - then you could increase the gain on the subwoofer to make up for that. If you're adjusting the gain on the sub already, then vice-versa. These things aren't made to reproduce a ton of the spectrum like arse-putty PC subs are designed to, but you can get the same effect by low-passing the sub and high-passing the mains much higher, probably around 120Hz, at a fairly large cost in quality."
audiophile,3ccpyk,fuimani,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:09:23 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks for the detailed post!  Since you seem to be knowledgeable on the subject, I had one more question. Is there a good way to test if my crossover is working as expected? I have the crossover set to ~110 Hz but it sounds like the Audioengine A2+ is also trying to play sound below 110 Hz along with the subwoofer. I was reading online that I may need to buy a separate crossover device to fix this issue."
audiophile,3ccpyk,fuimani,3,Mon Jul 6 22:13:41 2015 UTC,"You'll need what's called a high-pass filter for the mains. Most recent AVRs can do this, or you could get some sort of DSP to do so. I would recommend you cross over much lower than you are right now, as you want your subwoofer to reproduce only what the mains cannot reproduce competently; 70 or 80Hz would be much better, as then the sub has to focus on a much smaller range.  Now, if you need a midbass hump around 100 or 120Hz, then you'd want to cross over that high, but you'll compromise your lower and sub-bass quality. Totally up to you."
audiophile,3ccpyk,fuimani,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:19:14 2015 UTC,Okay sounds good! I will look into purchasing one.  Why does the sub include a crossover then if you need to purchase one anyway? Is there a way to set it up such that I could simply use the crossover on the sub with my Audioengine A2+ without buying anything extra?
audiophile,3ccpyk,Josuah,2,Mon Jul 6 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"Your subwoofer only has a low-pass, which attenuates the signal above a certain frequency. While you could, in theory, high-pass a signal by cancelling it out with a low-passed signal (although I doubt they would align well enough to give passable results), your sub features no outputs of any sort, so you need to high-pass your mains through other means.  Another thing you could try is simply not crossing over your mains, and moving the crossover on the sub to their F0, which is the point where the bass response starts to drop off. On the A2+, that would be around 65Hz, and since these are ported speakers, they natrually roll off at 12db/octave - lining up well with the subwoofers 12db/octave low-pass. You should be able to get a ""flat"" response like that without doing anything to the signal going to your mains, meaning you can try it out and decide whether or not you like it without spending a dime."
audiophile,3ccpyk,Josuah,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:28:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for all of the help! I'll try that as soon as I get home and see how it sounds.

audiophile,3ccpyk,cavortingwebeasties,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:42:22 2015 UTC,"When you pick a crossover frequency, it's not a brick wall. The sound rolls off starting at that frequency. That's the way it is supposed to work.  BTW - a cheap way to check if you have the sub phase settings correct is to get a SPL meter, play a sine wave tone at your crossover frequency, and pick the phase setting that gives you the highest SPL."

audiophile,3cavw7,elamo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:12:37 2015 UTC,I bought a pair of last-gen bookshelf HTD Level Three speakers on craigslist.   Would a SMSL 2x20W amplifier be enough for these? What difference might I notice by moving up to the SMSL 2x60W amplifier?
audiophile,3cavw7,thesneakywalrus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"At a sensitivity of 88dB, 20W should be fine. Now, those T-amps don't put out the rated wattage, probably 10-15 in this case, but that's still enough.  A 60W amplifier would give them more headroom, but shouldn't be necessary for normal operation."

I figure I can just leave the balanced connectors plugged in with the headphone AMP off when using my speakers.  Correct me if I'm wrong here.) The Gungnir has two low level outputs on it.  I'm going to run one to the A5s and preferably one directly to the Sub rather than from the output on the A5s.   (http://schiit.com/public/upload/general/gungnir_01_05.jpg)  Budget - ~$400 max  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
audiophile,3cavw7,thesneakywalrus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:49:16 2015 UTC,"Just about any subwoofer that accepts unbalanced RCA will work, your logic of using the XLR for your headphone amp and the RCA out for the speakers and sub is correct.  The only problem in your scenario is that you will not be able to set up the crossover properly, as the Audioengines will receive signal from the source.  I would suggest a subwoofer with a line in and line out that will be able to feed the audioengines only the higher frequencies. Something like the KRK10s would work fine."
audiophile,3cavw7,das_throwdis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:18:33 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the info.  One question: Would I be able to manually adjust the crossover just to the natural cutoff on the speakers?  I'm a little hesitant to connect the speakers through the sub.  I could be totally wrong but I figured running them through a low pass filter would affect the sound in some way.  The DAC is pretty good so I don't want to attenuate the signal if at all possible.  (I could be toootally wrong that this will affect it in some way.)"
audiophile,3cavw7,thesneakywalrus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"I could be totally wrong but I figured running them through a low pass filter would affect the sound in some way.    It absolutely will affect the sound in some way, that's its job. A quality low pass filter isn't going to add distortion to the signal, hell, there's already a crossover in your A5+'s splitting signal to the woofer and tweeter. If anything you'll get clearer sound out of the speakers, as they are no longer attempting to reproduce the low end.  You don't want the speakers and sub playing any of the same material, this is going to muddy the sound quite a bit as one of the sources will hit your ear a split second before the other. If you had a   high pass filter on the audioengines, you could get the same effect by setting both filters to the same frequency.  However, yes, you can set the crossover on the sub to match the natural cutoff of the speakers, though you will likely either hear the gap or the overlap depending on what frequency you decide on."
audiophile,3cavw7,das_throwdis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yea, I definitely meant distortion.

When auditioning a set you can try and replicate the situation in your home, you can take different listening positions to see how they behave in a weird angle, you can spot where the bass ports are and maybe place them close to a wall to see what that does. A good store will be able to guide you given clear information about the room and if you are at home and not satisfied, they'll give you your money back. Get this clear before you purchase anything.  About room treatment, a little bit of carpet and some pillows in the couch are pretty simple. If you have some big clean walls you could try the effect of placing a nice plant, cabinet and/or a painting just to stop refections. You don't have to resort to specialized bass-traps right away."
audiophile,3c7nz2,fauxnick,3,Sun Jul 5 17:58:54 2015 UTC,"Requirements for a good room If you plan on using really nice speakers:   Having enough space for your listening position to be at least 4 feet from the back wall. Your speakers need to be 4-5 feet from side walls, and 2 feet from back walls, 3-4 feet from back walls with a rear ported speaker. You should have at least enough absorbing material to drop 20dB after 150ms. This is normally accomplished with a couch, and some curtains, and a rug or carpet.  The room needs to have ventilation so that the bass energy has somewhere to go, a hallway that leads to the rest of the house is good enough to spread most of the energy around. No coffee tables, or any structures in between the source and the destination."
audiophile,3c7nz2,strategicdeceiver,2,Mon Jul 6 05:05:56 2015 UTC,"a)  False, the right good speakers will usually be worth it - think of the room and the speakers as a ""system"" in itself conceptually and you'll get a better idea.  Depending on the speaker amplifier requirements can vary, in this case depending on the room speaker requirements may vary.  b) False, focus on designs that reduce the room impact or offer benefits.  Depending on the room you can choose a general array of directivity patterns to figure out what sounds best.  Sometimes you can use the room to your advantage such as with omni directional speakers or constant directivity (CD).  Sometimes you may want it to ""beam"" in comparison, and there's of course patterns that emphasize horizontal dispersion killing vertical in comparison.  The only time there is a major issue if there's room nulls that you can't get past that entirely ruin the sound.  Any peaks below room transition can always be knocked out with a good parametric EQ, finding a speaker that plays well in terms of the reflections will allow you to control the rest.  c)  Some people may prefer this solution, it's not an end all."
audiophile,3c7nz2,Shike,2,Sun Jul 5 23:23:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say there's no point in throwing any sort of real money into equipment when your room is just flat out horrible and full of reflections you can't easily fix.  If, however, the room is at the very least not utter shit acoustically, go wild. You'll still have fun. Keep in mind though, that room acoustics are king, and a $5,000 system in a well treated room will destroy a $500,000 system in a shitty room."
audiophile,3c7nz2,sky04,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"no matter how bad the room is, go ahead and invest - Um big speakers and tiny room is a bad idea - other than that  - as long as the speakers aren't facing the wrong way you'll be enjoying good sound."
audiophile,3c7nz2,pbaldovin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:05:53 2015 UTC,I'd say no matter how much money you spend on accurate drivers if your room causes your listening point to have frequency loss or gain (ie no bass from standing waves or harsh treble from massive reflections) it's not going to sound right.
audiophile,3c7nz2,tekprimemia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:09:12 2015 UTC,Speakers that have good off-axis response and careful positioning can make it so you can still get a pretty good result in a room with poor acoustics. Playing at lower volumes will also help.

audiophile,3c9fby,trevorj98,4,Mon Jul 6 03:11:56 2015 UTC,"Short Answer:Yes  Long Answer: It depends on the gear you are using. If you have crappy speakers, don't assume a DAC will fix that. I'm assuming you don't have B&W speakers lying around, otherwise you would probably already know about DACs. DACs are usually regarded as one of the last things that needs to upgraded in a setup. Most modern phones and computer have competent DACs to a certain point. And if you aren't using high-quality sources (MP3 320, FLAC, WAV, DSD...) a DAC will do even less for the overall SQ.  They have a purpose. They aren't selling you something that does nothing. Invest in some good speakers/headphones before looking at DACs. Remember that they are the things that actually produce the sound. You wouldn't put a V12 Engine in a Prius. The Best DAC can't fix the worst headphones. (No Offense to the Prius, that mileage is fantastic)"

audiophile,3c9fby,skatedudeact,2,Mon Jul 6 04:13:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm not good with car analogies, but there is literally one for everything."
audiophile,3c9fby,BranFlake5,0,Mon Jul 6 04:30:46 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind as well is pretty much everything integrated into phones/computers is also amplified, so to get unmolested sound you need an external dac. You don't have to break the bank though. The only reason I'd upgrade my Modi is to get balanced outputs (thinking of getting the Emotiva XDA2)."
audiophile,3c9fby,Astrognome,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:44:24 2015 UTC,"Expensive DAC's are marginally better than cheap decent DAC's, so it really comes down to connectivity needs and ensuring there is no noise in the audio. As for sound quality, if you have crappy onboard audio then definitely get something decent like a Schiit Modi 2. But if you have good onboard audio like in today's motherboards (Realtek 1150) then it will suffice. DAC's are the last place in the chain I would upgrade, and I am saying that after buying a $300 DAC. Getting an external DAC is better as there is less noise and it can be portable when compared to soundcards."
audiophile,3c9fby,BigTerminator,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:37:03 2015 UTC,Technically your motherboard's audio output is also a Digital to Analog Converter. Manufacturers choose off the rack so to say components for their boards. Their focus is even at best not what you would call audiophile grade. It's like a video card . For power you can't expect integrated . That's what USB pci etc is for.

audiophile,3c9fby,sh3rog,2,Mon Jul 6 07:33:41 2015 UTC,Look into integrated DAC/Amps you will benefit much more from a headphone amp if you don't have one already
audiophile,3c9fby,dannyd1999,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:05:43 2015 UTC,"It depends, what are you connecting your HiFiMAN HE-400's too? If it's a computer and all you have is an onboard sound card, purchasing something like an ASUS Xonar DGX or Xonar U7 (If you prefer external rather than internal) will make a noticable difference as compared to onboard audio it provides much cleaner and more pleasant sound in general (Less distorted), and they also feature a headphone amp which your headphones can also benefit a bit from. The Xonar DGX is really cheap so you can just buy that and see if you like it, if you're using a laptop or you just want a USB solution get the U7 (it's a bit pricier, but has a better DAC and is of higher build quality)"
