pitchforkemporium,3db19v,autowikibot,2,Wed Jul 15 01:08:17 2015 UTC,"Endothermic process:       In thermodynamics, the term endothermic process describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings; usually, but not always, in the form of heat. The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo-, derived from the word ""endon"" (ἔνδον) meaning ""within"" and the root ""therm"" (θερμ-) meaning ""hot."" The intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on taking in heat if it is to proceed. The opposite of an endothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases, ""gives out"" energy in the form of (usually, but not always) heat. Thus in each term (endothermic & exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs, though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes, which need not necessarily be heat.     Relevant: Exothermic process | Ammonium persulfate | Lattice energy | Ammonium nitrate   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.
