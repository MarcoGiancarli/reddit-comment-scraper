ottawa,3e2f3e,EugeneMJC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"Alright, let's do the two second Google search numbers game!  First, start with ""ottawa census numbers"". You can go with I'm Feeling Lucky on this one because the first link takes you right to our 2011 census numbers.  A little reading, it's quite interesting really, and you will find the Families and Households section. And by that number, there are 240,000 families of some type. Pull out the 40,000 from the single parent families and we have 200,000 families(married or common law) in the city.  If you just assume each account is unique, we have just under one person per family trying to cheat on each other.  Yeah, I think we have to assume some number here is bad, and I'm guessing the census numbers are not the problem.  Let's do some more Googling: ""cheating rates in canada by city"", didn't find what I want, and most of the answers are just ads for our original data source. Filtering for that(append ""-ashley -madison"") and we find this nice infographic from the National Post: http://news.nationalpost.com/news/graphics/graphic-the-demography-of-adultery  Looks like the real rate is between 12% and 23% for cheating. Well crap, those numbers are not too out of line with what we are seeing. If half the accounts were fake/duplicates/whatever, we could see the title calculation actually getting right into the middle of this range.   Throw in the singles who are looking to meet people who are already attached and you can account for much of those numbers. 330,000 single adults can really ad up too. Say 12% of them are prepared to be involved in cheating, and you get those numbers even closer.  This is not the result I expected when I started this post, this amuses me.  Then we figure out that we are normal, just like everyone else.  Just for the record, I've never cheated, and I've never had an account with Ashley Madison. I'm not trying to hide anything or excuse behavior(I generally disagree with cheating, but am fine with consensual behaviors)."

Not surprised sadly ... the work on Sussex has kinda screwed over anyone along that stretch. Been two years of solid work now?
ottawa,3e2pzk,kall-e,2,Tue Jul 21 18:51:23 2015 UTC,"The construction work may have had some effect, but a bridal salon is more of a niche market than a regular clothing store.  It's not the kind of place you could just walk into and go shopping anyways, it was by appointment only.  Once when I walked by I saw a couple teenagers try to go in to look at prom dresses (apparently they sold those too) and they were practically shooed out of the door.    When I was looking for my wedding dress last year, I looked on their website and their starting prices IIRC, were in the $5000 range edit: CBC reports starting prices of $3500, and could go up to $10,000+.  The insane costs for the dresses (and snooty attitudes) may have been a bigger factor in their demise than the Sussex construction."

ottawa,3e4gnw,inkathebadger,3,Tue Jul 21 21:53:06 2015 UTC,"What do you want in a car? (hatchback/wagon? automatic? air-con? cruise? good on gas?)  I have some general suggestions, as someone who has bought and sold used cars, from dealers and private individuals.  Set a budget; maybe a ""stretch"" budget as well for the right vehicle.  Use the ""Lemon-Aid"" Guide and only buy cars on their ""recommended"" or ""above average"" lists. Avoid cars on the ""average, below average, not recommended"" lists.  Here are the small cars on those, from a recent-ish guide:  Recommended   Honda Fit (2009-2010) Hyundai Elantra (2007-2010) Mazda3 (2006-2010) Suzuki SX4 (2007-2009) Toyota Echo (2000-2005)   Above Average   Ford Focus (2005-2010) ...watch out for rust but if oil sprayed every year these aren't bad, IME. Honda Civic (2010) Honda Fit (2007-2008) Likely one of the best on this list. Hyundai Accent (2006-2010) I really hate these cars. The 2011 and later models are much nicer but don't make the list. Hyundai Elantra (1999-2006, third generation) I love these and have owned a 2002 and 2006. They drive like much, much more expensive cars but are heavily discounted compared to Japanese models. IMO, you get Japanese quality at Detroit prices with third generation Elantras. Mazda3 (2004-2005) Mazda5 (2006-2010) Mazda Protege (1999-2003) Nissan Sentra (2007-2010) (I'm omitting the Subarus though they're on there... skip AWD, get dedicated winter tires) Suzuki Aerio (2003-2007) Suzuki Swift (1999-2009) Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe (2005-2010)   Watch out for model years. A number of cars on the above lists make the ""not recommended"" or below average lists if they're out of those years. (Matrix/Vibe 2002-2004)."

We've been eyeing a couple Hyundai's again but we aren't set on a brand.  I do a bunch of driving for work, picking people up and shuttling them to events. My toddler still uses a car seat so 4 door. Decent trunk space would be nice. Stick is an option (and honestly what we are leaning towards this time cause they tend to be cheaper), I can sorta drive stick (I'm out of practice) and my partner is a pro at it and is itching for a stick car this time.  Also cars that I can change the fucking oil filter on myself without having to take a rusted panel off.   Fair on gas also a bonus."

The powertrain was all Toyota).   My father has one, and I envy him. I have gone through various cars, and his is just running perfectly, and it's a 2004 with 175K km.  Literally, change oil, rust proof, do all the regular maintenance and enjoy. Amazing gas milage, lots of carg space (plus bonus rear plastic lined cargo area with tie downs etc). Really, it's a great car (as much as I hate to admit it.). Basically a hatchback corolla.   From MY personal experience, I will tell you what car to AVOID at all costs: Any ****ing VW, especially Mark 4 era (1999-2004). Just stay away from German cars overall, but especially VW. I've had a few, maintained them really well, bought from original owners etc... Just pure crap.  Side note #2: avoid dealers, really. Try to find an original owner, private sale, and check out how the person is (like their habits, how they maintained it etc). Dealers often hide things that are more serious."

I've never been on a horse before, and my girlfriend had a little experience ~8 years ago in a different style (English style where legs bent, high stirrups vs. Western style at Captiva) At Captiva, we got a little introduction to how to approach and treat a horse, then were taught how to get on and off. Then we went over basic commands like stop/go/turn.  After that we went on a trail ride in the beautiful Gatineau hills. The horse I was riding made me look like a pro (or I just picked it up really fast?). It was a lot of fun.  After that we had lunch in Wakefield (Café Pot-Au-Feu). Delicious!"

ottawa,3dzc4d,hagunenon,6,Tue Jul 21 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"Ashley Madison, the first cheating site on the Internet, was founded by Darren Morgenstern, a 45-year-old high school dropout from north Toronto with an entrepreneurial bent. In 2000, after a few years spent flipping domain names on the Web, Morgen­stern was casting about for a new business to start when he noticed a gap in the market for dating. Amid the flourishing of such sites as Lavalife and Match.com, there was nowhere for would-be philanderers to go. Or, more specifically, nowhere for them to be above-board and unapologetic about their desire to get a little on the side. Adultery, unlike pornography, had no destination on the Web. And yet, the Web was its perfect realm."

ottawa,3dzc4d,Stellarific,12,Mon Jul 20 20:08:35 2015 UTC,"So its ""good"" that a website that has people's personal and financial information is breached and those peoples information may become public, people who haven't broken any laws, because their personal life choices may be considered morally unsound by others? Is that what we've come too?  I think cheating on your spouse is wrong.  I think you're opinion on this matter is worse."
ottawa,3dzc4d,mackinder,-10,Tue Jul 21 03:12:38 2015 UTC,"Whoa, punctuation. Yes, it's good because some of these people will be forced to come clean to their partners regarding their affairs before it blows up, because if this didn't happen then why would the cheater feel the need to come clean? I just don't understand - ""people who haven't broken any laws""... what? Sure, there's no law that says don't cheat, but um, does that need to be a law? You could say it's a moral/ethical law. Society doesn't need a law for every aspect of life, some things should be common sense, for example, don't cheat on your spouse. Everyone these days just feels so entitled and happy go lucky in that they think they can get away with anything. I am 110% against cheating and there is absolutely nothing anyone can say that will convince me otherwise. Just, no.   P. S. Your opinion on my opinion is your opinion."
ottawa,3dzc4d,Stellarific,5,Tue Jul 21 03:45:48 2015 UTC,"i do think cheating is wrong too but people are going to cheat regardless of whether or not this website had anything to do with it. But the part that you don't understand, is that it is dangerous to give out information like that. Just because you don't agree with what a person is doing doesn't mean you have to ruin their life or put them in jeopardy."
ottawa,3dzc4d,bright__eyes,8,Tue Jul 21 04:50:08 2015 UTC,"I too am 110% against cheating. If you have issues in your relationship that compel you to ""cheat"" you should address them rather than hurt someone you once loved. That doesn't justify vigilantism.   There are some people that feel other lifestyle choices are morally and ethically wrong. Maybe it's porn consumption, homosexuality, drinking, swearing, eating meat, atheism, etc.   and before you say that most people condone the list above but frown upon marital infidelity, remember that in a metro area of 1.3 million people there were 189,000 users of just one website catering to these folks.   You sound like someone who has been burned by a cheater, or fears that it may be happening to you now."
ottawa,3dzc4d,mackinder,-4,Tue Jul 21 04:28:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, I may have been burned in the past, but that doesn't change the fact that everything you listed is something that hurts no one but the person themselves. Cheating, however, hurts someone else who deserves much better than that. There's no valid argument that can change that."

My opinion may be a bit biased here because I am studying to become a childbirth educator - but I think that you might benefit from having a birth doula as they have a wealth of knowledge on pregnancy and birth and can provide you with support throughout your pregnancy. It certainly isn't in everyone's budget, as it can run you anywhere from $500-$1200 for pregnancy, labor, birth, and potentially postpartum/breastfeeding support, but it is an option worth considering.

ottawa,3e19xs,Thanes-Domain,14,Tue Jul 21 06:34:37 2015 UTC,"For now. Given municipal and provincial budgets, it's hard to do these kinds of projects all in one go. Extending it to Kanata would effectively double the western expansion, much of it going past a low-density area, and without existing track/Transitway to build upon.  However, it sounds like there are plans for the Kanata route to be given a (presumably grade-separated) Transitway extension. Given the current population, that should be satisfactory, but it could be replaced by an LRT in the future."
ottawa,3e19xs,ParlHillAddict,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:57:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I suppose with the transit in the east and the South being mostly covered by light rail, it would enable more busses to make trips to Kanata/Sttitsville.  However, given the growth of Kanata/Sttitsville at its current rate, we should be putting the infrastructure in now.  We'll see what happens."

ottawa,3e19xs,mayor_of_canada,3,Tue Jul 21 12:21:34 2015 UTC,Has nothing to do with the Sens...  You ever see the lineups you sometimes get on the 417 Eastbound in the morning when it bunches up near Bayshore due to Kanata traffic and then repeat that going westbound in the afternoon/evening

You have a better chance trying some bars in Ottawa. It's a hit or miss.   Your best bet, is Hull. Vieux Hull. The amount of 16's, 17's girls that go in is retarded. But proceed with caution, a lot of shady people visit those clubs to cause problems."
ottawa,3e1de7,Wojtek1,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""all-ages"" nightclubs are a thing anywhere, and if they we're, I can't imagine it would be representative of actual nightlife, or a place anyone over the age of 18 would go to.  That being said, there are some small festivals and music/rave events throughout the year that are 16+, but the major summer events have  mostly passed so you might only find niche raves that are usually very small (~200 ppl or less) and can be very hit or miss. These smaller events usually attract non-mainstream crowds (goth/emo, punk, metal,..) so that's up to you if your into that.   If you were to try your luck with a fake ID, you should do it in Gatineau across the river. Not only are there a lot of other people with fake IDs, but you will generally only meet people your own age as most 19+ will be in Ottawa where as 18 y.o (and less) will be in Gatineau. The bars and clubs in gatineau are also much more lax on fakes as that's kind of their whole audience (I never had a fake ID but I went a few times while under 18 and never got carded, and I don't look old or anything either. This was a few years ago so ymmv)"

ottawa,3e1de7,bulletcurtain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:33 2015 UTC,"While I don't really know anything about raves or all ages nightclubs, I will recommend going to Hull, but I want to emphasize how sketchy it is and also how much fun my friends and I used to have over there when we were your age. I was able to get into the bars/clubs over there when I was 17 because the bouncers didn't seem to care. On the off occasion they did care, my friends would just slip them $10 with their ID and they would get in no problem. The clubs there are just filled with girls 16-18 and guys 16-40, it seems. One particular evening, 6 of my friends and I all had our phones stolen, and the ones with purses had their wallets stolen. I would definitely recommend keeping anything in your front pocket (or bra pocket) and bringing as little as possible with you to Hull. That said, most of the nightclubs I have been to are sketchy, and this is good advice for anytime you go out at night. Hull was my first taste of nightclubs and bars and dancing and drinking and I had a really great time doing those things with my friends, and the only reason it was sketchy was because of the phone theft, which happens a lot there it seems, but it happens everywhere."

Quality of the materials from the Algonquin store is great for starting off, and I still use almost all those tools. There's a few things (like the thermometer) that I've since upgraded, but nothing that was extremely urgent. I would encourage your wife to do the same. The kit comes in a big plastic toolbox, which I hated having to carry, so I did buy a new bag that had a shoulder strap (also available at the algonquin store). Especially handy if she has to bus.   If her schedule is the same as mine, she will have two ""practical"" (in kitchen) days in a row. Buy two chefs coats, and two aprons, because if you get covered in chocolate on the first day, it's a pain to be making sure everything is clean and ready to go for the next day. One pair of pants is usually fine though, as the apron covers the worst of it. If you want to PM your wife's sizes, I could give you some of my old stuff if it would fit.   Have her buy tons of the bar mop towels (NOT the dishclothes) from Walmart. She'll need two or three per day in kitchen.   Feel free to PM with any more questions!"

There's no club that's to dirty for me. The only reason I had issues with clubs/bars is the clientele and bouncers. Here's my list.   Tequila Jacks. Girls may be the sluttiest, but the bouncers think their gods and would fight you for what ever reason. Worst place I've been. Honest Lawyers.  Thank god it closed its doors because the amount of really bad clientele is overwheleming. I once went there with my gf and her friends. Being the DD, I was sober the whole night and dragged into dancing (fun..). This one drunk black guy (not racist), put his hands on my girls hip. I lost my shit right away and must of pushed him 5 feet back. As soon as I did that, 5-7 of his black thugged out friends came to him. I knew if I would of been a pussy and walked away, he/they would try and jump me. So yolo, I stood my ground, had my hand closed into a fist and ready to go at it. Thankfully, I was friends with the bouncers and they helped me by kicking them all out. One of the bounceers got sucker punched. This resulted into them waiting for me outside. They eventually gave up.  Bop. Bop is semilar to Tequila Jacks but the guys are a bit more louder, pushier and every time I went over to Bop there would be couple fights. A random guy ""accidently"" sliced my giant's friend hand. He was a juice head and would simply not let that fly. He took his VIP bottle of Vodka and smashed into him.  Think it hit his back/shoulder. It did a good job of cutting him (both were wearing white Tee's and it looked like a blood show). We stayed, they left.  Mansion.  Good times, can be either boring or good. Went to the mens washroom and was followed by two pretty asian girls. Me drunk, urinating in the urinal, looking over to my right were the sink was, the two asians looking back at me asked if I wanted to do them. I stubble over to them and ask ""Oh ya? and where would we do it?"". ""They point to the toilet seat area. I look over and see the floow/walls/toilet covered in freaking puke and it looked like rice mixed with orange crush puke. I laughed and walked away.  Nuden.  Nuden is a hit or miss. If your not afraid of bikers and respect them, then you should be okay. Otherwise, nice knowing you. Pigales. Exact same thing as Nuden. Except a lot more bikers.

ottawa,3dvqj1,trinity_girl2002,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:38 2015 UTC,The bin colours aren't hard to sort out.  What is hard to sort out is    Not having your neighbours steal your fucking bins Having the WM crew Actually empty them.   So far I've been in my house for 4 years and I think only a handful of times have they actually emptied my garbage bins.  99% of the time there is some crap left in them so the end of my yard is littered with shit.
ottawa,3dvqj1,untitleddocument37,2,Mon Jul 20 11:13:07 2015 UTC,"If there is any sort of wind and your bin goes into the road or another's lawn expect it to be to stolen. This is a hard rule. It will be stolen.  There are people on my street with stacks of bins in their garage 6 high. Mine was stolen a few years ago, and instead of just asking the city for new coupons like a normal well adjusted person I instead went out at about midnight the following bin day and did some detective work to find where mine was(due to what I felt were some identifying marks)  and re-stole it back.  These are the mean streets of suburbia."

Either one will be able to direct you to a competent instructor in the Ottawa area.  I would advise that you avoid some of the other bands around Ottawa as they focus more on drinking than music (but if that floats your boat go for it). My source for this is that everyone in my family except myself is in a pipe band so I know all the ins and outs.

He's long retired (maybe even deceased by now), and my lessons were out at the school at the old air force base (also long gone).  For what it's worth, I danced with Cumbrae and Katherine Robinson, and there were a couple people who danced/taught and piped while I was going dancing/teaching."

ottawa,3dwl90,abeerkindofsir,13,Mon Jul 20 03:24:47 2015 UTC,"Hi -- I'm an Ottawan but I spent time living in DC when I was younger...  ...dude, DC is a poor man's Ottawa. You guys have effing segregated neighbourhoods there, your poor are crazy-poor, and your crime rates are terrible compared to here.   There is definitely not a limited selection of beer; the craft beer scene has gone through the roof in recent years. If your mobile requirements are not huge it's possible to do it on the cheap (though yes, Canada is expensive as that goes).   I see only two things that will suck for you: the weather. It is cold. Dress appropriately, be prepared to invest money in this. And, we do not have your fantastic Metro.   But compared to DC we are safe, clean, our neighbourhoods are nowhere near as segregated (by race or by income), and...and you can go to a lecture, hit a museum or walk around, and up near your house for happy hour.  Most of VA and MD away from the core struck me a sleepy commuter burgs? Oh boy, it's a giant shopping mall! Toronto's an easy weekend trip, Montreal's close enough to go for dinner, and there are lots of little interesting day trips to be had, though admittedly we do not have the Mid-Atlantic thing where you can just drive and drive and hardly ever see an area that's not built up.  tl;dr: we have beer. You will like it here."
ottawa,3dwl90,her_nibs,2,Mon Jul 20 03:50:33 2015 UTC,"I love the tl;dr hahaha.   Granted I don't live in DC DC, but technically a block away, in MD, so I don't experience the neighborhoods to a great extent. And for sure a 20 minute drive in VA and MD, the suburbs are sooo boring.   And I am very glad that craft is growing. That is good news for every one! :)  The weather I am getting ready for, I kinda can't really imagine it, but I try. And one of my other friends said that public transport is somewhat decent, with the buses and such.   Thank you for the suggestions."
ottawa,3dwl90,avixK7,3,Mon Jul 20 04:05:47 2015 UTC,"Yes cell phones are expensive. That is really the only downside, which applies to most of Canada.  I've never been bored in this city, but that is ultimately dependant on what it is you enjoy doing yourself. There's plenty of ""surrounding area"". Lots of outdoor activities to be had, if that's your thing. The night life isn't going to be like Montreal or Toronto, but that never stopped me and the people I spend my time with from having a good time. Plenty of decent clubs and bars. Coffee shops. LOTS of museums.   Alcohol is expensive. I'm not a heavy/frequent drinker so this has never been much of a problem. Plenty of selection for wines and such. It's subjective. Lots of microbreweries have popped up in the last few years.   Personally, this subreddit is not an accurate representation of what the city is like. The negatives are amplified, as are some of the good things. But mostly people really like to complain.   Most of us are content to enjoy our city. It's clean, safe, people are generally friendly, lots of natural beauty, we have the Rideau Canal, pretty great summers, great winters (deal with it)."
ottawa,3dwl90,bbud613,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:44:04 2015 UTC,"Thank alot for your quick reply!  I am kinda debating keeping my cell phone plan from the US. Tmobile just unveiled that you have unlimited calling/text/data in the US, Canada and Mexico from your US account. Of course you need to have most of your activity in the US. But for the 1st year, I think it might work.   I very much enjoy golf, so the surrounding outdoor areas should be awesome. I've never been much about night night life, like clubbing and stuff, just a bar to sit down with friends and enjoy a few beers.   I have been to Ottawa once when I was younger, but didn't really look around or ""soak"" it all in and such, and part of me is excited for that. And I am for sure excited to try the beers from the local breweries. I just got a bit spoiled with the selection here haha.   I appreciate the comment about the subreddit. It does feel that negatives are very much amplified, as it is in any city subreddit.   Thank you again!"
ottawa,3dwl90,thegrandtour,3,Mon Jul 20 03:53:15 2015 UTC,"While it is definitely more expensive than DC, there are TONS of choices for beers here.   The LCBO (government run liquor stores) are one the largest importers beer in  the world so you can try beers from all over the place as well as at many of the local brews in  the area.  When you are looking for a place, use padmapper.com and utilize the filter feature to show 3+ bedroom places.  There are lots of things to do here, you just have to search out where they are happening as the city is like a bunch of villages each with its own flavour but the city is surrounded by green space with bike trails, wetlands, hiking trails, etc that make you feel like you are totally out of the city.  Hope you enjoy your time here!"
ottawa,3dwl90,KanataCitizen,2,Mon Jul 20 03:46:15 2015 UTC,"Haha, well you put me at ease abit! Most of my friends when they visit from Canada drool over the selection here. But that is mainly due to a huge number of US breweries.   I have been checking out padmapper and kijiji. But I have to be there and check those places out in person.   Speaking of things to do, I am hoping to go to the Ottawa craftb eer festival at the end of August, which I am excited for!  Thank you for you answer! I hope I enjoy it too!"

That's not to say that crime doesn't happen, but when does you're not likely to find an attitude of ""Oh well, that's life in the city.""  Related to that is that there are really no areas of the city that are to be avoided. You may find a couple of ""rough"" streets here and there, but no whole neighborhoods that have deteriorated."

ottawa,3dwl90,LeSombre,3,Tue Jul 21 15:11:50 2015 UTC,"I'm somewhat skeptical on Ottawa and a bit nervous. Mostly about everyday life.    I felt the same way when I first refuged to Canada, and subsequently, moved to Québec. However, I can guarantee you, Ottawa isn't a scary place, and very easy to call home. Even though it's been a few years since I've had an address in Ottawa, I still feel very comfortable in the city.   Cell phone I heard are crazy expensive.    This is somewhat true. Depending on where you end up living and working, you might find that the cheap carriers (ie: Wind) work well for you.    I am a HUGE beer geek and am sad that there is a limited selection of beer. :(    I'm not well-versed in beer, but to my knowledge, Ottawa has a decent amount of neato beer related stuff. Some breweries, and access to local stuff. Plus, you're close to Québec, which opens up a whole new world of alcohol!    In addition to the cold, snow and etc. haha   I hate the cold. I remember hating my parents for making me move to Canada, when my cousins got to move to Florida. I never learned to like the cold, but I learned to love winter! The canal, Winterlude, skiing, beavertails, Timmies, have all become things I actually look forward to!   I will be attending Carleton University and hope to work part time. I've been a part time server for the past 5 years here, so I hope to continue that.   I also go to Carleton, and work part-time as a hostess/bar-tending. I'm a teen, and have no service industry experience prior to where I work, so if I can manage, you most certainly can, without a doubt (just make sure you have Smart Serve!). Kijiji Ottawa has a tonne of hospitality listings. Off the top of my head, I know the Works, a resto on the Canal, and some pubs in Little Italy are hiring.   I have heard that Ottawa is a ""poor mans"" DC, and can get a bit boring, in the sense that it is government town with no surrounding areas like here Maryland and Virginia.    I like to spend my time in Montréal. I live right off the 50, so it's not even a two hour drive. I like to go at least every two weeks. There's always village-esque places with shopping/restaurants, like Chelsea, Wakefield, and even Old Aylmer! I know lots of folks that enjoy that.    the awesome thing about the DC area is that you can go to downtown DC for a talk at a think tank or another institute, then tour a museum or walk around, and end up near your house for happy hour.   Many museums and galleries are located in centre town, as well as Parliament, and embassies, so you're in luck there!    What I hope to learn from this subreddit is some kind of discussion about what you love about your city.    I love the canal! It's gorgeous, and we're especially lucky to have our campus sitting by some beautiful water! I also like spending my time in China town, and the Village. I work in centre town, so the Village is an awesome mix of bistros, bakeries, and pubs that's near-by.   Sorry for the huge response!"
ottawa,3dwl90,FunkySlacker,2,Mon Jul 20 07:32:47 2015 UTC,"Ottawa has a really amazing and vibrant restaurant scene. Its a bit hidden. But there are so many great restaurants amidst all the chains.   We have a huge selection of beers if you're visiting the LCBO stores. But that's something to get used to, there's no alcohol outside of designated shops. There's the Beer Store and the LCBO. The LCBOs are basically a liquor store but they carry all kinds of craft beers, wine and of course liquor. The beer stores are owned on part by Labatt and Molson so you can only really find your garden variety brews.   There are several museums around town and most of them have a free day/time so you don't even have to spend money. I really enjoy the art gallery here.  Call phones are expensive, but there are cheaper alternatives if you're willing to look.   If you're looming for a change of pace around Ottawa, Montreal is 2 hours away and that city is also beautiful and has a very vibrant night life.  I love living in Ottawa. Its a quiet place. There's always stuff to do and see. The city runs a new festival almost every single week of the year. Blues fest just wrapped up yesterday."
ottawa,3dwl90,kaspookaboo,2,Mon Jul 20 11:12:18 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about beer, visit L'Autre Oeil in Aylmer (on the Quebec side). They have over 300 different kinds of beer, I'm sure you're bound to find one you like. :-) Also note that Aylmer is pretty Anglophile, no need to learn French to drink there.   I think the Ottawa/Gatineau region has a perfect mix of busy city life and quiet country nature stuff. You can see a show in Ottawa, go to a play or shop in the market but you can also hike/bike in the Gatineau park or go to beach."

Another thing that's great is how varied the city is, there's lush, green parks that you can wander in, the rivers and streams. Then you've got downtown with all the neat little stores (or the big retailers). I guess I like that it's hard to get bored here"

More accurately, the Mississippi Valley Textile Museum. Fascinating trip back in time.  Take the scenic route out of the city, south, along the Rideau River. You can stop in Manotick for a coffee or food, pop into Chilly Chiles, Canada's largest hot sauce store. (they sell more than hot sauce, FWIW)  Keep going south along the river and go through the village of Kars. South of there, Rideau Valley Drive South, at the 90-degree bend, is the entrance to both the Kars Aerodrome (gliding club) and the Baxter Conservation Area, a lovely boardwalk and picnic area. Oh, and they have an excellent education centre though the hours for that are limited. If you want a similarly lovely walk, the Chapman Mills Conservation Area is run by the RVCA which also runs Baxter but is located next to Barrhaven.  There's more, but that's all ya' get for now!"

It basically maps all the postings from craigslist, kijiji and a couple others on the google maps interface so that you can look around by neighbourhood rather than date posted or whatever else you can filter by.   But it also includes a fully featured filter system. USE IT!"

I just wish they'd put all the info in the right spots on Kijiji so they'd all show up, but I don't think they're really think of how their ad will show up to aggregators.  The neighbourhood overlay is a pretty cool feature. I didn't even really notice before that there's a large farm in the middle of the city.  Thanks!"

ottawa,3dw3xe,Sunneh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:22 2015 UTC,"Realistically, i just went at it on different materials and just tried it on a few pieces and different materials. I'd recommend testing whatever new paints you get your hands on and to experiment with thinning the paint. Its easier to go from thin paint to thicker so that there is less dry paint build up on the needle causing splatter.   Also learn to clean your airbrush, at first this will take 10-15 mins but its essential to keep your airbrush in working order.   I don't know what to recommend aside from youtubing airbrushing guides on plastic model kits. Paul Budzik has an excellent airbrushing series for plastic models on youtube, but there are most likely other youtube series that covers airbrushing on other mediums."

Most hated it and likened it to those annoying charity collectors, except with a bonus of ""they probably got right in your face and aren't moving"" (charity collectors generally don't block your path, but  usually stand off to the side yelling at you) and ""instead of rejected an abstract idea of a specific charity, you have to personally reject a human being."" Which is the worst. And I was just trying to get groceries.   None of us had ever been hit on while walking down the street and enjoyed it (y'know, we're just trying to get somewhere); save it for bars, clubs, and social events. Maybe bookshops and the like.

Your friends say they aren't the type it works on.  Many women do find it to be harassment because they're overly defensive due to the level of harassment they have experienced in the past in similar experiences.  They carry that experience into every situation which is unfair to the men.  I'm sure they disregarded many individuals who were just trying to be friendly because of that attitude.

Like I said, being hit on in the street is just a vastly worse version of having the 'charity mongers' trying to grab my attention. It's not about a ""history of harassment,"" it is about me wanting to get to the grocery store without having to explain to a stranger why I don't want to do X. Charity mongers at least are generally polite (no ""Hey cutie"" or ""Nice tits"", and certainly no ""fucking bitch"" if I say ""No, sorry""), stay out of my zone (and do not block my path), accept subtle and explicit rebuffs (""No, sorry"" and walking away magically ends things!), are recognizable and avoidable if I just want to get my groceries of a 36-degree day like today and don't want to chat, and don't follow me; the same is not true of dudes hitting on me."

This guy (and other disabled citizens), though they do have options (ask for help, bring a family member, etc.) shouldn't have to go through ADDITIONAL hurdles because of their disability. If there's a lack of parking spaces, it may be an issue for them as well, so we have created disabled parking spaces. If they can't open a door on their own, we should have automatic doors to assist them in doing so. Life is already hard enough as a disabled person that we should show compassion as a society and try to remove barriers, as technology and services allow us to do so.  It's not about figuring out whether he would wait a long time or not for someone to open the door; it's about not making him depend on strangers for such a simple task and being treated as an equal and respected citizen."

ottawa,3dsy9c,nxclei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:16 2015 UTC,"I really hope you're trolling me.   I don't want to remove ""free""dependence on others and replace it with ""costly"" dependence. I want disabled citizens to be able to go on about their lives with as few barriers as possible. Removing some of these barriers via technology may sometimes be costly but I think it's a cost that comes with living in a modern, respectful, empathetic society. I also like to know that if I, or any of my relatives or loves ones, ever become disabled or injured, the same technology will allow them to go on about their days with minimal problems. Providing these services / technologies does remove dependence (which is a good thing, no?) but does not ""replace"" a sense for community. I would argue that they also actually do improve our communities by allowing our disabled citizens to be more productive, more independent and to feel both at home in their own communities and respected by their own governments. They also enhance freedom, liberty and a sense of self-worth and ability. Yes, it's great when someone is nice enough to open a door, or help someone cross the road or whatever, but it's also great that technology can  allow people to do these things on their own and not have to rely on others for the smallest of tasks.

They still depend on others to install, maintain, design, etc that solution that they alone require.  That technology seems like a good idea, but it replaced something that was invaluable.  Compassion, empathy, caring, trust, respect, faith in humanity.  Instead of people wanting to help others, they can meh there's a button them.  Instead of cripples having the appreciation of those around them because they know they will help they can sit there and wait when the button doesn't work.  The reality is, they are crippled, and as a result, they are dependent on others, whether it's physically or technologically, they aren't capable of doing those simple tasks on their own.  They either need someone to hold the door, or they need to have hardware in excess of what the rest need.  You are merely replacing one dependence with another.  And the reality is, opening a door occasionally is not what stops them from being productive."
ottawa,3dsy9c,nxclei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:57 2015 UTC,"I’m going to format this response in bullet-point because I don’t want to repeat myself too much and make sure my arguments are clear. I know this will be a very long read but I hope you do go through my entire response, as I would really like to change your opinion, at least a little.   1. Technology (in general – not limited to assistive technology)  as a negative force with regards to human interaction:  Let’s take computers as an example to tackle this argument, as it is the most advanced form of technology currently available to the general public. Whether you like it or not, computers are here to stay. In certain cases, they have hindered social contact (extreme example: the Japanese Hikikomori who isolate themselves from all social contact and spend their time playing PC and console games alone in their rooms), whereas in others they have improved it, such as with internet dating, public discussion forums, etc. The very fact that we’re having this (important and interesting) discussion at all is thanks to technology. If you look for examples of the negative influence and effect of computers on social interaction you will have no problem finding a few studies and anecdotes that support this position. I would, however, also have no problems finding studies that support the position that, overall; computers have in fact improved human interaction and cohesion.  But I won’t do so because: 1) the “debate” on the effects of technology on human interaction is ongoing and will likely never conclusively lead to scientific consensus and, 2) this is beside the point, as all I need to do to refute you is to address the source of your argument which is your own opinion / experience. The fact that you, personally, do not see or believe in the benefits of technology with regards to human interaction does not negate that others have, in very tangible ways, seen their social life largely improve because of technology. Stephen Hawking – who also happens to be disabled - comes to mind. To return to the situation in the news article, the potential removal or modification of certain human interactions – such as helping someone with a door – is a small price to pay to give disabled people the option of opening the door themselves. Place yourself in their shoes: imagine if you had to wait around and ask people to help you open a door constantly. How many doors do you open in a day? Imagine if you had to ask someone for help in just 10% of those cases. That would get old, really fast. Human interaction is certainly important and worthy of efforts to make it more frequent and meaningful but this doesn’t mean that it’s the most important facet to consider in all or even most daily events / tasks. The opening of doors is a basic task that all should be able to do by themselves, along with being able to drink water, going to the washroom, crossing the road, etc.   2. Dependency of disabled citizens towards abled citizens for assistive technology:   Crippled folks have a barrier, opening doors on their own. That barrier exists whether or not you have an expensive solution or not. They still depend on others to install, maintain, design, etc that solution that they alone require.   Rephrased (correct me if I’m wrong), the crux of your argument is the following: because disabled people necessarily depend on abled persons during at least one step in the lifecycle of assistive technology (creation-installation-maintenance etc.), assistive technology ends up being itself a barrier. I.e., because a barrier is addressed with technology that cannot be fully deployed without the assistance of an abled bodied person, that technology is itself a barrier. Ergo, the only way to achieve a non-barrier would be for disabled people to entirely remove the barrier by themselves. The problem with this argument – which is a slippery slope fallacy – is that it is based on incorrect assumption on the aim of assistive technologies. Their goal is not to render disabled people completely independent from the abled population: it is to “level the play field”, so to speak, and remove / eliminate barriers that make an abled-body world more difficult to navigate or live in for disabled people.  In a perfect world, things are accessible and fine just the way they are for everyone, disabled or not, as barriers are non-existent. For example, the fact that smart phones can now tell you the time with sound makes knowing what time it is much easier for blind people. In the future, self-driving cars will make the abled world easier for disabled people to live in and navigate and will eliminate many barriers for them. Similarly, and specifically with regards to the example at hand, sliding doors with sensors in many big-chain stores work fine and make everything easier for everyone, disabled people included, so assistive / adaptive technology is not needed.  Assistive technologies do not create further barriers: if they were new barriers, they would continue to make things more difficult / impossible for disabled people, which is clearly not the case. You’ve also ignored that disabled people may in fact be (and certainly are, somewhere) involved in the lifecycle process of these technologies.   3) The availability of assistive technology destroying / replacing human values:    That technology seems like a good idea, but it replaced something that was invaluable. Compassion, empathy, caring, trust, respect, faith in humanity.   Though I’ve separated my comment into bullet-points, many of my previous arguments can be applied here. Technology seems like a good idea because it is a good idea. You speak of technology as being a force that replaces compassion, empathy, caring, trust, respect and faith in humanity. I would argue that the development and deployment of assistive technology embodies all of those values. Allowing disabled people to open a door on their own demonstrates that we have compassion and empathize with their situation; it demonstrates that we recognize that opening a door whilst in a wheelchair can be unnecessarily difficult and waste one’s time.  Those little moments of “hey, can you open that door for me?” or “here, let me get that for you” are not invaluable. Though they are nice moments, and I’m sure disabled people mostly appreciate the help when they occur, you forget that the person needing help isn’t always noticed by the able bodied people around them (due to tinted windows, people in line facing the other direction. ambient noises and music, etc.), and, more importantly, that not all disabilities are visible. Exchanging those potential moments of “politeness” for the knowledge that you will be able to open the door on yourself, not drawing attention to yourself,  etc. is a transaction disabled people are willing to make (as is demonstrated by the support disability associations have shown for the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA).  Taking your argument back through time also shows that it is incompatible with the very values you uphold. Before the invention of wheelchairs, many disabled people simply never left home and/or had a very poor social life. People with even more advanced forms of disability still had to stay at home / depend on others to push them around until electric wheelchairs were invented and became affordable. Automatic doors are just another assistive device in a long history of devices that have helped disabled people to life fuller lives. Furthermore, empathy, caring, trust and compassion go both ways: disabled people deserve the chance to be able to demonstrate these values through action by being able to volunteer, be there when a friend is sick at the hospital, go to their kids’ PTA meetings, etc.    4) Assistive technology creates new problems and fosters indifference:    Instead of people wanting to help others, they can meh there's a button them. Instead of cripples having the appreciation of those around them because they know they will help they can sit there and wait when the button doesn't work.   This sentence of yours can be rephrased as such: assistive technologies tend to render people indifferent towards the fate of disabled people whilst also simultaneously encouraging disabled people to become lazy. Aside from perhaps being based on purely anecdotal events, I don’t see how the two claims you made here can be supported.  The presence of an automatic door does not necessarily lead to the diminishment of people wanting to help others. Faced with broken / unresponsive technology, there’s no reason to state that disabled people tend to just sit around and wait.   5) Menial tasks and productivity:   And the reality is, opening a door occasionally is not what stops them from being productive.   Opening a door is not an occasional event. It happens multiple times a day for most, if not nearly all people. Having to wait around for others to open a door is a small event but those add up through time.  P.S.  Finally – and I’m ending here because I didn’t want you to take this personally right off the bat earlier – but please refrain from using the term crippled. It has a very negative connotation and is considered quite offensive.  Edit: formatting."
ottawa,3dsy9c,In_Odd_We_Trust,0,Tue Jul 21 03:00:01 2015 UTC,"The very fact that we’re having this (important and interesting) discussion at all is thanks to technology   Look at it this way, you couldn't tell if I was being an ass or being serious.  The medium is poor to say the least.  Not to mention the pace at which this is happening is ungodly slow and is two steps away from horse bound letter carrier.  Where this conversation would happen far quicker, and more concisely face to face, we are doing so here, with the obvious problem of bias towards those with differing opinions leading you to believe I am just being argumentative for the sake of being argumentative.  Having a door that opens at the touch of a button demands a similar problem.  They are dependant on that button to work because people will assume it will and won't look to help.  Conversely, the presence of the button diminishes the want to help.   assistive technology ends up being itself a barrier   It's more that it displaces the barrier another step down the road, not that it creates another.  Instead of maybe needing help with the door, now they need help with the door through the need for ensuring reliable service of the button and associated components.   I would argue that the development and deployment of assistive technology embodies all of those values.   The point I was making is that it's akin to slacktivism.  Instead of actually doing something, and actually advancing a cause, people sign a meaningless online petition and say see I did something.  Instead of going out of our ways to help folks that need it, and conversely appreciating that our neighbours are there to help, we collectively chip in a penny or two to install an unreliable piece of hardware so we don't have to.  Diminishing our role as able to help in the process.   assistive technologies tend to render people indifferent towards the fate of disabled people whilst also simultaneously encouraging disabled people to become lazy   It's not lazy at all, it's that rather than being appreciative of being helped by their neighbours, they instead just push a button.  The easiest way I can explain it is like a movie theatre.  500 people in a room together, all experiencing the same event, but they are doing so as 500 individuals, and not a community.  No one cares if their neighbouring seat is having a good time.  They may as well be there alone.  They are alone together.  The button removes that want to help your neighbour, that understanding that your neighbour will help you.  There is something sad about that.  Basically that button is the cheapest laziest way to help your neighbour without the ickyness of having to actually interact with them.   Opening a door is not an occasional event. It happens multiple times a day for most, if not nearly all people. Having to wait around for others to open a door is a small event but those add up through time.   Regardless, that's not what stops them from being productive.  There are many hours in a day and a few moments here and there do not stop someone from finding work.  Invariably there are a host of other reasons why.   P.S. Finally – and I’m ending here because I didn’t want you to take this personally right off the bat earlier – but please refrain from using the term crippled. It has a very negative connotation and is considered quite offensive.   Sorry but I don't play the politically correct game.  Crippled is the proper term to describe someone who can't perform a menial task on their own.  It might feel bad because it's a genuinely bad thing to happen.  But that's life.  One must learn to live with the lot we're given.  Evolution in language based on what makes us feel bad is an exercise in futility.  Whatever new term you come up with to describe the same thing will eventually be used as a slur and it too will be added to your list."

What they sent was pretty much exactly what I witnessed.

ottawa,3ds8gn,lngwstksgk,2,Sun Jul 19 19:56:42 2015 UTC,Absolutely would endorse this site. It aggregates posting from various sites and shows you a map of all the apartments in your range.
ottawa,3ds8gn,elementalist467,5,Sun Jul 19 01:08:26 2015 UTC,"Move to Ottawa. There's a neighborhood here called New Edinburgh, and it's lovely. It's a natural fit."
ottawa,3ds8gn,elementalist467,5,Sun Jul 19 13:03:51 2015 UTC,"Well, for my two cents, either choice, find out how to dress properly for the weather. Halifax and Ottawa both get hit by the lovely Canadian winter--Halifax will have by far more snow, but Ottawa will be generally colder and icier. It is like nothing you have experienced in Edinburgh. You want to know the basics of layering, to stay away from cotton, to wind-proof, and to have enough accessories to cover all extremities (so scarf, hat, earmuffs, gloves, or some adequate combination).   Apartments are fairly easy to come by. Search this sub for rental agencies to avoid, but off the top of my head, Paramount and CLV (though CLV seems to vary highly by building). Whether or not you consider the prices cheap is going to depend on what you're used to back home. It is possible to find a bachelor suite that you can pay for on minimum wage. Bus costs are atrocious, but the buses are fairly doable if you stay on what's called 'The Transitway.' Public transportation here lags far, far behind what you'd be used to in the UK. Megabus does now exist here, though I haven't tried it, but there is no Megatrain. For that matter, there's functionally no train at all, just the VIA line that goes across the country at regular intervals, is very slow (especially by European standards), and can be stopped for cattle on the tracks or because a freight train has priority (VIA rents from CPR, so...). Intercity busing is via Greyhound coaches, but it's going to be loooong. Don't make the mistake of thinking you can go to Edmonton for the weekend--I know it's cliché, but Canada's really big. The sheer scale of distances here is what I typically find new Canadians and visitors struggle with most, aside from the winters.  Jobs can be tight, but it depends also on how willing you are to work ""anything"" around. If nothing else, you can always clean houses or buildings. You definitely need French for many jobs here and it's highly recommended for even more. The west end of the city (i.e. Kanata, Barrhaven) have less requirement for French, but are also more expensive and further from downtown.   As for culture, I wouldn't really be thinking Halifax has a ""closer to Scotland"" feel, honestly. I haven't spent a whole lot of time in Nova Scotia, but there's very little in Canada, generally, that has that old-world feel. Nova Scotia does play up its Scottish heritage in form of Gaelic languages signage and education, bagpipes, tartans, etc., all the kitchsy stuff. If that's your thing, go for it. Much of it can also be found in Ottawa if you're looking--we even have the still-mostly-try-hard Canadian National Mòd here right downtown."

ottawa,3ds8gn,elementalist467,3,Sun Jul 19 18:53:46 2015 UTC,What is your education and areas of interest?  Ottawa is a combination of government and high tech employment.  Halifax is a banking and transport hub.  I don't really understand how you plan to just move here.  Typically foreign nationals require a visa to work and that requires an employer to sponsor the visa.  Are you participating in a work study programming?
ottawa,3ds8gn,elementalist467,2,Sun Jul 19 00:04:51 2015 UTC,I have a 2 year working visa and I plan to get to know the city before I delve into getting a job.

ottawa,3ds8gn,tavvyjay,2,Sun Jul 19 10:31:56 2015 UTC,What are your aspirations in coming to Canada?  Both Halifax and Ottawa will have retail opportunities.  French language skills are very relevant for customer facing service jobs in Ottawa.  This is less the case in Halifax.

ottawa,3ds8gn,thirstyross,3,Sun Jul 19 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"I definitely feel as though Ottawa is never a bad place to start in Canada. There is never any true hardship for finding employment (mind you, at minimum wage) if you've got people skills and can make some connections.. plus being from Scotland is likely an advantage because who doesn't want a Scot serving them drinks? As for general economy, the East Coast is probably cheaper to rent but the minimum wage is lower and you don't often hear of people heading out to the east to strike it rich in anything but forestry in New Brunswick or fishing in the other maritimes. I'm sure you could get by, but long-term, Ottawa has plenty of things to move into."

Their meat marinade is excellent and service is mediocre. I'm sure you know how hard it is to get someone to take your damn paper at kbbq. Koreana has terrible grills powered by little cans they attach. To make sure they don't waste too much fuel, they dump the meat on the grill for you so you can't just sit there and take your time. You can either overcook most of it or let it get cold by the time you want to eat it. Price was insanely expensive for kbbq - $17 per person (not including pop). The side selection was ok but portions were small (it becomes a problem when service sucks, as re-ordering small portions becomes more trouble than its worth)  Mu Goong Hwa is a disaster. The marinade is flavourless, the sides selection sucks, and the service is abysmal. It took about 30 minutes for the first order the only time I went. How hard is it to bring out RAW MEAT. The only good thing is they don't dump it on the grill for you, but they still use shitty portable table-top grills. Again, very expensive compared to Korean Grill House or the like."

As we came up to the parking lot for Westboro Beach, we see that it's pretty busy. There's cars parked everywhere, cars coming in, etc. We stop at the little bike stop sign as we are supposed to. But then the driver decides to stop too.  By being ""nice"" to us, you've now put the 2 drivers behind you who made a reasonable decision to enter the intersection in danger of being t-boned if someone inattentive comes along the parkway. You've made a situation that should have been clear (you have right of way) confusing.

I learned to drive in the GTA, and I've driven through Montreal a number of times, and I'd father rather drive in either of those cities than Ottawa. I know that sounds crazy, but I find Ottawa drivers are just so inconsistant. In addition to the lack of signals (which I find is far worse than Toronto, at least) you get the ultra aggressive people along with the people who are terrified to be on the road and driving 10 under for no reason then slam on their brakes because they think they saw something somewhere near the road. At least in Toronto and Montreal they are consistently aggressive, I know what to expect. Here, I never know.   That is just what I've personally experienced though. I've been across Canada and spent time driving in most major cities (excluding BC, and Regina) and Ottawa, for me, is by far my least favourite to drive in."

I think it actually bothers some of my friends when they drive with me. Thank you for assuming I drive unsafely though, I appreciate that (/s) -- although in all fairness, it is a pretty safe assumption around here.   As far as slamming on the brakes from tailgating, I don't care how annoyed you are that is still not safe on a busy road and the closest erratic braking comes to affecting me is when someone dodges in front of my to avoid rear-ending a group of cars erraticly stopping because someone decided to slam on their brakes -- tailgater or not.   It was a general observation that I find people erratic around here and I could have just as easily talked about turning from the wrong lane or anything like that."
ottawa,3dnth9,actualzombie,2,Sat Jul 18 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"Very interesting perspective.  I learned to drive in Ottawa, but have lived in Toronto, and drove to Montréal for work and friends.  I agree with your observations about Ottawa drivers; there is still a bit of a small town mentality to the rules of the road, but I can anticipate them.  Like not accelerating to highway speed on the on ramp before merging, or what I like to call the ""Ottawa turn"": turning wide so as to not end up in the closest lane.  Toronto I drivers I found more assertive, but I don't agree with your assessment of tailgating; I found much less space is left for merging cars in Toronto, and between cars in general.  I will agree that spacing between cars is more consistent, though it is certainly not a nice safe 2 seconds.  Montréal I find between Ottawa and Toronto in aggressiveness, but they drive quickly, decisively, and with purpose.  They are unforgiving with nervous drivers, and if you're not sure where a turn or exit is."

Overuse of the horn too -- especially cabbies -- who do something illegal then honk at the person they nearly run into like it is the innocent driver's fault. Edmonton is bad for merging below speed too, so I got somewhat used to that.

If you're on a bike you are subject to the same rules as a motorized vehicle so act accordingly. Unfortunately whether a driver is in the wrong or not when a cyclist is injured or killed they are assumed guilty until proven otherwise.    On a bit of a tangent I was driving down to Walkley via the 417 E. yesterday evening and lo and behold there was a scooter parked on the side of the highway.

The problem is that some cyclists, like some drivers, are irresponsible. They figure it's never going to happen to them. They take dangerous liberties [and I'm including anyone who uses public roadways including pedestrians who quite often do really stupid things] and they put themselves at risk. Even stupid irresponsible people do not deserve to be killed or maimed on the road.  The problem is cyclists are a little bit like pedestrians, if a motor vehicle and a bicycle or a pedestrian are involved in an accident the default is that the blame goes to the guy driving the car.  Sometimes that is accurate and sometimes it isn't. You can't blame a bus driver for hitting somebody who runs out in front of them because their life apparently depends on getting on that bus. Odds are good however until the investigation is completed the driver is the one who is dragged over the coals in the press.  It's really simple. If I make a mistake when I'm driving and I bump the curb I'm not going to die. I might blow a tire or scratch my rims but in the big scheme of life that's meaningless.  If a cyclist cuts off a car or rides against traffic or does something equally careless and stupid and illegal he or she is risking their lives. It's like riding a motorcycle, you have no real protection against a motor vehicle and cars cannot stop on a dime.  A very dear old friend of mine was killed three weeks ago on his motorcycle, he was the safest driver I've ever met, he was experienced, he was smart but none of that protected him when someone crossed the centerline on a clear day and killed him and one of his buddies. When you're vulnerable you have to always be aware of the dangers."

Also luckily there were rollbar thingies on it and it was an old bike so it didn't really do any damage that mattered.  It was a valuable lesson.  The worst part of the whole experience was being a girl who had dumped her bike and had to pick it up again with a bunch of male onlookers.

On the 4xx series highways in Ontario though, it is common for people to be driving 140+ km/h during light traffic periods. The cops don't usually seem to care much as long as everyone is going about the same speed and the flow is steady."

It's funny.  If people are in front of you, they are too slow, if behind, too fast.  Seems that everybody else, other than you,  is driving the wrong speed.   :)"
ottawa,3dnth9,ntappin,5,Fri Jul 17 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"All it means is that I enjoy driving and I respect myself, my life and safety and the safety of others around me by putting good rubber on my vehicles. Cheap tires are probably the very worst thing you can do for your car.     I decided to edit this for clarity. The reason I said sporty car and good tires is because should I be speeding on the highway, (something I avoid beyond 20 over in the right conditions because speeding tickets are too damn expensive and the roads around here are awful for the most part) I'm driving a vehicle that is designed and equipped to do so as safely as possible. Minivans and pick up trucks and sport-utility vehicles are not designed to safely exceed highway speeds. My other vehicle, one I'm currently selling, is a Chev Tracker that is plastered with ""high roll over risk"" stickers.  I drive it with the greatest respect for it's limitations because it doesn't take much to throw one of these off. If soccer mom and her minivan is doing 140 and has to make a quick maneuver she and the kids are going to be doing back flips into the ditch. If somebody driving a car that's low to the ground with performance tires has to make that same maneuver the odds are very good that they will continue along the road with no issues. It's all about knowing your vehicle and driving it according to both your abilities and the vehicles tolerances. The biggest mistake I have seen people driving larger vehicles, say a 4 x 4 Ford pick up truck, is they forget that they are not bulletproof. They forget that it doesn't matter how fast their reflexes are, the truck is not designed for high-speed maneuvers. Drive it on a smooth road in a straight line you can probably do 200 miles an hour with no issues.  Put a couple of potholes or swerve to miss a deer on that same road or it's game over."
ottawa,3dnth9,mdr-fqr87,3,Fri Jul 17 20:26:32 2015 UTC,Dumb statement.
ottawa,3dnth9,dougieman6,-8,Fri Jul 17 20:30:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry, clearly it's only you folks with racing stripes who can go over 100. Not my van that tops out at 260."
ottawa,3dnth9,MikeGeiger,6,Fri Jul 17 20:52:48 2015 UTC,"And your van that does 260, how well does it do when you have to swerve around an obstacle on the road? Does it stick to the road like Velcro on performance tires or does it roll over and kill you?    It's not about how fast you can go on a straight flat road with no obstacles.  Pretty well any car,  as long as it's not rattling apart, does fine under those conditions.  It's about how your vehicle responds when a deer jumps out in front of you or when someone who's moving furniture has a box fall off the top of their car and you have half a second to respond, or when someone who's texting and driving veers into your lane. You may have the fastest reflexes on the planet but if your vehicle can't keep up with those reflexes they're not worth very much.    Horse power and torque are only one part of the equation.  Handling when you're driving at high speeds is what makes the difference.  I should add that you're going to drive how you want to drive and as long as you don't endanger me in the process it's none of my business.  Please don't do when you have your children in the van."
ottawa,3dnth9,popcad,-9,Fri Jul 17 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"Of course I don't drive it at 260. But not all non-sports cars are junk, and not all vans are driven by soccer moms. And who gives a fuck if they are? The level of hatred for those not 25 on this site is off the charts.  And my van handles great swerving around idiots who don't have a fuck-clue how to drive safely, good tires or no."
ottawa,3dnth9,dougieman6,3,Fri Jul 17 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"I don't personally care how old you are,  I'm glad your van handles well and once you do have kids I hope you drive responsibly.

ottawa,3dolxn,NotQuiteSonic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:29:57 2015 UTC,I think it was probably Albert and Preston where that intersection would have been.
ottawa,3dolxn,hyperpandiculation,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:35:08 2015 UTC,"Preston was extended north to substitute for the stretch of Booth that is currently a giant pit. The resultant intersection has 4 different streets: Preston to the south, Wellington to the east, Vimy Place to the north, and the Sir John A. Macdonald (Ottawa River) Parkway to the west.  They do intersect once again, although considering how much traffic goes through this intersection, there ought to be a few good honks every hour, all day, every day."
ottawa,3dolxn,Kaylya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:56:39 2015 UTC,"I knew of the Preston extension, but I thought it was already parkway at that point. I thought it changed from Wellington to Parkway at the Portage Bridge or Booth or something, but the city describes Preston as being closed from Wellington to Albert for Bluesfest so I guess I'm wrong ;)  But if you look at the area, you'll see that that means there's 2 distinct, parallel-ish roads called Wellington (the other being in poor repair and mostly used for bus parking). This continues into a random patch of completely derelict road that would intersect with Albert if it wasn't cut off. Just another way that Wellington is messed up!"

They put themselves, and every aspect of their lives first.

ottawa,3dmoey,johnnydouglas,15,Fri Jul 17 15:51:50 2015 UTC,"Viewed in the best light, its a method of meeting women using manipulation techniques to find a man's best potential life mate.  Viewed in the worst light, it's a method of psychologically degrading women in order to have sex with them to satiate the man's ego.  From my observations it tends towards the later rather than the former.  I personally view it as really shady even if taken in the best possible light, as I don't believe that a healthy relationship can be based on manipulation rather than trust."

ottawa,3dmoey,as_hagi,4,Sat Jul 18 00:04:33 2015 UTC,I followed the Red Pill for awhile out of shock - almost like rubbernecking a car accident. Some talk at TRP is about relationships but the focus seems (imo) to be having sex with as many women as possible.   TRP engages in a lot of Straw Man arguments where the Straw Man is presented as a sexually mature woman who has no interest in the TRPer.
ottawa,3dmoey,OttabMike,17,Fri Jul 17 18:10:30 2015 UTC,Also they are obsessive about labelling other men as being either an alpha or a beta. It's pretty pathetic

ottawa,3dmoey,TheBandIsRedHeaven,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:59:55 2015 UTC,vids got taken down. Does anyone know how he looks like so that i will know if he is nearby..
ottawa,3dmoey,TheBandIsRedHeaven,-3,Fri Jul 17 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify something about the legality of this: You can't record someone and then publish their picture or video, and it's even worse if you use their likeness to promote something commercial (it's suggested elsewhere in this thread that he's looking to be a dating guru of some kind).   This is a bit of a tricky area, because it's not illegal per se (meaning he wouldn't go to jail) but the woman in the video can take him to court for damages. And she'd win, because you don't get to publish people's likenesses without their permission (certain exemptions exist for the press). If he's using them privately (i.e. not publishing them) then I'm not sure how much traction a lawsuit would have... but we're looking at his videos here, so obviously that's not a consideration.  By the way, releasing the video (on Youtube or your blog or Reddit or whatever) qualifies as ""publication.""  Thing is, the woman in question has to actually go through the process of making the complaint and all that entails (which is a pain). It can't be done on their behalf. So you couldn't just say ""Hey there's a guy videorecording women downtown"" and he ends up in jail. The complaint has to come from the women unless he's doing something more (like interfering with customer access to a storefront by blocking their way). Also, there's a chance some of these women signed a waiver (we don't know if they did or didn't). Obviously, if they did, they can't get legal traction against him.  He could really screw up if he started making any sort of sexual overtures (even mild) towards women in a place where children might be exposed. At that point he could be charged or fined and possibly banned from certain public areas (say a park or out front of a day care).   Maybe a bunch of bad things will happen to him legally. Maybe not. But he's definitely playing with fire. There are a lot of people who would not like to be used a promotional media for his hypno-creep product or whatever, and he's eroding all their good will by being a twit.   So yeah. Saying ""They have no recourse if it's public"" isn't exactly true. There's a lot of recourse that can be taken against what he's doing... but someone has to actually go to the trouble."
ottawa,3dmoey,Sc00termcgee,2,Fri Jul 17 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"Since some of his videos have the faces censored out, it is plausible that some level of consent to use the footage was given in cases. In the case of the censored videos, obviously he's trying to avoid the subjects knowing that he used footage of them.  So with exposure of what he is doing, its likely that someone will remember a run in with him and possibly take the time to do something about it."
ottawa,3dmoey,Dylaniskillin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"You know, if I were this guy I would be somewhat concerned about legal action... but he's playing a much more dangerous game than that. I'm not advocating violence at all, but this is the kind of thing where someone sees a video of him sleazing up a girlfriend/sister/daughter/whatever, gets a few of his pals, looks up his address, goes to his house, and beats him until he has to eat through a straw.  I don't want that to happen to anyone. But I think every time he posts one of these videos he's one step closer to spending a month in a hospital listening to doctors discuss how they can rebuild his face."

You absolutely, positively can't do that. It's dangerous. All it takes is one guy to decide he's judge and jury and he shows up on the guy's doorstep one day. That's bad news, man.  Anyhow, it's edited out... so that's all fine and well. But I have to say: I question your motivation for directing people to know his home address and phone number. What good can come of that? What is it you want people to do with that information?"
ottawa,3dmoey,Gatineau,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:05:48 2015 UTC,"Call it reactionary I guess. I understand that it creates a potentially dangerous situation and I'm happy I removed it in the end. (To be honest, when I first copy/pasted the registrant info dump I didn't realize the home address was on there too).  As for my motivation, it's pretty simple. My friend was walking downtown yesterday, and this guy stopped her to talk, very deliberately leering at her up and down (so that the camera could get a good look at her figure) and continued his shtick until she was creeped out enough to walk away.   So now my friend has to feel violated for however long that memory lasts, and this guy gets a video of himself objectifying her for the entire world to see. I don't see that as fair. So yeah, if he receives a few angry phone calls from people savvy enough to /whois his web domain, I think that's the very least I can hope for in terms of retribution.   Luckily, since this guy seems keen on public appearances, I think Ottawa owes him a piece of their mind wherever he shows up next."

Or, if it's a Saturday, try a Redblacks game. They're affordable and even if you're not into CFL it's a good atmosphere in the sunshine. Plus, lots of good bars nearby for a drink.  Evening Option: Murray Street Kitchen for dinner. A top-notch vibe without being pretentious. Specializing in meat and meat dishes. Follow it up with a visit to either Brothers Bistro (for craft beer) or Hooch (for the harder stuff).  Ottawa isn't loaded with ""activity""-type stuff, but if that's what you're looking for others have suggested lazer tag, paintball and whatnot and that's all there."

For a reasonable price you get a couple hours of basic medieval sword lessons and get to battle your friends with foam swords. Really fun stuff and an alternative to the traditional paintball or laser tag.

I haven't been to the new one yet, but since it's part of a larger development, I'd imagine there are a lot of requirements for supports and what not that purpose built locations wouldn't have to deal with.   It could also be that the space was planned before Sobeys got involves, so they are being shoehorned into a space not ideal for them."
ottawa,3dn6he,llama4ever,3,Fri Jul 17 19:49:16 2015 UTC,this is probably the right answer..there is a format for grocery stores if they lay them out themselves but sometimes you work with what youre given.

ottawa,3dp8mg,sitting-duck,4,Sat Jul 18 11:44:58 2015 UTC,Got nipped at BP by someone's pitbull one day while I was trying to retrieve my pup from an overactive play with another dog. The pitbull ran up to me and nipped my hand. I took one look at that dog to gauge a possible attack and was ready to do what I had to do.  The owner came sauntering over and looking all hurt that I may have had intentions of beating down her pitbull as it JUST bit at my hand.  I shook my head and said she should have a muzzle on her dog. She was so hurt and offended. WTF. Stupid dog owners.  That lady should report the incident to Bylaw and the Police and people should keep an eye out for this dog and report it on sight. Edit - spelling.

ottawa,3dp8mg,canadianbeech,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"While I empathize and do not like that you were attacked by a dog of any breed, I do not agree with the idea that you can ""never trust a pitty"". It has been said before but it is not the dog it is the owner. I grew up with 2 pit bulls and trusted them with my life. I wrestled them, ran with them, interacted with them even when they were eating, swam with them, slept with them... They never snapped, never bit or attacked me. If they were fighting with each other I could even step in and pull them apart and not be attacked even if they were in the middle of a fight. I have been attacked numerous times by spoiled little Pomeranians and shitzus however which never are talked about in the same way Pittys are. Dogs are pack animals and without a strong leader they will not know how to function in a human based society. Do you really think an animal knows what is socially acceptable if it has never been taught? It is not a pitbull that has decided to be a member of a human society, it is the owner that has decided that for them.

ottawa,3dostz,SprayingVomit,6,Sat Jul 18 00:52:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, $25/day x 30 days is an extremely small amount for private dog sitting.  I was recently looking for someone and was quoted $25 PER HOUR to look after my dog by most people who responded!  I'm sorry I can't be of help, I just wanted to tell you of my experience researching this very topic over the past few weeks."
ottawa,3dostz,fissionvsfusion,2,Sat Jul 18 02:08:38 2015 UTC,$25 an hour seems overly ridiculous. I can't imagine anyone charging that much.
ottawa,3dostz,TechSquirrel,3,Sat Jul 18 03:57:56 2015 UTC,I can see that for a service that's coming by in the middle of the day to take your dog for a walk while you're out. Obviously not for days at a time.
ottawa,3dostz,Kaylya,2,Sat Jul 18 11:22:03 2015 UTC,$25 dollar a day is about $1/hr. Peanuts if you ask me.
ottawa,3dostz,jazzybest,0,Sat Jul 18 05:42:01 2015 UTC,"$25/day is super reasonable, but considering dog sitting at an hourly rate isn't the best way to break it down.  It's not babysitting or working a job, where you're required to be focused and attentive on something 100% of the time.  If you can hang out with a dog and go about your daily in-home leisure activities (reading, watching TV, playing games, crafting, etc.) you don't necessarily need to be earning much to make it worthwhile.  Plus, hanging out with a dog can be a nice bonus!"

There isn't a place where cheap dog care and good dog care overlap. Dog care, at least non-terrible dog care, takes a good bit of time.  PM me if you're interested in in-home care at a decent wage. I might not be able to do it at a kennel rate as quoted below, but it would be a nice environment with a lot of attention."

My budget is $300, hopefully that is something you can work with. Thanks again for the message, cheers!"
ottawa,3dostz,her_nibs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"That is -- I mean no offence -- first, more than ""a month,"" and, also, not a rate you are going to be able to get quality care for. I wish I could, but I'm not even sure why you replied; like I said, ""I might not be able to do it at a kennel rate as quoted below,"" and $300 for a month and a half is quite a bit less...  I don't know if you don't like your dog or don't like people or are just dirt poor and hoping for a miracle, but, cripes. If I farmed the entirety of the non-fun work out to my kid, it would work out to an hourly wage that I would not be cool with paying even a young, supervised child.  I can't see this ending any other way than a terrible kennel or a teenager with abusive or neglectful parents and your taking advantage of a bad situation in either case. You really need to do the math on how many hours it takes to care for a dog, including the extra housecleaning etc, and the math on what you're offering."
ottawa,3dostz,jazzybest,2,Tue Jul 21 03:47:00 2015 UTC,I have used Petsmart for shorter time frame and had  no issues. its about $25/day minimum. That rate includes a couple of walks and 24 hour monitoring and if you want extra stuff you have to pay more. Overall I found you get what you pay for terms of quality of care.   edit: I have tried private  care  ( i.e. non franchise type) and to my surprised Petsmart was much better. the one i used last was Petsmart on Merivale.
ottawa,3dostz,canadianbeech,2,Sat Jul 18 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"25 dollars a day is reasonable if you think about it. That's at least 90 washroom breaks, likely 60 feedings, playtime and socialization. To ask someone privately means they can't go anywhere for the whole time you are. You pay for the service.   Too bad your current sitter can't watch him, but $25 isn't that much."

Some kids need counseling, sure.  To deny that you are responsible enough, as an adult, for their upbringing, such that at the young age of 16 you eject them from your house, is sad.  Likely it is a decision made from a limited set of resources, in a lower income family, because the resources to help such individuals who are expressing themselves in such a manner is expensive.

Depending on the building/complex you end up in though, I wouldn't be so worried about my safety going out alone or at night. My entire building is just families, couples or students my age, possibly lower income, but no gang-bangers far as I've seen, nothing where I'm worried about my security being in and around the building. My GF has more problems with wolfcalls downtown when she waits for the bus than walking from the bus stop where we are.

ottawa,3dk0gq,indibee,2,Fri Jul 17 03:00:59 2015 UTC,I've gone to and from the airport before. It was very late when we left from the airport and we just texted the driver what number we were at for pickup and what we were wearing. Super quick and efficient.
ottawa,3dk0gq,Michel_K,2,Fri Jul 17 16:20:07 2015 UTC,Tread carefully. I know a driver who was told off by a commissionaire for picking up at the airport. She threatened to report him to OPS or be charged with trespassing if he came back to pick up.
ottawa,3dk0gq,mtanner613,2,Fri Jul 17 01:24:30 2015 UTC,"Just to throw in my 2 cents, I've never had a problem FROM the airport either. Typically, it looks like there's a half a dozen just circling around arrivals. In fact, I had requested an Uber then noticed another driver parked and waiting right in front of me. No problems here."
ottawa,3dk0gq,OttawaNerd,0,Fri Jul 17 11:51:46 2015 UTC,Which has what to do with rides TO the airport?
ottawa,3dk0gq,Michel_K,0,Fri Jul 17 02:51:05 2015 UTC,TO nothing. But you might have difficulty FROM

ottawa,3dk0gq,yolo_swagovic2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:01:40 2015 UTC,To the airport I think is fine because you cant prove its Uber. but from the airport no. They can get a fine if they pick up from the airport from what Ive learned.
ottawa,3dk0gq,y3knik,2,Fri Jul 17 02:44:33 2015 UTC,I have been picked up from the airport before as well. It seems like a couple of them park close to the airport and wait for people who have arrived to call for an Uber.

I'm absolutely not surprised with the lack of foresight on behalf of the Crown in issuing an arrest warrant and the detective/police force in enforcing it. I'll bet dollars to donuts that as long as one of these girls shows up to court or writes a victim impact statement with a big 'boo-hoo' story the judge will throw the book at him. Maybe not jail time but enough to fuck his life over for the foreseeable future.   The criminal harassment charge is rooted in the alleged victim’s perception of the offending conduct... The statute says if that conduct caused the alleged victims “reasonably, in all the circumstances, to fear for their safety”, that’s good enough.   Oh and by reasonably they mean you could literally say ""Karma's a bitch"" or ""what goes around comes around"" and all the ""victim"" has to do is pretend to be scared and they'll claim it's a veiled death threat. The only crime this man is guilty of is having a pair of nuts between his legs. Canadian law is such an unbelievable farce. It seems like every day I lose more and more respect for this country."

As convenient and fast as everything is now, damn, sometimes I really miss it."
ottawa,3di5tx,shanely,3,Thu Jul 16 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"When I was 7 or 8, my parents rented a videodisc player, and some movies (Superman was one) from a Radio Shack.  I thought it was the coolest thing ever.  Then when I was 11 or so, my grandmother bought our family a (VHS) VCR.  One day, my father brought home a movie he had rented.  That movie's title?  Revenge of the Nerds.  Our family laughed as we ate supper sitting on the couch, and later that night when they all went to bed, I re-watched, re-wound, paused and played the nudity scenes, and... you know...  We've got bush!. (hair pie, huh, huh, huh, huh)"

Basically, you could get five movies, for five days, for five dollars (and onward).  So if there was one movie I'd want to see, I'd grab it and four others because what the hell. Some I enjoyed, others not, but it was always fun just to pick up something I've never heard.  Now, I spend what feels like hours trying to pick what movie to watch on Netflix."

When I was a kid, I had a 24/7 video store not far from my place and they used to have a deal that from 12am to 6am, it was 2 for 1 and movies/video games back then were like $2-$3 a rental. So during the summer i would stay up late and my dad would take me to rent movies and we would always get the oversized popcorn bags they made. There was just something about going to get a movie and finding new movies i'd never even really thought to watch but looked cool based on the box art or description. Now i just stream everything....and there's no oversized popcorn :("

She pulled up the fine and pictures and behold my car was within 3 Meters of the fire hydrant (my bumper was in the 3M zone).

I think you are pleading guilty with cause or something. The last ticket I got a half off deal because I went past the time allowed, admitted it was my stupid mistake and offered to pay. Still took up part of my day going into the court, but it wasn't that long, and saved me $40 I think. But you need to be prepared to admit you were in the wrong, which it sounds like you were."

Once you have a ""live"" internet connection, your ""traffic"" is routed to your ISP and on to the internet (one or two extra hops, minimal effect on speeds).

In the past 5 years, I've had maybe 2 service calls for line problems (low SNR for one, the other was no communication to modem due to failure of something at the pole) but since I own a Motorola SB modem, I can check the connection info myself (http://192.168.100.1) to troubleshoot connection from ISP to the modem.  Prior to being on cable internet, I used DSL and at least once every year I'd have a modem sync problem come up.  Cable is more reliable, but adversely affected by the number of subscribers on your node.

The determination Christine has shown is inspiring.  With all respect and the best of intentions, I do have concerns to the safety and reliability of aided driving systems that are this involved.  I know little about the technology involved or how redundancy may be built into these systems but initially I felt very uneasy about this idea.  Would some of these systems not limit the driver's ability to respond in a time of crisis or perhaps impede the safe use of the vehicle?    I am curious what other fellow drivers or citizens think about this initiative."
ottawa,3dg4mf,BukkitBoss,9,Thu Jul 16 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"My mother is an incomplete quadriplegic and we looked into something similar for her.  Chances are the gas/brake control is just a lever system (attached to a sleeve in her case) which when pressed in one direction applies the gas, and when pressed in the other applies the brake. It's fully mechanical, so there's little concern over any failures.  For steering she's using a Brodie Knob, which used to be (and maybe still is) popular with truckers and bus drivers. Also unlikely to fail, within any normal circumstance.  Worst case scenario her headset fails and she is unable to signal until she pulls off the road. Considering the number of people who fail to signal their turns, I'd say this is far from a terrible worst case scenario.  At the end of the day she's probably no more of a threat to anyone on the road than your average driver."

The OMB claim appears to be a dispute over the nature of the development itself; instead of a mixed commercial/residential space, the OMB challenges are focused on retaining the central lands for public use.

ottawa,3dej1j,InTURRISting,2,Thu Jul 16 10:34:46 2015 UTC,"When there are trains going through an area it should never be a surprise that you can hear them for miles. I grew up in a small town with the rail line running through it and you could be 10 miles away and still hear them if conditions were right.  I also lived in a house in Thornhill that backed on train tracks and after the first week I didn't hear them anymore. The brain can adapt to a lot of things.  Even living where I do now, in Orleans, I still occasionally hear train whistles when the wind is blowing in the right direction.  Perhaps I'm expecting too much of people but if you do buy in an area where there are train tracks there's going to be some level of noise and the closer you get the more likely that there's going to be of vibration as well. I have a hard time feeling sympathy for people who make a purchase of that magnitude without doing their homework first. When going into Barhaven it's pretty hard to miss that train tracks run right through it."
ottawa,3dej1j,johnnydouglas,-1,Thu Jul 16 10:48:10 2015 UTC,i lived in crag henry with one 20m from my house.  i lived in sudbury next to a traincroasing by an inco mine.  the whistle duration and loudness has become obnoxious in barrhaven only in the last few months.    it is also a slow moving passenger train.  seriously you have no business criticizing because ita clear no on actually knowa what is annoying barrhaven residents all of a sudden.
ottawa,3dej1j,joshysea,2,Thu Jul 16 10:53:03 2015 UTC,"If the whistle is blowing longer and louder might it possibly be because Barhaven residents have been complaining about safety, about how fast the trains go through etc. If the passenger train has to pass through more slowly, which I believe it does now, the whistle duration is logically going to be longer.    There is zero doubt in my mind that it is as annoying as hell, possibly even more so for people with young children or people who are light sleepers or shift workers. Unfortunately if via rail stops using the whistle and there's an accident nobody in Barrhaven is going to say ""oh it's our fault because we didn't want to hear the whistle anymore"", we are going to hear residents blaming via rail and everyone except other than the group of people who got tired of listening to the train whistle.    When I moved Ottawa I took my time and I did my research.  I didn't want 24 hour aircraft flying over my house so I didn't buy in Hunt club.  I didn't buy in a new development backing onto a lovely meadow or woodland because I knew damn well the odds were good that within 10 or 15 years Minto would be slapping up townhomes right next to my backyard.  When you buy a house you need to do your research. It is not unreasonable to assume that if you're within ten miles of a busy train track that there is going to be noise.  It's as simple as that.  If you're thinking of buying in a specific neighbourhood the smart thing to do before you make your decision is to go back without the realtor and talk to the neighbors. See what they have to say about the area. Realtors will under estimate disruptions and location issues to close a sale, it's likely that if you speak to your potential neighbours they will not lie to you.  You can't touch a half decent single-family home in this area for under $300,000 and that somebody would make a purchase of that magnitude without due diligence completely boggles my mind."
ottawa,3dej1j,clawman9090,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:17 2015 UTC,"I'm quite happy where I am.  I did my research.    but you have to understand the area they are referring to is mature, and has been subject to planning changes after the fact which are so major because the city neglected the work for 20 years.  It is an old neighborhood in this particular area.   A kid was killed here like 20 years ago.   Previous safety issues had to do with broken sensors which seems to have subsided (crossings have been fairly reliable over the past winter and summer unlike last year, via no longer posts special monitors).   If the whistle is blowing longer and louder might it possibly be because Barhaven residents have been complaining about safety, about how fast the trains go through etc. If the passenger train has to pass through more slowly, which I believe it does now, the whistle duration is logically going to be longer.   Absolutely, it is overkill.  It is overkill because of construction in the area, and a temporary crossing.   To silence it I agree is unsafe, there has to be a middle ground, but leave it to Ottawans to find the most extreme sides of every issue.  What I do not understand is the amount of vitriol and contempt people have for those who are affected enough by this to complain about it.    I'm willing to bet they didn't even want it silenced completely if it will be at all!"
ottawa,3dej1j,NegScenePts,2,Thu Jul 16 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"People absolutely love to complain. And they tend to complain without looking at the big picture.  I feel the same way about the people who are grumbling about the temporary bus route along Scott Street. Yes it is annoying, yes it's going to be noisier, dustier, more traffic. However it's short-term pain for long-term gain.  They're going to be close to light rail which is a huge advantage, it's probably going to raise their property values down the road but nobody seems to be able to look past next week.  I suspect the vitriol being shown in this thread is in part because of many of the reasons you have mentioned.  While it's possible to sympathize with people to point it's not as if it's financially feasible to pick up either their houses or the rail lines and move them. Taxpayers could foot for the bill for a tunnel but like many other infrastructure projects it's going to be paid for primarily for by people who aren't going to benefit from it. That's the nature of the beast, people in rural Ottawa live with this all the time because their tax rates certainly don't get them anywhere near as much per dollar as tax rates of people who live in the city.    Sure it sucks because as you said there are some older homes there - although I imagine the trains were there before they were - people are concerned about safety, it sucks to get stuck behind a train when you're in a rush, a whole bevy of inconveniences.  It goes with living in an urban area and enjoying all the benefits that come with it. While you did your research (and good on you for doing it), lots of people didn't. Those would probably be the same people who are making the most noise about the trains.  Many of them are probably the same people who complain their child doesn't get a bus to school because they're within whatever the kilometer limit is, or the people who grumble that they're not on an express bus route - or that they are on an express bus route and it's noisy. It's life in the big city.  My biggest annoyance is this. I live on an old street in an established neighborhood. There are maybe a dozen houses in the section I live on. The volume of traffic is enormous and people speed all the time - 99% of them are not residents of this area, I simply happened to choose a house on a street that is a convenient shortcut from one side of Orleans to the other.  I also have the advantage of being 10 seconds from an express bus route, walking distance from two grocery stores etc. While I might like to see the police doing traffic a bit more often to slow down traffic I certainly am not going to go screaming to the city to put in speed bumps or block the street off like so many in this area are because I'm the one who chose to live here."

Every hour you'd hear the LONG blast as the trains came to the various crossings and at ours it wasn't just the loud horn, the entire house shook for the 5 minutes or so it took for those trains to go by.  (They didn't do the horn at night, only daylight hours.)  It really wasn't bad.  Just something you got used to.  The 6am train I slept through, the 7am one was my alarm clock and after the 8am one my school bus would cross the tracks and pick me up.  None of us were missing out on sleep.  The only real annoyance was that since  the trains were so long and slowing to enter town  you could get stuck waiting for the crossing to clear for what seemed like ages.   We moved from there to a place that would feel the blasting from a quarry a few miles away three times a day.   That was just barely a shake of the house though, barely felt it and never heard it. Visitors often commented they felt an earthquake.   ""Nope, it's just 1pm."""

They spend well over a year trying to get the permanent crossings to work and they continued to fail, repeatedly.

However, some of the newer neighbourhoods they're developing (houses south of Chapel Hill South for example) are extremely car-dependent for pretty much everything. I was pretty inactive when I lived out there (just driving around everwhere would sap my energy...lack of compelling paths/biking/pedestrian infra curtailed jogs/bike rides).  Having moved from a car-dependent suburb to one that isn't has been hugely positive to my health:   I actually have a nice bike route to work...this was never an option before. Lots of stores, Rideau Centre, restaurants, and now a Cinema (Lansdowne) are even more easily accessible by bike/foot than car for me (any time savings with driving is offset by parking/traffic challenges). Kids have nice parks and schools that are actually bikeable/walkable and I have the option to go to soccer and other sports without a car. Although transit is OK in my current neighbourhood, it was downright awful in the old suburb...essentially tripling/quadrupling commute times vs. driving. Although it isn't much, you're still more active taking the bus than sitting in the car the whole time."

There are other walkable areas besides the Glebe that are more affordable, though most families avoid them because of the perception of being unsafe. Now these areas do have more crime than a lot of suburbs but the amount of driving done when living in the suburbus automatically increases risk of being injured in a car accident on top of the adverse health effects mentioned in the article.   Basically all Ottawa neighbourhoods bulit after WWII, were built almost entirely for car travel at the expense of everything else. Also, home buyers all want a quiet street with no through traffic and no shops which leads to large collector roads that everyone has to use and drive to in order to get out of the neighbourhood or do some local shopping.

ottawa,3dij4o,elwillow,0,Thu Jul 16 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"Virgin is the absolute worst.  For starters, reception is terrible and they send you a bill on a certain date but it ""automatically"" updates on your account days before and if you don't pay it (without seeing your bill) then they disconnect your phone.   Oh - and most companies when they disconnect your phone, you can still contact the company through 611 or dialing out. However with Virgin, your phone goes to no service and you will need to use another phone. It's extremely frustrating. Worst company I've been with overall!"
ottawa,3dij4o,elwillow,2,Thu Jul 16 18:39:14 2015 UTC,"Do you have a bad history with paying your bill?  The only time I know virgin shuts off your phone is when you reach the $200 credit limit. I think at around $150+ they limit your phone so you cant make outgoing calls then after you reach $200 thats when they shut off service. Are your bills really that high?   If you look at your bill online theres a ""Pay by: [X date]"" so its not like you're not aware when you should pay your bill and if you dont pay by then you're charged a late fee. Pretty standard.  They dont automatically shut off your phone. I've been with virgin for years and sometimes let my bill sit a month without paying and eventually do pay it off. My service isnt' affected in any way.   As for reception, some areas in Ottawa are a bit shotty but when I switch to 3g rather than LTE I get better service surprisingly lol.  I dont use my phone much anyway but I can see how this is annoying for people who use their phones a lot.  I do agree that when they shut off your phone its annoying but all you have to do is call them beforehand and let them know your situation and it wont come to that. I've been unemployed on and off the last two years and they were understanding about it.   They would call me ahead of time to let me know they're going to disconnect my service until I pay X amount.  And because I pay through the bank it gives me some time however if you tell him ""Yeah I'll be able to make a payment of X amount on X date"" and they'll take note of it on your account so the next time you call back whoever answers will see it. If you dont make the payment they'll call you again and if you dont hold up your end of the deal then they tried to help.   Its all about communication, like with anything.  But yeah I'm a very happy customer with Virgin and have been the last 6 years."
ottawa,3dij4o,farinefiveroses,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"Huh? I'm confused, I'm with Virgin too. I get a notification of my bill being ready like 2 weeks before I need to pay it. (e.g. for this months bill I received an email on July 9th, and a text on the 12th, and I need to pay by the 22nd).   Not to mention the ""pay by"" date is the same for me every month so I already know when I have to pay it by anyway.  As for reception, it'll be hit or miss with any carrier. From what I understand, Rogers is worse than Bell (Virgin) in the Ottawa area. Wind, who knows, some people say it's amazing, many say it's horrible (not to mention slower data speeds). But it all depends where you are and where you go, as well as your phone I'm sure plays a part.  I hope you're not getting rid of the amazing 6 gig plan that was available to ""Thunder Bay"" residents. I have the same and I'm never letting go.

ottawa,3dexnf,boggletrax,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:05:26 2015 UTC,"The Prince of Wales is wonderful during the summer ! Here are some suggestions for you :  1) go for a walk or run alone the Rideau canal- it is so peaceful and relaxing. There are tons of cyclist and runners on the weekend as well. And depends on how far you want to go- the cannel actually can connects all the way to downtown.   2) Go for a hike in the Hog's back park- its got a neat little trail and there is a waterfall there too. Wonderful place to have a nice little picnic or coffee with friends.   3) Go to Mooney's Bay Beach and you can do quite a few things there, it's got beach volleyball, a tennis court, BBQ stations and now there is even a beach bar. The food options is limited at the bar but the view is great for people watching. It is very popular in the summer time :)   4) You can rent a Kayak from the Ottawa Rideau Club or take paddle boarding lessons if you are feeling more adventurous. You can also watch some teams do their dragon boat practise there as well. There is also a pirates ship there available for rent but I think it's most for child's party?   5) Now in terms of food : The Prince of Wales of area has some great hidden gems: Thai coconut is one of the more authentic Asian restaurants around Ottawa in my humble opinion and their buffet is pretty decent too! The Asia Garden has the best Chinese take-out and it's pretty affordable. if you are looking for some more mainstream- there is the Wild Wings Sports Bar where you can grab a drink with friends and enjoy watching sports on many of their TVs. If you are in the mood for a sweet treat: there is a baskin Robins, Timmy's and MacDonald's within walking distance.  Oh and I almost forgot to mention- the little "" Farmer's Pick"" Grocery store has fresh bread that are baked daily, a various selection of cheese and beautiful produces. They have some of the best looking fruits I ever laid eyes on..a bit of pricy but totally worth the splurge.   I think someone also mentioned about the Greek Festival too- it’s happening on August 13-23 this year and I would suggest you check it out if you are in that area. There is always Zorba dancers, delicious Greek food and the admission is free!   Hope this list was helpful- sorry it's a bit on the long side! I am going to be moving away from this area soon so I am feeling a bit sentimental."

But seriously the parks are nice to walk around, bring a bag of charcoal and a picnic to Vincent Massey and use one of the public bbqs. Easy canal access is great, Farmer's Pick is a nice grocery store. Asia Garden's general tso chicken is food-crack. There's a Dirienzo's nearby for tasty italian sanguiches (although the ones at the deli counter at Farmer's Pick are just as good). That's about where my ""good"" list ends though.  Cons: I wouldn't swim in Mooney's bay thanks to the agricultural runoff up-river. Only pub within walking distance is a Wild Wing which is great if you like Molson products, overpriced wings and tacky faux wild-west decor. Only coffee shop within walking distance is a Timmies. Transit access is weak. Folkfest is no longer going to be at Hog's Back, and you missed Dragonboat Fest which had some amazing acts for free."

If you are interested in featuring new people, use the power of the internet to find them, or go to shows and the local art schools and classes to find people. There is a massive gap within the Ottawa Arts community, which means that a small group of artists are getting the large share of attention and therefore the media and the general public don't know, nor care to explore the quiet corners.

Your frustrations are part of what inspired me to start the blog in the first place - and I'm constantly seeking out artists (through the artlist, shows, fb groups, taking names down whenever I see work I like, reaching out to artists' friends...).   Scroll through the blog a bit more and you'll see there are a bunch of yet-uncelebrated but very talented people featured.  I do know of the handful always in the spotlight but it's usually well deserved, and if you reach out to them (say hi at shows, be genuinely supportive via social media) they're really a supportive group.

ottawa,3de5ar,drunkenrobot,3,Wed Jul 15 19:48:14 2015 UTC,"the idea is that you get the customer in the door. by OMVIC standards you (a dealer) are not allowed to sell a car and complete paperwork online.  main reason is that its flaky as hell and added work for sales managers who run the numbers. also, if there's a trade involved there's no way you can just give a value on their vehicle over the web.  a salesperon and manager can go through so much work to try and make something happen and the customer could just block your emails. a salesperson will normally say something like ""that sounds pretty reasonable and should be more than possible if everything checks out, when can you come in?""  its at that point you can start building a relationship or applying sales pressure/what-have-you."
ottawa,3de5ar,bonersnow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"I've used this tactic a couple of times (once via FAX, I'm old, once via email). It worked really well. The dealers that didn't bother responding were immediately scratched off my list, the ones that did gave me different prices, so I went to the cheaper one and did the rest in person. Saved a lot of haggling or ""we don't haggle"" lies and avoiding dealers that don't care if they get my business or not."
ottawa,3de5ar,badgerb,2,Wed Jul 15 20:21:52 2015 UTC,"usually if this price difference happens (obviously i have very little context) its because:   they were quoting you on the closest thing they had in stock, not what you wanted. thus the price was different some included their fees and others did not they were stupid/new or both   let me also say im not saying it doesnt happen - as i mentioned, it happens 8/10 times. but as the internet becomes easier to navigtate and information is more and more accessible. dealerships are becoming more wise to these shenanigans.  when i started selling cars many of my clients would email me and we'd get into a negotiation battle only to find 20 minutes he had blocked my email and bought down the street.  we all at one point learned that you dont have a deal until you get in the door.  ""don't say no, until you see the dough"" is a common phrase until someone is in front of you saying ""yes, i will buy that car RIGHT NOW if you can get me $2000 off the price"" than you just keep telling them, ""well that sounds tough, but if its going to happen - its going to be today! when can you come in?"""

I dealt with Jesse (IIRC) and his manager Gianni at Kanata Mazda. I believe they're willing to give more extended test drives, if you appear unsure.  You will not want to get in another Civic after testing the 3, if you like driving even a bit. This is after some years with a 2012 Civic. My choices were between a Ford Focus, 3, and VW Golf and ended up with the Golf. All three were good. The 3 wins on price every time, but I felt the Focus and Golf were better rides."

I know you likely will buy new anyways, but it's what I would have done if I could do it all over again.  My 2 cents."
ottawa,3de5ar,1LFrenzy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:02:36 2015 UTC,There are a good cases to buy NEW like:   if you don't have CASH to buy used car -> 0% finasing may be a better option (you will not get 0% for a used car) if NEW car comes with FREE Maintenance If you want specific options/color/model etc...  ...
ottawa,3de5ar,Treasonist,2,Thu Jul 16 12:52:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure those are completely valid.   If you don't have enough money to buy a used car you probably shouldn't be buying yourself a more expensive new one.  You won't get 0% but you'd still end up paying much more every month.   If you get a reliable used car from a reputable dealer, maintenance should not be much of an issue at all.   If having a particular color of car is important enough to you to spend an extra few thousand and buy new, then I guess we just have different priorities.   Again, I'd  be highly surprised that OP actually considered my advice, but to me, the mindset above is why so many people live paycheck to paycheck and can't manage to save any money.   Locking yourself into a bad investment by buying new is not a wise  financial decision, imo."

ottawa,3de5ar,drunkenrobot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"My sister purchased a Mazda3 from Kanata Mazda this time last year.  She was pretty happy with the process and definitely happy with the car.  She can be pretty timid about bartering and confronting sales people, but I think she ended up with a good deal.  We bring both my Civic and my wife's Civic to Kanata Honda for maintenance.  Neither vehicle was purchased there.  The parts staff are good and get anything I need quickly, but the tech drones in the shop have messed up two jobs on us.  Thankfully, the car was under warranty at the time and they fixed their stupidity - but only after a face-to-face confrontation.    You're doing the right thing by starting to look now, before you ""need"" a new car.  This gives you the ability to walk away from any deal without worrying about needing a set of wheels.  Also, when you do buy, refuse to pay for any ""additional dealer fees"" they add on top of the MSRP.  Don't pay 700 bucks to get nitrogen in your tyres and have the car cleaned an prepared for you.  The delivery fee from the manufacturer covers the latter, and the former is an overpriced scam.  Don't pay for their rust proofing.  If you want these things, there are cheaper and better places to get it done post-purchase.    Other people have mentioned ""dealer invoice"" prices.  In my opinion, forget about this term.  It is borderline jargon.  There is only one number that matters and that is the vehicle's market value.  This is what someone is willing to pay for it.  For both the Civic and the Mazda3, it is a buyer's market.  There is no shortage of these top sellers.  Wait until the end of season, and help clean the dealer's lot.  Finally, even though you don't want to buy now, don't be timid about discussing prices.  It can give you an idea about the market value of the cars you're interested in.  Sometimes this is very close to MSRP, sometimes it is way below.  It even varies year-to-year and location-to-location.   Always discuss the cash price (On-The-Road price).  Don't get sucked in by wanna-be clever salespeople who will flip payment frequencies or term lengths to make you think you're getting a deal.  Good luck and have fun!"

Mazdas right now are really hot, with their new unlimited mileage warranty.  If you don't want to deal with the stupidity, and you want a Mazda, ask for Chris Mielke.

ottawa,3dfyad,Le_Cochon_Noir,3,Thu Jul 16 12:07:02 2015 UTC,"If you're working at the airport, and her working downtown I would recommend Barrhaven (south Nepean) or Riverside South.  If you're in Kanata, both of you will be hitting the heavy eastbound traffic for sure (it can be a parking lot some days, and you'll be driving with the sun in your eyes).  There will be some traffic coming out of Barrhaven as well, especially towards downtown, and a little going to the airport but not nearly as bad as being on the 417.  Not sure about areas in the east end, as we've only lived in the west end for the 6 years we've been here.  If you're more ""hip"" and have a large income, then the Glebe or Westboro would be the place you want to look at.  If your wife is working downtown, I'd suggest using the bus system as parking downtown is really expensive (and if you're in one of the southern areas I suggested above, you can get an express bus downtown in about 40-50 minutes during the week).  There are new houses being built in both areas, but I think Riverside will have the newer, cheaper lots.  Are you looking for a townhouse or a single?  Also, if you want a large backyard then you'll want to buy an older property as most the new subdivisions seem to have really small back lots.  Not sure what you mean about the pedestrian street lights; are you referring to the various bike paths around the city?"

But yeah, Barrhaven and Riverside South make the most sense for suburbs. Possibly even the Hunt Club area but I don't think it makes that big of a difference.  edit: both are a bit of a drag to get to downtown. Barrhaven will at least put you on route 95, but riverside south is supposed to get an otrain extension in like 50+ years when they finally extend it..."

The plan is to eventually have automatic push notifications only to phones directly in path of dangerous storms as has been implemented in the US.

It's just too dangerous to bike on the road. I rarely actually pass someone who's actually walking and if do I'll slow down and either get off my bike or drive well onto the grass. Give me a ticket, it's worth it."
ottawa,3dgaqv,generousthief,4,Thu Jul 16 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, this. I bike along a stretch of Carling near the 417. It's fucking dangerous, and I'll gladly take the ticket if it comes to that. When it's safe to ride on the road, I do. Otherwise, I'm mindful that the sidewalks belong to any pedestrians I come across."
ottawa,3dgaqv,chanaleh,2,Thu Jul 16 02:20:43 2015 UTC,"I used to live out near Hunt Club & Conroy and I also used to use the sidewalk - the sidewalks out there (at least on the south side) are very wide and have a shoulder.  Downtown, where I live now, is a different story. There are people biking on the sidewalks up and down Bank Street all the time. Given how much pedestrian traffic there is this is just dangerous and frustrating. Personally I'd like to see a crackdown on the sidewalk cyclists downtown."
ottawa,3dgaqv,OttabMike,0,Thu Jul 16 18:47:03 2015 UTC,"Bike on the sidewalks in the downtown core is crazy. There's way to many people walking, getting out of cars, coming out of shops, etc..."
ottawa,3dgaqv,generousthief,5,Thu Jul 16 19:22:39 2015 UTC,"Problem is, at a motorist who only drives downtown, I check for pedestrians, and then I check my mirror for bikes when turning right (for example).  I DO NOT look down the sidewalk (often several feet away from the road) as I don't expect bikers.  If I am pulled up and turning right on a red, with my blinker on and no bike lane, I really shouldn't be concerned about bikes passing on the right, either on the road (illegal) or sidwalk (illegal)  I guess in this case, at least at a crosswalk, get off your bike and walk?"
ottawa,3dgaqv,Spazerman,4,Thu Jul 16 03:16:59 2015 UTC,Of course for my safety I would never speed through a crosswalk on my bike because as you mentioned motorists aren't expecting a bicycle in that situation.
ottawa,3dgaqv,generousthief,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:37:33 2015 UTC,Maybe you should START looking out for bikers if you're aware that sometimes they are there and you might annihilate one of them?
ottawa,3dgaqv,flgrntfwl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:46:14 2015 UTC,"At least you're careful around pedestrians.

ottawa,3dgaqv,Valiturus,4,Thu Jul 16 02:12:28 2015 UTC,"The worst is when people zip past me without warning while I'm walking the dogs. Lots of dogs have issues with bikes, and especially with bikes that suddenly spook them from behind! And dogs don't always walk in a straight line, they can move in front of the bike without warning, especially if they have no idea the bike's there.   Triple that for on bridges.

ottawa,3dgaqv,Jobbo_Fett,2,Thu Jul 16 03:58:41 2015 UTC,If your issue is with the use of highway  Many(Most) of the artery roads in Ottawa are highways  Carling = Highway 38 Baseline = Highway 16 Etc  It is not the Motor vehicle traffic act so it has to deal with things like bikes too.
ottawa,3dgaqv,strikt9,2,Thu Jul 16 02:42:33 2015 UTC,Highway is defined as basically any public road. Even a little residential crescent.  The fact that some roads have or had provincial highway numbering is completely separate.

ottawa,3dgaqv,Jobbo_Fett,2,Thu Jul 16 03:38:04 2015 UTC,"Like many other cyclists, I feel much safer most of the time being on the side walk rather than the road.  Luckily, on my way to work, 95% of the roads are 40KM speed limit residential roads. I only cross Wodroffe/Norice and Merivale/Viewmount. To which I use the cross walk. cycling down roads like Merivale, Wodroffe, Baseline the side walk is much safer.  One thing not mentioned is one of the most awkward thing about cycling on side walks is when it's RIGHT in front of people's lane ways. trees and hedges make for poor visibility and makes colliding into reversing vehicles all too easy.  As mentioned in previous posts, warning pedestrians via bell, going well around them helps. but by the end of the day. I'd take a collision with a pedestrian over a vehicle ANY day."
ottawa,3dgaqv,matthew_rs7,-1,Thu Jul 16 05:41:52 2015 UTC,"That's nice that YOU feel safer, too bad it is illegal and not any safer for you or drivers. You can still have a collision with a vehicle when you are on the sidewalk, that is what OP is talking about. I've had a few close calls where the cyclist sped through a crosswalk..."
ottawa,3dgaqv,JSophiAG,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"Yes a collision with a vehicle can still occur, but the chances of that are MUCH less than if I were on the road. And yes, it is best to get off the bike and walk across intersections. Then again, once at a full stop I usually bike only a little faster than walking speed as I accelerate after the cross walk.  Tonight I had a common issue on the road. I was biking on the road and was approaching a 3 way stop to which I was making a left turn. I signal left and slow down to prepare for a stop. The vehicle behind me passes me on my left side as we both hit the stop line. I proceeded to turn left but I had to swerve around the front of the vehicle to turn. There is only 1 lane, this vehicle took advantage of my small size and went beside me. Letting him go first only enables that type of behavior.  Another HUGE factor is buses. Especially on wodroffe, the bus lane is shared with bikes. If you drive down there, you know one intersection has a dedicated bus signal to let them go first. Also being a shared bike lane, I am not allowed to proceed as I am a bike. The bus behind me was pumping his brakes and edging closer to me, then honked when I didn't move. the ONLY place I could have moved was scooting sideways into the painted warning zone of an island. And of course, since I'm apparently a legal vehicle, I am to stay away from those painted lines.  Like many other people, I'll gladly play a $40 ticket and keep biking on the side walk when I feel it's safer. A reminder that EVERYBODY is supposed to analyze 20 seconds of road ahead, regularly observe the entire area. Before turning, look all ways, then the direction you are turning again before moving."

ottawa,3ddf06,L4MB,4,Wed Jul 15 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"You 'avin a giggle?  Why on earth would you wankers bite your arm off about that bollocks when you can go to Pili Pili on Dalhousie?  Ask the lad for half a chicken, medium spicy, cut up with a bit of plantains. Mutt's nuts mate, swear on me mum."
ottawa,3ddf06,gorchitza,3,Wed Jul 15 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"While I'm certainly pleased with the fact that I no longer have to go out to Merival (or Innes/Orleans) to get Nandos, the recent-ish opening of Pili Pili on Dalhousie has hugely curtailed my visits to Nandos. While I think Pili Pili is better than Nandos, Nandos as a franchise is pretty awesome and does an impressively spicy chicken. It will be a great addition to Elgin."
ottawa,3ddf06,sflynn75,6,Wed Jul 15 18:35:01 2015 UTC,Wait. There's a Nando's opening on Elgin Street??!!   EDIT: Just checked and I apparently I missed the previous thread about this.   OH JOYOUS DAY!!!

ottawa,3ddf06,Ninjacherry,2,Wed Jul 15 14:31:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that Nando's chicken sauce is pretty damn good, we usually order a whole chicken... So I guess that someone who likes chicken breast may or may not enjoy it as much, as it doesn't absorb as much of the sauce (not sure if this is your case); also their vegetables are nicely done, and, most of all, their garlic bread is pure awesomeness. I know it's not something most people would know to order at a chicken joint, but their garlic bread is my favourite thing on that menu."

ottawa,3dfu0g,myusernameisokay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:18:06 2015 UTC,Stopped in at an LCBO tonight and was told they never have any extras and they're always short on boxes. I guess I could always take a drive and check out a few more.
ottawa,3dfu0g,hunderpants,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:01:35 2015 UTC,Check at the Wine Rack. Call in the morning and ask somebody to set them aside for you. They are usually willing to do so.
