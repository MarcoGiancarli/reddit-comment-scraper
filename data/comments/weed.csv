weed,3e23lj,17hourhigh,3,Tue Jul 21 10:50:51 2015 UTC,You're lucky. The first time I ever smoked weed I smoked a blunt and then took a dab of oil. I stayed high for at least a day and a half because I didn't have a tolerance. Now I can do twice that and it won't last half as long.

So me and my brother with an oz between us ended up hotboxing the caravan. Day 2 and we'd ran out because all of our plans were shit without my nephew being there, so we had to go on the hunt for more. We were a good few hundred miles away from home but we called one of our other brothers who used to deal to come and drop off to us. We offered him double the money and he turned it down, he would of been getting £200 for £100s worth. At least £50 pure profit in it for him, we asked my other brother to drop it and he wouldn't but he was at work at the time: so here comes the best part..his boss walks in on the conversation on loudspeaker and started chatting to us (not knowing where we were) and then my brother turned round and asked the best possible question ever, ""You used to live in Hastings, didn't you boss?"" To which he replied ""Yeah only moved here a few months ago, why is that where you boys are now?"" And he told us to find the biggest skatepark in the city, so we did. There's only 5 skateparks there, and of course we had to go to the right one last! We spot some kids at the entrance and asked them for a dealer, he gave us a number, and said he'll text him with our number. A few seconds later we get a text to walk down the road to the apartment with the green door (we were on the wrong side of the road buzzing the wrong apartment lol) finally found it, climbed the 6 flights of steep fucking cuntsteps and got to the sacred white door we'd been waiting for all day. It had a little hole in it and when we knocked on there, we were told to stick our money through the hole. Hesitant we did it, because how else could we get high? And we were standing there for too long, we looked at eachother ready to kick the door down when we hear ""Hold out yah hands."" Normally for the £120 we paid we would get a half oz, but it rained upon us! Bags upon bags were spilling out ""Sorry it's in small bits, rarely sell any big lots these days"" we hear as they're coming, we weighed them out to be just over an oz. And I absolutely swear to god, we're smelling these bags walking down the road and they smell of pepper, and it was the single strongest shit I've ever smoked. We smoked a single joint and had giggles for over a half hour, and we rarely ever get the giggles, maybe once a year.   It was one mad experience."
weed,3dygox,GetMoneySmokeWeed,2,Mon Jul 20 17:09:28 2015 UTC,I would schedule weekends with 6 hr travel times to New York because that was where the weed was and also but not really to see my family.
weed,3dygox,volvyw,2,Mon Jul 20 18:24:52 2015 UTC,"As this turns out...not a happy ending but nonetheless a lesson well learned  I was broke for awhile working a part time job and getting partial unemployment therefore the only apartment I could afford was in a neighborhood that could only best be described as ""ghetto"". I lived in Indiana and had a buddy who regularly made trips back and forth to Chicago and would bring me high grade hydro at an incredible price. It was about February this had gone on every Friday for months till finally the day came his job ended and the Chicago trips stopped. Asked him if he knew where I could pick up locally and he took me to a projects building and introduced to me to his local guy. Again went there for months all winter long, no problems. So here is where I realize what a stupid idea me going there was. Summer rolls around and I go there to do my usual pickup, there's roughly 3-4 guys standing in front of the building, I ignore them going in and as I enter one of them yells ""yo, he ain't home"" ignore them and proceed up 3 flights of stairs anyway turns out he isn't there. As I'm coming back down and exiting the building a different guy stops me and says ""what you need"" bad feelings aside I thought ok cool might get some anyway. So I tell him and he wants the money. I'm not that naive so I tell him that I need to follow him before paying him. So he takes me through the first building out back and through a second building. Exact thought at this point ""man I just FU"". Takes me to a door on the bottom floor and tells me to stand right outside...he goes in, ten minutes later two different guys come out but not him I thought ""screw this"" knocked on the door some guy answers and says ""he ain't here"" I say ""wtf he do, go out the window"" suddenly I got four guys in my face threatening to beat my ass. Told em keep the money it wasn't worth it. Long story short, basically got robbed shoulda listened to my instinct and this was a stupid thing I did to try and smoke  P.s. - at the risk of sounding racist, WHICH I MOST DEFINITELY AM NOT, adding to the story the place I was trying to pick up at was dominant in African Americans and I was the only white guy there so I'm pretty sure I walked in there with a giant target on my back"

weed,3dvetp,6ftsloth,2,Sun Jul 19 21:12:33 2015 UTC,In Denmark u mix the weed with tobacco in an attempt to use less weed per blunt or joint. Bong mix is normally made by mixing hash with toasted and warm tobacco. U get super stoned
weed,3dvetp,RagingRag,2,Sun Jul 19 21:51:30 2015 UTC,"You can make a bong out of a bunch of things. When I visit back home and have nothing to smoke out of I usually craft a bong out of a water bottle and an empty pen.  Apples are better. Stick a hole in the top and a hole in the side until they create an L-shaped tunnel inside.   If you leave tobacco in the blunt it's basically a spliff, you usually empty the entire thing and replace with ganj for a traditional blunt, but tobacco mixed in is just a smoker's preference."

I experience that in certain situations I'm calm and look at things positive while others rage about it. I started hanging out more with my friends and immadiately lost the fun of staring at my monitor for hours. The good thing for me is, that i don't really get addicted too much. I only smoke on the weekend or if there's a special event. As I read, you get addicted more easy so I recommend you to only smoke once or twice a month and with a friend, because I experienced smoking alone gets you addicted faster. Maybe give him/her 5 bucks and you chill out for an evening. If this works for you, you can continue but if you feel the urge of smoking more maryjane I'd stop. I hope it helped you, see ya"
weed,3duhr6,Daanizzle_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:13:19 2015 UTC,"A little background on myself with marijuana. I started smoking when I was ~18 years old. I was a very immature kid that just wanted to get out and party and try some things I've never done. I never considered myself to have an addictive personality, but I found myself smoking a lot. I went from smoking once every blue moon to 10 times a day around a set schedule because I didn't want to be sober. Now a lot of that contributed to me trying to find something to fight off my inner demons and help me cope with whatever issue I was having at that time. It very quickly turned into me finding the negative things in my life (sometimes very very very petty issues) and would have to go smoke to help myself cope with it. I took about a 4 year hiatus after I realized that I was just being extremely lazy and wasn't being productive. It drove me crazy to think of how many days and nights that I wasted in my past. I recently decided to pick it up again after a recent trip out to Colorado with a good friend of mine. I decided that if I were to smoke on a ""regular basis"" that I would absolutely have to pace myself and not find a reason to smoke, but to just let it happen naturally. Ever since I've picked back up smoking, I have seen a nice jump in my life. Weed has always helped me see the good in life.  My advice to you would be to pace yourself. If you feel like you are getting in too deep, find yourself another outlet. Surround yourself with a support group that will do whatever they can to keep you with a positive outlook and will hold you accountable. Part of my issue was the people I used to be friends with were very toxic for me so I eventually had to turn away from all that. Now I have a set of people around me that love and care for me as much as I do for them and that has been another huge help for me. Hell, if you ever feel like you need someone to lean on, feel free to send me a message. I'll be more than happy to help you figure some things out.   Good luck with your decision. At the end of the day, do what feels what's best for you but never hesitate to reach out if you need to :)"

weed,3do78l,DIABLO258,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:56:27 2015 UTC,I went to a house party and I got too stoned. I was literally off my tits. I then woke up their (the persons house party) neighbours house the next morning with no recollection of the night before. I go upstairs thinking that I'm still in the same house as the house party and I see an elderly woman in bed and I ran for it. Apparently she called the police but she didn't press charges.
weed,3do78l,qwertyowen_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"One time me and my friend were chilling at his dealers house. Some guy I didn't know who was friends with the dealer picked up what he thought was a dab off the TV and asked us if it looked like a dab. We all thought it was a booger, and told him not to but he took it anyway like a fiend. Apparently it was a booger, he puked."
weed,3dncy7,JohnFaulk,4,Fri Jul 17 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"Do your research BEFORE you go. A buddy and I made the mistake of trying to figure out what to do/where to go after we were already there and that was slightly difficult. Most of it was trying to figure out the laws and where to go and all that jazz. If you are going to Denver, Greenwerks (I think that's how you spell it) was the place we went for recreational. You can only buy/carry 7 grams on you if you are out of state and you can only pay with cash (at least that's how it worked at Greenwerks). Do not pull out your camera to take pictures in there. My buddy asked and they were polite, but very firm about no pictures.   As far as places to go, I think there was a place close to Denver that was 250 bucks a night that was ""Marijuana friendly"". You rent out a room and you can smoke in the building as much as you want. Apparently they offered a chauffeur to take you wherever you wanted to go and it was all included. We did not do this because we did zero research until we were there and could not get a room in time.   Overall I would say the experience for us was a 7/10. I'm sure it would have been better if we studied it a little more and expanded our options a little.   Good luck on your endeavors!"

And your light needs to be closer to your plants... See how the stems are very skinny and tall? You dont want that...what type of light are you using? CFL? Keep your light about 8-12 inches away. but not too close where its going to burn them..

Weed will slow that down. That's why you see older people doing it usually 15 and up. Cause their brain is almost done growing (more like 20 and up). But don't bring it through the airport.
