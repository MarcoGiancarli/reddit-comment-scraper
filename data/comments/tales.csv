It reuses a ton of assets, including pretty much all NPCs (just gives them different clothes). There's even a main character (sort of) that gets reused and iirc it wasn't even as a reference, it just felt incredibly lazy.  Zestiria is closer to Graces in combat than the other games, but the main thing it borrows from the Xillias is the weakness system from X2. Not that it matters at ALL because you spend the whole game mashing the attack button and then just going into kamui form and wrecking things. Repeat ad nauseum whether it's normal mobs or a boss.  Also if you play Zestiria, you're always as broke as you were in X2 unless you walk everywhere because they made Quick Travel crazy expensive each time you use it.  imo ToZ will only be worth it if they at least fix the graphics/framerate in the PS4/PC versions and even then I have a feeling you might just wanna skip it, op."

Word map, vibrant color palette, very likable cast, side quests that are actually worth something (not just filler... Xillia 2) and a combat system on a 2D plain (for the most part).   Than Xillia came out... and they went all dark and realistic on us. This is not a Final Fantasy game! I want an unique art style that remind me of an anime. Also f*ck motion tracking for cutscene! It just looks weird to me, I prefer the simple animations from Symphonia, Abyss and Vesperia."
tales,3e2x1m,Hulkkis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"In terms of Zestiria I can agree with the camera angles, not so much ""Really bad"" but at times (In closed spaces) it can be really broken, I like the combat system personally, it's also a lot faster paced (In terms of getting in and out of battle) due to how it transitions and just, flows better. It's still 4 player co-op though I haven't tried it, the box claims 4 players. I don't play Tales games co-op and the one time I did it was just with one friend, I'm assuming that the human player takes control in fusion but outside of that control is still normal, which isn't the worst thing in the world considering the others don't do anything outside of combat anyway, but I can understand being a little upset by it (Though again, I don't play co-op myself and I don't know of anyone personally who's ever even tried it). That and the Alisha thing isn't ""Waifu Wars"", it's the fact of a character (That seemed to be) pushed as the female lead of the series being absent for most of the game and then having DLC put behind a paywall if you didn't get it within the first month or so.  TL;DR Zestiria's combat flows well, sometimes has broken camera angles, Alisha paid DLC content, still 4 player co-op but probably taken away in fusion."

Now on NG+, assuming that I have 300 more battles and assuming that Luke were to kill them all single-handedly, it'd still be a lower damage rating than the Soul Crush, I think.   Then there's the catalysts for everyone else. In any given normal battle, it's usually just Guy and Luke getting the kills, so it'll be a really fucking long time before any of the Catalysts get to the level of their owners' best weapons.  Soul Crush is fairly easily achieved at the mid-point of the game, so I'm not sure if I'll even bother pursuing the Catalysts for another 2 playthroughs."

While it is the only officially localized release of the game, its pretty bad and has one of the most hilariously bad mistranslations of all time.  PSP would be the best version if you knew Japanese since its the PSP version with lots of voice acting and extra content. Sadly it does not have an English patch, so you'll probably want to stick with the PS1 version.  The SNES version's patch also has its own charm to it.

tales,3dv097,Prutzle,5,Sun Jul 19 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"There's no real pattern behind it. The creators are just trying to fit some realism into it. ""Why is it certain people have these abilities and others don't?"".  Or the better question would be ""If everyone has these abilities then why isn't there world peace or it be more like Mad Max, and if no one has these abilities then why aren't my characters treated as gods?""  There has to be some explanation here. In Phantasia I believe only elves could use magic, which was how it was in Symphonia. Various characters had various abilities and that was only expressed through ""training"" or effort. In Symphonia all abilities that aren't magic are explained by exspheres. In Vesperia, Blastia. Not everyone has these and so there's no world peace or all out power struggles.  Then the question is ""Why doesn't all of the Tales series use the same stuff?"" There's multiple answers to this. 1. It's boring. 2. They're all different worlds. 3. Certain things basically can't be repeated.  Let's take Exspheres for example. I won't spoil too much but there is a little bit of spoilage here. Throughout the course of the game the player will find out why they don't want to use Exspheres, and so in later titles it wouldn't make sense for players to be forced to use these and the issue just be flat put ignored, hence a new method must show up.  The last hit about why they do this is the realism behind it. Now you might say ""wait here, mana lobes aren't a thing that's real"" and you would be right, but that isn't the point. The idea is that these fantasy worlds have characters that realistically are thinking. One day they'd have to ask ""where does magic come from, and what exactly is magic?"" Once you define magic it then ceases to be this unexplainable force, and so magic turns into physics. It becomes a demonstration of applied physics instead of magic. So then if it's not called magic, then what is it called?  And that's how we wind up with all these terms."

Mana comes from trees and brains (Bra-a-ins braiins). Graces' eleth is a mineral.  The change in the ""Nomenclature"" every game is also an excuse to not recycle any good gimmicks that worked in previous games. That's why we can't have the Eleth Mixer in Vesperia.

tales,3domwq,AggressionSsb,8,Sat Jul 18 06:04:58 2015 UTC,No.  Get a PSTV when it's on sale for around $50.00  Play Tales of hearts R and Persona 4G. Put away PSTV
tales,3domwq,Ed88,2,Sat Jul 18 00:40:45 2015 UTC,Lol I bought the PSTV just for those two games
tales,3domwq,robkillsyou,4,Sat Jul 18 10:30:22 2015 UTC,"Is Tales of Hearts R worth getting?  Hell yes, my favorite cast so far and it's a good game in general. The best character interactions and dialogues.   However if you're getting a vita solely for Hearts R its not worth it.   If you can afford the vita + Persona 3, Persona 4G, Persona 4 Dancing All night, Hearts R, and are interested in playing other JRPGs then its worth it.   Not sure about PSTV. Never had one."
tales,3domwq,Sychotics,2,Sat Jul 18 04:52:37 2015 UTC,"Considering how expensive the Vita is in general, not even including their memory cards that are sold separately, it's not worth it for a single game. The PSTV is a better option. If you want something portable and have a lot of games you're wanting to play then it's nice and I'd recommend getting it. It's a really beautiful system and I loved having it for the short time I did."
tales,3domwq,pillowcased,2,Sat Jul 18 01:05:07 2015 UTC,"I got a Vita for Hearts R, and it was indeed more expensive than anticipated (especially since I bought used, which didn't include even the included stuff).

tales,3domwq,mysticrudnin,2,Sat Jul 18 04:30:27 2015 UTC,"Hearts R has the best 3D battle system of the entire series, and is overall a big contender for the best post-Vesperia game, alongside Xillia 2.   I wouldn't get a Vita just for it though. But with Persona 4, Ys, Digimon and a whole lot of good games, I'd get a cheap Vita, because it has a damn fine Library."
tales,3domwq,NotTheBees_ARGH,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:00:03 2015 UTC,"Totally, it would probably be my favorite game on Vita if not for P4G.  Seriously though, it is a really fun game.

tales,3domwq,corymatthews423,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:07:39 2015 UTC,"So I'm late to the party but there are some things you can look forward to for the Vita if you like portability. It has tales games, atlus games, some classics from PSP. A bonus if you do have PS4 is that you can (for the most part) ALL your PS4 games on your vita if you have an internet connection or if you're having a long poop. However since you mentioned you probably aren't interested in other games... Not really worth the purchase.  As others have mentioned PSTV is the cheap alternative. It's basically a Vita for TV. Definitely a better way to go if you don't want things on the go. However I think you'll need a Dualshock 3/4 controller."

They are a different style of jrpg, but typically considered fantastic.  They have a very-very-very anime inspired theme, while also having some incredibly dark points (murder, depression, suicide, etc). Combat is turn based, but very difficult with a focus on needing to use strategy (moves to lower defense, raise attack, or elemental type weaknesses). The characters are fun and go through some heavy character growth."

tales,3domwq,makisodamnkawaii,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:25:12 2015 UTC,The battle system is fun but the story is a bit meh at best but I got the game for $14 (it was worth it). I don't feel like replaying it to be honest. Only 1 character stood out for me (Beryl). The vita is only worth it if you like at least like 6 games in the system and you really want to play them on the road.  Hopefully I can enjoy Tales of Innocence R on my Vita.  I'd say get a PS TV at $39 once it hits that price again and can find a deal for a 16/32gb card.
tales,3domwq,fvig2001,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:07:40 2015 UTC,"Yes. The story is meh, but if you like Tales battle system, you should try it.  Heck, play it just for this quote.  ""Kor Meteor doesn't try, Kor Meteor DOES!"""

tales,3domwq,EzonPin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"Pick up the pstv. I got the PSTV for free recently as a bundle with my PS4. Picked up this game while in store new for like 20 euro (very cheap, around 15 usd). Loving it so far. Graphics are of course not the best because its a handheld game but it doesn't take away from the game itself.  I'm about 20 hours in and loving it. Its not dubbed with cheesy English voices too so if you're a purist like me that's a plus. The only downside is pulling off certain attacks where you need to touch the screen is very hard on the Ps Tv as you only have a second to react. But otherwise its great and I recommend it, I'm enjoying it more than the original.  Also Chalcedony joins your party in this version and is very fun to use."
tales,3domwq,RS_Ramza,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:22:19 2015 UTC,"Hell yes, it's definitely worth getting it. The real question is, if the Vita itself is worth getting. If you're absolutely sure there's nothing of your interest in the Vita library, then pick the PSTV. In my case, not even the best game ever would force me to buy a console just for it (which is why I haven't played Vesperia...sob). But for the Vita, having in my hands P4G, Hearts R, Ys Celceta and a nice Vita deal was all it took for me to be convinced ;)"
tales,3domwq,LoonyMoonie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"Lol i just bought a PS VITA today for 200$ in a combo and got tales of heart R, the game sold me. Im playing it so far and I love the story and how it makes me hate a certain character and love a certain character which pretty much conveys that it feels real in a way. Not gonna lie i kinda bought it for just tales atm (I work so i dont mind the money) but other jrpgs as well too."
tales,3domwq,bakkuman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:51:45 2015 UTC,"It is good, but not a system seller. The Vita does have a lot of good games though, not to mention the ps1 games you can grab on it.  Consider looking at Danganronpa 1 and 2, which are very very good games and in my opinion the best on the system, but you really need to avoid spoilers. If you liked the look of those, Persona 4 Golden, Tales of Hearts R, and a few other games I think they and the ability to access old playstation games would justify the purchase. If you're really only interested in Hearts R then I wouldn't, but really do some research on all the games being mentioned in this read."
tales,3domwq,sirwaltermanny,0,Sat Jul 18 09:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yes it's worth it! I got it this week, and I have been really enjoying it. I'm playing it on the ps tv instead of the vita, and the only thing that I can't figure out with it is how to do the combat portrait tap with a ps3 controller lol, but that hasn't really effected anything too much.    Well the story is awesome, the characters are great, and I would highly recommend getting it! It's even got something of a final fantasy feel to it in some places. I would not, however, say it's worth getting a pstv or a vita just for this game. As super as it is, it's not worth all the money of a system, and the game. But if you have a vita or a pstv I would highly recommend getting it."
tales,3domwq,terrSC,2,Sat Jul 18 09:04:45 2015 UTC,"In the settings on the PSTV theirs a option where when you click in the stick it turns into ""tap mode"" so I'm guessing if you use that you would be able to use this ""combat portrait tap"""

tales,3dm64m,Sparky81,2,Fri Jul 17 14:24:57 2015 UTC,Somethings can't be modded to 60fps. Sometimes it's synced with the game logic and putting at 60fps just doubles the game speed.
tales,3dm64m,CSFFlame,3,Fri Jul 17 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"While true, the GC version ran a 60fps in battle, so I doubt there's a logic lock."

If you stood in certain spots where it wasn't rendering much, it could jump to 60fps and stay there.  The game speed did not double, ergo I assume the Tales team actually knows how to program engines properly."
tales,3dm64m,mysticrudnin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:33:53 2015 UTC,"while this is true, i think there are examples of this happening in the past and modders still managed to pull it off  also, as CSFFlame mentions, Tales games do often have slowdowns, and game logic doesn't take the hit as well from what i can tell"
tales,3dm64m,AlteisenX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:15:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it was only 30 because the ps2 was weak and because the ps3 tried to force a higher resolution. Older games are not tied to game physics. Also, nevermind 60fps. I'm gunna play this game at 144fps. We need to show our support. Bringing tales to the pc is the most important thing for tales ever.

tales,3dm64m,Thrashinuva,4,Fri Jul 17 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"Well no, that was 720p (1080p is over twice the pixels of 720p)with no special AA or anything.

tales,3dkg9m,Sychotics,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:17:22 2015 UTC,"iirc last year for Xillia 2, the preorders for the CE went up around April for us, with the game releasing in August. Going by that logic, they should have been up already so presumably if we're getting it, it should start showing up at retailers pretty soon. I know they're still sorting out UK retailers so it could be the same case with Canada.  However, I'm not certain it will even come to Canada. Our dollar has been so terrible lately, in order to keep it at the same price point as in the US, it would have to be ~$190 with taxes here which I'm sure very few people would buy. So I assume we're probably not getting it at all or we'll be getting very few copies since only the diehard fans are going to bother with something that pricey.  It might be safer to find a place in the US to preorder from if you have to have it. (Keep in mind shipping + import taxes could be pretty hefty.) You could always cancel an existing order it does come to stores here."

tales,3dkg9m,Sychotics,2,Fri Jul 17 05:13:40 2015 UTC,"Well I think you and I have different definitions of ""quite cheap"", haha. With shipping that does sound about right for what I expect the CE to cost in Canada if it does come here though."

Maybe Berseria, because i'm loving what we've seen of the protagonist so far; not really a fan of ""Sorey."""
tales,3dkg9m,Sychotics,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:54:01 2015 UTC,"Slightly off Tales topic, but since you  and /u/Cherrim appear to be Canadian, and we're talking about USD/CAD conversion rates, I thought I'd just leave this here to prove that not ALL Americans view the Looney as less."

tales,3dlxrr,CrossxFyre,2,Fri Jul 17 09:53:52 2015 UTC,Here's what to do:  Buy the ps4 CE. Sell the game. Buy the game again for ps3.
tales,3dlxrr,jupiter95,2,Sat Jul 18 01:36:34 2015 UTC,It's a money thing. Tales is considered too niche.
tales,3dlxrr,AggressionSsb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:47:56 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand why they avoided PS3 though. It's not like they have to do something on the game, they only have to put things into the box and exchange the PS3 copy to the PS4 if PS3 CE doesn't sell well."
tales,3dlxrr,Pentridge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:41:03 2015 UTC,Yeah ... sorry but I don't think it's possible ....
tales,3dlxrr,AzuresX19,-1,Fri Jul 17 10:05:07 2015 UTC,I can't help but dream.
tales,3dlxrr,Thrashinuva,-2,Fri Jul 17 09:54:19 2015 UTC,"I understand the desire. Not everyone has a PS4 yet and the PS3 CE exists outside of NA. However PS4 is the next step. We've experienced this since Super Nintendo until now. You either move forward or you don't move at all. I'm not saying this decision was 100% correct, or that you should be happy about it, but I wouldn't go around hoping that a petition could possibly change anything about it.  It's like asking for them to port Tales of Innocence for the Nintendo DS. They just wouldn't do it no matter how much you asked. You'd be lucky for a digital version of it on the 3DS."
tales,3djq6z,hurious,2,Thu Jul 16 20:45:52 2015 UTC,"Concerned about what exactly?  I am confused by you question.  You can still order from Gamestop and have it shipped even according to you post, so I don't understand what the problem is."

tales,3djq6z,Sychotics,2,Thu Jul 16 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"I've ordered from gamestop quite a bit, they're better than best buy as i've always had my pre-orders arrive on release date. Best buy I always have to wait at least 3-5 days. Nothing wrong with either, the only difference seems to be the shipping time."
tales,3djq6z,corymatthews423,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:25:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I guess that makes sense.  Well, I have never heard any particular complaints about their shipping process, like things not coming on time or being damaged.  I have not ordered much through them, but what I have came just fine."
tales,3djq6z,Thrashinuva,2,Thu Jul 16 22:26:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be too worried. The only problem I ever had with them was the inability to change my credit card info which had expired before the release of my order, that and no free shipping. You got your order in only a day or so after stock went out on Amazon, the most popular site for buying things online, even video games. You should probably be okay stock-wise. As far as everything else is concerned, I've never had any trouble with them shipping my stuff. Everything else worse just as well as Amazon."

tales,3dgw8t,HarryWang94,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:28:19 2015 UTC,"I'm almost thinking it just won't come out here because our dollar has fallen so much since even the last Tales release.   I calculated it yesterday and if they sold it based on the exchange rate with USD, ours would come out to $190 with taxes included and I don't think enough people would buy it at that price for them to even bother shipping it here. The other option would be taking a loss on each CE they sell here. They can't just crank up the price $10/$20 like they did with the Xillias and still make a profit compared to the US. :s"
tales,3dgw8t,Cherrim,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"Dang :/  Well I do hope they sell it here anyways but I can't say I'd bite the bullet at $190. I almost ordered it from their website but it came out to over $200. I paid a lot for the Xillia 2 CE and that ended up getting cheap really quickly, I just can't justify it this time. At this rate I'll just buy the PC version."

My advice is kill boss monsters to pay your loan, the rest of it can get fucked unless you actually want to do it."

You increase SP by beating a set # of enemies, so there is that incentive, plus I would always try to finish a job where the reward was an extractor.

tales,3csolb,BlamelessVestalsLot,-3,Sun Jul 12 20:44:13 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you have no experience with terrible ports? Developers make terrible games and then hype them up. THEN when people preorder, they get all the money and the buyer gets a piece of shit. AKA Arkham knight or watch dogs. I'm trying to help you people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y  edit: wtf? you're a pcmasterrace who LIKES preorders?"
tales,3csolb,AggressionSsb,3,Sun Jul 12 21:03:25 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you have no experience with terrible ports?    No I do, but steam refunds are a thing which means all the negative things about pre-ordering are gone. Once the game release you can keep it and if you don't just return it. Pre-orders are an essential part of the video game industry at this point. Is it pro consumer? Of course not, but just because it's not doesn't mean it a terrible thing.   edit: wtf? you're a pcmasterrace who LIKES preorders?     I only post on that subreddit to make sure people don't buy crappy PCs, I'm not a part of that fanbase. And no I don't like pre-orders I don't care about them but hating on the practice because the constantly overused cherry picked games got a bad reception doesn't mean anything when there are several other games that were released without issue using the practice."
tales,3csolb,BlamelessVestalsLot,-3,Sun Jul 12 22:54:00 2015 UTC,"which means all the negative things about pre-ordering are gone.   Pre order game, looks good in the start, but suffers from tons of bugs in the later game. Too bad since you already spent over two hours on it.  Pre order game, bugs, promised patch within two weeks so the owner does not refund, then the patch gets delayed. Too bad!  Pre order game, devs then focus on a totally different system weeks later. Lookin at you, Elite Dangerous. Just to show a few.  The refunds are for only if you haven't played the game for 2 hours. Once you play for 2 hours you're screwed.   Is it pro consumer? Of course not, but just because it's not doesn't mean it a terrible thing.   That's exactly what it means"
tales,3csolb,AggressionSsb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:09:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying pre-ordering doesn't have it's faults but the practice is not the one to blame, the developers are.   That's exactly what it means    No, you're thinking only of yourself. Game development benefits from pre-orders quality assurance, advertising/marketing data, if people like the concept (so other studios can incorporate elements within their games which happened with the Tales games back when they were developed by two different teams), etc."
tales,3csolb,BlamelessVestalsLot,-1,Mon Jul 13 03:50:44 2015 UTC,"Your argument doesn't even make sense. I'm saying preorders are bad but you say    practice is not the one to blame, the developers are   Okay, so then then the developers are shit. That's even worse.    Game development benefits from pre-orders quality assurance   It ABSOLUTELY does not. If anything it guarantees that the game will have no follow up patches. They have absolutely no reason to care once their game has a certain copies sold.   advertising/marketing data   That... doesn't even make sense. This is reddit, anyone who wants to know about this game already does.   if people like the concept   Nobody likes the possibility of being ripped off. That's all preordering guarantees."
tales,3csolb,AggressionSsb,2,Mon Jul 13 04:17:04 2015 UTC,"Your argument doesn't even make sense.     It's simple to understand.      Okay, so then then the developers are shit. That's even worse.      Nothing new, shitty developers will always find ways to gain more money especially when new practices like DLCs for examples are introduced.      It ABSOLUTELY does not. If anything it guarantees that the game will have no follow up patches. They have absolutely no reason to care once their game has a certain copies sold.      Wrong, but okay.     That... doesn't even make sense. This is reddit, anyone who wants to know about this game already does.      Video game developers and publishers want to market beyond reddit, they want their video game to be as successful as possible, crazy right?   Nobody likes the possibility of being ripped off. That's all preordering guarantees.    Okay buddy, you don't want to like pre-orders that's fine with you, you're allowed to vote for your wallet but disregarding the fact that pre-orders are actually useful just because ""hurr durr pre-orders are bad"" is just silly. Hell, some of the things you even said don't even apply to pre-orders.       looks good in the start, but suffers from tons of bugs in the later game. Too bad since you already spent over two hours on it. Pre order game, devs then focus on a totally different system weeks later. Lookin at you, Elite Dangerous. Just to show a few.       Pre-ordering will not have changed the outcome of people who were interested in the game since it would have been to early to tell. People on steam praise a game after 3-4 hours especially highly anticipated ones.    But whatever it seems you're a troll since you joked about Saturo Iwata's death so I'm going to end this debate here."
tales,3csolb,BlamelessVestalsLot,-2,Mon Jul 13 04:52:18 2015 UTC,"I love how all you said was ""I'm wrong"". There was literally no evidence of my being wrong and if anything made my argument stronger. All you did was admit that developers are shitty because they create preorders. Preorders aren't useful for anyone. There is absolutely no argument for that. All it does is let the developers to fuck over the consumers."

As with previous guides, expect Amazon's price to be a bit under retail.  The Xillia 2 limited edition guide is still up for $24.58 ($39.99 retail)."
tales,3cnml0,taurussieben,11,Thu Jul 9 08:37:38 2015 UTC,"The TL;DR version of this is that some people got pissed that their waifu got less screentime than expected and as such, threw a hissy by giving Tales of Zestiria 1-star reviews on Amazon. Alternatively, TOZ was overhyped and fell short of expectations.  The longer version is a little spoilery, so please bear with me.  Before TOZ was released, there was, of course, a lot of promotional material. In the said promotional material, Alisha was more or less being promoted as the heroine of the story, even getting an LE mystic arte and an Alter figure to boot. But in the actual game, she comes and goes in your party and eventually permanently leaves it. She doesn't even join your party in post-game quests. So as not to waste her DLC, Rose shares the same set of costumes as she does, but it's not enough to quell the rage of those expecting her to be a more permanent member of the party. Also, her LE MA is hers and hers alone, so there's nothing that could be done about that. To top off this fiasco, Baba later on said in an interview that there was no heroine in the story and it was up to the player to choose who it was.  So yes, this was a case of mismarketing at its finest, and it manifested as 1-star reviews. There's also a good number of problems with the gameplay itself, like the horrible camera angles, some frame skip issues and loading slowdowns, and the horrible warping system, which people chose to harp on. And for some, the thing between Sorey and Mikleo was also rather unexpected and turned them off. Some otaku (possibly homophobic) even went as far to claim in their 1-star reviews that ""this game was made for fujoshi"". That kind of thing. I say there was a mismatch of expectations as most of the population was expecting a heterosexual main pairing (as is the previous norm in Tales games), but the closest pairing we have to canon happens to be homosexual. I guess even the straight males who played that game felt the strong homo between those two people.  My personal opinion on the matter is that while fans had the right to be angry about the mismarketing of Alisha, I think people need to eventually get over it and/or not make that big of a deal out of it. The whole Alisha thing (and Rose hate) got so bad that (1) Kosuke Fujishima, the character designer for Rose had to take a short leave from twitter due to all the hate he received (2) Hideo Baba, the producer, hasn't made an appearance in any public events in a while (3) Mikako Komatsu, the voice actress of Rose, bowed down and apologized to the audience during TOF2015 (not to mention the rumors in 2chan that the audience was going to boo her during the event). The ""Save Alisha"" movement got so bad that there was tons of memes about it for a while. A good bit of fanwork then involved bashing of how the other party members treated her and Bamco's big marketing fail.  As someone who has played the game (or at least, half of it), I say that despite its flaws, I did find it enjoyable. Armitization is fun and in terms of controlling characters, I especially loved messing around with Edna because of her interesting weapon, ahaha. On the subject of characters, the cast is extremely lovable and the interactions present in the game are simply priceless.  This was a rather long post, but I hoped I managed to answer your question.  EDIT: Added a little elaboration on my point regarding Sorey and Mikleo ."
tales,3cnml0,DimensionSlip,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:15:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your time, and writing the post, I think I know get what happened. It's a bit sad that fans are escalating this much over a game. Voicing dissatisfaction is allright... but then there is also to much. Regardless I will look forward to Zestiria, thanks a lot!"
tales,3cnml0,DimensionSlip,2,Fri Jul 10 07:23:31 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I think most of the hate has generally toned down by now, but it was really bad around the first month Zestiria came out. In any case, those reviews don't really speak for the whole group of people that bought and played the game. If there's one thing indicative of the game's, well, ""worthiness"", it's the fact that it's been getting a lot of merch left and right. I highly doubt Bamco would consider making that much merch for a game that doesn't sell well.  And yes, please do look forward to Zestiria! Despite its flaws, it's quite an enjoyable game."
tales,3cnml0,NotTheBees_ARGH,5,Fri Jul 10 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"I did like how the japanese players actually grew a damn spine for once and gave Baba so much shit over Zestiria.  Even if it had to be the Alisha thing to spur them into action, I like how there's a entire wiki dedicated to tearing Zestiria a new asshole over everything wrong with it.   They're even giving Bamco lots of complaints about the abusive DLC practices. Maybe, just maybe, we'll see some good changes going forward."
tales,3cnml0,NewComer22,2,Thu Jul 9 23:31:24 2015 UTC,"I dont know the details, but in the story happens something with a character. And the japanese dislike that. Im afraid of spoiler, so i dont research any further."

tales,3cnml0,Sychotics,4,Thu Jul 9 10:43:44 2015 UTC,"That and they made said character DLC, which was fine for a week or two, until you had to start paying (1300 yen/$10) for it, which is common in a lot of western games but over there... I don't think so. It's the first time for a Tales game to have extra story put behind a pay wall at least."
tales,3cnml0,Hulkkis,3,Thu Jul 9 11:25:06 2015 UTC,"It's because they advertised Alisha to be the main female protagonist and she apparently leaves extremely early in the game. They even sold figures of her and everything, along with being on the cover the game and being in several magazines, when she's barely in the game. I was quite pissed myself, it was a good character design, and she looked really likeable."
tales,3cnml0,Rhamblings,2,Sat Jul 11 00:04:12 2015 UTC,just really REALLY scummy way to do dlc. Not something i expected from japanese devs.
