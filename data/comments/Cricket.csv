Cricket,3e1tjv,justarslan,22,Tue Jul 21 08:31:41 2015 UTC,Ian Chappell refused to commentate on a limited-overs series between India and Australia in 2013 because the broadcaster conveyed to him that he would be subject to BCCI restrictions. The terms for employment were that commentators couldn't criticise Indian team selection or disagree with the board's position on the Decision Review System or discuss administrative matters.  Is this still the case? I seem to remember Ian Healy's infamous rant about Indians and the DRS when they toured there last year
Cricket,3e1tjv,reap7,13,Tue Jul 21 13:29:35 2015 UTC,"You can criticize the BCCI when you are not on their payroll. When India tour Australia, the Channel 9 guys have no contract with BCCI so they are free to fire away while Star guys do."

Cricket,3e1tjv,reap7,13,Tue Jul 21 18:02:40 2015 UTC,tl;dr Indian cricket and commentators are soulless and cannot be honest in their opinion due to corruption and having to answer to the BCCI.

It does not do justice to the thousands of kids who play in the maidans of mumbai, the streets of delhi or the fields in small towns and villages. Take a look at the glint in the eye of the 9 year old who wakes up at 6 am during his summer vacations to play a game with his friends and try to imitate his heroes, and juxtapose that with the unrepentant faces of the grade A douchenozzles who run the BCCI.

He's a genuine ranter of the game. No one in India is half as good a ranter as him.  His puts together all my muddled thoughts perfectly.  But I think most people here are maybe missing the crux of his argument.  Commentators toeing the line and players keeping to themselves isn't the biggest issue. By stifled voices, Mukul was highlighting the menace of conflict of interest. In any other country it would be downright criminal to have a situation wherein the team's captain is employed by the board's president and who's a partner (undeclared, for a long time) in a player management firm that sees the business of some of his current team mates. Moreover, we mustn't forget that it is due to these compulsions that Dhoni deposed before the Mudgal Committee that his colleague and virtual owner of CSK was a mere ""enthusiast"", who recently, in the Lodha Committee verdict, was found guilty and thus suspended for life.  Mukul's screed covered so many other issues. I don't think we have covered even a tiny bit of it."

Yes is a nod. No is left/right. The Head-Bobble is everything in between - when you can't say No but don't want to say Yes (to your boss), when you don't care to have an opinion of Yes or No (""Whatever, dude""), when you want to say ""I understand"", because both Yes or No are for addressing equals, not seniors.

It is not just indian players make money. all top aus,sa,WI,NZ players who play in IPL make money. And hey this money comes from sponsors(read ads) and broadcast rights. I am not saying ads in any given free time in a match is right. there has to be some ads. the article talks as if there are no ads in matches India does not play. may be in other countries or on those true - pay channels in UK and elsewhere. In India ads are more due to greed of star sports, Sony and TEN networks. can't blame bcci for that. biased commentary  in India matches  - have guys never watched/heard  channel 9 commentary- absolutely biased shit (Healy,slater, Nicholas etc) thrown in the recent times.

Cricket,3e1tjv,MuppetCricket,0,Tue Jul 21 17:49:55 2015 UTC,"While I agree with most of the points in this article, I dont understand why he's as harsh on the players. The players have no reason to speak out against the BCCI. For all their adminstrative troubles, the BCCI actually takes very good care of its players, and the Indian team has always been a tightly knit group, that distances itself from outside controversy. I'm perfectly fine with them keeping their mouth shut and not going out of their way to criticize the board. With the amount of competition for spots in India, why would you risk your career for the sake of a few remarks. Leave that to the rest of the world and do what you're supposed to do and play cricket. I agree that it's right to blame the BCCI for being so domineering, but ultimately, they always take care of their players in the form of good facilities, pensions etc. If a player speaks out against the board, it would be like biting the hand that feeds you, and that always leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth, so i don't mind them not speaking out, or for following any rules laid down by the BCCI, as long as they focus on the cricket. As far as commentary goes, I completely agree with everything he has to say.   Also maybe it's just me, but despite all it's administrative troubles and the restriction on commentators, I would much rather watch an India Zimbabwe match than the Ashes, not because I'm not interested in the Ashes, but because I'm much more interested in Indian cricket. The troubles with the board and the lack of quality in commentary hasn't really affected that. At the end of the day cricket is cricket, and India is India.   Keep in mind that this is my point of view as an Indian fan and watcher."

Because ball tampering itself isn't going to give you a win and it is a very common practice.  And strangely the only team you bring up when it comes to ball tampering is SA when there are many others who have been caught."
Cricket,3e1v1a,DanielPutin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:32 2015 UTC,"No, the strange part is that you keep bringing up other teams when I've said nothing of the matter. If you could point me to the part where I've said it's OK for other people to ball tamper, then I'd like to hear it. Or is it just to change the subject to something you'd rather talk about?     If you think that evidence of ball tampering by one person has no effect on the game, then I don't know what sport you think you've been watching, but it's not cricket. Unless you have another theory on why Faf do Plessis (a batsman) decided to tamper with the ball if not to help his team? Getting caught cheating in the both games they last won in the sub continent plus opponent players drawing attention to illegal tactics is plainly a bad sign. If players in days past had it easier to get away with it because of fewer cameras, then how come so few people are getting caught today?"
Cricket,3e1v1a,humanarnold,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"when I've said nothing of the matter.   Exactly  No I just have an issue with you constantly picking out SA for ball tampering and discounting their wins, when your favourite team is one of the most infamous teams historically for ball tampering and has done it many times.  Yet you keep quiet about other teams and act as if their totally innocent. If you want to make noise and discount team's victories because of ball tampering, you better be fair and do it for all countries."
Cricket,3e1v1a,DanielPutin,2,Tue Jul 21 20:01:49 2015 UTC,"So in other words, you had absolutely nothing to be able to defend your argument, but decided to show up and pretend this comment thread was titled ""lel look @ Afridi biting the ball"" of ""OMG BCCI gets Tendulkar off ball tampering charges!!!"" Good to know that you put together such a good defence of why it's OK for South Africa to cheat to win when your only point is ""Pakistan have tampered with the ball.""    Way to stay on topic, and for clarifying that you think it's OK to cheat to win. I, on the other hand, have been pretty consistent that it's not OK to do that.    And about your edit, please show me where this thread was about the history of ball tampering. I thought it was about South Africa's record in the subcontinent. Sounds quite a bit like you're enjoying changing the subject to vent some of your biases, doesn't it?"
Cricket,3e1v1a,humanarnold,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:08:25 2015 UTC,"why would I need to defend that argument when I never even said its ok to carry out ball tampering in the first place.  I just don't like how you try to take SA's victories away from them, and also keep quiet when it comes to other teams.   I, on the other hand, have been pretty consistent that it's not OK to do that.   yup of course when it comes to SA.  But when it comes to other teams and especially my favourite team, I'll be keeping quiet.   Double standards..."
Cricket,3e1v1a,DanielPutin,2,Tue Jul 21 20:13:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you didn't have anything to say, so decided to change the topic to something you'd rather talk about because you don't like it being pointed out that a team you like has been caught cheating twice in 9 months. Double standards: it's OK when a team you like does it, but you're mad when the subject isn't immediately changed. And it sounds like your problem is that this thread wasn't about ball tampering by other teams. If it bothers you so much, why don't you go and make one?     And re-read your comments, you've said several times that ball tampering is no big deal, and doesn't affect the result of the match. Sounds like you're defending it to me.    Yup, I've been completely consistent that ball tampering isn't OK. Still  waiting on you to point out where I said it different. Found it yet? Or is it still firmly located in your imagination?"

I strongly believe his absence was a key factor in the Ashes disaster down here in 2010/11 (not to take anything away from England, they batted brilliantly throughout the tour, but our bowling was also toothless and wayward and would likely have benefitted from his control and reliability)."

Team management called a 'compulsory' team meeting once he was already off fishing and couldn't be reached. Missing an 'optional' training session the same day was used as further evidence of an apparent lack of commitment, and added to a 'string of incidents', some of which were certainly not his fault.

I enjoy his commentating and love watching him play, but if half the things you hear are true, he is a bad ""team"" man.  Winning or losing, there needs to be some principal about the type of player you wish to represent you, even if he is possibly your best player.  I feel the same way about some current young Aussie tennis players. They act like dickheads , I'd rather lose than have those clowns representing my country.   As outsiders, most of us have no clue about the real dynamic he creates, but if his rep is that bad with selectors and possible team members, England is better off without him even if he's the best player they have."
Cricket,3e0nln,sloppyrock,7,Tue Jul 21 06:21:45 2015 UTC,"Really interesting comparison with our current tennis players for sure. For me, the key difference is I'm not convinced either of them right now, should their behaviour warrant a meaningful penalty akin to being dropped (which it probably does at this point) would show half the public or private commitment to earning back their spot that Pietersen has. More so Tomic though, Kyrgios just seems like he really, really needs a break to get his head sorted and see if he actually wants to play tennis for a living. There's a bit of doubt whether he does for mine, whereas Pietersen at least seems genuine and I would have thought the door should have been left open. I'm all for second, third and fourth chances, as long as they're warranted.  I might be way off on this but I would have thought part of the function of the management structure within any sporting body is figuring out how to accommodate 'difficult' but talented sportspeople within a team environment. Both England and Tennis Australia deserve to put under scrutiny for their part in failing in do so, it shouldn't all be on the player(s). You're right though, we're looking in from the outside on both situations, so it's all just opinion.  Yes, he does seem a bit of a knob though, I'm not disputing that at all."

I might be way off on this but I would have thought part of the function of the management structure within any sporting body is figuring out how to accommodate 'difficult' but talented sportspeople within a team environment.   I agree and perhaps they have already? Sad if so.  Whatever the case , it is a shame we won't see him play, but if he is genuinely  a cock , too bad. Then again, maybe it's Cook, Strauss and co. that are the dickheads?"

Cricket,3e0nln,ox_,5,Tue Jul 21 08:32:21 2015 UTC,I think he's past it now. But they clearly dropped him too early.
Cricket,3e0nln,Multidisciplinary,9,Tue Jul 21 05:32:42 2015 UTC,I'd love to see him return and make a pair or something
Cricket,3e0nln,coftsock,3,Tue Jul 21 07:56:16 2015 UTC,"Probably the most likely scenario if he did return; a lot of people still hail him as the messianic saviour of English cricket waiting dutifully in the wings, but the bloke's 35 and hasn't played test cricket in 18 months.   I agree that he's been maltreated by the ECB and should be given the chance to be picked on merit, but even on that basis there's a long list of English batsmen (Bairstow, Hales, Taylor, etc.) ahead of him."
Cricket,3e0nln,SocialistSloth1,0,Tue Jul 21 12:49:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not like he scored 326no back in May."
Cricket,3e0nln,NasusAU,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:17 2015 UTC,Against the worst side in English county cricket that has won once in 2 years; you can appreciate it'd be a bit of a jump back to test cricket?
Cricket,3e0nln,SocialistSloth1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"Sure, but its still 326 runs, not out"
Cricket,3e0nln,ppir,8,Tue Jul 21 17:59:16 2015 UTC,"I genuinely don't think having Pietersen in the test team would do them any good. He hasn't had the form (scoring big against the worst county in England aside), is a suck on morale and too easily gets caught up in sledging with the Australians, which is the last thing England needs at the moment.   Sure the likes of Lyth, Ballance and Bell might be in a rut but is the solution to go back to someone who's more hotheaded and unreliable, not to mention getting on in age?   Of course he's going to milk this for all it's pr worth and the ECB really didn't handle this too well but at the end of the day I still think it was the correct decision."
Cricket,3e0nln,Nixon74,10,Tue Jul 21 06:12:46 2015 UTC,"Although I agree he should be in the team, I don't think this sort of attitude helps his cause at all. Its just justification not to include him."
Cricket,3e0nln,zoinks10,19,Tue Jul 21 03:19:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know - having read through the article and the tweets it seems (unsurprisingly from the Daily Mail) that the headline is far more sensationalist than the tweets. In essence he's backed the experienced guys to pull together, pointed out the obvious that Ballance and Lyth need to score runs (and said he hopes they do) and expressed his disillusionment with not being there to help out.   This stuff is far more conciliatory than his book."
Cricket,3e0nln,ToastySnack111,2,Tue Jul 21 04:23:49 2015 UTC,He never says explicitly who he wants dropped lol. He won't say anything about Bell's batting.
Cricket,3e0nln,zoinks10,2,Tue Jul 21 05:23:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was discussing this with a mate the other day. I'd like to see Hales in as the opener, Root moved to three, KP swapped for Bell at 4 and Ballance at 5 where he won't have to face the new ball. I reckon that would be a good line up to put some fear back into the aussies."
Cricket,3e0nln,Ablimoth,4,Tue Jul 21 05:28:41 2015 UTC,"Root averages 30 less at 3, I don't believe Hales is an opener, KP is probably about equal to Bell right now - he hasn't faced decent bowling in a year or more, Ballance at 5 or 3 doesn't matter really, fundamentally, he's still weak against full, straight balls & gets suckered by a good short ball from a left arm fast bowler.  Cool worries me. Root at 5 is one of the best in the world. Stokes actually plays like he cares and has some talent. Everyone else in the team will make a couple of scores (Ali & Ballance have already made one of theirs, Bell too probably).  On the other hand, Warner can't score in the first innings, Clarke isn't getting any runs right now - especially looks vulnerable to Broad. Haddin is out of touch, Rogers is injured & Voges appears to be struggling - leaving Smith, Warner in the second innings and the tail to score our runs for us.  So really, we should be shout even."
Cricket,3e0nln,zoinks10,2,Tue Jul 21 07:48:34 2015 UTC,"Agree about Root at 3, but his form has been amazing recently whilst at 5 and there's no reason why he can't perform at 3 these days (let's face it, he's coming in about as quickly as a number three normally does anyway, just we are already 3 down).   I think Hales opens in T20 and could be a good attacking option like Warner is for you guys.   I'm also not sure about Ballance but think he might thrive a little lower down the order."
Cricket,3e0nln,NasusAU,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:20 2015 UTC,What batting?
Cricket,3e0nln,Shearer9,5,Tue Jul 21 15:16:26 2015 UTC,Yup. Pretty much.
Cricket,3e0nln,anonbutler,2,Tue Jul 21 03:07:03 2015 UTC,I will never forget the 149 he made against SA and turned the test series on its head. Such a pity that we are not getting to see him bat.
Cricket,3e0nln,Mossley,5,Tue Jul 21 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"God no, leave him out."
Cricket,3e0nln,alsoram,2,Tue Jul 21 05:15:55 2015 UTC,At this point including KP might be one way for the KP hating English supporter to really enjoy the hard work of the Australian Bowling attack.
Cricket,3e0nln,chubbyurma,2,Tue Jul 21 04:11:51 2015 UTC,"listening to the radio the other night, and the commentators said 'KPs probably accepted the fact that the england team have moved on from him'  pfffffffft"
Cricket,3e0nln,f1manoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:18:54 2015 UTC,"There's no doubting the talent but the problem is his attitude sucks. If even half of what is printed is true, it's little wonder the ECB have shut him out.  But I did feel for him slightly when he appeared to be promised at least a chance of selection by returning to the UK, play in the County Championship, make runs and he may be invited to return, then to be flat-out told it would never happen... Yeah, I can understand the bitterness."
Cricket,3e0nln,Clackpot,2,Tue Jul 21 19:05:34 2015 UTC,"Dear old KP, that great uniter of teams - as usual, England are united in their distrust of his enormous ego and blindness to his own failures as a team player.  Like many Brits I'd love to see one last hurrah from KP, and yet I also have not the slightest problem that he's had too many last chances and pissed them all up the wall."
Cricket,3e0nln,badtemperedpeanut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:36:21 2015 UTC,"Bottom line,cricket is just a game. It exists purely to entertain people. If people want KP to play, he should play, after all people pay to run this shit."
Cricket,3e0nln,Iverson1590,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:51:24 2015 UTC,"I would not select him. And i will tell you why.   He needs to spend COMMITTED time at Surrey scoring runs. Sure, he scored 300 early in the season, and then wasn't selected. But as soon as he wasn't selected after that, he stopped playing Championship games for Surrey and started doing the freelance 20/20 bullshit. If he was committed and played an entire championship campaign, scored a shit load of runs, THEN i would pick him. There would be no option but to pick him. But I am not selecting a batsman who hasn't consistently played non-one day cricket. He's not in my test squad if he hasn't played a four day game since April odd."
Cricket,3e0nln,alekksi,3,Tue Jul 21 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"Because he basically was told to fuck off by the ECB. He'd been promised at least a consideration and that was torn from him. He turned down a massive IPL contract to play for Surrey (for free, no less!) and was not in the mood to play for another three months without pay, when he could be on the beach in Miami getting a paycheque from CPL, as he's doing now. There is no such thing as ""no option but to pick him"" in the case of KP. The ECB have drawn their line in the sand and it's extremely unlikely they're going to re-evaluate their position any time soon."
Cricket,3e0nln,daveofreckoning,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"Give it up, big fella. You've pissed on your chips from an international point of view. It's coming across a touch bitter now. If you wanted to play for England, possibly you shouldn't have been texting the South Africans behind your teammates backs. And take piers ""utter twat"" Morgan with you."
Cricket,3e0nln,covmatty1,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:08:52 2015 UTC,"Well then why isn't he proving a point by playing for Surrey and scoring hundreds again? He's sat on a beach in Florida, and James Taylor just scored 291 for Notts...  If he was truly serious about this he'd have gone all out to prove Strauss wrong. If he'd returned from the CPL and just quietly finished the season by scoring more and more runs, he could have held his head high and made an inarguable point, rather than this headline grabbing rubbish."
Cricket,3e0nln,SouareInTheMorning,20,Tue Jul 21 06:10:50 2015 UTC,"He was scoring for Surrey, playing for free. Including 355* in a match where Sanggakara didn't even get 40.  Then the ECB pulled their little stunt and having passed up £250,000 by pulling out of the IPL he went to the Caribbean to earn some of it back.   He's not daft, he knows that while Strauss is around he won't get called up again."
Cricket,3e0nln,sloppyrock,3,Tue Jul 21 06:26:25 2015 UTC,"He's not daft, he knows that while Strauss is around he won't get called up again.   Agreed, he's stirring the pot vigorously."
Cricket,3e0nln,covmatty1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:03:12 2015 UTC,"He was scoring for Surrey.   He got A score. Granted it was a big one, but it was still just one. Bairstow has 5 hundreds for the county champions. I know which one I'd consider more worthy of selection.  And if he isn't daft, well then he should stop whinging and just move on, accept it, and not keep shouting about it on Twitter so he gets headlines written about him as far as I'm concerned."
Cricket,3e0nln,SouareInTheMorning,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:48 2015 UTC,At no point have said to stick him in the team. Bairstow is undeniably ahead of him.   I just think the ECB have handled the matter disgracefully and to exclude him from the possibility of selection on the basis of Strauss' ego is ridiculous.
Cricket,3e0nln,covmatty1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:12 2015 UTC,"I can't argue with that. For the last couple of years of his career I wasn't a big fan of his, he threw away his wicket too easily and didn't / couldn't play for the team, but the way that the content of these ""private"" meetings was in the press within hours of them taking place is a disgrace."
Cricket,3e0nln,Fileefree,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:06:07 2015 UTC,355 against the students XI.   If he knows he won't get a call up then he should shut up and get on with his life. He's like the annoying prick at school who would behave badly so at least people paid attention to him. He knows he's tabloid show pony now and needs to keep up his bleating to remain vaguely relevant.
Cricket,3e0nln,SouareInTheMorning,7,Tue Jul 21 08:35:08 2015 UTC,355 against Leicestershire.  He's a very good player and whilst I don't think he should be in the team he shouldn't be ruled out because Strauss and Cook have put themselves before the team.
Cricket,3e0nln,lionmoose,2,Tue Jul 21 08:38:17 2015 UTC,Leicestershire.   Who have won one game in three years.
Cricket,3e0nln,SouareInTheMorning,6,Tue Jul 21 09:46:22 2015 UTC,Explains all the other triple centuries against them then.
Cricket,3e0nln,lionmoose,3,Tue Jul 21 09:48:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't mean to detract from the fact that the triple was a great achievement and obviously Pietersen has been world class, but I'm not sure that it means he's prepared for international cricket more than he has the ability to flog the weakest side in the second division."
Cricket,3e0nln,SouareInTheMorning,2,Tue Jul 21 09:51:19 2015 UTC,"Like I said, whilst I don't think he should be in the team he shouldn't be ruled out because Strauss and Cook have put themselves before the team."

Cricket,3e19n2,LeopoldvonRanke,8,Tue Jul 21 04:44:58 2015 UTC,SA just needs to play more cricket. I CANNOT WAIT until they tour Australia again.

Cricket,3dy2jg,_rickjames,20,Mon Jul 20 15:24:05 2015 UTC,Ok people lets get a little perspective...its a 5 match series that's currently 1 all. Australia got smashed at Cardiff and bounced back at Lords. Anything could happen from here.    They way these teams are they only thing i feel confident about is that we will get 5 results and thats bloody fantastic.
Cricket,3dy2jg,Rebound86,16,Mon Jul 20 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"Technically you're right, but the difference is Australia's was just a loss like any other loss that can happen. England's loss was a freaking mauling. I don't think it's conceivable for any professional team to perform any worse than England did. It's going to take a heck of a lot of mental character to bounce back from that."
Cricket,3dy2jg,Usmanm11,8,Mon Jul 20 20:39:57 2015 UTC,Not just that but Australia have replaced their weak links with seemingly strong players in Marsh and Nevill. England don't have anything to replace their weak links with except possibly Bairstow fitting in somewhere. Personally I'd swap Lyth for Bairstow and have Root open. Give Bell a final chance at home and hope Ballance finds a bit of form.
Cricket,3dy2jg,rightinthemouth,8,Mon Jul 20 20:49:52 2015 UTC,I would personally love to see root opening. I think he would struggle against the brand new ball.

It's not ODIs, you can't just send your best bat to open, Sachin didn't do it in 2011 in England after us losing like two openers to injury. Opening is a specialized position, like a wicket keeper. Can't just give to a guy cos he fields well at fucking point."

Cricket,3dy2jg,TheBigBadDog,12,Mon Jul 20 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"The whole Australians are cunts thing mostly comes up when they are winning. If they are losing no one cares. So really its just sour grapes, they will try and deny it but the English as well as the kiwis are really quite fragile. At the end of the world cup the kiwis tried to claim some moral victory, its really sad. And the English try and act all morally superior because they don't want to sledge. Instead they openly discuss doctoring pitches, that's a pretty fucken shaky moral high ground they got there."

We can't really determine those until then. Old mate Gary could hit double centuries in every innings and then where would you be?   However, thanks to the English language ('by the end' versus 'at the end'), both of the bet conditions were fulfilled the moment Ballance's average dropped below 50. I believe that moment was his dismissal at Lord's on Friday afternoon."

Cricket,3dxdpg,aaarvark,4,Mon Jul 20 14:03:07 2015 UTC,"Bairstow is averaging over 100 in the CC this year and looks to have corrected his backlift issue. James Taylor, who imo has never got the proper run he deserves in any format for England, scored 291 today and has had a decent season so far. Hales would be a left field test selection, but he has that x factor and capability to dominate teams.   Those would be the three main candidates for me. Personally think Bell should have been dropped by now as well, with Root going up to 3, Taylor 4, Stokes 5 and Hales 6. Or Ali 6 and bring Rashid in. If either proved not to work out then hopefully by then Ballance will rediscover form in the CC and could come in at 5 where he bats for Yorkshire."
Cricket,3dxdpg,Herrrrrrb,2,Mon Jul 20 19:51:27 2015 UTC,"Hales had a good start oft the season at number three, Compton would proably be able to stick around longer than Ballance. Other options are Stoneman who plays as an opener for Durham, Borthwick who bats at number three and does it okayish, Hildreth in Somerset who's been good but is old. There are more that have been good but not great.  What they could do is to move Bell and Root up the order and have Bairstow in at 6, a guy who's probably in the form of his life."
Cricket,3dxdpg,Eichizen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:44:47 2015 UTC,Compton had a run opening and it didn't quite work out. Perhaps a little unfairly given opportunities that others have had.
