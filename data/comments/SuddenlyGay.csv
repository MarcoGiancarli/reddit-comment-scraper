SuddenlyGay,345976,Plethorgalg,26,Tue Apr 28 17:59:41 2015 UTC,This is a great article detailing how a culture of homophobia has impacted heterosexual males by making it less acceptable to embrace platonic touch.

Collegiate wrestling emerged from the folk wrestling styles practiced in the early history of the United States. This style, with some slight modifications, is also practiced at the high school and middle school levels, and also among younger participants, where it is known as scholastic wrestling. These names help distinguish collegiate wrestling from other styles of wrestling that are practiced around the world such as those in the Olympic Games: freestyle wrestling and Greco-Roman wrestling.

SuddenlyGay,2pmlba,JustZisGuy,3,Thu Dec 18 23:39:26 2014 UTC,I can understand that. My first intro to hockey was during the 97 season and I have so much nostalgia for that roster.

SuddenlyGay,2pl1m0,Vilavek,101,Wed Dec 17 21:11:57 2014 UTC,I can't possibly fathom why he'd do this.
SuddenlyGay,2pl1m0,iShinga,177,Wed Dec 17 17:25:50 2014 UTC,I would assume that's the team doctor and he is probably seeing if the player can sense a light touch due to a blow to the head or possible neck or back injury...or he's reminiscing about their previous night.
SuddenlyGay,2pl1m0,tpschi,29,Wed Dec 17 17:37:44 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like he said ""feel that"" and the player said he does."
SuddenlyGay,2pl1m0,Proxystarkilla,16,Wed Dec 17 19:58:31 2014 UTC,"His lips read something close to ""can you feel that on your arm?"" and then the player nods."
SuddenlyGay,2pl1m0,whats8,5,Thu Dec 18 05:24:05 2014 UTC,"Team dr looks like is saying ""you fingers are going numb?"" And the dude nods. Or he could have said ""can you feel this on your arm?"""
