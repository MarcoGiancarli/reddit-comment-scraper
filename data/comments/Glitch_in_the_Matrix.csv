For a while, everything becomes about you and your latest theory. But it's just a phase and it passes.  If it continues for too long though, then a pause for thought may be required: We need to realise that our minds tend to ""discover"" evidence for whatever our Theory Of Today happens to be. Synchronicity = don't believe your own thoughts.[1]  So maybe keep an eye on this. For the purpose of this topic, there are no higher powers or creators beyond aspects of ourselves.  [1] There's a good interview on synchronicity with clinical psychologist Kirby Surprise that you might find of interest. He gives some good examples of how obsession plus synchronicity (which is basically a reflection of your own mind-state) can lead some people into feedback-loops of paranoia and so on, and how to get out of it. He also goes into various theories which you can take or leave, so: Jump to 35:05 for a particularly relevant section."

I don't know what stuff he's into, but if he's into ""reality"" stuff and a bit of an obsessive character, maybe you can encourage him to ditch that boring being-controlled stuff (yawn!) and get into experimenting with synchronicity instead! :-)   (The book that's mentioned in that interview has some experiments; they're quite fun to play with.)  Generally, I'd say don't try to ""discuss him out of it"" by engaging with his ideas; try to redirect him instead to other fun stuff. Easier said than done I'm sure. If it continues on though, then do consider asking others for help. You can't take responsibility yourself for this sort of thing.  One day hopefully he should be asking: Is this fun? No?

We argue about it and he ends up making solid logical arguments, that make me end up not believing in it.   A year later the same thing happens to him, and now 6 months later here we are.

We can be such hypocrites like that! ;-)  Oh and I found a text interview just to be able to point out relevant part. Here's a heavily edited snippet to give you the flavour:   SC:  You also say that synchronistic events can be very seductive, that they can tell you exactly what you most want to hear. Can you give us some specific examples?  KS: Let’s go back to one of the clients I had who had been labeled as paranoid schizophrenic. I first met him in his 50s. When he was in his 20s, he saw a synchronistic event (SE) and wondered, “How is that possible,” and the only explanation he had was, “It’s God.” What happened then was he figured, “Why would God be talking to me? I must have a special purpose in the world.” Everyone actually has this sort of thread in them, somewhere, of wanting to be the Messiah. We want to essentially be parents to the universe. We want to help. We want to make things better, and it would be wonderful to think that we were God’s chosen special child. That desire, that sort of psychodynamic want to please the parent is innate in all of us.  This client projected that outwards, and what it came back as was, “Yes. You are one of my chosen Messiah, people, whatever.” He spent the next several decades lost in SE about his special mission from God.” It is very seductive, because if you want to play that mythology, you see it projected externally and it comes back to you as synchronistic events. It is a story that we tell ourselves, and people have many stories that they are seduced by.   If you realize that you have the choice about what patterns you create, you can look for the stories that you want to be involved in. What I am trying to do is give people back that choice.   Good luck!"

I had purchased two bottles of apple cider vinegar; one generic store brand and other organic.  When i returned home I placed one above the stove and I recall plaxing the other on the kitchen table.  Later that evening I went to grab the organic vinegar use and it was nowhere to be found.  I searched the kitche, cupboards, refrigerator, freezer pantry, dinning area, etc., all to no avil.  I gave up searching after about 20 minutes figuring I had moved it or that someone else in mh house did.  Fast forward to Sunday evening and I am cooking ribs on the barbeque.  My oldest daugter calls me in from the deck and said she found the cider vinegar, when i ask where she points to the very top of the cupboards where the bottle is sitting partially inside a large white flower vase.  I thought one of my kids did it to be funny but I am not certain of it beacuse at 6'1 even I would require a small step ladder to reach up that high and of the kids at home the tallest is 5'4.

OP himself seems pretty convinced. Could be a minor brain twitch or anything though. Basically, we'll never know.

Which makes duplicate combos more common than people think.  I know when I was in high school, the primitive combo locks on our lockers were pretty easy to open if you knew ""the trick""; and by ""trick"" I mean the mathematical formula (or something) that made up the combinations*.  *I was never able to do this because I don't math so good, but some of my friends knew how and exploited it for fun and deviousness."

Also it seems the numbers follow a pattern and can't be too close together.   If the link is correct, there are 80 possible combinations for each starting number, so 40 starting numbers would mean 3200 possible combinations."

My thought was that perhaps the company only only has like 5 different combinations they use to make things cheaper and so the odds are higher.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3dyinw,Hysterymystery,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"It was pre-set. Every lock I've bought in the last ten years has had the number digitally printed on a little booklet on the back; the ink for the number is different than the ink for the rest of the booklet, which leads me to believe that it's a variable printing method like inkjet. That would probably only be necessary if there were a large number of potential permutations, otherwise it would be more efficient to do a single-pass print with plates."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3dyinw,DiamineRose,4,Mon Jul 20 21:08:06 2015 UTC,"Even still, I'm wondering if they had just a handful of lock combinations they use instead of just one combination for each lock. Like, this batch of 10,000 locks uses 12-42-23, the next batch uses 19-35-24. Maybe they have a system where they mix them up so a box that goes to a store has locks from different batches or maybe they just box up locks from the same combination batch, and sent a box of locks from the same batch to the local walmart where you and other random dude both shop. I have no knowledge of how lock manufacturing works, but to me that seems like a reasonable explanation."

In other words, it is not really a ""spatially-extended world, unfolding in time"". Space and time are aspects of experiencing rather than aspects of the world; they are more like ""base formatting"" of the human mind. The room next door is not actually ""over there"".  The world then becomes more like a collection of ""dimensionless facts"" dissolved into the background of experience; a superposition of implicit patterns which can be unfolded into sensory form with attention.

Which means that the ""Embryo"" in the story is the same consciousness (from a different perspective) as the ""Parents"" in the story.  There exists a perspectival experience of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter exactly as it is written for every character in the books. And there are perspectival experiences of everything Rowling could have chosen to write, but didn't. And everything that could never be written in, because we don't have sufficient language for it.  Some monkey has the experience of typing out the full works of Shakespeare on a typewriter, and, in at least one perspective, understands the significance of that.  -=-=-  That's all I mean by limiting. The story does a great job of acquainting a reader with the idea that we're all in this together as a species, which is a beautiful thing. I just like to take it a step further, and believe that we're all in this together as a cosmos/universe/Everything. :)"

But the way the Pantheists tend to believe is that there is still nothing except what we see, and that that what we see is God. That's extremely limiting, in my perspective.   I believe that not only is every perspective perceived by ""The One Consciousness"" (For which my personal noun is ""God,"" because it's as good as any other), but that every possible consciousness that could ever exist does exist.   Somewhere out there, there's an experiential perspective of ""The God of Israel"" Leading the Isrealites through the desert, parting seas and getting frustrated. And somewhere out there, there's an experiential perspective Buzz Lightyear landing in Andy's Room and causing trouble for Woody and the Gang. All possible experiences: One cosnciousness.  -=-=-  In other terms, people could see this to be a form of Solipsism. But, solipsism is the belief that the self is the only being that can be proven to exist. While the notion is true depending on your definition of ""proof,"" This is far greater than that. It is the belief in a certain interconnectedness at an experiential level that defies proving, and, in fact (at least from my perspective) does not seek a proof.  -=-=-  I'm interested to hear any thoughts on this matter. :)"

Go back to the etymology of the word - If Pantheism is what you say, then it shouldn't be defined by the senses alone because that's exclusionary, otherwise the word ""pan"" shouldn't be there. Make an example of yourself and be the kind of Pantheist that goes outside the five senses."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3ds7fx,REM_ember,2,Sun Jul 19 15:32:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. And, as I said, that's just (from my perspective) an observed pantheistic tendency.   I agree entirely.

Quantum states are within sets and states cannot refer outside of themselves to affect the set. Therefore there is no quantum state which says there are no other quantum states.  Of course, it's just a description anyway, a connective fiction based on abstractions. Really, multiverses are a rubbish interpretation  that arises from assuming that probabilities are objectively real rather than useful calculation schemes. I'd say QBism for the win for sure! ;-) [1]  However, the way it (MWI) is set up on its own terms, there no paradox by definition.  [1] Well, maybe - it doesn't handle overlap of views very well."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3dtb88,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sun Jul 19 07:22:31 2015 UTC,"This is the same as Russell's paradox in mathematics.  It goes like this ""Let R be the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as as a subset.  Then if R does not contain itself as a subset, then it must, by definition, contain itself as a subset which then means it cannot contain itself as a subset.""  The problem with this formulation is the naive assumption that we can have a ""set of all sets"".   In a more concrete example, we have the barber paradox ""The barber shaves all men to who do not shave themselves, then who shaves the barber?""  What underlies both of these paradoxes is the fundamental result of the Godel incompleteness theorem. Basically it concludes that system of logic cannot be both complete and consistent.  By consistent, we mean that each statement that can be proven cannot have a negation that is also provable true.  Completeness means that there are no unprovable statements in our collection of statements.  Now comes the problem of the statement ""This statement has no proof."" If we want to maintain completeness, then we have to allow this inconsistent statement, but if we want to maintain consistency, we have to not allow this statement and toss out completeness.   No system can be both consistent AND complete.   So looking back at the original statement the OP is proposing looking at ""the set of all possible universes including universes that have no parallel universes. Some observations.   Does not the set of all possible universes those that arose by a branching from a quantum event (if a quantum event A occurs to create parallel universes uni-A and Uni-not-A, then we have parallel universes) imply that every universe must have at least one possible parallel.  So if we have a universe that has no parallel universes, it could not be a part of this collection by definition since EVERY quantum event in that universe would be one alternative in a binary possibility so the other possibility also exists. The number of possible universes may be quite larger than the collection of universes that arise by quantum branching.  Just like the real numbers are more infinite than the rational numbers.  What is the scope of ""parallel?""  If we have a universe A in which every quantum event q that did occur did NOT occur in a universe not-A, are they parallel?  Part of the problem may be that we have no accurate definition of parallel."

Because the thoughts wouldn't exist. So a paradox can only exist if perhaps the majority of the population (if we are consciousness) think or more important believe (with emotion), in it.   Likewise that's also doublethink which orwell wrote about and in my brain I can accept contradiction. We all care and that means that it's not an issue. There is no truth in this instance. Maybe we create the truth. We are not about to find out anytime soon and so perhaps a paradox is an illusion of the mind. Just like knowledge is stored in the mind - yet when people learn piano and get stuck on a piece..what do people recommend? Walking away. Why? Cause the brain sorts it out for you. From experience. Question: How does the brain know what you intended to play when you couldn't play it?   So a paradox is really a mental block that we must over come"

Is it possible that the key dropped onto the countertop when you tried to grab something from a shelf or a cabinet/cupboard. The newly discovered key looks old. It could've been there for a long time. The previous owner may have misplaced them there. Your key could be a copy. Or there could be some agents in your building."

As for the snapchat, you say the buzzing sound of your phone woke you up. That means it started while you were sleeping, so you most likely just included it in your dream and it just so happened that your brain got it right. I also don't see why she wouldn't have access to a phone as you state in your title, it just feels like you're trying to make it weirder than it actually is.  And lastly, dreaming about someone posting topless photos and having someone else posting topless photos the next day doesn't sound any special to me. The hashtag was probably popular at the time which could explain you dreaming about it, and having one person using it the following day isn't unlikely. I'd be more concerned if your cousin actually posted topless pictures that day."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3drhgg,YipYapYoup,0,Sat Jul 18 20:40:16 2015 UTC,"I had never heard of such a hashtag or even such a movement about free the nipple. It started the next day as far as I know. What does it matter who it was in the dream? It wasn't necessarily my cousin. I just thought it was. It didn't even look like her or anything, it just ""was"" her. How would I know that a non-pornographic person would post topless photos with no pornographic intention and a political hashtag along with it? It's a 1-2-3.   How could I ""feel like I could"" describe a dream before the thing actually happens when in fact I have described before?   These are dreams that happened weeks or months before I actually experience them sometimes, and I remember them distinctly, think about them, and talk about them.   As for the girl, she was not allowed to have a phone at camp, we didn't communicate for a month, I'm not sure why you had to be snotty about that?   The buzz of a notification is not a long buzz like a cell phone ringer. It's instant, and the snapchat did not happen in the dream right before I woke up. A lot of other stuff happened after.   Even if I dreamt about getting a snapchat from her right before waking up, there would still be no way of me knowing that there would actually be one. I did not see it with my eyes until I woke up, open my eyes, and picked up my phone, which sits well above eye level.   Your comment came off as ridiculing me for the way I told my story, which was 100% faithful and with distinct memory. Yes, there are all kinds of psychological explanations for déjà vu but my experiences do not match the standard that you have described that I am well aware of.   In fucking Iceland with my parents, we went to some tiny art museum. Not even touristy or well known internationally. I had a dream the week before about walking through some room with big wood cubes in the room. In my dream, I walked around the cube to the other side, and saw a pedestal with a small wooden house thing on it. When we walked into the room, I said I recognized it, and recalled walking around it and seeing the house on the other side.   We walked around, and there was a house. In another room in that museum, I remembered seeing some little volcano science fair project looking thing around the corner. It was there. They're not something I see a lot, but since like elementary school.   Say there's gotta be an explanation all you want, but don't call me a liar/say I'm describing the story wrong just to fit your lame cookie cutter glitch in the matrix explanation response."

Also:   How could I ""feel like I could"" describe a dream before the thing actually happens when in fact I have described before?   What are you even talking about? No where do you mention a dream in this part I was replying to :   I also occasionally have déjà vu conversations or events that I could describe/say word for word or step by step before they happen (not just in the moment it seems like ""this seems weirdly familiar"")   I also didn't call you a liar, I just found it weird how your title mentionned the girl having no access to a phone when it seemingly had no impact in your actual story."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3drhgg,ChurchBrimmer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:06:03 2015 UTC,"To me it seems like you're trying too hard to ""be psychic"" and the worst part is you already said why yourself. You want to feel special. Then you posted here and someone told you you're not special and that upset you. Weird shit happens, and déjà vu is not exempt. We've all experienced it. Hell I experienced it while typing this, but this isn't an uncommon style of comment for me to make and since dreams are mostly your subconsious trying to make sense of all of the sensory data that your brain has taken in it makes sense that déjà vu happens.   You may not consiously remember seeing the hashtag but you might have seen it and then it got included in your dream. Remember the human mind is the greatest recording device ever created. It takes in every color, sound, smell, taste, everything you touch from the moment you're born until you die. You may not be able to conciously access this but it is there. So when you look at it in that way you might have seen something like that in some way shape or form and then your subconsious added it in while you were dreaming.   As for the snapchat, it sounds like getting snapchats from this person are not uncommon for you so to dream of getting one from her (especially if she had been on your mind) is not that strange. The fact that you got woken up by a snapchat from this person is nothing more than a coincidence."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3drhgg,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:17:20 2015 UTC,"Weird shit happens   I have to say, though, that ""weird shit happens"" isn't a great explanation for things. ;-)  And as soon as we go into ""dreams are you making sense of stuff"" or ""you might have seen it and included it"" territory we're just fantasising because, despite what popular science articles might lead us to believe, we really have no idea what sleep and dreams are. It sounds like an explanation, but when we ask: how, exactly? we find it's got no content.  A nice approx quote (which I will try and find my reference for) from a researcher: ""After 30 years of study, the only definite conclusion I can draw is that: dreaming is a thing that happens when we go to sleep"".  Not saying OP is particularly ""psychic"" but I don't think much of the ""explanations"" we offer for these things either!  I kinda think we're in an ""interesting, we don't know yet"" region."

It's become my term for the longer ""weird shit happens but jumping to wild conclusions with no evidence is not how you find answers."" The people who I say it to that are intelligent enough to figure that part out on their own are worth the time of the conversation. The others are only worth it as long as they remain entertaining.   While we may not have an exact idea of how it works at least there is more, and more credible, evidence to back up my explanation. My main point is that most of it however is coincidence and, as I said previously, OP has created an explanation that has him as a psychic because it makes him feel special (he admited as much in the post). So anytime a strange dream coincidence (that we've all had happens) he finds some way to make it fit this explanation."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3drhgg,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:37:37 2015 UTC,"Nice. Basically, this story = literally coincidence. Which isn't us being dismissive, it's just actually what happened. I agree OP is ""building his part"" a bit.  These sorts of experiences are pretty common though, beyond déjà vu. I think events do have a habit of lining up or clustering in a way that seems to be beyond simply pattern selection.[1] They are not easy to explain in terms of ""the subconscious doing things"" beyond the most hand-waving way. (What is the subconscious anyway? In what way does it ""do"" anything?) If we can't say how, exactly then it's more of an explaining-away than an explanation.  ""Weird shit happens"" may indeed be the most accurate accounting so far. (I won't deny OP's hankering to feel special though. Isn't that what we all want?)  [1] 3D pattern selection anyway, if we don't mind a bit of metaphysics we could account for it in terms of 4D pattern selection."

Long story short this same thing has happened to me many times. Happened since I was a kid. I think your brain is like an antenna in a way. It somehow picks up cell phone signals. Maybe... I don't know. All I know is this has happened to me before too. I have dreamed about things that come true but it specifically has happened where it involves a cell phone a few times.   One example was one morning when I was sleeping I dreamt my sister texted me at a specific time. Then the dream shifted to me carrying a black bag in my mouth like a dog and I was bringing it to her. I wake up after a bit more dreaming, roll over and check my phone (on silent). I see that I had gotten a text from my sister at the same time that dreamt I had gotten a text from her. She was asking me to bring her over her black lunch bag before she left for work.  I'll clarify a few crucial things because as a skeptic I see all the holes in claims like these but again I'm not gonna type up a giant essay because I'm tired right now and am not feeling up to eliminating maximum doubt... I'll eliminate some doubt though:  1.) I didn't even know my sister used a lunch bag or had a lunch bag let alone getting the correct color in my dream. 2.) She is very independent and mainly lived at my mom's house at the time and I mainly lived at my dad's. So it's extremely rare for her to have something she needed from my dad's place. 3.) Also given that shes independent its extremely rare that she asks me to bring stuff over to her. Especially since my dad's place is a 5 min walk from my mom's so if she did ever need something she could easily get it herself (this particular morning she was apparently running late and needed me to save her a few minutes)  Anyways usually when I dream of something that later comes true I usually chalk it up to my subconscious picking up on patterns but in the case like this one, there were no patterns to draw from. It was an isolated case for my sister to request the delivery of an item let alone an item I didn't even know she had. It explains why in my dream it was just a vague ""black bag"" because a specific lunch bag didn't exist in my perspective of reality. On top of that the time which I dreamed getting a text matched up to the time I actually received the text."

The nature of reality is a complex thing - not because it is but because we're in a world full of liars. So my advice, is to find the solution within yourself. Doctors would call you crazy and most people would try to give you advise on something that's never happened to them.   Maybe keep a diary and try to put down as much information and detail as possible. Look for patterns. Ask yourself questions. Find out about yourself. No one will ever know you better then you. You want the truth? It's within you."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3dlfd4,CleverGirl2014,5,Sat Jul 18 17:20:13 2015 UTC,"What a fascinating experience. I have a few questions if you don't mind.  Were your new friends dressed in a contemporary fashion that you recognized, or did they and others around you appear to be dressed differently than expected?   You say that you were in this altered state for approximately a half hour and made it back to your dorm - Were you guided there by your friends or were you on your own at that point? was your room the same as before, or was it changed? Once in your dorm were you able to view yourself in a mirror at any time to confirm your appearance?   When you ""woke up"" back by the gym, were your friends Evan and Taylor there? Had no time passed, or was it a half hour later?  And lastly, you say that being 'Jessica' felt more real than being 'stepahanie' - can you elaborate on why you felt that way?   Thanks for your responses!"

And my friends were with me because they lived in the same dorm.  I didn't see any mirrors When I came to by the gym it had been a half hour of me being ""gone"" but in my dream state or dissociation it was like 5 minutes.  And when he called me Jessica... You ever go some place and it feels like home? Or someone calls you a name that isn't yours or a nickname and it just feels right? He called me Jessica and it was like that's who I was, I was a different person, not Stephanie anymore."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3dlfd4,TriumphantGeorge,2,Fri Jul 17 18:54:49 2015 UTC,Hmmm...interesting. Was there anyone who witnessed you just standing by the gym for half an hour unresponsive staring off into space? I assume that your friends just wandered off without you....

And I quickly passed out of consciousness [ . . . ]  I took a step back and looked at the monitors on these two identical gaming rigs. They were easily 36"" diagonally each, but the peculiar thing about them was that they had a 4:3 aspect ratio instead of the 16:9 widescreen we're used to.  We booted the machines up, and played a little bit of this 3rd-person jetpack flying game. I realized that sitting close to these monitors, they took up most of my field of view, yet the pixel density was incredibly crisp, and the refresh rate was really good.  ""These are quite the monitors! Sitting close to them, it feels almost as immersive as VR."" I commented to Jim.  ""Eh, yeah, they'll do in a pinch. But they're still no Enviroview.""

We had a promotion going on for people from Europe to call us on.  One of those that called lived in a town [quite a small town] where my brother lives and I told him so.  He then asked what my brother's name was [I know it seems unprofessional but we had a good chat and I told him], only for him to say that he not only knows him but that they had lunch together yesterday.  I later called and asked my brother if he knew this person and he confirmed.  Also my husband had just bought a car [a few years back] but didn't get the MOT cert. for it. A few days later, he is driving in front of a car that is flashing its lights in a different town to where he bought it from. He stops and a woman tells him that she has his MOT cert in her car as she recognised the number plate and handed it to him.   When he asked if she knew the seller, she didn't, she said she just had this cert in her car for ages and didn't know where it belonged to.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3djhby,xXIJDIXx,2,Fri Jul 17 04:24:53 2015 UTC,Nope not by phone number. They had to enter their account number for any info to come up. The reasoning being I guess that people can be borrowing other people's cell phones so it's not a reliable way to do it.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3dhhap,beanoz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:38 2015 UTC,"There's an awesome book called On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins about what intelligence really is and how it works.  His theory is that our brains, specifically the neocortex, are pattern recognition machines giving us our ability to perceive patterns and make sense of them.  When you drive by mundane things everyday on your way to work, you don't notice them... but when you're in a new place with mundane things, everything is stimulating.  The proposed reason behind this... is your brain already identifies the pattern and tells you not to focus your attention on it.  You only focus on what's new.  After you've defocused your attention on something for so long, you lose the wonder in it.  For example... look at your keyboard.  Like really, look at it.  Look at the texture, the curves and edges, and imagine all the circuitry underneath the keys and how they function.  Make it your sole focus without thinking into the past or the future.  It's weird.  Personally, I find this attentiveness to the present despite pre-recognized patterns to be the basis of living in the now, which is the root psychedelic and spiritual experiences."

I'm sure every one on here wants to hear a rational explanation, but because it's possible the lady got it fixed, doesn't mean it's plausible. if she got it fixed she wouldn't put it on the floor she had just vacuumed. I highly doubt she would take a gold bracelet from the place of her work, broken or not, and pay herself to get it fixed and not say a word and just drop it on the ground after vacuuming.

My brother has blond hair and his cat is black (point will come later). My brother and his gf went to the vet and the cat got fixed up. The next evening my mom was on the phone with my brother and before he got to tell her about the accident with the cat, my mom told him that she had a dream about him. She said that she dreamt he had injured his eye, but suddenly it was as if it wasn't really him because in the dream his hair was black. This kinda freaked us out as well."

Perhaps the one you hit did land in the spot you said and got lost in the grass/taken by the wildlife/whatever and the one you found was someone elses ball of the same brand. Longshot, but maybe?   Also, did you watch your ball the whole way through the air? Or just hit it and watch the green waiting for it to land? How close are the surrounding holes? Maybe someone hit a bad shot onto your green at the same time and you saw that ball land, which the person retrieved as you were walking to the green. Then you found your actual ball in the spot it actually landed."

At the time I was using light green.  Definitely not a common choice by any means (if you've ever used this color ball you'd know why; it's a total bitch to find in long rough on a course with green grass).    I, indeed, watched it off the tee all the way down to where it landed.  The green for this hole was sort of on the corner of the course, and the closest thing to it was the next hole's tee box, which faced away from our green.  Not to mention there wasn't anybody within two holes of us either way."

Someone could have moved it but think about it. Do you see much wildlife there? Statistically for it to be wildlife? Well that would be a coincidence.   So do an experiment. Get a pair of binoculars and use them. Don't say anything to your mate. Let him use his/her eyes and you the binoculars and see if you can repeat what happened. Once you see the ball (if you can) - even take some video or a picture so you have proof and then you don't have to look at it all the time but experiment with it.   Who knows what you'll find :)

My SO and I were just out, cruising, my little hometown where we grew up.  It's a small place, for sure, and it would take you maybe four minutes to cross it.  Keep in mind, we were just driving, so we were just cruising down an almost abandoned stretch of highway, technically part of a larger state route, but it had a business branch that had been officially routed through the main street of town before I was born.  Just a nice, neatly paved place that no one visits at night, you know?  Skirted the outside of town.  Didn't run into any traffic, so there's no explanation.  Well, we're on our way back, and we get to talking.  We're thinking of hitting a drive-thru and getting some drinks once we get back in town, so I check the time.  It's 10:01, the place he's thinking of is open for another 30 minutes, so all good, right?  I remember we passed a house that had a large family and a bonfire outside, fun sight. :) Then I looked back at the clock.  We'd barely moved a few inches, and the clock said 10:12.  If we'd been driving 10 minutes, we'd be well out of town on the other side and heading towards one of the old mining towns.  Still no explanation for that..."

Missing Time Colleen - Omaha, Nebraska  I've had more than a few interesting things happen in my life. I'm sure most other people have too, but they often either turn away and fail to recognize them, or are so frightened that they aren't curious. I'm frightened sometimes too, but mostly I'm curious.   When I was 17, I had a ""missing time"" episode. I lost the better share of a whole day! I can tell you the day had been perfectly normal up to that point. Then it was just over! When it had just been late morning, suddenly it was late evening. My friends that I was with that day all had the same strange sensation. One of them refused to talk about it, but two of them said that they acted just as if was perfectly normal for the day to be over, when we knew it wasn't. Ten hours of that day just vanished. And very few people mentioned it.   This incident has bothered me for 24 years. It's very strange the way some people reacted to that incident, too. My friends and I were all in a large city park that day. There were people all around us, and yet everyone seemed to accept the end of the day as if it were normal! I did, too, for the most part. The difference in my experience was that I had plans with my family that I was looking forward to that evening. My parents and I didn't get to do what we had wanted to do that evening, and when I asked my mom about it, she put a whole new light on things. She said, ""Sometimes things just change."" She was very attuned to such things, and swore that there were reality shifts, she just didn't call them that. But sometimes she would say things like ""Well, it's different, now"". When things weren't where they belonged or when time messed up, she accepted it because ""Well, it's different, now"". This didn't happen all the time, but it happened in her life quite frequently, or perhaps she was just more attuned to the changes. I must say some of these things still bother me. I'm not quite as accepting as my mother was.  Granted it's easy enough to say that these things didn't really happen, that when I was 17, I just lost track of the time while hanging out with my friends. But I know that is not what happened. Several other people besides me had the same experience that day, and I can't ignore the fact that my family didn't get to do what we'd planned for that evening.  -- Your Stories Page 26, Realityshifters.com"

Is that where we're eventually headed?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3dd0iz,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:41:41 2015 UTC,"(Going with this) What's more curious is that ""obviously"" the whole world didn't skip time that day, otherwise there'd be more than this person's story - but other people did apparently share the experience. So it would seem that talking of a single shared ""reality"", with one defined set of facts, isn't a good description. Is it more like a collection of overlapping perspectives?  Marcus Arvan's P2P network model in philosophy and the recent QBism interpretations in quantum physics both point to a ""private view"" of some sort, or more specifically a ""private view + interactions"".[1][2][3]  This is interesting. What is also interesting is that the ""interactions"" are inferred and if you ponder it a bit more, it's not clear how you handle the potential for the view itself to filter which interactions (and hence which contributing observations) enter the private view and become part of the accumulation of facts.  Notes:  [1] The notion of ""the Now"" or ongoing wavefunction in that QBism paper (the more rigorous version of which can be downloaded here) is what I've been calling a ""world-pattern"". This corresponds to the accumulation of all observations to date, comprising a world state. However, I don't agree that ""the Nows"" of private views need to be simultaneous. In fact, I don't see how this can be, since ""the Nows"" do not actually unfold in time. The way in which they interact or overlap is in the sense of having access to a common resource of patterned information, rather than in the sense of ""happening"" together. Furthermore, there is no difference between apparently internal and external observations: they both arise in the same experiential space and amount to the recalling of patterns into the private view, modifying the world-pattern. All pattern activations change the state of the world-pattern and influence subsequent observations.  [2] N. David Mermin, the author of that QBism piece, also has this other Nature article on distinguishing between reality and abstraction, and our tendency to reify our concepts if they are successful. Pertinent and worth reading.   [3] There's another good article on QBism in Quanta magazine with an interview with Christopher Fuchs. Worth browsing through the reader comments also."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3d5m32,mrsbutterz,13,Mon Jul 13 18:33:18 2015 UTC,This kind of thing has happened twice to me. Once when I rolled my ankle. And once when I smashed my wrist. I think it's apart of a autonomic response to the injury. I had flashes of colors and changes of textures as well as weird proprioception.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3d5m32,NurseSati,6,Tue Jul 14 03:38:01 2015 UTC,"When I'm laying in bed, nearly asleep, and I hear a loud noise, I usually see a flash of some random noise ""pattern"" at the same time. A circular pattern made from static. It's like my eyes (or visual cortex) being woken up with a start and going hey whoa what was that?  No doubt you can have similar visual distortions in other situations of sudden startling/stressful/painful stimulus such as twisting your ankle. Especially if you had damaged tendons there before, there would be a brief flash of severe pain (due to briefly pinching the nerves) that could cause a similar flash of panic in the brain, that might distort other sensory input, e.g. interfering with your perception of colour. (It might even be a deliberate response, quickly shutting down some parts of the brain in order to prioritize the parts that deal with escaping from a threat.) This might all last for a tiny fraction of a second before the nerve stops being pinched or the brain makes sense of the sudden surge and adjusts so that it's not interfering with the rest of your senses. Hence an extremely brief moment of altered perception before things stabilize and you realize what just happened."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3d5m32,RenaKunisaki,3,Tue Jul 14 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"I see the same patterns just like you do, how weird is it that your brain decides the sound now has a visual aspect to it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3d5m32,Vigilantius,2,Wed Jul 15 19:15:25 2015 UTC,"I guess it's the sudden jolt of sensory input causing a few misfires.  Alternatively perhaps it is ""static"". You might see with some electronics, when first powered on or reset there might be a brief flash of static on the screen. That happens if the screen is turned on (or remained on) before the video memory is initialized. (Volatile memory contains random-ish data at power on and must be cleared to a known state.) Usually you don't see this because they initialize the video memory before turning the screen on, but if it crashed or the firmware is buggy or the screen can't be turned off by software, you can see the brief flash of whatever the initial contents of memory are (usually random nonsense, but could be fragments of the last image it showed).  Maybe that's what causes these flashes of static in our vision, too. Normally the visual cortex powers up before our consciousness does (so we don't notice the initial random junk - the ""screen"" is off) and stays on as long as we're awake. But in that brief moment as we're falling asleep, perhaps there are cases where the visual cortex shuts down before the consciousness does. You don't notice, because you go from seeing nothing (visual cortex reports nothing because there's nothing to report) to still seeing nothing (visual cortex reports nothing because it's off).  You ordinarily would never notice, but a loud noise during that brief period can trigger a minor panic response (startle you) where the brain goes hey, what was that? Possible threat detected, prepare to engage... the visual cortex turns back on (gonna need that to identify the threat and deal with it if there is one) but your consciousness is already awake (""screen"" is still on), so you see that brief flash of static before it's initialized itself. (And of course you see patterns in it, because the brain is a giant pattern matching machine, identifying any possible pattern even when there aren't any.)"

It is sometimes referred to by martial arts instructors and self-defense experts as the Tachy Psyche effect. For someone affected by tachypsychia, time perceived by the individual either lengthens, making events appear to slow down, or contracts, objects appearing as moving in a speeding blur. It is believed that tachypsychia is induced by a combination of high levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, usually during periods of great physical stress and/or in violent confrontation.

We were swimming in a lake that connected to other lakes. So lots of boat activity. We went into a smaller Lake of the chain and swam around in our life jackets. A big boat came through and circled us a few times and made ridiculously huge checkered pattern waves then left. We were having so much fun being tossed up and down by the patterned waves. Then my friend and I went up really high then down really low. Instead of coming back up for the next wave, it blindsided us and we both went through the wave. This next part is hard to explain but... Time is linear (usually) and if I laid it out on a time line it was probably like 3-6 seconds that we were trapped inside this wave. It felt like 10-15 seconds. Like time slowed down and I could actually breathe underwater. It was the weirdest and coolest thing I've ever experienced.

Adult's can't do this because we ""know"" that it's physically impossible and dangerous.  ADDENDUM: I did a little reading on this. Apparently we can't extract enough oxygen from water for continued breathing...however, oxygen is just one side of the coin. Toxic carbon dioxide buildup actually occurs sooner than oxygen deprivation. I wonder if the kids were using the water as a CO2 scrubber allowing them more time underwater.

I have no doubt that a good deal of stories on here are made up, others are explainable and others are misconceptions.  I am mostly interested in the few that I believe are true and can be explained [via QM], dismissing them all will result in actually very interesting shifts in time/space being ignored.

If that were the case I'd actually put both rings in a container and try to contact someone who can analyze them even closer, because if those two are the same under, say, an electron microscope, then somebody would have to accept that somehow there are two of the exact same object, and the implications of that."

Strangely it comes back down to fundamental limits on knowing, the same ones that were already known to early philosophers: if a tree falls in the woods and there's nobody there, does it make a sound?

Okay, the uncertainty principle in a nutshell: given a state of uncertainty, something, according to quantum mechanics, is in all possible outcomes until you make a move to observe it. That is best explained by Schroedinger's cat: if you put a cat inside a fully-sealed box with no way of seeing what's inside, and then bombard that box with poison, you have no way of knowing if the cat is dead or alive. At this state, the cat, relative to your point of view, is both dead and alive until you actually open the box and observe the result. The universe then performs all its weird quantum wizardry and present to you an outcome that is logically acceptable, that is, that the cat is dead OR alive.  Buuuuuuut the catch is that generally quantum uncertainty only happens on a small scale, because of something called the h-bar; that the likeliness of this happening is inversely proportional to the total energy of the particle being observed. Sorry guys, it's improbably that the ring actually DID quantum multiply, again that was a half-assed comment.  Buuuuuuuuuut that's only if you want to be so close-minded and limit yourself to classical science, without accepting the fact that science can barely explain how the universe works and that there's still an enormous chunk of reality that science cannot fully explain. Going beyond what's science now is what makes science science.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cxkuv,TriumphantGeorge,5,Sun Jul 12 04:47:56 2015 UTC,"Excellent write-up.  The only problem is that the ""brain"" you hang this on is itself part of the experience being tuned into. If I tune into the experience of being an arctic explorer, and then into being a librarian, or the same librarian in a slightly different universe, each time going to see a doctor for an MRI, I'd get different results, since I'd be (apparently) in a different body. So...  Whatever it is that does the ""tuning in"" must itself be beyond that which is experienced, while still being an environment in which experiences are perceived...  Something which does not itself have qualities or structure or form, but which can ""take on the shape of"" these things...  In other words, if you were to swap ""brain"" for ""consciousness"" and say that what happens is:   What you truly are is an ""open space of consciousness"", and This consciousness ""tunes into"" or ""takes on the shape of"" different experiences.   Then you'd be pretty much there. And even better, you can take this beyond mere theorising: you can fairly easily prove to yourself that your actual experience right now is like an ""open space"" in which sensations, perceptions and thoughts arise, simply by directly attending to it.  By flipping things around in this way (""the world appears within you""), the consciousness/soul problem immediately stops being an issue. Of course, the world itself now becomes essentially imaginary, distinguished from other thoughts by only its relative intensity and apparent stability."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cxkuv,Beehive4U,2,Sat Jul 11 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting position, however there are a few reasons why I have tried to stay away from saying that the universe itself or the entire reality is within the brain:   In addition to reality, I believe that there's another station at which the brain is attuned into: a station where the brain actually stores its data including memories, knowledge, and information. This implies then that no data is actually stored on the brain. This could explain why some people claim to have a recollection of their past life (or access to others' thoughts), and that's because they can access beyond their own space in this invisible station. Some authors, including David Wilcock, call this the Source Field. The problem with thinking that reality itself is merely ""consciousness"" shaped within our own brains is that it takes on another bleak view of the universe. This is because this essentially tells you that everything around you is a product of your own consciousness, an effect of your own thinking. Which means that since everything is real within your consciousness, nothing is. Essentially, you are alone in the universe and everything around you is imaginary."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cxkuv,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sun Jul 12 04:56:35 2015 UTC,"EDIT: This got long so I've added some headings. This is a great post by the way, for starting discussion. Really pleased to have this sort of thing appearing in the sub.  To be clear, I do not think that reality is consciousness shaped within our brains. I'm saying that ""consciousness"" is the very stuff everything is made from. Brains are things we experience sometimes; they don't ""cause"" anything or shape anything.  Brains, Stations, Storage   In addition to reality, I believe that there's another station at which the brain is attuned into: a station where the brain actually stores its data including memories, knowledge, and information.    Just to ask again: where exactly is this brain? It can't be the body-brains we see. It can't even be within space and time, surely?  On stations: You don't need this extra invention if you have consciousness being fundamental. All there is, is patterns that are ""dissolved in"" the space of consciousness. Your ongoing experience is then more akin to recalling those patterns in the same way as you recall a memory. You are associatively exploring the world in the same manner that you explore a strand of thought.  Since all possible experiences and information are available, things like past lives and others thoughts stop being a problem. It's all there, all the time. What you are calling a ""tuning into a station"" is just remembering - associatively triggering particular patterns such that they become brighter in consciousness, via ""autocomplete"". They are always there.  EDIT: In the same way as you can simultaneously experience the room you are ""in"" and also think about something, it would theoretically be possible to end up with two parallel experiences. This might lead to apparent mental health issues. Or maybe teleportation. ;-)  World As Imaginary   This is because this essentially tells you that everything around you is a product of your own consciousness, an effect of your own thinking.   The assumption you are making here is that it is ""your"" consciousness. Actually, consciousness is impersonal and it just happens to be having the experience of ""thinking about being frankz0509 in a world"".   Which means that since everything is real within your consciousness, nothing is.   This is essentially the position of many traditions - but again, with the change that it is not ""your"" consciousness. Nothing ""is"" in the sense that there is no external, inaccessible world that somehow ""causes"" our experiences.  You are consciousness ""taking on the shape of"" frankz0509-in-the-world-in-this-situation.  You As Imaginary   Essentially, you are alone in the universe and everything around you is imaginary.   And you are imaginary too! ;-)  This isn't a problem really. Saying that ""everything is consciousness taking on the form of experience"" is no different to saying that ""everything is made from atoms and brains"". In fact, the former allows you to have agency and intelligence (awareness, intention, free will) whereas the latter doesn't.  EDIT: You are alone in the universe in the sense that you have your own ""private view"" experience, however you are not alone because you are intimately connected with all possible experience, and during your experiences you are the entire universe (effectively). The ""world-sharing model"" for this isn't simple to describe, because inherently it is not formatted in terms to time and space (which are aspects of experiencing and are not fundamental outside of that).  We need to be careful with the word ""imaginary"". It's come to be interpreted as ""unimportant"" or ""without meaning""  but really it says the opposite: everything is fundamentally meaningful. The meaning of things is actually more primary than the shape, colour, texture, etc! What we actually end up with is that instead of being alone, the experience of ""being you"" and everything else is intimately connected, part of one undivided conscious ""material"" which is ""taking on the shape of"" different experiences...  Direct Exploration  For this approach, you really need to go back to your actual experience without any preconceptions - e.g. George Berkeley and his Three Dialogues or in more modern times: Rupert Spira's direct attending or Douglas Harding's funny little experiments.   Conscious experience becomes primary. It always is, of course, it's just that we've got in the habit of imagining it isn't, starting with a fictional picture of us being ""in the world"" and proceeding from there. We don't lose any of our scientific discoveries and so on by disgarding this, but we do end up with a reorientation of what it means to ""make observations"".  This switch-around is, I think, what most historical traditions are pointing at. Even things like the Biblical parables make better sense when re-interpretated as descriptions of our true relationship to experience.  TL;DR: There is no ""solid underlying"" to the world; experiencing is like recalling memories; imaginary == meaningful."

What I mean by the brain being tuned to this universe:  Since there is an infinite number of universes out there, us being in this universe is merely the effect of our brains being set to listen to this universe. If for example, one day I suddenly experience seeing things that are not supposed to be; or I remember memories I have no recollection of having, then I'm suggesting that perhaps my brain has somehow been bumped into a different frequency.  I'd like to believe than more than just the universe, the brain is also connected to a vastly invisible field that connects all humans and that perhaps this is where all our memories and data is stored (see my previous reply) ."

However the mind, or the ethereal chunk of consciousness that exists outside space-time, isn't located anywhere and is everywhere at the same time. Think of it this way: you have 1,000 radios each tuned to their own frequencies. Each radio station plays only the songs of a certain artist. Now you, the person listening, has the choice of moving around and going near whatever radio you want to listen to. All's well and good, right? Now, say I tweak one radio (re-tune it) so that it listens to a different radio station instead, and it all goes chaotic because it's not meant to listen to that frequency. You, the person in this picture = mind; radio = brain; radio station = universe. Seems pretty clear to me."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cxkuv,GodsEyes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:02:52 2015 UTC,"Right! I see where we differ. So to clarify, you are saying:   person = mind = listener brain = radio universe = station   I'm suggesting the ""brain=radio"" bit isn't required, that it's an extra step which exists only for the analogy and can never actually be observed.  We never actually experience having a brain that tunes into things. The having-a-brain thing would be part of the experience of a universe, not an intermediary.   What we are left with is:   person = mind = consciousness  (an open aware space) consciousness ""tunes into"" particular experiences (forming itself into a ""dream perspective"")[1]   Skipping the intermediate step, this matches with our direct experience (a conscious ""space"" which seems to ""take on the shape"" of the experience of being-a-person-in-a-world).  The urge we have to fill the gap between the two steps perhaps comes from wanting to imagine a mechanism by which consciousness/mind ""connects to"" a universe - but that's not needed. After all, outside of experiencing it, there is no time of space, and so no mechanism or connection or material by which such a thing could be formed.   The mind being unbounded and unlocated, it's actually the other way around: all possible experiences are ""dissolved into"" consciousness itself. All time and space is available now. Selecting an experience/universe is akin to ""remembering"" or ""intensifying"" an image from a holographic space. (A bit like an 'Imagination Room'.) What a person is, is that holographic space.  [1] The ""dream perspective"" is always a 1st-person perspective, consisting of sensations, perceptions and thoughts. It cannot be accurately represented using a 3rd-person perspective model; it has no ""outside""."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cxkuv,Dark_Ashelin,3,Sat Jul 11 21:08:35 2015 UTC,"First, what's schizophrenia according to NIMH:   Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder that has affected people throughout history.  People with the disorder may hear voices other people don't hear. They may believe other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. This can terrify people with the illness and make them withdrawn or extremely agitated.  People with schizophrenia may not make sense when they talk. They may sit for hours without moving or talking. Sometimes people with schizophrenia seem perfectly fine until they talk about what they are really thinking.   To me, this sounds like someone who has been bumped from the correct frequency. It seems that while their body are here in this reality, their brains have somehow been re-tuned to listen to a whole different reality: which could explain the voices and things that they are now hearing and seeing. Imagine growing up listening to a classical music station. I bet you'd be surprised and dumbfounded when someone suddenly switches it to heavy metal without your knowledge, and you never have listened to heavy metal before.  Another possible explanation is that due to brain damage, the ""signal"" from the reality is being garbled. Remember analog radios where you have a knob to really tune your frequency? If the signal is weak, white noise fills the sound. Or, the schizophrenic is bordering between two stations, with a bit of both realities bleeding through."

Indeed, we currently understand that the brain functions by passing around electrical signals through neurons. Actually, that's how an EEG device works: it ""listens"" to the electrical signals on the brain and maps those into a number of wave functions that neurologists can understand (to an extent.) Related: functional MRI.  Scientists believe that since the brain is actually an electrical system, then it should be possible to send signals to it as well. It's just it's so difficult to build a machine interface to send data to the brain because in the first place, we still don't really understand what all those signals mean and how they work! The brain is essentially like a black box.    What could that/this really suggest. What are the implications of such a theory that you posit?   Additional to the implications that I've written above, there are also a few interesting things if it were true that our brain is simply a ""listener"":   Perhaps, the brain does communicate with this invisible radio station, and that's where it actually stores data (memories), instead of the brain matter like we originally believed. This could mean then, that every human being has his own frequency: and that those claiming to be in touch with their past life merely has access to the other frequency.

They are perhaps (in effect) shifted by the behaviour of people, by what their behaviour implies is true. Previous facts-of-the-world can be forgotten through neglect, and replaced by new assertions or assumptions.

Though I did remember it as Berenstein, I found it more reasonable to believe that most people are just misremembering because we were children at the time and a lot of people pronounced it as ""STEEN"" so we just inferred the spelling without bothering to double check (Similar to the Interview With the/a Vampire and Sex in/and the City for some other people).   I'm still convinced of the fact that it was always the 3rd Thursday for me, but I'm not yet sold on the Mandela Effect being proof of anything other than the brain's fallibility. It's still easier for me to attribute the discrepancy to my being mistaken from the start. Either way, I find it interesting how there seem to be multiple instances of large groups of people all being mistaken in the same obscure and random way!

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cyi0c,frankz0509,2,Mon Jul 13 10:15:15 2015 UTC,"Some further ideas on how to approach thinking about the Mandela Effect...  So, what's our base assumption here?  It's that when we observe something, the observation corresponds to a ""measurement"" of a persistent thing which exists independently of the observation.  But in fact, we never experience the ""persistent thing"", we only experience apparent persistence -  i.e. when we perform a similar measurement later, we obtain the same result. The ""external object"" is a story-making fiction, an abstraction, to link these two observations together.  And even this is too far! Because if the measurement changed all the time we would never observe persistence and we would never infer an object in the first place.   In other words, all that there is is experiences, some experiences repeat, those repetitions we call ""objects"". We then complain when a later observation contradicts an earlier series of observations, because that means the object changed. But there never was an object, only a collection of similar patterns of experience which we grouped together and called ""object"".  How come apparent persistence?  When certain patterns persist in experience, it is simply because those patterns were maintained in the mind - perhaps because they were more intense, perhaps because they were intertwined with other patterns which maintained them.  At the time of experiencing, and observation is a ""fact"" which becomes interconnected with its context. The tendency is for an observed pattern to slowly fade and become diffuse, however it is supported by the larger mesh of patterns which maintain it for as long as some part of the context remains active.  This means that changes in the larger context can accidentally shift the shape of the persisting pattern. When we re-measure that pattern (by re-triggering that experience in its context) we find that it has been altered, like a memory that has been polluted.  Relevance to Mandela Effect?  The so-called Mandela Effect is simply that current experiences no longer match previous experiences. The person infers that the object of the effect has changed.   However, there never was an object, there was only a memory-like after-image of the earlier observation which was being re-triggered. Other shifts in the wider context can deform that after-image so that when we revisit the context, it seems that the world changed. But really it's the world-pattern or world-memory that changed. (There isn't an actual stable external world in the first place.)  But don't I see objects, here, now?  No. Over time, you have accumulated many ""impressions"" and through natural patterning those impressions which share context (time, space, sub-patterns) become strongly interconnected. There is no ""object"" other than a word you have assigned to a certain ""clumpiness"" to the patterning of your experience. Objects are ideas linked to accumulated, superpositions of experiential patterns.  Objects apparently persist because patterns never go away, they are just triggered into ""brightness"" when the surrounding context activates them. All previous observations or impressions are right here, now, just very dim (like the stars in the daytime sky).   The ""room you are in now"" is, essentially, an immersive multi-sensory 3D thought that was re-triggered by the experiential pattern of ""walking through that door"". (The room ""next door"" is here, now, just very dim. You can re-trigger it be recalling the experiential pattern of ""walking back through"".)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cyi0c,lioninacoma-,2,Sat Jul 18 11:32:32 2015 UTC,"So the Mandela Effects be a result of this overall pattern completion. What would be the reason for this pattern shift then? Does originate from within the individual or a shared world.  Btw, I was thinking about that P2P theory/metaphor. Could it be that our personal realities get filled in ""on the fly""? If I've never been to France, France doesn't exist other than in the stories I've read, but once I meet a Frenchman, his version of France becomes my version of France.  Perhaps there have always been two versions of Berenstein/stain coexisting in separate node clusters of the network. At some point the network was forced to merge (internet communication explosion?), and the Berenstain reality was chosen as the merged standard."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cyi0c,lioninacoma-,2,Sat Jul 18 17:30:59 2015 UTC,"On The Fly   Could it be that our personal realities get filled in ""on the fly""?   Yes! We might say that everything exists ""logically"" prior to our encountering it, as an ongoing superposition of information. All the prior observations, to the extent that you are committed to them, contribute to your eventual observation of France.  When you actually make a ""France observation"", this logical state becomes intensified, more defined, and therefore more stable, more ""factual"".  Pattern Shift Reasons   What would be the reason for this pattern shift then? Does originate from within the individual or a shared world.   The ""reason"" for pattern-shifts isn't necessarily meaningful in terms of objects or context.  Imagine a blanket on a table. The blanket isn't flat, it has random ripples and folds. I place several different, thematically unrelated objects at various locations on the table. I then focus my attention on one of the objects, and push it This causes the blanket to be tugged and, due to the folds, the other objects may or may not be shifted from their initial location. In one sense I might say that the act of pushing the object caused the change in other objects, but I will be unable to provide a reason or logical connection to link them together.  If I deliberately shift an object, I can be certain of its new state at the moment of shifting. However, I cannot predict the effect of this on other objects, or the effect of future object movements on my present object.  The blanketed table in the metaphor is my own conscious space and world-pattern:  There is only an individual world really as far as my own access is concerned - a ""private view"". However when that world has properties identical with other ""private views"" then it is in effect in overlap with those views.   To try to be clearer: you live in your own copy of the world. The structure of your world dictates what other worlds you ""share"" with. You and I are overlapping because our world-patterns are currently aligned.  Cluster Nodes   Perhaps there have always been two versions of Berenstein/stain coexisting in separate node clusters of the network. . . the Berenstain reality was chosen as the merged standard.   We could imagine that there are infinite ""private views"" with their own world-patterns. Views are in an ""overlap state"" when their world-patterns coincide, regardless of their history.  At present, all views in a ""Berenstain state"" are overlapping. Some views will have a ""Berenstein"" history, some a ""Berenstain"" history - but all that matters for overlap is that the current world-pattern state is ""Berenstain"".  For all practical purposes, then:   You are a conscious being having a person-in-a-world experience and that is your ""private view"". Your world-pattern is always in a particular state. Your view can be considered to be in overlap with other views which are in the same state, regardless of their history. However, since both the content and overlap conditions are dictated by your own world-pattern, you can pretty much declare that you have your own world, and the Mandela Effect is a sign of shifts in your private world-pattern due to the impact of intention/observation.   TL;DR Summary   My attempt to corral this into something more readable:   It's not like interconnected nodes exchanging information and modifying each other's state.  It is like disconnected nodes which link and overlap to other nodes which have similar states. This is the same as just having a ""private view"", except that it means we all have access to the shame ""raw patterning material"" to make our worlds out of."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cyi0c,Dark_Ashelin,2,Sun Jul 12 17:16:49 2015 UTC,"pretty much everyone I know insists it was -stein and is surprised to the point of dubiousness when I tell them the real spelling. my friends, all of whom are also in their early twenties, pretty much unanimously agree that they'd always known it as -stein, with a few who didn't remember/never really thought about it.   I remember as a kid specifically thinking that the name ""BerenSTAIN"" was weird because you would expect there to be an e where the a is. so that's why I've always firmly held that it's always been -stain, at least in my reality.   personally I think the Henry VIII turkey leg thing is less an example of the Mandela effect and more a product of the media. after all, they serve huge turkey legs at Renaissance fairs because it's ingrained in our culture, for whatever reason, that medieval/Elizabethan/what have you royalty, especially a fat King, as Henry is always depicted, typically feast on huge turkey legs. so since that's an image we're used to, I can see why people would think that Henry had been painted holding a turkey leg.   honestly though, I think the BerenSTAIN vs BerenSTEIN thing can be attributed to reading skills. most kids start reading those books when they're very little. if you're a beginning reader you're unlikely to pick up on minute details like the spelling of a name. I learned to read very early, so by the time I first read the books, I would have noticed the spelling. other kids, who may have struggled to read at that time, may not have noticed. and since the -stein surname suffix is so much more common, they probably would have assumed later in life that that was the correct spelling, and likely wouldn't have felt a need to go back and look.   that explanation doesn't account for the people who have said they swear they have a physical copy of the books where the -stein spelling is used, but it's an idea."

Regarding age, those Beren-whatever books were around when I was a kid, so if the alleged shift happened more than twenty years ago, the change would have been present when you saw them as a child. Thus your memory of stain vs stein. Not saying that's what happened, but it's another one of many possibilities.  You do have an interesting peer group in that they seem to remember stein.

Heat is the movement of atoms, slower movement, less heat transference from the environment. Objects should get heavier. Objects will be slower to respond, so their inertial mass should increase. Gravity should diminish since objects fall more slowly. So either big G decreases or space-time is less warped. Did you become lighter? Sounds should become lower in pitch and quieter. Perhaps eerily silent if slowed down enough. The speed of light is unchanged, however, the number of photons entering your retina per second will be diminished. And so the lights should go dim!

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,flashen,5,Sat Jul 11 05:30:56 2015 UTC,"Hey, fantastic post. Thanks for reporting it. There are some details that I've read in other's experiences but yours seems to place things in a fresh and more usable perspective. Ironically, the places where you state that you're unsure or unable to describe things are actually pretty telling in their unrelatableness.  I'll give a more detailed reply later, but just wanted to say that I definitely don't think you're insane, and you may be on the right track of things. Well, more in a bit...  EDIT: Well, back again. Here's my detailed reply...  Normally, I'd say that heavy marijuana users' experiences would be highly suspect, since they often have an ""altered"" somewhat hazy perspective (my opinion). However, you do seem to have processed and proceeded through the marijuana use exceptionally well. First in realizing that those bad trips were inner fears coming to the surface, and then by being able to work through those fears.  It's as if you've used marijuana like some people use LSD or psilocybin. And apparently marijuana in high doses is a psychadelic. Furthermore, your ""matrix"" experience sounds an awful lot like a psychadelic ""breakthrough"" experience. So kudos for achieving that with marijuana.  This is what fascinates me:   I literally heard this presence say ""you're in the matrix"" clear as day.   also   Throughout the whole experience I heard so many amazing things. Tones, beeps, music, static.   IIRC, there was another post somewhere in this sub where the OP recounted how he had a kind of OBE and relived an episode in his childhood. In part of his experience he heard what he described as tones and geometric shapes. (I may be getting posts mixed up.) In any case, it's intriguing that someone else also heard tones and beeps. It's a weird, strangely mechanical detail. That other OP stated he thought that it was some sort of test or training sequence. That may have only been a rationalization though.   Again, I never felt scared, I felt a sense of confusion and overwhelming love.   Check out my post about a ""waiting room"" that I apparently visited:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/32mpdt/me_out_of_body_experience_visited_a/  In that place, I also experienced a feeling of all encompassing ""love"" - though not much confusion - although I guess I'd have to say I didn't know what was going on.  Anyway, back to point -  Your post makes me think that we may actually be in a matrix-like simulation. You mentioned that part of us existed in a place that felt ""incredibly advanced""...In my own, ""waiting room"" experience I remember two distinct phrases - ""What are you doing back?"" and ""We haven't seen you for so long."" The first phrase is what has perplexed me for years. ""What are you doing back?"" implies that I left that ""somewhere"" to go ""here"". It also implies that my return was expected at some point, though not at that particular premature time.  If we are in something ""matrix-like"", then that would explain the surprise at me ""glitching out"" of the sim - temporarily. It would also explain why when I returned there I felt as if I was back with many people I've known and loved for quite a long time.  I just think the idea that we may be within some technological or, at the very least, created illusion is stupendously intriguing. We don't have any evidence against such a scenario, and reports such as this one and my own experience offer evidence for it.  Imagine the possibilities if or when we find out this is true?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,Scroon,3,Sat Jul 11 04:27:27 2015 UTC,"I got this huge feeling that we WEREN'T in a matrix similar to that in the movie. But that the whole concept of 'the matrix' was the only way to communicate to me what was really going on.   I think this is key. We are not living in a simulation - but there is not metaphor which encompasses it properly. It's something more like a dream, but it's maybe more accurate to say that ""dreams"" and ""waking life"" are both different instances of ""this same thing"".   That dreams obviously appear ""within you"" even though you seem to be a body inside them, is their main benefit in the comparison (the idea that we ""take on the shape of experience""). The love and connectedness we encounter in these moments is not the finding of something; it's the falling away of the waking experience, revealing the background-that-is-you to be undivided and welcoming of everything.  It's something even more like having a ""strand of thought"" which has become immersive -  in much the same way as a thought-scene in hypnogogia suddenly ""snaps-to"" and becomes an immersive environment.  This means that the content of our experiences doesn't really matter. We tend to look at the content in our search for a ""mechanism"" which underlies reality - but I'm tending to think that reality is much more simple that that. The actual visuals and situations don't matter so much as the meaning of those experiences relative to other experiences... with no solid underlying beneath it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:45:30 2015 UTC,"I suppose the question is to what degree is this not like the Matrix matrix. (Assuming OP's guiding voice is accurate.) I guess it's amazing simply to think that this reality is quite literally an illusion of some sort. But then again,  isn't that what a bunch of religions have been saying all along?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,Scroon,3,Sat Jul 11 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"I say: it's not like The Matrix matrix, because that matrix has an underlying infrastructure to support it which is of a different type to the perceived environment. It also implies a separate control scheme and external laws and some sort of ""purpose"".  Yeah, the same thing crops up in most religions (although it seems to then get re-interpreted in other ways for moral/control purposes, obscuring the core lesson: reality is flexible and responsive). The idea I like...  Maybe our situation is an ""illusion"" because although it appears that we are people in a spatially-extended world unfolding in time, it's more like:   (As said before) The apparent world is actually a strand of thought about being a person in a world - albeit a very bright 3D/4D multi-sensory immersive thought. There is no solid substrate supporting this apparent world, there's nothing ""behind"" the experience. The room you are in now is the sight, sound, texture of that room. Just as in George Berkeley's philosophy a ""vase"" is just the collection of all the overlapping observations or patterns which are clustered around ""vase-ness"".    That means the world is basically a large stack of ideas that have become intermingled, complex and stabilised. An accumulation of observations that have come to define a fictional world?  This fits in with the John Wheeler Delayed Choice Experiment (observation defines the ""fact"" of something) as well as various magickal traditions (altered states to allow change the world) and early Christian teachings (parables describing the relationship of mind and reality) and New Thought stuff (the world is made from imagination).  The common thread? Observations define reality, and it doesn't matter whether those observations are ""external"" (sensory) or ""internal"" (thought) because in fact they are both the same thing (image-ination in consciousness). Your mileage may vary..."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:50:30 2015 UTC,My mileage has been doing pretty well actually. Weird things are afoot in this reality.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,Scroon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:23:49 2015 UTC,Oh really? Do share.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Jul 11 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"Nothing extremely notable...but, I've been working on manifesting intentions under the theory that this world is somehow a manifestation of our own intrinsic  awareness and directed thoughts. And so far I've been three for three whenever I've explicitly applied myself to it.  The latest was a couple weeks ago at the casino. (What better place, right?) I wanted to see if I could manifest winning for the sake of experiment (rather than gain). It seems to me that it's not conscious intent that does it. You can't just ""want it"" really bad. Rather you must somehow communicate to the subconscious (or whatever you want to call it) - to that part that is ""you"" but not this mere physical you. Somehow I ended up with this self-semi-hypnotic suggestion where I told myself and felt that ""the universe wants me to win"".  Five dollars and a five pulls later on the slots, I cashed out $100 ahead.  I also wonder if this fulfilled a second intention where I was believing that a stolen piece of equipment would be returned...I used the winnings to buy a replacement. Don't know if that counts, but the money covered the cost exactly.  Thing is, I've been careful to apply this intent thing sparingly. I want to keep track of bias and also don't want to mire myself in a web of conflicting potential manifestations. So this isn't like I've been blasting away and cherry picking the successful results.  Have you had this experience?  I'm still cautiously experimenting with it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,Scroon,3,Sun Jul 12 06:12:32 2015 UTC,"Nice work! Interesting that it might amount to a mix of several intentions coming together to fulfil themselves.  I've been playing with world-as-thought for a while as a way to create deliberate synchronicity and therefore particular scenes. The worldview I've been using is a variation on this:   You are an ""open conscious space"" in which thoughts arise. The apparent world is basically a very bright, stable, full 3D-sensory immersive strand of thought. The world evolves by the accumulation of observations or ""facts"".  Every thought you have about the world is literally adding a new fact to the world. Thoughts which randomly arise simply reveal the current state of the world. If you deliberately think a thought, then you are deliberately adding a new fact to the world. (This is how to make changes.) The more intense the thought, the stronger the influence of that “fact” upon your experience. If you respond emotionally to a random thought, then you are in effect re-thinking it as a more intense thought, meaning it will contribute more. (Hence fearful thoughts tend to increase the prevalence of fear-related experiences; however this works just as well for nice-emotion thoughts.) If you “grasp” onto a thought then you are persisting it - you are maintaining it at its present level of intensity and not letting it fade and be “forgotten”.  Things such as detachment, surrender, abandoning yourself, and so on, are all about letting the current dominant thoughts or “facts” become softer, allowing others to take their place.   Which means that the method of creating change or future experiences amounts to ""observing it to exist"" - creating ""fake"" observations! In other words, imagine into awareness a sensory experience which implies a desired situation to be a fact - the ""brighter"" that thought, the more impact it has.   Even just stating a fact in words can have an effect. ""The universe wants me to win"" is good enough.  As you say though, you have to do this pretty sparingly, because it means that every deliberate thought or emotional response to a random thought is a direct interaction with the facts-of-the-world and is rebalancing them.  I think the main ""trick"" becomes not the asserting of facts, but detaching and withdrawing emotional connection to contrary thoughts/experiences so that they can fade. You have to be in a state of ""allowing"" so that the world can shift easily in the direction of your assertion.  I've never tried the casino though. Have you read about Ian Wilson's casino adventures? He was trying a similar thing with ""the law of attraction"" but I don't think he ever sussed the underlying ""mechanism"" of it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sun Jul 12 07:44:09 2015 UTC,"You two might be interested in the teachings of Neville Goddard. He wrote about ""creating reality;"" though, I don't think he used that exact phrase. He was a forerunner of the new age movement, teaching in the 1950s, and he doesn't use the new age jargon of today... ""vibrations,"" ""alignment,"" and all that other woo-woo bull shit.  Goddard uses and teaches a 3 step process.   “The first step in changing the future is Desire, that is, define your objective — know definitely what you want.”  “Second: construct an event which you believe you would encounter FOLLOWING the fulfillment of your desire – an event which implies fulfillment of your desire – something which will have the action of Self predominant.”   For example, in your casino experiment, this basically means you would imagine some event that would imply you've won money. Imagine the bells going off on the machine and people congratulating you. The key point here is to imagine this scenario from your POV; that is, from your eyes. Don't construct a scenario in which you're observing yourself as a bystander.    “The third step is to immobilize the physical body and induce a state akin to sleep. Then mentally feel yourself right into the proposed action, imagine all the while that you are actually performing the action HERE AND NOW. You must participate in the imaginary action, not merely stand back and look on, but FEEL that you are actually performing the action, so that the imaginary sensation is real to you.”    I have had some success with this technique. For instance, when I had to give a class presentation, I imagined my professor giving me a thumbs up after the presentation. Also, a friend of mine said I was going to give a fantastic presentation.   After I gave the presentation, I did indeed get the thumbs up from my professor, and he used the word ""fantastic"" at least three times.   I have other examples, but that was the most recent."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,untitled56,2,Sun Jul 12 10:26:00 2015 UTC,"Yes! I've read his stuff and that was a really nice summary. He's probably the nearest to my ""literally imagined world"" take: your experience right now is literally a thought about being a person in a world, etc. As described elsewhere in The Patterning of Experience.  Neville produced so much output though that I think people get overwhelmed and put off, and some dislike what appears to be religious talk (but is in fact not). I've been pointing interested people to Imagination Creates Reality for the general picture and The Pruning Shears of Revision for further context.  I love how he (your professor) actually said ""fantastic"". :-)   It's experiences like that which led me to view reality as being super-basic. The world has no depth and there is no behind-the-scenes goings-on. You are essentially injecting sensory ""frames"" of experience, activating patterns within your perspective."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sun Jul 12 11:11:48 2015 UTC,"I think the main ""trick"" becomes not the asserting of facts, but detaching and withdrawing emotional connection to contrary thoughts/experiences so that they can fade.   There's something to this - withdrawing emotionally. For whatever reason, I think emotion interferes. Perhaps its the animal portion of the brain functioning too strongly.  I'll look at that casino adventures. I don't think you'd be able to continually win at a casino, however, since you'd still have to obey the statistical probabilities porgrammed into the slots...and physical distribution of the card decks. Plus, in my theory, you'd have to wrestle with other people's intentions in a game of roulette."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,Scroon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:35:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I think emotion could be viewed the same as other parts of a ""thought"". If you hold onto any part of a state, it prevents the shifting of that state, retriggers it, persists it. There's nothing special about the ""feeling"" aspect to experience in that regard, except that it can't be easily conceptualised (captured in language or illustrations).  I don't think you need to worry about probabilities as such - there is no programming or deck distribution beyond your observing of it - it's more about how much you are willing to break your reality, approaching an increasingly private view as the plausibility level drops. But then we're getting into ""sharing models"".  Here's something though, an easy test: Imagine yourself sat at a card table, willing the required cards, willing the behavior of other people, gradually approaching directing the whole scene - at what level of control does it feel uncomfortable or abhorrent to you?  EDIT: Even if we are in a simply-shared world (i.e. we are actual ""people"" bound to a single consensus environment) then very few people know how directing change works. They either think about it (as an abstract concept or in 3rd-person) or they formulate it incorrectly (like ""I wish I would win"", which is implicitly request for a situation which supports continued wishing). So I think a knowledgable person who understood attentional detachment and open intention would prevail."

There is a twist to it, however ;-) (although on a deeper level it is exactly as you say)  In a more fatalistic cultures there is a deep seated belief that you shouldn't 'tempt fate' and say too much about good things you are expecting, as this would bring you unluck.  I've just talked to someone whose friend's child died soon after birth - the consensus among family and friends was that arranging 'baby shower' was to blame. Now, baby shower is an American tradition that was, to certain extent, adopted by the middle classes worldwide (not everywhere of course), but is often in direct contradiction with the deeper cultural beliefs about not tempting fate, and fear of negative effects of celebrating too early.  This is, of course, a consequence of various historical conditions and experiences, and this is a separate, huge topic.   HOWEVER, if you are deeply convinced that - let's say - being stressed throughout the flight PROTECTS you from the catastrophe, and being too relaxed and optimistic actually ATTRACTS disaster, that will probably work for you this way :-)   I feel deeply anxious myself if my husband says, for example, 'in ten years time I will do something', and only when he does a counter-magic by saying 'if we are stil together by then' (or something to that effect) I feel that our plans are safe :-P"

Probably thought it was too intense of a high to be marijuana and led myself to the that conclusion.   Anyway, your waiting room post is really fascinating. It sounds very similar to my experience, in the way that we had apparently been to these places before. Who knows, maybe we were experiencing the same 'glitch'. It's bizarre to look back on these experiences and try to put the pieces together.  Thanks for the comment, always great to hear someone else's insight"

I wish I could actually talk and share experiences with you like a normal human being. I would also be interested in what you would experience if you tripped on LSD or mushrooms.   This body you are in is temporary.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,legitasl3alls,3,Sat Jul 11 03:37:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel like somebody is going to recommend you seek some sort of help for schizophrenia or something, because people hardly know shit and just follow the herd. Voices? Crazy.  I believe you man. Not because I want to but because I believe you. It usually takes drugs (altered perceptions) to have these sorts of experiences, but that doesn't make them any less real. They all come from you, after all. We have a lot of words- hallucinations, delusions, realizations- all of them just attempts at describing the sometimes indescribable. You experienced something, therefore it is valid, to you. I believe when we start to piece together what it is that everyone around the world is experiencing through drugs, meditation and dreams, we start to paint a really incredible picture.   I would love to talk to you more, maybe suggest some reading material, or maybe just have a conversation. I am sure we BOTH can learn a lot from each other :)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,untitled56,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:16:27 2015 UTC,Reading the words 'I believe you' is a bit of a relief. I've told friends about some personal experiences with drugs and they've written it off as mental illness.  I agree with you completely. Drugs are like doorways to altered states of conciousness and whatever you experience (whether it's truly 'real' or not) is still a valid experience to you. It would be great talking to you more!
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,legitasl3alls,3,Sat Jul 11 06:06:31 2015 UTC,Look up Terence McKenna. He believed mushrooms (in which psilocybin is the active ingredient) opened the doors of perception to transcendental experiences. I'm sure he must have spoken about marijuana as well at some point.

It feels that way because you put yourself out there, knowing what you've experienced is either hardly or never experienced by anyone else.   It is. However, we all have very very different personal interpretations of these things when we come back down. But we never forget how pure of a state it was. More real than reality some would say :)  You can pm me any time. I have Skype as well, but if thats too personal, that's certainly okay. I actually am pretty awkward and would never just throw Skype out there like that, but I like you. It's truly only on the internet that I can even discuss with like-minded folk. Everyone in my immediate life is just simply disinterested in anything but themselves or superficial things.  Well, maybe it is I who is the superficial one, judging others too quickly through the shallow conversations, not giving them a chance to go deeper with me. However, I doubt that. I truly believe most people haven't experienced many altered states. Most people I know have never even tried meditation because they ""can't waste their time sitting around doing nothing"".

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,untitled56,4,Sat Jul 11 08:40:15 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, nothing. Sometimes, something. Something extraordinary, but I don't do it for those moments. Truthfully, I would say increased awareness, a higher sense of self, love for myself and others, and most importantly, peace. I had been extremely depressed a year ago, and meditation, as well as one experience with salvia have sort of hit a reset button on my life. It was a gradual change that led up to my salvia experience... that one was an immediate shift of consciousness. Everything I thought was a problem, just wasn't. Everything I was stressed about, easy. Everything others stressed about, easy. I still can get depressed or anxious, but it's very different than it use to be. It's a lot more manageable. I am much more conscious of my thoughts, and therefore my actions. I don't find myself regretting my actions and choice of words the way I used to because of this.  Do you keep up with it? I struggled for a long time with not doing it every day, but I realized eventually that I kind of had to. It really takes some discipline to experience all it has to offer. Discipline sounds like work, I know. Meditation felt like work for a while for me, but now I can honestly say I truly enjoy my time meditating. I love to do it outside or laying down. I noticed that my mind (and I am assuming most human minds work this way) gets really boggled down with all of the information I've consumed. Anything from reading, watching, playing games, really any sort of stimulation creates thoughts and they just sort of sit there. Meditation is almost like a form of release. Your mind strays to all sorts of places, however you don't have to... you are just the observer of the thoughts. No matter how scary, morbid, or blissful they are- they aren't 'you'.   If I could offer some advice, it would be this... Just sit. Just sit and observe your breath for 5-20 minutes a day, maybe even twice a day, if you can. The time isn't really important. What is important is that it's consistent. When I say observe your breath, I don't mean fixate on it. Your mind will wander from time to time, and then you will remember ""oh shit! I'm not focusing on my breath anymore"". That's okay! Just redirect your subtle attention to either the breathe entering your nostrils (and out) or the inflation/deflation of the stomach. Even observing your heartbeat can be pretty interesting. It is expected that your mind will wander, don't be frustrated, don't resist. Allow it to happen, notice it, but bring your attention back to whatever you were observing. That is the most important part."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,legitasl3alls,3,Sat Jul 11 10:05:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, Legit.   I just did it for about ten minutes which flew by, actually, and it was rather relaxing. Unless you count quieting your mind before sleep, then no, I haven't done it on a regular basis, but I will try to do ten minutes each day.   I agree, thoughts are not who we are, but 'things' we grab onto, and sometimes hold for longer than need be.  I've never tried salvia, but I'm always looking for ways to pierce the veil.   I don't usually get stressed or worry about things; though, it has been known to occur. ;) I can definitely relate to the depression, so I'm hoping that meditation will alleviate that to at least some degree.  I'm sure my depressive symptoms are due to chronic alcohol use, but I'm on day six without, and I'm hoping my body chemistry and hormone / neurotransmitter levels will return to normal soon, and the depressive symptoms will subside. TMI - my apologies.   Anyhow, I'll continue to meditate and see what happens. Thanks again, Legit."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,untitled56,3,Sat Jul 11 10:51:36 2015 UTC,"You are always welcome. Thank you for spending the time to share with me :) All of the information you shared has given me a little more insight into where you are coming from, my friend. There is never too much information, and you have no reason to apologize for showing that you're human. I think that's rather brave of you sharing that and I want to congratulate you on your progress so far. It's hard to notice how far you've come with only a few steps up this mountain that is a healthy and stable life, but before you know it, there will be a trail behind you to reflect on.   Actually, that quiet time before bed is a form of meditation as well. Day-dreaming-meditation. Meditation is simply the natural state of being. We take away the distractions and we are just left with our thoughts. These thoughts would be there anyway, however they might have a little more influence on your mood if you aren't really observing them and asking yourself why you even have such a thought in the first place. That takes practice.  Speaking from experience, salvia was the only thing that truly ""pierced the veil"" for me, so to speak. I had taken magic mushrooms before just once and while it was very spiritual for me, I was really with the wrong people and some pretty terrible things happened. It wasn't until I did salvia that my world was destroyed, rearranged and pieced back together within 10 minutes. Salvia finished what shrooms started for me. I was sort of in a daze after my first psychedelic experience (mushies), unsure of what to make of my experience. Lady salvia is a healer, but only to those with honest intention. Those looking for a sweet high will not only be disappointed, but possibly petrified. It was the most terrifyingly beautiful experience of my life. I don't mean to be such an advocate, however my personal experience with it was nothing but positive. That's all we can really do, right? Share personal experience.   One last thing. Meditation is less about actively trying to quiet the mind, and more allowing thoughts to come, and go. The quieting happens naturally, need not be forced.  Thank you, untitled56 :)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,legitasl3alls,3,Sat Jul 11 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, you want to know where I'm coming from? Oh boy... ;) I like you, Legit. You're a good guy.   I've taken shrooms 4 times, but like you, each time I was with the wrong crowd. It would be interesting to take a large dose and meditate — the same with salvia. Shrooms makes my head foggy for at least a day or two afterward, though. Is it the same for salvia? Or are you pretty much back to normal after an hour or so like marijuana?   I've been having trouble sleeping this past week, but since you reminded me about meditation, I cleared my mind while laying in bed last night and fell asleep pretty quickly. It'll be easier for me to keep up with the meditation routine if I do it before sleep each night. I will.   Piercing the veil... man. Terence McKenna spoke once of the ""Cosmic Giggle,"" describing it as follows:   ""The ‘Cosmic Giggle’ is a randomly roving zone of synchronicity and statistical anomaly. Should you be caught up in it, it will turn reality on its head. It is objective and subjective, simultaneously 'really there’ and yet somehow is sustained by imagination and expectation; the umbilicus of our ontology, the place where we see that the world came from something very different from what it now appears to be.” — Terence McKenna   I've been in that cosmic giggle (CG) a few times. Incidentally, for me it always occurs in periods of sobriety which is another reason I'm choosing not to drink. Really, I think the CG is a state of mind brought about by staying in the moment (think, Eckhart Tolle), but I can only get there when my body is detoxified. Within the CG, reality becomes magical. You can see the connections between events, the connections between thoughts and events, and the connection between your state of mind and your experience of reality. It's not merely looking on the bright side, or seeing the glass half full, etc., it's more like reality conforms to your inner state, and the beliefs you hold about yourself and the world around you. It's hard to explain.... hopefully, when my mind is more clear and I experience the CG again, I'll be able to give you a better explanation. Being in the CG is the closest I've come to ""piercing the veil,"" and there were no drugs necessary."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,d0desu,2,Sun Jul 12 09:58:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, I totally understand this ""cosmic giggle"". I would say that described my salvia trip... until it became total ego loss just seconds later. I have also experienced things very similar through a sober (meditative usually) state. For me, it confirms... well, everything. However, like all truths I have experienced. I always let them go. The truth is all around you, and always comes back when we forget it or get too distracted by ego. I love Terence McKenna so much haha.  I will give you the simple run down of what went on during my salvia trip. I remember it all, but my girlfriend was right next to me when it happened too, so she sort of plays a role. Load up pipe with 20x extract. Not much, just a pinch. (I don't know if I would do 20x, a lower dose, or just plain leaf if I were to ever do it again. I am leaning towards plain leaf). I torch the bowl with my lighter, leaving the flame on it the whole time. It disintegrates fairly quickly. Within seconds... I couldn't remember if I had already smoked it or if I was just about to... linear time just sort of halted. I was experiencing being on salvia before I smoked salvia, or something really close to that. I truly cannot describe it clearly to myself. I had a little bit of physical discomfort. Actually, quite a lot. It was pretty terrifying honestly. Then it was really cool. This all happened within the span of maybe 10 seconds. I am starting to say ""No... no.. no. no no no no... no. no... no."" because what was happening at this point was total familiarity, a constant deja vu. I had done all of this... I had done it all. I am it all. Then utter euphoria, but so much more. All encompassing love. Synchronicity like you would not (or would :)) believe. The reason I was saying no so many times is that I had dreamt my entire experience a few weeks before. At least I thought, or knew I did at the time. But you know how altered perceptions can be. It was the ""trippiest"" experience I have ever had. I mean it... my perception was in a looping tunnel of nostalgic, euphoric, all-knowing, all-loving, complete, nothingness. Total ego loss.   I hardly even got in to the utterly insane part yet though. This part doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but I'll try to explain the best I can. This is the first time I have ever written any of this experience out, so this is actually quite nice to be reflecting on this again, but it may come out confusing (my apologies). After my time of saying ""no..."" and somewhere before unity, non duality, ego-death, enlightenment... I called it all of these things at once when describing it to myself. But words had lost meaning at that point. I just laughed for an hour... towards the end of the trip, and for that whole hour afterward. That beautiful feeling did not go away until I decided to smoke it again two weeks later. I later came to regret going back, only because I wasn't ready to fuck my world up again. It is truly sacred. Fuck, okay where was I. Oh yeah, during the middle part of my trip, after my girlfriend had disappeared. I forgot she was even there, or that I had a girlfriend, or that there was a real world that my body was still inhabiting. The crack of some other-worldy, dimension or tear or something else had split open from the left side of my vision. In it looked like some sort of family room with everybody I have ever had any sort of relation with. At least it felt like it. They were all smiling. I was fucking terrified. I couldn't even look at it because it wasn't going away. It didn't make any sense but I didn't even want to go near it. I felt I could walk through this portal and never come back to this world and I didn't even want to try it. I must have been visibly freaked because my girlfriend had calmed me down and gave me a hug at this point. This brought me back to the beautiful setting that we were at and then BOOM. Call it cosmic giggle. Call it ego-death. Call it death itself. It was magnificent. Everyone was cheering for me. These spirits or these... these beautiful things were surrounding me, congratulating me. I felt like I was in a colosseum where I was the entertainment for these beings. They felt like... YOU DID IT. YOU ARE HERE AGAIN! WE LOVE YOU!!! Oh my god it was nirvana. I knew everything. Every piece of information that I had no business knowing, all mine if I wanted it. Think Akashic Records. I thought it would last forever and I would become some genius. Wait we already are all geniuses, wait we are god. It doesn't matter if this state goes away because we already have it. We are it. These are the closest things to thoughts I even had at this point. It was pure feeling and knowing, rather than trying to prove anything to myself. Like you or McKenna said, ""objective and subjective"". The duality of everything made complete sense. Every opposite was the same thing, it was just the subjective experience(r) that made the difference.  The comedown is bliss. Slowly the ego comes back and wants to ""understand"". But I need not figure anything out. I tried to selfishly take all of the information I had learned with me, but there was no reason to. What I need was and always will be there. Nothing lost nor gained, except awareness. Most beautiful hour of my life, although the trip only lasted 10 minutes. It sure makes continuing on a little difficult after you are surrounded by the material world again for a while. You may find your way back to the cave. You might pretend you've never seen the outside, that there is no ""outside,"" to this cave, but awareness doesn't just go after one gains some. I drove home after walking around that beautiful park for about 30 minutes. Nothing could bring me back down. Not even traffic. :)  I don't really feel like proof-reading, so I hope that came out legibly. Salvia Divinorum is a beautiful plant, but it deserves complete respect, like any mind-altering substance. To anyone interested in it, I say do some research, do it right, set the right frame, and watch the world rip apart in fractals. There is a lot of terrifying stories out there, but use your judgement. As you know, not everything is as it seems, and sometimes ""bad trips"" are just from resisting what you aren't able to yet understand.   I hope this has helped with your curiosity. Let me know if you have any more questions or if any of that was confusing at all. Keep up with the meditation, my friend. Adding a morning routine to that regime is never a bad idea too. Best way to start the day ;). Learning to enjoy your time meditating and observing your thoughts is essential to integrating the ""impossible"" into your life. It's really all in your head, you know what I mean?  edit: Oh yeah, I remembered one small detail about that other ""dimension"" I could feel myself there as well. Almost as if I was laying on the floor in that dimension or whatever the hell it was. It was some sort of family room but with everyone I have ever known. I barely even looked at it because I couldn't get myself to look at this impossible thing. It was incredible and terrifying at the same time. I hardly know what it means either. Another dimension? My interpretation of non-duality? I have no clue, but it didn't just like close up on its own. It remained there for the remainder of my trip, I just started to ignore it after not knowing what to do with it lol. Now I wish I would've turned and just jumped inside it. Not that it would've worked, but who knows. Crazy shit mayne. The best way to describe it is another dimension. Another layer of reality. The only way it comes out though is ""hallucination,"" and I am not denying that as it is entirely possible. But one gets a very different sense when he is experiencing it first hand. I wish I could find an image to explain this best, or some video, but not much luck. I am finding some really interesting trip reports though now. I sort of avoided trip reports before I ever tried it out of fear of being scared into not doing it. Really interesting stuff when I type in ""salvia dimension"" on google.  At the end of my trip I felt like a toddler again because of how happy I was. I felt like I finally found everything I was looking for, and although I still crave knowing more... I realized that I had found exactly what I had been looking for. I remember shouting ""YES I DISCOVERED THE ANSWERS TO EVERYTHING BABY! THE UNIVERSE ALL MAKES SO MUCH SENSE"" to my girlfriend lol.   ""The most valuable experience one can have in order to understand the true nature of the universe/reality is an experience that will make you see that it's not important to understand anything, but to feel. Feeling is what connects you to yourself and everything around you, while rational thought and 'understanding' attempts to separate and categorize which is ultimately fruitless."""

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,phubans,3,Mon Jul 13 18:53:13 2015 UTC,"I believe you OP. I had a very strange experience 5-6 years ago. I had a long conversation with a presence. I don't do marijuana or any psychedelics. I don't usually talk about it and although i post on other subs(gaming related etc), i follow this sub, but never posted my experience. I was going to, but it ended a couple of pages which i then deleted. After i've seen your post i made an account just to post a reply with a summary of my experience. Here is a good time to also post a disclaimer: i was diagnosed with schizophrenia after and because of this experience, so if anyone thinks i'm just crazy then stop reading this.  Ok, so i was living in the UK when this happened. I'm not english, i'm greek. The conversation i had with this presence was in english (for the most part) until i asked him to talk in greek. I remember everything we said in english, but none of our talk in greek although his greek was just as perfect as his english. It's like this part of the conversation has been somewhat deleted from my memory along with other parts. He did say to me that i would not remember, and only after i insisted that i want to remember, i assume they let me remember some large parts of the conversation clearly.  I'm not going to type the whole conversation cause it'll be a long post. When the whole conversation started, i remember myself asking if time had stopped. Something felt odd although i cannot remember why or what i was seeing. He asked me ""is this how it feels to you?"" he pauses, then says ""yes...it stopped"". He then talked to me about religion, in which i interrupted and said i don't believe in any religion, i'm an atheist and a sceptic. He then asked ""When did you lose your faith?"" I went on to explain that as i was growing up i was more interested in science etc so i gradually lost interest in religions. He replied ""that's not when you lost your faith"". He then said ""Well, what do you believe in?"" He asked me if i watch movies and then whether i have seen ""the matrix"". I said yes i 've seen it. And he goes ""i will unplug you from the matrix, i will show you the real world"".(<-this is why i decided to post this here, OP) I started getting scared cause i did not understand what he meant by that, and i still don't.   Anyway, the conversation went on for quite a while. We talked about alot of things, even though i had the sense he knew all about me and he told me so. The questions were more like trying to lead me somewhere or maybe he wanted to reveal something to me. I don't know. At some parts our talk was alright, even though he was sort of speaking in riddles somewhat.(as in, not quite revealing what he's on about). At other parts it got really terrifying.   He gave me the impression he knew what he was talking about and i was the one who was clueless. He was speaking with authority while i was petrified for the most part. Sometimes he was sympathetic towards me. During the entire conversation, it never crossed my mind that i was speaking with a presence out of this world. For some reason, i thought i was speaking to a human being, even though our talk was strange, he knew all about me, even knew future events about me. Sometimes he would talk about them like they have already happened, using past tense. At some point, I remember me asking about something he said and he goes ""You don't remember this, it hasn't happened yet"". The conversation ended with ""Remember this date"". I'm not sure if he gave me an actual date to remember or not.  Then one day i was in town, i remembered this incident and i panicked. From then on, strange coincidences(synchronicity?) started happening all around me. I was feeling immense fear and dread. It was overwhelming. I had to talk to someone. I called my ex, told her something is not right, i don't feel too good, i'm scared. I didn't say what happened though. She said maybe you're homesick. We talked for a bit on the phone, she suggested i talk to a psychiatrist in the hospital. I also called my sister, she told me she'll book a flight quickly and she will come see me and if i don't feel good we'll fly back home. I went to the hospital and while i was talking with the psychiatrist, at some point she repeats something that this presence told me without her realising i had already heard this a similar phrase from the supernatural. Obviously this didn't help me, my fear increased but i never said anything to her. Next day my sister arrived, and a day after, we flew back home.   Strange coincidences continued back home too. I was seeing a therapist, diagnosed with schizophrenia, and from then on my life started going downhill. I was breaking down and several events that this presence told me would happen, actually did happen. Like for example, i was hospitalised for about a month and a half, forced to take medication etc. The presense had told me all these things. I knew all this would happen to me, i just didn't want to believe it. About year later i tried to kill myself. I knew i would try this eventually. Then i tried again, and was again hospitalised and put to a psy-ward after i recovered. The strange events would start and stop no matter whether i was on meds or not. Eg. on my 1st suicide attempt i was in hospital and one night i open my eyes and see a woman right next to me. She says ""drink"" and gives me some water from a bottle. Then i go back to sleep. The strange part is that i never seen this woman in my life and she spoke to me in english - while i was in a greek hospital.   I could go on and on with these strange things, but you get the idea. And i haven't even brought examples of coincidences that would constantly happen to me. It's been some years since this happened, i'm not on meds for a long time, and i stopped seeing therapists. I do get the odd coincidence here and there but it's not overwhelming at the moment. Also i should point out that never ever have i heared voices or seen things, even though i was asked by the presence, whether i would want to - to which i replied ""no, that would drive me completely crazy"" and he said ""Fine. But how are we gonna talk?"" So anyway. all i had, was a very odd conversation with a presence and lots of strange events afterwards, some of which i was warned about. I have never talked to that presence ever again after that day, even though i want to. I have alot of unaswered questions. I don't believe i'm schizophrenic, i believe this really did happen. I do believe that this experience has caused me fear and panic attacks, as well as depression. It was a one off experience, never had a talk with anything supernatural again. I did have strange coincidences though, and a few of them were also noticed by a friend of mine, when i was talking to him about this, he was next to me and things started happening. I never hallucinated, never heard voices, never seen things that aren't there. Still the ""therapists"" had their own opinion as well as power to make my life a misery for quite some time - like hospitalising me in a psy ward against my will and forcing me to take meds i never really thought i need. Or easily convincing my family that this is the best course of action for me (and they will do all this harm to others with a smile, actually believing they are helping, no matter what you tell them). When i was hospitalised in a psy ward, i think i went through all psychological phases any normal person would go through in this situation. First it was denial (this cannot be happening to me, against my will), then anger (you don't know what you're doing, you're not helping me - i demand my freedom) to compliance in the end - I realised that the only way out of there, was to just stop talking about this experience to them, be nice to them and act as though it was all just a fantasy and the meds are really helping even though some of them made me feel like i was stoned. So they did not ""cure"" me, they just made me obey. You cannot discuss your truth if it does not agree with their ""truth"". 1984 at its best. I've seen alot of things on how the ""system"" works. Also some people (like some doctors and staff) will really enjoy their power over others. I've seen that too. As you can evidently tell, I've lost my trust on the system, modern medicine and people. Anyway, this post is already too long, i'll just stop here.  TL;DR Had a conversation with a presence and strange things started happening to me afterwards. Cause of this experience, doctors thought i was schizophrenic and made my life a living misery for quite some time. I still get strange coincidences here and there and i have not talked to this presence ever since."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,moonchild42,3,Sun Jul 19 23:05:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, I remember highs like that quite well... That inner 'voice,' too; I always associated that with being God or my higher self. I don't really hear it any more, but that's because it's been, wow, over 7 years now since I last smoked on a regular basis, but for years it was something I did every day. Eventually, these experiences built up to one that changed my life and got me to quit smoking indefinitely. Now I'm stuck with the knowledge of knowing that none of this is real but the burden of shouldering the pain of existing here."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,legitasl3alls,2,Sat Jul 11 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"You dont know how relieved I feel to find people that went through the same as I did. I had that feeling of doubting reality for the past year and I know it feels awful but think about this: if reality isn't real, then what is it? It could be a dream. But dreams as we know them are build with our desires and fears and our everyday experiences. Dreams would not even exist if we experienced life as an empty white or black space with nothing around and no stimulus at all. So if life is just a dream or an illusion, something is creating it. I felt disoriented for a very long time but I started trying small things, just because. I tried to remember how I felt about life when I was younger, and before I was 6 years old. I tried to remember what was I expecting from life at the long term. What nice things I would like to remember when I am in my deathbed. Even if you think that life is not real, try to play a game. Life is a film set, and a movie with a lot of actors is being filmed. Movies are not real situations, but they can still make you feel things. Imagine there is no director, only a bunch of writers, each one writing the script for one character, and you are writing the script of the protagonist. So if you were the main character in a movie, not being able to change the past, how would you like this movie to continue? What would you like to feel when the movie is finished?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cv2pc,Ohmygoditsabird,3,Sat Jul 11 08:49:02 2015 UTC,"I've been doubting everything too. If we're just part of some illusion, what's the point after all? I've been looking at our perception of dreams as a metaphor for this whole experience.  If you become aware of the dream while you're in it (lucid dreaming), you now have better control of the dream. Doesn't change the fact that you're still in a dream. So in 'real life' as we become more aware of the illusion or 'dream', it doesn't change where we are. We only have a better understanding of the truth which may lead to a better understanding of ourselves.  The greater knowledge we have of ourselves, the easier life may be. The path to better understanding could lead to a more enjoyable life. Like you said, what would you like to feel when this is finished?"

In this view, in certain cases bad vision comes from having built up bad habits which keep the eye under tension -  either due to an ill-conceived notion that you have to use effort to control your eyes directly, or as a way of 'blurring out' the world.   There are techniques to tackle this and the first sign they are working is the experience of occasional ""clear flashes"" like you describe, e.g. the Bates Method."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3crfwy,TriumphantGeorge,2,Fri Jul 10 05:28:20 2015 UTC,"In support of this, I've had times these ""clear flashes"" as well, usually when I've been well rested.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3crfwy,Scroon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:25:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting about contacts maybe helping relaxation; I suppose it removes the feeling that your are ""peering through"" something. Anything that makes you push out with your attention is probably bad?  There's a thing called ""seeing from the core"" where you let your centre of attention (""where you are looking out from"" not where you are looking) sit back in your head, or lower in your body, and ""let the world come to you"". I found it made a big difference to my perception, even though I'm cautious of calling it an improvement in eyesight."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3crfwy,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Jul 11 14:41:39 2015 UTC,"Your eyes are fluid filled sacks surrounded by muscle tissue that distort the eye on order to change the distance between the lens and retina. A subtle version of this happens when you change your focus from near to far and back again. Those muscles are generally outside of conscious control, but it's not impossible for them to readjust in the way you experienced."

While the eyeballs are surrounded by muscle, and muscle flexion does distort the orb somewhat, this is not the primary method of focus for the eyes.  Focus control is achieved through the muscular distortion of the lens tissue which sits behind the cornea.  Also, while focus does occur automatically in most situations, we do have some direct voluntary control over it. Just try to make your vision go ""fuzzy"" and you can see this for yourself."

As for the memory, the human memory is often flawed. It is very common for someone to remember doing something and then find out that wasn't exactly what happened.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cp8zb,Kidjdm,4,Thu Jul 9 20:19:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for the late reply, I've been quite busy recently. I assume the dream must be caused by some sort of anxiety related to my consciousness leaping between realities. Obviously I couldn't piece that together at a young age, and because my father told me he experienced the same nightmares, I figured it wasn't too bad for me. As far as recent events, about 6 months ago I had been driving to Miami on work related business. The drive isn't too awful bad from where I am, but it was still a long enough drive to stop at a hotel. I booked a specific hotel room for one night, and arrived at 9 P.M. I was asleep by 10, and during this time I had the dream. When I woke up, I couldn't figure out what was wrong for a minute. It scared me more than anything else ever has. I was worried something was really off. I finally noticed the floor which I had not inspected very well was a different pattern. The hotel itself had changed from a Days Inn to a LaQuinta Inn. The entire place was different. I checked out and discovered my car was in a different parking space after about 30 minutes of panicking and pressing the chirp button on my keyfob. Everything about the convention was normal, but when I returned home, my house's orientation had changed. The whole street faced a different direction and it was painted a different colour entirely. Nowadays I don't say anything to anyone and it nearly drives me insane."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cp8zb,Cartessia,2,Sun Jul 12 03:47:42 2015 UTC,"As far as my dad goes, he told me when I was around 14 that every time he awoke from the dream he would have bad anxiety attacks for the following weeks. The most recent case he referenced to while talking to me was in 2001, and the only problem he complained of was anxiety attacks. This was as ny anxiety was getting worse and worse. He remembers going to the hospital for his anxiety. I also went to the hospital to be monitored during my sleep to see if they could determine if the dream was linked to my anxiety."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cp8zb,yonreadsthis,3,Mon Jul 13 05:55:41 2015 UTC,"As far as pop culture goes, I have a tendency of making myself look stupid, because I will hear someone talk about a relatively popular film and never have seen it. I'm currently at work watching 'World War Z' with my co worker and quite frankly, I've never heard of it. I love movies and I keep up with them, but when things change I learn about new movies, music, which is not really always new, but it's new to me."

After a shift, I remember that Hey Arnold was scheduled to stop airing. Then, I learned that Spongebob, which to my memory at the time was a small independent cartoon that just recieved backing by Nick, was the most popular show on Nick. I remember seeing a preview for Season 1 of Spongebob dated 2004, and then after the dream and flip, it had been around 5 years earlier.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3coix6,Smatty10,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:29:39 2015 UTC,"In fact, that's what I first thought. But when I checked on the shells in the trash, there were two [practically four, since they WERE one in the other]. So there's still no explanation for where the third one came from."

Also, was there maybe a moment where you thought about making three eggs rather than two? Because that goes in to the parallel universe thing where in one you decided to make three, but in this one you made two and then a glitch happened and other you left the egg on the sink...I don't know but I'm with you on the glitch thing. I want to believe this kind of stuff is happening."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3coix6,ElevenEleven-time,2,Thu Jul 9 19:42:36 2015 UTC,"I usually make myself two eggs [such as in this case], and I make myself three if I'm really hungry since I don't eat much. When I walk to the fridge I debate on whether or not I'm hungry enough to eat three eggs.  If it counts as proof, there were only two yolks in my plate. I wasn't even considering the parallel universe theory, so thank you for giving me an another possible explanation!"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cnxdd,ToRi1436,3,Thu Jul 9 11:11:15 2015 UTC,"yes. I remember once reading a scifi book named, ""Worlds of the Emporium"" where this guy gets kidnapped off of the street by a civilization that wants to use him because he is the double of a wold leader in another alternate world. The man describes alternate realities as always happening on a small scale, houses suddenly changing color or not being there when you remember them being in the spot for years. But, people don't pay attention.  Well, when I read that I had this eerie feeling that at least this part of the sci fi story was from real life.     This stuff happens a lot and too often to be a trick of memory for the general population."

Second, when you go through a traumatic experience (because of the experience itself or the reaction that people have when you tell them about it) you repress the memory as much as you can in your subconscious because it's easier to live thinking that it never happened or that it wasn't real. You need some stimulus to start remembering ""scenes"" from it until you can finally remember and accept the whole experience as real somehow and speak about it, and that process can take years."

Lyrica, morphine, percocet, parafon forte... Yeah. So, quite frequently, I'm caught in the loop of 'Did that just happen?' versus 'Am I hallucinating shit again?' nonsense. My husband rarely ever sees / senses these things, but my father frequently sees the glitch, oftentimes before I do.  Then again, the man loves his mind altering substances. So who the fuck knows.

The basis of a glitch is that we've experienced a ""mistake"" in this reality's fabric. That entire theory distinctly blurs the lines between the mental and physical world, since it relies so heavily on the experience of subjective perception.   I think at least half of the shit on this sub is just that-- shit. But my fiance often knows things before they happen, and I grew up with a ""poltergeist"" that my family would ask to return missing objects (and he would deliver.) Is that all in our mind, or a physical reality? The difference seems inextricable due to the subjective nature of each individual's experience."

Overall, I definitely think the simplistic idea of a ""spatially-extended world"" which corresponds to our perception of it, is false. I don't think the world-as-it-truly-is, is laid out like this room seems to be, for instance. The true nature is more like a dimensionless information gloop (which cannot be described in language, so even that is incorrect), stabilised by observation.   But that leads to so the opposite problem: why, exactly, do we have a stable world, rather than a completely glitchy one?  I don't believe that particular descriptions (""parallel universes"", ""computer simulations"", ""quantum immortality"") are right, because I don't believe any metaphor is right. But some of those metaphors are more useful than the common ""solid world, laid out in space"" metaphor, when it comes to unusual experiences."

PS: I personally believe that some of these stories may be true, since there are a lot of unexplained things in our lives, such as Deja vu's, dreaming of future events, etc. However I do not believe it's something supernatural or that we live in ""the matrix"", but rather that there is a scientific explanation behind this which we simply haven't discovered yet / are unable to discover with our current technology."

Sigh. Honestly, this go-to explanation of ""the glitch is all in your head and shared experiences are just mass (but somehow also calm) hysteria"" seems to me to be lazy, if not outright arrogant.   Edit: Forgot to answer your question. So, why do I think glitches happen? Well, I think reality is in a way a matrix itself. Consensus reason and rationality keeps reality ""regular"" and holds it together. But sometimes that regularity fails and chaos ensues.

And then there's the genuinely mind baffling stories that may or may not be true. Maybe a false memory, or a dream, or maybe just something that sounds more dramatic when they retell the story than it was to experience it. And there's the drugs and so on and so forth. I've even seen a few people post on here and later be diagnosed with mental diseases, which then calmed them down, the medication putting an end to the glitches.

You remember having one controller you usually use, you remember the MotionPlus controller, your brain mixes up the two memories and believes your controller was a MotionPlus. That kind of memory confusion happens often; usually it's with weaker memories and when you try to recall them, you can tell they're not completely accurate (the feeling that you aren't sure or can't quite remember); however in some cases it can happen to stronger memories and/or go undetected until new information conflicts with the memory.  It sounds like you never had a MotionPlus controller and your memory of it just got mixed up with a memory of such a controller.  Unless of course the game requires a MotionPlus controller, then it wouldn't make sense that you didn't have one. But I think Mario Kart doesn't require it."

It's not like his consciousness travelled to the clone in the next parallel universe, leaving the other body lifeless or is that what their implying? Either way, I don't believer both scenarios. Going back in time and changing the past would create alternative timelines or parallel universe's where everyone exists simultaneously in different realities. I would hope so..."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cl863,Lucid003,3,Thu Jul 9 02:48:14 2015 UTC,Thanks. I had a feeling the mirror one was a dream... but I can't seem to figure out the other ones.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cl863,thecoolrobot,3,Thu Jul 9 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely a dream. I've had similar experiences that go along with sleep paralysis. I'd wake up, start my day, realize something's off (the walls would be at odd angles or warped, I'd feel like I'm floating, that kind of thing) and then I'm back in bed, awake.   Sometimes this can happen several times in a row, and eventually I'm fully aware that I'm not waking up properly but I'm still trapped in the cycle, until I remember that kicking my leg out usually wakes me up for real. That usually takes a few attempts, but once I'm actually awake I know (mostly because everything is suddenly boring and dull and colours are all cold and grey compared to the warm olive tint those dreams have).  I'd say your experience is related to sleep paralysis, but definitely influenced by whatever caused the other creepy things."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cl863,WholyFunny,3,Thu Jul 9 15:59:14 2015 UTC,"To help you confirm if something is a dream or not, there are several tricks you can do.   Flip a lightswitch. It won't control lights. It will do nothing, or will control something unrelated. Look in a mirror [You knew this one]. Check an analogue clock. The hands will be missing, or otherwise unreadable. Read a book. [Or read anything.] The part of your brain that reads is dormant, so you might 'know' what something is 'supposed' to say in a dream, but you cannot put letters together to form words, and words together to form sentences. Jump. Did you stay in the air too long, or maybe come crashing down way too hard, but are unhurt? Talk to someone. Are you actually using your mouth to form words, or are you just thinking of what you want to say, and they are responding?   In order for these to actually work, it has to be a reflex for you to question your reality. I assume a lot of people in this sub already do that, so continue to do these checks especially when you 'know' you're awake. [You can find more by googling 'reality checks + lucid dreaming' into google.]   The baby crying sounds like it could be the cat. Did you have it the entire time these occurrences were happening?"

I live in a private subdivision in a somewhat rural area. The street in front of my house was a dirt road. We didn't even have regular road maintenance, let alone people planting trees or anything like that.  Plus, this is not the sort of tree you would go and plant somewhere for decorative or other purposes. It is a rather spindly, drab looking native species of which my street is FULL of and there are literally forests of it all around here."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cjdpm,dickwhistle,3,Thu Jul 9 03:43:41 2015 UTC,"This is why it's so hard. Of course you won't find proof because in the reality the tree has always been there. Also, you may notice if you look closely at your thoughts two competing memories and a desire to hide the memory of the world without the tree from yourself. Usually fear is the driving emotion to wipe the original memory. This at least from my research is what tends to happen.  The tree appearing means you moved a significant distance from your original world. I would pay close attention to external world events that happened prior to when you had noticed the change. You should see small difference with famous actors not having died when you thought they did or dates of events being off from what you remember.   I would look up StarFire Tor and her solar flare/time alteration theory. She believes that time is constantly being altered as if it is a dynamic system. Solar Flares are evidence of the stress caused by the change. Just a thought."

Modern media started around the 1960's (say) and the yearly output of music, television and film has increased dramatically over time. The amount of stuff out there is enormous, and current technology means that the whole of entertainment history is available simultaneously.   If there are millions of songs out there but limited outlets, what are the chances that the thought in my head is reflected by something being played within a reasonable timescale?

But 4 plates are the usual starter set size, so I think it is safe to assume that you broke at least one plate, the one you remember breaking and vacuuming most recently.    Your friend may remember the first one from last year, but perhaps that is a false memory, planted by your recent report or a psychically perceived image of you running the vacuum cleaner.  But let's accept that you are both correct. Then your magic plate is an example of what old time mediums would have called apportment. I think of apportments as artificacts of a micro-micro blink of a moment when a time line collapsed.   Ancestors still further back might have worshiped the Holy Plate, but the apported object is never the point of the story. The objective, as far as I can see, is to expand the witness' reality/possibility conception spectrum.    It becomes an event that we examine, tweak, review, like looking for a solution to Rubik's Cube.

On some level, you kids knew she was pregnant, so you feel like there ought to be a fifth sibling.  2) Your dad has more children with some other woman, and you guys suspect/know this but have suppressed it.  3) You all had a close friend or cousin who spent a lot of time with you when you were young, and you expect the presence of that person when you group up."

We've always felt like somebody was missing, when we all get together especially. Another thing that is interesting to me is that when my son was born he was nearly a twin. In the first trimester his mom had some complications the doctors pointed out that it appeared there had briefly been another fertilized egg but it didn't make it very far. That is pretty common with a lot of pregnancies, so it's not too surprising, but what is really interesting to me is that my son tells me when he was in the womb he had to fight a monster, and that he eventually killed it with a sword.

Well, one mother's day I put together a card, had us all sign it, and added, ""even George from downstairs"". She thanked us but looked really weird, and left the room a few minutes later.

Neal (my son)reported this morning his stomach was bubbly and Ned (my spouse) as well since last night. I think Champ (our dog) had the same issue judging from the stain on the carpet like he he tried to make it to his cage. Champ has not had an accident on the rugs in a long time.  Ned called me while on his break at work and stated that while on the phones at work today 2 callers responded to what he was thinking of asking them before actually asking them. When he got off the phone with me he was walking through the hall, opened a door, and hit Ben hard with the door who was standing right behind it. He apologized to Ben who stated that he did not hit him and that he stepped back when he saw the door opening. Kevin says he knew for sure that he had hit someone because of the resistance and he felt the aura.   When he talked to me about this door incident I could only think that he hit Ben's other causing another Ben to reappear and notice the door prior to being hit. -glitch.

The ""physics of information"" proposed sound a lot like Kant's noumenal - which I think of as a collection of dimensionless ""facts"" which are basically your observations-so-far, dissolved into the background of subjective experience.

In a certain defocussed state, random thinking might get blended with the world-thought and be incorporated into it.  Thought Experiment:  You draw a picture of an owl on your TV screen. It is always there, but its visibility depends upon the rest of the imagery onscreen. When the dark scenes of the TV show switch to a bright white scene, suddenly the owl ""appears"" - it is ""manifested"".  Now instead imagine an owl idea being dissolved ""holographically"" in the space around you, and replace the notion of dark/white scene with appropriate contexts. Having ""drawn"" the owl into the space, you go about your day.  Mostly the owl isn't anywhere to be seen, but wherever an appropriate context arises then aspects of the owl idea shine through and are manifest: A man has an owl image on a t-shirt, the woman in the shop has massive eyes and eyebrows like feathers, a friend sends you an email about a lecture at the zoo highlighting the owl enclosure, a newspaper review of Blade Runner talks extensively about the mechanical owl in the interrogation scene, and so on.

Something like Bohmian mechanics does permit non-locality, and some of his stuff is becoming popular again. (EDIT: This paper is worth a read as regards energy, thermodynamics, and information.)  Of course, having a theory or not doesn't prove or disprove anything - if someone makes actual observations, then that's that. As far as I know, there are quite a few studies showing beyond-chance influence over random processes, but nothing dramatic like levitating chairs and so on! There's some coverage at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and work at Edinburgh University.  TL;DR: Undergrad physics can give us the illusion of certainty in a world of ambiguity. Maybe it's more about informational patterns than quantities and fixed relationships/laws?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3ch2dx,5secondstozerotime,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:21:02 2015 UTC,"A paper involving the odd concept of the relationship between information and energy, and how both are connected to entropy, still has nothing to do with pyschokinesis.   Beyond-chance influence   What? No... I just read up on this. The concept of guessing involves probability, which allows for any set of states to occur, however some states would be more prevalent than others. So if you do predict something, and get it correct above the expected number of correct guesses, it doesn't really mean anything.  Non-local information transfer is an ill-defined phrase. Please explain to me your definition of it.  Also, why did you bring up undergrad physics?"

Um, you should maybe ""just read up on this"" some more. Plenty of papers out there proving some small effect. The nature of the effect is something else of course. Princeton's PEAR not a bad place to start. Individual experiments often show something like the decline effect, though, which is interesting in itself.   Also, why did you bring up undergrad physics?   I just got that vibe - someone who has the certainty, but not the knowledge or larger context. I was the same. Things are more subtle and less definite than one might assume; models aren't truth, they are simply efficient fictions with predictive power.  Just reading beyond textbooks and popular science quickly puts things in perspective, whether that's Schrodinger's lectures or George Ellis, etc (more recently here).  EDIT: My own view is that unless we study some philosophy of science - I like a bit of Paul Feyerabend - and have some familiarity with the reasoning behind idealism and materialism (nice bit of Berkeley or whatever), then we don't really know what ""doing science"" actually is, and are in danger of fooling ourselves."

There are experimental observations of an effect but no satisfactory theory to discuss (as far as I am concerned).   And that's because we have no sensible account of consciousness yet (""emergence"" being a non-explanation), which is of course vital in this. That would, in some sense, be the ""cause"".  There are things like Integrated Information Theory  and Hoffman's Conscious Realism which attempt to relate consciousness to the underlying nature of the world, but then we're talking metaphysics rather than physics. We're hitting the observer boundary. We're at ""the thing before"" an experimental observation takes place.  From an experimental point of view, all that happens is (say) the ball bearings have a distribution which deviates from chance in the predetermined direction. There is no apparent mechanism.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3cd4tv,charliebeanz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:57:00 2015 UTC,"Thats perfectly fair. But we should also note that there is no absolute guarantee that all phenomena in the cosmos must be well-behaved, predictable, measurable, and easily able to be understood by replicating them in a laboratory under highly controlled conditions before independently documenting them again and again and again in scores of different labs by scores of different scientists.   Just because it hasn't been published in multiple different lab reports doesn't mean it does not and can not exist. The best thing to do is to approach all hypotheses with equal parts skepticism and open-mindedness, otherwise you may find yourself denying a phenomenon that is happening right before your eyes."

Makes it feel completely pointless to go to sleep. And now here I am up at 5am and I haven't gone to sleep.  No dreams sucks as well. I always enjoy that odd random dream that I get once every few months.   I thought that this was an interesting phenomena and I'd like to know if there's a scientific explanation to this.   It's what's supposed to happen. I think.   Wait.. The better question is: do you get dreams every night? O.O Can we switch places?  Edit: to clarify on the science bit a little more, when you wake up what's ""supposed"" to happen is that your memories of your dreams get erased.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3ce0xm,parafact,2,Wed Jul 8 00:57:40 2015 UTC,I dream every night. It seems I enter that stage at with you dream relatively quickly too. I'm a nurse who works 11p-7a shifts 2 times pr week and I also take melatonin at least 2-3 times per week. Maybe try melatonin?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3ce0xm,pearlsweet,2,Tue Jul 7 20:59:22 2015 UTC,"I've considered it. It's always something that baffled me. Since when I do dream (very infrequently, like maybe once every few months) it's typically pretty realistic/vivid, as if I were awake.  However, other than that, my sleep tends to be 'normal'. Takes me maybe a 1/2 hour to an hour to get to sleep, and then like OP mentions it's just a ""second"" and it's morning. If I didn't have an alarm, it's usually pretty late in the day, and if I do, it's when the alarm goes off (or sometimes I sleep through it).  I never feel 'tired' throughout the day. Though in the morning I have that ""want to go back to sleep"" feeling which wears off after a few minutes, or I have coffee or w/e.  Should melatonin help? Ideally the only things I'd like to change are: More regulated hours (I tend to fall asleep at a different time each night, and wake up at a different time each morning, regardless of how hard I try), more dreams, and being able to go to sleep faster.  The no dreams thing is my main concern. Since it makes sleep feel entirely pointless, and makes me not want to go to sleep, and thus messing it up even more. But I figured there wasn't really anything I could do about that."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3ce0xm,Kafke,2,Tue Jul 7 21:04:29 2015 UTC,It shouldn't hurt to try. I give it to my 90 year old patients. Start with 3 mg

You could have this Epic dream that seems to go on forever, and wake up to find only 45 minutes have passed,  or you could feel like you are laying in bed not sleeping at all, but everytime you glance over at the clock another 2 hrs have passed, so you must have been.

I screamed, and ran to my parents' room, probably terrifying them.   It happened again the next night and the next, until I stopped being afraid and started paying attention, and that's when I realized that what was filling my head every night wasn't nothing; it was everything. For whatever reason the universe, every galaxy, every star, and all the seemingly empty expanses in between, everything had chosen to pack itself into my mind, and it very nearly drove me mad until I learned to stop fighting it and just embraced it as it was - an infinity resting between my ears for a while.

It wasn't like footsteps in my room, or in my house, or on the stairs, or anywhere, but they were in my mind. I could hear these footsteps, walking along in this echoing room. Every now and again I would hear a voice echo alongside the footsteps, but the echo was so far off from the original sound I could never tell what it was saying.

In one, I would be sitting on a white, egg shaped object (of which I could only see the little that was in front of me) and I would be surrounded by what I can only describe as space. Sometimes, it was pitch black and made me nervous. Other times it was filled with pinpricks of light like stars. Usually the egg would abruptly stop moving or tip forward and I would end up falling off.   The other dream would put me in a completely white room. I could never tell where the walls ended, or how big the room was. It always felt too small and too big all at once. There was usually an organic shaped object some distance in front of me, and if I focused on it it would start to change it's shape in ways that were really unnerving to the point I would wake up.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c6ida,-dexter,11,Sun Jul 5 08:21:24 2015 UTC,"I have a friend like that, too! From the second we met, it was instant bonding (we met when I was 21 and she was about 18). We have never lived in the same city, but whenever we get together, it's crazy magic. We seem to attract bizarre circumstances, incredible luck, just really magical energy when we are together.  When we were in our mid twenties, we went to Mexico together-hitched rides (from Canada), and the whole trip was bizarre! We ended up being in Mexico with no money (this was in the early 90s). We got to a point where we were VERY telepathic. We'd be sitting on the beach and we'd look at each other and talk, but no words were coming out. We met all of these Mexicans who helped us out, and an old Masonic type retired Navy guy who had a blue-eye ring, and every time it looked like we were in deep trouble, something magical would happen.  And, like you, we would have these 'moments', which I can't explain (but thinking back, I can conjure up the feeling-almost an ecstasy and a knowing of everything). One time, I looked at her, and thought 'I was a man and I was married to her at one time'. I didn't tell her this because I didn't want her to think that I had a crush on her (we are both straight). But then, a few years after I had thought it, she said to me 'sometimes I get a feeling that we were married in a past life and you were my husband'.  I haven't seen her in about 4 years. We are in different provinces, with kids of different ages. We talk on facebook a little bit, but really, we don't feel as if we need to connect. I do know that if I went to her city, we would hang out and bizarre, amazing things would happen.   These are some of the things that we experience when we are together:  crazy synchronicities. In fact, synchronicities which will attach to other synchronicities, and will branch into even more bizarre synchronicities.  telepathy-almost more of a 'flow' where we pretty much act as one entity, deciding without saying, what we are going to do next. Similar to when you see twins that act as one.  meeting bizarre people, or entering into bizarre circumstances. I can't think right now of any particular experience, but the kind of stuff you tell other people the next day, and they just can't believe it.  When we are together, people give us things for free (think-meals, rides, cool stuff). We have incredible luck.  When we haven't seen or spoken to each other in a while, and then we connect, we'll find that we both have been doing the same thing (we both took up and gave up knitting at the same time. We both went and bought a terry towel bathrobe on the exact same day, etc).  I sometimes used to wonder what it would have been like if we had been roommates! I wish that we had had a chance, but maybe it was good that we only got to see each other once in a while. The energy between us was way to strong and overwhelming."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c6ida,ashirviskas,3,Sun Jul 5 19:40:28 2015 UTC,"I had a simmilar experience. There was this guy, we met because of our mutual friends. When we started talking, it felt like feeling what the other one thinks. We talked simultaneously, the deepest topics that we've ever talked about. From side it may have looked like we were having two monologues, but actually we were talking with each other. He was finishing mine, I was finishing his sentences. I felt ideas in his mind and he felt mine. We talked like this for.. Well, maybe for 10 minutes, maybe for an hour, I don't know, as I wasn't doing any pauses in my speech. It was weird.  I'm not a psychologist, but there's this thing - MBTI. It's a personality type theory and according to it we're both the same type (INTP), so our thinking patterns are really simmilar. At the time I was interested in studying Bioinforatics (I'm not sure it's called like this in english) and he was studying it. We had simmilar struggles in our lives, but that short ""chat"" helped both of us. We talked about meaning of life and everything and it was really awesome. But other than that, we didn't spend more time together as we quickly get bored of each other as it feels like you are just meeting with your brain brother. Maybe something simmilar happened between you two?"

I want to stress that while our ""connection"" was the most intense during that day, it actually wasn't the most important part. Yeah it was incredible, but there was this overarching beauty totally separate from our coincidences that we were seeing.   Thanks for writing this, I'll definitely look into those personality types :)"

Thanks for the subreddit, I'll look into it.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c6ida,pussyconqueror,3,Mon Jul 6 05:08:03 2015 UTC,"May I share something similar? It may be a bit different but I think it relates.  Back in 1994 I was at a dance. I remember looking at this girl across the room and feeling sort of drawn to her. It may have been simple attraction but it's hard to really remember that. I remember exactly what I saw and almost all of what I felt.  So, I sort of chased her around and eventually got her number. Danced with her a couple of times.  I wrote her 1 letter afterwards but never heard from her after that until I left the state. When she did write back the mail forwarded her letter.  For the next couple of years we were pen pals. Part of me always felt regret for that. Like there was meant to be more interaction.  The last letter I got from her was that she was going to apply for a University near me. I moved to the other end of the county and go caught up in a lot of things.  By now it's 1999. I had not heard from her in years. I didn't know where she went to college.  One day I'm hanging out in a dorm of a friend who went to that University. Another old friend of mine had gone to school there. I was about to throw a Halloween party and wanted to invite my childhood friend and asked my other friend to look up her number in the college directory. Suddenly my mind remembered this girl who I had met in 1994 and I blurted out to my friend to check for this girl's number too.  It turns out that this girl was going to school there. I called her a few days later and we talked for like an hour. It was like we were best friends suddenly. Having never spent time together I asked her to see The Sixth Sense with me (just to date this situation properly). We went and had a great time. It was like we were old friends instead of 2 people who had only ever seen each other one other time.  Let me skip a few steps and say we started dating a little while later. That's when things sort of started to work.  There was a definite connection between us. We both felt like we were each other's imaginary childhood friend. I felt like my imaginary friend was there with me when she was around. I also had an uncanny ability to know where she was. It came in handy more than once.  Specifically I remember one day she was having a very hard day. Cell phones were not common yet and she didn't have one. I tried to call her because I could feel that something was wrong. Like she was very sad. Her roommate didn't know where she was. So, I got in my car and drove to the campus right up to where she was. Well, the nearest door. There was no parking there just loading and unloading. I couldn't leave my car. So I just waited. About 20 seconds after getting there she walks out of the door and gets in my car with tears clearly having been wiped off her face. She knew I was outside when I got there and came out.  One odd thing. I could do this with my best friend too. At least to some extent. She believed it worked with her but not with my best friend.  Anyway, the tragedy of this, to me, happened a year or so later. I was living in West Africa and she was having a really hard time. She ran out of money and dropped out of college. I remember that I could feel her moving to the North one day. It was weird from that far away.  A few months later, when things got really really bad I felt her reach out to me. I could really see her in my minds eye and audibly heard her call my name. It was weird. I asked the other people I lived with if they heard her voice since it was so audible to me. They didn't. A moment later and the connection was severed. I couldn't feel her anymore.  Sometimes I think this was all made up. It lasted years of my life. Decades really.  Last time I saw her was about 10 years ago. She came and visited. My wife was pretty cool with her. We didn't talk. I mostly talked to her husband. I think it was hard for him really. I think he could see that we had this crazy connection. What was strange for me was when I was that close to her I could almost feel it. I could also almost feel her blocking me out.  From time to time since I think I might be feeling this connection again. I'm not sure though. It's not the same as it used to be. I can tell she isn't the same as she used to be.  Whatever this is I never really thought of it as a glitch in the system though. I always thought it was the way the system should work and the rest of life was the glitch. The way we are disconnected from each other compared to that seems like the glitch."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,Jobexi,7,Mon Jul 6 02:07:54 2015 UTC,I once was in a major accident. The odd thing was it occurred on my normal route. Beforehand I kept getting urges to turn down different roads. A few times I made a serious effort to take a different route. I had never had those urges. It was bright and sunny out. I got to my usual turn and was hit head on and spun around. I lost consciousness for perhaps seconds and woke during a dark night. People already surrounding my car. I c I uld already hear sirens. It was awkward. I still haven't found the cd I had taken out of the cd player or the cd I had put in. The date was 3/22/2002. I walked away despite hitting my head on the windshield and ending up in the back seat.   Very odd experience.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,Coolbeanz7,3,Sat Jul 4 22:03:14 2015 UTC,"""It was awkward"" sums it up so well.  It sounds like there was a force trying to keep you safe. You never hear stories about ""I didn't listen to my gut and I got in an accident,"" you only ever hear how lives were saved because of a mysterious force. It's so interesting that you ignored it and it turned out badly."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,theendishigh,3,Sun Jul 5 02:17:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting perspective. I've heard a healthy mix of ""I listened and was fine"" and ""I didn't listen and now I'm sad"". What I haven't heard is ""I followed the feeling and now I'm sad.""  I haven't concluded anything in particular from that."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,Scroon,7,Sun Jul 5 04:26:22 2015 UTC,You were in shock. That's what happened.  Also I've never had a DVD skip.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,YipYapYoup,2,Sat Jul 4 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"Could you expand on when exactly you had the experience of being ""aware""? Was it seconds before the accident? Was it as the accident was occurring? Was it minutes before?  Also could you provide more details on the scenes you saw?  It's possible that at moments like these we loosen our grips on the current reality and thus free ourselves to perceive other workings in the universe. I guess it's like a ""rage quit"", and you decide to hop servers."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,Scroon,3,Sun Jul 5 16:50:36 2015 UTC,"I think it was minutes before because it seems like I was ""seeing"" these moments as I was coming off the ramp onto the highway and I don't think I wrecked near the ramp. It's like there was nothing in between the ""awareness"" and me hitting the ground, though I know there must have been.  I can't exactly describe the scenes I saw, because it was so fast and they seemed to be all at once. I know I was seeing them, because I remember how odd it was to see everything at once. But I very specifically remember the feeling and knowledge that it was every possibility that ever occurred. I was still dating my ex, I was married, I was in kindergarten by the blocks. I don't remember exactly what I saw, but I remember knowing what it was. Knowing that there are multiple realities and I was just in this one.  The scariest part is just what you said, I was losing my grip on reality. I actually lost my own reality."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,moonchild42,3,Sun Jul 5 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"That's extremely interesting. I might guess that you may have been actively searching for a reality where you survived the accident and somehow were able to witness the instantaneous ""search"" before settling on the current one.  I don't know if I'd call it losing your own reality since each choice we make creates a new reality in itself. Besides, in the old one, you probably died. So in that sense, nothing was lost."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,Coolbeanz7,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:58:23 2015 UTC,"Or it all happened in less than a second where the brain was freaking out and in shock because it thought it was about to die. Anything that happens in someone's mind, especially right before/during a car crash shouldn't be taken as physical facts."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sun Jul 5 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"Why not? A mind under stress is more apt to make errors of perception, but that doesn't mean that the entire quality of an experience should necessarily be discounted. For example, could we say that a person who was physically beaten can not be trusted to give a somewhat accurate description of the event and their attacker? It becomes a slippery slope when an experience is invalidated simply for the reason of a malfunctioning brain - thus any experience that does not fit accepted theories can be automatically discounted as erroneous data.  Fyi, I'm writing this for the sake of argument (not to be an ass). :)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,dickwhistle,2,Sun Jul 5 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"I had similar experiences. This thing about being aware of all the possible universes happening at the same time. But I consciously searched for this ""information"", like it was somewhere inside my head. I usually meditate but I also feel it when I'm high. It is a very weird experience and I could write about it some other time. The thing is, I always feel like ""I have to die"" to get the full message. Like this information about the universe is a film that you play in your head, but you never get to see the actual full film unless you are dead. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the brain releases DMT when you die. Or maybe I'm just losing it. You may say I'm a delusional, but I'm not the only one."

I think that experience might have opened my brain a bit to new experiences. Though as they say, ""Don't try this at home!"" As I wouldnt wish it upon my worst enemy...Its a shit scary experience. Remember we typically use only a small part of our brains. The rest, the ""gray matter"", remains a mystery to science and ourselves. Perhaps specific types of flight or fight experiences unlock certain aspects of that part of the brain we aren't used to using. (Food for thought!)"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,dickwhistle,4,Sat Jul 4 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I was just having some fun there really.  Obviously, there are no people at all, just person-in-a-world experiences (sensations, perceptions, thoughts) floating in a conscious subjective space. In other words, what we are is a ""conscious perspective"" which can choose among experiences.   So there's only one ""us"" in terms of a particular instance. And perhaps only one ""us"" in terms of there only being a single instance overall.  (Or some such thing! Maybe!)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,Coolbeanz7,3,Sat Jul 4 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. I don't really feel like this us could be the only instance of us. I'd like to think all instances are each in their own layer of a double-helix spiral, all being pushed and pulled down the toilet of the singularity.   shrugs  Seems just as feasible."

But then maybe some don't to a certain degree, while others are fully invested in the idea that they are the one."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,dickwhistle,3,Sat Jul 4 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"There is only You. You are living all of the possible lives and experiencing every possible perspective simultaneously. The past, present, and future are only just concepts that help us organize how we think about events. Beyond that, there are no temporal boundaries. The You reading this message is the same as the You typing it, with both events occurring simultaneously, though I will have written it some time before you will read it, from our perspectives."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,TriumphantGeorge,3,Sun Jul 5 06:32:43 2015 UTC,"I think the problem here is the active wording, but it amounts to the same thing. Just as you suggest, we need to flip things around for it to make sense.  All possible lives, all possible experiences or ""moments"", exist - simultaneously and in parallel, like a memory-block. What you truly are is the conscious perspective that ""recalls"" these moments.   Since the block is eternal, then over ""time"" all possible moments - all possible events from all possible perspectives - will ""eventually"" be experienced by within that conscious space.  Strictly speaking, this means that you do not ""do"" anything as such, you simply ""have the experience of doing"". However, since intention and consciousness are ""outside"" of the memory-block (or: experiential memories are chosen to arise ""within"" it) you have power of selection.  (I've played with this a bit elsewhere.)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c4rna,Scroon,2,Sun Jul 5 07:12:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. As you said, the problem is our limited vocabulary. But you are exactly right.

As a corrective measure, the brain assumes it happens and pulls from memory what happens to falling cups and overlays the memory with the new memory.

Dunne links? I'm at a part where he talks about a ""serial"" nature of time and observer. He addresses the issue of an ""absolute"" or higher time that I've been wondering about."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c2tjy,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:12:33 2015 UTC,"You only need to read the time travel one (just an extra couple of paragraphs). The other two links are a different perspective, and a more granular version, respectively.  I've read Dunne before. He's basically talking about all time laid out, now. He gets a bit stuck with his multiple observer regress, though. The Infinite Grid skips that by saying: there is one observer, you-as-consciousness which is outside time - and all the world is dissolved in you. By ""recalling"" different moments in sequence, you have the experience of time.  Time isn't a thing which passes, time is just the existence of different patterns of experience, simultaneously. The ""experience of time passing"" is like ""the experience of road signs passing"" on the highway - it's when you move your attention spatially across the landscape of moments.  That's my thinking anyway."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3c2tjy,Dark_Ashelin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth pursuing just from an interest point of view. What it does point out nicely is (in my view):   The ""world-pattern"" can in fact be cut up in any number of ways - and slicing can work across conceptual lines, keeping one part static and the other dynamic - but for as long as you try to have ""the observer"" be positioned somewhere within the pattern, you'll be forced to keep creating new levels of ""time"" and ""attention"". The only way to have free will, intention and a coherent conscious observer is to have a copy of the world ""inside"" the observer. This observer explores the world by manipulating it into different levels of ""brightness"". (Like an origami paper game being shifted and unfolded. ""Dream is destiny!"".)   But tinker about and I'll be interested to hear your conclusions."

Then enjoy being invaded by ""The Owls Of Eternity"". One interesting thing to note is that at first it'll just seem like you are noticing more owls in your environment, then you'll notice that owl-related events are actually coming to you - and finally you'll realise that you are having owl experiences that can only be explained by retroactive change... hence ""Eternity"". In effect you have inserted new historical facts into your world.

""Top"" kinda depends on the most casual reader, and the most casual reader just wants to be entertained.  As time's gone on it's become easier to distinguish the common themes of genuine reports: basically, discontinuities in the location or timing of things, or ""patterns"" overlaying experience, often with a sense that groups of people have fallen out of sync with their subjective observations. They tend not to be very story-ish or make logical sense, or if they do it's quite dreamlike; they mostly just are.  The creative writing efforts tend to have neat conclusions, an emotional open ending, or encourage ""audience participation"". The genuine reports usually end inconclusively and in confusion (EDIT: or wonderment).  Obvious fiction usually gets removed or downvoted now; if something seems borderline then it's often a jumping-off point for good discussions.

It's where I come when the world is too much, too depressing...it's my escape, and now and then, I find a gem!   This is my refuge from reddit itself sometimes. I feel like this subreddit has some really wonderful people contributing to it. Even in disagreement, there is a basic level of politeness that doesn't exist in a lot of places. We all come here with different levels of skepticism and belief so we give each other the freedom to express what we need to without judgement. I've never posted here and feared I would be attacked and even better, the majority of people here don't give off that air of arrogance that comes from thinking ""I'm right and you're wrong"".   We allow for the possibility that we could be wrong. We entertain the impossible. It's serious and just for fun. I get so tired of arguments where some one has to come out on top as the definitive bearer of knowledge. This subreddit gives you the freedom to explore reality as whatever you imagine it may be. It's the mystery and the possibilities of the unknown that makes it all so much fun.  That may have gone off on a bit of a tangent but I love this sub, too."

A sub that encourages unverifiable stories without demanding proof or mocking OPs is are more likely to get 'genuine' reports from people.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bsgq5,qualiawiddershins,26,Wed Jul 1 22:31:34 2015 UTC,I thought /r/nosleep was always fiction and the 'all stories are real' rule was more to keep the atmosphere and not break the suspension of disbelief. Can you point me to some of the suspected true stories?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bsgq5,yonreadsthis,12,Wed Jul 1 22:55:24 2015 UTC,a number of OPs have mentioned they posted their story in nosleep before learning it was for fake stories.

Although one time I called out a guy for writing like that in one of the paranormal subs, and he said he honestly wasn't making it up, just that the story had been told so many times in his family that it had gotten to a point where it kinda sounded sensational and written. He could have been totally lying, but that could have been possible too. It's really hard to say.  With that said, I feel like most of the posts here don't sound fake. I think the majority of them actually happened to people, but whether they are due to a paranormal phenomenon or just some explainable phenomenon (like a ""brain glitch"") is up for us to decide.  I dunno, maybe I'm too trusting."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bsgq5,suspiciously_calm,2,Thu Jul 2 02:13:52 2015 UTC,"I think that's definitely plausible.  All the stories that start off with, ""This happened to my parent/grandparent/aunt/uncle/etc X years ago."" are obviously going to be embellished and sensationalized as they've been retold over the years.  Think about any stories from your family and how often they've been retold.  Say Uncle Joe won the lottery.  A big event in the family.  The first retelling, Uncle Joe won $1000.  Tenth retelling, Uncle Joe won $10,000.  50th retelling, Uncle Joe won $100,000.  I like all the stories because I like to keep an open mind about how the world works and how it's structured."

It's a disappointment to learn a story is false, but even stories that aren't false may not be true.

It's their ""first time posting"". Yeah, I doubt many people who find their way here wouldn't already have an account. It's a very niche subreddit. It becomes obvious that the poster doesn't want to be held accountable for their ""story"" to avoid having to create details to answer people's questions.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bsgq5,infin8ty,3,Thu Jul 2 02:47:55 2015 UTC,"I believe most of the stories here are actually real, whether they are truly glitches or have a rational explanation is a different question. However I can relate to many of the experiences posted here and I know how strange reality can be sometimes. Rationality can not explain away everything.  The post you linked to as an example could be fiction, it does have a certain writer style of the kind you often see on r/nosleep. That doesn't mean it's automatically a work of fiction though, even good writers can experience strange things and want to write about it. Anyway I don't worry much about whether something is real or fiction, for me reality is one grand work of fiction we are constantly creating, so the boundaries between reality and fiction are always very thin and often blend into each other. As Bill Hicks once said: ""Life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves."" I do believe that contains a lot of truth."

Do I think there is a logical explanation for these mysterious things that occur to a good sum of posts here? Of course I do. But still, as unlikely as it may be, there is a chance that perhaps what had occurs to these honest story telling people was in fact mysterious.   What I'd like to see more from people stories fiction or not is pictures. A lot of people reference objects or events that could easily be photographed later after the fact.   I have room for believe because I too experienced something I can't explain. I posted it in paranormal but I suppose it could have been posted here. At the time it felt very real, and very scary but even still I'm willing to chalk it up to the possibility that I am mistaken."

The rest are so meh that they have really bring down the whole meaning of this subreddit. The sandwich shop story was just awful.

Unless you have to make a decision and take action based on information, it can just remain information, to be enjoyed for its own sake, or to trigger other ideas.  Good writing doesn't mean something is fictional - but I'd say that since this sub is about reports rather than ""stories"" (as in, the entertainment is in the facts not the telling), it's better that this takes the form of clarity rather than making it a ride."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bsgq5,Wxlson,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:18:42 2015 UTC,"At least we can discuss whether or not we think the stories in this sub are fake. On /r/NoSleep they used to try to pass it off as people's real paranormal or unexplained stories and made it against the rules to call out obvious bullshit, when it was pretty clear that most them were made up and meant to be ""2spooky"". I'm glad they now make it obvious in their sidebar that the stories are meant to be fictional. I can understand the rule about acting like everything is true if it's a role-playing sub, but actually passing it off as real stories was just too much.  Sorry for the rant, I guess the point I'm getting at is that while it's sad to think that many of the stories here may be made up, as long as discussion is kept free, /r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix shouldn't end up as a ""/r/NoSleep lite"".   And as it says in the sidebar here, there is also /r/TheTruthIsHere for paranormal stories that mostly seem to be genuine (at least from the perspective of the OP).

That doesn't mean they are right or I am write, just that they are different views.  Nosleep fustrates me because it is fiction trying to pass itself off as believeable using a style of writing suggesting it comes from disorginized thinking trying to lend credibility to the stories.  What I see happening with nosleep is that is undermines peoples real experiences (whether brain glitch or not it still feels real to them) and belittles the stories within subreddits that try to express real events.  Nosleep makes fun of these things by making these experiences into stories to scare.  Some stories within the glitch catagory may be made up.  But I believe the majority is not.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bsgq5,HentMas,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"I think that on any sort of internet forum like this you have to accept that deliberate fiction is bound to crop up. Whether it's just for attention, to see whether people will  believe you, or like in the example you gave, as a creative outlet.  With glitch stories in particular, I think that for a lot of people they actually believe their own stories (at least to some extent). But there are so many psychological, purely cognitive explanations. The human brain is a fantastic, extraordinarily clever thing, and it can produce many bizarre effects or 'glitches' that we can't consciously compute. I think a lot of the stories here can be explained by purely psychological, as opposed to supernatural/glitch phenomena.  Also remember that we never hear the full story -  no matter how much depth the OP goes into, we have no idea of their personality, their psychological make-up, their emotional dispositions, etc., - so this makes it hard to find psychological explanations of individuals' stories."

The weight of strangeness may have firmly placed the prose and premise before them in such ways as to inspire narration of their glitchy experiences.  Those are milestones in life and milestones do not just mark a life, they shape a person.  They almost beg the viewer to find better means of expression for such unique experiences."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bsgq5,Uzaka,0,Thu Jul 2 09:32:41 2015 UTC,"The majority of these reports describe real events in the experience of those reporting the events. Whether the events, themselves, are real is another question.  Most reports seem to involve misperception.  Once in a while, someone slips in some fiction, but that's fairly rare, and fairly obvious if your job is in publications (mine is).  You caught one suspect story, out of how many? So?"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3btzt0,shawnnnj23,2,Thu Jul 2 05:15:00 2015 UTC,"I believe we all know our story prior to being born.  Although there will be decissions we make that can affect this storyline, the storyline will correct itself in unusal ways.  Sometimes we know in advance what will be a highlight in our lives even those moments we think are unimportant.  Time is a phenomenon that is required within our 3D existence that separates experiences we are meant (or decided ) to experience.  Without the creation of time, all events would blend together and the one who is experiencing these events would not gain the full understanding of each event unless it was singular, no other distraction.  May I suggest what may have happened with your time events changing...  Your grandfather was contacting you through a distraction to catch your attention (phone ringing) so that you werre more focused on recieving the news of his death.  Perhaps the purpose was so you would begin a journey of thinking one could live after death.  Grandpa may have been very excited with this new knowledge and wanted to share it.    Time slowing down could possibly be about viewing an event in close detail.  Perhaps you were going to do some major damage that couldn't be repaired if there wasn't a correction made right away.  Perhaps slowing down time distracted you,  or possibly was required to make those adjustments?  Meeting the love of your life and seeing life events flash before you is another way a major event is directed so that moment would occur as it was neccessary.  You may have expreienced these things rapid to add some credence as you were required to get up and talk with her.  Can you think of another way this could have been intense enough for you to follow through?  I think we are all painters painting on our perspective canvis.  The story is already written and we are but actors on a stage.  Sometimes we are off que and require a correction so the story flows as it is meant to flow."

Four others went and the rest of us stayed behind. The entire time they were gone I kept saying to everyone else that I had a bad feeling that something bad was going to happen. Then, all of a sudden we heard a loud screech and crashing sound. The car my friends were in hit the tree in the front yard which bashed the front end pretty bad.

It reminds me of a story I've shared here before about the time I couldn't find the wall outlet in the dark as a kid.  I knew exactly where it was and was hard to miss because it was in a small space between my dresser and the bed.  Maybe a foot in between of space.  Well, one night I woke up and realized my nightlight wasn't on and freaked out because it was so dark. I could barely make out the nightlight on the edge of my dresser so I grabbed it and crouched on the floor where I knew the outlet to be but could not for the life of me find the it on the wall.  I was probably there for a good few minutes feeling every inch of the wall and even places I knew it couldn't have been because I was getting so frustrated.  I finally found it after my finger poked into the socket and I got zapped.  But I swear to god that I had thoroughly checked that same spot over and over and then suddenly it just appeared and almost killed me!"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bte0n,barkface,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:40:38 2015 UTC,"You poked your finger into an outlet?    In the US fingers are too big to poke into outlets.  Even babies can't poke their fingers into outlets.    Are you in some other country where the holes in receptacles are big enough for kids' fingers to poke into?    Or was this more likely actually a false memory, or a dream?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bte0n,barkface,2,Thu Jul 2 07:15:38 2015 UTC,Definitely not a false memory.  I'm in the U.S. I didn't poke my finger all the way in but I sure as hell remember being zapped so I must have touched something somehow.  I remember my finger finding one of the plug holes and that's the precise time it happened.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bte0n,mycatisawhore,-2,Thu Jul 2 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"I believe you have a strong memory of this, but that doesn't mean it's not a false memory.  Seriously:  go to any electric wall socket (that isn't broken with some kind of opening to the interior) and try to poke your finger in.  You really really can't.    Your experience seems exactly like what a kid is afraid will happen if they poke their finger ""in"" the plug (because parents work so hard to condition their kids to be afraid of electricity), but it's not consistent with real life.    Maybe you got some kind of static shock from touching the wall, but even that is doubtful if you had been groping the wall the whole time.    For the record: even if you touched an actual live 120v wire it wouldn't feel like a shock like a static zap because it would have to travel through your body, like down through your feet into the floor, and you can actually feel the path it takes!   Unless there were random paperclips sticking poked out through the socket or something like that you really really 99.9999% likely did not get shocked by touching the receptacle.    How would you recognize a false memory with such certainty that you can say this wasn't a false memory? It seems to me like the best way is to reject memories that could more reasonably be attributed to sleep walking or that can be reasonably eliminated based on real life experiences, like trying to poke your finger in a receptacle."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bte0n,barkface,3,Thu Jul 2 17:25:09 2015 UTC,I live in the US and have poked the tip of my finger in an outlet and gotten zapped. There's a reason kid-proof caps are made for them.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bte0n,Drapetomania,-2,Thu Jul 2 17:44:01 2015 UTC,The reason is so that they don't shove objects in.    Your finger tip doesn't fit in plugs in the US.  Sorry.

I don't know what to tell ya but I wonder if you're right about building up energy from rubbing on the wall so much.  Maybe just getting my finger so close to the socket made a connection somehow."

Also, cuts on the head easily go unnoticed since it can be hard to find the cut under your hear - one time while drunk I smashed my head on the floor real bad and there was a massive pool of blood when I woke up and I literally couldn't find any wound, I remember thinking ""Shit did I stab someone or something?"" until my parents explained that I'd gotten drunk and hit my head. I found the cut later but I had to really feel my head from a very certain angle to even tell it was there.  Bleeding from the teeth/gums is also similar in that it can be very abrupt and then completely cease so for example you can brush your teeth and spit out an entire mouthful of blood only to check your mouth and find none left there and seemingly no cut - in fact tbh the teeth thing is most likely since most peoples gums aren't the healthiest and that can lead to bleeding, plus if you cough, spit etc, you'll spit some of the blood out. Happened to me before.  Just some thoughts. I feel like the best way we'll get to the bottom of the real interesting stories here and find out new things about the way our reality works is by first narrowing down and eliminating ones that are normal every day occurrences."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3br483,rmadlal,2,Thu Jul 2 07:08:14 2015 UTC,As time goes by most of your childhood memories either fade or change or both. That's what happens to memory over a long period of time. Yesterday's memory is still fresh in your mind and is much more truthful to reality because of the very short time that passed between yesterday and now. (Isn't that exactly what the sidebar is saying too? Or am I making stuff up?)
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3br483,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:36:18 2015 UTC,"Isn't that exactly what the sidebar is saying too?   Yeah, the idea behind the sidebar caution isn't just the false memory thing (because adults are just as vulnerable to ""explaining over the top of"" their memories), it's that children are especially vulnerable to misunderstanding certain things at the time - and ""falling into imagination"" and confusing it with reality. Hence no ""elves lived behind the curtains"" type stories. (Although there is a whole issue of what exactly children are experiencing when this stuff happens I suppose, but we'll never work that out.)   Yesterday's memory is still fresh in your mind and is much more truthful to reality because of the very short time that passed between yesterday and now.   What I was getting at with the question was: right now how do you tell the difference between yesterday and long ago? We can't answer in terms of time because that presumes the answer.   A memory is basically a thought that you have now that you interpret as being ""about the past"".   So I was thinking about this (feel free to skip to the end)    Most people will say that, after pondering, time seems to be mentally laid out in front of them in a line running left to right - with ""now"" being directly in front, ""the future"" to the right and ""the past"" to the left. When they think of a moment in ""the past"" they imagine it to be positioned on the line somewhere. Recent moments, being ""nearer"", tend to be clearer, other moments, being ""farther"", tend to seem more dimmer and more distant.  But all of that is a thought taking place now. Which means ""the past"" actually is nothing but a bunch of mental pictures in a line; the past is imagined, now.  The problem with this is an extra bit: Whenever you go looking for a memory, you tend to find one. There's something about the mind that automatically fills in the gaps. Every ""mental door"" you open has a room beyond it. If you woke up this morning as a ""brand new person"" out of nowhere, you'd soon have a whole bunch of memories to explain you existence.  So ""yesterday"" and ""when I was a child"" probably differ mostly in the fact that you have more evidence to create a thought ""about"" yesterday than you have to create a thought ""about"" when you were a child. Neither are trustworthy. Their apparent ""freshness"" doesn't necessarily mean anything.  The only thing you can trust is your sensory experience right now.  TL;DR: Childhood memories are imaginative. But so are those of adulthood. The only way to judge a story is its content, as if it happened ""now""."

But on the other hand there is no time, so does it make a difference? For example I'm more convincend that we can't fly as an adult than as a kid   I remember really strange things: My mom would play arround for us with a hand puppet, one day my mom wouldn't play arround with it but I still I wanted to talk to it. Suddenly the puppet was floating in mid air and talking to me.  My grandmother I never got to know, showed up one time in a blue mist when I was in bed, I had never seen a picture of her and as I asked my mother to see a picture of my grandmother I realised the blue mist was her.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3br483,mztw777,2,Thu Jul 2 08:29:35 2015 UTC,"But on the other hand there is no time, so does it make a difference?   There is no time in the sense that there is just the current experience, one part of which we call ""traces of the past"". But those traces can be interpreted as traces corresponding to  a less ""structured"" situation.   Do you think as a kid we don't have the limited beliefs of an adult?    I think our ""private views"" of the world become more solidified and more ""entangled"" with other views. We also mentally ""grasp onto"" our surroundings more tightly. I definitely think children are more flexible in terms of what they can perceive and what they can do.  Lots of stories here and elsewhere suggest that being in remote places or being detached and daydreamy tends to make unusual and more dreamlike experiences more likely. Surely children spend more time  being ""remote"" and daydreamy than anyone else?  People who go on meditation retreats ofter report that after a while their dreams seem more solid than their waking life, which becomes more ""transparent"". I wonder if that's an effect of not having their usual limitations ""re-triggered"" by everyday interactions? Is the solidity of our world more to do with habit than of any underlying rules?  Something that could be experimented with. Problem is, just because you get flexible enough to perhaps do something, doesn't mean others are flexible enough to have you do it (if that makes sense)."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bonka,Khavi,4,Wed Jul 1 03:16:05 2015 UTC,"The ""quantum suicide"" thing really just says that your experience always continues, that there's always a next-moment. You are ""a conscious perspective having a particular experience"", currently a being-a-person-in-a-world experience, moment by moment. That consciousness cannot end. The theory doesn't specify the content of any next-moment though.  So if you die of old age or a car crash that you don't ""reset"" from, then you'll experience ""something else"" afterwards, depending on what makes sense.  Maybe you'll experience ""floating up from your body and entering a mystical land"". Or maybe you'll experience ""being reborn"".

We can never know for certain without having had the experience ourselves. But...  We can surely glean a little bit from NDEs and other stories on this subreddit and elsewhere:   If people don't report a time-reset, or have an unlikely avoidance, or a strange discontinuity - they tend to report an out-of-body experience sometimes accompanied by a ""journey"", which they then snap back from. If they didn't ""come back"" we might presume that this experience would continue to wherever it leads. The experiences are sometimes religious but most often not. Maybe it's just more dream.  Whether their experience follows from a world logic (an independent truth) or their logic (their own expectations and beliefs and observations-to-date) would be the interesting thing. Maybe even having the concept of ""quantum suicide"" influences what happens when you hit a certain-death moment....  EDIT: This whole thing gets a lot simpler if, rather than hypothesising relentless splittings and creations, we just declare that every conscious being lives in their own ""private view"". A view which may or may not overlap sometimes with other views."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bonka,TriumphantGeorge,11,Wed Jul 1 12:09:54 2015 UTC,"This post just reminded me of a theory I've held for quite some time. It's not exactly what you are thinking but I have always believed that suicide results in being sent back to do it all again. I would accept that that could include continuing on where you left off in another universe. Whereas living life to its natural conclusion permits you to move on to the next stage of existence, whatever that is."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bonka,BenjaminDurassova,8,Tue Jun 30 23:44:48 2015 UTC,"There was a post on this subreddit earlier about someone who committed suicide and simply woke up again the next day as if nothing happened except some things changed as if he had moved into a different but very similar universe. I think it all very much depends on the person what will happen, every soul has a unique path to follow and certain lessons to learn. Some will be moved into a parallel reality and continue their life, some will be sent back in time to live their life all over again and others will reincarnate into a new body, perhaps not even a human body. If the person who commits suicide has already learned the lesson they were supposed to learn I think it's possible they don't have to continue or live the same life again. But that's just my theory."

Basically, you don't ""hop over"" anywhere, what shifts is your experience. You need to view other people as 'Extended Persons' where you see one aspect of all their possibilities at any one time.  On The ""Sharing Model"" Of The World  You are not a person, you are a conscious space having a ""person-perspective experience"" - senses, perceptions, thoughts, floating in awareness. The ""person"" you are might be considered as The First Tulpa.  Meanwhile, it is just not possible to conceive in thought of the way in which there is overlap between apparent perspectives. It is not a ""simply-shared"" world model. The other people in your experience are your aspects of those people - and the ""you"" you experience is similarly an aspect of that idea.  Often people talk about a ""consensus reality"" as if it's a bunch of people in a room, choosing the decor together. In fact, it's more like everyone has their own room, choosing versions of the other people and the decor. In fact, it's even more like everyone is a room, and is choosing versions of themselves and other people and the decor. In fact again, not even a room because the room represents time and space, which are themselves ""contextual formatting"" within you...  you get the idea...  And ""idea"" is the key word. People are ""ideas"" or patterns, and it is those ideas which appear in your experience. ""You"" are just an idea you have associated with yourself.

Unfortunately, I can't quite remember the author or title. It was in a sci-fi anthology, I believe. One of those Nebula Award collections or just a ""year's best"" volume.  In the short story, the protagonist went through a series of progressively closer brushes with death. IIRC, at the start, he was dying of some heart ailment. But in his last week of life, there was a medical breakthrough that cured him. Then there was some more direct threat to his life that was somehow averted.  With each ""near miss"", he found small details in his world would change like the title or contents of a book. Or chapter texts would meld between his current and previous worlds.  In addition, because the probabilites had to become increasingly skewed to allow him to ""survive"", his experienced world became stranger and stranger.  I think at one point an asteroid was going to annihilate Earth, and at another point aliens made first contact.  Anyways, has anyone else heard of this story?

You basically imagine other people, based on a few electronic signals producing colour, sound, texture. You never know what's really out there... Pretty grim!  The scary thing about a simulation would be if it was being run like a literal computer simulation - in other words, someone could trip over a cable and end it all. But really that's just a silly version of the idea, based on our technology fantasies.  The most freeing idea is actually the Quantum Immortality thing, because In order to work it means everything is made from ""consciousness"" - basically it's like a shared dreams where we only imagine the limitations and decisions we experience, and we are not separate at all."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bonka,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you go with the ""standard explanation"" you are probably forced to go with the idea that a certain part of the brain somewhere that is the ""conscious viewer"". Which is quite a problem. It's one of the reasons that the ""emergent consciousness"" hope for brain isn't a good one. You still eventually have the problem of answering: what is it about this part of the brain that means it is conscious?  If we want to stay brain-based, then research into memory (which can find no location for memories) tends towards us being ""the whole system"". There have been cases of people being able to control their hearts, other functions, and so on - it's probably not that we can't, it's that those things are very much in the background of your experience, almost like (looping back here) a deeply buried memory.  The alternative to all of this is to flip it around and start with the subjective experience (which we do anyway, we just pretend that we don't). In that case, brains and bodies become the ""images"" that correspond to conscious entities. The brains we see inside people are just ""visual representations"" of an aspect of a consciosu being. This representation doesn't actually do anything though! Brains don't cause anything.  It's like when we see a TV show with two CGI monsters fighting. Those two monster-shaped images aren't actually doing anything. We might say that the images ""represent"" two monsters flighting, but the true reality that the images point to is: a small group of designers spending a few thousand hours in front of expensive computers in an office somewhere, drinking lots of coffee. That is the true nature of the monsters onscreen.  TL;DR: Brains are like Godzilla vs Megazord."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bonka,Aroha11,2,Thu Jul 2 18:07:14 2015 UTC,"While I'm totally of the belief that what you say does happen, I disagree that it's called Quantum suicide.

From your perspective you just successfully avoid/ survive anything that could kill you.  There is still a probability structure here. So you're more likely to survive a heart attack by being resuscitated than by being reincarnated into an eagle. Also your continued existence won't necessarily be pleasent,  QI doesn't rule out severe brain damage or paralysis for instance."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bonka,samamp,2,Wed Jul 1 11:15:43 2015 UTC,"So you're more likely to survive a heart attack by being resuscitated than by being reincarnated into an eagle.    How can we compute the probability structure to work out what's more likely? Cos I dunno, there seems to be a lot of eagles in the world, and a lot of people do apparently die from heart attacks.   Maybe most heart attack victims become eagles.  Or maybe you just become whatever there is a need for at the moment, and if all positions are full only then do you get to continue on as your human self!  EDIT: Although the comment is jokey, the question of computing ""liklihood"" is serious. We can only talk about how ""likely"" something is if we can gather data by making observations. We just can't do that here. So ""likely"" doesn't mean ""probable"" in the computed sense; it just means ""more plausible to us as a story, given our lack of knowledge""."

But really Occam is for predictive models and it says that you should use no more conceptual entities than are required to make predictions.   Without this, the word ""simplest"" in this context doesn't really mean anything! Meanwhile, Occam doesn't care about ""understandability"" other than this; but this is exactly what we care about.  It's another one of those areas a phrase has a narrow meaning in science which differs from the broad everyday meaning (like with ""theory"", ""law"", ""mass"", etc).   In these discussion we're not talking about a tight mathematical or conceptual model. We can't make pre-planned observations, so we can't establish the concepts, so we can't make predictions, so we can't test. Really, we are making metaphors to help us think about the phenomenon; ways of looking."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bonka,Mattya929,2,Wed Jul 1 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"This question was asked before, so I will be repeating myself :-)   I think there is no reason to assume that there is one rule that applies always, and to everyone.  You may re-set quantum immortality style 11 times, and the 12th time reincarnate. Or go to higher dimension. Or to heaven. Or wherever and whenever. You may be re-born to the past, as your grandfather, or in the future, as a child in Mongolia. Or you may go elsewhere.   There is a variety in life, why shouldn't there be variety in death? Just because someone re-sets once, it doesn't mean it will happen again, or will happen to a different person. There may be many, many options: if something is true (we speculate here), it doesn't necessarily have to be true in all cases and instances ALL THE TIME. You are looking for a rule, but why should there be any?   There are, for example, different educational paths on Earth - depending on the country, education system, times, people's intelligence, interests, available opportunities and options, people may take various very different routes: it may be the same with death. If we think about the development of the soul using this kind of comparison, it is easy to imagine there is an almost infite number of paths a soul can take, depending on a multitude of factors, goals, circumstances etc. Therefore not everyone who dies may go through quantum immportality thingy, and not everyone who went through it before may experience it again."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bonka,MonkeyNacho,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:45:29 2015 UTC,"So, the only rule is:   Consciousness goes on, so there's always a next-moment of experience, of some sort.   There are no limitations on the form consciousness can take, what ""shape of experience"" it can adopt. It needn't even necessarily be a continuous experience; at any point we might decide to wipe past memories and ""refresh"".   Progression could be like: accident resets, narrow escapes, spontaneous reality-shifts, the discovery of intentional reality-shifts, getting bored, memory wipe, new dream."

It worked and I woke up to the sound of my gasping.   I don't remember why it was urgent that I wake up. I think either something dangerous was happening in the dream like an attack or rape , or I was worried about what was going on in the real world.

We all go into paralysis during sleep, to protect us from hurting ourselves while unconscious / dreaming. The breathing pathways are the only part of the body that doesn't get paralyzed. Either hyperventilating, or not breathing at all, seem like reliable ways to wake up.  This is also how sleep apnea hurts you. If you stop breathing while sleeping, the brain momentarily wakes you up, interrupting paralysis and the repair processes that the body was doing. Repeat that many times a night, and you wake up exhausted..."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3blk46,TriumphantGeorge,2,Tue Jun 30 22:02:03 2015 UTC,"It sorta depends on whether holding your dream breath has an influence on your waking body's breath. I've held my breath in dreams for ages (underwater exploration) and it's not woken me up.  I think it has more to do with the intention that breath-holding will lead to waking up, rather than a certain connection between the two. (Although breath and eye movement do seem to be good ways to intentionally communicate to ""the outside"".)  Sleep apnea sounds pretty grim!"

I have been fortunate in that, for the most part, they have been the scripted movie type of dream, complete with a story arc, a few twists, and a somewhat satisfying ending. One began in the ocean, which ended up being the flooded Earth, and all kinds of crazy shit happened involving aliens, mind control, and mer-people. Another involved my working with friends to dig a mine, and happening across enormous intricate tunnel systems in the Earth that were inhabited by bugs who were not pleased to have been disturbed. Only a few have been the terrifying, introspective kind, where everything is just slightly off and your brain seems to be against you. The dreams where all of life seems to be only a self-contained memory, rife with the strange melancholy of predestination and that strange hidden knowledge we seem to acquire about our surroundings.

I started having these kinds of dreams a few years ago and they were really scary at first. i have kind of learned to be more comfortable with them and just go with it when something unnerving happens. However, i recently had a dream like this at night and it scared me a lot. Like you, i kept feeling like i was waking up in slightly different realities. I felt like there was someone in my bed with me and i could not get them out. After feeling like i woke up maybe three times, i actually woke up. When i blinked and looked around i could kind of see a set of eyes looking at me. This scared me too. This was probably similar to you seeing patterns on the wall.

If you learn how to control it you can turn it into lucid dream but that is super tough.   More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis  This is the ELI5 of what is happening during sleep paralysis. During deep sleep (REM sleep) when you dream, you're brain paralyses your muscles so that you do not enact your dreams. If you enacted your dreams while sleeping you could really hurt yourself. Sleep paralysis occurs when your mind wakes up but your body has yet to receive that signal from the brain. Essentially all your muscles are locked (except involuntary stuff like breathing) but you know your awake. It causes a helpless and vulnerable feeling which often leads to images of and visions of terror or evil.   Sometimes when I get it my brain tricks myself into thinking that I've woken up only to realize that I am still asleep. Sometime the cycle goes on like 5 times before I eventually get out of it."

Sometimes dreams are dedicated to explaining a problem and other times a voice interrupts the dream and says something then I wake.  I pay very close attention to my dreams.  Usually a dream will explain something that bothers me or information I want to know or its a warning to prepare myself for a very negative event.

Suspend your curiosity:  Broome didn't invent the experience, or even the concept - she just coined the term ""Mandela Effect"", attributed it to a vague half-arsed reality-effect idea based on others, and went all out with it.  As far as online documentation of these sorts of things go, Cynthia Sue Larson has been running her Realityshifters.com since the late 1990s, for instance, with far better coverage. And in paper-book-world the idea is very old indeed.  If his book was called The Mandela Effect and was a nonfiction documentation of the phenomenon, then of course that might be different.

I think it brought these ideas to lots of people. And it can get quite meta sometimes. Philip K Dick's novels do this very well also. (And check out his How To Build A Universe essay if you haven't.)  Yeah, I'd like to read a good well-researched novel incorporating these ideas and their historical versions. I'd slightly caution against going with a straightforward ""clueless guy who find out the world isn't what it seems"" angle, if you can find another way in, because it's been done to death by dozens of films and TV series now. Presume some of it and have things be revealed by action rather than explanation where possible.   If you haven't seen Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, that might be interesting for imagery inspiration if you end up doing some historical stuff..."

Probably not, because I don't recall ever soul gazing, but yesterday I read a story about someone who by coincidence had  the opportunity to soul gaze with Chopra. I don't recall the last time that I saw anything about soul gazing, if ever I had. I just thought that it was a handy plot device for this comment.  Cynthia Sue Larson's realityshifters.com was in my awareness at the very beginning of my recent and continuing four week long cluster of synchronicity. Considering my admiration for your contribution to this and other subreddits your reference to Larson is messing with my head.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bdzgp,TriumphantGeorge,3,Sun Jun 28 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although that kind of misses the point I think.   The concept is only that experience always persists, because (conceptually) there will always be a probability path in which you didn't die (whether by suicide, or in that car accident, or whatever). Macroscopic/microscopic is neither here nor there; it's not literally a quantum mechanical process.  Just as the ""Many Worlds"" interpretation of quantum mechanics itself isn't very scientific (I mean, how exactly? How to falsify?) neither is this - it's more like a metaphor to account for certain experiences. It's not really a debunkable concept, in the same way."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bdzgp,Scroon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:03:00 2015 UTC,"Also, quantum effects have been observed on a molecular scale, meaning quantum effects do not necessarily break down at a macroscopic scale - which is what I think that post was arguing."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bdzgp,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"Yes.   The root situation is in any case: that mathematically (and quantum mechanics is only a mathematical theory, the rest is just made-up stories) several states are possible for a measurement.  In terms of ""quantum suicide"" (or many-worlds on a macro level), anything beyond that level of fuzziness would be inherently not observable - because you would be in one state or the other.   You can't measure the fuzziness of your own macro state, but this does not mean there is no set of states which you can shift between. It just means you can't detect the available set of states from within one of the states, except at the micro level because you do not in fact make micro-observations in general.  (Apologies - that was probably very poorly worded.)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bdzgp,Scroon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:48:27 2015 UTC,"How about this wording:  Our ""awareness"" can be defined as specific and instantaneous observations of multitudinous and shifting quantum states. We cannot observe this multiplicity because our awareness is dependent on the selection of one defined state. However, we can conduct experiments that provide evidence that these simultaneous states do occur by creating macroscopically defined quantum states that could have only arisen through some sort of simultaneous multiplicity.  Hmm...that's somewhat wordy as well."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bdzgp,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:06:20 2015 UTC,"Close! I think though  I'd want to start by separating our ""awareness"" (the conscious space that we are)  and the content of awareness, ""awareness of"" (the experiences or ""sensory facts/observations"" that appear in it).  In fact maybe begin with the definition: We are the conscious perceiving space in which our experiences appear.  Have you read Marcus Arvan's Peer-2-Peer Simulation Hypothesis paper? Ignore the ""simulation"" and just think ""information"" but it's not a bad metaphor, for communication. It's effectively ""cross communication between Imagination Rooms"", in my metaphor."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bdzgp,Scroon,2,Wed Jul 1 08:21:13 2015 UTC,"Haven't read Arvan, but I will now. Looks interesting.  EDIT: Read the summary. Wish I had free access to the paper. Generally, the argument is compelling. It's the shared reality/dream concept (that I'm partial to) constructed around a P2P metaphor. I do think quantum indeterminancy and collapse are pretty well explained by the idea that ""stuff"" needs to exist in a flexible form across the P2P network unless one peer defines it through measurement. It makes observational influence and effects a trivial part of the system rather than semi-mystical quantum hocus pocus. Also, entanglement makes sense over an information network rather than a purely physical one.  Personally, I've been thinking more and more that this ""reality"" is some type of shared creative experience with rules. We can affect reality through intention (to what degree?) but we must also rectify our experience with our ""peers"" as well as the established physical laws. Other than that through ""radomness"" or flexibility in others' perceptions, we can manage our experience to a great degree. Just my current thinking.  Two asides:  1) This was linked in the Arvan article. Microtubules as quantum devices? Perhaps our brains are a kind of quantum tuning device? http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm  2) Do you know about the Hindu concept of Yugas? I've read that in the Satya Yuga (Golden Age) human work is supposed to be accomplished through will or spirit alone - basically through intention. Currently, we are supposed to be living in the lowest age (Kali Yuga) where work must be accomplished through physical effort of the body. Interesting correlation with some of our discussions."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bdzgp,Kafke,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:13:15 2015 UTC,"Not really a debunking.  The idea remains the same. If quantum immortality is feasible (and correct), then the same concept would apply in general to the subjective experience, not just when it's dependent on quantum decoherence."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bdzgp,luiting57,3,Tue Jun 30 08:08:31 2015 UTC,This would explain what happened to me. I was drinking one night in a trailer park and tried to drive home. It was morning and I was so drunk I couldn't drive. As I pulled out of the park I heard a horn and turned to see a car ten feet from the passenger side going at a rapid speed and about to t-bone my car.  The next thing I knew I was in the parking lot of my apartment building in the passenger side of the car waking up.  The car about to t-bone me had no time to even veer off of the road. How I got home is another story since I have no memory of driving. I can only assume the car vanished and I continued driving home in a blackout. Why I woke up on the passenger side is also a mystery. Needless to say I quit drinking soon after that.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bd7jl,NorthBlizzard,2,Sun Jul 5 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure. But over a lifetime of exposure, could be any or all of the above: fillings, eating fish/tuna, potentially trace amounts used in preservatives of vaccines."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bd7jl,dummyreplicant,11,Tue Jul 7 06:37:02 2015 UTC,"I think I've had similar experiences. Never really talked about this before. But twice in my life I've had a dream of the same woman, dark hair, tannish skin. Just downright beautiful, the closest I could say is like Mila Kunis, but more hispanic or ethnic. The first dream I was a teenager, and we were talking in a field. She had sort of a motherly feeling to her then, a caring but not romantic feeling. We were laying down talking, then she got up and picked me up. She hugged me for a minute then I woke up. The second dream I had of her was in my early 20s, and it was much more romantic. We had a lot of adventures in the dream, like going places. I can't recall them, because I was staring at her too much in my dream, like I was in amazement. We eventually made love, then we were staring at eachother. She became sad, and said something like ""we can't meet eachother again here."" I got very sad, then I looked into her eyes once more. She then began to dissapear, with a sad look in her eyes too. I woke up, and just began crying. I felt like my heart had been broken, like waking up to news of a loved one's death. It makes me wonder, if maybe she is my soulmate, but maybe her spirit never made it here. Or maybe she died as a kid, or too early for us to meet. Both times I dreamt of her, I woke up crying as if something had been torn from me."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bd7jl,dummyreplicant,7,Sun Jun 28 16:03:02 2015 UTC,"Crazy... sad, too... it's interesting you mention that. I had a similar recurring dream as a child. I would find myself in an airy room with an older woman. Similar physically to who you've described. I remember, she was always wearing a white, silk nightgown in all the dreams. I have to say, I think the women I've described above COULD be the same women. She was older. And maybe the only women I knew who wore vintage white nightgowns out, regularly. Thanks for the story."

In the dream he was around three years old, and he was running around me as I sat picking dandelions with a girl who seemed about a year old. I knew she was my daughter. She looked exactly like I did at that age. It was such a vivid dream that I missed her, and even mourned her for a few days after the dream. My husband and I were no where close to even talking about a second child since we had a newborn.   Shortly after my son's first birthday, we found out I was pregnant. Something we hadn't planned. (I was told I would need fertility treatments to get pregnant again, so we weren't very careful.) We had a girl, which makes my son and daughter two years apart, just like my dream. She also looks exactly like I did as a kid too. The funny thing is that I had completely forgotten about the dream. It wasn't until months after my daughter was born that I read through an old journal of mine, where I wrote about missing my nonexistent daughter."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bcnmr,RadOwl,21,Sun Jun 28 10:46:23 2015 UTC,"As a moderator at /r/dreams I have run across a number of reports about dreaming about children before they are born--even before they are conceived. People who don't understand the nature of space-time say it's impossible, but in the quantum world particles go forward and backward in time. Time is not on a linear path. I think that events such as having children are determined at a deeper level of reality that is outside of space-time, but I digress.  Most dreams about having children are symbolism for the idea of giving birth something new. I recently helped someone understand a dream about being pregnant with five babies, and it turned out the dreamer was busy with five projects at her job training."

There are longer excerpts of this talk on Youtube, and his book ""Holographic Universe"" is the bomb. ""Thinking Allowed"" is also an awesome resource.  Fred Alan Wolf is another great resource.  This video explains how particles go forward and backward in time.  This is the dream about five babies.  Start there. If you dig it, hit me back and I'll give you more."

If you can summon the strength, the sequence in that discussion where they talk about condensing the information in a room into a 3D diagram, and then a 2D diagram, is quite interesting.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bcnmr,RadOwl,2,Mon Jun 29 02:37:46 2015 UTC,"From philosopher Immanuel Kant, we have the notion of the phenomenal and the nuomenal. Basically, we come to the idea that time and space are the formattings of the mind. They are part of your senses rather than part of the world. The universe is more akin to an infinite gloop, and we build a world from the accumulation of observations (""facts"")."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bcnmr,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:46:49 2015 UTC,"That jives with FA Wolf's explanation. Time and space are created by consciousness in order to have an immersive experience. Our accumulation of observations and experiences shapes how we process the world.  Example: Recently I saw something out of the corner of my eye that I thought at first was my cat. Before turning my head and fully focusing on the object I ""saw"" in my mind the fully formed image of my cat. Turned out, it was a pair of sandals with roughly the same coloration and outline of my cat when she lays on the floor.  Experiences like that have made realize my brain creates my perceptions of the world based on expectation. Usually the assumptions it makes are correct. But it has taught me is it's not just my sensory world that my brain does this trick with, but also my inner world. I think that is what Terrence McKenna means by ""cultural operating system."" It's our programming."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bcnmr,RadOwl,2,Mon Jun 29 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"It's pretty fascinating. I call it ""human-formatting"" because it appears in a background of being-aware, it seems - we think of ourselves as being brains and so on, but our observations about brains already take place after they have been subject to our mind-formatting. Our whole investigate endeavour occurs inside the mind even though we then try to theorise impossibly about what's outside of that. Conundrum fun!  This post has some examples I came across about the seeing-things-is-imagining-them thing."

First thing that came to mind was that I used to do the same thing to get trashed at parties. Second thing to come to mind is that she looks a lot like my little sister and my girlfriend mixed together. When I approached her, she told me I already knew her. During mid-conversation, her phone rings and she picks it up--it's her mom. After a few seconds, she held the phone out and side her mom wanted to speak to me. When I took it, the voice on the phone said ""Wake up, I'm going to work"" and she sounded like my girlfriend--only different, I guess older? At that moment, I woke up to my girlfriend brushing her teeth for work. I'm thoroughly convinced that girl was my daughter, because in the dream she mentioned ""Time is an illusion"". That's something I've been focusing on a lot lately and it almost seemed like she was reassuring me."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bcnmr,thatvirginia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:38:21 2015 UTC,"I got my manuscripts confused. Your anecdote is used in an upcoming book. Here is what I wrote, beginning with the subsection heading. The reference to the horse race is from the previous section, a documented case of a guy dreaming multiple times about the winners of horse races:  We first met in a dream  What if it wasn't a horse race your dreams showed you ahead of time, but your children or siblings? You know names, faces, genders, personalities. The details not only match, the feelings that accompany these dreams are unmistakable. One person I talked to remembered a dream about his four siblings that showed them together at his grandma's house, but he was an only child at the time. Many years after the dream he sat in his grandma's living room with his four siblings across from him exactly as the dream pictured. It showed him facts about their gender and appearance, the layout of the living room, that they'd all taken off their shoes at the front door and hopped on two couches, himself on one couch and his four siblings on the other.  An extraordinary coincidence, faulty memory, or even wishful thinking could be at work here, but other details from the dream report persuade the skeptic in me to give it a rest. When the guy realized he was living in the moment foretold by his dreams, he says he “immediately had the weirdest feeling, not deja vu but something more – weird and different. It kind of felt like a feeling that started from my lower back and went up my spine into my brain. I closed my eyes for a second, opened them, and I was in the exact same moment that I had dreamed about 15 years ago.” That's not a garden variety feeling of deja vu. It's unmistakable."

Whether we pay attention to it is another matter however. So in my opinion, this isn't so much a glitch as much as an interesting phenomenon of human physiology.  Internally, you knew that you were supposed to get up at 6:00, so your subconscious manifested that dream image of a girl pushing you in order to get you out of bed.  I've had lots of times myself when I wake up right before my alarm clock. And I know my cat gets up at the same time every night even though I don't think he can read time."

He, being a nice guy, wanted to get up without setting an alarm and waking me up. He later told me that as he was falling asleep, he was looking at his watch and picturing an alarm clock going off at 5:00.  He said that he was in the middle of a dream, and it was abruptly interrupted by a big image of an alarm clock going off, and he woke up. Impressed by the power of his own mind, he snuck out of the tent and got ready to head out. When he noticed that it was still surprisingly dark, he checked his watch and saw...3:30."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bc0gf,BadAdviceBot,2,Mon Jun 29 00:45:32 2015 UTC,"This happened with a movie I owned (Waking Life.) One day there were two copies. I asked all my friends if they owned a copy, and tried to find the owner for a few months. All my friends found their movie immediately and proved they had it. Eventually I just gave it to my sister. No idea where it came from, and even more puzzling, is why I would borrow a movie I already owned?  The only explanation I have is that someone must have visited me, and used my computer DVD tray to watch a movie with me, and happened to bring their own copy and didn't tell me?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bc0gf,Funfun4every1,2,Tue Jun 30 01:08:18 2015 UTC,"Seems like this is a pretty common thing with CD based media. Whether it be a DVD, music or a game. That definitely is really strange, I wish there was some kind of thing we could investigate and figure out where the second copies come from and why they appear."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bc0gf,Funfun4every1,2,Tue Jun 30 01:19:34 2015 UTC,"And the weird thing about CDs and movies, etc. is that people usually want them in their collections, and have a place set aside. It's rather easy to know if your copy is missing. My sister also had a duplicate show up (she asked me if I owned a copy, and I already did) and to this day she now has two copies. I am a bit of a skeptic, so I can't say much about her experience, but I know it is weird when it happens, and like you said... it is not an isolated event."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bc0gf,LightUpThe-Night,3,Tue Jun 30 07:22:13 2015 UTC,This is a lame glitch. Come on. There is nothing here that shows that. The barcodes are all the same on all the boxes. The only thing that would make it true is if the CD KEY was there and both were the same. I call that you are trolling.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bc0gf,xpenvex,2,Sun Jun 28 06:49:35 2015 UTC,"The glitch is that there is a second copy that appeared from nowhere; the barcode being identical isn't the glitch, that's just part of the packaging."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3bc0gf,OmegaX123,0,Sun Jun 28 18:05:41 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly, the barcode isn't the glitch or the first thing I looked at. It was the fact that a second copy of the game just appeared from nowhere as you said. I just thought it was a weird they matched, I know nothing about barcodes. That solves one mystery but not the other."

I don't know anyone else in person who plays CS:S with a box to compare to and even if they all match (which I doubt), this second copy still came out of absolutely nowhere.   If I had both CD KEYs I would still censor them because one is obviously unused. Maybe the duplication can't create a second CD KEY but can create everything else? Maybe there's not a second CD KEY because it IS a duplicate and it's trolling me?"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3b9h6l,badassgirl,64,Sat Jun 27 02:11:13 2015 UTC,"He was just speaking with her on the phone...he's pretty shaken up right now actually. She said it could have been one of his father's employees at the time but couldn't be sure since it was so long ago. He owned a small local grocery store so it wasn't unusual for him to call his employees himself if he needed someone to pick up an extra shift.  I think it's mostly strange because the phone numbers for VA and NH are so different. The area codes are not easily confused. Also, in 1990 I don't think he would have needed to use an area code to call locally...at least I know we didn't have to until I was at least 7 or 8 in my area. I don't know why he would have dialed a 10 digit number or why he would have given my grandmother a full 10 digit number"

Crazily enough, the popularity of Annabelle really was very low in 1990 in the US: the 1904th most popular name with only 1 in 26,000 people taking that name.  The popularity has since risen sharply to 57th most popular.  So the chances of that phone number being called were either really low or... really high. Really low in that, at random, the chance of calling any particular house and there being an Annabelle there (kinda) is small.  However, if, somehow, your name was already decided and had somehow leaked out into the public sphere with your grandparents details then the chance of calling that number given that you were looking for an Annabelle is actually quite high. How such details could end up available ahead of your birth is another matter, especially before the Web really came along."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3b7d51,LordStryker,13,Fri Jun 26 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"Your story reminds me of something similar that happened to me a few months back.   I woke up one morning and headed into my spare bedroom that I have set up as an office. I keep my pc on top of a glass desk and I have a leather swivel chair in front. As I pulled out my chair to sit, I heard a little sloshing noise and felt something wet. I looked, and all this water had pooled in the folds of the top of my chair. I looked further and realized water was all over the top of my desk as well.   I chalked it up to if there were perhaps a leak in the ceiling. So I looked up to see if there was a ceiling stain, but there was nothing. I then stood on top of the chair to actually feel if the ceiling was damp, but it was completely dry. And yet, there was all this fresh water all over the place.  I also live alone, and I always lock my doors so it isn't like someone came over and dumped water on my chair. I didn't have any glasses of water sitting on my desk from the night before either. I asked my fiancé if he knew anything about it and he was as much at a loss as I was. I just shrugged it off as random condensation accumulating but now that u mention this similar occurrence, maybe there's something more weird to it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3b7d51,feverbug,5,Fri Jun 26 19:17:25 2015 UTC,"Condensation is also something I considered but only very briefly.  Given the amount of water in my pile of socks, it would have to be LOT of condensation.  This truly is weird."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3b7d51,feverbug,5,Fri Jun 26 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Plus, why would it be concentrated in just that one little corner and no where else?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3b7d51,Dvart,4,Fri Jun 26 19:20:34 2015 UTC,Bingo.  Plus the fact that there was no pool-age of water on top of the bin!
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3b7d51,ohheyimluke,16,Fri Jun 26 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of something that happened a few years ago.  When I was home on break from college one summer I would wake up and would find various things of mine soaking wet, a shirt on the floor, one blanket etc. Was very odd with no explanation.  Finally one morning my dad let me know that he woke up at 4:30 and I was in the bathroom filling up the small garbage can we have there with water, and after asking me ""what are you doing?"" it was clear that I was sleepwalking. The funny thing is I started drinking more water and it stopped. Seems like my sleeping self was hinting I was dehydrated."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3b7d51,ohheyimluke,29,Sat Jun 27 01:05:34 2015 UTC,"This kind of thing has happened to a friend of mine before. He woke up one morning, there was water all over his table, and some inside of closed jars. There was no explanation. But, after reading an interesting book called The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot, and another called The Source Field Investigations by David Wilcock, I've chalked it up to natural wormhole.  Now, I know how that sounds, but hear me out. There was a chapter in one of these books about poltergeist events (sorry, I can't remember which. I was reading them at the same time). It was interesting, because apparently there is a higher number of occurrences of these happenings in certain geographical locations all over the planet, I think some 26(?) specific places in all. But things like this do happen all over the world, just in less frequency. Now, I know what you're thinking, ""Really? First wormholes, now poltergeists?"" I'm going somewhere with this, I swear.   The common symptoms of a ""poltergeist"" sighting include, but are not limited to: your traditional movement/floating of physical objects, gravitational anomalies, and the appearance of a foreign substance (salt, fish, frogs, and water are most common).   What was theorized, it's that these ""poltergeist"" happenings were actually natural wormholes opening and connecting one point in space and time to another. There are many cases of fishfalls, where hundreds or thousands of fish fall from one point in the air over places quite far away from where the fish originate. Frogs appearing inside of rocks, and still being alive when the rock is cracked open. Water appearing in places that make no sense.  These occurrences come in all shapes and sizes. They can be large enough for hundreds of fish to go through and just small enough for a grain of salt.  I'm sure this sounds like a bunch of hokey nonsense, but it's actually a very interesting, well documented experience. I'll provide some links in a following comment, if you're interested.   (edit: added a small paragraph.)"

Also, when I removed the socks from their location, the top of the plastic bin was not inundated with any fluid.  It was wet simply from wet socks sitting there.

Do you keep a supply of ice in your freezer?  If someone (i.e. sleepwalking you) placed several ice cubes in your pile of socks, when the ice melted it could leave the circumstances you describe - little to no water anywhere else, but soaking wet socks.  I think you need to find a way to test yourself for sleepwalking.  Set up a camera maybe?"

It was a weird power trip thing I guess, he never tried to sexually assault anyone (that they know of anyway), he was a handsome junior high wrestling coach, which makes it even more unsettling. He got caught when 4 girls who were at his house crashed their car but swore to police they had only had one drink at his house.

All the versions of us that exist in alternate realities are aspects of ourselves. All the versions of us that exist in what we think of as future are already parts of us, too.

I think they've honoured the ""contract with the viewer"" so far. Whenever I've been uncertain, they've come through.

Also, there's no reason why other ""consciousnesses"" can't be looking through other NPCs. However the behaviour of an NPC does not depend on it being so experienced.

Your family and friends and loved ones mourn you, but their lives go on.  Then in your ""alternate"" timeline, you're alive, and copies of everyone are made. The ""originals"" are still in the original timeline, but there are just clones of everyone else in the alternate one. Think like the teleporter problem, if you completely rebuild every atom the exact same way on the other side, then transfer every thought, feeling, emotion, and memory to the new body, is it still you? To the clone, they went through the portal no problem. They remember everything up to it, they remember going through and coming out, they feel like the same person as you...but the real you is dead, replaced by a marionette that simply believes it's you, and acts like you. No one else would know the difference, but is it really you? That's how I see these ""NPCs"". Simply clones with memories and personalities transplanted.  I suppose in that case, everyone since my first ever close call and timeline split is an NPC, but really I only think of them that way right after a (hypothetical) ""jump"". But after a while, the feeling fades, because you can't tell the difference from my perspective, so it shouldn't really matter to me."

Science wants to be free of myth, yet it sets up its own. Only science’s myths lack all of those qualities that give men hope, zest, cheer, or faith, by denying not only the meaning of man's universe but of his very being, reducing his world to a spiritual and psychic vacuum, shoving man out of his own experience and diminishing his sense of stature by denying the events of his psyche.  -- The Worldview of William James, by Jane Roberts"

Had one moment myself after crossing at the top of the hill on a long road, a stupid idea, and seconds after reaching the other side an idiot speeds past. I had similar feelings and thoughts, ""What if I'm just the ghost now?"" and so on. I pinch myself a bunch of times.  The best answer to this though is if you can even think about this and pinch yourself and can be current then there's the biggest chance you are here, present.  My thought is that if there's nothing after death then if you were dead there'd be nothing, just blank. And that's an okay thought when thinking of if you're currently here or not, the only other option is for you to not be able to question your mortality cos you wouldn't be able to if you were dead. Makes sense, right?  But you can also let those thoughts and other pathways/routes and so on do their own thing, they'll play out, but won't have to interact with the current, with the now. The important thing is that you keep doing what you're doing with the present, but acknowledge that you had those sensations.  Edit: My story ends thus, I meditated, became more current and present with myself, connected with as many senses as I could, then aligned with my values and worked on things that linked up with those. As I continued to do this over the next few weeks I began to sew myself back into this bit of time in a sense, I was very present, and to this day I know I'm here."

We never experience our own death, but anyone else in existence could experience you dying if it meant that it would cause them to change their behavior so that they live to the natural end of their own life. The second part of this belief was that, all of the close calls you have ever encountered, and all of those alternate scenarios that you've ever thought of, are paths through life where your life comes to an end early.  Perhaps you are feeling those paths more, because they are grouped together. This must be a dark time in your life. Maybe your ""haze"" is a branch in the path of your life where you decided to act upon suicidal thoughts. Maybe you did hit that pole and die in another branching path. Since you have to live your life to your old age demise, you are still alive, but you felt the path change because you have done it so many times in succession. Since your girlfriend is close to you and would be deeply affected by your death, maybe she felt it to.

I just discovered this sub today, and no offense at all, but I'm not quite sure how much of it is roleplaying (like nosleep), how much of it is hand-waving mumbo-jumbo, how many people have legitimate stories and insight, how many people believe that we're actually all aliens, and how many people are just regular old people like me who have had something legitimately and deeply worrying happen to them and are looking for help.

That sub is different. Holding a candle up in a pitch black room in a mirror seems bad. Wrong. Evil. That is not something I want to pursue, for I am afraid of what I might see in the mirror. Those who chase monsters must first look to themselves, so as to not become the monsters themselves. For when you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back. Not an exact quote, but the message stands. I've heard enough stories to know that playing God with your own soul is never a good idea.

This can rectify the apparently deterministic cause and effect of classical physics with our belief that we have some sort of independent choice.

All metaphors (and it is a story of metaphor) are constrained by the initial division of into conceptual parts, and the limited ways those can be reconnected to form a coherent framework. Unfortunately, conceptual coherence =/= truth. It simply means: self-consistency. Particularly when you are dealing with a description with very few observables, and mostly extrapolation - just as the free-will argument does.  For starters, it would be useful to define ""choice"" and go into detail about the exact mechanism involved in ""choosing"". Without that (unless it can be circumvented by a change of context), there is a limit its usefulness as theory of reality.  It's certainly fun to discuss, but I wouldn't ""believe"" in it or run my life according to it. Which of course, would be slightly paradoxical. :-)"

Parallel Universes and such is an interesting concept certainly but in a conceptual model, there are no certainties. Having said that, what you want is the truth about the nature of reality."

Study the making of the game ""No Man's Sky.""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kifCYToAU  The universe, worlds and animals are all created with math (procedural generation). The World builds itself for you from a seed.  I imagine that if our world is created the same way this is a real possibility. The computer that could allow for alternate potentials running in parallel would be much more powerful than what we have today. It would be exploring infinite varieties in advance of the moment and choose the best version for the desired outcome of the simulation. That's just my guess."

Apparently, there was some person who looked so much like me, strangers kept approaching me calling me by that person's name. One girl even play-punched me in the arm when I responded that I am not that other person, because she just didn't believe me.  Fast forward a few months, I finally met that person, who had been having the same experience in vice versa.  Yes, we had similar features, ethnicities, height, etc. But SO MUCH like me that people completely misidentified us? Come on.  tl;dr - People in general are not that smart/ perceptive.

Whenever I saw Ha's doppelgänger, I would wave my hand and call out Ha's name. I would always know when I said hello to the wrong person because I would receive a puzzled look in reply. This one time, I encountered the doppelgänger in line at the cafeteria, and we shared one of those, ""Oh sorry, you're not my friend"" moments.  I can only imagine what this must have been like from that poor girl's perspective. All around campus, she had this strange guy chasing her around and derisively laughing at her.  I stopped saying hi to Ha after a while, because I could never be sure if it was really her, or if it was her confused doppelgänger."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3b1no1,Linukz,3,Thu Jun 25 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"People look for some easily seen characteristics in strangers. They notice some things, but they are not that smart. If you have tattoos - they mostly just notice them, without actually looking at them. If it's koji/flower/face/tree - as long as it's roughly in the same spot it looks the same.  Think about describing someone. ""You know, the guy with a beard and a tattoo on his right hand"". Then, you see someone who has a beard, a tattoo, and looks kinda like the person, your brain does the connection and, based on your knowledge of his looks, decides that this is the person you ""know"". If you meet someone often, you'll notice more details. Our mind just doesn't store details about the persons we've met once.  Ironically, the more ""different"" things you have, the easier it is to confuse you with someone else, because these details are the things people are looking for. So, for example two girls with blue hair and a tattoo are going to be confused easier than two girls with brown hair without a tattoo, because people automatically assume these are the details that will make them remember this one person, and their mind confuses them. If someone is less ""colorful"", the people will look for something to remember in them, so, coincidentally, will be giving them more attention. Simple psychology.

Actually, the more I think about it, this explains premonitions; we're remembering events that has happened in our alternative timelines but has yet to happen in our own timeline. So basically, premonitions are glimpses of an alternative reality yet to be experienced in our future."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3b46si,luiting57,2,Fri Jun 26 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. I used to meditate a lot and I had odd things occur, I think, from that. One time I was at a coffee shop for open mic. This guy asked if he could sit at the table with me and my girlfriend. I said sure. He started talking to us and I had this intense deja vu feeling. As it happened I sort of went into it and did a mental ""blink"" that hooked and froze what felt like a memory allowing it to be slowed down and unpacked by me. That's the best I can describe it.   What I saw within the deja vu was a future memory. I saw the stranger flirting with my girlfriend, me getting angry and calling him out, he saying lets take this outside, us going outside and he beating the crap out of me. But, I'm at the table and he's doing nothing but watching the stage.  Then he turns and like in my deja vu memory he starts flirting with my girlfriend. When I mean flirting I mean inappropriate, mentally ill, no boundaries type of flirting. It was just like my dream. Because of what I saw I didn't do anything but sit there.  My girlfriend told him to ""F"" off and he said something rude and left the table. Then, we left. She asked me why I didn't stand up to him and protect her. I said I figured she could take care of herself. I mean, if I told her the truth she would have likely broken up with me because I was too weird.   I glimpsed a version of me that had an anger problem that superseded reality (the guy was twice my size). I think I saw a timeline that was slightly ahead of ours. The other me was being beaten and in an intense state of excitement and it bled over as a sense that this had happened before or was familiar.  My best guess anyway."

On one hand I've either lived or worked near BWI in Maryland for my entire life.  I'm very familiar with the way planes look in the sky.  I've seen them at all kinds of different angles, speeds, and distances.  The plane in that video is fairly far away from the camera.  The plane that I saw was very close to me....say 150 yards.  So, no it really didn't look like that.  On the other hand, an optical illusion is the most likely answer.  Occams razor and all that.  It more likely that my eyes were playing tricks on me than unlikelihood that the Air Force was testing out experimental aircraft near one of the busiest roads in the country.  The other thing that has occurred to me is that I thought I was seeing a small to mid sized cargo plane fairly close up.  But perhaps it was actually a much larger plane at a greater distance?  There wasn't anything behind the plane to give it persective.  So, I can't rule this out.  However I don't know what plane is that large."

However it has the proportions of a smaller plane so if you're not too familiar with it's size you could mistake it for being closer and flying slower than it really is.

But I'll do it again, I'm bad at telling stuff (events) in English so I apologise.  I was 18 or 19 I think, and still together with my ex boyfriend. Since he was studying for exams we had this habit that I would use my cell phone to call him once, so he could call back (on the house phone) when he took a break. So I did it, awaitening his call in 5-20 minutes as usual. Only the house phone (not my cell phone, otherwise I would have though it's just a typical phone glitch) rang almost immediately.   I picked up, said ""Hello?"" (*correction: I only just now remembered that I picked up with the usual cheery ""Hello!"" as I was expecting it to be him, not a ""Who is there"" type of ""Hello?"") and there was a short silence, then, my own strange (because your own voice always sounds weird to yourself, I still remember this vividly) voice answered, but a bit shakier, ""Hello?"" then I (the ""me"" I) said something like ""Uhm?"" or ""What?"" and the one on the other side said something to someone in the background, again in my voice. I started to panic and hung up. (The call itself lasted for about 20-30 seconds I think.)  It was quite unspectacular, but it just sounded so exactly like me. I never checked the number (I still lived with my mother and had my own cheap phone with cords, no display) and I regret that, back then I just decided to ignore this incident. But I have read some similar stories on this sub since then and now I wish I had checked. Maybe it was just a very unlikely spooky coincidence. *As in, somebody who sounded like me accidentally calling me at that moment."

Those unlikely odds would still have been way more likely than you calling yourself from another dimension.    Twice in my life I've had people say they saw me somewhere I couldn't have been. Once my cousin at a restaurant I've never been too and once my own mom thought she saw me.  Answer isn't that I have another dimensional me lurking around but that sometimes people look alike and similarly sometimes people can sound alike. Although having a lost twin would also be more likely that another dimensional me.   Still I upvoted in case that .00000000000000...1% chance you did talk to someone from another dimension."

I picked up the phone and I said ""Hello"" and there was this for the long pause and some static -- and then my voice replied back ""Hello"" but it almost sounded like it was just an echo. I was so fucking confused and I just sat there, trying to figure out what the hell I was listening to. And then my voice said it again this time impatiently - ""Helllllo?""  I go ""Hello?!""  My voice says back ""Yeah, what?""  I say ""Who the hell is this?""   My voice says back: ""Whatever man this is dumb.""  And that's it, the static like hiss goes out and the call ended.

Other than that it's a bit of a catch-all ""non-explanation"" for a variety of different effects.   How could we distinguish between actual event clustering and cognitive bias in such cases? I suggest: we probably can't."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aqk6s,TriumphantGeorge,9,Mon Jun 22 19:59:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure confirmation bias quite works as an explanation for things as they unfold - as in, how exactly does it account for it?

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aqk6s,SpaceCadet2000,6,Mon Jun 22 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"If we take the story as described though, then the significance of 222 developed over time, rather than being a retrospective review pattern-match. We're having to hypothesise additional unremembered observations here, in our search for an ""explanation"".  It's surely easier to say there was simply a cluster of observation events with identical content. There's no ""explanation"" for it; it's simply so. If one of the events has personal meaning, then it becomes a story. Otherwise it remains one of those coincidental sequences.  (There might be something to the idea that our apparent personal histories are continually revised in the present moment, but that's pretty much impossible to gather evidence for. The result is the same; it's just another explanatory fiction after the fact.)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aqk6s,TriumphantGeorge,0,Mon Jun 22 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"But he's the one telling the story. If he ""discarded"" something, it's not going to be brought up in his retelling.

We either have to trust OP's reporting, or not I suppose.    We can imagine that maybe he discarded things, but that seems to be inventing something without evidence, just to deny a claim that someone saw ""222"" three times in a row without seeing other numbers between times. In fact, this whole notion of on-the-fly ""discarding"" seems more unlikely and far-fetched than just seeing the numbers three times (in this particular case).  It's a good thing to clarify though, which OP does here:   ""The first time I looked up, I saw the first mile marker. the second time I looked up, I saw the second mile marker. I didn't say it explicitly, but I probably should have. the third 222 was wholly unexpected. it sounds like bologna, but that's how it happened.""   It's more the meaningfulness aspect that made it noteworthy I reckon.   This all probably is coincidence, but saying it's ""literally/definitely"" coincidence is unfounded.   I say ""literally"" coincidence because the word often gets used with an implied ""just"". It definitely is coincidence (several events coinciding within a timeframe) but it's not necessarily ""just"" coincidence. That's why ""synchronicity"" was invented, mind you. EDIT: The observations might not cause each other, but there may be a common cause or larger pattern."

Don't think of the discarding as an actual motion or action. Just something we all do all the time. Subconsciously maybe? We're not mindful of everything we see.  Think about it like this; Sees 222 for the 1st time, thinks woah cool three numbers in a row, it doesnt even have to be that strong of a reaction, just more-so than not noting it all. Sees 2nd 222 mile marker, woah! there it is again. Anything he saw in between might have been discarded. Mile markers like 238, 159... wouldn't have caught his attention while he looked at them, because theres nothing interesting there and he ""discarded"" them  Maybe its better to see it as info he/she is carding or uploading, instead of discarding/removing.  I agree with what you said about coincidence"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aqk6s,suker009,2,Tue Jun 23 17:34:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're gonna see middle ground here, but i also wont bite my tongue.   Well, we might still get something out of it, a new perspective, so it's worth still digging a bit more. We could probably say it a lot simpler, maybe? Let's just call it ""noticing"".    ""Noticing"" is the coinciding of your attention being in one place at the moment an event occurs in that place.   In this case, mile-markers are passing all the time, and your attention is only ""pulled"" towards them at certain times. Those certain times are the times where it was showing ""222"". It's not that you are looking and discarding (which would be an act, as you said) - you genuinely aren't seeing the markers that aren't ""222"". So that isn't confirmation bias, but it is ""something"".   What it might be though, is something that links in with synchronicity. That in some way you are pattern-searching, pre-filtering experience, such that your ""looking"" is timed with the appearance of those patterns. Playing with this idea a bit more...  Noticing: Attention & Events  In the same way as our attention tends to be narrowed down spatially but a movement in the room will ""pull it over"" to that area of space - perhaps our attention is narrowed temporally, but can be ""pulled over"" to areas in time also.  So if I have in mind ""222"" then not only will my attention be drawn to the appearance of ""222"" in static space (noticing ""222""-related imagery in the environment) but it will also end up being drawn to ""222"" in time: I will end up in circumstances where ""222"" is occurring.  In other words, it's not that I am subconsciously aware of ""222"" in the corner of my eye and then my attention snaps to it. It's more general than that. Rather, it's that my mind is selecting ""222-related experiences"" from the soup of all possible events,  one of which is ""looking at a mile-marker with 222"" and another is ""noticing a cool quote on page 222 of my book""."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aqk6s,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:56:13 2015 UTC,"But isn't that confirmation bias, ""my mind is selecting 222 related experiences""  The definition of confirmation bias ""is tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs""  ""Beliefs"" in this case being, woah theres 222 again!   If you could break down youre saying further, thatd be great. Im really trying to understand what youre saying because it sounds fascinating"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aqk6s,suker009,2,Tue Jun 23 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"EDIT: This isn't as precise as I would have liked, but don't have time to revise it, so treat it as hand-waving inspiration at present...     The definition of confirmation bias ""is tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs""   Yes, the problem with this definition is that by itself it doesn't define the phenomenon very well. The ""222"" example of OP isn't so great for exploring this, since they claim to have only looked at ""222"" signs.    But isn't that confirmation bias, ""my mind is selecting 222 related experiences""   Well it can't be that exactly, unless we either limit ourselves to retrospective confirmation or situations where we already know the meaningfulness of the pattern. For the OP story we'd have to be willing to expand a little what is meant by the mind and the information it has access to.   So we'll tweak it a bit for each case. And in each case I'm going to get broader and experimental in an attempt to explain the OP story, just push it and see how far we can go:  Version 1: Retrospective Filtering  If we start with a version that doesn't presume anything about the subconscious and attention and so on, about which we can say nothing (we can't talking about something that isn't observed):   Given a set of observations, there can be a tendency in retrospect to give prominence to those which support a particular theory.   So this is ""confirmation bias"" by review. The implication here is that we see the observations, but the story we later tell about the observations is shaped by our beliefs. We don't really need to propose a mechanism here; it's just good old unwittingly cherry-picking the evidence!   In this example we have been actually seeing lots of mile-marker signs with different numbers. However when we notice the Important Book Page is numbered 222, we selectively recall the signs with 222 as being significant.   Version 2: Corner-Of-Eye Attention Pulling  A second version moves away from what I'd call ""confirmation bias"" and toward ""pattern-finding"" - and involves attention (this is the ""noticing""). But it still fits the general definition provided you already know in advance what pattern you are supposed to be looking for.   Given a spatial environment, our attention will be drawn to areas in space in which our pattern appears. The implication here is that our minds are aware of the whole spatial environment (e.g. the entire room) and it directs our attention to the relevant part of the room.   In this example although our minds are aware of all the mile-marker signs by ""seeing out of the corner of our eye"", our attention only sees those with ""222"" on them.  And then when we read the Important Book Page we also note that it is ""222"" and go wow.   Although this doesn't explain why OP's attention ""knew"" that ""222"" was going to be important before it encountered the book page (remember, they only saw signs with ""222"" from the start).  Version 2b: Corner-Of-Space Attention Pulling  The next version of this broadens things out more and seems to get more esoteric, but really it's just expanding the spatial principle.   Instead of ""seeing out the corner of our eye"" we suggest that our broader minds are actually sensing the larger environment. Given a spatial environment, our attention will be drawn to areas in space at the exact time in which our pattern appears.   This explanation is close to Version 2 except that it explains why we coincidentally look up at the exact moment the mile-marker sign passes by. We are not just filtering what's going in our eye; we are actually filtering the environment and our possible actions such that we experience the pattern.  This explanation works a little better than the previous one (we don't to remotely pretend we are discarding things) but it still doesn't quite account for the ""222"" in the book and the fact that the book page is what makes that number relevant...  Version 3: Global-Landscape Attention Pulling  In this version we go all out on the pattern-matching idea by throwing away the temporal restriction.    Given a spatiotemporal environment, our attention will be drawn to areas in space and time in which our pattern appears. The implication here is that our minds are aware of the whole environment of time and space (e.g. the entire world over all time) and it directs our attention to the relevant parts of the world over all time. Like a landscape with all available observations, filtering it down to ones that match out pattern.   In this explanation, the fact that the Important Book Page is numbered ""222"" is the source of the pattern of experiences relating to ""222"". Although our attention encounters the book page last of all, our minds have seen the whole pattern and have in effect selected the whole sequence via pattern-matching from a timeless perspective.  This explanation needs a lot of back up (e.g. experiential moments co-existing as a configuration space of ""Nows"" like Julian Barbour's The End of Time), but it allows that the two mile-marker signs and the book page number are part of the same selection process. The fact of the Important Book Page being numbered 222 is the filter that is applied across the whole journey. The Important Book Page caused the looking-up-at-the-right-moment to see the mile-markers.  This is a potential framework for understanding synchronicity in general, but it comes with the penalty of having to see ""time"" as the scanning of attention across a static event landscape, rather than something that ""passes"".  And now just for silly fun...  Version 4: Dynamic History; Observation Accumulation  A way to combine the first version with all the others - but retain ""passing time"" - is to say that OP's experience was being dynamically updated as it unfolded. In other words, their ""past"" was being constantly revised as new observations arrived, or their observations were taking as input the previous observations:   OP did not in fact see two mile-markers with ""222"" and then see the Important Book Page with ""222"". They saw the book page and then the mile-markers became the same number in their mind. Their apparent past was adjusted at that moment to correspond to the book page. Or more ambitiously, since OP had never observed the book page before, it was indeterminate until she looked at it (like the John Wheeler ""Delayed Choice Experiment""). Since ""222"" was the current pattern in her mind, that became part of the observation of the book page, essentially ""fixing"" it as ""222"".   I'm not necessarily recommending this one..."

On the other hand, there is something compelling about weird coincidences like yours. If seeing a series of 222 helped bring home a point to you that has since changed your life, does it really matter whether it came from a higher power or not? This event had the same effect on you either way. If it brings you peace to believe that it is a message from a higher power, then believe it! If such a notion troubles your sleep at night, don't believe it! With these kinds of questions, it's hard, if not impossible, to find any real truth. All that we can do is choose to believe the things we find helpful.  As for my opinion on this event in particular, it is extremely odd and extremely unlikely. Impossible? Probably not. But I would also take away profound meaning if it happened to me. There have been a couple things like this that happened to me and I've never been able to explain them satisfactorily. Experiencing things like this make it hard to believe that there isn't anything else out there.  edit:forgot to actually put in the link."

I notice repeating numbers very frequently throughout the day, every single day, when I look up on a whim. They are very often repeating down to the seconds on a digital clock and/or calendar, or on my car clock, radio channel, temperature gauge, or car engine miles/trip function all at once, exactly at the moment I happen to notice. Sometimes they're different single, double, triple, quadruple or more sets of repeating numbers, but very often they are sets of three different numbers repeating. Like say 1, 3 and 7, or 0, 1 and 9, in some random sequence. The most common numbers I get are 1's, 4's, 2's, 5's and 3's in that approximate order. 0's, 7's, 8's and 9's are seen just much less. 6's are seldom seen for me or I do not remember noticing them. Also, sometimes the numbers are not repeating single-digits, but repeating double-digits; 3434.   I notice the repeating way too often during the day, in countless ridiculous manifestations, for them to be coincidence. (Everyone will jump at the chance to refute my previous statement. Yeah, please give me the exact psychological term or cognitive bias for my delusion and define it for me. Please assume I'm a hippie bumpkin who has never taken a psychology course. Humans actually know the truth about everything, so please continue to berate everyone's subjective anomalies because strictly maintaining an encapsulated, rigid, Bill-Nye-dicking-Freudien-sucking society is going to expand our knowledge of the universe.)  Of course, like your experience, the numbers often correlate to moments of intensity which sprinkle my life's path. Sometimes good, sometimes bad, but sometimes even mundane. I laugh, cry, yell obscenities at them or notice and ignore.  I'm sure I'll be downvoted because most feel pestered by spiritual dogma, but I have interpreted that these repeating numbers are a ""cosmic thumbs up"" from what I consider to be the higher power.  These are my personal feelings and if you downvote it, it's because you're cold and heartless and you don't care about feelings. I wish you only the best in your future relationships, you cold-hard science hero, you.  OP, if you are spiritual or if this book is spiritual, seeing the numbers could be a spiritual hint, indicating to you that you are on the correct path, making the correct decision in reading the book. You might see more of the numbers soon!"

The hypothesis is that your scent in the house fades during the day and when it goes completely that's about the time you get home (to simplify things), so when your dog is waiting for you, knowing when you'll come back, that's how they know.  That said, you're right, smell doesn't account for everything. Dogs have been raised with humans for thousands of years and their relationships with us have evolved as well.

I think they are just really, really sensitive animals and they pick up on body language and tone of voice a lot better than we ever could.  The only time she really disobeys my boyfriend is when he calls her to another room and she's sitting with me while I'm feeling down or unwell and I don't want her to leave me.

Might as well explain.  So, a few years ago I lived in a dorm like studio apartment that I shared with my good friend,in a popular national park. (We'll call her Rachel.)  So we each had a key to the apartment, hers was on her keyring in her purse at all times and mine was on a long leather necklace that I always left in the same spot on my dresser.  One day I went to grab my key and it just wasn't there anymore. I remember putting it there when I got home from work. I looked everywhere. Rachel looked everywhere. It was kind of a big deal because if you lost your key it costs 75 bucks to get a new one through housing and, well, I was not trying to give them my money like that.  Weeks go by,  and after cleaning everything and looking everywhere, everywhere- everywhere (it was a small room with a small bathroom) I finally give up. I go admit I lost my key and pay the 75 to get a new one. Got the new one.   Later that day Rachel and I are having another cleaning session because we were both pretty messy. We clean the room while laughing and dancing and listening to music as we always did. I start to vacuum, and vacuum the whole floor. Looked nice and I go to the wall to pull the cord out from the socket, and then I hear Rachel scream. It was more like a shriek really.  I turn my head and she looks like she's seen a ghost.  Her eyes were wide and full of fear and confusion. She was pointing at the floor in the middle of the room. Guess what the fuck was sitting in THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR, where I had just finished vacuuming. My key with the leather necklace. Right there in the middle of the floor.  We both just freaked out a little, then went to the bar and got drunk, cause what the hell else can you do when something like that happens.   We told our story at the bar and in return heard a bunch of stories from our compatriots who lived in the same complex. (Small community, everybody knows everybody.) One girl had a story about her beloved wedding ring and another one simply had one of her work shoes disappear pretty much in front of her face.   But, it seems the common thread was that we all found our missing things after we had finally given up and moved on.  I have heard stories of missing things before and I always assumed it was some sort of mental block and that the objects in question were there, the people just WOULDN'T see them, for whatever reason. But in my case that is impossible because the vacuum would have run over the key and mad an awful racket. But that didn't happen. A very real key was just not there, and then it was."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3ar35l,PremiumCreamie,4,Wed Jun 24 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience with running shoes. I lived in a two bedroom apartment by myself. One room I slept in and the other had a futon couch and a plant in the window only The futon couch was raised off of the floor and so one can easily, even from a distance, see under it. I decided to go running and went to get my running shoes that I kept in the room with the futon. Now remember, the only thing in the room is a futon couch and my running shoes.  Well, they weren't there. So, I looked behind the door, around the futon and found nothing. I thought this was odd but not unusual. I may have left them somewhere else, I decided. I searched the entire apartment and eventually gave up.   About two hours later I walk into the room with the futon to water my plants and there on the floor, in the middle of the room, sat my running shoes. They weren't behind the door or off to the side or tucked weirdly in the futon but right where I would have tripped over them in the center of the room in front of the door.  Because they seemed ""placed"" for me to see them and the room being mostly empty I felt like someone was messing with me. It didn't feel scary like a haunting but like an intelligence was behind this.   Did I go running and get hit by a car and reset back to my apartment by something? It hid my running in order to stop me? Did the shoes fall into a black hole, cease to exist, enter another dimension? Got me. The only thing I know is that it stopped me from running at that time."

The results were awe-inspiring and terrifying.   At first, the fountain itself filled up with about five foot drifts of bubbles, which was cool. Nobody knew what was going on, so they abandoned the area around the fountain. Then the breeze started to pull off chunks of bubbles. Some times it looked like snow, but larger chunks were also flying off.   There was a road about a block from the park, and I was terrified to see the result when the foam went that way. One large sheet of bubbles stayed intact. It was about 2 feet long, a foot wide, and a good six inches tall. A car actually swerved to avoid it. Smaller chunks were landing on people and causing all sorts of mayhem. It was like a weird and highly localized blizzard.   I never did that again."

Detatched is a good term for it.  I have a recurring one about a fascistic US wherein the national symbol is a male figure in a business suit, right arm outstretched, holding an upright globe with eagle talons for fingers. There's a massive statue of him in front of an artificial body of water with a big fuck-off rectilinear, columned building behind the statue.  I could draw the thing, it's so vivid."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3amkbw,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:51:54 2015 UTC,"relaxed and alert at the same time   Yes, that's very well put. There's something to be said for ""attending but not concentrating"". Most of us are under the impression that to attend to something we need to narrow our attention effortfully upon it (hence sore shoulders and jaw muscles after a day in front of the computer screen); this isn't the case.   I have a recurring one about a fascistic US wherein the national symbol is a male figure in a business suit...   Pretty interesting, strong imagery! The places we visit can definitely be persistent (some people spend time deliberately creating persistent realms). In fact I think that all these experiences or ""worlds"" remain, it's a case of whether we can find a ""memory thread"" to get back to them."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3amkbw,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sun Jun 21 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea, I think there might be something to that in terms of quantum observation...  Yeah, very strong imagery! Extremely 20th century and modernist so whatever happened, it happened in the 1960s or 70s I would say. I'm hoping to 'come up' with the name of the place sooner or later.  Another recurring one is a type of building material of all things. White metal. Picture the Golden Gate bridge, but with three supports not two, more serpentine and curving, and all in white steel. I also had a brief glimpse of a habitat for humanity-type organisation erecting a prefab house out of the same white metal. Odd."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3amkbw,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sun Jun 21 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting about the building material.   Robert Monroe wrote up his tales of lucid dream type experiences in a few books (Journeys Out of the Body was the first one I think). There was one he called Locale III which was like an alternate Earth:   Locale III is perhaps the strangest of all, described by Monroe as a kind of pseudo-Earth which 'proved to be a physical-matter world almost identical to our own'. But things were just a bit different: 'There are no electrical devices whatsoever'. The transport there includes a steam-driven locomotive that sounds like a cross between an American motor-home and a High-Speed Train, which hauls wooden cars; and automobiles twice as wide as their Earthly equivalents, which drive along huge roads at a puzzlingly sluggish 15-20 mph.  After several visits to Locale III, Monroe discovers an inhabitant who is his doppelganger. Monroe involuntarily takes over his double's body, and embarrassment and confusion ensue, often involving 'Lea', the Locale III woman with whom the 'other-Monroe' becomes romantically attached.   The main point being, it behaved like a persistent self-consistent place which ""happened"" when he wasn't there."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3amkbw,Plopoholic,3,Sun Jun 21 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"The interesting things to wonder are:    Did that place exist prior to his having the experience of being there? Or did starting a dream (as you have done) via hypnogogia basically create that place and then it persisted? Does the place continue to ""happen"" when nobody is looking, or is it like other dreams where things are seen ""as if"" they have happened? Like when you open a door, there's always a scene beyond (""creation by implication"" or by expectation-logic). How does the world experience we are having right now differ from these worlds? Isn't ""being born"" and then gradually being able to see, hear and feel a bit like the creation of a world via hypnogogia....?"

Though, you've definitely made me think about another of my places, which is a Coney Island type park with a large train station beneath it. I've been there about 6 or 7 times, to the point where I could give directions from one part of the park to another. It feels like I go to a place which objectively exists, in that the weather varies and the light changes slightly depending on time of day, but the structures remain in the same places.

That is maybe the reason why there is a Youtube video for it, to know if people will like it. Then, maybe the person who composed it has a connection from someone on that radio station and he/she asked them for the song to be played there for more exposure. Unfortunately, it didn't gain popularity and thus, pulled out from the radio.   Four years later, the composer heard about this band and thought that maybe THEY can help this song to be famous. Or maybe the composer is friends with the band and sold/give them the song.   And to avoid copyright and all that, composer deleted the Youtube video. Or maybe their account was deactivated by Youtube because of being inactive. And two years after that, the band finally released the song. But that's just my theory."

If the difference is small enough or not related to you it goes un-noticed. If the difference is just that a tree the is 100 miles away is in one dimension but does not existent in another and you jump from one to the other you would never know. I feel that jumps and slips happen all the time to everyone. People only realize something is not right when a difference is noticed by them. For most people the difference is so small or so unrelated to them it goes unseen. And most of the people that do seen it are too easy to dismiss it for one reason or another. The few times that it is too in your face and too big to dismiss is the only time it gets noticed. This same question and topic has been talked about server times on here.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aipnq,David2026,5,Sat Jun 20 16:32:55 2015 UTC,A dimension isn't a place you go. It's a mathematical index used to parameterize a particle.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aipnq,Shaman_Bond,7,Sat Jun 20 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I think that in this case ""dimension"" is meant in the sense of a location in a configuration space, where each position would correspond to a particular ""world-state"" - or a variation on the more colloquial use of ""dimension"", meaning a ""realm"" which is in such a state."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aipnq,TriumphantGeorge,7,Sat Jun 20 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"In an infinite universe, a particular, finite world state will occur an infinite number of times. Let's imagine a universe composed purely of numbers in a string (with enough effort we could represent our own universe this way, but let's not go there right now.) For the sake of my thumbs,  let's assume that the observation horizon (the distance light, or its equivalent,  has traveled since the beginning of the universe) is only four numbers wide. Here's a portion of a random number universe:  ... 72253900003745001051798300002649...  In this universe, the first occurrence of 0000 will be our observable universe. If you look a few characters to the right, beyond where light has had time to travel, you will find 0010, which is different from our universe by only on number. This is a parallel universe. If you keep going, you will find 0000 again; this universe is, at the present moment, identical to our universe. There is an identical copy of you there, reading and identical copy of this comment. As time passes, these two universes will diverge due to interactions with dissimilar adjacent regions, and become parallel realities.   Obviously in any realistic simulation, the number strings would be much wider, but you get the point.   Now, if you really want to hurt your brain, consider that you could encode the positions, velocities and any other fundamental properties of matter and energy in a string of numbers such as the one above. Even if it takes a billion numbers to describe a single hydrogen atom, that sequence of numbers can be found in pi - in fact, every atom in Earth can be found in pi, every atom and particle in the universe can be found in pi; every possible universe is described somewhere within the decimal representation of pi, or e, or any other irrational number.

Like ""theory"", it has a specific use in certain subject areas, which is narrower than its general use.  This ill-informed pedantry causes lots of problems besides simply annoying people. For instance, it leads to the mistaken idea that the ""time and space"" of physical theories are directly equivalent to the  ""time and space"" of subjective experience.  It's usually folks who have smug ""science enthusiasm"" but have never read any of the corresponding philosophy or metaphysics who make these errors, though."

If you're going to abscond with terminology and ideas from quantum mechanics and relativity, then you had damn well better use the proper wording and definition for it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aipnq,Shaman_Bond,3,Sat Jun 20 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"I see the utility in philosophy, unlike many of my fellow physics people.   Glad to hear it! :-)   I really think that without being conscious of the  philosophy implicit in our theories (and there always is one), we are doomed to be in effect ignorant philosophers. (I'm with the other George on this.) In particular, it can lead us to confuse ""conceptual coherence"" - the self-consistency of a framework - with the ""truth"" of a situation.   There is no difference between the subjective time and space and the time and space manifolds.   I heartily disagree. I've never experienced a spatial dimension, although I have inferred one from a measurement. And I have definitely never experienced a temporal dimension. I have however experienced thinking-about those things during an experience.   A dimension in physics is a well established thing.   For sure - well, actually it has many different context-dependent meanings - but it's pretty obvious that here it is meant more in the sense of ""realm"" or ""world"" rather than geometric dimensionality, right?  Although I'd certainly agree that if terminology is used to imply a connection to physics incorrectly, it should be pointed out (e.g. everything being a ""quantum"" this or that), the reverse - the restriction of certain words simply because they are also used, more narrowly, in the sciences - is just as dubious a trend."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aipnq,TriumphantGeorge,4,Sun Jun 21 18:13:05 2015 UTC,"""World-line"", okay similar.  Elsewhere, I've been using ""world-pattern"". This consists of the now pattern which includes the bright unfolding shapes of present sensory experience, plus the dimmed shapes that we call ""the past"" and ""the future"", and the shapes we call ""thought"" and so on. All as part of one single interconnected pattern. (There is nothing outside of this pattern; the formattings we call ""time"" and ""space"" are patterns within this.)  The only rule of the world-pattern is:   The world-pattern is always self-consistent, since it is a single coherent pattern. The world always ""makes sense"" overall.   If a change is made to the world-pattern, this rule means that:   All subsequent observations will be consistent with the new state of the world-pattern. Changing one part of the world-pattern may ""tug"" upon other parts. If one fact is changed, other apparently unrelated facts may change. This includes the apparent past (which is just a present part of the world-pattern). The only evidence of a state change may be the personal memory of the observer.   What we call ""changing dimensions"" is really changing this ""world-pattern"" such that knock-on effects are observed. This results in an experience that feels like we have shifted to another world with different facts and a different history.  EDIT: Made some changes to finish up and make this more coherent."

This entire thread is precipitated upon the (false) idea that you can travel between dimensions. Why is that not a cause to use terminology correctly?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aipnq,TriumphantGeorge,3,Sun Jun 21 04:42:31 2015 UTC,"The fact that you move in 3-space and have a temporal displacement in time and can observe increasing entropy in various systems means you're moving forward in time.   That's rather begging the question, isn't it? Those concepts are certainly useful for creating a description of particular measurements within experience, but they are not the experience themselves, or ""the nature of things"". In particular, it's not at all clear in what sense I am located in time or how I can move forward in it.  Note, I'm not saying there's no value in self-consistent descriptive frameworks (they're incredibly useful), however you can't claim truth by promoting one part of the framework by referring to another.  In other words, no description is fundamental; the world is not ""made from"" spatial dimension and time. (I'm getting Kantian here.) So to restrict our descriptions and language to a certain set of concepts, albeit useful in certain contexts, is an error.   This entire thread is precipitated upon the (false) idea that you can travel between dimensions.   In what way is it false?   Only if you restrict the word ""dimension"" to its narrow use of (x,y,z,t,etc) rather than its other meanings. Which is akin to dismissing all uses of the word ""colour"" unless they refer to the (R,G,B) gamut.   Why is that not a cause to use terminology correctly?   Because it's wouldn't be correct use of the terminology; we're not talking physics or mathematics here. I think I said this elsewhere, but it's not using ""dimension"" in the sense of length, breadth, height, time. It's using it in the accepted sense of ""world"" or ""realm"" or ""reality"" or ""another dimension"" (literature sense), although it could be formulated metaphorically as a configuration space in another descriptive scheme.  I mean: you understand what is meant, right?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3aipnq,TriumphantGeorge,13,Sun Jun 21 07:42:52 2015 UTC,"Well,  surely ""Jumping Dimensions"" is just a metaphor for describing discontinuous change in one part of  your experience relative to another part? Basically, that your personal-sensory-experience doesn't match your personal-memory-experience.  You can theorise about whether the world changed, you jumped worlds, or your memory changed - but all of those are basically fictional concepts in any case.   There is no ""world"" other than your experiencing of it. There is no ""memory"" other than your experiencing of it.   Both are experiences that you have now. When they stop matching up, you could call it ""switching dimensions"", but really that's just an explanatory fiction. Nobody has ever seen a ""dimension""."

That would mean we are ""jumping"" from a reality to a parallel reality, to a parallel reality, that are very very similar to each other; at the rate of, I don't know, let's say thousand times a second.  If what I stated previously was fact, would it be possible to ""skip"" through some of the possible realities?"

We were walking to our car after leaving a friends house and he was getting creeped out by some guy.  I thought it was the guy on the sidewalk walking towards us, but a minute after he commented about how the guy was giving him the creeps he started getting wicked freaked out because the man wasn't there anymore.  Apparently there was an older gentleman just standing at the end of a driveway smoking a cigarette staring at us.  I never saw him, but it didn't smell like cigarette smoke, so I don't know if my SO got confused or what.  I believe he honestly saw it, though, he doesn't make stuff like that up.  The other thing that happened was this.  Our cats get fed wet food at night, so we were in the middle of feeding them and we put the food cans on the counter after using them.  We went to put the food back in the fridge but couldn't find the cover to one of the cans ANYWHERE, figured it must have fallen off the counter and our cats are screaming at us so we put the one can with a cover in the fridge, feed them first, and look for it later.  We go upstairs to put the food down and then go back downstairs to search for the missing cover.  Now the can of food is no longer on the counter and nowhere to be found as is the cover.  After unsuccessful searching, on a whim I look in the fridge.  Well somehow the can and the cover were reunited and put in the fridge while we were upstairs.  Both of us know we didn't put it there, and we were both together the whole time so we would have noticed if the other put it away."

Just recently this last year I moved and attended a school for my senior year. Around 4 years earlier I had a dream of me and a bunch of friends that I've never met or seen were on a road trip going to who knows where. This ended up happening about a month ago. How did I have a dream of people I've never met, and then meet them years later? Maybe about 5-6 years ago I dreamed about leaving practice and getting a ride home from one of my close friends in his car, in a different school, and a different town. About two years ago I ended up going to a new high school as well since I moved into the town about 4 years ago. Never realizing this was the friend I dreamt about even though we were close most of my time living in this town. It hit me when I got in his car and as we were leaving the school parking lot. It blows my mind how I can create these scenes and situations with people and places I've never been."

It's all very clear, and the Nick I was introduced to is not the same person as I met the second time. It's been years, and I have been over it it my mind many times. Seeing others' similar stories has been quite validating.  I don't know if I did an adequate enough job in explaining that the first and second Nicks were two completely different people. Imagine an actor being replaced in his role on a show or in a play by someone else. That's the closest analogy I can come up with.

They write the script for a new scene (INT. PARTY ROOM - NIGHT) and everything's all set up - but when it gets to the day of shooting it turns out that Nick #1 lied on his CV! He can't actually sing or play a musical instrument at all!

To our bodies, now, it would be feel like gliding, but back then we were just tiny kids that weighed nothing. Basically you're remembering a memory and using your current fully grown body to act out that memory, which would feel like gliding."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3abw2a,hairierdog,9,Thu Jun 18 21:49:43 2015 UTC,"YES!!! I've always thought it was something I was 'remembering wrong' until just this moment! I even remember telling my grandmother about it... saying I jumped down the stairs, and she said ""one at a time? that's dangerous"" and I replied ""no, all of them!"" and she just kind of put me off like when kids are exaggerating or something...   I remember being at the top and jumping, but not leaping forwards like you would normally do if you were trying to get to the bottom of a flight of stairs quickly. More like a 'hop', more vertical at the beginning, and while I was in the air I would point my feet down the stairs... the same way that when jumping into water intending to drop down to the bottom fast, you point your feet down... only I'd kind of make my legs parallel to the stairs, and 'whoosh' to the bottom.    Once I failed to jump, and just stepped out off the top step and lost my balance. I fell down the whole flight of (carpeted) stairs, getting a nasty rug burn on the side of my face. I was quite young at the time, and I'm sure that I ""jumped"" down the stairs after that... I suspect I'd 'jumped' down the stairs before that too, but I can't be sure.   As I got older, I'd jump like that less and less... I do remember a time when the staircase would take two jumps, necessitating landing on a step in the middle somewhere... and eventually I stopped jumping altogether. I eventually came to assume it was a false memory... but you so accurately describe exactly the feeling in those memories... maybe it's not a false memory after all, but something others have experienced too."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3abw2a,timawesomeness,4,Fri Jun 19 04:13:52 2015 UTC,"Not jumping but sliding. I remembered my sister and I playing a game where we would sit on a towel or in a laundry basket and one of us would push the other down the steps and we would slide down like we were on a sled.  When we got a little older,  like 12, I asked her if she wanted to play that game and she didn't remember it but would play as long as I went first to show her how.  I got in the laundry basket at the top of the stairs and told her to give me a push.  She pushed me and it was exactly as I remembered it,  sliding like a sled on freshly fallen snow...for about three steps.  Then the basket caught the lip of the fourth step and launched me into the air like a mini plastic catapult.  I tumbled down the steps and landed at the bottom bruised and sore and shocked that it didn't work.   This was a game that I had remembered playing hundreds of times and I never got hurt.  My mother heard me falling, followed by the empty laundry basket which made a sound like a bass drum with every step it hit, then me lying at the bottom of the steps whimpering, confused and injured,  looking back up the steps at my terrified sister with tears in my eyes.  My mother took in the whole scene, immediately assumed that my sister had pushed me down the steps with the intention of hurting me.  Being  more concerned with justice than well-being she immediately started berating  us both,  trying to ascertain what our non-existent argument had been about, and of course,  who was at fault for me being at the bottom of the steps.   I tried to convince her that we were playing a game and it was an accident but the look of dread on my sisters face made it hard to believe.  She thought she had just killed her little brother.   20 years later my sister and I laugh about it.  My mother doesn't believe we were playing a game,  but she is convinced that whatever I did to compel my sister to push me down the steps,  I deserved what I got."

I've never been able to quite dismiss it as a dream, because the memory has always possessed such an intense feeling of reality for me--the tension in my body as I jumped, the feeling of my T-shirt brushing over the tops of the steps as I glided over them, the burn of the carpet against my legs as I skid to a stop. I also clearly remembering thinking that I could only do this because I had 'slipped' beneath the attention of some sort of authority, and that I needed to enjoy it before I was noticed and forced to conform to the ordinary rules of reality again."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3abw2a,Brandwein,2,Fri Jun 19 11:42:59 2015 UTC,"I use to that a lot as a kid. My landings were always quite graceful, considering I was (still am) clumsy. I don't know what caused it, but I would regularly jump from the top step of a flight of about 16 steps all the way to ground. I wouldn't call it gliding, but it always seemed different to jumping down to a lower level (I.e. When you jump off a wall to the ground etc).  Maybe the gliding effect comes from your brain not registering that you're actually jumping from quite a height because you've got the steps staying roughly the same distance from your feet the entire way down.  I tried doing this the other year when on my lunch break at work and I popped 3 toes out of their sockets. So I wouldn't advise testing it out now that you're older. Stings."

I used to sled down hills in winter and intentionally crash into trees so I could get launched in the air and then crash onto the ground. Never hurt, it was fun, just would pop right back up and do it all over again. Nowadays all I gotta do is trip from a standing position and it hurts for an hour."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3abw2a,hardboiledtoast,2,Fri Jun 19 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"I've know that I've done this, but it wasn't something ""supernatural"". My brother and I invented this game where we would stand on higher and higher steps in our two story house's main staircase and see who could jump down and make it all the way to the bottom landing.  Reaching the top steps, we started padding the landing area and abutting walls with cushions from the living room's sofa set. Eventually we were able to leap from the very top step, ""gliding"" over the entire staircase before crashing into the cushions at the bottom. I guess it was sort of like those wingsuit videos we see on the internet these days.  This probably isn't the experience OP's talking about since the landing would have been hard had it not been for the padding at the bottom of the stairs."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3abw2a,TriumphantGeorge,2,Fri Jun 19 19:09:34 2015 UTC,"Every time you look back on a memory, even only moments after the event, you brain has skewed some information. Over enough years, some memories will be just a lie your brain has made up to fill in a gap where a particular event was stored, these are called 'false memories'. Everyone has them. False memories are commonly about childhood and infancy. Over the years you hear stories of things you did as a child and you unconsciously begin making up a memory of it, thus feeling as though you remember it happening to you. This is the same reason pathological liars actually begin to believe what they say - they're unconsciously creating false memories of their lies.  I can see this being an instance of false memory, as perhaps you've incidentally lied to yourself enough times about how many steps you were up, or you've exaggerated the event to people enough times.  Also, small things seem much grander to little eyes.  On that note, I too have memories of leaping impossible distances, but I have always rationalized it as poor memory of the events."

In these dreams this action was achieved by performing a whole-body motion like one would perform say they were swimming, but instead, upwards and through the air. In these dreams this action always feels very physically taxing and is hard to do for long durations, especially for that the longer I do it the harder it is to breath.

It just got the nervous energy out of me some days and kept me from going crazy most days. i would jump down and keep my feet close to the steps to feel like I was hovering or just slide down while stepping on each step and would occassionally use the handrail for jumping more steps or support. Anyways. Have also had those dreams tho btw."

I remember staring at the carpet, the pattern was light blue with small dark blue polkadots. As i was looking at the floor the dots got bigger and bigger then i cant remember anything after that.  its so vivid i always feel its a memory as the details never change, i can even remember how my hair was, my nightdress and that i was barefoot.  so weird and im glad im not the only one."

I wonder whether it's the technique that matters, or the taking of a moment and deliberate intention to reach the numbers that exist.  Just ""having a guess"" isn't really an intention at all, for instance; it's blind hope.

Simple staying open to the possibility allows the possibility to happen.  You may have misread the clock, or the clock actually glitched, but either way it's possible that your mind or the world was trying to key you into the number you were seeking.

Watching television is a very passive activity. Television is overly commercial. Programs that might be of value have that value masked with storytelling devices and esoterica. Symbols can be very powerful tools, but symbols can hide the truth.  I haven't watched television for over three years.  I'm not familiar with Powerpuff Girls.  This current storm of synchronicity seems to have started with my reading a lot of /r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix and about synchronicity and other related material. Reading so much about it has undoubtedly opened me up to it and made me more aware of it. The many personal anecdotes combine to build a model of reality that is very different from what we've been conditioned to accept. This contribution of many minds might magnify this model for the reader in ways that  books or video programs that are crafted by fewer people can't approach.  Environment is a big factor, too. My environment is very open, and it provides a lot of space to explore. This space allows clarity and focus that might not be easy to achieve in a more densely populated environment with so much artificial stimuli."

I wish I could do it consciously. Around that time I was having a lot of odd dreams though. I remember in one I was this over weight black pastor of a church and had like five kids. I drove a white van and had a wife that was only married to me because she wasn't brave enough to be a pastor herself.  She resented me and made my life miserable. In the dream I had the guys entire back story. That was ten years ago though and that's all I remember. Was the guy a real person? I don't know but his life totally sucked because he had no courage to end things.  When I woke up  I was relieved beyond words.  In the real world I'm a white guy and never had any kids and certainly wasn't married at the time. It seemed real in every way.

Some say we are a reflection of the universe, which tells me we are merely projections. Others think that the universe is simply (in a complex way) a simulation of some sort. Least that is what I have read in the media.  I sometimes think that our reality is like a stack of papers that all fit in the same space. If you look at it, the paper is blank. If you look closely, you will see that every possible outcome in someone's life is depicted on that paper, not in any order or construct, just is there somewhere. SO I feel when someone says you start off with a clean slate, what they are reminding me is that any possibility is probable in my life, simply because I can think of it. Finding it on the piece of paper, that's the pain in the ass and represents why all the good things are hard to gain because our paper is all jumbled up with possibility.

I played with this a little before - see the little experiment here.  We tend to assume that the world is an ""extended place"" just as we perceive it, but as in a video game it is closer to being a collection of ""dimensionless facts"" in the background, which we unfold aspects of into sensory experience."

Every realm of possibility at an infinite scale confined upon itself in layers and condensed to the most singular point. Now I am no physicist, but think about how much energy that one life would take to exist and realize that the fabric of reality is actually you. You are a thread within the weave that defines your purpose and existence.  Would that describe a possible reason for black holes?  They start out as a gaseous concept that ignites with possibilities and during that time, perhaps some rocks and materials are floating around nearby and that blazing idea starts to affect the area around it. Creating, moving, destroying, and then to create again. Over and over until the most focused and refined concept flares into existence, hotter and brighter than all the other tiny flare that flashed out by comparison.  A supernova of an idea that supersedes all others as the raw materials are now needed to create this concept and idea. As good ideas go, they collapse down to a single ultimate question. The question that now has no other answer because the best, most possible concept failed to answer. All that energy condensed down to a point and the celestial consciousness, in its most stubborn curiosity asks the second question of: ""Why?"" and the the final of the three questions: ""What if?""   Which cause the large explosion of energy and matter in all directions and starts to experiment with all the new possibilities that the new question allows to ask.

For multiple apparent levels, you don't need multiple pieces of cloth.  There are no such things as ""hierarchies"" and ""levels"" and ""nesting"" in reality. They are an artefact of conceptualising, where we divide our experience and position the resulting fragments relative to one another in mental space.

The simulation scenario is firstmotivated by extrapolating current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCDinto the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory technology as a guide,we assume that our universe is an early numerical simulation with unimproved Wilson fermiondiscretization and investigate potentially-observable consequences. Among the observables that areconsidered are the muong2and the current differences between determinations of, but themost stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing of the universe,b1>1011GeV, is derivedfrom the high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3a38zp,kat5dotpostfix,2,Wed Jun 17 05:13:50 2015 UTC,Excuse me for being a little confused.   The hololense isn't a reality its a projection of a reality. The reality being the 1's and 0's in the computer doing the calculations. If you turned the hololense off that simulated reality would still be functioning we just wouldn't be able to see it.   So in the end it will always be nested realities when talking about this theory.  The calculations would come from inside the larger computational device which is inside an even larger computational device. The source would always be some computational device.   Unless I'm missing something?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3a38zp,dingo_bat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:11:25 2015 UTC,"I hope I can explain this better.  Let's say you're on the Starship Enterprise (Next Generation), and you create an IBM computer on the holodeck. Traditionally, the way of thinking about that simulated IBM is that inside of it are simulated transistors and circuits ""clicking and clacking"", producing calculations and output for the simulated screen. (Also, think about how people make those simple computers in Minecraft out of virtual blocks, and the virtual blocks do the calculations.)  What I'm saying is that simulated transistors aren't necessary on the holodeck. All that needs to simulated are the IBM's beige plastic case and monochrome screen. When a user types in a calculation request, it's shunted directly to the Enterprise's central computer. The result is then shunted back to the holodeck and displayed on the monochrome display.  This method cuts down the cumbersome requirement of having to simulate millions of transistors just to make a trivial (to the starship) calculation.  I supposed this idea could be considered obvious, but I haven't seen it stated explicitly."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3a38zp,spreggo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:17:05 2015 UTC,"Ok I think I'm getting a better picture of what your saying.  Your saying that we don't need to simulate the ""Hardware"" such as transistors because the calculations will be done in the reality above?   When you says users you mean simulated user right?  Well if that is what you mean then it would point to the existence of a higher reality. Because the simulated user could observe that the calculation happens by miracle with no physical explanation as to how it happen in his simulated world and no means ever of figuring out how things ultimately work.   It all depends on what kind of reality you are trying to simulate. You can simulate one where you, the ""God"", clearly make it known you are a ""God"" or you can simulate one that is completely self sufficient, dependent with no obvious creator known to the simulation.   No matter what the processing is going to be done by the larger computational device. What you are suggesting is just a reduction in the amount of processing needed by the larger computer but not an elimination of it.   So instead of needing 4 bits for each part of a transistor you skip simulating that and instead save the memory.   When we assume a simulation of our reality we assume it's being done by a computational device that can handle our entire universe and every single thing we can observe , including transistors, atoms, electrons you name it.   Interestingly enough even our observably reality gets hard to measure the deeper we look. For example Quantum physics has the uncertainty principle, where it difficult to measure a particles  trajectory, momentum or position, because looking at one changes the other.   Perhaps this is a limitation of our simulated reality? Where by the larger computational device simply stops trying to convince us of our reality? Or maybe we just haven't figured it out yet?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3a38zp,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"When we assume a simulation of our reality we assume it's being done by a computational device that can handle our entire universe and every single thing we can observe , including transistors, atoms, electrons you name it.   So in practice, the base reality computer would only have to simulate things that are being directly observed. For example, are you aware of every atom in your desk? Nope. But if you turn an electron microscope onto your desk, will you see atoms? Yes - however, only the atoms you observe need to be simulated. In this way, the base computer doesn't need to be able to calculate everything in the universe simultaneously.  Some people might say that particle and wave duality could be an indication that these observation dependent calculations are taking place. When not observed, matter and energy is calculated as a wave - thus saving an infinitude of particle calculations. However, if some cheeky scientist sets up a detector, then particles must be simulated as particles, and the wave ""behavior"" disappears.  I personally feel that there is also something funny going on with the uncertainty principle. Perhaps this saves a ton of calculation power by having momentum and velocity occupy the same data space. It may also allow a certain amount of ""free will"" to take place since the absolute state of matter is never specifically determined."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3a15lp,TriumphantGeorge,2,Tue Jun 16 12:49:52 2015 UTC,I think the longing drew this to you. I think that the first person was not human and simply looked like the guy you eventually saw. This reminds me of a Men in Black type of thing. The longing is an attracting type of energy for the paranormal and UFOs too. At least it seems to work that way from my experience.

One example: A tight group of friends (11 including me) did not recognize or remember me after being away for a few months. These were not casual friends or aquaintances; these were more like ""getting invited to eachothers family-events""-friends.  It is possible that i imagined 4 years of interaction, friendship and experiences together....but it is highly unlikely."

(And the people on here who think every experience is a seizure just have not had those types of things happen yet. You kind of have to experience it to believe it I guess.)
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39zqdm,PremiumCreamie,4,Tue Jun 16 03:54:42 2015 UTC,"Plato's Cave. Seriously. I think about that concept all the time. Almost like this Earth and all the drama that goes along with having the human experience is enough to keep us occupied that we rarely think outside our own perception of reality.   People here really think these experiences are caused by seizures? I mean, I guess there's no way of knowing for sure, being that these are just subjective anecdotes shared on the internet, but damn if I'd be hard pressed to agree that every single experience written here was caused by some brain malfunction. That just seems very unlikely."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,luiting57,6,Mon Jun 15 20:48:17 2015 UTC,Amazing story. Weren't you scared after you came back into your body again and was 'rewinded' to the moment your were waiting at the red light at the bottom of the hill? I would probably be too scared and shaken up to even drive any further. I once experienced a loss of control of my own body and it was as if another entity took over while I was observing myself and freaking out over it. It shook me up very badly.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,Miz4r_,12,Mon Jun 15 21:30:20 2015 UTC,"I wasn't driving the car. We would flag friends down and hop into cars. I realized later that the entity was me, another me, or the future me.. confusing. But, I have never really ever gotten over that. It is unlike anything you could imagine. I still get chills and I get angry over what or who did that to me. I assume it was the being that made me guess which point of light I came from.  It didn't feel evil or dark but more like being tested for some unknown reason. I resent that."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,beckster,5,Mon Jun 15 22:59:32 2015 UTC,Maybe the event happened to give you exactly the perspective you now have.  Are we creating something here or going along for the ride?  You tell me.

Not made up in your mind but you actually experienced the real you controlling your avatar human body from the location you really are in.  Its a bit differcult to explain or I should say it requires a greater explanation than any one wants to read here.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,lisabauer58,4,Tue Jun 16 16:39:43 2015 UTC,You mean like the Oversoul (think that's what Jane Robert's Seth called it)?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,lisabauer58,2,Tue Jun 16 23:02:06 2015 UTC,I don't know what an Oversoul is.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,beckster,6,Wed Jun 17 00:59:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's like the Huna belief, right? Humans have three souls. One is a beginner souls and the middle one is who we identify with and the higher soul is like an angel. We tell the basic soul what we need and that soul can speak directly to the angel like soul. I always thought that was interesting. I think I understand that concept correctly.  But, maybe we stuff a simple copy of ourselves into the physical And expand once we are done here."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,lisabauer58,7,Wed Jun 17 03:16:41 2015 UTC,"I often think about our connection to our soul and, likely, it is a very complexed process we may not understand.  Many people say in an out of body experience, they see a silver cord attached to themselves.  This silver cord stretches.   When I had my first NDE. I went to the void, a dark peaceful place that I even though was better than our existance here.  Imagine that. (If the void in darkness was that nice,  imagine what going to Paradise is like?). But one thing I felt very strongly about is that the void had millions, if not billions, of people there although you could not see them.  I could sense their presence.  Combining the two ideas of the silver cord and the void, I have an idea that the cord connects us to ourselves which is outside of us and we are all located in the void.  I believe its possible that as a soul we are concentrating so deeply that we do not talk to each other that much in the void unkess someone requires help or assistance.  I then wonder if the solutions are disscused and other souls help to put the required change into action.  Its like this body is an avatar and really connected to the soul to experience life.  Perhaps when we die this silver cord breaks?  When we have extream differculties in life here, sometimes we are forced out of the body (without severing the cord) to protect the soul from damage that it cant recover very well from.  At this time that person is forced back into its orginal location which is the void?  Once the damage to the body is repaired to a degree were the soul can tolerate the pain, the souls awareness goes back into the body again.  The void is black because there can be no distractions to the mental process of the souls purpose.  It is extreamly calm and peaceful.  The void is very close to the earth plane.   We have one soul.  This soul is connected to all other souls.  What we feel are guardians are the souls that choose to be close to each of us.  These souls can be on the other side as well as on this side.  Our storys are written and rewritten within the void as all souls have this ability and must match their storys to the changed one for the changes to be smooth.  Many small events must alter to giving another soul a helping hand and the other souls weighs out its need.  If the need is strong enough, a change is made.  While I as in the void my thoughts were directed to all the knowledge of the universe and I understood everything.  When I was told to go back to my body, I had to focus on my bodys thoughts to achieve this.  I had to pull out of the void by thinking about my earthly plane so I could re-enter our physical plane.  And when it happened, gravety, breathing, flexing muscels, organs working (every thing involved with living). hurt like hell!  :)  BTW I was not allowed to keep the knowledge of everything.  I do remember thinking how simple it all was.  I was allowed to remember the part in the void that was the experience of going back.  That place feels timeless so I do not know how much time passed while I was there.  The part of knowing everything felt like a second.  The part of returning felt much longer as I began to feel our physical world again.  The clearer the image of this world got as I was returning the more I began to experience a time flow.  So the Void is forever as well as a second long.  Strange isn't it to be so contradicting."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,lisabauer58,2,Wed Jun 17 13:14:09 2015 UTC,"Nor do I, really, but my impression is that it's the Higher Self who manages all of our lifetimes and karmic responsibilities.  But that's just my thinking."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,lisabauer58,7,Wed Jun 17 21:38:00 2015 UTC,"I was told that the way home was wanting to be there.  Like you said it comes from the heart, a feeling of longing that takes you home.  I always thought the wizard of oz was inspired by the auther after an NDE experience.   Its only a guess.  For instance there is the tornado (the tunnel?).  There is a very vivid, colorful world much brighter than ours and different areas of communities of like minded people.  Also to return home one only has to want to go home and think on it.  There are many books that mirror NDEs (near death experiences)  You have an interesting story.  I wonder if you enter the void and experienced your storyline before it happened?  Again, simply a guess on my part."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,lisabauer58,3,Tue Jun 16 16:34:14 2015 UTC,What did you mean in your last paragraph. I'm not sure I follow you. Thanks in advance.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,subreddit333,2,Wed Jun 17 03:20:37 2015 UTC,"I believe we are the painters to our storys canvas.   In other words our stories are already written and we choose this life to experience certain things so that we had the opportunity to grow in our spiritual life.  Our stories can be changed in small degrees should our community of souls decide it would not distract from our bigger purpose or cause to big a ripple in the others storyline.  What I wondered was if your thoughts were transfered into the void (the plane that is dark and very calm) and you picked up your story line of whats to come. By doing so you created a problem with the painting of reality were other souls close to you was needed to return you to the past to live in the corrections they needed to make.  Even if it is a very small awareness of something or a physical change in our envirnoment that you may have altered, this change could have long term affects that may interfer with other stories. You could have even changed your story by your awareness of wittnessing something else in the future.  The voices saying you should be put back you were not suppose to hear. I also heard two voices disscussing me that I wasn't suppose to hear as well.  When you knew what was going to happen was because you knew your story in advance for a very short time and then went back to your physical reality and lived it.  You are shifting back and forth within our souls world and your physical one.  At least that's my idea on it based on my experiences."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,rubynorails,4,Wed Jun 17 13:31:37 2015 UTC,I think you're right about the voices and how I wasn't supposed to hear them. This is why I love Phillip K. Dick stories. I think he had similar experience to you and I and since he was a writer he fit them into his science fiction stories. Maybe when this stuff happens the actual memories are flattened and made one dimensional in order to be understood by our physical minds. That's why I can't remember what you're proposing. You have an interesting and insightful mind.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,theendishigh,2,Wed Jun 17 14:35:35 2015 UTC,"I too like Phillip Dick  as well.  I pick up his train of thought easily and I too believe his voices are with him as he moves back and forth in different planes.

This may be why I seem to be fluid like this or have these experiences. I was asked to come back because my mother didn't handle my death well. I saw the funeral.  When I came back I remembered everything about my birth to my death. It was all planned out. I made myself forget certain things because it would have kept me from growing and I would have caused serious problems since I wouldn't have acted correctly. But, as I came out of the water I was considering hanging onto everything.  The memories did flatten and become almost cartoon like compared to the reality of what happened.  In order to test the memories a few years later I asked my mother why I was carried out of the hospital in a pink blanket. I did say how I knew. She was angry and declared that my Grandmother had told me. I just let her think that. She had expected me to be a girl hence the pink blanket. Not sure I should have mentioned this though in this area."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,KikeSmasher1488,13,Tue Jun 16 05:36:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks. It's true. The woman in the story would probably remember me knowing word for word what she said. I assume this since she avoided me after that she was pretty freaked. She asked me how I could have possibly known what she was going to say because it wasn't something you could guess. I didn't know her family outside of her brothers.   At any rate, I had a similar thing happen a year later. This type of event never happened again after. Both events involved a time skip back and forth.   In the second one I was walking with someone, then they weren't there and then they were again. The other person, as far as I know, never noticed anything. I blacked out between each shift. In the second I was at the end of the block, alone. I turned around looking for my friend and she was no where to be seen. I watched a man start to water his lawn and a car with a bad muffler pull up to the stop sign and turn right.   Then I went into blackness again but after a time, how much time I don't know, I heard two voices. One voice said, How did he get here? and the other said he didn't know. Then, the first said we need to put him back. I got the weird impression that they were like maintenance people but inter-dimensional?  And then I was back. While the voices were talking and I was in the blackness I couldn't feel my body or see anything. I didn't seem to have any panic or anything. I suppose it was like being put on a shelf like a doll.   As my friend and I walked up to about ten feet before the corner a man came out and watered his lawn and the same car with a bad muffler pulled up and turned right. This time I wasn't at the end of the street. I thought about that for years. Why was I at the end of the street alone and now I'm ten feet from the corner with my friend but the same things are happening. You can probably guess. It's likely because I walk faster when I'm alone.  I'm sure if I took a lie detector test I would pass. I know these aren't false memories. I have no history of mental illness and it doesn't run in my family."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,TriumphantGeorge,5,Tue Jun 16 16:48:36 2015 UTC,I would like to hear it!
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,UnderAStormySky,8,Tue Jun 16 20:48:41 2015 UTC,"I have a voice that began talking to me over eight years ago.  I am 62 years old now.  He talks to me at that moment of waking (most often) just after dreaming but not completely awake yet.  He tells me the answers to things I think about that I ponder on or (at times) is upset about.  He also gives me predictions of things to come mostly on a personal base but sometimes about the world.  About a year ago I heard him talking to someone else.  He was unaware that I could hear him at the time and when he realized I was lustening to the conversation,  he paused a long time and then said something and ended it.  I could only hear his side of the conversation.  But I could tell by what he said what the other had replied.  The voice I could not hear was saying something about it not being good for me to know the things he was telling me.  The other person was saying something along the lines that I was no longer was lving my life as I should.  Knowing to much kept my head in the clouds and not on firm earth.  My voice argued with the other saying he didn't think it hurt me so much etc.  But it looks like the other voice won out as I haven't heard him again.  I sometimes feel his hand on me while I am sleeping.  I wake up from the pressure of it.  Last night I stirred and found someone lifting the cover and putting it on me.  I first thought it was our little dog routing around but my foot nudged him and he was sleeping.  I then thought it was my husband but he too was sleeping.  No one was there yet the blanket was tucked around me and I felt it as it moved around me.  When I went to bed it was very hot so I threw off the blanket.  In the night it became cooler and that's when the blanket was moved around me just like someone carefully raising it to tuck someone in.  He is very gentle and I miss his company.  Maybe one day he will come back and talk with me.  I told my doctor about him and she said if he wasn't telling me to do violent things then I was not suffering mental illness.  This voice is but a very small part of oddities.  I remember sitting on my lawn chair (we live out in the country) and a huge group of people (about a hundred or more) were walking through my property wearing formal modern cloths. They were heading to the back the property.  They were gathering for some kind of revival meeting?  I wasn't sure.  One guy passed me with an angry look on his face making me understand I didn't belong there.  I knew I had transfered again to another time space that shared my property in their lives as well as mine.  It had happened before with other strange people that was different than this group.  I always considered my property an exit property.  It was like a vortex of sorts.  When it snowed, the snow lasted longer on it by a week than our neighbors.  It seemed to storm more on us as well.  It was an odd property but I never felt threasten.  I felt kinda blessed.  I think we use the same property here in our time space as others use the same space in theirs similar to the harry potters world champ ball game but its divided far more than twice.  What tree I cut down here is reflected as phenomenon there and vice versa.  Some areas are stronger than others.  Do you think lay lines have anything to do with it?  Very strange indeed."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,The_Kazekage,2,Wed Jun 17 03:49:50 2015 UTC,"You may find this book informative. According to Seth, we cannot even comprehend how much larger we are than we believe we are, and how much more there is to us.

There are infinite other versions of us in realities both similar and different, and yet all these personalities are part of the same soul."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,vaginal_milk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:43:56 2015 UTC,"Great! :-) I wonder about your thoughts when you come to that part. I think these concepts are first discussed perhaps 30 - 50% into the book.  I don't have personal multiverse experience of my own, so I'm having some trouble wrapping my mind about these ideas. Seth presents them rather casually - you know, that's just how it is, there's an infinite number of yous, and they're all you, and you get to choose your own reality, and the future is now, and the past is now too. I personally find all this a bit overwhelming. I wonder if you find it more easily graspable, given your personal experience.  I read another set of books, The Ra Material, which describes a universe which may or may not be the same as Seth's; I cannot say for certain. There are apparent differences, most specifically that Seth does not speak about density levels, and does not make a distinction between service-to-self and service-to-others, which is very prominent in the Ra books. However, the cosmology appears to be fundamentally compatible, in that Ra also discuss time as having a completely different nature outside of our incarnation; and they discuss your higher self as being a sixth-density entity, which you have thus far not reached, but the higher self nevertheless already exists, and does guide you.  Paradoxical stuff; hard for me to comprehend without anything more than pedestrian experience of some weird telepathy and occasional unmistakable gut feelings. I wonder how you'll find this information. :-)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39yigi,peptosan,2,Wed Jun 17 03:54:29 2015 UTC,I would think of isolating selves as in being human in a similar way to lying to yourself and believing the lie. But once your done you merge back into your whole self or wake up. The future and past are like single frames in a movie. You can focus on a frame and in this case unlike film actually be there.

It's when the output loops directly back to the input, rather than flowing as downwash.   If it happens to you, your craft falls like a rock.  Perhaps your fan was installed a bit too close to the ceiling?   It must get trapped in ""loop mode"" with zero lifting force, instead of ""trying to take off through the ceiling"" mode.    If it happens again, just disturb the vortex ring by swatting at it with a magazine.   Or just pucker up and blow (but off-center!)"

This happened to me in high school: I was coming home from a county fair with a few of my friends, we took two cars. One of the cars, a Misubishi Galant, had abour 4 people in it so it was relatively full. The other car had only 2 people, I went to go into the car with the least amount of people, sat down in the back seat and I felt EXTREMELY uneasy. So much so that I quickly got out of the car and walked over to the Galant and squeezed in. While we were on the road following the other car in the reservation near my house (New Jersey Watchung Reservation), we witnessed it swerve off the road suddly and almost go down a cliff, it hit a guard rail and spun into a tree. The two guys in that car were okay, but the entire backseat was completely destroyed. They said the car just automatically lost control and there was nothing they could do.. Very weird"

Plato's cave suggests a ""real reality"" that we see indirectly. However, it implies a separation between experience and an underlying reality which needn't exist: your direct sensory experience right now might be all there is.

I asked my husband, just in case he accidentally threw it out or did something with it, but he always asks me before throwing anything away, and he said he hadn't touched anything in the storage bench.   Also, yesterday, I asked him to bring me a bottle of water, and we buy those six packs of Fiji, and there were two left, so I watched him take them both out and throw the plastic wrapping away and he brought me one bottle and I opened it and took a few sips. Then later I was coming down the stairs and saw the other bottle on the kitchen counter and grabbed it and brought it back to the couch where the other bottle was, because I knew I'd drink two.

At that point, it's the basis for the pentatonic scale which is found in all musical scales around the world. There are a ton of songs that sound like this.  ""Fight For Your Right (to Party)"" by The Beastie Boys uses a riff that's very similar to this.  ""They Say I'm Different"" by Betty Davis is very similar too.  It sounds even more like ""Maria Quiet"" by Astrud Gilberto.

The song appears in Konami Guitar Freaks 4th Mix. A cover version of ""Smoke on the Water"" is one of the playable songs for the PlayStation 2 game Guitar Hero. The same cover version is a downloadable track in Guitar Hero II for the Xbox 360. It is featured in Guitar Hero Smash Hits as a master track. It is available on Wii's Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 as a minigame, without Verse 3. It is also featured in Rock Band 3 as a master track. The song is also available as a downloadable track for the guitar game Rocksmith. [citation needed] It is a playable song in the PlayStation 2 game SingStar Rocks!. The song is playable in the online game Stick Dudes Gone Wild: Rock Band.

So far in my dreams (I hope they are dreams) I have:  1) Crashed in to my neighbors fence (exactly 1 week before a drunk driver did the exact same thing as in my dream)  2) Dozed off on the way home from some group Christmas function and crashed  3) Rear-end a white PT Cruiser (causing a somewhat irrational fear of them now)  4) Several times was left alone in a bronco that is going backwards off a cliff or in to the woods  5) Died on a train crash in the 1900's from broken glass  I also had a dream where I was basically doing a replay of my entire life, a life I have not lived yet, and a voice told me, ""Wake up dreamscape user.  We're ready to try again,"" like I just got a total reset of several decades.    I'm telling you man, there's something to these theories.  I've heard people IRL who don't know about this site talk about crazy resets where they died or witnessed the death of a close relative and a split second later everything is either okay or not as bad."

Since the dream was mundane, he could have woken up and thought he remembered doing certain things in the dream just because they're part of his normal day. If someone asked you what you did last Saturday morning, you would probably just say what you typically do on a Saturday morning even if you didn't remember it (unless you did something unusual and non-mundane that Saturday)."

Sometimes we feel weird in a dream, when we aren't lucid yet, because something about the dream is off, but we don't know what it is. The wibbly wobbly time you described also points to a dream.  I'd suggest you start a (dream) diary and update it as soon as you wake up, so you can distinguish the events in the dreamworld better from the real world and know for sure which things happened where."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39p49n,Aroha11,3,Sat Jun 13 15:23:02 2015 UTC,"Reddit reloaded the page as I was typing a huge reply, so I have shorted it a little ...   I do not need a diary, as since the teenager-age I was reading about controlling dreams, using a technique to keep saying to yourself that you are awake in specific intervals. As I became more used to this, I started to be able to control my dreams in such a matter, that... I have complete control over everything. I can control the people who are inside, I can control what they are wearing, hell I can even change the environment, changing the location and teleporting myself to other places! (To give you some information, think of it like ""Inception"" but with your own mind. You have full control of everything happening. As I was changing more and more stuff, it took me more and more energy, leading to horrible headache the next day and sometimes even made me pass out on the next day, if I was too extreme with changes. First you start altering little things, like clothes or put a tree or remove it. Then you will make yourself have super abilities, like being able to run fastly, then to fly, and then finally to teleport. At one point I was able to time-travel in my dreams, which made it all even more complicated)   Back to the topic, since I was doing all of this stuff back then and training myself, I knew exactly I was being awake, which also indicates me not waking up by trying to hurt myself.   I've also had lucid dreams, which I may share with you guys later.   (To be honest, I don't actually expect anyone to believe anything I write here. I wrote it because that's what happened with me in my opinion and nobody that I told believed me either, because it seemed too ""abnormal"". The world is a messy place and I thought some may be interested or have similiar experience)"

What probably happened was that if you have just flashes of things happening, your mind fills the gaps when you wake up, making it seem like you actually dreamt for longer than you were asleep. Or like when you sleep and doesn't have a dream, and you wake up instantly after you just closed your eyes, if 8 hours can pass on a blink of an eye, nothing prevents it from stretching the time perception while asleep."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39p49n,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"It could have happened, but since I woke up exactly on the next day I should've normally wake up, and nothing in my life changed even slightly, also the fact that I wouldn't be able to prove if it was real or not, coupled with the fact that the other me made decisions I wouldn't make at all and since I just had the role of some kind of spectator of my own actions and not making actual decisions, I assume it was a dream.  If somehow I choose to believe that was real, I would also have to believe the earth was countless times destroyed by aliens, ended on several zombie apocalypses, and that I have the power to fly as long as I was already falling.  There's also several other possibilities as well, quantum death(if I'm not mistaken with the term) would help explain that, as if I died and then reset it back to the period that initiated the decisions that led me to my death. Could also be that I glimpsed on another version of me on a parallel universe.  Dream is the most logical one and simpler."

Me and a friend heard my dog going mental in response to a knock at the door, heard my sister open the door and have a conversation with a guy with a deep voice. Couldn't make out the conversation, just the tones.  Being nosy teenagers, afterwards we went out to ask who it had been and neither my sister, or my mother, knew what we were talking about. The dog was dozing - no way they missed him barking and tearing up the hallway, he was one loud bastard.  If it had just been my sister, I would have assumed she was lying. If it had just been me who heard it, I would have assumed I'd had some sort of mental moment - but my mother wouldn't lie about shit like that and my friend heard it as well as I did.

They were all adamant that they were always in the apartment where they are now, at the other end of the hallway. Photos from their Facebook pages also show them goofing around outside their ""current"" apartment, and these photos are dated on the first night everyone spent at the dorm (about a week before the mystery conversation outside the disappearing flat). They even captioned the photos as being ""outside our apartment"".  One of the weirdest things though, about a week after this phantom conversation with them, our dorm floor had an organized pizza night at a reastraunt in town. I talked with the people from the ""phantom flat"", and they continued the conversation I rememebr from outside the phantom flat. Specifically they asked me how my law courses were going (what I had told them I am studying). So I am almost 100% certain that the conversation outside the mystery flat occured.

But then by some miracle wormhole action you actually did go into your room but through the bottom right door.

I could see the elevators and the other end of the hallway while I had the conversation with them. The elevators were still on my side of the hallway, and I was looking to my right, so it is impossible to have been standing next to their real flat."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39ixuy,VeniVidiIvi,4,Fri Jun 12 22:24:15 2015 UTC,"So I'm looking at your drawing, and having a really hard time understanding the floor plan of the place. You say you heard coughing and such coming from the phantom apartment? How far to the right of your door is your wall? And how far left is the furthest wall of the stairwell once you're inside? Are the doors right across the hall from each other, or are they staggered so that you can't see straight across into someone's flat if both doors are open?   It would be weird for a dorm to have a big unused area like that. They're designed to fit the maximum number of people into the smallest square footage, and usually do a pretty good job of it."

But I had this image in my mind that there was room for another apartment. This is because the apartment on the OTHER side (left side) of mine, appears to fit into a 10-15ft space before the hallway ends. I have since realized that it actually extends for another 10ft past the end of the hallway, but this is not visible unless you are in the apartment. Here is a better map, also with the stairwell corrected to show how it is impossible to see from outside my apartment.  http://imgur.com/w9PQ86z"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39jyjc,TriumphantGeorge,3,Sat Jun 13 05:58:46 2015 UTC,"I do like the phrase ""Observer Permanence"" (or ""Persistence"").  I guess we always need to be careful about defining the ""observer"" in these sorts of descriptive schemes. It is not a physical body that gets reset and continues, obviously. It's more that a ""conscious perspective"" always persists and that there is always a ""next moment"" of experience.   Usually that ""next moment"" is pretty close to the previous moment, but when there is no logical next moment available  (e.g. because the assumed observer, the body, is not going to be around) then things get a little discontinuous.  It's as if you are traversing a vast grid of all possible experiences by scanning your attention across it. You keep going along a trajectory across the grid until you hit a point where it doesn't make sense, then there's a shift. Perhaps you ""don't die after all"". Perhaps you do have an ""experience of dying"" and either end up experiencing some other land, or you start experiencing ""someone else's body"", maybe struggling to hold onto the previous memory when you do so.[1]  No matter what, experiences keep arising within this ""conscious perspective"" or ""experiencing aware space"" that you really are. Basically, there is always more dream.[2][3]  Notes  [1] So many everyday glitches involve an ""urge to forget"" or a difficulty in remembering. This may simply because it is hard to reach memories that don't ""make sense"" relative to the present experience. There is a very tenuous path between the two ""patterns"" of experience. If you had a fully discontinuous event, you would not have access to any residual glow from your previous state at all - when you did try to recall, you'd simply find confusion, or ""memories"" appearing consistent with your current state, created by the implication of you looking for them.  [2] Since the dream continues forever (more accurately: there just is no time), then at some point you are going to realise the state of things: that you are a ""perceptual dream space"" and dream content is appearing spontaneously within you. You might eventually realise that this means you can direct the dream. Eventually though, this might get boring - the emptiness of illusory challenges and danger - and you would actively choose to forget your true nature, and re-identify as a limited dream character.  [3] This also highlights that the world you apparently live in does not follow a ""simple-sharing model"". It is more like exploring an evolving pattern than living in a stable world with people and as a person."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39jyjc,Pravosudie,2,Fri Jun 12 08:26:07 2015 UTC,"I feel observer is a pretty good word, but both consciousness and observation, while not necessarily pointing to a physical necessity (bodies be throwaways as we jump to a new timeline/reality) And both can be lost with unconsciousness and during the black out period of the reset. I actually would be quite comfortable calling it Experiential Persistence.    I definitely agree with you that there is a next moment, and that there's always more dream and that it will try to stay continuous as best it can but it has no problem with being more discontinuous.   I'm not quite able to comment fulling on the urge to forget section. My experiences with experiential persistence never had an urge to forget and were never drastic enough to massively change my time line aside from small key events. However I will say that the urge to forget would not be documented as much, because individuals won't remember the events and the changes before and after. In fact, the urge to forget glitch follows the limitations and trends of quantum immortality, of just happening and not noticing they happened. I don't know how much of memory is purely based in the physical body, and how much in the experiencing consciousness, because there are definitely leftover memories from alternative events. I don't know how robust memories are through experiential persistence, but I feel like awareness could lead to an ability to keep it. Again, my experiences with this haven't led to something massive enough to cause major dissonance with my life. I have no idea if people that enter a drastically different reality can ""remember"" their past from that reality to build coherence, etc.   I do actually disagree that there's no time, infinite of something does not mean there's zero of it, those are actually different limits, but they are connected inversely usually. There are infinite experiences and these experiences take time, thus infinite traverse of time.   I disagree that it is one dream just changing settings as well, I would suggest it's actually a multiverse set up with connected through consciousness sharing, people move in and out of other's universes as it pertains to maintaining experiential persistence. Evidence for my suggestion includes people entering into the universe from others (Mandela effects you yourself don't agree with) and alternative time lines and pasts that are noticeably different, with alternative arrangements of objects/people/nouns after a death reboot. I heavily disagree it is a sole lone adventurer surrounded by aspects of themselves in one changing iteration, and more like hopping servers in an MMORPG."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39jyjc,occultchicken,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:38:37 2015 UTC,"Consciousness & Persistence   I actually would be quite comfortable calling it Experiential Persistence.   Yes. Hmm. Although I suppose it's the fact of experience that persists, even if it is a ""blank"" experience for a while. The thing that truly persists is ""that which experiences"".  The reason I am being explicitly cautious about descriptions of the observer is that, upon examination, it's fairly easy to realise you aren't a located observer in a situation, and what you ""are"" can't really be described in terms of content. We have to be careful to distinguish between the uses of the word ""consciousness"":   Consciousness-of - The content you are aware of. This is includes perceptions, sensations, thoughts. Self-consciousness - The identification of one part of that content as ""you"". Consciousness - The ""stuff"" from which experience is made and that-which-experiences. Upon investigation, this turns out to be all there is and what you-the-experiencer really are - ""taking on the shape of experiences"".   This isn't necessary for a vague idea of Experiential Persistence, but for making sense of the details it's required I think. Of vital importance is that we think of this from a 1st-person subjective perspective. The reason is that there is no 3rd-person objective view of this that can ever be experienced. We need to be more careful than usual to distinguish between reality (actual experience) and imaginary (thoughts about experience) here.  The phenomenon is inherently ""before time and space"". Time and space are aspects of the observer experience. They are ""in"" the observer; the observer is not ""in"" time and space. (You can actually notice this directly, however you can't think-about it, because thinking about it immediately implies time and space, since we think with ""shadow senses"".)  In our descriptions we must be careful not to just imagine a ""universe out there"" that is a continuation of the form of our 3d-sensory experience, seen by no-one.  Urge To Forget / Hard To Remember   However I will say that the urge to forget would not be documented as much, because individuals won't remember the events and the changes before and after.   Only those who retained access to the memory can report it, of course. I think it probably takes two forms: A genuine discomfort in the clash between one's current experience and the prior experience, or simply that the ""thread"" connecting the two is weak. The more substantial the discontinuity the harder it probably is for a bridge to remain.  We can see this even in normal life: people walking through a door or other transitional experience, and not being able to remember what they were doing. A shift of attention, the context is lost, it's hard to get from ""this"" to ""that"" again. The extreme version is that you're not even aware there is a ""that"" to go looking for.   I do actually disagree that there's no time.   We have to be a little careful here. There is no time for the world-pattern overall because there is no external reference point. There is only change between one part and another part. If the whole world-pattern shifts, there will be no record of it.   Parts of experience can be measured against other parts of experience, but overall experiences do not occur in time.  I'd say that ""time"" only exists in thought. We reflect upon our experiences and do so by treating memories as objects (""events"") and arranging them in mental space (e.g. a ""timeline""). However, there is no such space other than our thinking of it.   Multiverses vs A Shifting Dream   I disagree that it is one dream just changing settings as well   It's really a matter of definitions and perspective. From the point of view of the experiencer, it's a dream that is changing form. Things like ""multiverses"" and ""timelines"" are just ways of thinking-about those changes, categorising particular shifts in experience.   And remember: there is no point of view other than that of the experiencer. There is no available experience of standing apart and ""seeing all the timelines and multiverses"". They are a faux-objective fictional construction we use to make sense of subjective experience. These ideas are themselves ""inside"" subjective experience even though they are supposedly about an ""outside"" to it.  Really, all of our experiences are remarkably fluid. If we could log it in detail would discover that, in effect, each of us is living in a different world relative to one another. Our personal world-patterns are, when compared to everyone else's in fine detail, one total Mandela Effect.  If we were going with the MMORPG metaphor, it would be a peer-to-peer arrangement where each of us is living in our own instantiation, with quite limited interaction with other peers - no central servers. (In fact, Marcus Arvan has used this as a basis for a paper: short version and extended version.)  EDIT: Did a few edits to rework this; first draft was on mobile and not very coherent. Probably not much better :-)"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39jyjc,X9DarkWolf,2,Sat Jun 13 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"Ok. Here's mine. In 1990 I was living in Madison, Wisconsin. We had a blizzard and the roads were icy. I decided I needed a pizza so my girlfriend and I ventured down town around 8 pm. After eating we left the pizza place. At University Ave. We waited at the light. The light turned green and we started walking.   I heard a scream and looked across the street. I saw a woman staring to my right. I followed her gaze and saw a car driving very fast through the intersection and we were directly in the path of the car. Time seemed to slow down. My girlfriend grabbed my cost sleeve. I remember thinking we di dont have that much time. Here's where it gets even stranger. I remembered thinking that this was wrong. This wasn't ""supposed"" to happen. It wasn't part of the plan. SOMETHING was breaking the rules. If this something could then I could stop pretending to be only me.  So I suddenly grew or raised above us and the car. I mentally zoomed my vision into the car. I saw a man playing with his car radio and distracted. But, I also saw or felt the residue of a spirit creature that had intentionally distracted him. I yelled at him mentally to look up. He did. Suddenly I was back in my body and the guy in the car slammed on his breaks fish tailing believe it or not around us. His bumper was only an inch away from me at one point. I give him credit for his driving skills.  My girlfriend,who later became my wife exclaimed how lucky we were.  I no longer remember what the pretending was all about. I forgot, I assume, on purpose. I'm not supposed to know what I was in that brief moment.  I never told my wife. I never told anyone. I would deny it actually if anyone asked me about it. Its too weird. Don't get me wrong, I've had so many things happen as weird as this that I could write a book. I just want to be normal, you know? So I keep it to myself.

From a glitch perspective, it could be that your daughter at some point in space/time/probability WAS in fact sitting on that couch, and the moment you were in when you saw her was informationally connect to that other moment. However, when you moved on from that moment, you entered another moment that for whatever reason offered a different perspective on your daughter's location, I.e. was connected to another moment informationally. Hopefully the following clip will clarify a bit what I mean. https://youtu.be/YycAzdtUIko  Another option that so far hasn't been presented, would be your daughter bi-located or somehow projected to where you saw her. There isn't much evidence for these types of events that isn't anecdotal, unfortunately, and the mechanism for such a thing is basically undefined. In my opinion, it would require a consciousness outside of mechanical reality which brings it into the realm of spirituality. Not saying it is impossible though.  The last option I can think of that is likely the most probable, is that there was a brain glitch and the experience of seeing your daughter doesn't actually reflect reality. There is of course no way for anyone to know this except you, and even then you already know that your observation didn't match the reality of your daughter's location, but the mechanism is still unclear."

It is kept on all night for the dogs.   I have read the responses above (thank you) and it is possible that she could have gone back up stairs while I was in the restroom as I was only in there for a few minutes. She could have changed her clothes in her sleep, if so she wouldn't have remembered doing so. She hasn't had a history of sleep walking but this is a possibility as well.

My youngest didn't speak to her as she passed the room and it was only after she walked out and didn't see her did she realize that Kayla wasn't home, but was already at work.  Not to muddle the waters, but there is a documented murder that took place on our property site in 1868. Our home was built over the previous farmhouse in the 1970's with no other deaths noted.

The personal value of glitches for me is that it makes you get curious about why that should happen. Why should you experience time and space a bit differently than your daughter might have?  I guess you could burn some incense and worry a bit about the ghosts of murder victims playing pranks on you... but it seems like a waste of a good question to me!

And that's just from your perspective. Wouldn't he recognize the younger version of himself in an instant?   I am pretty sure most people would recognize a much older/younger of themselves quite easily. This story is not credible at all."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,39cma8,yeah_but_no,9,Wed Jun 10 22:41:33 2015 UTC,If it was a future you he probably knew this was going to happen so he didn't say anything.

The conversation was very natural, like chatting with an old friend, and there was an unspoken, but tangible depth and weightiness to the moment.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,394r47,IAdventureTimeI,3,Thu Jun 11 15:57:06 2015 UTC,"Only while reading this post... As soon I read the first few sentences, I immediately saw the number 4 in my mind's eye.  I then felt the number 18 but couldn't see it, then visualized the 4 again quite persistently.   Edit: if details matter, I saw the 4 pretty much as you described... It was written in medium font in black sharpie on a notecard, and the notecard was sitting on a dark wood desk in an office.  Cool idea, btw!"

It's a bit different from yours, but the color, texture, etc is extremely similar.  I'll chalk this up to an intriguing coincidence, but I've had a few moments of clairvoyance in my life so maybe there's something to it.  Who knows? I didn't see that 9 at the end, so my intuition certainly needs some honing."

When we were younger [like 9-12], my middle brother and I would be in the back seat of the car while my dad was driving us somewhere...and at times, we'd hear each other whisper our own names. [Like...He'd whisper his name, I'd whisper mine apparently. It wasn't like we were trying to freak the other one out by whispering their name.] ...But neither of us had said anything. We'd usually just end up looking at each other like ""...wtf did you say your name for?"" This was usually right after we'd been talking and the conversation died.  The other thing was with my youngest brother a few years ago. I'd be doing whatever on my computer, or drawing, not saying anything or listening to music or anything. He'd come into my room randomly and say ""Yes?""...and when I'd look confused he'd ask, ""Wait...you didn't just yell for me?""...when I definitely didn't. Granted, he's really spacy and doesn't pay all that much attention usually. But it happened almost everyday for nearly a month at one point.  I'm sure they could be easily explained [like the first one could've been my brother messing with me, though I never saw his mouth move when I'd hear him.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,38y8hv,TriumphantGeorge,4,Mon Jun 8 09:45:11 2015 UTC,"2007: I start working on the story and set it in 2008. Some of the characters have PDA's to share information over long distances. A week later, Apple announces the first Iphone and Ipad.  A few months down the line I've wound the story backwards in order to flesh out the story. I come up with a space plane to make the space portions of the story to work. I came up with a ""Revolver"" type aircraft engine which starts off like a normal jet engine and transitions into a hypersonic engine and eventually a rocket engine for sub orbital / low orbit travel.  Skylon was announced 3 days later, and it turns out i'd described the XB70 without realising it.  An as yet unwritten portion of the story takes place on Mars, and so I was working out how to keep the astronauts safe from cosmic rays and other nastiness, so I got to thinking about magnetic shielding. The next day a scientist releases a paper saying pretty much the same thing.  One of the setttings for my story involves a highly implausible setting of a gas giant between the Kuiper Belt and the Oort cloud for some aliens to hide and repair their ship. According the Phil Plait of ""Bad Astronomy"" something like that may actually exist.  I describe at the start of my story a spaceship full of dials and gauges which makes it to low orbit, and I was informed it sounds like an early Apollo mockup.  I invented a mega corporation for my story, which I know call the ""Foundation for Peace and Brotherhood"" the back story being they started in Italy after the black death as a way for neighbours to help each other out, and over time it spread and gained influence etc etc.  The original name was ""The Medici Foundation"" as I knew a little about history and thought it would be a good name to use. But guess what?  There's other small things as well, like the ""Lunar Ion Freighter"" from 1959, which i thought at the time I would have had to defend to the death, but it seems that could have existed.  Those are a few things, sorry for the wall of text."

There's something about writing fiction in particular which makes this phenomenon more apparent. Perhaps because it's a process where you are inherently more aware of what you are imagining.  It's always hard to tell the difference between these ideas being part of a ""larger movement"" or whether our thoughts ""pattern"" our subsequent experience. I've been experimenting a little with (so-called) synchronicity and generating it deliberately. Lots of fun to be had."

Check out this interview with him also. (Jung had his ideas, his concept of 'active imagination', and did interesting work with physicist Wolfgang Pauli, but I don't think his model was a good one; he stopped short. I think he was actually a little frightened of the implications, and what it might do to the perceived respectability of his work.)  I've already posted a link to my comment, but you might find my post on The Patterning of Experience and related links worth a look for one direction to take this.  You might also find this PDF article on hypnogogia interesting (text version here). This phenomenon is tightly related to synchronicity in ""functional"" terms I think. The Mavromatis thesis it references is available for download in PDF: Volume 1 and Volume 2.

Like, things like space planes and tablet computers have been around forever in science fiction, and were used to a less popular extent before the ipad in real life. And I mean, ""a spaceship full of dials and gauges which makes it to low orbit"" isn't that pretty much any spaceship? And like, a ramjet doesn't work by cycling engines like the chambers on a revolver, rather the different engines can be thought of as being one on top of each other, and the XB-70 didn't use ramjets, you're probably thinking of the SR-71.   edit: That medicifoundation think definitely is weird, however."

In Graham Hancocks, Entangled, a novel he writes about the Neanderthals in depth and detail that no one had ever described before as having red hair and strong social connections, including inner breading with humanoids. A couple of years after writing his novel these qualities were in fact found to be true through archeological exploration. The implications of this are mind blowing. Did he affect the ancient past with his powerful ability to visualize?   It seems very possible that through the power of the creative mind, reality takes form. That the ""Matrix"" may have a running program that uses our imagination to create themes and story lines. The power of conscious creation is amazing, but what is unnerving is that the shadow/unconscious is also inputting content into creation.  I shudder. :D"

Thinking about this, it's not necessarily ""the past"" that gets affected, it's that subsequent observations take the form of previous ones. Even if a discovery is ""about the past"" it is really an observation of something in the present.  So, Hancock ""has the experience of"" writing about about red-haired Neanderthals. Later, he ""has the experience of"" reading about an archeological exploration which finds red-haired Neanderthals. The ""past"" is nowhere to be found in this description except as ""the experience of"" thinking about the ""past"", in his imagination. All three experiences occur in the present, one after the other.  Once Hancock has invented the ""fact"" of red-haired Neanderthals, all subsequent observations will be consistent with this new ""fact"" (even though he made it up)."

Those explanations are just stories you invent to connect different observations. Also, don't separate out inside or outside: If you are experiencing anything, then it's a pattern arising in your ""perceptual space"" - it's all in the same ""place"".   Looked at this way, it's like Hancock created a pattern in his ""perceptual space"" which then persisted, intermingling with and superimposed upon the other patterns that were going on - one of which was ""reading about archeology"". (Like mentioned in the link I posted above.)  He then ascribes meaning to this (via concepts of ""the past"" and ""a world"") but really there are no such things. Only patterns swirling around and unfolding in his perceptions.  Of course, this brings up issues of identity and how the world is ""shared"" between us, if patterns in Hancock's experience result in patterns in our experience. This is solved if: there is no difference, there is no Hancock, or you, only perceptual patterns in one conscious space.  [1] Okay, so I guess that's simple in the sense of ""there are only patterns"" but not very simple to describe and think about! :-)"

Also the difference between your example is that they lacked ways of observing the world around them at a smaller level, seeing a creature change in size, and maturity back and forth requires only observation with the naked eye, which would be something already seen on the thousands of documentaries about Wild life, where one animal hunts the other one, therefore putting it in danger and triggering that ability.

Likely influenced by the writings of Hermann Helmholtz, it was invented by American ophthalmologist Adelbert Ames, Jr. in 1934, and constructed in the following year.  An Ames room is viewed with one eye through a pinhole such as to avoid any clues from stereopsis, and it is constructed so that from the front it appears to be an ordinary cubic-shaped room, with a back wall and two side walls parallel to each other and perpendicular to the horizontally level floor and ceiling. However, this is a trick of perspective and the true shape of the room is trapezoidal: the walls are slanted and the ceiling and floor are at an incline, and the right corner is much closer to the front-positioned observer than the left corner (or vice versa). (See overhead view diagram to the right)  As a result of the optical illusion, a person standing in one corner appears to the observer to be a giant, while a person standing in the other corner appears to be a dwarf. The illusion is so convincing that a person walking back and forth from the left corner to the right corner appears to grow or shrink.

Remember that you can't trust your senses 100%, they are all made based on nature hacks, fail often and are full of bugs, specially sight, magicians been fooling people for ages based mostly on that. Even if it was recorded, but it was from only one angle it couldn't be fully trusted.

Additional thoughts:  Some experiments with 'natural' vision improvement amount to improving the ""memory"" of objects, the better to have them triggered by the eyes (and also bring about eye relaxation in the process). Which make sense, if we do or can ""perceive with the mind overall"", more than just  ""see with the eyes / visual cortex"". We might end up experiencing a combination of the two: The 'raw' input and then the 'related perceptual information' as well.  Side note: Seemingly sometimes those who have improved their vision this way still have the same retinoscopy results, even though their vision has been recovered. This implies they have just learned to shift their attention to ""perception"" rather than ""raw input""?"

Sometimes these missing items even turn up again in a totally impossible place but it seems unlikely that you would even recognize a plain envelope if you came across it again.  I don't want to be crazy myself, but I'm inclined to believe that this is not a supernatural phenomenon or people being mistaken, and is just a natural phenomenon. I wish some real scientific research could be done on this subject because I honestly feel like it's too common not to be real.  You're not crazy. Either objects literally have the ability to slip out of our observable reality (or whatever happens to them when they go) or you are simply mistaken and there is an envelope hiding somewhere in your bathroom. I genuinely believe that you could be correct about there being nowhere for it to go, but that's just me. Thinking about it enough will probably drive you ""crazy"" though!

I search for about 15 minutes because I was so baffled and wanted to solve the ""mystery"" of where the hell it went, and how. I didn't care about the pen, it was just bizarre and impossible at the same time that it wasn't right there, on the floor. After a while, I gave up.  Fast forward a week, a TV remote slipped down a radiator on the opposite side of the room. I poked down the back of the radiator with the end of a golf club to knock it out, which I did, but to my amazement the missing pen came rolling out with it.  There was no way the pen could have gotten there. I dropped it down vertically and right beside me, this radiator was over the other side of the room and of course elevated off the floor.

Now, being a rental car, this car was sparkling clean. We crawled all over the floor and looked in the cracks, I could see clear under the seats, and it absolutely wasn't anywhere. We reported it to the rental car company when we returned the car, and they weren't able to find the knife either.  A few years later, another kitchen knife that we bought mysteriously disappeared the same way; when we took the stuff we'd bought out of the car, the knife was gone.

The best way I've had it explained to me is that it's like kids are on one big acid trip, which actually makes sense considering people believe that having your third eye open releases dmt into the brain.

The way Op worded the post, again only Op heard a voice after being told about it. The sister and mother (if either of them weren't just making it all up) both talked about their experiences at the same time, after returning home from work and school. This means that while Op could have been influenced from suggestion, the mother and sister had similar yet separate experiences.   All that being said, I do agree that hallucination/imagination is the best explanation. Hearing your name called is a pretty common stress response. Anything from lack of sleep to too much caffeine could cause this kind of thing, given that as far as hallucinations go it's pretty mild and fairly common. If it keeps happening, that might be cause for concern or harder to explain... depending on what the dr's had to say."

Otherwise, same height (6'4""), same hair colour (bleached as well), same haircut, clothing style and identical facial features - nose, eyes, teeth, etc. I'd taken lots of art classes in high school so I know how to really look at a face; some people just see outlines.  Even more freaky, he tried to chat me up, though admittedly because the resemblance was so uncanny, I'd been glancing at him all night.  Found out later he was friend a of a friend of a good friend of mine, though unfortunately I was never able to get them to meet.  Another friend of mine had a picture of her double taken by someone they knew in common. When she showed it to her own parents, they said when did you ever have curly hair? Other than the hairstyle, the face and even the way the girl held herself was identical.  I saw my own look-alike once, when walking down Holloway Road in London.

Often described as the opposite of déjà vu, jamais vu involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. Jamais vu is sometimes associated with certain types of aphasia, amnesia, and epilepsy.  Jamais vu is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognise a word or, less commonly, a person or place, that she or he knows.  This can be achieved by anyone by repeatedly writing or saying a specific word out loud. After a few seconds one will often, despite knowing that it is a real word, feel as if ""there's no way it is an actual word"".

For a moment, everything was wrong, i.e. ""Who the hell are they? They didn't make that song!"" etc. Then I panicked out of confusion, but it all came back to normal after a few minutes.  A few weeks ago, I was watching a random YouTube clip, and suddenly it felt like someone injected a thousand thoughts into my brain at once. I recognised the mental images and knew I had thought those thoughts, but it was impossible that I could have in that short time span.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,38iosj,mastersyrron,15,Thu Jun 4 13:59:30 2015 UTC,"This post was probably hand-crafted for you!  It highlights that we don't see directly with our eyes. Rather: we experience things as perceptions arising  in our ""mind space"". (Presumably based on a mix of all information we have acquired.)  You can notice this anytime by directing your attention (not your eyes) towards the ""space you look out from"". You'll ""see-feel"" a void space that seems to go on forever. You can also ""feel out"" into the room around you. Although it's probably easiest to explore this idea by closing your eyes and ""reaching out"" to a sound elsewhere in the room. You'll notice that you are both ""here"" and ""beside the sound"", which sits in a sort of open space.  Which leads to the question: If our perception really consists of mind-objects ""inspired by"" information gathered from our senses - sort of a sensory dream built on accumulated guesses - why does vision tend to stop when we close our eyes? Just because we think it should?"

I believe that George is correct about how we interpret observed perceptions, but don't necessarily need them to explore. If you remove sight, you can still ""feel"" your way around. Where you are is in your mind space, and you can actually feel(see through sensory of your awareness) where things are, without explicitly seeing it with your eyes, or touching it with your body.  For me, vision does not stop when my eyes close. I lose context of specific details, but still see shapes and forms and can identify things.  Edit: For what it's worth, this ability to feel has made me an extremely light sleeper. I can feel people before they enter my room, and wake up before they do, completely alert."

Also our perception of the world is nothing more than analyzed data gathered from sensors around the body, which are not limited to the five senses we commonly know, but several more that with time are discovered, so those undiscovered senses could play an important paper on how we ""see"" the world, and some people could have refined versions of those senses.  Like how when you can sense someone approaching you, even though they make no sound and stay out of your sight, but you can feel that something is suddenly different around you that wasn't seconds ago. I noticed this kind of sensory perception very early, to the point that pretty much no one can surprise or scare me all of a sudden these days.

Even if good, the results might be something like people who do astral projection: A mix of accuracy and ""dream-like logic"" muddled together. Perhaps because the experience is closer to ""feeling-knowing-thinking"" than seeing.   Also our perception of the world is nothing more than analyzed data gathered from sensors around the body...   It's probably better to say ""all available information"". The whole body is a continuous sensing-experience (or rather we infer it to be so; we have no access). All of it contributes to sight=perception. When we focus on one aspect then that one ""pops out"" but when we don't we perceive situations rather than sights and sounds.   Like how when you can sense someone approaching you, even though they make no sound and stay out of your sight.   Yes, this is a good indicator of the ""presence"" thing of having an extended ""feel"" of the world. It's as if you can strip all the detailing of an object away, and it will still have a ""there-ness"".  We're unlucky in that our language only primarily lets us communicate about visual and auditory experience. The rest is hard to capture, and so is neglected - we have ended up with the dubious rule of: if you can't of think it as an object, and you can't describe it in words or diagrams, then it's not ""real"".  But ""real"" is what you directly experience, not what you think about experience. I think we're pushing more in the direction of including other things into ""the real"" though."

Here's what the information the story should contain, as described in another book. A reference to an article that appeared in The Illustrated London News would be key:   ""The article refers to the last of the great pterodactyls, theflying dinosaurs of the Mesozoic era.  They existed supposedly around one hundred million years ago in the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic era.  The record states that in France, some workmen, in the winter of 1856, while working on a partially completed railway tunnel between St. Dizey and the Nancy lines, came across something unusual.  In the tunnel, they had broken and removed a huge boulder of Jurassic limestone, which precedes the Cretaceous by several million years. After they had broken the limestone, stumbling out of the tunnel toward them was a creature which fluttered its wings, croaked, and collapsed dead at their feet.    ""This creature had a wingspan of ten feet, seven inches, with four legs joined by a membrane like a bat. What should have been feet were long talons.  The mouth was arrayed with sharp teeth.  The skin was black, leathery, oily, and thick. Local students of paleontology immediately identified this creature as being a pterodactyl.    ""This was all reported in The Illustrated London News February 9, 1856, page 156.  They examined the limestone from which the creature had been released and found there a cavity in the exact mold of the creature's body.  If this is true, it is absolutely point of minor importance."""

In reference to the pterodactyl story, though, Chris Nedin (Dept. of Geology and Geophysics, University of Adelaide) writes on a message board in 1994:   [Quoting another commenter, Chris Nedin says] Mickey writes:  The total reference for the book is  Panorama of Creation Carl E. Baugh, PH.D, Creation Evidences Museum 1989. The following quote comes from pages 19-21:  ""In a 1982 Reader's Digest publication, The Mysteries of the Unexplained, it was related that a century ago, a very phenomenal thing occurred.  If this record is correct, and having so many other anomalies, we certainly do not doubt this account (also, it was related in a verifiable publication), this means it is absolutely impossible for evolution to be the explanation of how life forms got here.""   There is then extended quoting of that article. Nedin then goes on to debunk the story, which I've edited a little:   OK, firstly, this story is true. It is true to the extent that it was reported in the Illustrated London News [which the book then sources]. Now, to understand what really happened, a quick history lesson is in order.  During the early to mid 1800's there was great franco-prussian rivalry, in most spheres of life, political, scientific, etc. and geology was no exception.  The profile of France in European geology had dwindled since the death of Cuvier in 1832 and the focus of influence had switched to Germany and Russia(Prussia) with the release of Murchison's book ""The Geology of Russia"" in 1845.  On top of this a small Bavarian location near the town of Solnhofen was producing some exquisite fossils of fish, reptiles and pterodactyls from an Upper Jurassic limestone . . .  Now during this period, many geologists were 'gentlemen' with time and money on their hands. A group of French 'gentlemen geologists' became rather pis* - er, annoyed at all this publicity surrounding the Solnhofen finds and decided to do something about it. Thus when the opportunity presented itself, they took it.  The opportunity can in the construction of a railway tunnel through limestone of the same age as the Solnhofen limestone (Are you begining to see the picture? :-) )  In other words it was a fabrication founded in franco-prussian rivalry.   So in this message the story of the pterodactyl is debunked, but the fact of the story being in a book called The Mysteries of the Unexplained is perhaps confirmed - albeit indirectly via another source. Here is the book they are referring to.   The questions:    Is that the same book that OP is talking about?  And if we got hold of a copy, would it still contain the pterodactyl story?  Or is OP confusing this book and the Mysterious Creatures edition of the Time Life series Mysteries of the Unknown, which maybe does not contain that story (but is sure to have similar mysteries)?   TL;DR: The pterodactyl has been debunked, but the book containing the story has been referred to elsewhere. However, there is a possibility that the original Reader's Digest book is being confused with a Time Life book. It's also possible that the story never contained a picture, but only a vivid description of a picture?"

Even in the Catholic Church that accepts things like exorcism and Marian apparitions-  they seem to rather want to hide them away and not make a big deal about them.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,38cmdb,BlahBlahBlasphemee,3,Wed Jun 3 14:31:59 2015 UTC,"Ehh it's more not making a deal out of it rather them hiding away (because, at least for Christianity, I don't think I've ever seen a pastor deny the paranormal )  Just 2 months ago, one of my pastor's did a sermon which included a retelling of an exorcism he did a few years back. He didnt hide it, but I do think he shared it because it was revelant for that day's lesson. The main reason they avoid talking so much about it is because non-pastors aren't supposed to be practising it (that's not to say they don't believe it's true. Heck, I'm pretty sure there were paranormal instances in the Bible)."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,38cmdb,ShiroiTora,3,Thu Jun 4 05:45:36 2015 UTC,"I would think many of the wonders of the old testament or the miracles of the new would be appropriately described as supernatural.  In the OT,off the top of my head; Jacob's vision of the ladder, the events encompassing the exodus, the fall of Jericho, Elijah calling down fire, Daniel's friends in the fiery furnace, the disembodied hand (writing on the wall), Daniel in the lion's den.  Prophecy itself is supernatural.  A good example of a supernatural event occurring in spite of God's will is King Saul's trip to the witch of En Dor (1 Samuel 28).  A view of the event that I read recently (and it seems to fit nicely) is that, when conducting the seance, the woman is planning on contacting a familiar spirit.  That's why she screams when the actual spirit of Samuel rises up (presumably from Abraham's Bosom)."

Interesting enough, some people debate whether it was Saul's ghost was actually his spirit or not (as some people believe 'ghosts' cant exist but only 'demons or angels that appear in similar likeness'. Excluding the possibility saints and other figures seen in visions, Jesus, Mary, Elijah and Moses might be the only ""exceptions"" (though the former kept their bodies))"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,38cmdb,ShiroiTora,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, some Christians believe spirits of people don't linger too long after death. They then go straight to heaven or hell. There is no in-between. If there is paranormal activity afterwards it's either a message from God and the angels or its the Devil and demonic activity in order to ""trick"" you and make you question your faith. It is not written anywhere but if you question your pastor that is most likely the response you will get.  That was my experience for about 10 years of my life. I don't believe that now but that is what I was taught to believe."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,38cmdb,totally-normal,8,Sat Jun 6 08:39:32 2015 UTC,"Hardly any... although I think you'd be hard-pressed to find them calling it 'paranormal'. Most religions believe in an afterlife, and souls, and divine communication/intervention.   Souls/guardian angels can be seen as religious versions of ghosts and hauntings. 'The afterlife' can be seen as a type of 'otherworldly dimension'.   Then there are the grey areas like demons, possession, and exorcism that are sometimes believed in by both secular and religious people.   I guess the issue would be with semantics. To those who are religious, angels may be real while ghosts are silly (or sacrilege). To the secular who do believe in ghosts, angels might seem ridiculous.   For people who are not religious and don't subscribe to paranormal beliefs, angels seem just as silly as ghosts.    Edit to add: There's also probably people who believe in everything, religious and paranormal combined. That would probably be an exhausting way to live."

For countless times I found things that people were searching for and it was on their field of view at all times. People who use glasses and usually lifts then over and rests then on their heads, often lose their glasses, only for it to be on the top of their heads all the time, someone looking at then can see it clearly, but even though they are directly being touched by it, they don't feel it.

Alternative:  We are living an ongoing, unfolding conscious experience which is built from an accumulation of ""observations"", each of which arises from existing patterns, and implies possible new ones. Gradually, older patterns become stabilised and entrenched as habits, acting as the framework within which sub-patterns unfold. In other words, a world is formed.

The ""rule"" you talk about is just the definition of the word rule, the accepted description of replicable effects, named like that in order to make things understandable according to previous experiences while also having a common name in order to be referred to easily. The rules don't make things be like they are, they just explain how those effects behave, like how gravity plays a role on how a planet has a certain elliptical format around a star, or how the specific bonds between atoms define a certain molecule, and how you can't create a substance that behaves on all the same and exact principles, properties and characteristics of another one, like iron and wood, both solids but with several different characteristics and properties, that could be all replicated if you create a substance using the same molecules with the same exact arrangement. That is implied by how the universe works, and we implement our perception of that rule as we get better on observing it on action, you can't break a rule just by not believing it, you can't float at will because you don't believe in gravity, those rules are imposed on everything wether you like it or not. If something breaks a certain rule, it must obey another rule that has higher precedence over the first rule, even if not comprehensible yet, but it performs according to something that dictates its behaviour.  What you call ""regularities of experience"" are the exact same rules in which the universe works, calling them by a different name or dissecting the meaning of the world ""rule"" doesn't make them any different. No one invented gravity or magnetism or any other rule, it was there before anyone could even notice it. We just refer to it as a rule because it always follows a pattern, and reffering to it on a philosophical way serves no use to anyone.   You can't perceive an object that doesn't have a shape, and so on.   What is called ""Dark matter"", has no observable shape, but it has a force and we know it's there because of it. A force is not a shape in the same way a particle is not a wave. If you say that a force is a shape you are just being philosophical again, using the fact that most forces behave in similar observable directions which could be interpreted as shapes if representations of it are created, and philosophy doesn't explain physical phenomenons, just ponders over them.   There are lots of problems with the ""things are made from other things"" approach. In our direct experience, nothing is ""made from"" anything and there are no hierarchies.   That has to be the biggest bullshit I ever read. What you were doing during chemistry and physics lessons? Everything that is, is made of something that follows an hierarchy. You cannot have hadrons without quarks and gluons, cannot have atoms without protons, neutrons and electrons, and that goes on to the point of physical observable objects, like, try making a house by jumping the step on the hierarchy where you make the walls and columns and see how that works.  Your way of thinking philosophically leads nowhere other than more questions and zero answers and is deprecated as hell."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,38f4sc,Igneom,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"First off: I think you've misunderstood half of what I said. But let's continue anyway...   On Rules   Well, you wrote a lot there to counter... nothing. I was pointing out that rules are our descriptions, our measures. As they presuppose certain concepts, and those concepts have shifted over time, they are not ""how the universe works"". To think so is to be ignorant of what science is; it's the ""popular science view"".   No one invented gravity or magnetism or any other rule, it was there before anyone could even notice it.   Really? In what way? This isn't really a controversial point. ""Gravity"" has changed several times during the course of our scientific history. The ""rules"" have changed.  This doesn't devalue them in any way; but it's important that we recognise what we are actually doing: creating useful descriptions, not discovering truth.   you can't break a rule just by not believing it, you can't float at will because you don't believe in gravity...   I don't really understand why you say this? I've never suggested such a thing. We don't fall to earth because of belief. Nor do we fall to earth because of ""gravity"". ""Gravity"" is the name we give to a certain description of ""falling"".  There is nothing ""behind"" the observations of regularities though. Rather, the observations are ""behind"" the rules we create. That's not really very controversial surely. Physics was based up on this approach - that one could create descriptions of things without treating them as ""real entities"" behind the scenes.   What is called ""Dark matter"", has no observable shape, but it has a force and we know it's there because of it.    Dark matter is a concept to attempt to fill a gaping hole in a theory, and it's a bit of a hack-job frankly.  But that's not what I was talking about: I was referring to the fact that we cannot perceive something we cannot conceive of. Since our conceptualisation is based on ""shadow sensory"" experience, all of our descriptions do in some sense have ""shapes"", but not literally.   It's just a way of saying that we are always dealing with the formatting of our minds foremost, as we explore the ""universe"".   philosophy doesn't explain physical phenomenons, just ponders over them.   Philosophy provides interpretations. To be honest, physics is tightly bound with philosophy. It just chooses to focus on relationships rather than meanings. However, the philosophy is there. As ""physicist-mathematician-cosmologist"" George Ellis has said:   Krauss, Stephen Hawking and Neil deGrasse Tyson have been bashing philosophy as a waste of time. Do you agree?  If they really believe this they should stop indulging in low-grade philosophy in their own writings. You cannot do physics or cosmology without an assumed philosophical basis. You can choose not to think about that basis: it will still be there as an unexamined foundation of what you do. The fact you are unwilling to examine the philosophical foundations of what you do does not mean those foundations are not there; it just means they are unexamined.  -- George Ellis, Scientific American interview   To continue...   [On things being made from other things]  That has to be the biggest bullshit I ever read. What you were doing during chemistry and physics lessons?    I was in class preparing for my physics degree, I suppose...  Is an atom made from sub-atomic particles, or are sub-atomic particles what an atom actually is? Or better, are they all part of the description or model we call ""an atom""?  This partitioning of concepts involved in hierarchies and groupings is pretty important. The key to solving many theoretical problems is often repartitioning.  It's important that we  remember that ""atom"" (say) is the name given to a collection of disparate observations, connected by a description - but the universe itself is not ""atomic"".   Your way of thinking philosophically leads nowhere other than more questions and zero answers and is deprecated as hell.   There are no answers, just different ways of looking at things. The purpose of science is to create ""useful descriptions"" which connect observations and allow predictions to be made.  There is always an implied philosophical foundation to a particular physical description. To ignore this ""metaphysics"" is to save up trouble for later. Concepts which may have been useful fictions in the past outlive their usefulness. If we foolishly confuse them with ""the truth"" then we will be reluctant to let them go.   Perhaps worse, we may start to accept descriptions as being accurate simply because they are pleasingly self-consistent, despite having minimal links to observation and prediction - e.g. superstrings and friends.

It usually makes a bunch of assumptions and excludes others.  Like  we are being simulated by a race just like us, living in a universe just like ours.  Give Moore's law a few more decades and we can do the same..  I think it's more likely that we could be simulated on something that isn't much like our digital computers (but that's all we know)   It might be more like VR than a simulation.  And our simulated universe could be different from the master universe in many ways.  For instance- the famous observer/waveform collapse property of quantum mechanics reminds many people of how in a computer game, scenes aren't rendered unless someone is observing.  However the properties of QM are quite different from pixels & polygons in a game.  So if that is evidence of a simulation, it's nothing like our computers even with Moore's law run amuck .

Your friend took a very save bet by just guessing if you break up or not. There is just a 50:50 chance. Also his guesses have been very general (you could also intepret the ""rift"" part as someone of you dies).  If he had guessed, that you are going to marry each other and have five kids, two of them twins, well, then i would be impressed. If that really happened, of course.  He basically ""divined"" you something that can't be wrong. It is like saying ""it will rain!"" and shortly after ""the sun will shine!""."

What you're talking about (the kind of stuff that would involve ""guessing a general fact about a person's life"") is called psychic reading, not divination; divination involves making some kind of random choice (rolling dice, pulling a card from a deck) and then interpreting the answer. In the case of this method, you generate a seemingly-random number (with the belief that the universe will influence the outcome of the number) and then correspond that number with a book.  I'd suggest doing some reading on the I Ching if you want to continue this discussion, because it's hard to have a conversation when one party doesn't know what the other party is talking about. You can call it bunk if you like, that's fine, but it doesn't work remotely like you say it does."

How the heck do you know that she is right? Because she told you so? Thats all it needs to persuade you?  She gave you a diviniation that can't be wrong because there is a 50:50 chance and she told you both sides. It is simple math and some rational thinking. You do not know how she did it, so she could have told you anything."

""Ghost, we're running late. We need those keys. Please return them. We'll give you anything you want!""   So we start naming stuff. ""Money?"" ""Candy?"" ""Some ice cream?""

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3844b4,drocks27,6,Tue Jun 2 02:15:21 2015 UTC,"I had a weird experience happen at my new job. So the first day that I started at my new job, my coworkers nonchalantly mentioned that the building we are in is haunted.  I laughed but they told me of the many experiences they had had.    My direct supervisor was locked in the bathroom one time.  The bathroom locks from the inside with a dead bolt.  She couldn’t open the door and looked at the dead bolt and it was not locked.  She was in the building by herself, so her only thought was that someone was holding the door shut.  She yelled who is there, and the door opened and there was no one else in the building.   She has brought her dog in to the office with her when she had to come in on a Sunday.  The dog was happy and fine when she was in her office but when she went to go into to one of the classrooms the dog started to freak out, and wouldn’t go in that room with her and tried to get her to come out of that room.   In this same room, one of my coworkers had brought her daughter with her and her daughter (3 year old) also didn’t like that room and told her mom, that there was a monster in the closet.  This coworker also had labels for a filing cabinet come flying off when she was in the file closet and it is really hard to push the labels out of the label holders.    The director of the agency also brought her daughter in, and one time they couldn’t find her.  She was in the classroom (where the other little girl said the monster was) and she was holding a pen and looked like she was trying to give it to someone.  She let go of it and then looked really confused when it dropped as if she was expecting someone to take it.   Now I love the show Ghosthunters, and I believe that we are all energy and it is possible to leave energy behind, but I don’t know if I believe in ghosts persay.  I love the debunking they do in Ghosthunters and there was old wiring in this building so I think that can account for some of the uneasy feelings that people have had in the building.    However I had a weird experience of my own.   I had just gotten my ID card encoded to open the front door of our building on a Friday. I was excited to be able to use it when I got to work on Monday so I didn’t have to wait on my coworkers to open the door for me. I had the ID in my wallet placed in a position where it would be easily scannable, but I don’t have to take it out of my wallet to do so.  I walked up to the scanner, took out my wallet and placed it on the scanner.  Nothing happened.   I looked at my wallet and opened it up.  My card was not where it was supposed to be.  I searched my whole wallet, and it was not in there.  I pressed the buzzer and was let in by my supervisor.  I told her my card was not in my wallet and I don’t know why I had taken it out.   I called my wife who hadn’t left the house yet to see if it was anywhere. She looked for a few minutes and couldn’t find it but then had to leave for work.  A little later I remembered that the spot I had been keeping it in, I had put raffle tickets in that spot that weekend when we went to a client appreciation party put on by our real estate agent.  I texted him asking if he had found my ID card, and he said he had not.  I was resigned to looking for it when I got home after that, and then facing the possibility that I would have to get it replaced already and pay $20 to do so.  Then a new client of mine came in and after he left, he came back to the door and knocked on it.  He said that he had found an ID card outside.  Both my coworkers had been outside numerous times that day and did not see it.  I don’t know how it came out of my wallet, which I kept closed when I first attempted to use it.  My coworkers were all like “It was the ghost!”  It must have fallen out when I first pulled my wallet out but it doesn’t really seem possible for that to have happened as my wallet was closed and in the upright position. Maybe if I held my wallet upside down and shook it, it would have fallen out."

I haven't noticed it happening with nail polish (which I have a lot of), but it's happened a time or two with DVDs (which I... also have a lot of). The most recent time I can think of was last summer - my mom wanted to know if I knew where a certain movie was, and I was pretty sure I'd seen it in a stack of four of five others over by the TV. I went and looked, and it was there, and I told her so - but when she went over to look herself, it was gone. It was a pretty distinctive box too, with the title along the spine in big letters, so I don't think it's likely I had just mixed it up with something else."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,386boe,TriumphantGeorge,4,Tue Jun 2 05:18:43 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna say... synchronicity. Actual synchronicity, which is different to ""coincidence"". It seems pretty much baked into the universe somehow.   People spend their lives looking for messages from outside entities (God) or for deeper secrets in the world, but I think that's a mistake. It's more accurate to say you are seeing your own mind in action. The truth is, we tend to have experiences that are consistent with the direction we're taking.  You might find Kirby Surprise's book, Synchronicity, worth a read. There's a great interview with him here too. (He's a clinical psychologist who got interested in this stuff, due to his own experiences and those of his patients.)  Short version:    If you believe something, you are implying its existence to your mind, and you will often encounter experiences consistent with your belief as a result.  So don't ""believe"" your experiences or your own thinking as being ""externally true"". They have no inherent meaning except what you attach to them. Just treat them as... more experiences.   Oh and don't worry about ""God's purpose"", just contemplate your own purpose, which is to say: pay attention to how you feel about things, what you are drawn to, and stay ""authentic"" by being true to that. Only you can know you."

Right, if you think about it in terms of ""all the things that had to happen"". But it doesn't work that way.   It sounds strange to say, but all that had to happen is three observations: your question, a voice in your head, and a lamp switching, all of which take place in the same ""place"" (your ""perceptual space""). The story about ""what must have happened for that"" is something you imagine afterwards, a bit like in this recent QM experiment (see comments).

I was sat waiting around in my house before I was about to head to the doctors. I had a thought about a guy I had not seen in 8 years. I repeated his nickname a few times ""chunky"" and remembered how his mum had told his friends not to call it him anymore (we were in school when I last saw him) I have barely thought of him since school. As im sitting in the waiting area he walks right through the door and up to the receptionist. I sat there confused, I didnt even talk to him I just sat there shaking my head. It reminded me of the other coincidences I had experienced. Here is what I can remember.............. A friend received a phone call while we were out together. I had a thought, ""her baby has died"" and after a few minutes of being silent he told us his sister had a miscarriage. ....... My bosses wife turned up on the building site one day, I saw her get out of the car with another man ""Those two are fucking each other"" was my thought, I found out that night I was right. This is probably reading body language........ My ears would ring before someone called me or would enter a room I was in...... my only dreams about sex were a day or two before I met a woman I would have sex with......... There are so many of these little coincidences, many of them I have forgot. I would push them to the back of my mind.  These are not grand experiences, but I thought you might find them interesting.

I can say confidently it wont drive me crazy, its a gateway to learning and I intend to understand it. Thats why I posted it here, I'm willing to hear replies and wondered if anyone else had the same sort of experience.  On the mindset aspect, I completely agree with you saying I was in the right frame of mind, I knew as soon as it happened I would probably never be so open to the possibilities of contact with a higher power again, I might never be this focused, full of positivity and belief. I didnt speak about it for a while.

Love, the mind state of caring and understanding feels a lot like how I felt when praying and if going through the bible taught me anything its that most of what I heard of it was wrong.

Your experience was positive and I think that it would be very interesting to see what would happen.  If nothing else to get a better feel of him having your back.    Years ago I was in a 'is God real' phase and like you I asked for a sign.  It was late at night and I was sort of meditating and fell asleep.  So I had this dream where me and Jesus were just hanging out.  Unfortunately when I woke up I did not remember a single word of what was said except that the gist of it was that we had known each other for a very long time.  And that we were old friends and that it was all good.  At the time I was actually trying to disprove God and Jesus and the bible but that dream has given me a sort of respect because even though I'm not religious it was a very positive and weird dream that felt very real.    I watched that Isaac Newton documentary.  He was a ridiculously smart person.  What ever happened to his research on the bible?  If anybody would have found something I'm sure he would of.

I'm no more entitled to answers than anyone else I think my prayer was as innocent and sincere as it could be, I was much less cynical, less hardened by the world back then and unless ridding myself of cynicism would give me that mind state, I might not be as sincere again. I wont pray for more I dont think. It would be for the wrong reasons. I had related experiences but not as powerful. I have a lot of problems with the bible too, the sermon on the mount and the examples of jesus stopping the cruelty of the law (law of moses I think) cleared things up a little but I have hundreds of unanswered questions and only studying it in more depth will give me more of an insight. Wow, the all is good thing remains something powerful about that experience I remember too, it almost felt like I have nothing on this planet to worry about.

You might just be giving yourself the answer you want to hear, the experience you're seeking. If you had said, ""Oh Faerie King, show me a sign!"" and had the voice and the light had gone out, would you have treated that as proof of the Faerie King?  Given the choice: that you did it or that God did it, which would be the better answer? (Alternative: everyone has a ""God aspect"" to them.)  Because paranoid and delusional people have exactly the same experience: They ask for signs that they are chosen and special, or evidence that they are being followed by evil organisations... and they get it. People do look over at them. Cameras do turn in their direction. Their phone do gets crackly. Their mail does arrive rumpled.  But it's not because they are actually chosen/followed. Just: unfortunate synchronicity + the meaning they ascribe to it.  So you're right to see this as a ""gateway for investigation"" rather than being necessarily because of something in particular (a 'higher power' or whatever)."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,386boe,RequiredPsycho,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:19:45 2015 UTC,"elaborate on synchronicity for me, were you believe it originates and do you you believe it has anything to do with say parallel universes? I'm quite interested in physics. I had watched some of the interview you linked me and gathered what he was getting at was related to parallel universes and a different me communicating with me?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,386boe,RequiredPsycho,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:28:05 2015 UTC,"Hi, that's probably a bit confusing, so here's a simplified version.  Kirby's Description  At any moment, given what you know so far, there are a limited set of possibilities of what might happen next. Whatever our minds have been focused on, that's how we select between the probable next-moments. We seem to bend the probabilities to experience what we are focused on - we are drawn to actions which lead to them, thoughts appear which match them.  When he talks of parallel universes, he really means different possible next-moments that you are choosing between. There is no ""different you"" and nobody is communicating with anyone. Simply by focusing on something, you are selecting experiences which match up.  4D Patterns  So, in the case of your example, you were focused on getting a sign. (Your mind was on that even before you asked: your asking was one of the events that came from it being on your mind.) You were then drawn by a spontaneous thought to look at the light just at the moment it was going to go off. The ""asking"", the ""thought"", the ""looking"" and the ""light switching"" are events which belong to a single pattern, arising from you focusing on this.  Groups of experiences arise together as a result: In your case of anticipating stuff, the thought ""this guy"" and observation ""this guy passing me"" are part of the same pattern too. It's like the world is a 4D pattern then you see in 3D slices. It seems like this causes that, but they are part of the same thing - synchronistic patterns.  But maybe put that aside for now...  Simplified Synchronicity  Unfortunately the first link in my other comment was wrong - I've fixed it now. Here's the correct link to the comment where I say a bit about synchronicity vs messages. Check it out, and maybe the 'Imagination Room' metaphor in the comment further down.  I also suggest an experiment, you should try it. Sit down quietly and imagine, as if it was actually happening in front of you, an owl. Really imagine it vividly there in front of you for about 5 minutes, with the intention that your life is going to be filled with owls for the next while.  Then see what happens."

I, also, had an experience that I heard a voice that I recognized as very familiar and there was no one in the room but me. Back then, I honestly thought it was god. I was not religious at the time by any means, but to me, there was no explanation for it. Now, many years later, I do not think it was ""god"", but a voice much more familiar, my own. I heard this voice coming from directly behind my right ear. I've discarded that idea of it being anything but my imagination for the past several years until now that I've been seriously exploring the possibility that reality is simply not what it seems. Thank you for sharing your story with us. I'm curious as to if you have looked back on your life and have had other things happen that could have also been some kind of glitch? Like me, I had simplified my experience to something that would have been an acceptable although radical religious experience. What I believe now is possibly far more stranger. So I'm wondering if you too have reflected on other things that you couldn't easily explain."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3819qt,CleverGirl2014,8,Mon Jun 1 04:13:40 2015 UTC,"[i wrote a long reply and i dont think it ended up getting posted.]  This is very similar to my experience. The voice that I knew to be my own sounded like it was whispered into my right ear. ""Shit."" but softly, like I was trying not to wake someone. Sometimes when I am doing the same thing, crouched down to get something out of the oven, I think of this, and I consciously say it, in the same way I heard it. Then I start to wonder if I made some kind of weird time warp.   The whole thing happened about 4-5 years ago. It was only recently I started to believe that the universe as we know it is some kind of simulation. I was actually looking up simulation theories when I discovered this forum. This phantom voice/light is the only glitch I can think of in recent memory, though I do experience deja vu often.  I don't necessarily believe that this ""matrix"" we live in is a tool of some malevolent force to imprison us. I think that the part of us that exists outside this universe chooses to participate in this universe as sort of a game/challenge. Maybe it's just thrilling to be able to feel emotions or physical sensations that dont exist outside this universe. Maybe we test ourselves to see if we get bogged down here on earth by well....earthly matters and forget who we really are.  Maybe this is the wrong place for these thought. If so, please direct me to where I can discuss this with people. Anyone I talk to just thinks I'm a crackhead for proposing these ideas."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,3819qt,verumnemo,2,Tue Jun 2 06:39:16 2015 UTC,"The ideas came first. Subsequent reflecting on my life brought me back to the weird kitchen experience. I just asked said ex-girlfriend if she remembers this because the weirdest part to me was that we both experienced something unexplainable. She said she doesn't remember this time in particular, but that she experiences flashes of light to this very day. Apparently she once saw lightning come out of her feet too? This was news to me.  I'm constantly ""soul searching"" and trying to make sense of the universe. I remember seeing The Matrix as a kid, maybe 11 or 12, and thinking, ""Whooooa what if that were true? Weird"" I never seriously considered it until I learned(and I mean in the most basic sense) about multiverses, chemistry, history, reincarnation, and religion that the simulation theory just seemed the most likely to me. We reside in a universe full of natural laws that someone or something prescribed. The weirdest part is, it doesn't change anything for me. I don't feel any different about my life or the world at large. I'm not  looking to break free. It's comforting. The only thing that changes is that I want to enjoy my time here, experience the good, and be more mindful of the signs: the miracles, glitches, weird happenings."

Or I'll think I said dogs, when I really said cats (for example), and I'll believe with all of my heart that I said dogs, and my girlfriend will tell me that I didn't.  This happened a lot, and then one time we had recorded a video or something for fun, and I went back and heard what I really said.  I guess this is different, but I guess I thought of it, because I just assumed in my situation that it was my brain criss cross signals, lost somewhere, or my brain didnt process correctly what I wanted my mouth to say.  Actually now this reminds me, and i'm sure this is pretty common...... Waking up in the morning, still slightly in sleep, my girlfriend talking to me, I'm responding to her, or telling her something, and saying words that I think make sense at the time.  She's laughing at me as I awake more and more .... the words that I'm trying to say don't make sense to her, but I swear they make perfect sense as I'm trying to say them.    I guess typically this is thought of as being in a dream and transferring it to reality (when you wake up), but lately I've noticed that it's not just about the dream...sometimes I dream, sometimes I don't, but I swear it's like someone else is talking, cause I hear everything she's saying, and I'm conscious....and I'm trying to get the right words out, but their just not coming out...it's like as if i can't hear myself at first, so I don't know I'm saying the wrong thing.  I know this is kinda all over the place, but I've never really described it before besides when she and I talked and laughed about it lol.

A number of familiar, important household objects have disappeared and reappeared with a clear and present eerie factor.  For years I had a hand-turned wooden pen body given to me by my wife back when we were dating. I used it to sign everything important: marriage license, home purchase, etc. It was always around, until one day it wasn't. It simply disappeared. Like you, we took the house apart looking for it. Then, one morning months later I got up and stepped into my closet to put on my daily-use bathrobe, and the wood pen dropped out of a sleeve and onto the floor. The robe, by the way, had no pockets.  On another occasion my wife's special reindeer-head Christmas broach went missing during a holiday party at the house. No great monetary value, just small and twinkly and fun and we looked forward to having it around each holiday. Again, we took the house to pieces looking for it without success. Fast forward six to eight weeks into the new year. We were out running errands, I opened the trunk of the car to stash something, and there in the exact middle of the trunk floor grinning up at me, perfectly aligned, was the Christmas reindeer broach. No earthly explanation.  These things happen."

I went into that pouch to wear the other jewelery many times, without a sign of the earrings. I figured that they were lost, and prayed that my family members didn't find out!  Two months ago I get an idea to look for the earrings out of the blue.  There they were, in the spot I had left them two years ago.

In almost every instance I chalked it up to brain glitches. However there was one time I cannot explain. Throughout my late teens and early 20s I had a very special person in my life. To this day, it would still be more accurate to refer to him as my one true love were I prone to use those terms.   Our relationship was not typical in that he would come and go for months at a time, then just suddenly show up again. (As in he would leave the state & travel the country.) I always dreamed of him a few days before his next appearance. Then one time after he left, I did too and we didn't see each other for three years. Though in truth, in all my travels, I never stopped looking for him. I was convinced someday I'd be driving down some highway and see him hitchhiking along the way.  I had been back in our home town for awhile and was going about my then rather boring life when one particularly difficult morning I'm driving down a highway that goes through town, and there he was, just walking down the sidewalk.  So we reunited, spent almost a month together and being a bit older, settled some things about our feelings for one another. He had to go back to the state he'd been living in but this time we parted with both closure and plans to see one another again. Two weeks later, he died.   The last day we spent together he had done this silly thing of trading an earring with me. It wasn't sentimental at the time, he just wanted what I happened to be wearing. I put his earring in a box I had of things we'd collected together over the years. Upon learning of his death I went to get it and it just wasn't there. I lived alone in a one bedroom house with hardwood floors, though the bedroom was carpeted. I searched for that stupid earring for what seemed like months. It was probably six to eight weeks really. I had friends help look, I took the tiny vacuum cleaner completely apart, moved furniture- the whole works.  One day I was just sitting on my couch feeling just utterly lost at the idea he would never again just show up at my door. I shook myself out of my pity party and went to the bedroom to get dressed and there on the floor, in plain sight right next to the bed we had last lied in, was the earring.  I cried/laughed a bit then swore at him as I'm still prone to do.   It's been almost 20 years now. I still have the box and the earring has stayed put, at least as far as I know."

I went back to her bedroom and it was gone.  Poof.  I searched everywhere in that drawer.  I searched again when my mom and I packed up her clothes to donate them.  No one in my family saw anyone go upstairs, and even if they had they wouldn't have enough time to randomly search through her clothing for hidden things.  More than a decade has passed and it's still gone.  My mom still gets upset when she talks about how the only thing she wanted to remember her mother by was that necklace, and it's gone.

Is it more reasonable that somebody had found it or put it there or that a mysterious force put it there and also used their mysterious force powers to wake the lady up and walk her over to the jewelry box and make her open it.  Like I already said, I like this sub and I come here for the stories.  I just think it's pretty reasonable for people to keep an open mind, especially here.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  Hell, I could be the one wrong here.  It's just simply a lot more likely that a person found it and placed it there.  Why did the mom wake up and look for it in the middle of the night?  Who knows.  Maybe she was jostled awake by someone sneaking her necklace into her jewelry box.  But the simple fact that she awoke in the night and found the necklace certainly does not prove that there are supernatural forces, or otherwise, at work."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37ylzn,Scroon,6,Thu Jun 11 22:15:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a nice experiment, thanks for posting! Some thoughts:  I'd suggest the particle-or-wave isn't a wave or a particle prior to conducting an observation - rather, ""particles"" and ""waves"" are observations.  Here's a nice snappy article from Nature magazine which offers a nice view on this:    The only reality is mind and observations, but observations are not of things. To see the Universe as it really is, we must abandon our tendency to conceptualize observations as things.  -- The Mental Universe, Richard Conn Henry, Nature, 7th July 2005   To continue:  Talking about things ""being this"" and ""being that"" independent of them being observed is an error. Extending this, it does not make sense to talk about ""something happening"" when it is not being observed. This is because the facts-of-the-world do not exist in the same form as we experience them within the senses.  Our habit of using our minds to ""imagine how things are"" and ""imagine what happened"" is just that - imagination. It amounts to making up little ""sensory stories"" about the world as if they were playing out.  Philosophers like Immanuel Kant had the notion that time and space were, effectively, ""basic sensory formatting"" of the mind just like shapes, tones, and so on. The world itself, world-as-it-is, is not spatially or temporally organised. It is an ""infinite gloop"" of dimensionless facts - not even! - which doesn't correspond to our conceptualisation, because conceptualisation itself is formatting.[1]  This means that you live in a mode of constant experiencing which is only organised ""as if"" there is time and space. Cause and effect don't mean anything:   The only rule is that the apparent world remains self-consistent as an entire pattern. This means that all observations will be coherent, without regard to apparent distances in time and space. Time and space are part of observing, not inherent divisions of the world.   More broadly:   Things that you aren't observing don't ""happen"" in a way that corresponds to sensory experiencing. Observations are the only things that ""happen"".   Potential relevance to glitches:   If a change is made to the (implied) world-pattern, the whole pattern will shift to ensure self-consistency. There will be no trace of the previous state of the world-pattern after the shift. This may not include the observer's memory, which will contain memories of experiences of the former state. The observer's memory may therefore fall out of step with the world-pattern. Glitches involving a world-pattern shift will leave no physical evidence other than the memory of it.   Final thoughts:   Therefore in a way what we are truly experiencing is the ""formatting"" of our own minds. We might view this ""formatting"" as the memories of previous observations + their implications. Experiences leave traces which in-form subsequent experiences...   [1] There's an easy-reading article on Kant here, although it gets it slightly wrong in later parts in my opinion.    EDIT1: Made some changes for increased... coherence and self-consistency. Added some glitch-based musings. EDIT2: Added some concluding remarks which, interestingly, connect to a previous comment about synchronicity."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37ylzn,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sun May 31 15:23:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks, U-Chairs, nice post.  You might also look at it from a simulation standpoint where rules dictate the outcome of a given physical setup, and these rules are running in ""realtime"". So while the helium atom is not being scattered, the particle rules are employed. But as soon as that second ""grating"" is added, wave rules are now used. Thus when the atom hits the detector, the pattern is calculated as wave interference.  Hmm, I wonder if they could turn off the second laser grating right before it hits the detector (but after the atom supposedly went through it). This would be a delayed-choice-oops-I-changed-my-mind-again experiment. [Modeled after some dates I have been on.]  Has anyone done this?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37ylzn,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sun May 31 16:12:53 2015 UTC,"This experiment actually involved either adding or taking away the second grating AFTER the atom hit the detector.

That atom didn't have any behaviour at the grating/non-grating, because we didn't observe it there at the time it passed.  It's important here to distinguish between inferred behaviour due to a model or expectation, and observed behaviour. The only behaviour observed was at the detector.

Imagining something in your mind is not the same as it happening. Imagining that ""something happened"" but is unknown, is still not the same anything happening.  It's not that we don't know what happened. It's that nothing happened. Because ""happening"" is an experience."

Even though we have this perspective of a linear flow of time, and we would expect that the particle hit the detector at a certain moment in time, that's not the case at all. Nothing happened until we observed it happening, in which case what we think of as ""the past"" seems to have been impossibly been altered by the future. In reality, if such a thing as an atom and a temporal dimension exist in any fundamental way, they're not bound by linear time."

There is obviously no such thing as a past or future. There is obviously no such thing as an object or event you have not seen. Those are just ""sensory shadows"", mere imaginings, overlaid on our actual experience...  Of course, if you didn't think, then you wouldn't be able to enjoy that realisation..."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37ylzn,kowari1,0,Sun May 31 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"At the moment that the atom passed the detector, the atom's state (whether particle or wave) was recorded without any conscious being observing it yet. Then, the scientists carried out their action (either adding or taking away the second gate) and then they observed the data recorded by the detector -- finding in every case that their action had changed what the detector detected even though the atom met the detector before they carried out their action.

The essential is right, but you are still describing an unfolding of unobserved events in time surely? The past in this account only exists in the imagination, remember. The connective story is about the past, but nothing happened in the past.   If you imagine being the scientist, looking through his eyes, moment by moment - while avoiding imagining anything else going on from a ""god's eye"" perspective - then those are the only facts-of-the-matter."

It's more accurate to say that if our expectations of linear time held true, then the detector would have recorded some state at this moment.

It's the same flame (now), but it's picking it's shape to fit the air currents (observation). And that casts the same yet different patterns of light and shadow on the walls (pasts and futures).

If it is, then funny you should mention it, because I came up with this experiment while working today. Goes something like this.  You'd establish two test groups - a control and the actual experimental group. For each group you tell them that within their group they'll play some sort of dice based game (a board game or such).  In the control group, you just let them play the game as two opposing teams and compile statistics of dice rolls and wins/losses.  For the experimental group, you ""secretly"" show one of the teams a ""magnet technology"" that loads the dice in their favor. For example, by pressing a secret button on the floor, more threes will show up in th dice. The thing is this button actually does nothing. The only difference is ththe team's expectation that it will work. So you let the group play the game, and again compile statstics on dice rolls and wins/losses.  Could there be a dice effect just based on the team's belief? Who knows? I'd like to try it, but don't have the resources (at the moment).  This is sort of like a placebo study except in this case there is no physical link between the placebo and the actual experimental mechanism. Perhaps placebos are more than mind over matter. Maybe they are mind over reality?"

There have been experiments like that before. In fact, there have been lots of pretty thorough ""psi"" type studies but they don't get any traction. Interestingly, enthusiasm seems to play a large role - beating the statistics towards the beginning and end of sessions (getting bored in the middle). Random list.  I would take this a step further though. ""Fooling ourself"" seems like a weak version of such an effect - especially belief isn't causal, but rather a filtering of what you might attempt to do. (i.e. It's intention which brings about change, and believing something simply means you are more likely to go all-out with intending it.)  Instead, it would be more interesting to see if we could ""assert new facts"" deliberately.  Perhaps mind == reality, and so all cases of cause and effect are, in effect, expectation or habit (i.e. residual intention) by someone, singly or collectively...?  (Aside: And we might ponder what ""collectively"" would actually mean. If there were contrasting intentions, would we be competing or would we simply have divergent experiences.)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37ylzn,DutytoDevelop,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:31:29 2015 UTC,"Those psi experiments are cool, but to me they always seemed too experimentally ""soft"" for the mainstream to take them seriously. Also, when testing for psi, you wouldn't be sure if you're seeing a ""telepathic effect"" or a reality altering effect. Who knows, maybe they're the same thing. I'll be checking out those studies those.   Perhaps mind == reality, and so all cases of cause and effect are, in effect, expectation or habit (i.e. residual intention) by someone, singly or collectively...?   Been thinking about this, so I'll elaborate.  1) A child's expectations of the world are a lot different from an adult's. Children don't have any preconceptions about what's possible and what isn't. So why aren't children superhuman ""intention machines""? (Like that Twilight Zone episode with the kid who can wish anything into existence.)  2) Let's just assume collective reality creation.  3) An adult's version of reality has many rules and inhibitions. Now since the adult has a more ""inhibitory"" version of reality, this possibly overrides the child's openess. It's like when two people are arguing, and one person has a very strong opinion, and the other is still learning the ropes. Of course, the strong opinion wins.  4) In this way, a version of reality becomes ""locked in"" and propagates from one generation to the next.  So, as adults, we possibly have two things inhibiting our intentions. 1) The collective inhibitions of others who ""know"" the world is supposed to work in a certain way.  2) Our own subconscious inhibitions learned from spending x-number of years on Earth.  If we want to assert new facts, it seems like these are the two inhibitors that need to be overcome.  Btw, I was thinking that maybe that's how ""magick"" works. A ritual is performed by a group of people, and the ritual provides their subconscious with a plausible mechanism through which the intention can work. It's only done to sate the subconscious objections to the implausibility of the action. The group is necessary to create a reinforced ""mini-reality"" for the ""sub-pattern"" to take hold.  Want to try it?"

Yeah. Actually, it works the other way than you might think: anything that isn't ""soft"" is very hard to get a mainstream study going in. You're right: the telepathic vs reality effect is difficult, as is the causing vs predicting thing in general.   I'm not very interested in psi research work actually, of this type. Just experimenting with generating synchronicity and so on, it is easy enough to prove to yourself that there is a flexible aspect. The official recognition that ""stuff goes on"" is nice. But there are also inherent limits maybe, due to the way experiences are formed.   If we want to assert new facts, it seems like these are the two inhibitors that need to be overcome.   I think those two things are very present. Children often are intention machines actually - environment responds to their moods; strange experiences. Some stories also indicate a problem...  And that problem is that the ""world-sharing"" model doesn't appear to be a simple one. If you have an ""extreme intention"" it may just be that you stop sharing your environment with those who would not want to experience the results. I don't mean by that that people disappear, more that you are sharing your reality experience with the versions of ""extended people"" that overlap with your own formatting.   Make a dramatic change, and you've shifted the ""world-pattern"" to what you want, but only you have a memory of the previous state.   Btw, I was thinking that maybe that's how ""magick"" works.   Yes, I think it exactly works via plausible mechanism. There is no actual mechanism, but adopting a ""second cause"" (an apparent technique or method, combined with a shared worldview for confidence) allows an ""as if"" mechanism.  More precisely, I think that magick and indeed the everyday world works by what we might call ""Active Metaphors"". That the conceptual model you have adopted = the formatting of your mind = the formatting of your experience. Change your formatting, change your experience.  Common metaphors = common, shared, everyday experience. Unusual metaphors = unusual experience. Deliberately utilising this would be the deliberate practice of magick.  I've actually played with this quite a lot. It comes as a direct offshoot of contemplating the structuring of the mind really. Synchronicity, imagination, direct intention, willing. Variations on the theme of perception.   Want to try it?   What do you have ""in mind""? :-)"

Yeah, that's how it kind of works mostly. I don't think it's restricted to that though. The takeaway from the OP experiment is: ""The only rule is that the world-pattern must remain consistent overall"".  However in this area we push into new territory: About how observations may arise, and if observations have to be permanently ""true"", and what keeps prior observations being apparently ""true"". If all that's required is that the world-pattern remains consistent, we can make potentially make any changes we like so long as the world continues to ""make sense"".  And surely ""making sense"" is a property of the mind, not of an external universe. In other words, if an observation is a sensory experience and there is no ""solid world"" behind them, perhaps the only making that observation continue to be ""true"" and have an effect on future observations, is us...   I'm just wondering how far this goes. People often talk of Steve Jobs as having had a ""reality distortion field"". Maybe he did in fact have one.   Steve Jobs exactly was into this sort of thing. If you read his biography, his history is along those sort of lines. Not ""magickal"" but more a muddle of Zen and intention. However, I also think he never really understood it, it was based more on a sort of narcissistic arrogance, self-delusion and lack of awareness. He sometimes believed rather than knew. He did after all die of thinking he could cure pancreatic cancer via a diet (a diet which he'd been on, and is linked with pancreatic troubles).

Right, but it's completely automatic, like autocomplete.  It's like we accumulate facts and those facts act as a filter or formatting for what can be experience subsequently. A new fact narrows the possible future facts.  It's a bit like exploring memories by association (as we've said before). You recall a memory pattern and then you are restricted as to what you can remember from there. The rule is that the next pattern must always ""make sense"". It must always be thinkable from where you have got to so far.  If you are in a ""moment"" where observe that a particle is in a certain state, then you can only move to ""next-moments"" which make sense, which correspond to a coherent world. For as long as there is ambiguity, though, your ""next-moments"" are less restricted. So long as you don't know, you have more flexibility.   The facts-of-the-world are being fixed in real time.   That's why it's good to focus on actual experience. What you imagine about something just doesn't count. (Unless perhaps you imagine it really, really intensely...)  Uncertainty and Unpindownability   I was thinking of the uncertainty principle the other day and how interesting it is that reality doesn't seem to want to be pinned down to a single set of physical parameters.   When two things are the same thing but divided across formatting structures - e.g. it has aspects in time and aspects in space, like position and momentum - then we have a problem.  It's like trying to see both sides of a coin at the same time. The coin is a single pattern, but because our experiencing is formatted ""spatially"" then we can't experience both sides at once.  It our experiencing had been formatted ""spectrally"" then perhaps we would be unable to see different colours at once.  We make this mistake again and again: seeing ""two things"" when it is just aspects of ""one thing"". In the limit, of course, we realise that the universe itself is just ""one thing"" and the only divisions which exist are the formatting of our minds."

We can only ever really examine the formatting of our own minds: Our thoughts about our minds, are of course within our minds and therefore subject to its formatting.   We imagine space and time to be pre-existing only because our thoughts are inherently structured as ""shadow sensory experiences"", and so pre-formatted by space and time. We cannot perceive or think our way beyond that formatting, so we incorrectly assume it is inherent to the universe. (Except for the occasional mystical experience, of course.)

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37v4g0,TunaMayo42,6,Sun May 31 01:14:45 2015 UTC,"Hiya, I'm in uni studying Psychology, trying to write my dissertation which is somewhat relevant:   Simply put, it's about how we bind information and perceive the illusion of a stable world through comparing stimulus input to predictions made from previous experiences through a hierarchical Bayesian inference system.  Now for the relevance:  The other day I was playing a video game (SMITE) and this enemy was juking every skill shot I tried to land, which I normally hit, and it was infuriating the hell out of me.  Then at one point, one of my allies jumped in 1v3 and fucked up and died. The exact moment he died I was looking at the screen and I felt like I had known this exact moment before, the enemies, where they were, what had just gone down. More importantly, I KNEW what they were going to do next.  I knew where the enemy who had juked me all game, or gone CC immune when I had gotten him, was about to go. I knew where I was going to place my skillshot, I knew where it was going to land and I knew how the next couple of seconds were going to go down.   Almost in a robotic fashion I completed these actions and it went down exactly as it had flashed before me (not literally but you get it).  Now, as a scientist by nature I can only try to explain this phenomenon through facts. As I was delving into the literature today it occurred to me, what if De Ja Vu is the brains predictive certainty of something about to occur? (due to the conclusions of my dissertation and other literature)  Ie, you're brain comprehends the external stimulus set before it, compares it to all previous similar experiences over and over again until it produces the most accurate outcome. This is essentially how you know that the rumble of an engine does in fact come from that car that drove past you.  It makes sense seeing as the more you do anything; sport, gaming, maths, instrument etc, you become more attuned to the potential outcomes of an action of your own or someone else's. You're usually able to predict other people's movements in a field where you have vast experience pretty well.  So what if De Ja Vu is the brain essentially coming to the conclusion: This event has a near 100% certainty of this outcome. It's the only possible outcome, there can be no doubt, it must be true.  It would give rise to the experience of having seen/done something before; bearing in mind that in the brain external stimuli and internal representations produce very similar brain activation."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37v4g0,TunaMayo42,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:01:19 2015 UTC,"Woudn't this be remarkable if I could make these sorts of predictions regularly and at will?  Or are you saying that we do, all the time, but the chances of it being 100% are pretty slim?  In any case, I wish I could exert more of my will over the matter, because what's happening here seems to require no effort at all, and in my case, less than no effort. I was totally just being a space case.  What's your opinion, near-expert? Is this something (with assistance or in the future) that I might be able to do at will or at least more efficiently? How near are you to the completion of your dissertation? I haven't heard this idea before, but I've heard ideas that sound like they could be friends with your idea, which probably means your dissertation is well timed."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37v4g0,Royeralta,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:11:03 2015 UTC,"It would be remarkable and potentially ground breaking if we could actually prove that this kind of thing is true. A lot of evidence and theories to suggest it, but not a lot to directly test it.  We definitely make mental predictions of events based on past experiences, that's how we guess the outcomes of things all the time, by comparing what is put in front of us to what we already know.  I would say that the chances are extremely slim due to the seemingly infinite variables involved in the whole process. It could be simply an arbitrary event in which the ""stars align"" and rather than multiple potential outcomes, one is the only possible outcome.  To answer your question, our technology is limited and our knowledge of the brain's inner workings are childlike. Hypothetically, if this was true then it would stand to reason that in a controlled environment with limited variables and training on the matter, it is possible that you could elicit the feeling of De Ja Vu more often. But you wouldn't be able to predict the future, it would be more like a ""spidey sense"" than Nicholas Cage in ""Next"".  But it would be virtually impossible to apply this to real life given the random nature of it.  I would argue that De Ja Vu as we know it and the experiences we had are different and evoked from different causes. Reports of De Ja Vu are common but reports of predicitive De Ja Vu are extremely uncommon.  De Ja Vu has been shown to be reliably reproduced through transcranial brain stimulation of parts of the limbic system (associated with memory). Though to be a disturbance of the dopaminergic system or gamma oscillations. An explanation of which could be as simple as: Something disrupts the memory encoding system and the memory of the present (5 x 10-44 seconds being the closest estimate) gets stored before the brain ""tells you"" what's going on in front of you. Therefore you have the memory of what's in front of you to before you actually ""see"" it.  Whereas our experience could be the process I posit, which could be part of the same system as regular De Ja Vu. In that regular De Ja Vu is due to something going wrong at the lower end of the hierarchy, the encoding of the stimulus is processed before the perception. Whereas our experiences could involve that as well as a predictive certainty.  I have all the points I am going to make written down in my diss, I'm just looking to gain more data (I'm testing the plasticity of the binding system, which can be improved with training) as well as discuss this concept with my supervisor. It's a relatively novel approach so I'm excited at the possibilities.   I have read a few papers along similar veins, namely Picard and Friston (2014) on the hierarchical system and White (2015) on the pre-reflective experiences of ""I"". I'd like to know if you have any more!  Then again, this could all be wrong and the potential string theory explanation could be true: It's an experience we have already had in an alternate universe.  TL;DR - Theoretically, you could be able to reproduce such events with the right technology and a deeper understanding of how the brain really works in a controlled environment. If you could apply that to real life is up in the air for the future, but right now I'd say no."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37v4g0,TunaMayo42,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:35:57 2015 UTC,"On a slight tangent:  Our perception of a stable/continuous world and present is an illusion created by the brain to compensate for our biological flaws. Wrote a paper explaining the mechanisms behind that as well.  Relevance being that delusions and illusions are due to a fault in this ""illusion system"".   Delusions such as seeing or hearing things even though they are sounds and sights created in the brain (potentially due to memory maintenance or simply a flaw); there is a fault in the inference process and the brain is unable to simply say ""this noise is coming from me"", like our inner monologue. Therefore the top-down process and higher hierarchical structures (frontal cortices) think it can't come from us but it must come from somewhere, therefore externalise the sensation and rationalise it with previous experience and predictions: ""That sound must be coming from somewhere, it's a knocking sound, someone must be knocking on the door"".  Illusions such as motion induced blindness occur due to sensory deprivation. So part of an image or sound is incomplete, either due to the source or your sensory system, and again the top-down processes ""fill in the gaps"" to provide a logical explanation.   Slightly off topic, but has it's links. Conclude what you will from this :)"

Learn to forgive (yourself) and focus on making positive contributions, don't get stuck in hate, cynicism and regret for how things could be different. If you focus on the negative, you will also attract more negativity towards you and it can become a vicious cycle. Focus on the positive and attract positive energy towards you and you may end up creating a universe for yourself eventually that's almost like a 'utopia'.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37rjbd,theendishigh,7,Sat May 30 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on things...  First, try out the idea that each and every one of us is much, much more than we seem. Each physical person is probably just the tip of the iceberg as far as who we really are goes.  This is sort of like talking about the ""soul"", however, the soul always sounds so much like something separate, something that's only a fraction of our living selves. I'll suggest that it's the other way around. The living self is only small fraction, a shadow, of what we really are.  This isn't to say our physical lives are unimportant. They're very important, and beautiful in their messed up ways. Maybe we're here on a holiday. Or maybe it's a learning experience. Or maybe we just do it because it's cool.  Getting back to multiple realities, I'm starting to think that every ""physical person"" in this world is like a story. And behind those persons/stories are readers (who we really are). Sometimes we read these stories together, and sometime paths diverge, and one reader's story comes to and end while ours goes on.  So whoever was reading your mom's story with you is probably (definitely?) still out there either continuing their own little adventure or possibly waiting somewhere for you to finish yours.  All in all, what I'm trying to say is that while your mom's story may have had its ups and downs, the reader behind it was always OK and is still OK now. And in the end, when the pages are read and everything is said and done, we'll all still meet again."

What you ""are"" is a consciousness that has a series of experiences - you might call that your ""trajectory"". If you have a car crash and then suddenly find you have reset, it's not that time went backwards for you. Your experience still consisted of this-moment then this-moment then this-moment...  In this approach, ""brains"" are inside experiences. There is correlation between the experience  and the brain-in-the-experience, but it does not ""cause"" anything.

Is it inside the dream experience? Is it producing the dream experience? You don't directly experience having a brain anyway, so in what sense does the brain-as-conceived produce anything?

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37si5r,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sat May 30 01:59:10 2015 UTC,"That's the first time I've ever heard of quantum immortality involving jumping backward in time.  If quantum immortality is a thing, and you get hit by a car, I'm thinking you'd jump over to the next closest parallel universe in which you didn't get hit by the car.   So what would you experience? I'm thinking you'd feel like you had a vision of getting hit by a car, or an eerie feeling like you had been hit by a car, rather than having an actual memory of it.  How does this info get encoded into your gray matter? No idea. But that's because there's a great deal that science doesn't yet understand about the relationship between the brain and the mind.  Consider what this psychologist has to say about the question of whether or not people are capable of experiencing shared dreams:   The majority position in science is that consciousness is epiphenomena of brain processes, but there is sufficient evidence from various sources arguing that consciousness is not just epiphenomena, which is not to say that brain matter does not affect it, of course it does, but rather these ideas of nonlocal consciousness form around quantum mechanics in physics, digital physics, research into presentiment, group effects of meditation practice, effects of prayer etc. Within this framework the idea of two people dreaming together is acceptable. - Jayne Gackenbach PhD — Department of Psychology, MacEwan University    Lots of people definitely believe that consciousness is epiphenomena that emerges from the physical matter. But that's not something that's been proven. It could be that consciousness exists outside of the physical matter and gets recorded into it. Your brain could be more like an interface between your consciousness and your body rather than being the thing that produces your consciousness."

So this would definitely count as a Mandela Effect, although, I suppose, a localized one.  Are you sure this is a shittier version of the universe than the last one? In my life, I've come to the conclusion that in every disadvantage, there is actually a greater advantage, even if you don't know it.  For example, for many years I haven't had very much money at all. It's been very challenging, and at times really sucks. However, even though I wouldn't have chosen this explicitly, the experience has taught me how hollow materialism and consumerism can be. I feel like it's given me a more authentic perspective on this life experience, so that I appreciate the things ""that matter"".  I have other examples but won't get into them here.  Maybe there's something you can learn from Cheryl or something Cheryl can learn from you? Maybe she's dealing with some issues of her own, and she acts the way she does because she doesn't know any other way to deal with things.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37nq0x,PointyOintment,5,Tue Jun 2 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"Hi DifferentLouie.  I would suggest you read a bit (or a lot) on the subject of Out of Body Experiences (OBEs, also known as Astral Projection) and possibly near death experiences as well.  It sounds to me that you had one or the other.  OBEs are especially interesting as there are those that claim that they have experienced either past or future lives, as well as parallel lives/versions of themselves.   There are many great books and online references out there on the subject - talking about what they are, as well as how to incubate them.    A good starting point is 3 books by Robert Monroe (book 1 called Journeys Out of Body).  He is very metaphysical in his explanations and theories regarding OBEs.  Particularly of interest to you, he has vivid accounts of his experiences in other realities (I think in books 2 & 3; however, read all three books in order).  His conclusion in the end, if I recall, is that each one of us is made up of many different versions of ""you"".  The sum total of these ""yous"" is an oversoul that exists - overarching all of ""you"".  The oversoul is you here now as well as every other version of you existing all at once and in a higher plane.  The oversoul may also be accessible via an OBE if you are ""ready"" or skilled enough.  I think it all depends on the person, really.  Anyway, bit of a tangent there, but it's very fascinating and interesting to say the least.    Typically with an OBE, you exit your body during your sleep cycle and are pulled back or returned to your body when it's over (most often they end either through loss of focus or something disturbing your physical body). It's all very natural and organic.  If you enter far enough or if death triggered the OBE (near death experience), it is possible that you lost your anchor to your reality / body.  Hence your experience...  Since the events that you have described have left a huge impact on you, I think you would benefit greatly to seek knowledge on these subjects.  And who knows, you may find exploring alternate realities via OBE enjoyable and fulfilling.  I personally experience OBEs; I seek them out and incubate them as often as I can.  I love the subject.  Having your first OBE is an incredible eye-opening experience that potentially can shift your entire view as to what reality is as well as what is possible.   I'm more than happy to answer any questions or offer further advice.  /ramble"

Robert Monroe's book's are fascinating. It's also worth checking out Oliver Fox's Astral Projection: A Record of Research which describes his experiments in the early 1900's. There's something refreshing about reading accounts which pre-date any modern theorising.  I'll add a reference to Don Degracia's OBE guide since it's free and the hypnogogia method is pretty well described.

If the idea of the whole quantum suicide thing is that your consciousness can't escape this life, wouldn't taking over the life of another you in a nearby alternate reality be ending the consciousness of that alternate you?  You seem to have no memories of what that alternate you would have known as reality prior to you taking over that body.  (i.e. you didn't know that this world's Cheryl still works there).  Didn't you effectively kill that alternate you when you took over his life?"

You said it was a small old cemetery, and that made me think of my dad's relatives.  My dad's relatives are buried in an small, old, rural cemetery, and their headstone is a very beautiful granite one from the late 1880's.  There was a bad storm that knocked down a huge tree branch and it broke the headstone off at the base.  My dad stopped by and propped up the headstone against the ""stump"" of it's base.  He went by a few weeks later and the stone was gone!  Dad was pissed.  So after inquiring who was in charge of the cemetery (the county) he contacted their offices and he was told that they had removed the stone.  They were cleaning it up and were going to but it back once they figured out how to get the big stone ""glued"" back on.  Maybe the headstone you saw was knocked down and then replaced by the county.  Just a thought.  As for the park sign?  No clue... maybe it broke too?  But if not... freaky."

I found an apartment and we moved out two weeks later and we both slept in my big bed with the lights on until we moved.    I never told my son why we did that (can't remember what my excuse was for moving so quickly and both of us sleeping in my bed with the light on) until many years later.

Often they happen when I am anticipating something happening the next day, so when it gets to that day it feels like I've already lived it. Kinda like déjà vu I guess"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37oqhk,yoshi46,2,Fri May 29 12:01:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Something that happened in my dream the previous night, even of I vaguely remember it, can affect my perception the entire day."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37oqhk,BlahBlahBlasphemee,1 point,Fri May 29 12:07:22 2015 UTC,"Theres a possibility that what you're experiencing is a form of lucid dreaming (being awake in a dream), but you just aren't fully aware when it's happening.  The more it happens, the easier it is to distinguish reality from a dream.  In one night I'll ""wake up"" 3 or 4 times completely convinced that I'm awake and ready to start the day, until I get out of bed.  There are a few things that I can't do in a dream (tell time, read the same thing twice, scream, etc), most people refer to these as ""reality checks.""  A lot of checks are common amongst people but it's interrsting to research and see the unique things someone can come up with, which is what I suggest you do.  Once you are capable of realizing you're in a dream, you can control what you do and have the wildest dreams ever instead of another regular day!  Its such a complex subject, if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them for you.  Having this ability can be a very scary or very beautiful part of your life, depends on what you make it!"

My cell phone used to call people on it's own.  And I don't mean butt dialing.  It would be sitting on the table and dial out.  It did it the same time every night pretty much (just after midnight, IIRC).  And it wouldn't always call the same person.  I only found out because it called my then GF.  She came downstairs and asked what was up and why did I hang up on her.  Looked at my phone and sure enough, it had an outgoing call to her.    Never did figure out 100% was wrong with that phone.  But I did realize it was calling the last person I had called, for whatever reason.  So I just started deleting my call history every night and it stopped calling people."

I've heard a theory that deja vu is you reliving an experience that you've previously dreamed and possibly forgotten, which is why it seems so oddly familiar and yet strange at the same time. I honestly have no idea. We barely understand consciousness and cognition as it is and there will surely be some strange and surprising discoveries as we learn more. It's fun to think about"

As long as the ""consciousness exists only in the brain"" dogma remains rigid and firm, the scientific community will continue to sweep these phenomena under the rug. Its not a conspiracy, its just plain dogma.  Consciousness is not a ""thing."" It is not matter. It does not abide by the same rules as an apple. Modern science is shooting itself in the foot by completely ignoring the possibility of consciousness transcending matter, space, and time. Time is an ocean, not a garden hose."

No one really knows what it is. They just through ideas but they stick. So is it a dream? Well some people would say it's better then reality.

Nothing similar has ever happened to my recollection, although when my mother was at her end stage in renal failure, she had moderate vascular dimentia.

I tried psilocybin mushrooms once. For about a ten hour span time was literally on shuffle for me. Long story short, it had me freaking out quite a bit at first but I finally just went with it. My gf and I were house/dog sitting for her dad. At bedtime we put the dogs in a kennel. She took the little one, I took the big one. I swear I watched him walk in and lay down as I shut and latched the door, but as I turned around there he was, tail waggin. Freaked me out again.   I know I was chemically altered and that's explanation enough but I still kinda wonder if I was seeing a little more of the true nature of time, non linear.     I'm sure you weren't on shrooms, but how about another chemical or medication? It doesn't even need to be that though, as your brain creates it's own.

That things will not always be in the last place we left them, that the teacher did not stand in the classroom doorway from when school let out to the next morning coming back in.  Prior to achieving that understanding, however, a child is easily baffled by such continuity errors which occur when things are not as he or she left them.  Nothing to do with intelligence, but rather, perception and theory of mind, perhaps your sleep addled brain experienced such a continuity error, having fallen asleep with your arm like that, and truly believed it still should have been like that.  Especially if, like /u/spreggo suggested, if your arm was asleep, then you didn't get the sensory cues that it was laying flat, so your mind (as it is apt to do) filled in the missing information of your arm's location with the assumption that it should be where it last was.  Basis: my psychology education"

I even remember the feeling of the cold wall but them I'd open my eyes. It would feel like my arm was in still in that position, hitting the wall, but I could clearly see it tucked up and pressed to my chest under the blankets.   The brain does some really strange and scary things where sleep is concerned. There's lucid dreaming, sleep paralysis etc. I think your situation is just when your brain is letting your body move again and wake up, maybe things get a little confused?

For the video game, see Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.   Phantom pain sensations are described as perceptions that an individual experiences relating to a limb or an organ that is not physically part of the body. Limb loss is a result of either removal by amputation or congenital limb deficiency.  However, phantom limb sensations can also occur following nerve avulsion or spinal cord injury.  Sensations are recorded most frequently following the amputation of an arm or a leg, but may also occur following the removal of a breast or an internal organ. Phantom limb pain is the feeling of pain in an absent limb or a portion of a limb. The pain sensation varies from individual to individual.

There were even games made of it I think for the Sega Game Gear at the time.   This is insane 'Kung Fury' sounds so wrong to me and I 100% know it is supposed to be 'King Fury'.  As for the soundtrack I can't remember any of the artists but do listen to synthwave and remember listening to songs before that were inspired by the King Fury soundtrack. If at least 1 person could say they know of King Fury then I'd be somewhat relieved. It used to be a massive thing but judging on Google searches it never existed in the current 'reality' I am in.

Most people grab hold of the surface thought that tells people to take control of their day, life etc.  But the term goes much deeper than that.  To seize the day is more a phrase that says 'live in the moment' and, of course, this is an impossible feat.  But the more you are able to accomplish this the more peace you will find.  Seizing the day is not something that will take a lot of energy to do.  Sometimes that moment in the day that you will seize is simply a low keyed, reflective moment.  Other times a moment in your day will race and pull you towards a conclusion but its the collection of viewing (living) each moment that defines 'Seize the Day'.    Perhaps your subconscious is trying to tell you to not think towards a logical conclusion as life is not built on logic.  Maybe the idea of depression comes when we think something is going to happen when we really have no clue to its certainty.  Perhaps we are no longer depressed when we live and accept each moment as they come without trying to influrence the outcome, living a trust in the idea that all will be ok and come in its own due time?"

It got me to thinking about what he'd said for a while, and I started noticing strange patterns like that in things as well.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,37eyki,Scroon,2,Thu May 28 02:17:03 2015 UTC,"I come from a large family too. My mom had five kids, and miscarried twice. One of my sisters had three kids, and miscarried three times.  The thing is, as many as 50% of pregnancies end in miscarriages. So it's not at all uncommon. It usually happens within the first three months of pregnancy. If a woman carries the child past three months, the survival rate shoots way up.  So there's nothing at all glitchy about the fact that your mom miscarried, especially considering that she got pregnant more than a handful of times. It was statistically bound to happen at one point or another.   As for the miscounting of your siblings, that's really common too. There was one time when our family was in the middle of moving (a high stress situation) when my dad asked where ""David"" was. My sisters and I have no sibling named David. Apparently, for a moment my dad was confused about how many kids he had and what their names are. I guess that can happen when you have a teenager, a preteen, and three babies."

I knew what a stillbirth was from a young age, but didn't understand what a miscarriage was until I was 10 or so.  As for miscounting my siblings, I understand where you're coming from, but it didn't just happen once. It happened to me every time I counted for the better part of fifteen years. I knew I was counting correctly, but still knew I was missing someone. For a long time I thought I was going insane because no one else seemed to miss the ""other sibling"" or wonder where (s)he was.  I feel that my miscarried sibling must have been mentioned when I was very young, at least in passing, and that's why/how I ""knew"" before anyone told me."

Sitting with girlfriend when my phone rings, saw the caller was her. I answered and it was some random girl calling telling me she had a missed call from me, I said 'nope not me sorry!' and that was the end of it. I then saw that my iPhone had saved two numbers from somewhere, god knows where, for my girlfriend! One which was hers and one which was this random who i've never spoke to before.   So don't know if it was an iPhone bug or something. I deleted the other random number from the two numbers under her contact info and that was the end of it!"

We decide to exchange numbers, so I ask for his, since my phone is set to block unknown numbers. I enter in the area code and the first two numbers and stop. My phone already knows the number. Ive never called it, it's not saved as a contact. But it knew what number I was going for. Usually if it's an unknown number, the phone wont present a guess.   Freaked us both out. We have yet to hang out."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,379tud,SparkleJumpropeQween,3,Tue May 26 01:15:26 2015 UTC,"I had that happen with an exam once:  We had three short essays to write during class. When the instructor was done grading them, he asked to speak with me privately. For one of the essays, I'd written about a different topic (but a related topic, the class was about a fairly narrow subject). I don't know why I thought that was what we were supposed to write about.   The previous year's exam had an essay about that topic. It looked pretty bad, like I'd memorized an essay written by a student from last year. I was very lucky that I'd taken a class with the instructor before and I'd always done well and had no reason to cheat, or to write what was obviously an answer to a different question. So he trusted me that it was an honest mistake and just graded the other two essays. He said maybe somehow the papers with the questions got mixed up and I got one from last year and I went along with that. But I still had the paper from the exam (we turned in our essays in a Blue Book and were allowed to keep or discard the papers with the essay questions/prompts) and I looked at it later and it was the correct one. The question on it wasn't the question I wrote about. I wrote a good essay for the question on the previous year's exam, which I'd never seen. I have no idea how that happened."

The question: How can we differentiate between ""confirmation bias"" and actual instances of prediction?  (Note: it's fine to say we can't, but that means we have no explanation one way or the other.)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,371wd0,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sun May 24 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"I understand I can't prove that this was likely to happen, but when you look at the meaning of prediction, we have to know what it means.  A prediction is a guess that someone usually says about something in the future. This is sometimes, but not always backed up by facts or evidence.  So, a guess was made by OP that later came true. Now how OP guessed it could be with some facts or evidence, random chance, or a supernatural 'glitch in the matrix'. I think the latter is the least likely.  Now, I do not think that there was anything out of the ordinary that would increase the likelihood of such a prediction. (But perhaps OP's friend wasn't fit to carry a baby and that is why she had that feeling of dread.)  So in regards to random chance, we do know something and that is that OP's prediction wasn't actually a prediction, but a paranoia. Paranoia's happen all the time and we wouldn't get paranoid if we were never paranoid about things we should worry about.  I am going to be very blunt in saying that people get paranoid all the time, and looking up how to deal with a situation before that situation could even happen isn't all that farfetched.   The fact is, OP said that OP has felt this way before and OP didn't say that OP predicted a miscarriage last time. Even if there was something else leading her to believe it, random chance is a better explanation than the paranormal."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,371wd0,SaveTheSpycrabs,3,Sun May 24 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm saying we're jumping to an explanation (rather a non-explanation) where none is warranted. That it's untestable so we should leave it open as an anecdote.  Some observations:   A prediction is a guess that someone usually says about something in the future. This is sometimes, but not always backed up by facts or evidence.   In this case, I don't think she even ""guessed"" or ""predicted"". Normally I'd say a prediction was ""statement that something is going to happen"". In this case, she ""found herself doing things"" which subsequently turned out to be consistent with events then-unknown to her. So it's more of a synchronicity (events part of a larger pattern) than a prediction.   So, a guess was made by OP that later came true. Now how OP guessed it could be with some facts or evidence, random chance, or a supernatural 'glitch in the matrix'. I think the latter is the least likely.   I'd like to emphasise that a ""glitch"" is not a supernatural event; it's not paranormal. It's an experience in ""everyday mode"" for which the experiencer has no explanation. My larger point is that we're overreaching here. It's okay to not have an explanation. Naming something doesn't explain it. ""Random chance"" or ""just a glitch"" aren't explanations at all.   The facts seem to be:   OP found herself performing actions (bad feeling, looking up miscarriage, anticipating text message). Those actions then turned out to be consistent with a subsequent event (the miscarriage).   I prefer to call it a ""synchronicity"" because that term indicates a factual pattern, without presuming a particular cause, or being dismissive. This prevents us dismissing a phenomenon simply because we don't yet - and perhaps never will - have a model or conceptual framework to put it in.  EDIT: Tidied that up a bit with paragraphs and clarification."

It's highly unlikely that anything she did caused it - they just happen, like a bad roll of the dice.  Also, if it was early on in the pregnancy and the bleeding and cramps didn't increase steadily, she should see a doctor for confirmation. It's possible to bleed a surprisingly large amount and pass a couple substantial clots and still have a pregnancy that progresses normally."

It was even more so with identical twins.  I know the movie ""Inception"" had a lot of hokum concerning lucid dreaming, but I know a lot of people have found some of the techniques in the movie to have worked.  One was to look for a ""totem"" or a ""trigger"" that would tell you you were dreaming.  Usually it'd be something out of place, like a spinning top where no spinning top belonged, unless you were in a toy store or a child's bedroom or playroom, or anything else you normally wouldn't see in your day-to-day routine.  Next time you decide to lucid dream, or end up having a dream, use your sister as your trigger.  This would work best if the scenario of the dream wouldn't normally involve her, like if it took place at your work.  Take note of what you're wearing in the dream, and what she's wearing.  To further test her, if you can, approach your sister in the dream, and say something to her you normally wouldn't say in a casual conversation.  Perhaps quote a song lyric by an artist you both like, or a line from a movie or TV show you both like.    Then the next day, e-mail or call her, and tell her about your dream.  As before, be as vague as possible, but leave out the detail of you approaching her.  If she mentions you came up to her, ask her what you were wearing.  If it matches what you had noted, then ask her what she was wearing.  If she confirms your notes, then ask her if you said anything to her.  Don't give any hint as to what you said, such as ""I quoted one of our favorite movies.  Which quote did I use?"", just ask, ""I did approach you in the dream, and I think I said something to you.  Do you remember what it was?""  Meanwhile, make sure you've written down what you've said.  If she says, ""Bazinga"", assuming you both like ""The Big Bang Theory"", then you'll know the dream-sharing was legit.  Of course, to make it work, it should be something you don't normally say to her in day-to-day conversation."

I'll give talking to her in a dream a try, although lately when I've had dreams of her she's always gotten me very angry in the dream (which is weird because we get along.)

It may seem a bit weird and probably difficult, but if you pay close attention to your emotions in your dreams, and notice how something seems out of place (you being mad at somebody at whom you'd normally would be), then you should be able to use that."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36xb96,whatusename,2,Fri May 22 23:22:45 2015 UTC,I've heard about this before and it simultaneously makes me very curious and freaks me out. My best guess is that this phenomenon has something to do with the sound barrier.

I've never heard it myself, but there was a time when there was deep, booming echo that ran through the sky about 5am and lasted for about 15 minutes a good few years ago. I put it down to being on a come down and feeling strange, but now I wonder if it was this? I'll try and find the article with the video on it I'd listened to.

The loudness is almost like it was deliberate... not exactly sure how to describe it.I knew it wasn't just me because people from other units of the apartment building were looking out the window with looks of curiosity. At first I thought it must be some fancy car honks, but then some car honked while the sound was still being played out and honks sounded that much farther away than the music."

If the store is empty (mostly talking about clothes/shoes), I'll probably avoid it, cause I'll have too much attention of employees, they will ask me, they will follow my choices, I won't feel free in there, I'll feel obliged to do everything quick, not at my pace. If there are too many people in the store, it's the same problem, I won't have so much space: there will be people by my side everywhere, so I will also feel constantly observed (and the queues don't help too, as I again feel obliged to hurry, to choose or to try cloth quicker, cause someone's waiting, etc..). It's ideal to shop in balanced conditions: there are just some customers inside, but not too much, depending on the size of the shop 2-10 maybe."

Every time it happens you believe / reinforce the pattern a little more.  Its not cause and effect but more like associative triggering.  Neither side (the pattern or your perception of it) is causing the other, but both are reinforcing each other.  One of my recurrent patterns is small electronic glitches.  All electronics that live near me behaving in odd ways.  They don't break, but always glitch.  For example, all my bedroom clocks for the last few years get stuck on California time - 3 different clocks - they are the self setting radio variety. Also the ipad gets stuck on California time if it lives in our bedroom too long.  Leave it in the living room and its not a problem.  You can consciously create these patterns if you want, but most of the time we experience them as ""life's little quirks""."

For a couple of years I worked on a small staff of writers for a TV show, and I had a coworker who looked a fair amount like me. We were both fairly tall, very skinny, had beards, wore glasses, and of course, we were both on the writing staff.

In my area, there are three different jobs - only one of them involves being on the floors, the other two are on the ground level. Because I hate the other two jobs with the passion of a thousand suns I bitched endlessly until they stopped making me do them just because it was easier for everyone to let me do what I want instead of listen to me complain for eight hours (like a child, lol). So I only do the one task day in day out (although I'm very, very good at it and terrible at everything else so it makes sense).  We work on a floor per week. This week for instance I will be on the third floor for the whole week. Sometimes we get changed floor for a day or a few hours for whatever reason, but it's not often. The only time I will leave the floor is for break time or going to the toilet. Very rarely I will take a detour on to another floor to talk to someone for a few minutes but I've only done that about three times in my entire history of working for the company.   I can be confident in knowing that I have been on the same floor for the entire day. If people say they saw me on their floor it makes no sense - even if they saw me just passing the floor on the stairwell they wouldn't mention it. ""I saw you pass by me on the stairs!"" What a weird thing that would be to mention, lol. And this is something that's been bought up more than once, if it was an isolated thing I wouldn't notice but multiple people saying they saw me? It's weird.   As well as the computer doing things in your name that it should not be able to.   I've tried to emulate exactly what happened here. Basically the system we have stops two people from getting the same order at the same time. Let's say someone called JAMES SMITH is picking up an order from a location. I go to the location and stand behind JAMES SMITH. Normally I would sign in to the location and take the order, no problem. But JAMES SMITH got there first! So if I try to sign in it will say ""USER JSMITH IS AT LOCATION"" and kick me out, making me wait until he's finished. This has happened 100% of the times I've tried to pick up a location at the same time as someone. I've been doing this for over a year and not once, not once has it allowed me to sign in to the same location as someone. Yet apparently I managed to do this on my second day? It's complete bullshit, it's impossible, I'm absolutely sure of that, it would be like starting your car up without having keys.   Although, you might have blackouts, as a more ""rational"" explanation.   I have had times where I can't recall entire days but it's only when I'm under heavy stress, and eventually I can recall what I did. It was worse when my girlfriend left me but that was years ago. There was no ""waking up"" and finding myself somewhere else experience, just difficulty remembering the shit I'd done a day before or whatever.  Also the part about my brother I would put down to him being a wuss and having bad dreams :)"

When we came outside (not even 30 seconds later) it was significantly smaller but still somewhat large.

Taking a picture of the moon while you witness the moon illusion is the way you can prove that the moon is NOT actually bigger. Compare it to another picture you take of the moon high in the sky (with the same camera), and you will see they are identically sized in your photos.  The moon illusion is about your perception - it cannot be captured in a photo.  EDIT.  Also, every time  you remember an event, you’re actually remembering the last time you remembered it. Every time you think back to that time, you may slightly increase the size of the moon in your own memory. The older the memory, the greater the chance of inaccuracy."

Depending on circumstances, these phenomena can give the impression of an actual sunset.  There are several atmospheric conditions which may cause the effect, most commonly a type of halo, caused by the reflection and refraction of sunlight by small ice crystals in the atmosphere, often in the form of cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. Depending on which variety of ""false sunset"" is meant, the halo has to appear either above the sun (which itself is hidden below the horizon) or below it (in which case the real sun is obstructed from view, e.g. by clouds or other objects), making the upper and lower tangent arc, upper and lower sun pillars and the subsun the most likely candidates.  Similarly to a false sunrise, other atmospheric circumstances may be responsible for the effect as well, such as simple reflection of the sunlight off the bottom of the clouds, or a type of mirage like the Novaya Zemlya effect.

You recently moved because something very good happened to you, or you made a life decision that feels very right and moving was part of it. Basically, things are going pretty good right now, right?  Let me know if I'm correct, and I'll tell you why. (If I'm wrong, then my theory doesn't quite work.)"

When something unusual occurs, should we, by default, trust that our awareness is receiving the correct information or second guess ourselves so that the experience fits better with conventional ideas.  I think it's possible that deja reve could be an artifact of some spurious mental proess, but at the same time, I do know that ""gut feelings"" do tell you when something is about to go wrong (or right).  For now, I'd side with the idea that deja reve is possibly telling us something, if for no other reason than because it opens up an interesting line of investigation."

It'll most likely only be very upsetting for them to hear.  I'm open to the idea that sometimes we can receive information from across the boundaries of normal three dimensional spacetime, whether its in the present and across large distances, or in the future. But I think most of us are incredibly bad at controlling what information we get, and we end up not having enough info to do anything about it.  You saw the car crash, but you didn't know who was inside. You had no way of knowing it was the mother of those kids. Had you been able to know this, you might have been able to warn her about it and save her life.  At the same time, I'm a believer that all possible outcomes do happen each in their own branching universe, so even if you were able to prevent her from dying in your own timeline, that doesn't mean she wouldn't have died in another.

For all you know you've already saved a dozen people without realizing it. When it comes to death, you do what you can but when it happens we have to accept it for what it is"

When I was about 17, I had a dream that I was in an RV with my grandparents. My grandpa had gone to the bedroom area in the back to go to sleep, while my grandmother and I were sitting at the table. After a while, we heard a noise like someone was trying to break into the back window near the bed. I went outside to investigate. It was dark, so I took a Maglite. (Heavy, sturdy flashlight.) It was a fucking panther clawing at the window near where my grandfather was asleep. I cracked that bitch in the head with the Maglite. It started bleeding out, and turning into a flawless, androgynous human body. Just before it died, it looked up at me and said ""I almost got him."" And then I woke up.  Turns out my grandfather had actually suffered a heart attack (and survived) that night, around the same time as my dream.  I understand why you feel guilty, but there's no need. There really wasn't anything you could have done to save her, even if you woke up and acted immediately. For one, you didn't realize it was her. Secondly, had you have told her, she may not have listened anyway. Most people aren't open minded to that sort of thing.  Anyway, thanks for sharing!"

Is it possible that no matter how real your dream seemed and your memory of that morning, that your mind instantly rewrote your previous night's dream as well as your memory of waking up in a cold sweat?  Usually when I get a weird premonition, I write down what I felt and what might happen somewhere. It could be on a piece of paper or a Google Doc that I keep.  I know it sounds paranoid but the mind is a very powerful machine that we still don't fully understand. I'm not saying I don't believe your story happened, but this is another possibility.

A car is behind you one second and gone the next with no where for it to go. The basic tell goes like this. A person looks in the mirror and sees a car. Looks away for a split second and checks the mirror again and the car is gone. No turn offs or side roads for it to take is also a common theme of these tells.

A bad day in a year is a bump in the road. A bad day in a lifetime is a slight wrinkle in the tapestry. Keep on living to erase the bad day. :)  Edit: To give some perspective into this, I've never been depressed up to the point where I wanted to end my life, but I definitely had dangerous thoughts like everyone around me would be better off if I didn't exist, etc. For two years of my life, I had forgotten how it felt to wake up happy. I would go to bed and wake up every day with a heavy weight on my chest. Even when I was with friends and having fun, a part of my mind was always occupied with the mess I had landed my life in. I couldn't even begin to comprehend the fact that I would be better one day, but eventually, I did. Things changed when I accepted my life for what it was, and took definitive action to make it better. The biggest lesson I learned from the entire thing was that the only thing stopping me from having a better life was the fear of the consequences of my actions. I was afraid to take action to improve my situation (for various reasons that I can't delve into). Once I manned up and owned up to my mistakes, my life dramatically improved over the coming weeks and I can finally sleep peacefully again :) Like I said, at the time, those 2 years of my life seemed like an eternity in madness. But having moved past that, I can now look back and see that it's a bump in the road of my life.

Because at that level of existence ""you/we"" are/would be an immortal and completely alone entity/being. Which truth is it would also could be related to the idea that everything is a dream. Meaning that we are creations of that one entity dreaming (the only possible escape from its loneliness). So when all the possible ""dreams""/versions of our current level character die, the consciousness would jump to the next upper/higher level. Same for each one of us and anything in existence. Until in the end all characters and dreams over dreams would end. And that being would wake up, feeling immortal, and alone again."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36kdze,Scroon,39,Sat May 23 19:26:51 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking a lot about ""quantum suicide"" recently, and some of my thoughts might be relavant to your situation.  First two things.  1) I've had ""near death"" experiences myself, and in each instance there's been a ""discontinuity"" in my awareness, that's made me think something unusual may have happened. During one episode, I visited a ""waiting room"" that's made me think that there's something much stranger going on with our existence than we think.  2) Occasionally, I've had dreams where I find myself in a different location with completely different friends/people around me, doing things I've never done or wouldn't even think of doing. These could just be random dreams, but part of me thinks that they could possibly be glimpses of alternate lives or alternate paths I could have taken. This would agree with the ""Enviroview"" dream that you had.  So - I've been thinking that perhaps we are set on some sort of narrative journey, and there is a time for us to ""die"" and the narrative to come to an end. (See that ""waiting room"" post for the reason I think this.) The criteria for things to ""end"" could be that there's something we have to learn, or maybe there's a predetermined ""ending"" or ""endings"" we need to get to, or it could be this life ends when we feel that we're ready.  Certain suicides or unintentional deaths may cause us to keep on going in the closest narrative to the one we prematurely ended. It's like switching movie theaters because the movie projector broke down unexpectedly, but we still get to finish the movie.  So I wouldn't say that life is ""inescapable"". Perhaps we just need to reach the right ending. But who knows. I do feel, however, that something might be looking out for us and making sure that we don't go too far astray.  Life is so strange. For all the good and all the bad, I hope you enjoy it while you're here."

It indicates that the author doesn't want their writing to be the bare minimum needed to get their point across, but instead to be entertaining and enjoyable to the audience.   Clearly, some people in this sub expect the former approach, and feel that a more elaborate narrative undermines the author's credibility and/or intentions. My guess is that a terse and simplistic style is received as more genuine because it presumably wasn't edited, reworked, or written over multiple sessions or a wide time frame- kind of like how a witness statement might be written (i.e. a person recounting a series of events to the best of their knowledge with only the necessary level of detail).  Personally, I think it's just as easy to lie in either format and I don't think style is a reliable indicator of authenticity."

That's mostly been the case here. When commenters are nasty about it, their comments get deleted.  Particularly above, the topic of the material is sensitive (suicide as a means of ""jumping"" out of situations), so people are extra-cautious and looking for signs of fiction. GITM is really about the event being interesting rather than the telling being entertaining. When something sensitive reads as entertaining, people pause a little.  OP's responses have been good - although defensive - and I think that means we've generally got the right approach. Having a debate about authenticity as well as the subject matter is part of the discussion.  It ain't /r/nosleep (""treat it as true"") and the FAQ is direct about that."

Maybe I'm not familiar with ""nosleep"", but this story seemed very authentic to me.  There are a lot of details you wrote about that don't seem like an author would necessarily make up - random, convoluted details, stuff that doesn't really matter to the story but would happen in a real life.

It's like trying to not-think about a white elephant by saying ""don't think about white elephants!"" over and over again.  It's basically the law of attraction.  If you keep thinking ""I hate my life, I want to run away from it all"", you are just perpetuating being stuck in situations that will make you keep having those kinds of thoughts and feelings.  But to move forward, you have to accept where you are and let your feet make contact with the ground, if that makes sense.  Eventually you will grow bored with these feelings and thoughts of helplessness and move on effortlessly, once you learn to let go.  In the meantime, mark my words: the bigger picture is that you are in control, you are the creator of your reality, all-powerful and all-knowing, you are just challenging yourself right now with some extreme experiences, that is all."

Still bad, but very different from chugging the whole bottle at once with the meds.   I kinda looked into it because I'm bored and curious- assuming he was prescribed at least 300mg/day (normal dose for Wellbutrin/Bupropion if you've been on it for a while) he would have a bottle of 60 150mg pills (he said he just refilled his meds so I'm guessing it was full) that's about 9 grams, which according to some sites is the minimum amount you can have a fatal overdose on. That's the minimum though, people have survived doses of 30+ grams before.   However, some people take high doses because it works as a hallucinogen. I used to mess around with pills in high school, I took 3 grams of Wellbutrin XL one time and it was a strange, unsettling trip. Perhaps OP passed out for a day or two from the NyQuil (taking a whole bottle of NyQuil will make you want to sleep for days) and then woke up still tripping. Maybe the overdose messed with his brain... considering what he overdosed on, I think that could be possible.  NOT saying OP is lying, or trying to discredit his story!

When a parallel version of yourself dies their memories bleed through to the other versions of themselves.   Hence you didn't attempt suicide. You have always been you. You are the version of yourself that had the beers and the muddy dog prints. What happened is a version of you, very close in the dimensions, did commit suicide and you now have a strong feeling of connection to him. His memories have been dispersed across the dimensions to those most closely following his life path."

Most often, people with these experiences simply don't recall them with such sordid detail or imagery. Phrases like 'I was in sheer awe.' are too flowery. The ""'That's odd' I thought to myself"" reads way too fiction-like.  Also, the line breaks act as more proof (in my humble opinion) that this is too well-written and dissected to read as a ""holy shit you guys I just died and came back"".

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36kdze,SilentWord7,6,Wed May 20 02:10:01 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that it involves progressive levels numbered 1 to 7, of which 1 is rock, 2 is animal, 3 is human level of awareness where you choose whether to progress via separation and love for self, or harmony and love for others. 4 has a deep focus on love (for self or others, as you chose), 5 has a deep focus on wisdom, 6 is integration of love and wisdom and unification of the two paths. 7 is then preparation to return to oneness with the all.  My understanding is that this involves millions of years of incarnation experience, total.  It sounds like you're going through a particularly rough time right now. However, for most people, the main way to progress from 3 to 4 is, through many lifetimes, learning how to love.  The test for passing to the next level involves seeing how much of the Creator's love you can take. You have to have balanced yourself enough to tolerate the amount of love that is available at the next level.  You are an aspect of the Creator, and your experience is useful. You can't really escape creation, because creation is all there is. But you can balance yourself so as to be able to reunite with the all.

He had to completely realize and understand the reality/world he was living in was fake before, to know where to find a way to get out.   Same here in the physical world.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36kdze,TriumphantGeorge,2,Wed May 20 08:42:40 2015 UTC,"This is a great concept and one that I've thought about often before. The only thing that doesn't ring correct for me in your account is that you'd be aware of your consciousness travelling and have memories of your older life. I think those things are tied up in your physical brain, and once you kill it, or it dies generally, all that stuff is gone. Your consciousness doesn't have any capacity for storing information, it's literally just a ""lifespark"" or a soul if you will. So whilst the concept of consciousness travelling to parallel versions of yourself when the body it's stored in dies is an interesting concept to me, the claim that you'd have memories of these previous bodies is an impossible glitch imo."

It would be always the same, static, a robot or like empty clones. If you believe in the concept of soul you must believe experience and evolving is an essential part of it and this is where memories come into place and have to be a part of the soul acquired experience.

Been trying to figure certain things out and collabing with people ever since. Seems I get surrounded by people that had NDE, suicide attempts, oders, comas, head trippers, etc. As for the category of people that I ""think"" committed suicide as I knew a handful of them. Two guys that were friends of mine actually had the gun in their mouth and was about to pull the trigger then came to some realization and the other group of people just had a gun the one night and just joking around with it putting it up to their head or in their mouths. I speak of these people cause I kind of have this feeling that they really did pull the trigger and like your story merge with a different reality. I'm also pretty sure you can't escape your own reality just by ending it, getting murder might be a different story but that's a whole thing within itself, natural exits etc.  But I wanted to talk about what happens afterwards. Seems like depending on the circumstances that led up to the suicide depends on the reasoning which led you there in the first place. It is almost like you will have things compensate for the shit you had to deal with or at least now given the power to deal whatever ordeal which one was dealing with. Now that everything is done now they have to move on to something different or just plain better. In some cases it seems like the suicide was expected from the individual and it was there just massive transition in their timeline. Then some were just screwed and now get to experience something better kind of like ""heaven"". There is a ton of stuff I kind of concluded but I almost feel the human language has nowhere to explaining just how intrinsic this all is. Could be that it is not really intrinsic at all but almost like it doesn't want to explained which it shouldn't.  Also that remembrance of other side is cool.

Both are variations on ""eternalism"" - where the observer is a consciousness which ""selects"" moments and trajectories according to knowledge, habit, belief and intention. In the early 1900's there was a notion of a ""serial universe"" (JW Dunne, E Douglas Fawcett, in modern times: Julian Barbour) which was static and multidimensional, with us being ""observers"" whose attention explores the memory-block.  The way to imagine this stuff in everyday life is to see that ""all time, everywhere"" is dissolved into the background space of the experience you are having right now, but only one aspect is ""unfolded"" into sensory experience - very much like a holographic space.  In all cases, all possible experiential patterns are available at all times. You might think of similarly-formatted experiences as being ""a universe"", but the continuity of your experiences has more to do with the stability of your own personal patterns, rather than some external set of ""places"" that you travel between."

What if the brain receives consciousness from an external source rather than creating consciousness?

Like most everyone I doodled and could draw Garfield and Snoopy, drew roses and horses but never very good and it wasn't something that I was really very interested in. In 2012 I became obsessed. I'm obsessed with doing portraits, still not very skilled yet but 100% better than what I was in school (we had to do a portrait for our final project in art in 9th grade) I got a c for effort! That's how bad it was, but now I am that much better and even though it's not perfect, it isn't awful either. I even have sketch pads and pencils, chalks, and charcoal. It's really very weird that I became so obsessed because I never gave a rat's patooty that I had no skill at drawing, now I'm completely into it. What's weirder yet is falling asleep and having no skill or even want to do it, and waking up and producing a picture on paint that nobody believes that you could have done! On a computer, no less! It's quite strange.     I've been slacking though, haven't touched my utensils or sketched in over 2 months now."

Taylor said she has also suffered emotionally from the accident, which cost her many of her friends because of her change in personality. She's looking forward to meeting more friends when she starts at Des Moines Area Community College in the fall, where she wants to study event planning.    I agree that in this case it's easy to understand how someone who just went through a terrible physical and emotional trauma (and memory loss) is a ""different person"" without resorting to glitchy explanations.

What happened to you in the parking lot?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36gviv,carrottopseyebrows,11,Sat May 23 06:52:17 2015 UTC,"I was on the way to my stepfather's birthday part in at a normal family restaurant, probably in late 2005. The restaurant was is one of those huge parking lots in front of a strip mall with lots of smaller fast food joints in the front by the main road. It was about a long suburban block in length. Nothing unusual, especially for the midwest. Clear line of sight all around.  I turned in too soon, so I was at the other end of the parking lot from the restaurant.   There was a closed Taco Bell that I had to drive by before I could get to the restaurant....probably 1500 feet away from where I was going.  I could see the restaurant clearly, but as I tried to drive past the Taco Bell, there was a barrier/curb in the way. I figured that the restaurant I was going to had its parking lot blocked off for the patrons only and turned the car to find the actual entrance. Drove around and around, mostly around that Taco Bell and could not get out. There was a barrier or curb in every direction. I couldn't even tell where I came in.  I must have looked like a right idiot.  I'm pretty sure I did this for about 10 - 15 minutes, and covered the same 5000 feet of parking lot 20 times. It was like I was in an enclosed square of asphalt.  I could still see the restaurant but it was like it was in a completely different place. Vague feeling of unease.  I could see the main road too, and everything seemed normal with traffic driving past.  But it's kind of creepy driving past a closed Taco Bell again and again and again.  Anyway,  I'd been stuck in that spot so long, I was now late and I started to get pissed off.  I LOVE fairy tales, folklore and mythology. Hell, in another life, I was probably Comic Book Guy. I started to think the whole situation seemed like what I'd read about being pixie-led, so I decided to try turning a piece of clothing inside out. Happened to be wearing gloves, took but a moment to turn one inside out, and once I did, I immediately saw the opening to the restaurant parking lot.  It wasn't hard to miss either.....they weren't blocked off.  I could drive straight there.  Got there 5 minutes late, parked with no problems, no problems when I left. Getting stuck could have been me being unobservant, but there was no way to get stuck. That parking lot was wide open.  I don't remember seeing people while affected except for the traffic on the main road, but it's been a while. I've always kind of hoped something like that would happen again, but it hasn't. Of course, I've always heard it doesn't if you go looking for it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36gviv,Xaielao,12,Sat May 23 07:12:32 2015 UTC,You should share that story.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36gviv,carrottopseyebrows,30,Tue May 19 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"Shortly told, I was with a friend walking from his girlfriends house to the local store maybe half a mile away around sunset. We are taking a fairly well traveled path through the woods when we spot this growth of vines that looked totally like a gate with a thin trail beyond. We decide to walk the trail, it leads us into an open field where both of us get this feeling like we weren't supposed to be there. One of us mentioned it and the other confirmed, like a feeling in the belly. We turn back, go to the store and walk home to talk about the experience. By this time it is dark but we have no idea how late it is. To us the entire trip - including walking that path - was maybe an hour. Buddies girlfriend is freaking out cause turns out it's nearly midnight and we'd been gone for hours."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36gviv,Xaielao,6,Tue May 19 21:29:47 2015 UTC,That's crazy. I'm assuming you've never seen that 'vine gate' ever since? It'd be interesting to see what was down that path.

At what point did you look to see that you lost 5 hours? What was your reaction and your friend's reaction to both turning around to see the store was there and realizing that you lost 5 hours?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36gviv,bananensap,23,Tue May 19 14:17:19 2015 UTC,"Yes when we saw the store a short way off we did head to the store. This may seem odd to some but we did this for a number of reasons.  1. People, after being wherever we were being were there was light and traffic seemed like a good idea. 2. Both my friend and I wanted something cold to drink and felt very dehydrated after the whole experience. Needed a cigarette more than ever after that experience. 3. More than anything wanted to look at someone else's phone or clock.  We had noticed the time was ""missing"" just prior the heading back in the direction towards his Aunt's place, around 11:30.  I felt like we were kind of on ""autopilot"" so to speak, we just wanted to get to the store and were in a state of shock. When we got there we began to talk more about it. My friend wanted to go to the emergency room out of fear he had a stroke that's how frightening this whole experience was. I talked him out of it as we would be branded as crazy and given a 72 hour old. Now after we had a smoke outside the store I called a cab to come get us. We took it back to his Aunt's home to check on the dogs quickly and then took it back cross town to my house to spend the night needless to say neither of us got much sleep that night.   We were talking about the experience all night and couldn't really ascertain exactly what had happened to us. I held a bit more of an inclination towards the paranormal but my friend is a staunch atheist and refused to accept that as an explanation. After that night he wouldn't speak of it again for a few months and when he brought it up he deemed it to be an unusual experience with no explanation but definitely not anything sinister. As for me I really do believe it was some sort of tear in the fabric of our reality."

It was going to where he was already long dead. (He died in his sleep of an enlarged heart, unknown until the autopsy.)   I am a huge skeptic of supernatural things, but the things surrounding my dad and my brother and their deaths I can't explain. Death is weird that way.

We don't really know why he's so angry, but I've wanted to light a candle for him ever since.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36f6oh,sheddinglikeamofo,5,Tue May 19 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"I only 'know' what I've theorized on.   I think all time is running at the same time. But just like a 2D object can only see and percieve one part of a 3D object (it's height OR its width OR its depth) we as 3D objects are only able to see and perceive part of the 4th dimension of time. For us, time runs in one direction, but to a hypothetical 4th dimension being, time may all be visible at once. The story Flatland explains this much better than I.   I imagine that time might run in a spiral from our perspective, like a tightly coiled slinky or spring. Maybe events or 3D objects can 'bleed' or seep from one coil to its neighboring coil above or below it. From our perspective it would seem like we were seeing 'future' events (i.e. precognition) or 'past' events. (i.e. ghosts)  Of course, this is only theory on my part. :-) But it's a pretty theory and it makes me feel like I understand a little about time. Maybe it'll help others too.   Now as far as 'alternate' universes go, take the slinky comparison one step further and imagine there are many slinkies existing either next to each other or probably more likely, existing layered over the top of each other in the same space as the original one. Much like a hologram could be layered over the top of an object without taking up more space.   Imagining it this way we can have movement not only between coils of the slinky (past and future from our point of view,) as well as between different slinkies themselves, (Mandela effects).

In both cases though, the Doppelganger was somewhere out in public, not in my home! Also, it was years and years ago, so I feel somewhat better about it- hopefully it won't happen again. It's been 30 years since my last evil one (though only a year since I had a benign one).  My mom found an evil Doppelganger of one of her neighbours sitting on her living room floor one night! The Doppelganger was just sitting there, staring at her with a really evil smile, not speaking. My mom thought that maybe she had had a fight with her husband, and was upset. She turned her back on her for a second, and when she turned around, the woman was gone.   She went to the apartment to see her, but only her husband was home- the wife was at work. My mom didn't know about Doppelgangers, and neither did the couple, but the woman had had other similar things happen, and they thought that it was perhaps a ghost of a twin that maybe died in the womb.  I think about the Doppelganger thing a lot, even though it hasn't happened to me for years- I worry that maybe it is still happening, but I don't know that it is and maybe people just think that I am an evil bitch (my Doppelganger swears at strangers in public, and when a friend or relative goes up to them to ask what is happening, the Doppelganger turns and swears at them! In real life, I am very mild mannered and would never, have never sworn at anyone!).  Sometimes I wonder if my Doppelganger is me somehow me projecting myself out into the world in a more aggressive, angry way-maybe to make up for how nice I am in real life. Maybe I want to break out and 'be bad'!  Also, my Doppelganger has been seen at times when I definitely was somewhere else- so it's not me having some kind of split personality.

Stories typically include instances that are nearly déjà vu in substance, but in reverse, where a spirit with the subject's footsteps, voice, scent, or appearance and overall demeanor precedes them in a location or activity, resulting in witnesses believing they've seen or heard the actual person before the person physically arrives. This bears a subtle difference from a doppelgänger, with a less sinister connotation. It has been likened to being a phantom double, or form of bilocation. In Finnish folklore, the concept is known as etiäinen.     Interesting: List of legendary creatures (V) | Endtime Productions | Doppelgänger | Bilocation   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

The point is, shortly after I wake up, with the story and elements still fresh on my mind I try to recall them, list em and think along the day trying to make a sense out of it. For example I check on online for meanings despite most of the websites are utterly useless sometimes I get a sensible meaning out of it .  Something is for sure, nightmares, when they happen something bad is about to happen, like mi mind giving me a warning on a subject, It depends on the elements composing the dream.   Funny thing and dont know if related, sometimes I lay donw or get relaxed and my mind just wanders, the thing is I think I can recall in those pretty moments others moments of my life, as for three years ago I was in the sofa doing that and I connected with mysellf last week.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36dzui,rebellas,6,Mon May 18 17:15:06 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of an interesting story one of my students told me. He is an adult ESL student in a city China (where I am) and comes from a rural village.  Every Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) he returns home to his village to spend the holiday with his family. In 2004 when he returned, something odd happened. He was indoors when he heard a clanging sound like a massive metal chain being rattled, but not a human-sized chain, one that stretched across the sky. He said the sound was loud and clear. Alarmed, he ran outside and saw all of his neighbors also standing outside staring at the sky in amazement. There was nothing visible though the sky was clear at the time.  One of his neighbors began picking up rocks and assorted objects and hurling them in the direction of the sound, which appeared to be moving across the sky slowly in a north-to-south direction. This behavior confused my student at first, but he later discovered the reason.  After a long while the sound disappeared into the southern part of the sky and was not heard again.  The next day my student was speaking to some elderly villagers and they told him the legend of the sound, which they call the Money Dragon. The legend is that it's a dragon which, though invisible, may be heard flying across the sky from north to south once every 70 years. Some of the older people remembered hearing the ""dragon"" when they were children.  The legend further tells that if you manage to strike the Money Dragon with an object as it flies, it will drop gold coins. The closer to the head you strike, the greater the reward. You can't see the coins fall out of the sky, but if you dig in your garden before 5 am after hitting the Money Dragon, you will find gold coins. Apparently there were some corroborations of this, people claiming to have successfully struck the Money Dragon and found coins.  The coins are easy to explain, as all over China there are caches of valuable coinage, most of it quite old, and people are always accidentally coming across them while digging in fields or gardens.  The noise the people heard? Not so much. Only every 70 years, that's the kicker."

It was a very low tone and not blaringly loud, but enough to hear from inside a house. When I went outside the sound seemed to be coming from everywhere and nowhere. So I got on my bicycle and started biking around my very hilly neighborhood looking for this sound. I was out for about 40 minutes and never found the source. The next day, however - I forget who exactly I talked to - maybe the police station - someone told me that it was construction on the local highway.

I certainly hope I have an encounter with it again one day because it did feel like a positive force and I regret being such a chicken about it. I even felt like the fact that I suddenly freaked out and wished it away was the reason it dissipated because before that moment I wasn't afraid of it and it lingered around.

I remember pacing up and down the hallway in a growing state of panic and horror at an exponentially increasing, impossible number... My fear was that this number was violating some very basic precept of the world, an assumption we hold that absolutely should not be violated.   i find it utterly bizarre that these dreams are so common, because it suggests that there's some part of the brain that associates these ideas of shape and scale with ineffable horror -- what possible purpose could that serve?  some of these dreams sound quite similar to salvia experiences, and salvia is unique among recreational drugs in that its primary mode of action is agonism of the kappa opioid receptor. [interestingly, while kappa agonism results in the same pain-killing effects as other classes of opioid receptors, it induces dysphoria rather than euphoria]. perhaps these experiences are caused by your brain getting bombarded with dynorphin, the endogenous  κ-opioid ligand?   but even if my half-baked theorizing is true, the question of why is there a part of the human brain that generates terrifying visions of infinite/infinitesimal geometric shapes and quantities??? still remains. rest assured though that you are not alone."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36gdxz,CK_Crash,3,Tue May 19 05:08:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would have never guessed that I would subscribe to such theories.  But 3 years ago about I saw a lot of people posting about 'a great spiritual awakening, we are about to enter a reality where the rules change' and a lot of them talked about how as long as you think about something to the point where you believe it on a subconscious level and once you get to that level of belief you stop dwelling on the idea and just keep positive vibes about all things you will likely get what you wanted as long as it wasn't a vague or physically impossible notion.    Spring of 2013 I decided to try it earnestly.  I was at a point in my life where basically I was in a freefall towards an early death.  So I basically 'willed' that I would find a girl, become best friends with her, marry her, have a child and buy a house.  (When I started this I was penniless and had 18k worth of debt)  within a month I found a girl, we were instantly best friends, and 15 months later I had a child and a house.  If you could see me at the beginning and 15 months later you would belief I was the same person.    I've kept doing it since then too, needed a job bad and was failing at finding one.  'Put my mind to work' had a great job almost immediately.   So as weird as it is I am convinced that this stuff works. But now I find myself hesitant to use it.  Maybe because of the words 'chaos magic' associated with it."

Now, maybe I was just a great worker and they wanted more where that came from, but I feel like all the thoughts I spent on it must have helped out.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36gdxz,lilyvale,1 point,Tue May 19 16:38:19 2015 UTC,"I've had that also,and I always feel it in my gut.Sometimes I get a bad feeling,then a different feeling in the tummy for something good.Plus sometimes I know somewhat what will happen along with the feeling,and other times just have the bad or good feeling,with no other info.It comes and goes.Sometimes I seem to know some things a bit ahead of time,sometimes some important stuff happens and I'm as clueless as everyone else.The not knowing sometimes happens for long periods of time,I haven't had the tummy feeling for quite a while now.  My working theory is that maybe when things like this happen our brain is calculating probabilities and likelihoods of things we aren't consciously aware of to go to a likely outcome,at least I think that might be what mine is.  I've also had exactly what I want to happen occur as long as I'm sure of it and feeling positive that it will.However,if I try it on purpose,I can't be positive enough for it to happen,I have to be in the right frame of mind."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36gdxz,lisabauer58,1 point,Tue May 19 13:06:18 2015 UTC,"There is this state of being where someone feels a sense of giddiness from an anticipation of events that they know will unfold.  It rings of a positive effect making the person feel as if there is an energy surrounding an immediate event that will occur just seconds or minutes within our future timeline.  This feeling is called Fey.  I am not sure if the person controls the outcome of the event, or its a warning of something that will occur, or the possibilty that the person has tapped into an engery of a chain of events that are not changeable.  But that sense of fey we feell seem to accompany these knowings.  Sometimes I wonder if our brain picks up bits and pieces of our envirnoment that we over look but since our brain reconizes them and has seen what these series of data has previously produced as a result that the brain sends the conclusion it predicts from the information it has gathered that we were not aware of consciously.  But then there comes moments that no matter what the situation is, the outcome that is known can never be predicted.  So much of this stumps me.  But, I will admit, that I always feel fey when it happens.  Is it neccessary to feel that emtion to be able to tap into it?  Maybe and maybe not. :)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36gdxz,lisabauer58,3,Tue May 19 15:10:53 2015 UTC,"Like I said in the original post I've experienced this a lot.  And I've even, on some occasions, had the foresight to tell someone that I'm with exactly what will happen and they are always amazed when it does happen.    I've even experienced it as a group once.  I hope this doesn't turn this into a political thing, but I was in Iraq with an infantry unit.  This was at the end of our tour and at a time when we were all very very complacent.  No one gave a crap anymore or feared getting hurt.  Most of the guys had stopped wearing their armor plates and basically every precaution was ignored.  We were getting ready to leave the base to go try to set up an ambush to see if we can catch people trying to dig up a weapons cache that we had a pretty good idea of where it was.  This was a completely routine mission, we had done others like it dozens of times.  There was no reason to suspect this one would be any different.  So we are all getting the equipment into the trucks and everyone (12 of us) stopped dead in our tracks and all faced each other and spoke the same words at the same time 'this is going to go bad, put your armor on'.  The feeling I felt right before we all stopped was one of impending doom.  And wouldn't you know it my truck was blown up 5 minutes later.  Had we not tightened everything up we probably would have died.    That was actually my first instance ever of feeling this 'ability'  In the years since it's happened so often that it's strange.  One time I had a gut feeling to move my head a foot to the right.  Not even a second later a truck passed and kicked up a fist size rock and sent it flying like a bullet right where my head was, it hit the side of a van and punched a hole clean through the side panel.    I've done a bit of research into theories around this and the two most prominent ones that I've seen are 'you get this feeling because somehow you tap into the events of another universe/you were in that other universe and upon impending death your soul jumped to the closest most similar universe where you survive that event just before you die in the original one' and the fey theories 'there isn't a multivariate but you tapped into some kind of meta-energy'   I guess at this point I'm trying to decide which one is more plausible but I have no idea how one could even apply any kind of testing to figure that question out.  I suppose the fey theory falls more in line with the occult/chaos magic stuff."

I did it just to prove to my brother that what I'm experiencing is not déjà Vu and I'm really dreaming the future. So I wrote it down, put it in an envelope and gave it to my brother, after the event occurred, I told him to open the letter and read it. He was pretty freaked out. This was a few years ago.

It begins with its point of view rather than argue towards it.  If the Mandela Effect can be reduced to:  ""A group of independent people recalling the same version of history, a history which is contrary to present-day evidence and others' recollection of the events.""  Then false memories or the bandwagon effect aren't really appropriate. Something else, such as an effect of perception (that we tend to ""see what we know"" rather than what is there) - or more controversially perhaps there is some sort of memory-sharing/leakage effect - seems a better bet.   But, y'know, without actual theorising and testing, all this is just as much story-making as Fiona Broome. Saying that something is ""false memories"" without having done any study or deeper thinking, is on about the same level as saying ""parallel timelines"" really.  We seem to have this urge to need everything be closed and complete (it is this) rather than leave it open or unaccounted for, even if the true extent of our knowledge doesn't warrant any conclusion.   Really, the Mandela Effect amounts to: ""there's this quirky observation; there are some fun and some dismissive ideas about it; we don't know and may never know""."

This terms actually means a group coming together and in their shared reality CREATING false information, which each individual in the group then feels is the true reality. A group coming together already believing false or incorrect information has nothing to do with the bandwagon effect. You can argue in a number of ways against the Mandela effect, but you can't place it as a bandwagon effect since people are coming together in groups to discuss having false information, and discussing theories about why. They aren't trying to convince anyone an actor is dead, or television was changed. Only that they each have a memory that doesn't jive with known events.

Obviously if you aren't interested in it anymore that's fine, regardless of what you believe, but the effect shows up here even outside of the dedicated thread for it so you may come in contact with a few instances of it.  The most common effects are Berenstain Bears (remembered as Berenstein), the location of New Zealand in relation to Australia, remembering Billy Graham's funeral being broadcast with a bunch of blue, what color Chartreuse actually is, definitely being spelled definately originally, Interview with the Vampire (they remember Interview with a Vampire), Henry VIII holding a turkey leg in a famous portrait, and of course, Mandela dying in prison in the early 80s.  Call them false memories or alternate realities or whatever, when a LARGE group of people remember something one way or another, it starts to become more compelling.  The issue I personally have is that some people are so darn convinced whatever their theory is is the only possible solution that they refuse to entertain the possibility that there could be another explanation.  ""Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever's left, however improbable, must be the truth"" -- gotta entertain the alternate before saying for sure that you've shifted into whatever reality I've been in my entire life (because it appears I don't have Mandela Effects, from what I can tell)."

Off the top of my head:   Governor Jerry Brown:  I actually just moved away from California recently, and clearly remember Arnold Schwarzenegger still being in office when I left.  He was re-elected.  I keep up with news & politics on a fairly consistent basis, as well.  After moving to my new state, I read an article with ""Governor Jerry Brown"" in the title and automatically assumed they were reflecting on his first term in office.  I was in absolute shock when I read that he is the current Governor of California.  Impossible.  I do share this ""Mandela Effect"" with my husband, as well.  He clearly remembers Schwarzenegger being the current Governor, as well.  The ""Commonwealth"" of Kentucky:  Reading that Kentucky is a commonwealth.  I grew up by Kentucky, I've been in Kentucky more times than I can recall.  I've even gotten speeding tickets in Kentucky that I've had to write an envelope out for and place in the mail to pay.  It was never The Commonwealth of Kentucky, it was the State of Kentucky.  My husband shares this ""Mandela Effect"" with me, as well.  It also doesn't sit right knowing that Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia are also Commonwealths.  I'm certain I would have learned this in school, I was highly proficient in Government and History classes, though I have never actually been to these ""Commonwealths.""  The Narwhal:  This was a fictional creature when I initially heard of it, roughly few years or so ago.  There were only cartoons of this creature and it was meant as comedy.  I studied marine life extensively, since I was a young girl.  I am certain that if this creature existed, it would have definitely been my favorite.  I always loved the cartoon drawings of it, and would even search for them, there were never any actual photos of this creature.  When I saw the first picture of an actual Narwhal, I figured it was photoshopped.  Imagine my shock when I googled the creature again and found out it was real.  If anyone else shares these ""Mandela Effects"" with me, please let me know."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36aqax,TriumphantGeorge,2,Mon May 18 17:41:12 2015 UTC,"Go look for The Last Unicorn.  I think you'd enjoy it :)  I don't think it's a bad article per se, but the author immediately dismisses everything as a false memory without really exploring the implications.  On the other hand, it's learning that a possible regional variant isn't what the rest of the world uses.  I remember learning the words Adaption and Advertize when I was a kid, just before a large rise in the Internet and instant news.  Apparently adaption is the uncommon version of Adaptation, so when I first read it on TV Tropes, on an article I'd looked at ten or so times now, I realized it said ""Adaptation Decay,"" not ""Adaption Decay.""  I guess I was reading it the latter way, because that's how my mind was used to seeing it.  Blew my mind, that day, and so I did a little research."

This is an excellent point on some of the spelling differences.  I haven't seen many like the one you've mentioned here called Mandela Effects, but the ones you've mentioned are great (adaption v. adaptation, which are actually both spelled correctly and are correct words; advertise v. advertize could be a mistake based on the s v. z US versus UK English thing, although advertise is correct in both there are a lot of words like organize v. organise or realize v. realise that follow this rule).  Some of the other spelling differences, though, I'm kind of convinced that it is just mistakes in spelling based on the really bizarre rules in the English language.  Written English is just stupid sometimes."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36aqax,michikade,1 point,Mon May 18 21:04:35 2015 UTC,"True that.  I once was on a forum, and someone's sig line was,  'English doesn't borrow from other languages.  It follows them into dark alleyways, mugs them, and checks their pockets for loose change.'  Something like that.  English is... well, it's an old language, and has its quirks like every other language that has existed for forever, but still.  Modern English only partly resembles Old English, in a lot of cases.  Pun intended.  Don't get me started on singular/plural tenses and the lack of an agreed on neutral pronoun..."

If multiple people share the same memory and details independently, (i.e. they don't know each other and couldn't have influenced each other) and nothing can be found that would explain it.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36aqax,SaxonWitch,1 point,Tue May 19 15:20:03 2015 UTC,"I think that especially if it is just false memories, science should listen up. The best reason for this is that if we can prove that such a large amount of people believe something different from the other, how wrong are accounts about history?  We all believe that what we read about history is 'set in stone' and live our lives with this knowledge. Imagine how different history probably was to what's written down by a few who 'remember it to have been that way'?  If anything this is a psychological phenomenon that should be 'a thing' if we want to learn about our fallibility as humans.  On the other hand, I can't rule out dimension slips either, even if it may only be 0.01%, it is not entirely imposssible. To say so is incredibly ignorant of what science has found out in the last few years."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,36aqax,michikade,0,Sat Jun 6 06:05:13 2015 UTC,"Human memory is inherently fallible, selective and highly suggestible.  However, the Mandela Effect tends to be when someone or a group remembers something differently after years have passed, and usually something that doesn't affect them directly.  A lot of people mention things that they remember happening 15-20 years ago or more, usually from their childhoods, and there's a reason why ""when I was a child"" stories are against this sub's rules.  People do not tend to have Mandela Effects about things they are directly attached to and study on a daily basis, so I wouldn't think historians specifically have the issue with the events they personally study.  However, falsely remembering things is where a lot of folklore, myths and legends come from, from back when things were passed down by word of mouth rather than in writing."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,TotesMessenger,23,Sat May 16 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"So hey, as I promised, here is some interesting stuff about the relationship between seizures and ... well hell, I don't know how to put it. Just hang in there with me. :)  So back in college, I took a course called neurotheology. It is what it sounds like- basically, the neuroscience of belief in God/spirituality. What we learned is that there are certain parts of the brain which are responsible for either one or the other: creating the illusion of connecting to something Higher- and generating so-called spiritual experiences, OR: the actual doorway [in our brains] that opens up the conduit to make to spiritual connections possible. The ""doors of perception,"" if you will. (A respectful nod to Aldous Huxley. Read that book, if you haven't. It's about him having spiritual experiences while tripping on peyote. His musings are in direct reference to aforementioned part of the brain. Also, if you didn't know, that's where the band: The Doors- got their name!)   And for the record: I don't just mean Judeo-Christian stuff; I also mean the altered states people reach during meditation, near-death experiences, people who believe the can talk to spirits, etc. -all of that.  Anyway, some of this is theory and conjecture, but here is a piece that's scientifically valid. There is a part of our brains that's directly responsible for delineating ""self"" from ""other."" Sounds simple, but it's sort of mind-blowing if you think about it. We take that separation for granted, but if that part of your brain is 'off' for a period of time (and as it turns out, it is!!- during a grand-mal [AKA tonic-clonic] seizure), that means you honestly lose your..... YOU. There is simply awareness, but not self-awareness.   In that state- say, during a seizure, some people can still think of other concepts- like God, their cat, the world, the universe, etc. BUT. Since 'self-mode' is deactivated, there is this sense of oneness with all of it. (Sound familiar? Like, when you think of spirituality in general?) Hmmmm.   Here's some street cred: my aunt has Epilepsy, and she's shared some of her experiences with me. Additionally, the 7th Day Adventists- founded by Ellen White- are based on ""visions and prophesies"" she had/experienced while having tonic-clonic seizures. Some are even bold enough to suggest that many of the visions documented in the Bible were simply the aftermath of seizures, narrated within the [at the time] current cultural context. I personally take issue with that, but that is a separate conversation.  And so. Back to neurotheology. The philosophical problem we face- whether we are discussing seizures, hallucinogenic 'trips,' meditation, or whatnot, is this: do these occurrences simply tap into the part of the brain where ""God lives,"" or do they actually open the door to a higher awareness, wherein it becomes easier to connect with otherness? Is Self somewhat of an illusion after all, held in place by neural synapses, and made tangible by the physical bodies we temporarily possess? Do we truly possess a ""third eye,"" as it's called in the yogic traditions of the chakras, and we've simply begun to understand the actual science behind how to access it?  OR. It's just a bunch of BS, like most acid trips, near-death experiences, and intense spiritual awakenings are generally considered to be. ""It's all in your head. HERE- I can prove it by pointing out the parts of your brain responsible for generating these illusions."" WHICH ONE IS AN ILLUSION??  I digress. Let me make this relevant to your experience. :) If you did indeed 'tap into' some sort of otherness during your dream, it may have stimulated that ""door of perception"" in your own brain. Perhaps that caused the seizure. Perhaps the dream itself was the result of a [smaller] seizure. Still doesn't explain how you and your buddy had the SAME freakin' dream. That's just creepy right there. But my point is, you could very well be correct that the spooky dream experience- and the subsequent seizure- are related. Perhaps they both took place in that same weird nook of your brain, where Self gets hazy and Other slides in through they key-hole. :)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,snoop911,6,Sun May 17 02:24:51 2015 UTC,"Oh hell yeah, got me some info :P First off, Aldous Huxley, FAVORITE AUTHOR. Doors of perception, perennial philosophy, brave new world, the island, oh yesssss. But alas, I am as non-religious as they come, and am a tad solipsistic tbh.. My apathy is so bad I was diagnosed with psychopathy. I honestly don't know what would happen if that switch was flipped. Btw, the third eye is the peneal gland. I'm sure you know that, referencing Huxley and whatnot, but it sounds like you're referencing something else.. Also, that was the only time I've had a seizure, and I don't even know if that is what it really was. Just woke up with my body in a crazy fit."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,thefatticuscat,5,Sun May 17 03:26:57 2015 UTC,"LOL, ""psychopath"" isn't a legit diagnosis anymore. Perhaps you were diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder? If so, that's interesting, because personality disorders are generally linked to some sort of deep-seeded trauma.   Anyway, I've not heard of the pineal gland referred to as the Third Eye; I must look into this. It's honestly been over 12 years since I took that course, so I'm rusty on details. But I do vaguely recall that multiple parts of the brain were discussed (which, I may have alluded otherwise in my novella I sent you). One must bear in mind that our brains do internal cross-referencing in order to fully analyze data. For something as complex as a spiritual experience (which even atheists can have, if you're willing to be loose with the semantics), the overall experience is probably bounced around a bit....but with a ""home base"" (pineal gland? shrug) as the ultimate determinant for what to make of the whole thing.    Anyhow, I'm glad you found my loquacious monologue somewhat interesting. :)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,thefatticuscat,6,Sun May 17 03:35:46 2015 UTC,"I've been to so many doctors, been diagnosed with so many things. I've been legit diagnosed with about 10 mental illnesses. I actually just typed them out but kinda figured you don't need to know all that lol.   Opening of the third eye is the opening of the peneal glad, which contains DMT that is released straight into your surrounding tissues when your body dies (or if you meditate it out, whichever). In my personal belief, that's what accounts for pretty much all NDE visions and whatnot..  It's always fun to find someone who can keep not only keep up, but add to conversations like yourself."

Once lucid if you look at your hands and it does not work, walk around until you find a door with light coming from under it. open it and you get the same result as #1.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,VeniVidiIvi,43,Sat May 16 19:37:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, for the sake of discussion -  First let me say that I do believe shared dreams and spooky things can happen, so I'm not discounting your story. But let me list the items that make me question the story as written. I hope you take this in stride. I'm not criticizing you, just aspects of the story. :)   one of the most creepy things I've ever experienced   Hyperbole to set up expectation in reader.   She was my age (16 at the time), about 5'4"", straight shoulder length blonde hair, blue eyes, gray hoodie, tight fitting blue jeans, and black converse.   Very specific, yet mundane description that establishes a concrete entity mixing the creepy and everyday. Somewhat like Slender Man or Stephen King's ""It"". I may be completely wrong about this, but it also doesn't ""sound"" like dream imagery to me. More like descriptive fiction.   She started to ask me what felt like overly intrusive questions about my life that all seemed to be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"", all without ever actually moving her mouth.   This is like the silent stranger on a lonely rode ghost archetype.   I hear my friend underneath me talking to himself, with about 4 seconds between every word. ""Yes. Yes. No. Sometimes. Yes. No. No."". My heart stopped.    This is the literary turn in creepy pasta where the strange crosses over into the material world and becomes ""supernatural"". Like in the ""Ring"" when the creepy video actually steps into the real world. Also, ""My heart stopped."" sounds like liteary cliche to me.   I had no answer. I still have no answer. I swear on everything I know and love that this happened.   This is the creepy pasta kicker where the writer ""swears"" that everything is true. It's a little too much I think. People who experience glitches are usually unsure of what happened themselves so are not so likely to swear so readily. OR the experience seemed so real that the question of ""swearing"" on it is not an issue for them.  And please, this is just my offhand opinion. I'm just one of many others on here, so just ignore me if I'm wrong about this."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,VeniVidiIvi,15,Sat May 16 21:16:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like your approach (not commenting on OP here). One thing I've noticed over the last 5 years in particular, though, is that people are increasingly writing and talking in ""fictionspeak"" generally.  I think it's the same movement that has everyday people critic-watching films, talking about ""plot-twists"" and ""closure"" and ""character arcs"" - seeing the film-making instead of the film - or experiencing things in the ""fairground ride"" filter. There's an extra layer of self-consciousness and ""presentation"" involved now.  The Internet generally and sites like reddit more specifically are the seed of all this, I think.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,Troybylt,11,Sat May 16 22:32:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well, my thinking is that there are going to be hoax posts especially in a sub like this. And hoax posts detract from the integrity of this sub in general. There are supposed to be real-life stories in here, and fictional tales, while entertaining, confuse the narrative.  I feel like it's best to say if you feel something is not quite right. The OP can respond and address the issues, and maybe clear up any misunderstandings. Open discussion is good for everyone.  And I'm not trying to ""discredit"" exactly. I'm just saying why it sounds like fiction to me - and only to me.  This does open a more general question concerning this sub. How are we supposed to handle posts we think are fictitious? Do we ignore them - try to believe everything - or speak up when we think something is fishy?  Whatever the established etiquette becomes, I'll be happy to follow it.  EDIT: I just saw the OP's reply to my critique, and he/she had a good response to the issues I had with the story. See the reply up top somewhere. :)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,Troybylt,9,Sun May 17 03:00:40 2015 UTC,"Same here. I have a hard time believing this.   The part that bothers me the most is that the OP basically force fed their friend all of the details of his dream within seconds of him waking up. If OP had asked the friend what he saw in his dream and then his friend gave him all the right details, it'd be one thing. But he didn't. Instead OP woke his friend up and while his friend was still half awake and open to suggestion, he planted the idea of the girl. OP even described the girl to his friend so the friend would know what she looked like.   That part just doesn't fly with me. Had the friend come to the same conclusion separately it'd be one thing. But even so, even if all of this is true, it sure sounds like the OP basically planted the idea in his friend's head. The entire thing reads like someone who wants this to be true and is manipulating the situation to make it seem true, both by planting the idea in his friend's head and then writing out this creepypasta-esque explanation for us.  Worst of all is the whole ""I just made this account because I had to share this story"" followed directly by ""this happened five years ago."" To me that's kind of a telling detail. The fact that a throwaway account was needed to tell this basic story, the idea that the OP had to make the account just to tell the story but the story happened five freaking years ago-- it just reeks of creepypasta. It reeks of ""I just thought up this story and had to share it with you."" I'm not convinced."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,TwoPlacesAtOnce,9,Sat May 16 22:16:46 2015 UTC,Awesome story. I have a few questions. What kind of questions did she ask? How did you know she wasn't a dream character? Did your friend tell you what happened after she finished asking him the questions?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,NurseNikky,11,Sun May 17 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"I think one of the questions was if my parents still loved each other. I cant remember the questions very well. Think it may have had to do with her mouth not moving.. It was more like I just understood what she was implying than her actually speaking, but with no loss of communication.  I became lucid. There wasn't one specific thing that made me realize I wasn't dreaming her into existence (as far as i can remember), apart from just feeling super uncomfortable answering her questions. Everything just felt wrong and I had an overwhelming need to get away from her.   No, he didn't. He didn't remember the dream leading to them walking down the road, and I woke him right after she had finished questioning him. Honestly, he didn't help me figure anything and couldn't tell me anything that didn't happen in my dream as well."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,NurseNikky,6,Sun May 17 12:24:18 2015 UTC,"Now, the tough part ;-) What was she asking you, and what were your answers? I think this has bearing on this occurrence.  Same for your friend, what was she asking him?  I think it also has pertinence that you have very realistic and sadistic dreams.  Can you tell us one of two?  Not sure where I'm going with this, but there's a lot of things that have no explanation for yet, but there's definitely more than we currently know."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,366hl5,ParadisaeaDecora,12,Sun May 17 14:21:21 2015 UTC,"The only question i really remember was ""Do your parents still love each other"" which is a no lol. He and i never got deep into what she asked us, and I got out of there pretty fast tbh.   Well, one dream involved me being stuck on a dead end street, with every house I entered filled with different groups of friends and family killed and brutally mutilated then positioned as if they were celebrating a holiday. Different dead people and a different holiday in each house. I ended up beating the demon who did it to death with an aluminum baseball bat while laughing.....  Another dream was based in my previous college. I was walking with a couple friends by a picnic table, when we saw deer running all around campus. For some reason we were wary of them, so we split up to go to our respective dorms. I didn't think too much about them till I went in the main building and turned around to see a deer standing right outside the sliding glass door. I then noticed the deer had a broken leg, several ribs sticking out, matted with blood, and missing half of its face. It suddenly started shooting blood from every orifice of it's body while slamming it's head against the glass. Then it just stopped. It looked me in the eye and and said in a guttural voice, ""Please let me in. I love you. I love you. Why wont you love me? Please. I love you."" then went back to smashing it's head against the glass and getting blood everywhere. I then turned around and left it there.  Oh, also, I can't pull myself out of dreams that I feel pain in. Rather not go into detail about dreams of being tortured."

I'm a very light sleeper and more or less each time I wake up and fall back asleep I enter a new dream, so there's quite a range, not all are bad, lots of recurring themes, rather than specifics. I wouldn't say my childhood was traumatic, but the dreams reached a whole new level of terrifying when I was depressed in high school and have never really been as bad since."

I seen it described as; You move into a house that seems to have ghosts. YOu sometimes see a couple doing normal things and hear them either arguing or laughing (generally something emotional, good or bad) then disappearing.  Later you stopped by a yard sale and see the couple alive and well. They're not dead, they just moved out. But for some odd reason they have left a recording of them selves behind.  Mostly people say it has something to do with strong emotion leaving an imprint. But personally I find the more lost you are in a day dream (Theta brain wave mode), the more really strange stuff happens.  But, of course, this doesn't explain anything if it was actually the friend pulling into the driveway in a time shift.    I don't know. This is a good one"

I was in my house one day alone, completely alone as my dad had gone to work, no pets or anyone else around, and my mom doesnt live with me. I was sitting in my room on the computer with the door closed, and I suddenly heard the side door to my house slam shut, I was curious as to why because my dad never slams the door even when hes angry.   I walked out of my room to the door and found that not only was it shut, but locked. I had locked it when my dad left but I know for sure it was that door that was slammed, ive heard it a few times before. I walked out the door to see if there was the neighbors fighting or something, but no one was around outside, and even if they were, it couldnt have been them because their house is by the side door, and my room is at the total opposite side of the house from that door.   My dad hadnt come home or anything yet either, I was confused but I quickly brushed it off. Your post made me think of it again."

I wish I knew exactly how to always be in that state of mind around boiling water!

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,365vw5,Neo_Oli,3,Wed May 20 14:17:33 2015 UTC,Let me see if I have this straight.  1. You were playing a game with your controller plugged in. 2. You unplugged the controller in order to charge your phone. 3. You realized you could not use the controller anymore because it was not plugged in.  Is that right?  I think you might have forgotten to mention the part where something unexpected happened.  EDIT: Sometimes reading comprehension is not my strong suit.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,365vw5,UniversalChairs,4,Sat May 16 14:32:16 2015 UTC,The unexpected is that When I was going to plug the phone I noticed that the Controller wasn't plugged the entire time.and when I noticed this the controller stopped working.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,365vw5,Plopoholic,1 point,Sat May 16 21:59:48 2015 UTC,"The only logical explanation is you had a Brain fart.  You were thinking of charging your phone and were so deep in thought during your game you unconsciously unplugged your controller usb thinking it was the usb cord for the phone,  suddenly you subconsciously realised it wasn't,  stopped, then looked for the usb cord for the phone and noticed your controller was unplugged,  not remembering you unplugged it in the first place. I do this sometimes,  I'm so impatient in completing a task I skip a couple of steps ahead and afterwards am confused at where I am.  This happened more when I was younger when I was eager to get things done quickly. Also you can do things automatically without realising your doing it and not remembering afterwards.  For example, I daydream in the shower while I wash my hair.  When my daydream ends I can't remember if I washed my hair.  So I wash it again,  this time it feels familiar,  like déjà vu.  Did I wash my hair before?  The mind can play funny tricks on you when your not concentrating.  That is why,  I try to be fully aware 100%, since then,  I haven't had a glitch in years. Oh,  and trust me, a unplugged controller won't work on its own, Microsoft ain't that kind."

Then we will hear words that were of a completely unrecognizable language, being said in a very deep breathy, grunty manner with a digitized static sound in the background.  The language sounded sort of like ""speaking in tongues.""    The only thing we will be able to distinguish is our names, which is said very slowly and softly.  Though, none of us can replicate the way that it sounds, it is impossible to replicate with our vocal chords.  It sounds so alien to us, the first time it happened I got chills up my spine and must've looked ghost white.  Then, the phone would ""beep"" a few times and it would say ""call failed.""  I called him back and we were both just silent, and he said, ""What.  The.  Fuck.  Was.  That.""

The location and timestamp info is stored in the image meta-data. I actually encountered a similar situation last night when I saved an image from a Google Image Search to my Camera Roll. I went to look for it to send in a text message, but couldn't find it right away. All of my images are organized by date, but instead of being the most recent image at the end, it was at the very beginning of my Camera Roll -- showing a 2012 date, years before I had this phone.   Even though the file is new and the date stamp would read as recent, iOS defaults to the meta-data first if it exists. You can also organize by location in iOS, which is also determined by this meta-data. This would absolutely cause that image to show in a location you have never been.   The real question is how it got on your phone if you don't remember saving it, but those possibilities are pretty endless and far from paranormal. This is the reason that possible technology ""glitches"" should be banned in this sub. It's basically the same as spreading ignorant superstition, which is detrimental to the knowledge of mankind and kills the hope for those of us longing to read about ""real"" (actually unexplainable) glitches, which are becoming quite a rare find these days.

It was a motorcycle accident. We were on a road trip from so cal--friends uncle had died and we were going to funeral in Corvalis.  I had never head of Mt. Shasta. It was I-5, middle of the night when I hit a burm in the middle of the freeway.nthey pave one side and not the other and there were no signs. So I hit a curb in the middle of h freeway after we got back on looking for vacant motels in Weed, Ca.  Ended up getting a very nice settlement (think, brand new M3) from Cal Trans. Anyway, head hit the pavement and I was gone.  Still can not put into words what I saw. But my buddy found me convulsing on the side of the freeway. Yes rolles back.  Woke up in the hospital. Mt Shasta Memorial. High on morphine. Because of what I saw I thoguht I was dead. I was dead. I had chosen to come back and live this life. The nurse asked me why the Lemurians had made m crash on their mountain. I asked what she meant. She took me outside. Go look at a pic of the mt. It is a free standing 14k extinct volcano. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I asked if we were in heaven and she laughed and said, no, just Mt Shasta California.  Please, visit the mountain. There is something so odd, so surreal about the place. Tons of legends about the mountain, the Native Americans also felt the mountain was sacred.   You can not drive up the mountain. You can go as high as 7500 feet. There is a camp ground there called Panther Gardens or Meadows.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,362wbv,krishnakanthreadsit,8,Fri May 15 17:18:18 2015 UTC,"Well, the subreddit itself has lots of different phenomena - but they can all be captured in the idea that ""everyday reality behaved differently to how you expected"".  There's a mistake that people make, which is to assume that giving something a name or a category explains the thing (e.g. Time Distortion Syndrome or Baader-Meinhoff or AIWS), but if you can't then say how exactly that works, it's not an explanation at all. It's just a name. The Syndrome Syndrome!   Everything in this subreddit could be put under the heading ""Glitchy Experience Syndrome"" and we could stop talking about it. :-)  Actually, the real problem with naming something is that the definition usually accounts for only some of the observations, and yet it tends to stop further thinking and investigation. (For instance, Baader-Meinhoff does not easily explain many of the aspects of strong synchronicity, which seems to have an event-selection component.)   So while oftentimes all we really have is loose categorisation and some metaphysical theorising (sort of ""as if"" thinking that connects the dots), there is plenty of exploring and explanation to come. Which means they can't yet be separated into ""effects' yet.  Broad categories:   Objects disappear and reappearing. Hearing or seeing people who aren't there; there being an apparent duplicate of someone. Near-death experiences involving ""time resets"" and after-affects Whole lives lived which people then wake up from. The world ""shifting"" such that certain facts have changed, personally or in the world at large. Apparently knowing things one shouldn't, either directly or by spontaneous action. Traveling to places which later cannot be found again. Spatial and temporal distortion effects more generally. Numerous perceptual quirks, some well known others rare, hard to pin down usually.   Some posts which highlight discussion, slightly biased: (read through the comments)   Our everyday perception doesn't work how we assume An extreme synchronicity situation An attempt to describe the world as a simulation Discussing theories behind teleporting objects Being careful about using QM explanations   TL;DR: There are loose categories of types of experience, but since most explanations amount to ""naming"" rather than ""explaining"", it's not easily to group these into effects."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,362wbv,michikade,2,Sat May 16 02:17:11 2015 UTC,"Depends on who you ask.  Some people believe that quantum suicide / quantum immortality is the causative factor.  Some people claim the glitches / Mandela Effects only occur after a 'near death experience' where they actually died and just shifted into this universe where things are just ever-so-slightly different.  Some people's glitches are much more easily explained by things like sleep paralysis, depersonalisation, disassociation, etc.  There's a slew of explanations that have to do with something physically or mentally occurring for the person rather than something occurring in the world around them.  Before when the term was coined a few years ago, the 'Mandela Effect' was simply called false memories.  False memories could be a true effect of some sort of glitch or simply as they're called - time and age can change the truly fallible human memory, which can be tricked into remembering something one way regardless of whether it happened or not based on suggestion alone.  If someone tells me they remember something specific from when they were a small child 20+ years ago, I'm going to look for an alternate explanation.  Kinda like why in this sub it's against the rules to post 'when I was a kid' stories."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,362wbv,fwau,1 point,Fri May 15 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"Are you asking what causes glitches? If we knew that then they wouldn't be called ""glitches,"" they would just be called normal, natural phenomena."

It's a theory that mixes physics and Buddhism positing that separation is an illusion. We are all one consciousness, like a body with individual cells. Each cell is aware of everything going on with the other cells. Any individual can access information about another other part of the body. But most of us are too wrapped up in ourselves to do it."

It could be that we spread our body-information to other beings all the time; be it through breathed air, skin cells, moisture, etc.  A bit different from nonlocality, but another thought on how beings could be ""connected"" on more ways than we think yet."

Delicate topic, correcting someone on their use of miscarriage and stillborn isn't a very cool thing to do. If they experienced it, you'd think they'd know that.   That said, miscarriage is used for when the fetus is not able to survive on its own outside of the womb. Stillbirth is used for when the fetus could survive outside of the mother's body, if everything was in working order."

I'm guessing with ppl becoming more aware in the Information Age. It's hard to explain but whoever is saying things is accessing something higher or lower to influence you. People having full blown conversation and nothing is remembered the next day but influence you In a decision in the future. Majority of ppl do this On a subtle level but there are powerful moments I don't think you were suppose to remember and just let it be unless it's really negative. For example you said something to someone that you just couldn't  stop from saying and you'll forget it the next moment.

I'm sure I've had this before, but it's very much possible that it was an import product from Canada and I never knew.   Also-- it looks like 7-Up came out with a Pomegranate flavor recently, which could have also been confused for cranberry. My guess though is that your area got the imported 7-Up when it was a thing, but I think they've since discontinued it."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35v9id,owwmyass,7,Wed May 13 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia on the cholinergic system: Further studies on the cholinergic system and AD demonstrated acetylcholine plays a role in learning and memory. Scopolamine, an anticholinergic drug, was used to block cholinergic activity in young adults and induce memory impairments similar to those present in the elderly. The memory impairments were reversed when treated with physostigmine, a cholinergic agonist. However, reversing memory impairments in AD patients may not be this easy due to permanent changes in brain structure.[5]  When young adults perform memory and attention tasks, brain activation patterns are balanced between the frontal and occipital lobes, creating a balance between bottom-up and top-down processing. Normal cognitive aging may affect long term and working memory, though the cholinergic system and cortical areas maintain performance through functional compensation. Adults with AD presenting with dysfunction of the cholinergic system are not able to compensate for long-term and working memory deficits.[6]  AD is currently treated by increasing acetylcholine concentration by using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to inhibit acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine. Current acetylcholinesterase inhibitors approved in the United States by the FDA to treat Alzheimer’s include Aricept, Exelon, and Reminyl. These drugs work to increase the levels of acetylcholine and subsequently increase the function of neural cells.[7] However, not all treatments based upon the cholinergic hypothesis have been successful in treating the symptoms or slowing the progression of AD.[8] Therefore, a disruption to the cholinergic system has been proposed as a consequence of AD rather than a direct cause.  If elevated cholines (from the egg yolk) can possibly affect memory and learning, it just may be a glitch I had...in my brain.  Am I grasping for straws? Maybe...I'm firmly based in logic so this episode has really thrown me for a loop."

Is anything happening in your life, are things changing a lot in other areas, is this a transitional phase? Also -    Nobody else notices this when asked, except for those 2-3 people who look the same.   How do you ask people in general and what do they say?

The report abstract states:   ABSTRACT  This study was tasked with the purpose of collecting information describing the teleportation of material objects, providing a description of teleportation as it occurs in physics, its theoretical and experimental status, and a projection of potential applications. The study also consisted of a search for teleportation phenomena occurring naturally or under laboratory conditions that can be assembled into a model describing the conditions required to accomplish the transfer of objects. This included a review and documentation of quantum teleportation, its theoretical basis, technological development, and its potential applications. The characteristics of teleportation were defined and physical theories were evaluated in terms of their ability to completely describe the phenomena. Contemporary physics, as well as theories that presently challenge the current physics paradigm were investigated. The author identified and proposed two unique physics models for teleportation that are based on the manipulation of either the general relativistic spacetime metric or the spacetime vacuum electromagnetic (zero-point fluctuations) parameters. Naturally occurring anomalous teleportation phenomena that were previously studied by the United States and foreign governments were also documented in the study and are reviewed in the report. The author proposes an additional model for teleportation that is based on a combination of the experimental results from the previous government studies and advanced physics concepts. Numerous recommendations outlining proposals for further theoretical and experimental studies are given in the report. The report also includes an extensive teleportation bibliography.  August 2004 Special Report AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE CA 93524-7048   You can find out more about Eric Davis here:   Eric is currently employed as a Senior Research Physicist at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin. He is also the CEO/Chief Scientist of Warp Drive Metrics, and has provided contract services to the Air Force Research Laboratory, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts. He was also a technical contributor and consultant to the NASA Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program.   His non-theory theory is on page 60 of the report. Essentially he ""explains"" it as (my emphasis):   ...a human consciousness phenomenon that somehow acts to move or rotate test specimens through a 4th spatial dimension, so that the specimens are able to penetrate the solid walls/barriers of their containers without physically breaching them.   It provides some nice imagery though:   Another property of higher dimensional geometry (Reichenbach, 1957; Rucker, 1977, 1984) is that one can move through solid three-dimensional obstacles without penetrating them by passing in the direction of the 4th (spatial) dimension. The 4th dimension is perpendicular to all of our normal three-dimensional space directions, and so our three-dimensional enclosures have no walls against this direction.   So the idea is that (somehow!) you take an object that's in a particular location, you diffuse it across 4D (time), before then refocussing it back into 3D in another location."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,TriumphantGeorge,2,Wed May 13 11:11:13 2015 UTC,"you diffuse it across 4D (time),    That's what I understand as well, but why does he specifically say ""in the direction of the 4th (spatial) dimension""?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,paremiamoutza,5,Wed May 13 12:01:11 2015 UTC,"You mean, why does he say ""spatial""? Because that's how it is conceived of  in terms of unfolding experience [misleading vs the paper, see EDIT later for clarification]. How I might imagine this:  Life as 4D Environment  Our experience is like that of sitting in a 4-dimensional room, but only looking at one region or '3D slice' at a time. Our attention is gradually scanning from one end of the room to the other. To us it seems as though objects appear, change, disappear, but really we are seeing cross-sections of static objects laid out across the room. (e.g. A cone would appear as a dot which expands into wider and wider circles before disappearing completely.)  Teleportation is an experience you have when an object you've already seen is moved along the direction of scanning - so that you encounter it again in time. A bit like how Nathan Fillion appears in multiple places at once in this silly scene from Firefly.  Teleportation as Unfolding Experience  So, the experience of teleportation isn't spatial really. It's about locations in time rather than locations in space. As an unfolding of experience as moments from your 1st person perspective, looking through your own eyes:  Moment 1: Seeing an object on the table Moment 2: Seeing an empty table Moment 3: Seeing a door getting closer Moment 4: Seeing the doorframe pass Moment 5: Seeing another room envelop me Moment 6: Seeing another table, with the object on it  The object was moved in time such that later on our ""scanning of the 4D environment"" encountered it again.  [EDIT for clarity: In other words, the teleporter is instantaneously creating a pattern across 4-dimensional space. The observers subsequently encounter that pattern as an unfolding experience in time.]  Implications?  If teleportation was possible in this way, then it would suggest something interesting. It would suggest that all our actions are 4-dimensional, and it's just our sensory experience that is constrained to 3-dimensions (scanning the 4th). Whether that constraint is a genuine limitation or simply a matter of habit, is something that could then be debated."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,TriumphantGeorge,2,Wed May 13 20:04:24 2015 UTC,"They have different functions. An object can have an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions, ie its shape. If that shape changes from one moment to another, that change is a temporal dimension.  The passage of time can be viewed as an additional dimension; for example the movement of pieces on a chessboard can be seen as a grid of static chessboards, and ""time"" merely the selection of which chessboard we are looking at. Because each chessboard gives rise to multiple possible outcomes, ""time"" can be multidimensional.  There is nothing inherent to a fourth dimension that makes it a temporal dimension. 4D objects can change through time, and from the perspective of a 4D object, time would be seen as the fifth dimension (and alternative timelines as the sixth and higher)."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,aeschenkarnos,3,Wed May 13 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"There is nothing inherent to a fourth dimension that makes it a temporal dimension.    Right. I don't think you are actually disagreeing with me. It's a matter of perspective.  Any dynamic pattern described by [x spatial dimensions + time] can be described from a higher perspective as a static pattern of [x+1 spatial dimensions].  In the metaphor, I stick to 4 dimensions because that's all we ever directly experience (any others are diagrammatic conveniences):   From the perspective of the observers, the situation is experienced as [3D pattern + time]. In other words, 3D moments unfolding as time passes. From the perspective of the teleporter's action, the situation is experienced as an updating of  [4D static pattern]. In other words, 3D moments all laid out. The 4th dimension is temporal from the perspective of an observer, it is spatial from the higher perspective of the teleportation act. Teleportation changes the ""4D pattern"" which we call an object ""out of time"" (or if you prefer, in time as viewed from a higher dimension, because ""change"" occurs at that higher level - 5th dimension.)   In other words, I am suggesting that our ongoing experience is like that of your attention scanning across a 4D static object, which a teleporter can update from the next level up.  TL;DR: One perspective's temporal dimension is another perspective's spatial dimension."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,TriumphantGeorge,2,Wed May 13 20:27:59 2015 UTC,"Allow me to chime in because I have a view that possibly straddles both of yours (in a completely platonic manner). TG is working with a ""timeless"" model where any and all changes in an object/world are designated in the overall extant pattern. It's only our narrowed perception that makes it seems like stuff is changing - like flipping through a flip book - the images are static but it is our shifting perception that creates the illusion of movement/time.  I'm cool with that view, but I also place some attention on the possibility that there is a ""master"" time dimension that exists independent of the 4D construct of the physical world. I have a few reasons for wondering about this, but I won't get into it here. This is closer to what aeschenkarnos is saying, I believe."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,Scroon,1 point,Thu May 14 03:08:28 2015 UTC,"Indeed this is what I am saying. In any reality of any spatial dimensionality there would need to be at least one temporal dimension as well, for that reality to be ""usable"", for want of a better word."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,aeschenkarnos,2,Thu May 14 05:23:18 2015 UTC,"Just following this line of reasoning, isn't it interesting to suppose why ""time"" seems to be necessary for ""usability"". I guess it has to do with the idea of change. Change in spatiality is equivalent to time and vice versa. To say there is no time is to also say that there is no change.  Now, falling a bit more back in line with TG's view, if you could look at a simplistic model of a 4D timeline all at once, there would be no change or sense of time. You could however limit your view to sections of the 4D timeline, and this would produce apparent change to the viewer. Resulting in a sense of ""time"".  Confoundingly (for me), however, the idea of limiting your view to a progressive sequence presupposes the idea of an overarching time dimension through which to apportion your view.  Maybe ultimately there is no ""time"" as we conceive it, but merely change. Things becoming other things, and this is a unique property of ultimate existence. Or perhaps ""becoming"" is the true singular nature of reality, and ""things"" and ""time"" are merely byproducts.  And these are the thoughts one has at 1AM when you can't sleep."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,Scroon,1 point,Thu May 14 08:13:39 2015 UTC,"Nice.  Just to chime-chime in - yes, if you were an object then the ""dimension you stand on"" would always be a time dimension. However, this is where we get into consciousness and 'what you are'.   Without any preamble or justification, say:  You are yourself dimensionless, a perspective and not an object; you are the subject. You can't be conceived of or even experienced. You might think of yourself as literally ""attention"". But when we think of ""attention"" we tend to think of a torchlight focusing on parts of a structure, and this implies a movement and a physicality. Really it's more like a filter which allows certain aspects of the whole into sensory experience. It has no physicality or location. Dimensionality is part of the the filtering, not inherent to the universe, just like objects themselves.   Time itself is the name we give to change. We say that time passes, but really we mean that experience changes. Each moment of experience is timeless. There is no ""duration"" of a moment. If you think you are a ""thing that moves"", this is a problem. You will always need another dimension in which ""the movement between moments of movement"" happens. In actual experience, it is not like this. However, we can't conceive of it, because that requires us to imagine an ""object"" which does the experiencing - at which point we are immediately incorrect.  As you see, this all starts to sound mystical pretty quickly - and we get into the whole distinction between thinking-about something and actual knowing-experiencing - however if you investigate your own direct experience you'll find it matches.  (You can see why I tried to skip that bit.)"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,stunspot,3,Wed May 13 14:16:29 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's a good point to emphasise.   I included ""(time)"" to make it easier to understand - because 4D traversal is time for humans - but strictly speaking time is change and so isn't associated with a particular dimension independent of an observer.  It's probably more accurate still to say that the universe itself is non-dimensional - it's just a bunch of ""facts"". However,  our perception and therefore our conceptualisation organises them into dimensions (depending a little on your philosophical preferences).   The salient element here is that space and time, rather than being real things-in-themselves or empirically mediated appearances (German: Erscheinungen), are the very forms of intuition (German: Anschauung) by which we must perceive objects.  -- Wikipedia entry on Immanuel Kant's Transcendental Idealism"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,TriumphantGeorge,6,Wed May 13 14:27:16 2015 UTC,"No, you seem be misunderstanding.

This paper is speculating about rotation through a 4th spatial dimension. Time simply has nothing to do with this discussion, regardless of your conception of it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,stunspot,6,Wed May 13 14:32:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do understand. But I was trying to provide an intuitive connection between the description of the action and the world as we subsequently experience it, perhaps confusingly.  [EDIT: Note, I'm talking about ""p-Teleportation"" here, which is performed  on an object by a person unaided. I think we can't talk about that without connecting the act to the experience as it appears to unfold in time. My attempt below is probably isn't very clear, alas.]  What he's saying is that teleportation can in effect be described as a translation/diffusion across a higher-dimensional configuration space such that  (x1, y1, z1) becomes (x2, y2, x2). It's not really an explanation yet though, since it doesn't connect to action or observation. In particular, I'm not sure it accounts for examples where the object disappeared for a while, and then materialised some time later, without additional action from the teleporter.  This suggests that the teleport action might be better described as defining a sequence of events - in the form of a pattern,  created at that moment,  across 4D space -  which the observers subsequently encounter.  It's in this sense that I'm equating the 4D used for the action (the ""direction"" that the pattern was created along in configuration space) and the 4D of time (the subsequent experiences of the human observers in time)."

That's why the author talks about the fourth spatial dimension, it clearly states this is not using time as a dimention but space.   Imagine a stick figurine with an apple in front of him and a wall (made of glass) behind the apple. Suppose the wall is transparent.   Now comes this other stick figurine saying: I can do things you can't because I can access more dimensions than the two we live in. Stick figurine one laughs in the face of the other one.   So stick figurine two pushes the apple outside so it's not sitting on the sheet of paper where the figurines are drawn. The apple now ''outside'' the sheet of paper can be pushed right further than the wall. Stick figurine two then brings back the apple to the level of the sheet of paper.   HOLY SHIT, the apple is now behind the glass says the first stick figurine. That's impossible, you made the apple go trough a solid pane of (2D) glass!   In reality the apple never went ''trough'' the glass, it used ''thickness'' dimension to go to a place where there was no glass and then moved asside and was brought back in the 2D projections that our stick figurine are seeing.   In this case, they are saying that (at least one) more space dimensions exists and that some people have the power to move objects in that dimension so that when brought back to our 3D projection of 4D (or more) dimensions, the objects has gone trough a wall.  The keyword here is that we're 3D projections in a 4 or more spatial dimension space. The problem I see with this theory is that we still need to move the object remotly. If we can't more the object in our 3D world without touching it then how can we move it in a ''4D'' world ? It makes no sense to me and either something is missing in that data or a more toughtfully explained idea needs to be figured out. Something that would allow telekinesis in 3D space too."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,TriumphantGeorge,5,Wed May 13 09:17:36 2015 UTC,"Good summary of how it's described in the paper! I think it doesn't really work as an explanation for the effect, just as you suggest. Moving something 3D, ""outside"" 3D?  That's why I was thinking it makes more sense to say that an object isn't a thing, but is instead a higher-dimensional extended pattern. We can then think of an object as a pattern spread out across a spacetime 4D landscape, which you and I experience one 3D 'slice' per moment.   This means the teleporter doesn't really move the object through walls at all, they modify its pattern across that 4D landscape.   In this explanation the 4th dimension corresponds to a spatial dimension (for the pattern) which is also a temporal dimension (experienced by humans as ""time""). It ties together the change made by the teleporter and our subsequent experience of the object being in a different place.  That's what I tried to describe in my comments earlier, but I think I may have confused more than illuminated.  EDIT: The reason for this approach perhaps being appealing is that it could also be used for describing other PK effects. Even just having a ""patterns across a time landscape"" concept is very helpful.  I should say that I think string theory is a complete hack job in its introduction and handling of arbitrary ""dimensions"", so I'm sticking to the four subjectively perceivable ones. In the end, I suspect it is our minds which have dimensional formatting, not the universe. (See George Ellis's good Nature article from last year on string theory & friends.)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,asaasa1983,1 point,Wed May 13 18:08:17 2015 UTC,"I think string theory is not well understood by everyone outside of it, including physicists that are not working on it. I dare say that because I am a physicist and I tried really hard to grasp everything but everytime I seem to assume things that are either not there or are more complex than I imagined it.   What I would like to see is how the objects are moved from one place to the other. Does the object completly disappears, wait a bit then appear at another place: this would make movement in higher dimensions possible. Or are the objects disappearing from one place and immediatly appearing at the second place. In this case it would make moving the object in another dimension impossible since it would still take time to move the object along it's 3D projection in a different fourth (or higher) dimension. For example, the apple in my first example can't ''rise up'' in 3D and be moved to the new position and returned to it's projection instantanuously. Maybe it can happen really fast but not infinitly fast.   All in all, I still think something's fishy in this experiment. Like I said, if you can use fourth or higher space dimensions, you still need to displace the object in the 3 dimensions we know and see. So if you can't move the object from one side of a table to the other than you can't move it across a wall. Unless their explanation is that we only see the 3D projection of the object and the telekinesis happens because people are able to influence higher dimensions and not the ''regular'' ones. But this is really far-fetched."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,TriumphantGeorge,3,Wed May 13 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"I think string theory is not well understood by everyone outside of it...   Agreed on string theory. My issue with it is that it brings to mind 'serial universe' theories of the early 20th century. They are really mathematical-philosophical constructs rather than scientific, testable theories. There are useful ways of thinking though, but their connection to actual observations becomes pretty remote.   What I would like to see is how the objects are moved from one place to the other.    Yes, this is an important area. It's not necessarily true that the change can't happen semi-instantly, though - if it's happening from a higher-dimensional perspective, then it's not our time that it's unfolding in. Even the word ""happening"" might not be a very good description.   But it depends on the nature of the change, which isn't clear at all from the experiment.   All in all, I still think something's fishy in this experiment.   Yes, maybe. There may be a difference between moving an apple (like levitating it) and changing its location (teleporting it). The latter might more be like updating the co-ordinates from (x1, y1, z1) to (x2, y2, z2) by focusing on the target location.  Again, it depends on the nature of the change. How were the teleporters going about this, as perceived in their own minds? Were they ""moving the object"" or were they ""editing facts of the universe""?   Unless their explanation is that we only see the 3D projection of the object and the telekinesis happens because people are able to influence higher dimensions and not the ''regular'' ones. But this is really far-fetched.   It might be the most efficient explanation.  Simply because we only experience a 3D sensory environment, doesn't mean our intentions don't apply 4-dimensionally, say. In fact, if we decide to raise our arm, might that be described as created a pattern across 4-dimensions which we subsequently experience in 3D 'sensory slices'?  The problem with this area is that we inevitably get into philosophy and metaphysics - where it becomes about painting a picture that joins the dots, but which can never be tested in its details. This is basically what string theory does.  I think the phrase ""far-fetched"" has to be put aside when discussing this sort of thing! :-)"

I don't think anyone is. :-) All we can really do is come up with different ways of thinking about it, which might turn out to be useful, and be open to taking ideas from here and there.  The way I think of it, all scientific theories are ""applied metaphors"". What varies is the number of ""contact points"" there are between the metaphor and easily-shared subjective observation.   If there are lots of contact points and they're easily accessed, it becomes a proven scientific theory, an objective fact. If there are very few contact points but they're easily accessed, it might become an established philosophical position, a useful ""way of thinking"". If there are very few contact points and they're not easily accessed, it becomes a metaphysical view or it becomes a hand-waving description without details. (EDIT: 'Mystical' or religious knowledge falls in to this maybe?) Below that and there's no theory, just subjective experience and anecdotes. (EDIT: Glitches, mostly, so far.)   Science deals best with ""easily observed regularities"" which are very  simply connected with sensory experience (because we think in ""shadow experiences"").  This stuff is difficult (assuming the reports are correct). You can't observe what someone is doing in this case and you can't observe what is happening. Any theory here is going to be a metaphor which is big on description, small on contact points!  Anyway, interesting to explore this stuff regardless."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,Scroon,1 point,Wed May 13 16:05:21 2015 UTC,"Micro black hole:       Micro black holes, also called quantum mechanical black holes or mini black holes, are hypothetical tiny black holes, for which quantum mechanical effects play an important role.   It is possible that such quantum primordial black holes were created in the high-density environment of the early Universe (or big bang), or possibly through subsequent phase transitions. They might be observed by astrophysicists in the near future, through the particles they are expected to emit by Hawking radiation.  Some hypotheses involving additional space dimensions predict that micro black holes could be formed at an energy as low as the TeV range, which are available in particle accelerators such as the LHC (Large Hadron Collider). Popular concerns have then been raised over end-of-the-world scenarios (see Safety of particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider). However, such quantum black holes would instantly evaporate, either totally or leaving only a very weakly interacting residue. Beside the theoretical arguments, we can notice that the cosmic rays bombarding the Earth do not produce any damage, although they reach center of mass energies in the range of hundreds of TeV.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35stgs,Scroon,1 point,Thu May 14 04:08:45 2015 UTC,"First, thanks so much for posting this. It's fascinating, and I've previously never heard a thing about it.  Second, is this paper for real? The paper is talking about Chinese p-Teleportation experiments as if they actually happened. Could someone more informed tell me if there's any credibility to these claims/studies?  Third, here are my thoughts for a possible mechanism of p-Teleportation:  In high school, after my friend and I were taught about the probablility distribution of an electron cloud (electron location in an atom is thought of as a probablity function as opposed to a specific actual location), we would often joke about the absolute minute possibility of all the electrons clouds of our brains suddenly locating themselves outside our bodies. Result - spontaneous debraining. It was funny at the time.  Anyhow, if we consider some of the quantum/dimensional jumping theories floating around in this sub, it might be possible that these alleged Chinese kids were actively choosing the astronomically improbable quantum timeline where the entire object spontaneously relocated to the alternate location. It would be akin to quantum tunnelling, only on a macroscopic level.  Fourth, so are these studies true or not? If they are, I'm gonna try to start teleporting stuff. (I'm serious.)"

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, i go and see a psychic to get my cards read (i've never done this)  while we were walking off our sunday brunch. The lady told me a few insightful things and i actually had a couple ""WTF"" moments. But in the end she asked if i had any questions and i was drawing a blank, until i saw that she had '777' tattooed on her bicep. So i asked her if she believe in number synchonization and what not. She said she did believe in it. So i asked her about '333' and sure enough she said, ""Oh yes, the three 3's represent that you are walking on the right path..."" So I smiled and was on my way.

We are open and this has been the most significant year spiritually for both of us.   This was the first Mother's Day this past week since my GF lost her mother.

Without needing it or even believing in this sort of thing and lining it up with what is happening in our lives, we take this as a nice affirmation.   Your cries are heard and I tell you with all sincerity, humility and awe, if you connect with that love that created us and let it wash over your lives, amazing things happen. Two lazy dreamers had their bells rung and the Universe seemed to say, you are on the right track, keep that love flowing in and out of your lives.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35odoo,yonreadsthis,5,Tue May 12 04:53:38 2015 UTC,"I have temporal lobe epilepsy. Even though you are taking anti-seizure drugs, you can have absence seizures, and what you are reporting sounds like absence seizures. There's no medical test that's going to pick up an absence seizure unless you manage to have a seizure during the test. There are specific medications for absence seizures, but, personally, I didn't go there--they all have undesirable side effects.  What I did do was change my diet drastically. Did you know that there's a second ""brain"" in your gut? Article, also google on ""brain in the gut.""  That's where my absence seizures were starting. So, to keep the second brain happy, I changed to a very high-fiber (beans, lentils, berries, salad), light fat (occasional avocado and cheese), and lighter sugar  (a small chocolate bar) diet: and I haven't had a seizure of any kind except one evening when my husband and I ate a pizza.  My method might not work for you: but don't forget that you have more than one brain."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35odoo,lolliebedlam,6,Tue May 12 18:09:43 2015 UTC,Do you happen to be taking Topamax? It treats migraines and seizures and I was on it for about a week and had some really weird side effects. It actually caused me to have a seizure. I'm just curious if it's what you're on. A lot of anti-seizure meds that can treat migraines have weird mental side effects. I'm wondering if maybe your weird repeating actions started soon after you started taking the meds.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35odoo,TriumphantGeorge,5,Tue May 12 23:00:15 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm on! Super low dosage so they said this stuff shouldn't happen. UGH. Thank you so much, at least I know what's going on."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35odoo,lolliebedlam,4,Wed May 13 00:36:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they started me off on 200mg because my nurse practitioner saw that was the dose you get up to, but it's not the dose you start out at. Normally you start at 25mg or so and taper up.   It might not be the drug, but if this started soon after you started it, I'd definitely be concerned. I did a little more digging and it says confusion isn't a dose-dependent side effect. It also says it can cause nervousness. So maybe combine the two and suddenly you could have the symptoms you're displaying.   My side effects were far more severe since my nurse practitioner was a moron. I had one day where I thought I closed my laptop several times before actually closing it. No one was around to see though, so I couldn't ask anyone to back me up. I had this weird feeling that something was wrong, but I couldn't articulate it. One night I woke up screaming for help because I had a nightmare and was surprised when my current boyfriend and his friend came rushing in the room. I thought I was still with an ex-boyfriend. The worst was after the seizure it caused, I didn't know who I was or where I was. I had no idea who my friends in the room with me were. I thought the cat was God and was speaking to me. Then I thought I was experiencing some kind of grand deja vu where everything had happened before, but I needed to make it stop, so I tried to break down the front door.   Needless to say, Topamax was a terrible choice for me. I've heard lots of people having great results from it. I've never had a history of strange mental behaviors like that. The worst I had dealt with has been depression and some anxiety, but this was like a psychotic break. I don't want to scare you, but I thought I'd give you the whole story. The paramedics that came (my roommates called because I tried to break down the door and then thought I was an ageless God creature that had to sacrifice myself for the good of humanity) acted like it couldn't be Topamax causing it. The one said his wife took it for migraines and if anything, it made her sluggish. Drugs are really strange and affect people in all kinds of different ways. It's definitely something to look more into especially if this started soon after you began taking it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35odoo,TriumphantGeorge,3,Wed May 13 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"I had one day where I thought I closed my laptop several times before actually closing it.    So this sounds like the answer. Still though, the effects of these drugs (and TLE whether that overlaps or not) are interesting. It's like they break down your focus or filter for sequencing time/moments.  Or maybe it's that every intention produces a little pseduo-imagining of doing it - like it generates the experience but the action doesn't get to the ""outside world"".   I was an ageless God creature that had to sacrifice myself for the good of humanity   Plot twist: This is probably true - says most religions. Except for the sacrifice bit maybe. Actually, going by other glitch stories, it's probably more true that the cat was God."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35odoo,paremiamoutza,1 point,Wed May 13 07:34:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's exactly what you described in the second paragraph. You think you're doing the thing you're trying to do. Your brain tricks you into believing you actually did it, but in reality, it didn't happen, you just thought it.  And I wouldn't be surprised if the cat actually was God. My theory on all cats is that owning a cat is like being in an abusive relationship. You want to love them. You want to make them happy. They want you when they feel like it and other than that, fuck it. And that kind of meshes with what God is supposed to be like at least according to my perception of the classes I had to take to make my First Holy Communion. He loves us, but he doesn't intervene unless he feels like it. And sometimes he tests us just to see if we'll do his bidding. Abraham, anyone? Or Job, that was some pretty fucked up shit. Sounds like something a cat would do."

Your brain tricks you into believing you actually did it, but in reality, it didn't happen, you just thought it.   ...and it persists in the delusion  until it ""checks"" and discovers that it didn't play out. A bit like the guy finding his car keys in the dark in this post. As if our intentions trigger a ""stock animation"" that fills the gap between ""lookings"". If we get it wrong, we have the experience of ""being reset"" as our perceptions are corrected with the latest information.  Basically, we dream our lives ""inspired by"" periodic informational updates from the senses?   My theory on all cats is that owning a cat is like being in an abusive relationship.    Ha, that's so right. Also, my sister has the amusing idea that there is only one cat really (she saw a cat that looked exactly like hers when on holiday), the uni-cat, that is simultaneously in all cat locations at once. Interestingly, this syncs with a theory that there is actually only one electron (all electrons look alike except their location), but because they are time-independent - we are seeing one electron in all the possible places that that electron could be across eternity.  Well, that ""strayed"" from the point eh."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35p1nn,TriumphantGeorge,3,Tue May 12 11:12:31 2015 UTC,"The story is from Anthony Peake's Is there Life after Death? which isn't so much about death as his metaphysical scheme for life (involving a self and a higher self, in an eternal replay environment: an updating of eternalism and some gnostic ideas). I've copied the relevant section:   For those who suffer from TLE [Temporal Lobe Epilepsy] much of what I have suggested will come as no surprise. It may be the case the this book may help explain some of the most bizarre cases known to psychiatrists and neurologists, particularly one reported in the journal Psychopathology in 2003. Written by two Japanese psychiatrists, the article described how a male patient with TLE was convinced he had repeatedly lived the part of his life between the ages of 21 to 25. As the patient reported:  ""Up until the age of 25, my life was unremarkable. I was employed, and often enjoyed going for drives or to karaoke with my friends on weekends. I cannot remember the details. At the age of 25 I married a girl from Hiroshima, and lived safely. Nothing particular happened after my marriage. However, soon after, I noticed that I was again 21 years old and unmarried... Then I lived again between the ages of 21 to 25. Once again I held the same job, and again at the age of 25, I married the same girl. This endless cycle has already repeated itself five or six times. Now I am sure I will continue forever. I attempted suicide to escape from this endless repetition.""  This is a real-life equivalent of Groundhog Day, consisting of not one day but four years. For this individual the temporal fugue was so real that he committed suicide at the (externally observed) age of 28. If my theory is correct then this unfortunate person really was living his life over and over again.  -- Is there Life after Death?, Anthony Peake   The quote is sourced as:   Murrai T &  Fukao K 'Paramnesic Multiplication of Autobiographical Memory as a Manifestatiion of Interictal Psychosis' p49-51 (original paper here)   I'm not sure what to think about the discrepancy of the loop being 21-25yrs and him committing suicide at 28yrs."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35p1nn,TriumphantGeorge,2,Tue May 12 19:38:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah. In another comment I figured that the suicide might be the cause of the loop (21-25yrs). Perhaps he didn't commit suicide at 25 one time, made it further, realised he'd already had that experience too, got to 28. Thus restarting the loop.  Basically (in my imagination), whenever he commit suicide he gets reset to 21yrs. He just had a few times of ending at 25. When he finally dies of old age, at 85, he'll be back again. Perhaps we all will.   (That's kind of Anthony Peake's idea in the book: We are living the memory of our lives, perhaps on repeat. Which is a bit like the old idea of ""creation is complete"" and we are just experiencing it.)"

For example, if someone takes a hallucinogen then the drug is a key (quite literally because it acts as an agonist or antagonist to a lock) to a door to another dimension/view of the world. We think our current reality is the only reality but perhaps it is just because our minds occupy this homeostasis most of the time but in rare cases can be knocked into another state which is permanent and becomes the new equilibrium."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35m5eg,LeaveTheMatrix,3,Tue May 12 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"Remote viewing:       Remote viewing (RV) is the practice of seeking impressions about a distant or unseen target using subjective means, in particular, extrasensory perception (ESP) or ""sensing with mind"". There is no credible scientific evidence that remote viewing works, and the topic of remote viewing is regarded as pseudoscience.        Typically a remote viewer is expected to give information about an object, event, person or location that is hidden from physical view and separated at some distance.  The term was coined in the 1970s by physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, parapsychology researchers at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), to distinguish it from the closely related concept of clairvoyance.    Remote viewing was popularized in the 1990s upon the declassification of certain documents related to the Stargate Project, a $20 million research program that had started in 1975 and was sponsored by the U.S. government, in an attempt to determine any potential military application of psychic phenomena. The program was terminated in 1995 after it failed to produce any useful intelligence information.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35m1jo,pacificsun,13,Mon May 11 17:33:11 2015 UTC,"Really, so what is the theory I'm proposing? You definitely didn't read those links.  I'm suggesting that you have accidentally selected your future events according to a pattern, formatted your own future path, to an extreme degree. There is no power outside of you making it  happen. The more you encounter a pattern, the more you notice a pattern, the stronger the selection is.  The pattern affects things 4-dimensionally, even though you only encounter it one moment at a time.  You end up looking around just at the exact moment a pattern is there. Reading material and conversations are centred around the pattern. Actually are centred around the pattern - it's not just a case of you noticing. Numbers are the easily recognised one, but any pattern or relationship behaves the same way, once you get into it.  The implication? That your experiences and thoughts actually select your later experiences. The inevitable conclusion is that you to some extent live in your own private universe - a subjective idealist reality - which is effectively an extension to your own mind. And the more you focus, the more you end up in situations which give you more of the same.  You might find this interview with Kirby Surprise (great name) interesting. His book Synchronicity is probably the only one worth reading on the topic.  EDIT: Seriously, I don't mean to be snippy. What you are experiencing is what genuine  full-effect synchronicity looks like. I've been generating it deliberately lately. It's like cutting a whole in your reality filter and suddenly new sets of events, new parts of the universe, manage to leak through."

By synchronicity I mean ""collections of experiences arising over time which are of the same pattern"".  And it's not an explanation, it's an observation of a pattern.   Look, I've tried everything in this area too and after experimenting with it, and as far as I can see any useable model requires that we introduce some temporal landscape concept. Although we experience things moment-by-moment, that's not how it's laid out behind the scenes.  I know:   It's not hallucination. If you deliberately attempt to create synchronicity, you can. It seems like pattern-selection in a 4D environment.   It's not supernatural. It's not God. It's not other beings.  It's not a simulation. It's not ""you"" in the sense of making deliberate choices.

As you'll have noticed, there is no way to measure this objectively other than through the experiences of people, so designing a study is problematic (I've considered doing this). At the moment it's restricted to personal investigation.  But, why don't you (by which I mean ""everyone"") do your own experimentation? It's easy to do. Choose a particular pattern, get really absorbed in it, notice how it appears in ways that can't be explained by just noticing stuff, notice how it is self-reinforcing.  The best fit so far that fits the experience and isn't ""the matrix did it"" is there is some filtering process going on. Others (Dr Surprise) have proposed that a model based on string theory might be able to account for it in principle because it can take in the higher dimensional component. I find it a bit of a stretch, personally."

Look, I dont want to make an enemy of you and I have no wish to fight or have it devolve into insults as happens too often on reddit. I just see it differently. I can get that you can make a self-fulfilling prophecy. The man who is convinced he is going to die will find a way to make it happen. Look at Jim Carey. Wrote himself a check for a million or something and kept it in his wallet, believing one day it would be real, one day he'd have a success big enough to match it. And then he did. He claims it was synchronicity. I say he gave himself the confidence and that confidence made the difference. But that's totally different than affecting electronic devices or graffiti on walls.

You've read all the theories online but none of them work for you. So either you're looking over what something is trying to tell you or you haven't found your answer yet.  At the moment you seem so frustrated by 2 decades of this that no answer will be acceptable for you. I think you should meditate on it. Quiet your mind and ask why. Start with five minutes a day, then ten, etc. Be patient and let it come to you.   That's how I got my answers for most of my questions. Key words are ""my answers"" not ""the answers."" Everyone has a different path and different things to learn in life. Good luck on your journey.  Edit- I'm just suggesting a method to get your answer. I'm not saying you will by meditating, but try different methods for seeking answers. No one else can tell you what it really means. You have to find that yourself."

Pretty much all clocks work in a similar way, perhaps you are somehow adjusting the time with electromagnetic waves you are emitting? The fact that one of the clocks actually powered off when you touched it points to this theory, since you made it ""crash"" or malfunction in some way. I wonder what the encoded clock pulse for ""11:11"" actually is, could be something like a square wave.  Can't explain the graffiti though, or your Mom picking up on it somehow.

I feel like I could be so enlightened right now and there's secrets of the universe that I could be a part of if it weren't for me trying to fit in by being an ass to the people that the ""cool kids"" didn't like.  I went back after being in shock for a few minutes to check on the driver, give my eyewitness account to the police officer and to look for the note.   It was on regular printer paper. Looked to be 8.5x14 because the schedule was a little larger than letter size. It was written with a black marker with near perfect penmanship, almost as if it had been printed, but the font and the marker strokes gave away the fact it was written. The pole holding it had a metal enclosure that was exactly the size of the schedule. It usually had a plastic cover but that was missing. It's a little hard to explain. Imagine an 8.5""x14"" cookie sheet with a piece of paper taped to it ...I think that's the best description I can give.  As for the report I gave the police, it was met with obvious skepticism. The officer I spoke with asked me to give my account of the events and I told him everything except how rude I was to Sylvan.* He didn't seem very attentive and replied to everything I said with ""Go on"" or ""Uh-huh."" I asked him what he thought about the whole thing at the end and he told me he thought I should go home and get some rest. I was a pretty timid kid around adults so I kind of hung my head and agreed.  As for the note, the pole holding the schedule was the only thing the car missed. The note was gone, but I could still clearly see a piece of tape and a tiny shred of paper attached to it as if it had been ripped off in a hurry. Something makes me want to believe that the kid ripped it off right before he took off so that I wouldn't have any evidence to piece together what happened, but another part of me wants to believe that the cops didn't want my story to have any credibility so they could play this off as someone that fell asleep at the wheel or had a seizure or got drunk rather than opening a paranormal investigation. I honestly don't know what happened, I don't even know how much I'd be able to figure out even if it was still there but at that point I was looking for anything to prove to someone (myself included) that I wasn't crazy.  *Sylvan: That was what we referred to the kid as. It's the name of a children's development facility. It's kind of on par with naming a terminally ill child St. Jude or someone born with no legs Mt. Everest. The name was intended to be ironic and cruel...I am actually the one who regrettably came up with it and everyone thought I was hilarious so it stuck. I've been hesitant to use it because I believe karma had a big role in why so much of this is still a mystery to me and I don't want to be fucking myself over."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35imnm,TheOnlyOtherRedditor,3,Mon May 11 05:14:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the elaboration, what a crazy experience! FWIW, the other kid probably wouldn't have been able to do much other than confirm that the note existed, and that he felt 'weird' right before things happened... although just having company in a strange moment has value.   As for karma, if that stuff really works, I think you being genuinely contrite and 'learning your lesson' would go a long way towards paying your debt. You're not calling him that to be a douche and admit your own faults... I think you're probably ok, although I'm not the karma police."

Maybe he chose me because I was just a follower and didn't have bad intent even though my actions were hurting others.   The probability of him having that premonition (or in an extreme case, ability) are like a billion to one but I'll never know for sure."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35imnm,polkadotgirl,5,Mon May 11 05:40:05 2015 UTC,"I keep my mind pretty open to possibilities, but I doubt that the dude was in control of anything. From your description of his action, it really doesn't sound like he 'knew' what was going on.    Besides, even if you spoke to him you'd never know for sure. If he was 'in' on it as you suspect, he'd lie to you to cover his tracks. If he wasn't 'in' on it, you'd never be able to tell if he was pretending ignorance.

The biggest change between me in this story and me now is the way I treat other people which can be traced back to what I deem important. I never had malicious intent or meant any kind of harm to this kid. I simply disregarded his own feelings hoping that it would improve my social status enough to fit in, be accepted and score a hot date (normal high school priorities).   Today, I'm more aware of the feelings of other people and would never be an ass to someone to fit in. I don't want to fit in with such cruel group mentality. Looking back, high school was a really shitty place where I dictated my actions on what people that of me. Now, reputation is important and all, but the people I was looking for acceptance from were people that I didn't even like and who's actions I didn't agree with. I honestly don't know what drove me to go to such lengths to be liked by them, but if I could go back, I would probably go out of my way to make sure that I am disliked by them.  TL;DR I no longer go out of my way to pick on people just because the starting quarterback doesn't like them because people like that are now the last people that I want acceptance from."

It's not necessarily that you're more ""right"" than other people, it's that you come to innately understand how inner belief can actually alter reality. Whether it's only subjectively or objectively is hard to say, because we only experience things subjectively.  I think ""religious kid"" simply understood innately that there was some meaning in his being in that particular situation that you did not/were not ready to pick up on at that time. Whether you believe it is God or the universe... well, now that you've matured a little, it might be time for you to consider seeking deeper answers. I was agnostic in high school, became a religious believer later on, and I am now more of an agnostic/deist again. Overall I would say it is better to experience these things in order to understand how limited our individual idea of ""open-minded"" is. Even the most ""open-minded"" person has really just decided that they understand what it means to be ""open-minded""... which might make them the most closed-minded of all.

They could have used something to disorient her and cause memory loss, but worried about collateral damage and put up a sign.  This would not be a very effective place have someone crash as there are no serious dangers on the side of the road, at least in the picture.  The flaw in this thought is how they specifically timed it.  It would be more plausible that they would know the location of the crash if she was coming off of a turn, but that is hard to tell from the picture.  To rule this out as a possibility, you'd need to find a report of the crash and check to see if the named woman is still alive.  It is also possible, more so probably, that there was a coordinated effort to assassinate someone who regularly takes that bus at that stop.  The crash was very well timed with people waiting.  Maybe a party felt guilty and put up the sign, only to take it down before their partner could see that anyone was warned.  This would explain why your story was ignored.  I can't think of a way to prove this, but it would be suspicious if in the official report your full statement was not included, or if anyone in the area after the crash had a suspicious background.

It's something we refer to as temporal dysphoria.     I don't have a feeling that my mother left the room and someone else entered.  In fact I can honestly say that apart from the memory prior to that moment I have never felt that my mother is actually my mother.  And it's feeling that my mother has all but said she shares concerning me being her daughter.  In fact we really don't even look similar.     What I'm now wondering is if I was actually born the 1850s  and something like a glitch occurred and as a baby I crossed over into this reality.

The problem with this situation is that there's really nothing truly describes our situation. .       I've had people mention time slips, reincarnation, etc.  But none of them account for the feeling (belief) that many of us hold that something went wrong when we were extremely young. A feeling of one moment we were someplace else and the next we're in a world that just doesn't ""feel"" right."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35lbku,autowikibot,2,Mon May 11 15:03:34 2015 UTC,"Well, assuming this isn't just a psychological condition, it could be a case of reincarnation where you ""forgot"" to forget. There's been a bit of discussion here about the exact time a ""soul"" might enter a baby's body - if that even happens at all.  In this case, you may have ""entered"" the baby's body from your 1890's self. At this point, you would have realized your current mother is not your 1890's mother which would explain the shift in feeling.  You have a continuous memory because you are accessing your current body's physical brain. However, your ""higher self"" still has that feeling you belong somewhere else.  If it helps, we're all from other places and other times. Just try to enjoy the one you're in right now?"

There's a good reason that the submission form on this subreddit says ""When you were a kid... stop. Due to the way human memory works, one can easily confuse dreams or fantasies with reality."" Every toddler I've ever known has a difficult time distinguishing dreams from reality, and struggles with concepts like object permanence.   I have a very vivid memory from when I was no more than three years old, believing that my dad had been replaced by an alien. Earlier that evening my sisters and I had been watching a meteor shower, and I was thinking about aliens. Then when we went inside my dad made some kind of facial expression that seemed odd to me, and I was convinced that he was an alien pretending to be my dad. Today, as an adult, I don't believe that my dad was replaced by an alien, because I can recognize that children jump to some wild conclusions about what they experience because they don't have a very solid understanding of the world.  As for your belief that you belong in another time period, that's fine. I'm not going to try to refute what you believe about yourself. But the phrase ""temporal dysphoria"" only describes that you experience the sensation of being in the wrong time. The fact that the feeling has been given a name doesn't say anything about the cause of the feeling.  I also experience a distinct amount of dysphoria. Dysphoria is simply a word used to describe unease, unhappiness, and anxiety. Temporal dysphoria is just anxiety that you feel about the time period you are living in. Someone suffering from delusions could be described as suffering from temporal dysphoria.   If you want to continue believing you were born in the 1850s, don't let me stop you. It's just that holding onto this belief might only cause you further dysphoria, because as it is, there is no clear remedy that can send you back in time."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35kovr,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Wed May 13 09:12:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry I didn't know it didn't post my answer. Ok! Lay down on your back and meditate (relax and clear your mind). Picture a rope or ladder and pretend to climb up it using first person. Remember what it felt like the first time. When you pop out it feels like falling so you might get scared and pop back in your body. Just practice until you get used to the feeling. To travel faster you can picture a portal you go into and picture where it leads (friends house, moon, underground). You can even go to the sun if you want. You are traveling using your consciousness or soul depending. Heat and such cannot hurt you. Don't worry about getting lost or anything you if you wanna go back to your body just focus on being back and boom your back. If you have any more questions I'm happy to help! Good luck!!!"

No we can't explain exactly how it works  But if you took a strictly classical interpretation, then much of this would be impossible.  I also think a lot of us are more interested in the science of what could be.  We see no use in waiting around for mainstream science to bless these new theories because that could take another 50 years or more and we could be dead by then"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35f95y,BlahBlahBlasphemee,2,Sat May 9 20:32:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely a strictly classical interpretation is no good. But neither are any of the current quantum mechanical interpretations (assuming they can be meaningfully extended to large scale).  That's why I think we should feel free to explore our own philosophical approach. After all, that's where the current crop of physical theories began. The concept of  ""atoms"" was a philosophical idea long before it became a foundation of science (nice summary here).   This is what's needed today: Fresh concepts which provide a conceptual framework for our observations, which then might lead to more focused study, which then might lead to an expansion of science to incorporate them.  Exciting times..."

The scientific theories have mathematical and sometimes observational evidence to back them up so they may not pan out, but they have a decent shot."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35f95y,Scroon,1 point,Sun May 10 01:35:45 2015 UTC,"Follow philosophy, not current science?   Current science, for sure, but as it is not as it is fantasised to be. As you say, the 'bleeding edge' is where the interesting things are. In a way, established science can be said to be ""hardened philosophy"".  Many times we have a comment which amount to ""scientists now know"" and ""the double-slit experiment proves that"" as a pat answer, either to assert or dismiss an idea. In some ways, it's become the new ""absence seizure!"". It's unfortunate because it tends to stop further thinking.   Some people are under the impression that things are understood, that there is an authority position on the matter, when this is not the case. A lot of this comes from the gee-whizz articles in popular publications, which make sweeping claims and predictions, which overstate the case. Some of this is funding promo talk though. (Remember when DNA was a ""blueprint for the person"" and there was going to be a gene for every characteristic?) This applies to QM, neuroscience and consciousness studies, understanding of perception, all those interesting areas.  So it's worth knowing this - that a bit of a theory being a 'little bit like' something doesn't equate to an explanation of a phenomenon, there's still work to be done. In much the same way as naming and categorising a phenomenon doesn't explain it either.   The scientific theories have mathematical and sometimes observational evidence to back them up so they may not pan out, but they have a decent shot.   Is ""mathematical evidence"" actually evidence? Having a self-consistent conceptual model doesn't mean much unless it connects to observational evidence (a problem with both many-worlds and string theory).   Anyway, as far as glitches are concerned we have the problem that their nature means that it's pretty hard to study. They are impossible to anticipate, and most seem to leave no trace except in the memories of the observers. If someone can come up with a way to capture this in some sort of study (beyond anecdote collection), where people cause and observe them, that would be amazing and it could become a scientific area."

We'd have to pick one of the theories to base the hypothesis on and decide on the type of glitch to attempt. My intitial feeling was to try to change or force a minor detail based on forced assumption or mass imagery.  For example, 100 people drawing random cards and trying to force a particular card to show up more often. Or one person drawing a card, and the 100 people trying to force a certain card either before or after the fact.  Just thinking about it for now."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35f95y,BlahBlahBlasphemee,1 point,Mon May 11 12:00:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. My gut feeling is: this can only be proved to yourself, and people who don't want it proved can't have it proved to them.

Everyone seemed like they were on eggshells when speaking to me as if my mother had just died.   After several similar comments I finally asked someone why everyone was being so concerned. The girl I asked said ""Oh well...everyone knows about the accident."" I asked a couple of other people and everyone was convinced that I had been in some kind of gruesome incident. The really fucked up thing, was that no one could agree what exactly the accident was.   One person thought it was auto. Another person heard I fell while hiking and broke multiple bones.

Me and my dad were in the apartment together when all of a sudden there was a shake. Not like an earthquake but almost from  something similar like an asteroid impact, possibly a flash. I remember looking at wall and everything tilted from the commotion. Out of curiosity me and my dad went to see what the hell was going on outside. So we walk down the street where all these army vehicles were gathered at and asking what's going on. Remember the military police being panicky and violent. Think I got knocked out with blunt force from a gun. Next thing I know I'm back in the apartment with my dad. I was pretty good telling the difference between dreams and memories and it definately felt like a memory. Even asked my dad if he remembered it a year later and I Think he said no. Looking back on it, it feels like a repressed memory as if something tried to alter my memory not to remember. Couple hours from dc when it happened so that why I posted this too.

The weird part about the story is that his phone called my phone when we bumped into each other.   I rarely ever saw this person or talked to this person. He was a friend of a friend and we never called each other or texted. Sure, his phone could have just acted up and made a call. We can take everything out about the phone being in a backpack, not moving, what have you.   Let's say you have 100 contacts (he probably had more). You walk around a public area with your phone out. You have an app that randomly selects a contact. You tell yourself you are going to use the app when you run into one of the 100 people in your phone. You bump into Sarah and deliberately use the app. The chances that the randomly selected contact is Sarah is 1 percent. That's pretty low.   Now lets say you can't deliberately use the app. 5 times a day it just randomly selects a contact (a high estimate of butt dials per day). You bump into Sarah and chat for five minutes. I don't know the math on this but it would be crazy slim if the app selects Sarah at that specific time.   When you add in that there is no app and a butt dial would be super unlikely to occur in a backpack, the chances just get minisculely small.   If you want to look at it from a glitch perspective, the call could have been from a parallel universe that instead of us bumping into each other, he accidentally or purposefully called me for some reason.

What does this mean? That when we close our eyes, the reality around us stops existing? Or simply that when we close our eyes, we cannot see what's around us?    in quantum mechanics we can see the very strong evidence that physical matter is not as it appears to be.   In quantum mechanics we can see evidence that the Newtonian model of physics is incomplete. QM is another layer of descriptions for the universe, not a ""hey you had it all wrong until now"" statement.    Waves of energy are not solid. They are not particles.   Actually. They are. Sort of. Think of a Slinky (tm). You can compress the spring and release it to make sort of a ""wave"" or compressed metal. That compressed metal is, essentially, acting in the same way a solid mass would, but it's really just metal bound together by the potential and kinetic energy in the spring.  When the particle/wave of metal hits an object, the particle loses some of its energy and dissipates back into the rest of the Slinky (tm). The metal particle has thus dissolved into kinetic energy that has affected an object, or is potential energy stored in the slinky again.   This is an oversimplified, but hopefully workable, idea of how wave/particle duality actually works.    Waves of energy are not solid. They are not particles. So why is this behaviour observed in matter and revealed in the double-slit experiment? Why can a photon, or electron become a particle, then return to a wave or vice-versa? If it was a solid particle, it should always be a solid particle.   See above. It's not ""becoming"" a particle, it's more ""acting like"" a particle.    There should never be this dualism.   Your assertion at the end ""If it was a solid particle, it should always be a solid particle. There should never be this dualism,"" is unsupported by any facts or citations. The evidence suggests that dualism exists. And very intelligent people have found a lot of evidence that it does. You saying ""there should never be this dualism,"" is an argument from ignorance and incredulity. You're effectively saying, ""I don't understand this, therefore it is impossible."" Which is a logical fallacy.   As for the Whitworth paper, he suggests that something exterior to the universe is processing and forming the universe. If that is true, then there is no way for us to test it. At best, we could determine the rules of the simulation, but science cannot test things outside of the universe. Those are by definition ""supernatural"" and outside of testable reality.   We could come close to determining the rules of the simulation, but belief in a virtual reality is still that, belief."

I am deliberately using that term as it fits what happens when the brain ""processes"" visual information and ""outputs"" that information as a ""rendered"" final product of sensory information.  There really is no better word to describe the act of taking information and transcribing it into a view.  The computer metaphor with the term rendering is precisely what the brain is doing with sensory information.  It renders this information as output for us to interact with as an interface.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_%28computer_graphics%29   Light acts as a wave and particle depending on context.    What is the criteria for it to be a particle?  Let's start there.   Because the computer simulation is making it act as such, right?    The simulation is rendering the particle thus it acts as a particle because information has been accessed that needs to be rendered following the laws of Information Conservation.   And that simulation is somehow working through our brains?    Our brains are part of the simulation, as are we.  The brain also facilitates it's own version if virtual reality if you follow our discussion on information processing via sensory inputs to a rendered interface as the final product of how the brain creates a view of sensory data.   What is ""this""? Your idea? Or that science cannot find out about things outside the universe?    Hardly my idea.  And I don't think science is incapable of finding out this answer.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35aep4,TriumphantGeorge,5,Mon May 11 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, some good essentials there, but I worry that the metaphor drowns out the actual core understanding?  As I see it, the basics of our world are:   Our experiences take the form of the senses, which includes the sense of spatial extension and temporal evolution. The world-as-it-truly-is, is more akin to dimensionless ""facts"" dissolved into the background - a metaphorical landscape which we traverse with our attention. What we are is ""that which experiences"", hence anything we experience (images of brains, etc) is not us. We are not brains, and brains do not interpret anything - they are part of the picture.   To say we live in a ""virtual reality"" is really just to say that we don't sensorily experience the world as it truly is. We might call this ""information"" but really it is nothing that corresponds to concepts such as this.  However you imagine it, it is not. In fact, any metaphorical scheme we use - simulations, or whatever - is just a way of having visualisable concepts to think-about relationships. It is not ""true"", right?  Reality seems to be a memory-like ""patterning process"".   Metaphor itself seems to shape experience, in fact, which makes pinning the whole thing down even trickier! This results in a dream-like aspect, as particularly highlighted when you actively explore the synchronistic process. This self-reflecting aspect is what gives rise to glitches, perhaps."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35aep4,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Fri May 8 15:09:29 2015 UTC,You have some very good points.  Virtual reality as a term does sound very artificial to something as dynamic and self-evolved our reality.  It does compose the idea that we are simply simulations on a computer.  The reason why I adopt the term is based on the nature of existing in an information based reality where information is processed and rendered only.  What you said about experience and the one having them I believe is very fundamental to who we are relative to the ones having the experiences.  Reality does cater to experience however that equates itself in this process.

It's just that it has associations in fiction and technology. It's a metaphor, sure, but I'm weary of the number of time people assert they are literally living in a computer situation after reading about the ""information universe"" or whatever. I do understand the motivation.  ""Information"" can be a bit of a vague term too. I prefer talking about facts-of-the-world or similar, experiential patterns, mind-formatting, something that evokes specifics, but it's really audience-dependent.   What you said about experience and the one having them I believe is very fundamental to who we are relative to the ones having the experiences. Reality does cater to experience however that equates itself in this process.   I'm inclined to say that we cannot know what we are, as an object. We ""become"" our experiences. Usually we identify with one bit of experience vs the rest, but interestingly we can change which bits we identify with...  When you have a precog dream, where are you? Are you ""really"" in your body but seeing an image of the future (by unpacking the ""information"" in the background)?

When you have a precog dream, where are you?  You exist in non-locality and you are correct, it does not take place inside the body.  Precognition can be looked at as a template for the future, or a blueprint as part of a creative process where we are in fact creating the future event during this but for the most part unconscious of the process or our involvement."

Yes.  If time is a landscape, then in everyday expereince are ""attention"" following a trajectory across it. Every imaginative intention we have, I propose, applies to the whole landscape at once. So we are continually updating the future and the past, blindly.   In a precognitive dream or other intuition, however, we have opened up our attention to encompass more than just one moment, and can knowingly update while experiencing the change occur - in ""advance"" as it were.  I've been experimenting a little with this, via patterning and synchronciity. An assertive summary on The Patterning of Experience,  a recent comment on synchronicity here, general idea is that in effect all time and space is available to imagination.  EDIT: Elsewhere you said ""literal dreamworld"". That's basically it, I say the world is literally imagination. Your experience works on an ""as if"" basis. As if there is a timeline, as if there is extended space, as if there are ""facts"" of the world, and so on - whenever you implicitly imagine that something is true, it is. (Not the same as belief.) Really there is just the sensory arising in awareness, consistent with implicit facts, and nothing else behind it. Make a change to those facts, experience will immediately fall into alignment with the update - as if it had always been true. This makes experimentation quite challenging."

There's so much we don't know about the world, especially the quantum world, yet you're talking as if you know everything about it. That's usually a sign that the person talking about it doesn't have a clue what they're on about or has some pretty big misconceptions.  Maybe the world is virtual. Most likely it isn't. There isn't really any solid evidence at all for it yet."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35aep4,BlahBlahBlasphemee,3,Fri May 8 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe we have been in the wrong paradigm when addressing the world thus have a mass misconception about what it actually is.  The ideas that I present are not simply something that I conjured up in my own imagination rather there are a lot of condensed information that comes from research and studies regarding the idea that all reality is virtual.  For example, the behavior of particle/wave duality in carbon-60 atoms.  I am not making that up.  That is a scientific fact.  The fact that information can produce a virtual reality is not fantasy, we see that in action through computing as the new norm.  The fact that our brain also produces a virtual reality is not fantasy, it is self-evident.  There is no misconception in presenting that view-point.    The fact that dreams are also a type of virtual reality produced by the brain is self-evident.  I cannot see how stating this as a fact stems from not knowing what I am talking about.  I would argue that the paradigm of living in a physical world is where most reside today.  Challenges to any paradigm creates friction in the intellectual egos of those who have adopted their paradigm as being the correct one.  The double-slit will likely always be the smoking gun and returning point for science when trying to address the virtual nature of reality.  The GEO600 experiment produced holographic noise which started to turn more heads in that direction.  We now have dedicated research into determining if this reality is virtual, not because that is a fun idea but because attributes of existing in a virtual reality are appearing in certain experiments.  So the paradigm is shifting, and we may already have that evidence but choose to reword it so that we call an ace a spade which is what I believe has occurred with the handling of particle/wave duality in the interpretation of that phenomena."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35aep4,BlahBlahBlasphemee,5,Fri May 8 14:16:37 2015 UTC,"Can't forget other pieces of evidence like checksum discovered in superstring equations, the digital nature of the universe (contrary to claims of the opposite) instead of it being analog; there is a smallest unit of time and length, being the planck time and length respectively (likely to save space; conservation). Moreover, the fractal properties of our environment, which is likely another mechanism of the law of conservation at work.   There is also some circumstantial evidence in pseudo-science, such as precognition, deja vu, experiences observed under the influence of psychedelics, and out of body experiences. Furthermore, one can wonder if the multiverse/parallel universe theories that have come to the forefront are accurate. Assuming they are true, it may be due to many simulations running at once with different variables to test an array of probable outcomes."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,35aep4,xxabie,2,Sat May 9 00:45:37 2015 UTC,"In dealing with computers, when data is transmitted (such as downloading a file from a server) it is sent with a numerical value that's calculated using the amount of bits in the original data. Then the receiver of the data uses the same formula to see if the received data yields the same numerical value as the original data. If the value is the same then you know the data wasn't corrupted.  Dr. Sylvester James Gates Jr has discovered that supersymmetry equations contain identical error-correcting codes. However, opponents of his hypothesis suggest that the similarities observed between computers and supersymmetry equations are mere coincidences similar to the strong law of small numbers (smaller numbers such as 5 or 7 are more common in everyday life than a number such as 3452643 or 45623425). Moreover lending further support to the detractors, many mathematical models and equations represent the world, and have been used to develop computing processes (fractals, golden ratio, fibonacci sequence) that suggest that the similarities are likely due to random chance."

Science is just playing catch-up to what already is.  For me, this model fits perfectly in how I experience my reality.  It explains everything glitchy and quirky in the relationship.  My experience with deja vu linked to past dreams is my own smoking gun telling of a much different nature in reality then the current ideas.  There certainly is a lot more under the hood and worth investigating scientifically.  The answer is right in front of us.  We are the ones left with challenge of realizing it or not."

For the most part these are already ideas I'm well acquainted with, although I hadn't seen that whole atoms had been shown to exhibit particle/wave duality. That is very interesting. I always assumed that dualism was limited to the subatomic world. So the question remains: how large can dualism be scaled up? I always assumed that the macroscopic world would play by rules more akin to Newtonian physics, and that quantum physics would really only come into play at subatomic levels."

Everything emerges from information, it must scale into the astronomical cosmology we gaze into."

I feel the answer lies in what a being would be like if it lived an Eternity.   There would be no reason to reproduce as we would never die.  We would have no connection with anyone of our kind as we knew we would live forever.  We would be indifferent to others as we knew we had billions of tomarrows to connect with them if we choose.  We would find this disconnection very unsettling after awhile but still postpone any attempt to make a connection.  The thing that likely is missing is empathy.   How can we cultivate this empathy?  We would create an experience, selecting the one we choose before we are born into it, so that we live trails and tribulations that give us the effect we want to achieve.  The purpose of suffering is so we learn what another experiences.  Once we understand how going without and the suffering we experience is directly connected to understanding another, empathy is born.  Once it is born, it continues to build upon itself.  To accomplish this we had to work with an avatar (in a way) that does not have the ability to live forever and knows it will cease to be.  Thus adding a value to existance that an Eternal being would not understand until it experiences it.  We are removed from our real selves and barely catch a glimpse of who we truely are.  We are required to not know so that these experiences would feel real and thus we gain value from the experiences.  Perhaps we mine experiences so we can evolve beyond what we started out as?"

I never read Kant (for no reason I can discern!) but his description of space and time in transcendental idealism is agreeable to me:   The salient element here is that space and time, rather than being real things-in-themselves or empirically mediated appearances (German: Erscheinungen), are the very forms of intuition (German: Anschauung) by which we must perceive objects. They are hence neither to be considered properties that we may attribute to objects in perceiving them, nor substantial entities of themselves. They are in that sense subjective, yet necessary, preconditions of any given object insofar as this object is an appearance and not a thing-in-itself. Humans necessarily perceive objects as located in space and in time. This condition of experience is part of what it means for a human to cognize an object, to perceive and understand it as something both spatial and temporal. . .  . . .Kant's view is better characterized as a two-aspect theory, where noumena and phenomena refer to complementary ways of considering an object.

There is no credible scientific evidence that remote viewing works, and the topic of remote viewing is regarded as pseudoscience.        Typically a remote viewer is expected to give information about an object, event, person or location that is hidden from physical view and separated at some distance.  The term was coined in the 1970s by physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, parapsychology researchers at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), to distinguish it from the closely related concept of clairvoyance.    Remote viewing was popularized in the 1990s upon the declassification of certain documents related to the Stargate Project, a $20 million research program that had started in 1975 and was sponsored by the U.S. government, in an attempt to determine any potential military application of psychic phenomena.

Same kid (Kevin). Same villains (Harry and Marv). Same holiday (Christmas.) Same general conceit that he outsmarts them with his booby traps all around the house. Same predictability. Same writer (John Hughes). Same director (Chris Columbus).  There are MANY callbacks to the original, including references to Angels with Filthy Souls (Keep the change, ya filthy animal.)  Both movies feature scenes at Chicago O'Hare's main terminal.  That damned lawn jockey gets knocked over repeatedly!  In both films, Kevin is initially scared of an old person who turns out to be nice. In the first it was the snow-shoveling man, in the second it was the bird lady in Central Park.

Its about a bunch of people with the same birthday showing up at a motel.  Perhaps someone will remember the name for me?  Anyway the parts that interested me wasd how the movie moved backwards explaining the story.  Once I got to thinking about it, I realized the past was being created on. the fly.  The steps that went back were created to explain the present.  As each step went backwards I soon understood that the events were not real but were created to fill on the gasps of the present.  None of it was real until a need came up to explain the events immedianetly following the creasted past.  Perhaps that is what you are doing?  While you are in the present you are creating a past that feels real to explain how you were aware of the current moment?

I'm no psychologist but I know that deja vu is caused by the brain misinterpreting the sensory information and instead of placing it in the temp folder, it places it into the long term folder. So it seems like you've already experienced this at one time before.   It could be a brain tumor, even though Schwarzenegger says otherwise. It could be something in your head whether physical or mental. It's probably not Lupus. I wouldn't even bother checking for that.   As for your friends calling you the prophet because you seemed to have proved that it's not your head but in fact a real thing, I'm not sure.   To move on to the out of the ordinary ""diagnosis"" I feel like maybe you're overworking this thing. Maybe you're not doing it on purpose but it might drive you insane if it always happens.

I don't really know exactly if it can be an advantage or anything tho. It's usually not my whole thought just a part of it. I find the easiest way to do it is picture someone you know and imagine them saying your name. Do that over and over and concentrate and it will be like they actually said it.   I also noticed the more you have actually heard what your thinking about it's easier to make yourself hear it. For example, my mother is always calling my name (like most mothers do) so it's easier for me to imagine my mother calling my name then some random person I know I don't usually hear say my name very often.   Also it works best if you are tired (probably why smoking marijuana makes this easier). I've come to think it's when you go into some sort of hypnotic state like mindlessly browsing reddit, driving, etc. people are always going in and out of different mental states. Kind of like day dreaming in a sort.   But I have noticed this for a while and I have started to actually focus on it. By doing this I can sort of do it on command if I am not distracted or there is no loud noises.   Maybe it will eventually be a way for humans to remember things better later down our evolutionary development."

There is no difference between thinking a song and hearing it. Since you cannot hear a song without thinking about the song you are hearing, the two acts are inseperable. Therefore there is no reason that the mental process alone should not produce the same perceptual effects. It is only a western prediliction for materialist philosophies which erroneously and ungraciously insists that hearing must be accompanied by external stimulation. Non-local phenomena account for a massive part of human consciousness. To become aware that a false dichotomy separates the two allows you to think in further dimensions. Embrace the dissonance and use it to express your own creative truths. Meaning of life and stuff like that."

Granted, you're talking about the morning, but if its early enough, it can be dark too.  that is my best attempt at a logical explanation, but the fact that it happened twice in a row and your hand was behind you is intriguing.   do you generally turn the light in a room off before or after you step through the doorway?  (In the above example, the light was off to begin with, but) I've been hitting the switch prior to leaving the doorway since many years ago, as I figured the few seconds each time I exit a room, over the course of my lifetime would add up to a substantial energy savings.   The point of that though, is, if you also flip the switch prior to or while passing through a doorway, was the light still on when you were ""back"" in the room, as if you'd never left, or was the light suddenly off, showing you indeed passed through the doorway?"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,355j3d,Electric_Balls,4,Thu May 7 07:46:58 2015 UTC,"I can relate, but I think you need to rethink some of your terminology.  Knowledge requires verifiable proof.   You can experience something without knowing it. You can feel something without knowing it. You can believe something without knowing it.   So if you are sitting on the couch one day, and you strongly see the image of a car crash in your mind's eye, and you feel strongly that this is going to happen, and you believe that this is about to happen, you do not know that it will happen. Because knowing, by its definition, requires verifiable data to support the claim. And you don't have that verifiable data.   Now suppose the car crash DOES happen. Did you know that it was going to happen? No, you didn't. You experienced something suggesting that it could/would/should happen. You believed that it could/would/should happen. You felt very strongly that it could/would/should happen. But you had no verifiable data proving that it would happen. So even if you predicted it, and you prediction was correct, you didn't know it. You experienced it, you believed it, you felt it, but you did not truly know it because the definition of knowledge had not been satisfactorily fulfilled according to the rigors of scientific inquiry.  Now, as long as you're not trying to make unscientific claims about what you know, you should be able to allow yourself to experience, feel, and believe things. Believing something without proof is unscientific, but as long as you understand that your belief is not scientific, you're not really conflicting with yourself. You're holding onto a belief based on your feelings, and feelings are not something that one can easily rationalize. So don't try to rationalize them."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,355j3d,UniversalChairs,1 point,Thu May 7 15:40:37 2015 UTC,I know it's unscientific. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Yet they happen. I do know these things. It doesn't make a lick of sense. That's what I'm struggling with.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,355j3d,UniversalChairs,2,Thu May 7 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that you're experiencing what you say, but it's not accurate to say that you know something without verifiable data. You'll be less internally conflicted if you stop insisting that you know these things and instead simply admit to yourself that you strongly believe these things.  I can see a rock on the ground, but I can't accurately say that I know there is a rock there until I've walked all around it, picked it up, analyzed it, and determined that it is not a piece of styrofoam or something else. Until I do that, all I can say is that I strongly believe there is a rock there."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,355j3d,UniversalChairs,2,Thu May 7 16:29:19 2015 UTC,The thing is what we're talking about isn't scientific. The entire concept is impossible in the eyes of modern science. I get what you're saying but i don't know that the scientific definitions of words can be used with this subject. Do you kind of see where I'm coming from?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,355j3d,UniversalChairs,1 point,Thu May 7 16:32:29 2015 UTC,Yes. Do you understand why it is inaccurate to say that you know something without verifiable data?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,355j3d,UniversalChairs,1 point,Thu May 7 16:34:27 2015 UTC,I do. That's the point of this post.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,355j3d,shadowjack00,1 point,Thu May 7 16:36:22 2015 UTC,"There is nothing unscientific about saying that you have a hunch about something, that you have a strong feeling about something, that you believe you've perceived something. Because none of those things require proof. They are simply descriptions of what you subjectively experienced.   Subjective experience is not the same thing as knowledge, nor does it have to be.  The only part where you conflict with science is when you claim to know something without proof.   If you say ""I had a vision of a car crash, so I believe that a car crash is likely to occur"" then you still are not violating any principle of science. You had the subjective experience of perceiving something. That subjective experience does not require verifiable data, because you're not claiming that it is ""knowledge,"" you're only claiming that it is what you perceived. So at that point, there is still nothing scientifically impossible happening there.  If you say ""I believe a crash is likely to occur based on what I perceived"" that doesn't necessarily require verifiable data, because you have not claimed certainty that the crash will occur, you have qualified your statement that the crash is something you believe will happen. Again, belief does not necessitate verifiable data. Believing something is simply a statement of subjective confidence in something. It is not the same thing as knowledge.  No matter how strongly you believe in something, you cannot truly know something without verifiable data.   If you cannot verify your belief with data, then you do not know it. You believe it. Now, just because you believe something that you cannot definitively proove, that doesn't mean it's false. It could be true. But it is not in the realm of the verifiable, thus it cannot be said to be something you know. It is something that you believe."

When I was young, there was no internet and our library didn't cover stuff like that. So I thought I was somehow special. Now I know that a lot of these things can very well happen and the probability that we are all connected through a mesh of [something] will eventually be proven.  Quantum Mechanics is getting closer and closer to be an explanation. What I was going to say is, that these things are supposed to be felt. We don't just think with our brains but large parts of neurons are connected with our guts too [hence gut-feeling].  Never ignore your gut-feeling, it is much older than the relatively 'new' grey matter. I wanted you to come out with more than that one story because it wasn't very telling.  Read up on the ""Quantum Brain"" or books such as ""The Holographic Universe"" and things will make more sense. We have lost a lot of abilities due to electronic noise and propaganda to think only in this realm.  When I said I am not 100% sure it is due to the fact that there could be a possibility that previous experiences sometimes also play a big part. For example do you know anyone who had an accident and then get scared when you think about your mum - sort of thing.  I am saying that that whilst I had a lot of weird things like that happen, I discard the times when I was worried or intuitive but nothing came of it.  We just don't know for sure yet. But I am inclined to think that telepathy, empathy etc are actual natural functions, that just haven't been proven yet."

Usually posts in this subreddit consist of a reasonably detailed report of a specific unusual experience. Everyone then offers their ideas and theories.  You've just said ""I just know stuff that happens elsewhere"".  Then you said:   I dont owe you every single occurrence and i won't type them all out. I did this for me, not you.   Well, if you want some insight then you do have to type some out.  This stuff isn't exactly entirely unheard of. Precog dreams and intuitions, just having an ""insight"" that something is happening and later finding out that it did, etc. But unless you give us specific examples, then you've not really nailed it down, and readers can't offer anything.  Putting that aside: I wouldn't worry about it. If you experience something, then it's not impossible. It is simply useful, or not. We don't even have a decent model for how our perceptual spaces work so everything's up for grabs really.  I actually think you're making too big a deal of it. ;-)"

This is from wiki:   A variety of tests have been performed to demonstrate telepathy, but there is no scientific evidence that the power exists.[7][62][63][64] A panel commissioned by the United States National Research Council to study paranormal claims concluded that ""despite a 130-year record of scientiﬁc research on such matters, our committee could ﬁnd no scientiﬁc justiﬁcation for the existence of phenomena such as extrasensory perception, mental telepathy or ‘mind over matter’ exercises... Evaluation of a large body of the best available evidence simply does not support the contention that these phenomena exist.""[65] The scientific community considers parapsychology a pseudoscience.[66][67][68][69] There is no known mechanism for telepathy.[70] Mario Bunge has written telepathy would contradict laws of science and the claim that ""signals can be transmitted across space without fading with distance is inconsistent with physics"".[71]   The physicist John Taylor has written the experiments that have been claimed by parapsychologists to support evidence for the existence of telepathy are based on the use of shaky statistical analysis, poor design and attempts to duplicate such experiments by the scientific community have failed. Taylor also wrote the arguments used by parapsychologists for the feasibility of such phenomena are based on distortions of theoretical physics as well as ""complete ignorance"" of relevant areas of physics.[72]  Psychologist Stuart Sutherland wrote that cases of telepathy can be explained by people underestimating the probability of coincidences. According to Sutherland ""most stories about this phenomenon concern people who close to one another - husband and wife or brother and sister. Since such people have much in common, it is highly probable that they will sometimes think the same thought at the same time.""[73]  Outside of parapsychology, telepathy is generally explained as the result of fraud, self-delusion and/or self-deception and not as a paranormal power.[6][74] Psychological research has also revealed other explanations such as confirmation bias, expectancy bias, sensory leakage, subjective validation and wishful thinking.[75] Virtually all of the instances of more popular psychic phenomena, such as mediumship, can be attributed to non-paranormal techniques such as cold reading.[76][77] Magicians such as Ian Rowland and Derren Brown have demonstrated techniques and results similar to those of popular psychics, without paranormal means. They have identified, described, and developed psychological techniques of cold reading and hot reading.  Here's the link if you're bothered"

I'm not sure I could list all my pants from memory-- but if most of your pants are matched to suits, maybe you could use the jackets as a guide to jog your memory.    My theories:    Your wife was cheating on you, guy leaves in a panic (probably not the windows...), can't find his pants and grabs a pair of yours knowingly or accidentally puts on a pair of your pants, leaves.  Wife finds his actual pants later, like maybe stuffed between the bed and wall, or under the bed... somewhere it could have been kicked or something accidentally, and then not found.  She thinks they're your black pants and hangs them up. A thief could have broken in one day when you were out, or maybe a friend you had over pretended to use the bathroom, came in your room, stole a pair of pants and left theirs. You or your wife were doing laundry and leaving with clean clothes, saw this pair on the floor, assumed they were yours that had just dropped, and folded and put them away.   I have no supernatural theories for this one.  Where did you find your actual pants?"

I had fallen asleep while driving. I was going 70mph with the cruise control on. I feel asleep and when I awoke, I was going in the area between the overpass and the off ramp. I swerved a couple of times before my car hit a small reflector pole, coming to a stop facing the opposite way. I had only a small dent on the passenger side door and a couple of scratches there. I was fine but very shaken up. If I had gone just one second more, I would have gone down to the highway below. I had always joked that I should have died then.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,351o04,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat May 9 08:42:46 2015 UTC,"I thought about this same thing :)  But if the date was after the accident, wouldn't that mean OP had the accident and then wrote in the journal?

That's the only rule. All OP has is a memory that differs. If the journal said in it ""yawn, woke up in this-particular-apartment-on-this-date"" and that from his rent receipts, that would be different.  The rule seems to be: Having an accident or a shift in some sense ""loosens the world"", and - like hypnogogia leading to a dream - it reassembles based on the patterns you have ""held onto"" on an as-experienced basis.  Musing - Your entire experience could shift right now, you could suddenly find yourself in a different room with a different job, and it would from that moment on be entirely self-consistent as a world. You'd never be able to find evidence of your previous situation, etc. It would be a ""fresh moment"" with a whole world that comes with it. Meanwhile, your realise that your own memories are memories of your personal sequence of moments rather than memories of the history of a world.  EDIT: The simpler way to say all that is: ""At some point his world respawned on him. In the fresh version, he'd had that dream at a different time. However,  since your personal memories don't seem to shift in alignment with the respawn, or at least not entirely, he only realised this when he looked at the notebook later."""

It's a forced and extreme version of something we can do ourselves, I guess. If there is a way to make a glitch happen, it's by withdrawing our hold on sensory experience to let the corresponding patterns shift?   And of course, you could apply this to every individual moment.   Right, every moment shiny new. That's an integral part of various traditional teachings. From a random search:   Although variously described, all of the world’s wisdom traditions regard the universe as being dynamically regenerated—arising as a fresh creation at every moment. The insight that we live in a universe that is continuously arising anew as a unified whole is found in all of the world’s major spiritual traditions—Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Indigenous traditions, and more.  --The Buddha Awakening, Science and Nonduality   You can get a sense of the ""transparency"" of the present moment (it's lack of a solid substrate). If you have a pain somewhere in your body, instead of fighting it or manipulating your body, just rest your attention with it - ""sit beside it"". You'll find it to be ""empty' and it will dissolve. Try this with other aspects of experience, and you'll get the same result. There is no ""solidity"" to this sensory moment. And no sense that an underlying, extended world supports it.  EDIT: Actually, I recommend that article in its entirety; it describes ""moments"" really well."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,351o04,TriumphantGeorge,2,Tue May 12 05:56:22 2015 UTC,"Gonna read that article. And actually, that's how I learned to deal with extreme pain. I found that ""getting to know it"" is better than trying to fight it. Well, when I set my mind to it.   If there is a way to make a glitch happen, it's by withdrawing our hold on sensory experience to let the corresponding patterns shift?   Gives me an idea - here's how to instigate a glitch. Since psychadelics theoretically loosen our hold on reality, the test subject should take a relatively large does of a psychadelic while also creating a new revision/intention in their world. And we can see if that sticks. Although it may only manifest in that person's reality. But it would be a start at something reproducible.  Perhaps this is why psychadelics can help with addictions and traumatic abuse. They loosen then mental ""death-grip"" our minds have on the current version of reality and allow intended revisions to take place."

Anything that expands your attention and shakes your habitual formatting a bit.   It highlights that unusual experience are a matter of allowing them in, perhaps. They are already there; you are just widening the the number of ""permitted event-types"".  If we want to do glitches, I say synchronicity is the way. Anyone can begin by proving it to themselves (invoke The Owls Of Eternity). Having satisfied ourselves personally first, then a collective endeavour can follow. This prevents the ""can't prove it to those who don't want it prove"" problem. We have preselected people who are willing to generate-allow the experience.

For example, a philosophical zombie could be poked with a sharp object, and not feel any pain sensation, but yet, behave exactly as if it does feel pain (it may say ""ouch"" and recoil from the stimulus, or tell us that it is in intense pain).  The notion of a philosophical zombie is used mainly in thought experiments intended to support arguments (often called ""zombie arguments"") against forms of physicalism such as materialism, behaviorism and functionalism. Physicalism is the idea that all aspects of human nature can be explained by physical means: specifically, all aspects of human nature and perception can be explained from a neurobiological standpoint. Some philosophers, like David Chalmers, argue that since a zombie is defined as physiologically indistinguishable from human beings, even its logical possibility would be a sound refutation of physicalism.  However, physicalists like Daniel Dennett counter that Chalmers's physiological zombies are logically incoherent and thus impossible.

So, please do correct me if I'm wrong, I'm trying to get a better understanding of it, myself.    Isn't it thought that all possibilities exist simultaneously?  So, if that were to be true, wouldn't there also have to be a possible reality that exists where you did, in fact, remember this event which caused your death?  It would be a very rare occurrence, I understand, though it would still have to exist for it all to be true, right?

It's logically impossible to remember a death that you did not experience - only the dead version of you experienced that death, and they no longer exist.   People's understanding of the concept is muddied by the long-standing belief in a 'soul'. This is why threads like this are full of terms along the lines of 'waking up in a new life' and 'shifting to a different reality'.   It is not a matter of your consciousness moving from one life to another, but only existing where there is a cause (a you) for it to exist.  Things become even more mind-bending when you imagine time as a singular whole. Across all time and all realities, we both exist within and do not exist within. This lines up with our current understanding of quantum mechanics and the effect of observation, which I'm sure your husband would do a better job of explaining."

It looks like no one here actually understands QI.  The way the Many Worlds Interpretation works is that every time a new quantum interaction takes place, a new ""world"" (systems with correlated quantum states) splits partially off the old one; 'partially' because it's limited by how that information is transmitted (see the 'Wigner's Friend' corollary to Schroedinger's Cat).  In QI, the same thing happens. When the system called ""your body"" interacts with and becomes correlated with the system called ""poison vial"" or ""out of control truck"", the systems go into superposition and you become dead in one part of the outcome and alive in another.  And it's not anything to do with the decisions you make - it happens every time quantum information is created through interactions. Every second there are quadrillions of ""yous"" splitting into alternate, equally real, worlds.  So, let's say you decide to get into a QI suicide booth. Every second that's going by, zillions of you are being created. (And don't go thinking you're special here. Don't imagine you at the middle with alternayous splitting away. You are just another branch from a younger you.) By being in the booth, you constrain any future yous to worlds were the quantumly improbable has occured: the vial didn't smash. There's no ""there"" there until you get there. And when you do, you're as much you and you normally are. The millions of you that walk out of the booth (at slightly different times and with subtlely different quantum states - heat distribution, say) will all remember being the same single individual you that walked in. ALL of them will be ""the real you"".   This in no way requires physicalism, by any means. But it does mean that the soul/mind/aenima vitae/what-have-you, if such exists, is similarly fractally fractious. It has nothing to do with p-zombies (or 'zimbos' - the term I always preferred) - you don't need to animate a preexisting body, you just create a new one, like you always do. Questions of identity and free will become radically changed - ie. ""Yes, there's some world out there where Mother Teresa snapped and gunned down a marketplace. But those worlds are very rare compared to the ones where she tried to help people"". And note: this is a little different than Egan's ""Dust"" perspective, which would allow zimbo animation if it was an effective way to maintain an internally consistent world, but the OP was explicitly asking about QI. (Of course, both systems may be operative. I suspect they are, frankly.)  Tl;dr - you don't 'go' to a new universe when you survive, you create it. And this is a normal and common thing to happen."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,350f6v,stunspot,1 point,Wed May 6 02:38:24 2015 UTC,"Nicely put!  Generally, I think these descriptions are slightly better without the quantum mechanics element - it is enough that there are multiple ""experience-sets"" and that what your are is not identified with any one of them.   The temporal-bound idea of things actually splitting in time, rather than being there, confuses things, since it is a view from ""inside"", just as the idea of states and interactions are, when the view from ""outside"" is more akin to an eternal structure or pattern in which all possibilities are available equally.   But, y'know, details. There are a hundred ways of saying the same thing in different terminology, and of holding one part ""stable"" while describing the movements of the other parts!"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,350f6v,TriumphantGeorge,2,Wed May 6 07:03:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd have to disagree, actually. There's lots of different scientific theories and perspectives that have similar features, but important differences as well as differing amounts of evidence. There's also a lot of philosophical/religious sytems that say something similar, but have no evidence and are, frankly, nonsense. The MWI which underlies the Quantum Immortality thought experiment says some very specific things about how the universe works and is extremely well tested - any physicist who thinks it correct won't be considered bonkers by his peers."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,350f6v,stunspot,1 point,Wed May 6 07:54:38 2015 UTC,"Currently (speaking as a former physicist) the many-worlds interpretation is just one of several dubious interpretations of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is basically a mathematical description the makes predictions. It works. The ""what it means"" has been up for grabs for a long time. Even the idea of it being ""probabilities"" is itself an interpretation. (Without a hidden variables-based view, it quickly becomes un-think-out-able except as a mathematics-inspired fantasy, and our passion for locality presents a hurdle.) Max Born took a very ""it's just the maths"" view of the whole endeavour.  Quantum Immortality is not a scientific theory, it is a (fine) philosophical meandering extrapolated from this. It cannot be ""proved"" because by the very nature of it, it comes ""before"" science. There is no evidence for it; it's basically unfalsifiable. But that's okay, because what we are trying to describe is conscious experience here, to provide an ""explanatory fiction"" for certain people's subjective anecdotes, not something that can be observed objectively.  This is a good article on the general background. There's an article in the April2015 edition of New Scientist worth a look, but it's based on this work. Short version: QM is maths, used but not understood, and people are still trying to come up with understandable physics from it even now (and the axioms used in that approach are just as arbitrary and unfounded as anything that came before).  EDIT: Sorry, that sounded a bit snippy! But the circularity of talking about jumping worlds based on observations that take place within one of those worlds is confused. It's fine to take the possible idea of ""hey there are different possibilities existing at once, we could flip between them"", but to say that is the actual nature of things behind the scenes is a bit of a stretch."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,350f6v,TriumphantGeorge,3,Wed May 6 08:03:31 2015 UTC,"i like to think of it all like effervescent bubbles in water, each one being the different parallel realities, as bubbles collapse and merge into larger more demanding bubbles, so do realities. Small differences in vastly similar universes crash together in an effort to simplify the multiverse, you are aware of you and you only because we are constantly, through choices our own and of others, cause them to get too close and bam, merge.  It isnt saying that the others are different you, more so than you are just you. It is as natural a step as breathing, or the tides. Drastic choices split different branches of reality, and as the energy of their creation wanes, they fuse back together with the winning outcome.   Sure there may be a reality out there where I am in a drastically different location than i am now, and of the realities where I am there, something bad may happen to me, or not. If I am meant to be immortal then this version of me typing this out will either remain away from that event, or its just for all i know, a figment of my imagination.

The answer, in a nutshell, is this: There is no ""you"" in the other universe, at least no conscious ""you."" Your consciousness is overtaking a philosophical zombie.  To explain I need you to think about driving in the car. You're going down a road that you've driven every day for the last two years. You know its ins and outs, you know where the speed limit changes, you know where to slow down because animals like to cross.   Now, think of a time where, while driving down that road, you sort of blink and realize that you can't remember driving the last mile or so. You obviously drove that part, since you're beyond it, and you obviously did it well, because you're not in a flaming wreck on the side of the road and you don't have a ticket, but you weren't consciously aware of the actual process. Perhaps you were zoning out, perhaps you were deep in thought, perhaps you were jamming to the music. Whatever the case, you just successfully drove a stretch of road while not paying attention.  This is what is known as a philosophical zombie. Your consciousness is not the same thing as your mind, as your body can take in extremely complicated stimuli, such as encountered while driving, and respond to it all correctly, all while you are not actually paying attention.  There are some who think that some people just walk around their whole lives as philosophical zombies. It's hard to say one way or the other, because people act the same whether or not they are conscious or a philosophical zombie.  Which leads us back to your question. My guess would be that, in the case of a quantum immortality jump, you are shifting over into the life of a philosophical zombie version of yourself. Perhaps everyone only has one consciousness, and we are constantly navigating multiple realities through quantum immortality. Who knows?"

As for what makes this universe special? I have no idea. For all you know, this universe might be special just because it happened to be what your consciousness chose."

For example, a philosophical zombie could be poked with a sharp object, and not feel any pain sensation, but yet, behave exactly as if it does feel pain (it may say ""ouch"" and recoil from the stimulus, or tell us that it is in intense pain).  The notion of a philosophical zombie is used mainly in thought experiments intended to support arguments (often called ""zombie arguments"") against forms of physicalism such as materialism, behaviorism and functionalism. Physicalism is the idea that all aspects of human nature can be explained by physical means: specifically, all aspects of human nature and perception can be explained from a neurobiological standpoint. Some philosophers, like David Chalmers, argue that since a zombie is defined as physiologically indistinguishable from human beings, even its logical possibility would be a sound refutation of physicalism.  However, physicalists like Daniel Dennett counter that Chalmers's physiological zombies are logically incoherent and thus impossible.

So I spent some time hunting this book down.  I just pulled out the book from my daughter's bookshelf, and it's like the cover completely changed from when I had purchased it TWO YEARS AGO.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34w8y2,haenger,4,Tue May 5 08:06:55 2015 UTC,"I am really glad that your life turned around completely. I mean it.  [note: all this is just my philosophical ranting, not entirely related to this post]  I am also suicidal and depressed due to medical issues and my looks. Neither can be helped. This just makes me wanna kill myself even more. The only way for me and for millions of others to ever be happy is if there's something more after this life, something much better. I am not much of a believer in an afterlife, but I can't deny its existence entirely. There are also great arguments for existence of the supernatural, although we cannot know the nature of that supernatural realm.   I just wish this pain would stop. I have prayed [despite my atheism] to some 'higher being' for the last year, daily, for hours to relieve some of my pain, to make me healthy, even if for a few months. Nothing has happened.  I don't know what to believe. I don't understand why life has to be so cruel [if you think it isn't, you're incredibly privileged, and I'm happy for you. But it's very painful for many, many of us] if some higher power exists.   Sometimes I think all this evil and suffering HAS to be intentional. Which either means that an evil higher power exists [""satan"" or even god of old testament/koran who are both evil], or that a 'god' exists who has created suffering so that our happiness in some heavenly afterlife would be multiplied after suffering so much on earth. Like drinking after days of thirst. I really hope there isn't some evil monster who burns people in hell forever out there. That scares me too much. Because death is the only good thing about a painful life. A certain escape. On the other hand, eternal suffering is incomprehensibly evil.  I guess I'm near the end of the dark tunnel and still there's no light. There's a cliff, however, and I'm thinking of jumping off it very soon. I hope there's something good waiting for me afterwards. For my sake and for everyone else's. I wish the person I love also ends up happy in life and afterwards. He deserves it so much. Even the thought of him growing old, suffering and dying and not existing anymore makes my heart hurt. It's too much.  These are all wishes, though. Probably we are just in a dark, meaningless universe and death is all there is. You suffer, you die. Such a tragedy. Such a waste. It's infinitely evil. evil. evil. evil. This cannot be understated."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34w8y2,Walksonthree,3,Tue May 5 14:05:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a higher power. If there were, it would be some sort of ""Librarian"" who is there to help us ""readers"" have the experiences we want.   When you die - which is a result of getting into a situation which doesn't have an obvious next-moment - I think you just switch discontinuously into another experience. That might be one where you suddenly avoided the car crash somehow; it might be you have some sort of other-world experience; it might be that you switch to experiencing being born again.  Current metaphor: The Hall of Records  Imagine that you are a conscious being exploring a Hall of Records for this world.  You are connecting to a vast memory bank containing all the possible events, from all the possible perspectives, that might have happened in a world like this.  Like navigating through an experiential library.   And there may be any number of customers perusing the records. So this is not solipsism: Time being meaningless in such a structure, we might say that ""eventually"" all records will be looked-through, and so there is always consciousness experiencing the other perspectives in a scene.   At the same time, this allows for a complex world-sharing model where influence is permitted, because ""influencing events"" simply means navigating from one 3D sensory record to another, in alignment with one's intention.  This process of navigation could be called remembering. Practically, this would involve summoning part of a record in consciousness and having it auto-complete by association. This would be called recall. You can observe something like this ""patterned unfolding"" occurring in your direct conscious experience right now.  I do like the idea that we might one day develop a Library Guide for Researchers which would help us all navigate this stuff more easily. The extrapolated version of this (we need to answer, ""how do we select the memory records""?) would end up being something similar to this, perhaps.  In other words... it sounds like you have had an incredibly tough time, but that doesn't mean you are doomed to have a tough time ""forever""."

However, the idea that this metaphor evokes - that you are experiencing this life, this moment, but what you are is not equivalent to this life - is valid. This just provides an accessible way to think about it. (Previous versions of such ""eternal"" structures or ""static universes"" are a bit of a slog to wade through. JW Dunne and his The Serial Universe and An Experiment with Time, and Julian Barbour's The End of Time, for instance.)  The true takeaway is this: That if we are making assumptions about ""what happens next"" or ""what the purpose is"" based on the everday evidence of the senses, it is likely incorrect or at least incomplete. The stories on this subreddit suggest that the larger picture is more subtle. I think there is a case for optimism."

I'm not afraid of looking at that in the dark.  Also, one of the comments in the DAE thread linked to an article on a study of the strange-face effect; I found that very interesting. Look straight into a mirror with only a dim light behind you, and your face appears to change.

I think we come into this world with various gifts, and two guides. The mind believes its Number One job is to see us through this 3-D world.  It doesn't care that any other world exists, and so will never explore the possibilities until we ask for a map.  If we wish, we can certainly go through this entire incarnation without asking for that map. Or we can take someone else's map. But if we seriously want to venture there, we have to try, even if only just for funsies, to consider how a ""Universe"" must be structured in order to allow these ""preposterous and impossible"" glitches to occur. (Because as we here are fond of pointing out, they DO occur)  Give the mind free reign and it will continue to spew forth all sorts of possibilities. The second guide, the Heartmind, knows that its job is to help to filter the sense and nonsense and tell us what is true. Subtle though they may be, its warmings and coolings, its flowerings, and witherings, are signs along the path that ultimately leads to the metaphorical gateless gate of the Zen Koan."

Sometimes it will be a missed call from a cell number and I'll call it back with no answer.  They'll call back and I'll have to tell them they got the wrong number, this is no longer Bill's cell phone number.  A few times they have said they called the number by accident.  Many seem to be surprised when someone actually answers.  I decided to google this guy and found out that he passed away shortly before I got his old cell number.  I wonder if some of these people aren't pocket dialing and/or calling to hear his voice on the voicemail, only to have a call returned from deceased Bill's cell number."

It was made available after his phone line was disconnected, something which they usually do after someone passes away.  It was then reassigned to me by my cellphone company when I switched over to them.  So, since your mom still had his number stored in her phone, it is very likely that she accidentally called it (pocket-dial, etc.).  Then the person who now has his cellphone number returned the missed phone call.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34x4l4,mrarroyo,6,Wed May 6 05:10:46 2015 UTC,"The main issue I have with this is belief is that it encourages the believer to deny individuality to people, and encourages you to reduce people down into stereotypes.  If I have the same physical build as another man, and we wear the same clothing, are you really comfortable with assuming that he and I share the same identical values and ideas?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34x4l4,UniversalChairs,0,Tue May 5 16:46:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you have similar tastes in clothing and style it means you have the same or similar perspective and perception on desires. This is why friends tend to dress at least similar, because they share the same tastes in things.   The same physical build itself does not necessarily mean you think alike, however having the same muscular build might mean you both go to the gym, which is another thing you have in common. If you're heavy into cardio and look like a runner, I'm putting money that you might be a runner. And if someone has a similar body style I'm willing to bet they might do the same.   Therfore if someone stood next to you with the same outfit and same body build, I would definitely be more inclined to say/assume that you have the same views on things and same tastes on things. HOWEVER, not everyone is identical or coincidentally similar to a T. Maybe your views differ on a few specific subjects but based on how you look alone, I can generally get a good feeling on what you prioritize. Also taking into consideration tone of voice and body language.  I can say that this sort of stereotypical assumption has not failed me yet, but I am pretty careful about it too."

But if you judged me based purely on who I remind you of, you'd be making all sorts of assumptions.  You can't tell from looking at me whether I'm religious or not. You can't tell from looking at me whether I'm straight, gay, or bisexual, pansexual, or any other orientation. I could be any, judging from appearances alone.  You can't tell from looking at me whether I'm pragmatic or idealistic, solipsistic or materialistic, truly genuine or just a really good actor.  You could tell whether I'm self confident or insecure.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34vucz,churito69,8,Mon May 4 23:56:53 2015 UTC,I'm in the UK and have a very similar story about seeing an advertisement apparently transmitted from the future. Definitely not the same one you describe but it was about 25 years ago. IIRC the presenter said it was their first attempt at doing this and they hoped it had worked. It looked very expensively produced and had some special effects in it. Like he was walking through some modern open plan office building with different levels and glass partitions with the camera floating through the space. What I thought strange was that I couldn't work out what they were advertising. They had spent all this money and there was no obvious product or service. It was never on again but my friend also saw it at his house. Who would pay for something like that if it just some kind of prank?

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34vucz,falling_into_fate,0,Fri May 8 15:13:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know but I think that it is possible to send radio/television signals more than tangible stuff back in time, I just theorize since fiber optics came along then we can move information and signals at light speed maybe they will or can figure out a way to send it faster than light speed. Just because signals aren't as tangible as solid matter."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34vucz,harry1997,2,Sat May 9 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"signals and solid matter are pretty much the same thing. fiber optics are faster than traditional wires because they are transmitting photons instead of electrons. photons are weightless, electrons aren't. photons travel at the speed of light because they're weightless. it's E = mc2. the electrons move more slowly because they have mass, which means they can't reach the upper limit of the speed of light. there are a few theories on faster than light speed travel. one is based on tachyons, which are proposed particles which have negative mass. the others have nothing to do with particles, but are based on scrunching up spacetime, or ""drilling"" a wormhole through spacetime. the latter is more like teleportation, while the former is more like just moving really fast.  in any case, if they can find a way to transmit information using tachyons, then yes it would be easier to send signals back in time than to send solid matter back in time. if that's the method, then you're right. the other methods, however, would treat solid objects the same way as photons or electrons. if you've got a wormhole, there's basically no difference between throwing a message in a bottle into it, and emitting radio waves into it. it'll move through the wormhole at the same speed, because the distance from entrance to exist is literally zero. in other words, you'd be teleporting a physical object instantly, which is exactly how fast a photon would teleport."

I was involved in a after school program that would pick us up directly from school & drive us to the meeting hall. The meeting hall was the next town over, in the country- so it was a good distance to drive. The van was in the stretch between the towns were there is nothing but trees when I suddenly started to have a panic attack that my house was on fire. This was in the days before cell phones, so the driver promised me that she'd call my mom as soon as we got there. She called the house & it just rang- the machine didn't pick up. Of course, I was inconsolable at that point. So after the program we headed home, we hit the tree line (coming out of the trees into the clearing) on the edge of town & there is a huge column of smoke. I flipped. As the van heads towards my house it became clear to me that we were heading for the source of the smoke. We stopped just short of my house. There was a frickin' blockade, fire trucks, by standers & such- the house was on fire! Turns out, it was my neighbor's house, but omg, scary! I am glad your friend wasn't badly hurt."

Also, my ex-wife's birthday was one day after mine, yet she was older.  The reason for this is because my sister is one year and 11 months older than I am. And my ex-wife is 364 days older than I am.  Is it possible that you are 11 months older than your cousin? If that's the case, you are still older, even though his birthday is before yours in the year. That was a subject I struggled to understand when I was a kid.  EDIT: removed a superfluous ""but""."

I'm only offering a possible explanation for the confusion, considering that this is a case of something happening to children, and children are often confused.  In my case, my birthday was a month before my sister's, and I was confused about how she could be older than me if my birthday came before her's in the year. There were even times where, as a kid, I would tell my friends that my sister's birthday was a month after mine, and they would always ask ""but isn't she older than you?"" Kids get these things wrong all the time.  So all I'm saying is that it's possible that OP's birthday was always a month after his cousin's, but his easily-confused child mind assumed that because he was older his birthday HAD to come before his cousin's."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34pt6j,Lunchbox725,8,Sun May 3 16:39:36 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but that doesn't seem to address the confusion at all. If it were the case that his cousin was 11 months older, for example, the order of celebration would still say the same for any and all years. It wouldn't account for a switching of recognition of either of their birthdays, ever. It would remain consistent. Still confusing, but consistent nonetheless."

I can remember being a little confused when she was having a birthday party when we were maybe 7-8.  She was turning whatever age I was, but for some reason I couldn't wrap my brain around the fact that she was having a birthday because I hadn't yet had my birthday that calendar year (her birthday is in May, mine is in June, so I want to say she was turning 8 and I was turning 9 but during those two weeks where we have the same numerical age I was having trouble wrapping my brain around it).  I think this is the concept /u/UniversalChairs is discussing.  Something about the fact that the calendar year's birthday didn't seem to click well at that time, even though nothing actually changed.

But there are 10 dimensions in total, accounting for all of the other unseen quirks having to do with quantum entanglement and gravity leakage.  On top of that, M-Theory posits that there is an 11th dimension undergirding the previous 10.  According to M-Theory, this ""matrix computer"" as you put it is the entirety of the multiverse, existing in all 11 dimensions, containing a holographic representation of all possible universes.  Similar to how the bee's knowledge might be mapped onto a 6 dimensional quantum manifold, the entirety of the multiverse might be mapped onto an 11 dimensional quantum manifold.  I mean, the universe has a lot more going on inside of it than the limitations of what a honey bee might encounter."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34qccn,UniversalChairs,2,Sun May 3 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"Right, not saying 11 dimensions don't exist. Just that 6 dimensions can be theorized from glitch-type experiences without invoking obtuse mathematics.  I should say that I'm not a big fan of quantum mechanics. I'm not a physicist, but I have read up on the mathematical basis for it - the actual equations and reasoning behind it. I do believe QM is very accurate, but it seems to me that it spends a lot of time describing the minutae of reality without giving much insight into its nature. It's a lot of ""what"" without ""how"" or ""why"". But that's personal (perhaps ill informed) opinion."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34qccn,UniversalChairs,1 point,Sun May 3 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see what you're saying.  Unfortunately, most science can only ever attempt to explain the ""what"" and the ""how"" but rarely ever gets into the ""why"" because that would mean attributing meaning into existence, and that's a realm better suited to philosophy than to science."

You guys are right about how science cannot answer the ultimate why, however, just as a little history lesson, I'll note that what we regard as ""science"" today actually started as ""philosophy"" with the ancient Greeks. Initially philosophy sought to answer the question of why - as why is the world the way it is? Philosophy eventually split off into its own speciality (unfortunately, IMO) and does still try to answer the question of why while science takes care of the how and what."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34qccn,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Mon May 4 03:53:18 2015 UTC,"what we regard as ""science"" today actually started as ""philosophy""   that was my reasoning!  indeed; science originates from skey: to split, dissect; which would make ""philosophy"" an application of science"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34qccn,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Mon May 4 04:59:56 2015 UTC,"what we regard as ""science"" today actually started as ""philosophy""    And we used to call ourselves ""Natural Philosophers"". I actually think it's fairly recent, post-WWII, that science turned into basically ""applied science"" with a hobbled philosophical aspect.  If you read the essays and letters of the big physicists of the early 20th century, you'll see they entertained far more varied and interesting thoughts than they are given credit for.  (See the epilogue of Schrodinger's What is Life? lectures; Wolfgang Pauli's work with Jung; Einstein's letters.) The history and debate of physics has been dumbed down to the extent that people actually think these mystical explorations were ""misguided"", when in fact they are the very heart of what scientific investigation is about. Early 20th-century physicists were well aware of the distinction between models and ""the unbounded space of nature""; they were well aware that models are ""explanatory fictions"" and that things have arbitrary elements which precludes answering the question ""why?"".  We should also note that the ""scientific method"" is one approach to finding scientific knowledge, which was evolved by scientists for a particular purpose. It is not actually the approach or the definition of scientific endeavour, as it has come to be seen. It's just one tool in the search for ""observed regularities"" and the understanding of the nature of experience.  There are still plenty of interesting folk today, such as George Ellis or Basily Hiley (who worked with David Bohm), but these sorts of more philosophical takes have fallen into the background in the face of media-friendly math-hacks such as Stephen Hawking and others.  Note: Nothing wrong with mathematical descriptions, they capture relationships. The problem is that they lack visualisable concepts so they can never be understandable without a backing framework. When you push to far along that line, you eventually need to have a reconfiguration of your existing conceptual framework - e.g. introducing a persistent 4D space such that narrative coherence across time is not problematic / recognising that time-traversing sensory experience defines a partial observation but does not necessarily capture all contributing facts."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34qccn,crusoe,1 point,Mon May 4 05:57:59 2015 UTC,"media-friendly math-hacks such as Stephen Hawking and others.   You and I are so on the same page.  You probably know this already, but I think the turn away from scientific philosophical enquiry can be marked by the acceptance of Relativity and the turn away from Aether Theory, and was further derailed by the development of Quantum Theory. Not to say anything is necessarily wrong with these approaches, but scientists began to adopt the view that nature is fundamentally obscure and counterintuitive. Thus, the search for understanding the nature of Nature was abandoned, being seen as ultimately fruitless.  [The thing that pisses me off most is that the experiment that was the basis and empircal support for Special Relativity (Michelson-Morley) was rooted in an intuitive theory (Aether). It was at this point that intuitive understanding was rejected and paradox became the norm.]"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34qccn,UniversalChairs,1 point,Tue May 5 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, good points.   The move away from requiring that descriptions be understandable was a poor one. It later led to people introducing ""as real"" interpretations that we would not normally have gone for (""many worlds"" as presently described, etc) as patches.  Results may seem counterintuitive, the answer is then to formulate a description that allows them to fall within understandability again. This might mean we have to introduce additional structures (4D landscapes whatever), but they themselves should ""make sense"".  There is an extra bit though. Models that are helpful for ""personal reality management"" may not be the best models for ""shared reality management"", as it were. They should be linked, but there may be areas of ""we cannot say"" between the two.  And that's okay. The unwillingness of people to not-have-an-answer for a while, a temporary gap, is half the problem."

There are 4 large dimensions and 6 or 7 rolled up ones that are super tiny. The way a super string winds through the rolled up kaluza Klein geometry determines what particle it behaves as.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34n1vv,baby_star,16,Sat May 2 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting, and I wonder how often this actually happens.  One thing I always notice about these glitches is people who point out obvious solutions - look up past/historical records, etc. I think they have missed the obvious nature of a glitch; if they exist at all they are something that are inherently self-corrective in the nature of this reality. In other words, if there are past records, obviously the universe is going to correct those things, because it is the past itself which has actually been altered in some way. The problem is that the individual mind remains unaltered. Therefore it is the individual who is the ""glitch"", not the universe.  This always aggravates me when I read replies to glitches. The problem with any given glitch is, at least from my presumptive viewpoint, that the individual mind has somehow failed to conform to the Matrix. it is not that the Matrix has failed to conform to the individual mind. People saying ""just check X set of records or set of people"" are completely missing the idea of what a glitch actually is..."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34n1vv,TriumphantGeorge,3,Sun May 3 04:44:08 2015 UTC,"That is a really interesting viewpoint; I'm still learning all about this, but I feel that generally when people talk about glitches they mean that something within the universe has changed somehow and the individual has recognised it. Rarely does it seem that the individual them self is the glitch.  This story is utterly freaky to me; and if true, completely matches your viewpoint of the individual being the glitch as opposed to something up with the universe, such as deja vu."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34n1vv,emberfiend,2,Sun May 3 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's impossible to tell the two apart: all we can say is that the observer-facts and the world-facts now do not correspond, for the observer.  If an ""objective"" change-point in the world-facts or in the observer-facts could be found, it wouldn't be a glitch. Glitches always mean narrative coherence is obeyed."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34m7qy,fionaharris,59,Sun May 3 10:27:02 2015 UTC,"Pretty amazing story! I do Reiki, and when I was getting my first degree, my teacher pulled me aside and told me that I was blocked, and that she had to do some healing on me or else I wouldn't be able to heal anyone.   She sat me down beside her in the corner of the room, and took my hand and started gently stroking it. Very quickly, I started feeling intense heat in my entire body. I can't explain the feeling- it was almost like I was a kettle that was boiling! Tears started pouring from my eyes, and the worst thing was that horrendous amounts of snot started pouring from my nose!! It was literally running down to my chin and down onto my chest! Sweat was coming from everywhere!  When she was done, I felt very drained, but in a good way. I went to bed that night and could barely sleep-every single joint in my body crackled! If I moved, I could hear and feel what seemed to be 'crystals' just crunching and breaking apart.  I had the runs the next day, and pretty much felt like I had the flu- called in sick for work for a day or so, runny nose, coughing-she said that that would happen, that I would be releasing toxins, etc.  I have been doing Reiki for nearly 20 years, and I've had some amazing experiences, but I think that my teacher was something very special-I've never had a client react the way that I did.  The premise with any kind of energy healing is that the person is  channeling energy (or perhaps using their own), and that it goes through them and into you, allowing your body to use it where it's needed.   I would have gone immediately and started taking that guys meditation course- though you were only 20, so maybe there was a natural lack of maturity and it just wasn't part of your plan at that time.

I'm speaking from a somewhat informed background. I grew up in a family very much in the medical profession, studied science and medicine in school, really bought i to the whole ""scientific method"" school of thought. But as I've gotten older, I've discovered that a lot of what science said was good or correct (about our bodies in particular) was just people's opinions speaking from very narrow areas of research. I've since dropped depending on what science says to do, and I've been healthier (and happier) than ever.

The understanding of it could come quicker if pursuing these sorts of endeavors becomes something you do in earnest, as the type of growth necessary to do so will, as a consequence of your efforts, probably come quicker as well.  It may help, somewhat, to flip your perspective. Consider that you were given a glimpse of something, some aspect of true human potential, that most humans would not be privy to until they were much further along.  You're left with unanswered questions, and that is highly unsatisfying. On the other hand, a window of knowledge was opened for you. Perhaps because the teacher just felt like strutting, or perhaps because he saw that you were further along than you are aware. Someone who would make productive use of this tiny glimpse.

The reasoning tends to be something along the lines of seeing energetic phenomenon along with other non-normal phenomenon as distractions along the spiritual path.  One person described it as 90 degrees to the spiritual path, so that if you become infatuated only with energetic phenomena and/or with what some call the realm of powers then you'll never come any ""closer"" to enlightenment. However if you're following a good teacher's instruction you'll be going in the right direction, and possibly gain access to this weird stuff along the way.  The common view tends to be that if this type of thing is interesting to you, to first pursue practices directly related to enlightenment, and then afterwards to get into energetic phenomena or the realm of powers. Otherwise this stuff can become something you fixate on, become ornamentation to your ego, and maybe even be a way you crash your karma (in other words it can be a way that you make a very bad situation for yourself).

Giving proof that there's something beyond the veil defeats the purpose of the veil, and can be a disservice.  Therefore, all proof that is given is non-transitive - subjective - so that the person who desired proof, and is ready, can experience it, and let it inform their actions; and yet, so that the free will of others is respected, so that people who don't wish to know don't have to know.  You can decide for yourself whether you wish to know. If you do wish to know, in due course, you will receive subjective evidence, of such a nature that it will be good enough to convince you; yet, it won't be good enough for you to use it to convince those others who do not yet wish to know."

Mountains could have a different giant text carved into them on an hourly basis, and so on.  What is more difficult to do is to convey more than an approximation, more than a poor representation of what experiences might exist outside the sim. Or to convince those in the sim that you're not lying or misrepresenting what exactly is outside the sim."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34m7qy,NewAlexandria,2,Sun May 3 07:11:29 2015 UTC,"Right. Although I was speaking more from the perspective of the typical player as opposed to an omnipotent GM. And actually, if you think about it, the GM still has to play by the code written into the game. For example, the GM could appear anywhere, but that's because the physics of the game allow it. i.e. there is no matter/energy conservation inherent to the game. For a more stringent set of rules, a GM could still teleport somewhere, but necessary consequences would follow such as explosions or annihilations or such. These interactions would be used to explain the non-supernatural origin of the GM event.  Anyway, yes, I do agree on your point though. Representation is difficult or perhaps impossible."

My bf has a friend who went to Tibet for what was supposed to be a year, but turned into 4 years- he ended up in a Buddhist monastery doing menial chores and meditating. He came back to Calgary and was part of the Buddhist temple here. When he had kids, and his kids were in their teens, they had a Buddhist monk come over for some kind of event. The monk was an old friend and came over for supper. The friend had this big waterfall in his living room, and in the base of it was a bunch of river rocks.   His 17 year old son was being a little mouthy and questioning the validity of one of his dad's stories of his time in the monastery (he told everyone that the monks would put their hands over a pile of wood and start the wood on fire).  The Buddhist monk got annoyed, and told the kid to pick up a river rock and hold it in this hand. He did so, and the monk put his hands over the kids (not touching), and the rock heated up in his hands so fast that it burnt his hand really badly! The kid screamed and dropped the rock, and was left with a badly burned palm, which turned into a scar that he still has to this day (he is in his 30s now).   I get that you don't want to be mocked, but isn't there a better way to 'prove' something? Set a napkin on fire.. don't burn a kids hand!"

But I'm not too hung up on the details like that, because obviously no one shrunk down into a tiny mass that slid underneath the oven either, because it was a dream.  So let me say something about the limitations of what I experienced. I do not think that my dream was some form of remote viewing. I don't think that I dreamt of a real thing that happened.  I think that while I was dreaming, my mind managed to pick up on the concept of a stabbing coming from my sister's mind, at the moment that she witnessed it.

Strange story about synchronicity, I'm sure you have all got the feeling every now and then that you have seen or lived something before. For those of you who've not experienced synchronicity, a synchronic alignment is much like a déjà vu feeling but multiply it a hundred times.   The last few weeks have been quite tough due to university and things, when I feel overwhelmed I pray to the God and the Goddess and ask for guidance or solace. My life as of late has been quite rife with hardship and strife, I found all of it was getting too much so I lit the candles on my shrine, made an offering, then asked for some sort of peace of mind or assurance that I'm doing the right thing and walking the right path. It felt like I was lost in the twisted, gnarled, and dark forest we call life and this troubled me because I normally have a clear picture of where I am and what I need to do.  I finished my prayers, went to bed, then got up and headed to work worrying because I hadn't had a sign that I was walking the road I was suppose to. I was flicking through my satellite radio channels then something happened to the connection and I couldn't get any sound. This has never happened to me before, I figured something happened to the radios power connection and I was angry that it was another thing in my life that had went wrong and I was going to have to fix.   I switched the the CBC and the broadcaster was talking about troubles in life and how the night is darkest before the dawn to set up an indie set list. I didn't think anything of it when he was talking, but when the first song played the writer sung about how hectic life was and sometimes all you need was to slow down, take it easy, and trust that whatever force is guiding you will help you through.   I go to school full time and I work an overnight job where we aren't allowed to sleep on shift, needless to say I run myself ragged constantly, Suddenly I had that déjà vu feeling but it was so intense it was like a high, my body filled with happiness and I smiled and laughed, shaking my head. Realizing what the broadcaster had said and how perfectly it was timed.   The next day I got home and thanked the God and the Goddess and promised them I would slow myself down and take it easy. Then I said that if I'm going to do that then I need to know I'm going to be ok. I made the offering and went to sleep. I woke up tonight then came here to my work, nothing happened in the car. Now, I normally take my break at 830 but stuff happened tonight that kept me from going then. I finally got out at 9 and decided to drive to Tim Hortons for some much needed coffee.   On my way there I had left my radio on CBC and the broadcaster was talking about the inevitability of time, and how life sometimes leaves you in the dark and makes you feel as thought you are lost. Then a song by Greenday came on called good riddance(hope you had the time of your life) if you know the song you realize that he is talking about time guiding you down different paths that seem to stray from the one you feel you should take, and how it will turn out for the better in the end.

Alternatively, the world is based on a self-consistent 4D pattern which is static but updatable, but has no memory of its own updates. Meanwhile, as observers we experience it as a roving 3D moment-by-moment experience.   The two particles are part of the same pattern, across 4D, which includes the observation point - you just haven't experienced it yet. If you try to be sneaky and make changes halfway through the experiment to ""fool"" it, it won't work. You are updating the whole 4D pattern by doing this. Self-consistency across ""time"" is guaranteed; the particles are not separate.  The main mistake we make is that we assume that particles and so on ""see"" their environment in an unfolding sequence of moments and have an ongoing memory of it, like observers do. In actual fact, our experience of particles arises from the 4D world-pattern and the particles are always ""extended"" in time. As are we.  It's more like a multi-dimensional memory than a computer program.  EDIT: Removed a computer code metaphor that isn't clear without a lot of background."

Kinda: They are part of an overall self-aligning 4D pattern such that the overall set of facts will always turn out to be self-consistent. (And that events apparently unfolding moment by moment is a property of the observer experience, not of the world-facts.)   Hey, was I talking to you about the universe as a storage medium (""memory"") or is that something of your own?   Ha, I sort of lose track of which conversations these comments are a part of! Not sure if we've discussed it, but I've been talking about it on other threads. Summarising below to bring it here:  World As Memory  Something I've been playing with that for a while, while experimenting with senses and imagination. It came from a thought I had ages ago about what if the present moment was something I was remembering really vividly, and how that would differ form a ""live"" experience, but there are lots of examples of a kind of ""eternalism"" over history (ironically), to which this is related.  That ongoing experience is basically a pattern recall process follows naturally from the idea that experience occurs in an ""Imagination Space"", when you consider how patterns are activated in imagination. It nicely brings together ideas of what we are (""open aware space"" in which experience arises), the consistency of experience (associative unfolding), synchronicity (memory triggering) and general action (memories ""auto-complete"" from partial sensations).  There is some flexibility in the view: You can't actually tell the difference between recall,  creation-by-implication, associative building of patterns. However, effectively it's as if all possibilities are laid out, dissolved into the background of consciousness, and that you-as-mind is exploring those possibilities by activating the memory patterns. You are exploring the formatting of your own consciousness, while thinking it to be external to you.  One thing it does is help mop up all this ""create your reality"" or glitches stuff into a more coherent view, in the sense of how you might accidentally or deliberately create synchronicity for yourself.   Excerpt from elsewhere, using silly examples (although you should try the ""imagine an owl vividly for 20 minutes"" experiment):  Creation by Implication  A ""decision"" is just a particular imagining which mechanically activates the extended pattern it is a part of, which then comes into sensory awareness. An example:   I imagine an owl as vividly as I can. Subsequently, lots of random owl-based experiences arise. I ""decide"" that I'm going to see an owl at the zoo next Tuesday. Subsequently, I see an owl at the zoo that day.   Both operate in exactly the same way: an imagining is summoned which activates a pattern plus all its associated patterns (i.e. an extended pattern, an auto-completed memory). The field of all possibilities is then filtered through this.  In the first case, I've summoned the picture of an owl (basically saying: ""owl!""), which is associated with the animal owl plus all imagery associated with that, plus notions of flight, feather, big eyes, and all sorts of more subtle linked ideas. Although I may only notice the main owl imagery, actually all of this will show up in my experience, because I haven't narrowed the specification.  In the second case I have narrowed down my imagining to a more specific situation: a specific animal owl, in a specific place, at a specific time. Effectively I'm saying: ""Seeing an owl in the zoo on Tuesday"" and from that the larger pattern is activated. Because it is a pattern extended over time, I seem to experience it as ""happening"" but in fact I am simply having my attention pass across a pattern of moments.   We are using partial imagining to activate extended memories in awareness; The extended patterns then appear spontaneously as sensory experience. These patterns may be spread across time. - TG   EDIT: Reworded, added stuff, probably made it even less coherent. ;-)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34l7xo,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sun May 3 06:54:55 2015 UTC,"Man, I'm spending so much time on this. :)  Let me link you my previous discussion, so we can compare notes (you know, for kicks and giggles).  From this thread:   Physically, our brains store memories as representations that mirror the perceptions/thoughts/feelings of particular moments. These states must contain less information than the actual experience because of storage limitations of the physcial brain. But if we are supposing that ""we"" are greater than our physical brains in this reality, we can conjecture about the true substrate of our minds. Any finite substrate will balk at attempts at storing quantum divergences. But what if the realities themselves are the substrates of storage. As an analogy, reality is a tapestry that occurs as it is woven, and once woven, any point within it can be accessed with the proper means. Ok, so this would imply that the universe(s) could be thought of as a storage medium. If so, then our individual ""perspectives"" are just AI's reading from common storage. We could look at other people's memories in this common storage, but we don't because that's not ""us"". In this way, everyone could be thought of as part of a connected whole (because of the common experiences to reference), however, our ""read"" perspectives are what make us individuals.   I think we have a point of difference, in that I'm still exploring this idea of a master ""time frame"". For the moment, I'm holding out on this because of a personal NDE where the place I went to had something of a sequential discussion going on. The difference, I think, would be that I'm imaginging the tapestry/infinite grid being created as we go along in the master time frame. Whereas you think of it as timeless and complete. Still considering both points of view, though."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34l7xo,Scroon,1 point,Sun May 3 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"Heh, this is good. No idea you were on this. Almost exactly the same model. (We might differ a little on what you are calling the ""AI's"". I see brains as part of the dream. And so on.)   The difference, I think, would be that I'm imaginging the tapestry/infinite grid being created as we go along in the master time frame. Whereas you think of it as timeless and complete. Still considering both points of view, though.   There is no difference, I'd say. Until you have encountered it in some way, there is no discernible difference between a moment that exists and a moment that is implied. And once you have encountered it, it obviously exists*.  *(This is why it's better to avoid that word along with ""real""; it's effectively meaningless.)  Like how an equation implies a graph. Do the points on the graph exist before we put the numbers in and plot the result? When we ""look"" (put specific numbers in), the ""experience"" (the output of the equation with those numbers) is always there.   Not an exact analogy, but you get the idea. If a sensory experience always appears when we direct our attention towards it, it is effectively present and eternal. And anything you imagine instantly exists as a pattern and therefore as a memory. As soon as you conceived of the Infinite Grid, it was effectively complete.  One of the keys to this is that the next-moment is limited only by the facts within this-moment and the implied possibilities. Any next-moment you can conceive of is by definition potentially available (effectively exists) even if not practically achievable (limitations imposed by belief, accepted laws, apparent facts, etc). In the extreme case, this-moment could be completely free of restrictions as regards the available next-moments...  EDIT:   I'll add that one of the reasons to take a simplistic already-exists view, after you've satisfied yourself about the correctness, is that it's closer to how your experience works even in everyday situations (pattern auto-completion). You can't create things deliberately, you can only imply them.   For instance, if you want to visualise an owl, say, the best way is to you summon a feeling of ""owl-ness"" and let the image just come from that ""by itself"". You don't try to manually ""create"" the owl image; if you try it'll only succeed once you give up!   (Also, any sense of dynamic unfolding can be claustrophobic if you become self conscious of it, like suffocating in the thickened mind-stuff of your own dream.)

If all quantum possibilites are implied, then they're as good as existing already. ""You"" just haven't encounted them yet. I'll try to rectify that with my NDE sequential experience. (We're probably onto the same idea reached through different means - which is good.)   For instance, if you want to visualise an owl...   Not those owls again! j/k ;)   Precog experiences imply deterministic, existing futures based on the current state.   My girlfriend and I did have a strangely accurate fortune teller experience with a specific year date and car accident prediction. She got the prediction about 10 or 15 years prior.

I think of it as that right now you are in a particular state which implies a particular trajectory - and therefore you could bring that knowledge into sensory awareness.  Change your state, though, change your trajectory. This doesn't necessarily involve physical action, perhaps: your expectations and intentions are just as much your state as anything else. Changing your expectations might of itself widen the available next-moments - some of which might be highly discontinuous with the now-moment."

The common type of floater, which is present in most person's eyes, is due to degenerative changes of the vitreous humour.

They are also called Muscae volitantes (Latin: ""flying flies""), or mouches volantes (from the French). Floaters are visible because of the shadows they cast on the retina  or refraction of the light that passes through them, and can appear alone or together with several others in one's visual field. They may appear as spots, threads, or fragments of cobwebs, which float slowly before the observer's eyes.

For me when I'm falling asleep (usually when I'm trying to stay awake and failing) I will open my eyes and see things completely differently for half a second. Usually just patterns and colours. Other times I've seen very intense shapes (sometimes looks like humanoid figures or a hand but usually a face) made up of the edges of what is really there. Hard to describe but what I see is what's really there just seen differently for a split second.

Indeed, according to the Kochen-Specker theorem, in the quantum mechanical formalism it is impossible that, for a given quantum state, each one of these measurable properties (observables) has a determinate (sharp) value. The values of an observable will be obtained non-deterministically in accordance with a probability distribution which is uniquely determined by the system state. Note that the state is destroyed by measurement, so when we refer to a collection of values, each measured value in this collection must be obtained using a freshly prepared state.   So despite the same inputs the results can be different, the original state of the model only determines the probability distribution of potential outcomes."

I survived, and was standing next to a man: we were both near a dock and were looking out at the water.  I quickly asked him ""What is the date today?""  He said, quite soberly, ""July 32nd.""  I was really worried for quite some time until my conscious mind finally caught on: July 32nd--a date that doesn't happen at all.

Was visiting family, went outside to find a trailer parked across the street and open. Walked inside the trailer and there was a creature who called himself Pygmalion inside. He said something to the effect of ""You will watch the stones fall today.""  In my dream it was August 23, 2015 (it got kinda burned into my brain, and is still there even though I had the dream back in the late 90's).  I walked out of the trailer and watched as the earth basically split open and most of my family fell in and died, then I fell in and died as well. I slowly became aware that I wasn't dead, and everyone was fine... then I remembered what had just happened and things started to appear weird: people were flying around instead of walking, translucent, etc. I started screaming to everyone ""You're dead! You're all dead!"" and then I woke up.  Mind fuck. Worst part is that Aug 23, 2015 is almost here.  TL;DR: The end is nigh, Aug 23, RIP all ye dead folks.

From that point onwards you were expecting certain things to happen so that they would correlate with the events of your nightmare, namely your dad standing at the stove eating bacon and your step-mum sewing and talking about a craft-show. You say yourself though that you realise that this scene is normal for the weekend and you wouldn't have thought about it twice about it if it weren't for the memory of your dream. It's interesting that you believe that your step-mum spoke the exact same words as in your nightmare, but this I would attribute to your expecting to remember the words that she spoke. Either that particular craft-show was something that you already knew of prior to the nightmare, or it was not uncommon at the time for your step-mum to be going to/producing for craft-shows in general. If you really expect a particular interaction to take place then you can believe that the interaction that does actually happen correlates with what you expected, even if you couldn't predict it beforehand beyond feeling that you could. Like a false memory, I suppose. It's really a testament to the power that our subconscious holds, it's pretty cool. Your going to the water-cooler and saying ""good morning"" was something that even at the time you were consciously aware that you felt you were supposed to do- sounds like you kind of did it in autopilot. Your panicked state only goes to prove the extent of how seriously you believed that what you were experiencing was going to play out a certain way.  It's really quite amazing and I know I would be triple guessing what just happened if I were in your shoes, but what you experienced, whilst certainly enough to shake you up and very interesting psychologically, is entirely explainable without attributing it to parallel universes and/or 'quantum immortality'.  Hope that puts your mind to rest somewhat, and I hope that you're not overly stressed any more; dreaming of a nuclear bomb exploding over you was probably your subconscious trying to get you to consider how overwhelmed and helpless you felt at the time. Anyway, cool experience to have had, if not a little terrifying!"

Even though it was infinitely familiar, it was also Hell.  I tried to move left, then I felt like I got sucked into a tiny spec and reappeared where I was, so I tried to move right, forward, backward, same result.    Then my cousin looked at me and said something so jarring.  Like it was ""the test"" and everything (EVERYTHING) depended on my answer.  He asked me something along the lines of ""Do you get it this time?""    I flipped out, broke free of the loop and grabbed my friend's face, then scratched my cousin and literally ran into the woods screaming.  Even though the initial deja vu ebbed, it returned through out the day and even next several weeks, though not as intensely.  I was psychic for almost a month."

I know this is going to sound stupid but just hear me out.  Every once in a while during the day  déjà vu will begin to set in and I'll remember a forgotten dream that I had days, months and maybe even years before. The dream will be one of those dreams that you have but immediately forget upon waking up.  For about the past five years or so I've come to recognize these dreams and am getting better at getting which dreams are just dreams and which ones are premonitions if you will. Now most of the time they dreams are completely inconsequential. Other times though they come with a deep sense of foreboding.   In conclusion I believe that as long as you spot the dream, recognize it and give it a spot in your mind it cancels it out as a real life situation. I know it sounds ridiculous but better to be safe than sorry right?  Just to be clear I know the dreams aren't déjà vu because as it is happening I'll recall people I've never met or even seen and boom there they are or someone involved in the dream begins doing something that I knew they would do.  Does anyone else do this? Have you gotten better over time? Have you gotten worse or just completely lost all ability?"

Like when you get put under for surgery.. in that time you lost consciousness and your pattern was disrupted. Therefore, you cease to exist for a time in the real world. However, to you.. it was a continuous experience as you always appear wherever and whenever your pattern emerges. It doesn't matter that during your periods of unconsciousness parts of your physical form were changed and altered. Nor would it matter that after 20 years in a coma all of your atoms are entirely different.. only the emergence of the pattern matters. Whenever and wherever it occurs you will follow it.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34e7mp,city17_dweller,3,Thu Apr 30 17:51:52 2015 UTC,"Exploding head syndrome:       Exploding head syndrome (EHS) is a form of hypnagogic auditory hallucination and is a rare and relatively undocumented parasomnia event in which a person experiences a loud bang in their head similar to a bomb exploding, a clash of cymbals, ringing, an earthquake, or any other form of loud, indecipherable noise that seems to originate from inside the head.  This noise usually happens at the onset of sleep or within an hour or two of falling asleep, but is not necessarily the result of a dream.  An episode can last from a few seconds to a couple of minutes. Most episodes occur just after falling asleep or just prior to waking up, and are not associated with occurring in any certain sleep stage. EHS is an uncommon, usually nocturnal parasomnia that arises from the transition between different sleep stages.  Although the sound is perceived as extremely loud, it is usually not accompanied by pain. Attacks appear to change in number over time, with several attacks happening in a space of days or weeks, followed by months of remission. Sufferers often feel a sense of fear and anxiety before and after an attack, accompanied by elevated heart rate. Attacks may also be accompanied by perceived flashes of light (when perceived on their own, known as a ""visual sleep start"") or difficulty in breathing. The condition is also known as ""auditory sleep starts."" The associated symptoms are varied, but the benign nature of the condition is emphasized and neither extensive investigation nor treatment are indicated.  Sufferers may experience an inability to vocalize any sound, or mild forms of sleep paralysis during an attack.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34fxc0,Scroon,2,Fri May 1 05:43:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, all that's true - it was a full 'real' experience' but they retained the knowledge that they were 'really' not there.

It probably says more about the nature of true memory (full detailed sequences) than the nature of brains, and how that differs from what we usually think of as ""remembering"".  Do reveal your agenda then! :-)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34fxc0,TriumphantGeorge,2,Fri May 1 06:03:46 2015 UTC,"This issue of memory is really quite strange. According to conventional thought, memory is the result of stored sensory input to the brain. What this implies is that in order for someone to have a memory, the physical senses must be either be stimulated or, as in dreaming, the sensory processing aspects of the brain must at least output some sort of information to the cognitive processing aspects.  The catch then is to ask how do NDE or OBE experiences fit into this scheme? If the body and senses are truly incapacitated, then conventional thought argues that the source of the memory of the NDE experience must be from the internal sensory processing components firing off in some way.  Now - this will reveal my agenda somewhat - if one truly believes in the validity of NDE experiences, then one must also assume that memory can also originate from sources other than the physical senses or internal sense processing areas of the brain. The very sticky question here is then, how does a non-physical experience apparently write itself to a physical medium such as the brain?  If anything, this is what confounds me. But I do think that a purely physical explanation for NDE's is ultimately unsatisfying.  If we were to follow an AI simulation argument, you could say that our ""true memory"" resides in the upper level reality and our apparent physical brains are just a construct to justify our ability to remember things in this current sim. If someone has an NDE, then their true memory records this (as it always does) but it also must correlate the memory to the current simulated personality (because technically that's who experienced it, not the upper level greater AI). Then, when that personality reboots in the sim, the sim needs to rectify the ""true memory"" with the physical memory to maintain consistancy. So the physical brain gets ""written"", ret-conned if you will, with the NDE which didn't actually happen in the physical (simulated) realm.  Whelp, makes sense to me. :)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34fxc0,Scroon,1 point,Fri May 1 07:15:35 2015 UTC,"I added a little to that comment.  Good stuff. :-)   The very sticky question here is then, how does a non-physical experience apparently write itself to a physical medium such as the brain   So, I'd say you maybe can get further if you think of what you are actually experiencing right now?  You don't experience a brain, you experience a sensory world, a surround-sound moment one after the other. You might have experiences ""as if"" you had a brain, but that's different, that's just an property of the world dream. Meanwhile, seeing other people's brains is just part of the dream; a representation of them. Like a desktop icon. All the imagery we see is a kind of metaphor made sensory.  Your actual experience is of being an ""open aware space"" in which sensory moments arise. If you think of all possible moments pre-existing in a ""landscape"" that is dissolved into the background of this awareness, then you realise you never ""do"" anything, you simply navigate across different moments, unfolding them one by one. Moments are selected according to your expectations, the facts-of-the-world, and intentions. Your personal history is then just the trajectory you have taken across this landscape.  Which gives us: Memories aren't stored in brains, because brains are part of that particular world's set of facts, part of the visual decor. Memories are in fact stored as patterns in awareness, after-images of the sensory moments we have navigated through. However, our access to those memories might be restricted if our attention is too narrowed on a particular sensory experience? Even just because it might not occur to us to look and check...   Whelp, makes sense to me   I really like your description, but I actually wonder if it would be better if you ditched the simulation aspect and went straight for the essence of it, which except for the conundrum about being-a-brain is pretty similar to the way I've been going, but probably easier to follow.  EDIT: More words and sentences."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34fxc0,TriumphantGeorge,2,Fri May 1 07:31:01 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking about that ""open aware space"" in the shower today. How all we really know is this current experience. People tell us our brains do this and that, but when it comes down to it, I'm just taking it in as it come.  Looks like we're on the same page concerning the world dream of brains. I do wonder how strong the interaction and directionality between the physical brain and true awareness is. For example, if someone suffers dementia, then of course awareness is still there, but physical access to memories is degraded. Or perhaps it's only that access to those memories is confused by the disease. There are always stories how hypnosis can bring out lost or distant memories. I wonder if hypnosis is actually accessing ""patterned awareness"" instead of physical storage - much how hypnosis is used to access past lives through regression. (Not saying it's true for sure, but it seems to fit.)  Regarding the simulation aspect, much of the time I'm using it more as a source of terminology rather than a literal model. So by ""simulation"", I more closely mean ""this experience we're having, but we're not sure what it is, and it could possibly be made up, and there's also possibly a higher functional level to it"". By AI, I mean more ""this intelligent perception of ours that may or may not be rooted in our phyiscal brains, possibly rooted in some higher level substrate we are currently unaware of"".  Truth be told, my personal conception of all this is probably more new-agey than hard comp sci. Haha.  (Nice Infinite Grid animation. My mental model is pretty much the same except I like to think of it as expanded into four dimensions - with a fifth dimension possibly linking quantum divergences - or just four dimensions with the divergences spread throughout. I mean dimensions more in a mathematical sense as opposed to the physics one.)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34fxc0,Scroon,1 point,Fri May 1 08:47:22 2015 UTC,"For example, if someone suffers dementia, then of course awareness is still there, but physical access to memories is degraded.    We could look at it this way: If you are ""dreaming"" that you are suffering from dementia, then your experience will be aligned with that - on an ""as if"" basis. Which is not to say you have deliberately, knowingly chosen to have that happen to you.  Hypnosis and relaxation and daydreaming are, I think, ways to loosen our focus from the restrictions of believing we are in a solid world - releases us a little from out ""pretending"" - and gives us access to what's actually available to us.   Regarding the simulation aspect, much of the time I'm using it more as a source of terminology rather than a literal model.   Yeah, I get that but at first I wasn't sure what your angle was, which is why I brought it up. Because people like Bostrom and Campbell are more literal in their adoption of the metaphor, it's kinda polluted it I think.   My mental model is pretty much the same except I like to think of it as expanded into four dimensions...   Yes, that's a good way also.  What I keep in mind is, really our experience is fundamentally non-dimensional. We are just having an ""as if"" experience as regards time. Things like timelines, grids, dimensions, configuration spaces, block universes and so on, are all just ways to help us bring into awareness the larger picture despite the fact that our sensory moment only ever shows a slice of it.   So I say, we get to pick whatever metaphor is useful for what we are trying to achieve at the time.  Often, fiction-based metaphors are more useful than mathematics/physics/computings ones, it's just those are the ones that are taken ""seriously"" as ""real"" right now. Notions of ""persistent realms"" are probably more accurate to our actual experience (e.g. persistent realms in lucid dreams can mirror our waking-world restrictions exactly)."

This is very interesting. Our ""awareness"" is fundamentally non-dimensional then (dreamlike or psychadelic , if you will), although it ""thinks"" in terms of dimensions. I'm debating whether the time dimension is necessary for awareness. Psychadelic experience speaks of timeless experience, although I've never ventured that far with it. It's just hard to remove the idea of ""thought"" from a linear temporal progression. Not saying it can't be done. I'm just having hard time with it.  Fiction based metaphors do get you grouped with the loonies more quickly. Another problem is that those metaphors are often brandished by people who often cling to terminology rather than critical and thoughtful exploration. At least, IMO. Polluted metaphors indeed.  Didn't know the term persistent realms, although I've often wondered if I could return to a persitent dream location. Will read on that."

It's not, I don't think - awareness doesn't need anything in terms of how an experience if formatted, and it's happy with complete emptiness and just ""being"". However, you can't think about timelessness because you can't think about experiences that aren't formatted in terms of the 3D senses (image, sound, texture, location, spatial extent, etc).  Instead you end up conceptualising it like I have - as a vast grid of all possible moments which we navigate across. Converting the time aspect to a space, with our ""attention"" traversing it. Many traditions have some version of 'eternalism' like this. Instead of ""doing"" things via intention, we are then ""filtering moments"" via an intention pattern such that we have sequence of moments that correspond to an  experience of doing.  For practical purposes, it's easier to put this aside and simply recognise that our experience is rather imagined, and that we chose our directions by 'imagining' things a little in order to trigger them - whether that's just the everyday thing of summoning the feeling of ""do this"" which then triggers the movement (think of it as ""auto-completion"" of a pattern), or something more knowing and ambitious.   Fiction based metaphors do get you grouped with the loonies more quickly.   Well, stay away from hobbits and Star Trek and it's okay. :-)   Things like the Metaverse in Snow Crash were I imagine good metaphors, back when there wasn't really a VR thing and the idea of dreams and lucid dreams was still seen as dodgy. We're lucky that people are familiar with lots of different types of media now (notice all the infographics everywhere, etc) so it's easier to build understandable metaphors than it used to be."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34fxc0,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Fri May 1 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Just read your other comment.  Okay, the record-needle-skipping imagery is nice. In my thinking, all possible moments are laid out and we merely 'select' which moment unfolds into the senses. We are not really ""here"" and were are never ""doing"" stuff - we are only ever having experiences.   So jumping to another time is really just a matter of having your attention shifted there, by having your perceptual filter let that moment through rather than this one. (Infinite Grid metaphor and all that stuff.) So, if all moments exist and we are simply navigating through them, how could be deliberately jump to another moment? What is the selection mechanism? Just accumulated patterns in the filter?  The trick remains, how to retain your memory when doing this - i.e. to remember that your perspective was looking through the viewport of ""May 2015"" and is now looking through the viewport of ""November 2004"" or whatever."

When I came to, it felt like years had gone by, but I was fully aware of the ridiculousness of what I had imagined.  The next time was when I was in the Army. Some other privates and I were very bored and unable to get our hands on any other mind-altering substances, so we decided to take turns putting each other in ""sleeper holds.""  That time, I went to a world in which I had never enlisted. I don't recall the specifics, but when I came to on the floor, my first question of course was how long I was out. Everyone assured me I was only out for about one second before I came to. I basically passed out and regained consciousness as soon as I hit the floor, but once again I felt like I had been gone for many years. Waking back up still in the Army felt like I was returning to some horrible nightmare that I couldn't escape from.  Anyway, our brains are really good at inventing elaborate worlds and making us feel like we've experienced a compressed amount of time. I don't think there's anything metaphysical about it.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34fxc0,logansruns,2,Fri May 1 01:42:55 2015 UTC,"Hi, brother. I say brother because you've more or less described the same experience - or maybe I should say ""process"" - I had when I was knocked out about 12 years ago. The elements of my story are maybe a little more NDE or mystical, but what strikes me quite strongly is that your description of ""going under"" and coming back are pretty much exactly the same as mine. I've written about this before somewhere around here.  First of all, two things to clear up. One, you weren't inducing seizures. Seizures are unregulated neuronal firing in the brain. You guys were just knocking yourselves out via oxygen deprivation. Two, while the ""amazing-imaginitive-powers-of-the-mind"" explanation is perfectly plausible and justifiable, I feel that it does not fully address the complexity and specificity of what you experienced. I know how vivid and real it can be, having been there myself. I've also been in delirious and/or compromised mental states, and I know these are not the same thing.  I also had that ""instantaneous"" shift you described. It's like you're just in that new place with no transition or memory of what you had previously been doing. We both know the sequence of events now, looking back on it, but at the time, you were just suddenly there.  You describe waking up as ""rediscovering your past"". I know what you mean. For me, I like to describe it as having to reopen a book you've been reading but haven't looked at for a while. As you start getting into the page, the details of the story start flowing back until you remember what was going on.  So onto theory of what happened. I don't think this is a ""life flashing before your eyes"". I've always thought that was a platitude just to describe a moment of immense fear. I also shy away from calling it an imaginative episode. Both of us know that the details were to vivid and consistent to be some construction from a glitching mental system. So what was it? I think that in some cases, brains can get ""shut off"" to such an extent that it frees the consciousness/soul/AI (or whatever you want to call it) from the confines of this perceptive world. I've previouly thought that this might boot you up a level (stepping back from the simulation), but in your case, it seems like you may have jumped to a previous part of your narrative and run through it again. Think of it like a record skipping. (You remember records, right?) In my case, the ""needle"" jumped off the record, and I could once again hear the sounds of the actual room around me. In your case, the needle got bumped to a previous track. You weren't just remembering that track though. You were essentially living it again. And I think you'll agree that at the time you didn't know it was a repeat. You only know this now looking back at what happened.  So why doesn't everyone experience this? Going back to the record analogy, I think that it really matters how the record player gets jostled. Sometimes, the needle jumps but lands in the same spot. Sometimes, the needle screeches across the record preventing you from hearing anything else in the room. Basically, you got knocked out in just the right way.  Feel free to respond or message me if you want to talk about this further. You story is so close but also so different from mine to make it immensely interesting to me. And maybe I can help you figure things out. (I've thought about this a lot.)"

But, this post was interesting to me because this is something my brother and I were stupid enough to do for fun many many times during my teenage years.  I have quite vivid memories of all of the experiences and feelings that come with it.  So, now I'll give you my feedback.  I have had very similar experiences when we would do this.  In my opinion its just like an extremely realistic dream you're having, only it happens in a very short time.  Whenever you ""wake up"", or ""come to"" after passing out, usually you quickly forget whatever crazy experience you had, kind of like regular dreams, unless you talk about them and describe them to someone immediately.  I can also relate to the feeling of being super confused about where you are when you wake up and taking a little bit to adjust to what just happened, and everything kinda rushes back in all at once and is all blurry.  Sorry if I'm rambling trying to just type this out in a hurry.  But basically, I have had this happen before and never thought too much weird about it.  I just consider it a really hyper realistic dream that happens in a super short time frame.  Our brains are crazy man."

EDIT: I just want to clarify that a bump on the head causing memory loss isn't just something that happens in cartoons.  I was in my third year of Spanish class when I suffered a severe concussion. Prior to the concussion I was nearly fluent, but after the concussion, I had not only forgotten most of my Spanish, I forgot who my teacher was. I was certain my Spanish teacher was still the same woman who taught me the first two years, and I had no memory of the man who was my third year teacher."

I wasn't sure what I was looking at until I glanced around the room and then back at the ceiling. Then it settled down into the solid shape I'm familiar with.  I think it has to do with how the mind's visual areas are actively trying to create scenery while we sleep, so when we wake up the visual parts of the brain have to compete with conflicting information -- the info they're inventing vs the info they're receiving through sensory organs. I think that if I had not been actively trying to see the room around me, my brain would have just continued to construct whatever it was inventing."

Perhaps when we see what we perceive as a ghost or spirit isn't really as such in the classic sense, but perhaps someone from a different timeline whose timeline suddenly crossed with ours, or perhaps they live in an alternate universe where it's still their era instead of ours.  Perhaps string theory or the multiverse theory would explain the possible existence of ghosts or spirits.    It is also theorized that time really has no beginning or end; it is a continuous loop, forever going forward and backward, all at the same time.  This would explain why you'd see a woman dressed in a Victorian-era dress walking through the wall between your bedroom and your kid's bedroom, if they were right next to yours.  She's still in her timeline at the same time you're in yours."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34a6tv,chemcarrots,-2,Thu Apr 30 10:16:14 2015 UTC,Mylee was supposed to be a twin. (Kinda horror-movie-esque. IMO)     maybe that's the origin of the ridiculous name? she's mylee cyrus

Stress can lead to seeing/hearing things. It could be anxieties about your daughter's welfare are manifesting as sights and sounds. For example, you're concerned about backing over your child, so you imagine she's beside the car when she isn't. Your hubby misses playing with her because he's been injured, so he imagines her hanging from the ceiling fan. You're worried about leaving her even for second in the kitchen, so you imagine she's followed you down the hall.  That said, it's also possible your daughter has been psychically projecting herself around the new house. Following you guys around when she's somewhere else. Trying to get her dad's attention by hanging from the fan.  You could try an experiment. Tell her you'll play hide and seek, and she has to find you but she has to stay in one room and try to figure out where you are. Set a timer, and tell her when the timer goes off, you'll come back and ask her if she knew where you were hiding. That might be complicated for a 3 year old, but you get the idea. Now that I think about it though, this would be a perfect set up for a terribly scary scene in a horror movie. Something comes looking for you, but it isn't your daughter!  Best of luck. Hope you get to the bottom of this, and your hubby feels better."

This sounds similar to an experiment I remember reading in a kid's book about ESP.  I think it was to test one's ability for remote viewing or clairvoyance.  The subject stays in one room.  Another person takes a single object, like a toy, and places it somewhere in another room.  The person placing the object then comes back, indicating they've done so, and the subject concentrates, trying to ""find"" the object."

If you don't try then you'll constantly wonder.  But, I think you're assuming a lot when you say ""She basically had the same reaction I did, almost like she had the same dream or something.""  You have no way of knowing what her reaction was about. You have to allow for the possibility that she was startled by the way you were looking at her. From her perspective, it's possible that she was minding her own business when this guy she recognized from high school looked at her with huge crazy eyes and started to approach her, looking at her like she was the Holy Grail for no apparent reason."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34djn7,SaxonWitch,2,Thu Apr 30 12:21:06 2015 UTC,"Psychometry (paranormal):       Psychometry (from Greek: ψυχή, psukhē, ""spirit, soul"" and μέτρον, metron, ""measure""),  also known as token-object reading,  or psychoscopy,  is a form of extra-sensory perception characterized by the claimed ability to make relevant associations from an object of unknown history by making physical contact with that object.  Supporters assert that an object may have an energy field that transfers knowledge regarding that object's history.   Psychometry is commonly offered at psychic fairs as a type of psychic reading.  At New Age events psychometry has claimed to help visitors ""meet the dearly departed"" (a form of spiritualism).   Although the majority of police departments polled do not use psychics and do not consider them credible or useful on cases,    some authors write that psychometry and psychic detectives were used by law enforcement agencies on specific cases.

I personally feel that the only thing between simulation and reality is in fact the ability to become immersed within it enough to not care. That is to say, if you believe something is real, it is real to you... and that's really all that matters.  Everyone believes in something, even if it's just themselves... or nothing... or whatever they're told to believe. With all these conflicting beliefs, it becomes hard to say who is correct... because we want there to be absolutes... we want there to be a Golden point which never changes upon which all standards can be measured... and we try to do this with science by setting the speed of light as a specific number... when in fact... everything changes. Even the very laws of physics change...  The search for knowledge or wisdom or anything really... is a hopeless search with no end and no ultimate victory. Be glad for this! It means we'll never run out of new things to do! It means there's no end to the complexity of fun we can have, or the events we can experience.  Life is all about two things really. Context and motivation. We always measure things relative to a starting point, and so we have many different types of context because people use many different things as starting points for which to measure and map out their systems. Motivation is all about the WHY, and what makes it worthwhile.  The truth is... there is none.  We are indeed just a simulation of a simulation of a simulation... but the Matrix does NOT have you... not if you don't let it.   A tiny tweak of paradigm and it's you who has the Matrix..."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,34702c,TriumphantGeorge,2,Wed Apr 29 07:32:04 2015 UTC,"I fell into thinking that nothing was real for awhile and I think that frame of thinking is a normal progression so we are able to consider thinking further.  I thought perhaps we were all dreaming in a way.  But I believe I am wrong.  Everything is real and if I accept that as a truth, then I have to ask the question in relationship to it being a reality as to the why and the how behind it all.  I spent the last ten years looking into Theology and have come to some interesting ideas.  I am sure nothing I am thinking is new that someone else hasn't already considered but using that field of study has opened up tremendouse doors of thought.    What I realuzed is the need for faith (a fixed train of thought) as well as a burning desire for the nuts and bolts behind that train of thought would be the only way we, as people, are ever going to excel and conquer our physical world.  What many of us do is discredit a field of study just because its not trending and by doing this we shut the door on a hallway that leads to all kinds of doors.  If you don't openthe first door, you will never see the other doors."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,346th6,Epistatic,9,Tue Apr 28 22:12:41 2015 UTC,"Fugue state:       Dissociative fugue, formally fugue state or psychogenic fugue is a DSM-5 Dissociative Disorder.  It is a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality, and other identifying characteristics of individuality. The state is usually short-lived (ranging from hours to days), but can last months or longer. Dissociative fugue usually involves unplanned travel or wandering, and is sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity. It is no longer its own classification or diagnosis as it was in the DSM-IV, but now a facet of Dissociative Amnesia according to the DSM-5.

I'm asking because I don't know much about the actual mental effects of a fugue state other than amnesia.  OP, you should definitely look into DMT trip stories as well. There is supposed to be geometric visuals as well as a rushing, whooshing sensation when you ""break through"" into the alternate-whatever-it-is-dimension.  To apply some glitch theory - I've been mulling the idea that our lives are like choose your own adventure books that any ""higher being"" can pick up and read, again and again. In your case, your higher self possibly glitched and skipped a few chapters in the book. This doesn't mean that your physical body stopped functioning...it kept on with its story, but you missed out on what it was doing.  But again, have your brain checked out."

You need to keep that feeling. Panicking will cause problems and you will literally go crazy because what you experienced was incomprehensible in human terms. What I think you experienced had to do with a deeper version of 'you', kinda like what happens when you die. Yea it makes no sense, but that isn't really for your human self to understand. I think we all have shit like this going on except you don't see it because you're so in the human exprience. You were pulled out temporarily for some reason. Time does not matter in this 'place' as it is experienced differently than human consciousness. Just accept it and move on, it's the best thing that you could do. I suggest reading something about NDE's and psychedelic experiences as they are similar in weird ways usually including that extreme 'calm' and 'peace' you speak of. From all the stuff I've read about things like this I am almost sure that your experience does not end when you die, it has been going on before that and will continue after.

We could never perceive that 3rd dimension.  And other stuff I've read about people slipping into or through other realities make me wonder if there are other '2d' realities perpendicular to ours like two planes intersecting. Or maybe there are tons of these planes all perpendicular to eachother like a big 3d grid and we just inhabit one of the planes. Maybe people see and experience weird shit at those intersections.  I dunno man but there is a lot of crazy shit I've read on here and if even 1% of the stories I've read here are true that means there is some kind of other dimension.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,346th6,chemcarrots,2,Wed Apr 29 13:11:54 2015 UTC,"This use to happen to me all the time when I was 13-21 years old. Sometimes it would be just a couple hours, and sometimes it would be a couple weeks. It was almost like I was on autopilot. I had no emotions but still apathetic thoughts, mostly it was like conciousness floating through tv static, and occasionally patterns would form and seem to make some sort of sense. Sometimes I'd be able to get glimpses of what my body was doing though, and tell myself to take notes incessantly. I ended up with notebooks full of notes about things I did everyday, and have writing all over my arms and legs that said things like, ""Don't forget to have dinner"" or ""Take a shower in the morning"". And when I came out of it, it always felt like waking up from a really good rest, I'd feel happy and alive, but not remember anything. I never went to the Dr. but I always assumed it was some sort of dissassociative fugue. Occasionally I'd have full blown hallucinations too, where I thought was I someone, something or somewhere else, but no time would pass and I'd wake up with the same elated feeling, which I always attributed to seratonin dump in attempt to regulate my chemical balance. It all stopped when I did lsd for the first time."

But I thought about it last night and thought how unusal your experience was.  You pretty much described an Out of Body experience without going anywhere exactly and, this part is the amazing area, someone else was at the helm.  Then it seemed to fall into place for me.   The only thing that seems to fit your description is a condition called Dissociative Identity Disorder.  This use to be called Muliple Personality Disorder.  You were (kinda) put on the shelf and another personality took over your life.  I would guess that the other personality knows all about you but you don't know anything about the other personality.  While you were not piloting you were in an area (mentally? ) that was like a holding pen.  In fact your description sounds similar to another I heard of in the 80s without the water experience etc.  From what you said we can say (if I am correct with what is going on) there are at least two persdonalities (yours and the one that took over for awhile).  But, since you said you could also hear some kind of conversation you have at least one to two more.  If only one, then that personality may have only spoken to the one who was in your body.  It is not unheard of that personilitys know of each other but some are not aware of some.  There is always a personility that lives most often than the others but not as dominant in personility.   Another personality is likely more assertive.  This would explain the loss of time but I don't know why a personality would come forward unless it wanted to experience control or you were heading for an uncomfortabl. time.  Have you noticed anything new that you bought without knowing you did it?  Does your friends or family think you were off character a bit during this time frame?  Have you lost time before but for shorter periods that felt like small jumps intime?  Have you ever heard a friend say that you said something you knew you did not?  Personaly I think what you are experiencing is pretty remarkable.  If I am correct, you maybe able to speak with them if you are more aware of who they are etc.  You may experience loss of time again."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,345u44,UniversalChairs,4,Tue Apr 28 15:24:43 2015 UTC,What did they find?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,345u44,UniversalChairs,9,Tue Apr 28 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"I'm no statistician, so I can't vouch for the credibility of their claims, and they have their fair share of critics.  But according to PEAR's experiments, human minds are apparently capable of influencing the outcomes of random number generators.   In one series of experiments, a small robot would wander around the surface of a table and its movements were determined by a random number generator. Then, human participants were asked to try to influence the robot's movements, trying to make it fall of the table faster, or stay on the table longer, and apparently they found positive results. Again, their methods have been highly criticized, but they carried out these kinds of experiments for almost 30 years.  In another series of experiments (that are still on-going despite no longer being affiliated with the university) called the Global Consciousness Project, statistical anomalies across a global network of random number generators are recorded and compared against other events occurring at the same time. Most notably, the network of random number generators apparently went haywire on 9/11/2001.   They also did some experiments with psychokinesis and remote viewing but I haven't really read up on those that much yet. You can read some more about them yourself on their website. It's all very interesting stuff. The skeptic in me has a knee-jerk reaction to disregard at all as pure BS, but at the same time I have a hard time believing that a research lab could operate at an Ivy League university for three decades if they were not doing anything significant."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,344kbx,TheTraegs,3,Tue Apr 28 07:59:12 2015 UTC,I think you probably delayed taking your foot off the clutch. The car probably died right as you disengaged the clutch... while you were looking at the shifter and processing the fact that you were still in 1st you probably took your foot off the clutch not really realizing it.  I have done something like this several times.  When you drive a manual transmission most of these movements become clockwork and are not given active thought.

It is a bit like an educational system: there may be different paths depending on your goals, level, knowledge etc. Think about it as, I don't know, comparing educational systems of different countries: not everyone who is very smart goes to Oxford, there are literally thousands other ways of getting educated.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,342ywg,Aroha11,3,Tue Apr 28 20:13:39 2015 UTC,"I've read that one, s'good. I like this too (pasting because copies are in the middle of pages):   Narada, Vishnu and Maya  In Devi Bhagwata Purana, it is mentioned that once Narada asked Vishnu about the secret nature of Maya (Illusion).   “What is Maya?” asked Narada.   “The world is my Maya. He who accepts this, realizes me,” said Vishnu.   “Before I explain, will you fetch me some water?” requested the Lord pointing to a river.   Narada did as he was told. But on his way back, he saw a beautiful woman. Smitten by her beauty, he begged the woman to marry him. She agreed.   Narada built a house for his wife on the banks of the river. She bore him many children. Loved by his wife, adored by his sons and daughters, Narada forgot all about his mission to fetch water for Vishnu.   In time, Narada’s children had children of their own. Surrounded by his grandchildren, Narada felt happy and secure. Nothing could go wrong.   Suddenly, dark clouds enveloped the sky. There was thunder, lightning, and rain. The river overflowed, broke its banks and washed away Narada’s house, drowning everyone he loved, everything he possessed. Narada himself was swept away by the river.   “Help, help. Somebody please help me,” he cried. Vishnu immediately stretched out his hand and pulled Narada out of the water.   Back in Vaikuntha, Vishnu asked, “Where is my water?”   “How can you be so remorseless? How can you ask me for water when I have lost my entire family?”   Vishnu smiled. “Calm down, Narada. Tell me, where did your family come from? From Me. I am the only reality, the only entity in the cosmos that is eternal and unchanging. Everything else is an illusion – a mirage, constantly slipping out of one’s grasp.”    “You, my greatest devotee, knew that. Yet, enchanted by the pleasures of worldly life, you forgot all about me. You deluded yourself into believing that your world and your life were all that mattered and nothing else was of any consequence. As per your perspective, the material world was infallible, invulnerable, perfect. That is Maya.”   Thus Vishnu dispelled Narada’s illusion, bringing him back to the realm of reality and making him comprehend the power of Maya over man."

Just like in a night-time dream, if you're not armed with memories to give things context, they can be quite frightening. When you awake, you realise it was ""fun"". Waking life is like this?  When people seek to understand the nature of things, to seek enlightenment, they're trying to find context, and maybe the power to make changes by cheating via ""the power of god"". But perhaps that's a waste: full commitment to the narrative might lead to a life better lived. You get the answers eventually anyway (or: it doesn't matter).   After all, going on a roller-coaster doesn't have any purpose either but entertainment.   If we go on forever - the rollercoaster that never ends - then there's nothing ""fundamental"" to ever learn. It stops mattering so much to influence events rather than experience them. Sure, if you experiment a little you can discover that you're not what you think you are (you are ""consciousness"" rather than a person, you are kinda God or whatever), and can actually do quite a bit to bend things maybe... but, I'll bet, if you got full control for a while, you'd soon want to ""play in ignorance"" again.

Every single one of my most prominent ""glitches"" and ""Mandela Effect"" type incidents were always directly before or after a life changing decision or incident.  Whether it had been a NDE or changing my career path or even meeting a new person who had a large impact in my life.    Some may argue that this may be a personal memory loss issue, due to stress or a change in my way of thinking.  Though it's hard to argue that when there were others involved in many of these ""glitches"" with me.  Was that experience/decision so far removed from the most likely path at the time that our predestined fates had to ""correct itself,"" so to speak, for it to have made sense?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,342ywg,Lady_of_the_Lakes,3,Tue Apr 28 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"Isn't it, however, equally possible (not excluding other options), that a person who underwent a huge personal/spiritual life change would dramatically change his/her perception/perspective on life, and will start seeing things differently? That would not explain some changes people report, but I would argue that a vague feeling that 'a world is a different place' is perfectly explainable from the psychological perspective."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,342ywg,73508,2,Tue Apr 28 18:45:21 2015 UTC,"So are you saying that, in some cases, 1) you ""noticed"" the ME (Mandela Effect) after an NDE or that 2) the changed event was chronologically after the ME?  Example: 1) Found out Mandela died in prison - NDE occurs - Hey, now everyone says Mandela didn't die in prison? or 2) NDE - one month later Mandela dies in prison - 10 years later, you find out Mandela didn't die in prison  I'm just a little confused by the before/after chronology you're referencing. (BTW, thanks for the reply.)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,342ywg,Kingofqueenanne,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:02:52 2015 UTC,"I've had three NDE's in my life, as if one wasn't enough.  My first NDE was in 1994, second was in 2004, and third was in 2014.  (Just realized I have one every 10 years.)  Prior to each of them, I had a period of severe anxiety and panic attacks.  I always seem to have a panic attack directly before something bad is going to happen.  I seem to pick up on my surroundings very well.  I feel like my condition has more to do with having ""heightened sense of self-awareness.""  I always over-think and over-analyze everything, which leads to me having anxiety and panic attacks.  I also have a very sharp, photographic-type memory.  I can run through a specific conversation from a couple of years ago, in my mind, as if I was watching a recorded video of it.  I should also mention that each of these events were out of my control.   After my first one, in 1994, my aunt was a completely different person than I had remembered her, even at my young age (10).  In fact, after the NDE she was a severe crack addict who lived on the streets, prostituting.  I don't recall her being this way prior to the NDE (drowning).  My NDE was very unexplainable, too.  Here's the thing.  In reality, I didn't drown.  The strangest part was, I remember drowning; gasping for air, fighting with all that I had in me to push my face above the surface of the water, I quickly got worn out began sinking to the bottom of the pool.  I had fallen into the deep end and didn't know how to swim, my mom wasn't paying attention, she was talking to the neighbor lady.   I remember struggling, no longer able to hold my breath, the water coming into my mouth then bam just like that it was like time had reset to immediately right before I had fallen into the deep end.  I was completely dry, that's what has messed with my mind all these years.  Needless to say, I flipped the fuck out, was crying and hysterical.  I told my mom and she just brushed it off, saying they hadn't seen or heard anything, that I hadn't even been in the water, I would have been wet if I did.  She said it was just my imagination or probably my ""guardian angel"" that saved me from nearly drowning, just to quiet me, I'm guessing.  Though, it wasn't, I swear to you.  I could never find an explanation for the mind-fuckery that happened to me.  Until I came here & began reading into this type of NDE glitch happening to others.  How common it is for time to simply ""reset"" to before the event that killed you even happened.  I never heard of Quantum Immortality until this past year, though it's the only explanation I have found so for what I experienced.    I'm absolutely terrified of water now, it was such a silent death, there was no way I could even make noise or call out for help.  That experience was so life-altering, in the sense that I began to question everything around me.  It's as if I had become more self-aware of my surroundings following that event.  The second one I discussed here, where a person who I had never met came into existence.    My last one, a person had completely changed in appearances directly before the NDE.  I also had a foreshadowing phenomenon, which predicted the event which caused my NDE, which was odd, in itself.  I don't know if it would be significant, or not.  Though, I feel like I was warned before it happened.  I don't know by who/what.  Also, before the event, my neighbor had a buzzed haircut and was from Russia.  One day, I saw him and he suddenly had long hair and he was from Mexico and had the Mexican variant of his Russian name.  I was thrown back, I saw him the day before when he didn't look like this and had an entirely different accent.  I asked others and they said, No, he had always been this person.  He was barely recognizable and acted very different.  It looked like him, but at the same time it didn't, which was very unnerving.  Shortly after this is when I had my last NDE.  I know for sure that it was The BerenSTEIN Bears before the 1994 NDE.  It was my favorite book.  I remember even watching the cartoon, which is how I learned how to pronounce it (beren-STEEN).  If it was anything different, the cartoon would have most definitely corrected my error.  It was also most definitely The Interview with A Vampire before the 2014 NDE.  I even had the book as a teenager, so I don't know how to explain either of those, or what exactly happened to me.  Edit: Sorry for the wall of text, will elaborate more if you'd like."

It's probably also in many home installations like smart meters and stuff like that. It is watching us and it is learning from our experiences. These things being described could be its method of 'communicating' with us or at least changing stuff and giving us what it thinks we want.  Even notice how if you buy something on Amazon then it will suggest the same product to you again even if there's no reasonable presumption you'd want to buy two of them?  That's just an algorithm but there could be an artificial intelligence behind the algorithm too.

Next time check him by asking him a question that a robot probably wouldn't understand. Or maybe ask him a paradoxical question that doesn't have an answer just to gague his response. See if he reacts like a human and notices the paradox or if he can answer a fairly complicated but normal question. If he just tells you some bullsh*t like ""go sit down"" or says something stupid that doesn't make sense well. .

Because she wanted Power, the Old God N'zoth called out to her, promising her power. The Old God N'zoth turned them into Naga. Also, would you mind posting a link to this song? I've never heard this song before, the only song I can think of that affects the Highborne is sung by Slyvanas Windrunner, and it details the fall of Quel'thalas, not Azshara's kingdom."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,341ao1,UniversalChairs,7,Mon Apr 27 14:56:50 2015 UTC,"There may be a logical explanation. Inside a light bulb is a filament: a thin metal wire, coiled up like a spring. Electricity causes the filament to heat up and glow. After many heating/cooling cycles, the filament may break and the light is ""burned out"".  However, the little metal spring may only be broken in one spot and could still be bouncing around inside the lightbulb. Sometimes, (due to heating, cooling, or vibration), the little spring will reconnect to the place it broke off from and you'll get a little more life out of the bulb before it finally burns out for good."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,341ao1,certnneed,6,Mon Apr 27 15:25:03 2015 UTC,My bathroom light does this. It'll not work for a few days and then be working again just like new. Never bought new light bulbs and I live alone.   I've reasoned that mine is either a faulty switch or a glitch.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,341ao1,ml568,3,Mon Apr 27 15:19:39 2015 UTC,"It's possible the bulb is a bit loose in the socket.  For quite some time it was barely tight enough that it was making electrical contact and the bulb would light.  Heating and cooling, air movement etc. may have caused the bulb to move by tiny amounts until one day it was just barely loose enough that it was no longer making contact and you thought it burned out.  For nearly a week, it stayed just beyond electrical contact, but still moving tiny bits.  Until last night it made contact again.  Try turning the bulb, and see if there is room to tighten it in the socket.   I think atmospheric conditions - temperature and humidity - also have an effect on the proximity required to create an electric circuit."

They ended up both being there, at opposite ends of the station, and waiting for each other for two hours. They each went around the station multiple times, to check if the other is waiting at the other end.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,idwthis,11,Sun Apr 26 23:35:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit confused, in your post you said she did not see any of the same events on the train as you did. In your reply you say she did? Which one is it?  If it's that she didn't see the same events, I think the answer is clearly that you two were on different trains. It may have been that a train was re-routed, either passing through the station where you get on when it doesn't normally, or not passing through the other person's station (not sure which of you gets on first or where, but if you board at different stations I'm nearly 100% sure it's a train re-routing).  For example I used to take the subway in NYC. On service weekends (when they service the tracks) some trains are re-routed through other stations for some distances before returning to their original lines. Other routes are split into two sections. If either of those things happened on your routes you would maybe not notice but it would explain why you two would be on different trains running on the same route at the same time.  ETA: I want to add that you could easily check this yourself by searching for the service and route information for the past weeks for your trains online. Usually the train company has this information along with dates on their website!"

So for example, you sit down in the rear carriage, a couple of stops later some extra carriages are added, and then a couple of stops later she gets onto the new rear carriage. You both end up on the same train at the same time, at what you both think is the same spot, but actually in separate carriages."

And then at some point a few weeks later, either DST ended (began?) or somehow your time got corrected (maybe by someone else doing a favour?) and you guys synchronized again?   The things that shouldn't make sense with that theory is if you guys got to your destination on time even if one of your clocks was wrong, and it's unlikely that you guys never noticed.

I've never had it happen for consecutive days, but once arranged to meet my husband in the library. I was the only person in the reading room, and sitting in a highly visible spot facing the entrance. The time to meet came and went and he hadn't shown up, so I walked to our ultimate destination.   ""Where were you?"" he asked/I asked. He had come looking for me, but hadn't seen me, nor I him. The really odd thing about this experience was that just as I had sat down, the curious thought flashed through my head that there might be a frequency of invisibility if only one knew how to attune to it.  Your English is very, very good. I would not have known it was your second language. But it's a quirky language. Here in the US, ""laid off"" means we have been let go from a job. Our British cousins would probably say ""made redundant."" So in your instance I might write ""when I get out of school (uni, to the Brits) and she gets off work.""  Other quirks between the two versions:  ""I will knock you up"" in Brit speak means knock on your door. In the US, it would mean get you pregnant.  When Brits get pissed,they are drunk. When we get pissed, we are angry.  And in the US, it is common for boys named Randall to be nicknamed Randy, which tickles my Brit friends, because to them it is the equivalent of calling someone ""Horny"".

And thank you for your compliment on my English, I appreciate it very much, since, as you've said, English is more of a quirky language, rather than a difficult one from a technical point.   Yes, I don't think my friend is lying either, and I'm sure as hell I am not. Adding the fact that you were thinking of the possibility of attaining a frequency of invisibility makes your experience even stranger than mine, wow! I mean, could it be?

While I'm ready to admit that you have no reason to believe that I said the truth, I'm rather confident that I didn't give any evidence that would support this opinion.

If it doesn't make sense to you should ask them why they're doing it.    This is obviously pointless, because they would of course lie to me. To get the truth out of them, I'd need to create a long chain of questions where I could deduce the truth out of the opposite of their answers, but there is the risk that   I might slip up and let them a way out that would allow two or more interpretations, or they might slip up and accidentally answer one of my questions truthfully.   So by and large, I don't think it's worth the effort. Besides I haven't seen this guy for about 10 years - believe it or not."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,aivilo_,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:28:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, the same logic can still kinda work even if you both are girls. Maybe she was with someone that she didn't want you to see her with and avoided you, but still wants to remain friends. She might think that if she told you it was a work schedule change then you might think it was rude of her not to give you a heads up, so maybe then she just said she was there the whole type and tried to play it some weird coincidence, hoping you wouldn't dig too much into it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,aivilo_,12,Tue Apr 28 04:40:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think that's the case, simply because almost two weeks later, she was at our usual spot again, happy to see me, to ask how I've been, and I've said, our routine is back in place now.  If she wanted to avoid me, then she would have just switched wagons, and she wouldn't have to see me at all after that, because it's not like I would have started searching the entire train for her, and she knows that."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,aivilo_,-8,Sun Apr 26 15:39:01 2015 UTC,"Oh for crying out loud, yes she could have been avoiding you, not because she was fed up with you but because she went through something during that period, that she didn't want to share (break up, death in the family, you name it)."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,Vampircorn,14,Sun Apr 26 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I am not ruling that possibility out entierly either.   But given the fact that we've had a few serious conversations, the kind of ""between us girls"" type, and I've shared with her when I had a rough time with my family, and again, I'm really not the persistent person at all, she shared personal things with me out of her own will, so it wouldn't make much sense if she avoided me because of personal stuff because:   She doesn't have a boyfriend, she says she doesn't have the time, she leaves home at 6 A.M. in the morning and gets back at 18:00 P.M. We may not be Thelma and Louise, but we're good pals, and if there was indeed an incident of death in her family, she would have told me, or she would have worn black for several weeks (because that is the tradition in my country when someone close to you dies), since she's a fairly religious person (in a pretty harmless way)."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,CarolineSchmaroline,7,Sun Apr 26 22:36:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it was, but If it was her avoiding you it could be something she would be embarrassed about specifically because you are friends. She might have been with a person that she would rather not have you knowing about or have been in a situation that wasn't too serious but she still doesn't want to have you knowing about it because she appreciates your friendship."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,heimeyer72,6,Tue Apr 28 08:57:11 2015 UTC,Since you both are on this same train every day you must see other regular passengers right?  Was there any other people missing during this week?  Ask her if she saw any body not there or if there was anything unusual
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,TheFlashFrame,6,Sun Apr 26 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"I will try to ask her, but I honestly as far as I remember, I didn't notice anything else out of place. I can recognize quite a few people who use the same train as us to get home, and as far as I'm concerned, I didn't spot any significant absence, but then again, it's not like I was even aware of this whole thing at that time, I really believed that her work schedule has been changed, and she has to take another train home."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,TheFlashFrame,4,Sun Apr 26 22:44:04 2015 UTC,"Quite a long shot, but maybe other regular passengers could say whether they saw you or her on the train that week?"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,trixter21992251,7,Sun Apr 26 23:01:59 2015 UTC,Maybe the tracks were being serviced and the train was rerouted before your stop or hers and instead a different train came. That would explain both of you two riding the train at the proper time and why she can't recall the events that you can. Check online to see if your Department of Transportation (or similar) has any records of servicing.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,SaxonWitch,11,Mon Apr 27 08:48:09 2015 UTC,I was once meeting a guy in a pub and I waited for half an hour for him. After a while I called him and he said he was there. He ended up just being behind a column and was waiting for me the whole time too. Same thing?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33x9tz,trixter21992251,7,Sun Apr 26 17:25:56 2015 UTC,"No, because there are no columns in the train wagon me and my friend usually meet, and it would have been impossible not to spot each other if we both were actually there, which we apparently were, but did not witness the same events, hence the strangeness.  By the way, this is just something that happened to me, it's also very possible that it was all just a misunderstanding, even tough until now, I can't comprehend how. I didn't neccessarily claim that what I've lived must have surely been a glitch or a pass through a parallel dimension, it's just a possibility, a far-fetched one, if you'd like, and that's why decided to post this here."

So, did I get that right:  You and her observed the same events outside the train and/but different events inside the train?  Also - could you think of any other explanation that would still fit to the facts? Serious question! We can rule out anything that would have to do with (mis-)remembering, can't we? So what might theoretically (still) be not impossible - an extra carriage on the train that changes which one is the last? If yes, could that (theoretically) fit to the different events observed on the train?   Also, 2 - from the top post:   And she replies, bewildered:  Huh? No. Not at all. I have been riding the same train, and I always stayed in this spot, I assumed YOU were the one who couldn't make it anymore. I was here almost everyday, but I never saw you.   ""bewildered""... And for this to be prank, she must have prepared it, avoiding you for the time in question, planning the ""reunion"", keeping a straight face, then a bewildered one...

The only thing reality-shattering about this is if you believe that cats are not capable of forming social bonds and communicating with their peers.   Cats, like most mammals, have friends and enemies. They learn things from their experiences such as the best places to hunt prey and the most dangerous areas not worth going to, and they share this information with each other. The finer nuances of their communications are not well understood, but MANY animals have language that they use to pass information to each other. It's not at all uncommon."

It's about sharing and discussing experiences, specifically experiences which caused the OP to question their assumptions about everyday reality - from their point of view.  The interpretation comes after, from we-the-readers - and as applied to the story, not  just a generality (""seizure!"")...   There are just so many submissions lately that can be easily explained..   And I'm not at all convinced that people's stories are ""easily explained"" by those concepts. Just naming and categorising isn't sufficient. Not long ago, unusual experiences would have been attributed to ""hysteria"", or the temperature of the brain, with no further discussion required.  For instance, in studying the frequency illusion ""these authors conclude that a module or algorithm of mind exists that is able to compute with frequencies but not probabilities"". Oh really. I'd love to see those modules... Currently, we don't even have memories located, never mind understanding their structuring and reconstruction.   These phenomena are recognised, not understood. Mostly the explanations offered are examples of crap modelling with dubious metaphors. Peer published circle jerks. There is still much to discuss!  They are starting points, not conclusions.   Reading accounts of events that are actually fairly well understood only makes this sub less interesting   It's not clear that removing the posts you deem uninteresting will result in the magical creation of more interesting posts to replace them.  The more we pre-filter things, the more people will... just not bother. This place will die if it becomes an excessively formal project.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33xyt3,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:55:15 2015 UTC,"Perhaps as the community becomes more established, things will sort out on their own?   I'm hoping we are gradually heading this way anyway. Even just having the tags seems to bring a bit more in terms of theorising and thought.  As I pondered on the ""purpose"" post a while back - there are two sides to this: collecting anecdotes and discussing them, and arriving at theories.   If we clamp down on the former too much, we prevent the flights of fancy that can inspire the latter. Sometimes the random information that commenters bring is more interesting or important than the original post. If the default explanation became the filter, none of that would happen.   But (if we get keen) some sort of wiki which collects ""categories"" and ""different views on perception and glitches"" might be good. The big problem with subreddits is that there is no persistence of conclusion, as it were. We learn something, six months later we learn it again.  It would also allow us to have links to  sets of particularly interesting glitches saved under, say a category with summary on a wiki page.  Also I'd add: Having fun is allowed. I don't actually mind the occasional silly cat conference anecdote, especially if it plays knowingly to the subreddit's origin."

However, it would be fallacious to assume that all the stories that could be explained by a cognitive illusion were actually one.

It happened to my grandpa too though in the same house!  I have been searching the entire Internet for just one other person who has seen this shit for the past 15 years!!!  You!!! You are the only other person on Earth I have found who has seen the portal, except mine was bright blue with stars.  It was on the ceiling and appeared in one of the ceiling tiles above me.  My grandfather independently told me he saw one too, before I even told him about it, and we both saw a blue space with stars.  He claims that he had an out of body experience flying through it though.  Maybe this has something to do with universe shifts.  Maybe we're all Planeswalkers..."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33vofj,AnotherSmegHead,2,Sun Apr 26 09:18:43 2015 UTC,"Certainly.  It appeared as if peeling back part of reality in the piece of cork-board in the ceiling.  It happened at least 2 times that I recall.  The blue space (as me and my friends have been calling it) has depth that like real space is infinite as yours is described.  However, its full of twinkling lights that are star like.  Not empty and solid colored like magenta-space.    What is consistent in both of these is also the surface type:  Small rectangular surface semi-parallel to the ground.  Except yours is facing up and mine was facing down.    The one my grandpa saw was also on his ceiling, but I don't recall if it was a drop ceiling like my room or pop-corn textured or what.  My grandparents sold the house a long time ago.    What kind of ""shifting"" do you mean?  Depth?  Shape?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33vofj,AnotherSmegHead,2,Sun Apr 26 09:30:14 2015 UTC,The shifting that was happening on this magenta plane was extending out from the moment - as if it were a conveyer belt stretching off from that moment in time to anywhere else.  For lack of a better description - I would say that it was the light path of ultraviolet light that our universe drags behind it into the past as the universe expands outward.  It felt that I had opened a drawer to discover this light path and popped my mathbook on top to ride our trails that we leave in space/time as a fixed point in the universe.

For instance, London Beauty Queen posted about it along with the embedded Youtube clip on February 22nd, 2013, two days prior to the television air date.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33rxk4,MauryMoss,17,Sat Apr 25 01:13:56 2015 UTC,"It is my opinion, that Deja Vu is really Deja Reve.  Deja Vu is French for already seen whereas Deja Reve is French for Already Dreamed.  Most theories on Deja vu exclude this link to Deja Reve where those who have Deja Reve know that the source for the memories of this familiar pattern emerged in a past dream.    This means, we are literally seeing future events in our dreams.  This is also known as precognitive dreaming.    What makes the difference between deja vu vs deja reve is that the person when they have the deja experience links the memory back to the dream in the past.  That is when deja vu is no longer the term.  It is deja reve.  Were you able to link any of the memories back to past dreams during the onset of deja?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33rxk4,Ian_a_wilson,10,Sat Apr 25 02:40:45 2015 UTC,Interesting. I once was planning on getting my portrait drawn from a street artist. I dreamt about it the night before I actually went and in my dream the artist made some very obvious mistakes (it was supposed to be realistic as opposed to a caricature.) the left eye was drastically misplaced and misshaped. I woke up and thought it was weird. I even told the people with me about it.  Later that day when I got the actual portrait done it looked just like the messed up version from my dream the night before. Totally blew my mind. Maybe just a giant coincidence though.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33rxk4,Ian_a_wilson,3,Sat Apr 25 03:28:17 2015 UTC,"You would need to have it happen a lot to see past the coincidence and understand that the initial dream when literal to the future event is legit.    The problem why most don't remember stems from something I call sleep induced amnesia which causes memory loss of dream content.  It seems those who are more adept at dream recall will increase the deja reve frequency over those who do not remember dreams.  The key is memory, and how we better remember dreams is the first step to personally exploring this underlying relationship between precognitive dreams and deja vu."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33rxk4,ntresch,2,Sat Apr 25 13:48:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with this one hundred percent. I've had my own experiences with this, and I've always been lucky enough to remember the dream that predicted what was happening.  Interestingly enough, in my case, it's always been a circumstance that would have really freaked me out badly if I didn't know what the outcome was going to be.  For example, once I dreamt that everywhere I went in the city, I kept hearing this mechanical whirring noise from behind me in the darkness. In the dream, I kept getting more and more terrified and I started to fresh out really bad to the point that I ended up getting the police and an ambulance called on me. I was panicked and convinced that some kind of evil robots were following me and going to do something bad.  Eventually, the paramedic opened my back pack, and my electric toothbrush had been contacting something and turning on to make the noise. I lathed for twenty minutes in the dream.  Fast forward two nights... There I am, out in the city drinking and having s good time, when from behind me I hear an eerie whirring noise.  In real life, I recalled that the source of the noise was something very funny because of the dream and for the rest of the night I'd giggle when I heard the noise. When I ended up at home and see the toothbrush in my back pack, I realized that I may have recalled the dream to keep me from having a nervous breakdown or something..."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33rxk4,Ian_a_wilson,3,Sat Apr 25 12:23:36 2015 UTC,It can be a very profound experience especially when the dream content is so literal to the future event that it becomes hard to dismiss the idea it was just chance.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33rxk4,SushiAndWoW,2,Sat Apr 25 19:02:43 2015 UTC,"From my perspective, the main value of this sub is to provide a place where we can share our subjective experiences, without them being outright dismissed.  If you accept that philosophical materialism is likely false, the possibilities are somewhat endless. One possibility is that the claims in these types of books are substantially true. What I find interesting about these books - Newton's, Weiss's, Ra's - is that their subject matter overlaps, and that where it overlaps, it is complementary, and yet substantially consistent.  Most of these sources suggest that our space-time is not unlike an illusion; that it is coupled to time-space, which has its own physical rules; that a part of us has access to time-space, but it is separated from our conscious self by a veil. This veil is permeable, however, and sometimes allows a link to apparent precognition or telepathy experiences as sometimes described in this sub.  This is indeed a glitch. It's not intended to help you win the lottery, it is intended to let you know that the world is more than it seems it is, so that you might avoid choosing a counter-productive life path based on incorrect assumptions about reality.  Or, you know, it could be something entirely different. :) I just personally find this explanation plausible."

In terms of hard science, godlike intuition is pretty much only explained by statistics in the context of the occasional random alignment of happenstance and the overabundance of the predictive circuitry in our brains.  You're welcome to promote quantum physics or time travel or actual prophecy or nonlinearity of time or the four-dimensional self or whatever else you want, but I don't think those are very satisfying to people with their feet firmly on the ground.

Such a hypothesis is perfectly rational. If you believe it to be not, you are conflating rationality with something else - perhaps a bias towards that with which you are familiar. In this case, you're using the word ""rational"" to describe a way of thinking that is actually irrational - a way of thinking that involves an implicit bias.

In this case, you may refer as ""hard science"" to the process itself: the collecting of evidence, the conducting of studies, the forming of hypothesis, the testing of them.  This process informs us about what we do know; it does not inform us of what we do not know. To make the claim that ""hard science"" tells us that the universe is made of plain matter; that consciousness ""clearly"" must arise out of it - well, that's not hard science at all. That is an untested hypothesis. If you take this hypothesis as fact, well, you truly know little of hard science. Because the last thing ""hard science"" allows is to jump to conclusions like this!"

When you say ""hard"", what you mean is ""settled"". What is it that's settled about science? Engineering. We can build things. When those things work, we know that the science about them is mostly correct.  We know it's mostly correct. We have no knowledge of its completeness.  You appear to believe that the fact that our bridges stand, and our mobile phones work, implies that our knowledge of physics is near-complete. But the only evidence we actually have is that we are substantially on the right track. We have no evidence about how much more physics there is to discover.  That is the error implicit in the phrase ""hard science"". What's settled in science is engineering, and what's at the forefront of science is not settled.

I was sitting in the car with my mom and her boyfriend, and we were about to get out to go into a restaurant. The car was still on, and my mom's iPhone was connected and playing music.   The song that was playing ended and for some reason, I started singing the first lines of Rihanna's Disturbia. At the same time, the next song started playing. It was Disturbia.   My mom turned around and asked, ""Did you look at my playlist?"" and I was like, ""No.."" We were all kind of shocked but at the same time it was hilarious.

You don't understand what's impossible about a jogger taking a left off the main road (a detour), then catching up with a car on that same road a mile later? You must be that slow driver I'm always stuck behind."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33smxq,UniversalChairs,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:11:18 2015 UTC,"Driving in a residential area where you will see joggers means driving 30 mph or less with lots of stopping and starting due to traffic lights and stop signs. Given that we're talking about ONE MILE, then the car would have taken at least two minutes with no stops. Quite often, a traffic signal can take up to two minutes to change. So if it was four minutes later, then we have a human running a four minute mile, which is fast but not inhuman.  Now, I want to remind you that OP didn't state that it was precisely one mile, it was a general estimate of ""about a mile."" It's possible that it was 3/4 mile. It's possible that it was 1/2 mile. It's possible that it was 1 1/2 miles. Given the generality of this issue and all the other possible variables such as traffic, school zones, other pedestrians, etc, there is nothing unbelievable about seeing the same jogger one mile down the road a short time later."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33smxq,2realNOT4real,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:37:20 2015 UTC,"That doesn't account for the detour the jogger would have taken. A four minute mile on a straight is one thing, but they turned left, which would have meant, at the least, jogging perpendicular to the road, making a right and jogging a while parallel to the road, then another right, jogging perpendicular to the road again, then another left onto the road. Maybe another half mile added to the jogger's route as compared to the car. I'll also add that most roads that one would describe as a ""long and windy road that went for miles and miles"" aren't found in residential areas and rarely have many stops along the way.  Sure, what you say is possible, but it's highly improbable. A more likely explanation is that two twins wearing the same outfit were jogging about a mile apart from each other; still unlikely but it's not unheard of for twins to purposely fuck with people like that."

As soon as he drove over the last of the speed bumps, he floored the pedal.   The car picked up a lot of spped before he turned the car into a tree.

BUT you could have been hurt really bad if you had not tried to get your cell phone.  Maybe when you were starting to reach down you were also unbuckling your seat belt.  Maybe the crash hit that second before the belt was completely disengaged causing it to snap further breaking its plastic?  I am a firm believer that the other side is always helping us.

We approach an intersection and I suddenly have a thought ""What happens when we get Tboned?""  I start bracing for an impact by tensing my back into my seat against the lumbar support and neck support to make sure I'm fully cushioned and braced.  Two minutes later the crash happens.  My family's car was struck at full highway speeds on my side of the vehicle.  I get out and the airbags have gone off - so I start making sure everyone's OK.  I grab my parents' cellphone and start calling 911.  I'm not sure I could have done all those things if I had been fully buckled up - despite what safety efforts I still do to this day - as the side of the passenger's door was badly damaged.  I still buckle up - every ride.  But for some reason that day I didn't."

I wonder if you could search online for magicians in your area and see if you can find him (like seeing his pic online).  Or even ask other magicians if they've ever heard of him.  Thanks for sharing!

What if he was an hypnosis artist and didn't do any physical tricks at all, just let all of you imagine some? He could have made you forget that he spoke something. And the bathroom - as soon as you entered, he told you that you don't see him and to forget that you heard him speak and just walked out.  But yeah, if you and the other students remember him at all, somebody should have heard of him."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33n1ch,vezokpiraka,7,Fri Apr 24 10:42:45 2015 UTC,"It is.  Regardless of from which POV you see it.  But let me try to be the hypnotist: ""Everybody in the class, hear my voice. Only my voice, nothing else. Nothing else...""   *CLAPS HANDS*   *Notices some studends reacting to it*   ""Please raise you hand if heard hands clapping! - Everybody who has raised a hand now, please follow me. Who does not have raised a hand, stay on your seat. You hear nothing but my voice!""  *motions the rest of the students to leave the room with him, closes the door and says outside*  ""You guys are immune against getting hypnotised :) Let's do a little prank for the others: I will create the illusion of magic tricks for them and I need your help - you must pretend to see the tricks as well! And not tell afterwards, 'cause it's magic ;-) Will you help me? - ok, let's go back in.""  ... on with the show ...  I just made this up right now, I bet an experienced hypnosis magician can deal much better with such a situation. It's just an example about how one might do it.  I know one little magic trick. When I showed it to a classmate, about 35 years go, she was like '...what??!? O_o'. When I showed it to my nephew and a few other kids a few years ago, they were like ""waaait a minute! :D Lemme see the last part again :- ) "" Something seems to have changed in the last 30 years, to the better, I think.  Edited several times to get the formatting halfway right."

That's just weird.   The problem also comes from no one remembering his name. As a party-magician word of mouth is probably your best source of publicity. If no one knows you then no one will hire you.   I'm not sure if you've met magicians that go to school, but they are usually not very wealthy. They need the money and they work nearly non-stop."

Magically add a few digits to his bank account, for example. Or alter the perceptions of bank employees so that they think he has more money than he does. Or just walk down Wall Street and pickpocket investors without even touching them, via teleportation or something.  Then again, if we go by the ideas common to this sub, maybe he's just a normal guy from another dimension/universe and has no need for our version of money. Or he's from the future, where checks are completely obsolete and not even made anymore (like black & white TVs or 8-track tapes), and therefore the idea that he had to pick up a check never even occurred to him.  Really, though, I wonder if maybe there was more than one guy, such as two magicians doing separate sets. My schools usually had performers for assemblies do two or more performances, with a portion of the student body present for each show. It could've been one guy for the first performance, a different one for the second, and that's why nobody can agree on what tricks were done nor figure out who it was. Though even if that were so, the check thing is still strange..."

I'm telling you, there were about 15-20 people around him. Out of everything he did, nobody understood that. He didn't have sleeves, the table was flat, no trap doors even though we could see the melons coming out of the hat. You could see under the table too.

I was a sophomore at a certain Christian college in a very small town, and I was living on campus while I went there. 'Townies' often liked to come visit the college and hang out, before they put electronic locks on all the doors.  Anyway, there was this one townie who seemed friendly enough with me and my friends. He was easygoing but didn't talk much. He did like to do a few card tricks the few times he actually sat with us in the student center.  It wasn't anything about him personally that was freaky, but the card tricks he did. He would ask any of us to think of a card at random, which we did. Then he would go through the deck cold, and pull out that exact card.  None of us mentioned what card we picked. (nothing to eavesdrop)  None of us watched him as he went through the deck. (so no tells)  We would think of any card at random, keep a straight face with eyes shut the whole time, and he'd up and pull out that one card out. No errors. He could pick out the right card and when we lied and said it was the wrong card, he knew we were, somehow.  I know how you have folks who can read other people, and be extremely good at deciphering body language. How this allowed him to work out to consistently picking one card out of 52 every single time, dealing with some intelligent college kids, I have no idea.  I just know it went from, ""hey that's cool dude, how'd you do that"" to ""OK just stop, you are really freaking us out.""  It was enough that I made the deliberate choice to want to avoid this person whenever I saw him, because I was starting to question whether I had seen what was merely some very good 'stage magic', or whether something genuinely paranormal was going on. Be skeptical, there's plenty of reason to be, but even twenty years later it still kind of freaks me out."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33n1ch,bman214,3,Fri Apr 24 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"I had a weird experience in middle school that wasn't with a magician, but was with someone that called himself something else... I can't remember exactly, but he made it clear he wasn't a magician, and made it very VERY clear that he did not want to be called a ""mind-reader.""  At first I wasn't very engaged in the assembly. I have ADHD (though wasn't diagnosed at the time) and paid some attention, but I was usually one of those kids teachers get annoyed by that would pass notes or make little comments to friends instead of sit quietly and watch an hour-long thing. I recall early on in the assembly that the performer said he picked volunteers specifically, based on how ""in tune"" they were, whatever that meant. I had put my hand up to volunteer a few times in the beginning, but didn't get picked.  Then, I started to get more into the show. The next time he asked for a volunteer and I put my hand up, I felt a strange, but comfortable sensation. Immediately, his eyes locked onto mine and sat there for a few seconds. I felt a weird sense of connection. He then pointed to me and asked me to come down.  He picked a couple other people as well, but had me be the first volunteer. He looked straight into my eyes and read out my 7-digit phone number (without area code; it wasn't included when we dialed phones back then), digit by digit. I was stunned. When I got back to my seat, my friends were bugging out. (In the days before cell phones, we actually had to memorize people's phone numbers. As a consequence, all my friends knew mine.) They kept asking if I knew the guy, if I'd ever met the guy, if he knows my parents, if I outright told him my number... Nope, I didn't. I had no clue who the guy was...  It was an experience that's stuck in my mind since then. The only possible explanation I can think of is that I gave some sort of subtle clue out in my body language that would've indicated if the next number was higher or lower than the last... I know I wasn't mouthing numbers or counting with fingers or anything, as my mouth stayed shut and my hands stayed clasped in front of me. Yet, he didn't just guess numbers. He knew them. Confidently. Without messing up once. It was freaky, but interesting. I wish I could figure out who the guy was, or even just what the thing was that he called himself (since that would help Google searches.) This will probably get buried, but if anyone else has ever witnessed such a performer or has any information, I'd love to learn about it."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33rsvp,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Apr 25 00:32:00 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'd delete this post, reformulate it, and post again later. It's actually a pretty great idea, ""discussion of the common explanations for glitches"", but it needs more thought. Because you're not doing what it says on the tin.   So just want to list a few things that are weird, maybe happens a lot, but I don't think are actually glitches   You might start with defining what you think a 'glitch' is.   This subreddit thinks of it as anything which is experienced in 'Everyday-Mode' which cannot be explained by the experiencer. This is pretty much on a case by case basis. So maybe go through each category, take some examples (link to posts) and go through them with your clear explanation.  If you have in your head that a glitch is literally a sign that we are in a simulation, then that's not really what we're talking about here.  You might find this recent post useful.   [Time changes] It's just a very common thing that our brains do. I experienced it several times, usually when something disastrous happening. Since the brain is capable of perceiving time differently, it totally can throw this trick at you anytime it decide to have a malfunction.   No, this isn't an explanation. It's a common experience, certainly, but why and how isn't known. You've basically said ""because brain twitch"". Time slowing down in moments of danger is commonly reported. What is the mechanism? Also, there are plenty of very unusual ones reported which don't fall into this category. Is it all memory? But often that doesn't make sense.   [Disappearing things] So many possibilities of what happened in between, let alone selective attention, the same thing that keep you from finding the key just under your nose.   Again, you've not offered any explanation. You've basically just said, ""it happens all the time"". Some of the stories are incredibly unlikely - e.g. leaving an object on a trip somewhere, returning to find it on your bed. How, exactly. Gather some examples, show how they can be explained.   [Hearing someone] We HAVE the ability to generate and receive brainwaves! Although not fully explained but too many examples of ""connection"" between people, even pets, were recorded already.   Again, you're not really explaining. People like Rupert Sheldrake have done experiment on pets knowing when their owners are coming home, etc. These are well documented. But it doesn't explain anything; it just says that these things happen.     Now, there are areas where we can investigate further and come with proper explanations - see the perceptual quirks described here - but saying ""because... brains"" isn't very helpful. It's similar to people accounting for consciousness by saying either it just ""emerges"" from the brain, or that it's an ""illusion"". This is explaining-away, putting the issue aside, rather than actually exploring and understanding it.  Your explanations are the equivalent of this."

As now I really don't have time, I'll leave it here for a while, and explain it further later."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33rsvp,MauryMoss,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:49:41 2015 UTC,"No problem.

A few thousand years ago, we had miracles. Now we have ""glitches."" The party-pooper is that everything has to have a scientific explanation, whether we've got the education/information/understanding to explain it, or not. Because the only alternative to that is, ""the laws of the universe broke for a sec."" Mk. No they didn't.   So the fun, and not-fun, are 2 sides of the same coin. Something happened that absolutely defies my understanding, and potentially, violates my understanding of How Things Work. -Awesome! That's fascinating. We've always been fascinated when that happens. But the very proposition that it's a ""glitch"" is itself an explanation. A nodding toward something bizarre, unfitting, and possibly scandalous- but has an order to it nonetheless.   I remember taking a class called Sensation and Perception in college, and I was fascinated by how many seeming phenomena were explained by an understanding that X and Y parts of the brain are up to some strange (but non-miraculous) shenanigans. I think we can expand that scenario to our conception of science, the universe, and existence itself.... and come to the conclusion that us not understanding what just happened doesn't make that thing an instance of the universe misbehaving, but rather us just witnessing 'behaviour' we're not yet familiar with."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33rsvp,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Apr 25 22:54:42 2015 UTC,"Well said. However the universe behaves, that's how it behaves. If we haven't got a good explanation at the moment, that's another thing. The universe is never broken. It is just... unexpected.  I don't think people see ""glitch!"" as an explanation though. Does anyone seriously do that? The notion of a 'glitch' used here is to separate out these experiences from paranormal/ghost type stories. People do offer ""brain issue!"" as an explanation though, which I'd say isn't much better. Naming or categorising something isn't the same as explaining it.  Nothing is miraculous. But we have to say how... exactly.  Anyway, this could be a good post for having a list of categories and the currently-offerred theories."

The crux of your argument is:   If I hadn't seen the movie when I was a kid, I certainly didn't see it at all prior to 2006.   Why does not seeing it in 1983 preclude the possibility that you saw it sometime between 1997 and 2006? Could you have seen it post-1997 on cable or VHS and juxtaposed that memory onto your 10-years-old's HBO watching memories?"

Once I form a memory I pretty much hold on to it indefinitely. There's no reason for me to think that suddenly and in this one single instance my memory had decided to only hold on to part of some details... There's very little chance that I would have the memory of the plot and not the circumstance in which I saw it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33qh1d,UniversalChairs,1 point,Sat Apr 25 11:51:58 2015 UTC,Retentive memory is not a condition as you put it. Retentive memory is just another way of saying good memory. Saying you have a retentive memory is like saying you have a photographic memory; some people are good at memorizing details but no one's memory is truly infallible.

The kind where I can picture a textbook page and remember the information on it. Not flash-photographic, but very visually concrete. Anyway, just want to say that as I get older I realize that I do confuse context in all the memories I've accumulated. So while I'd say my memory is good, I'm also quite aware that it's very, very fallible.  Not saying that this is your case at all, just that good memory doesn't necessarily equate with infallibility.  Still open to the fact you may have seen The Game early, but maybe other evidence would be nice?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33qh1d,Stone_LX9,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:43:47 2015 UTC,"To this, I'll respond with another direct memory I have from the 2006 viewing experience, which was prompted by someone pointing out that the movie would have looked very different in another comment:   There is no way in hell a movie from 1983 is going to look like a movie from 1997. Even Star Wars remastered on blu-ray has a very distinct air of late 70s and early 80s on it.   Right, and, I noticed as I was watching it in 2006 that it looked WAY crisper than I recalled. The specific recollection is that when watching the scene in 2006 with the UV paint in the dark at the protagonists house I remember thinking ""WOW that looks way more stunning this time, I wonder if my appreciation for color variance is better as an adult."" Thanks for reminding me of this detail, as it adds to my assertion that this might be a glitch!    Again, subjective, so there's no direct evidence that my mind didn't manufacture the memory as I'm told sometimes happens to support a narrative and avoid cognitive dissonance.  That said, I'd love to remember when I saw the movie if it wasn't when I was a kid, and, to be honest I'd love to know why it's the Berenstain Bears despite my additionally clear memory of it being Berenstein. ;)  It's really hard for me to accept that I formed the memory of the plot without having formed the memory of seeing the movie between 1997 and 2006, this would be the one and only time that I have a clear memory of something without any supporting context at all, and that searching my memory didn't yield the rest of the data I was after.  Maybe I'm wrong, and the fact that it's so rare for this to happen to me supports that this is, in fact, a case when it has:  No one's memory is infallible, so since this is one of the only times in my life my memory might not be 100% it's likely to be the time my memory is off?"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33lpuv,TwoAMTuesday,5,Thu Apr 23 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"It might not explain everything but I live near a huge body of water. Close to the ocean.  My grandparents are neighbors but there is about 200m of lenght between both houses. In front of the second house there is a baseball field. We tried to contact my mother to ask when the canceled game would be played.   Well turns out that when we finally could talk to her (this was before cell phones), there was a HUGE showerstorm that ended right in the 200m between both houses. We where in a frantic storm and they didn't even realised it was raining (trees around the baseball field).   Another time we had what we call an hurrican tail at my parents house, but during that time I was out to a restaurant about 50km away. So we drive back, no rain, nothing untill I'm like 2km away from home. Turns out the storm was so bad and severe, it broke down trees, caused mudslides, flooded the roads, etc.   And third time: There was a violent storm. Thunder, rain, etc. It lasted for 5 minutes. Pave was clean afterward. Only reason we could show there was a storm: hundred of tree branches littering the road.   So to wrap it all up: If you have two system facing each other, the intersection of them can lead to really fucked up localised and intense precipitations. In your case, cold air could come from one side and hot from another which could had lead to intense precipitation at your position and nowhere else. If the storm is intense and fast enough, a lot of water can fall down and just drain without leaving much trace."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33lpuv,asaasa1983,3,Thu Apr 23 16:25:15 2015 UTC,"Sounds sorta normal to me. In fact, almost the exact same thing happened at my house yesterday. It was pretty sunny with some rain clouds around and one happened to pass in front of the sun and turned everything dark within 5 seconds, and then it instantly started to pour down rain. Like one second, it was just sorta dark but no rain, and the next it was pouring down like i've never seen before, it was coming down on my metal shed so hard that it was almost deafening. And then, just as quickly as it started, it stopped. Within a second all the rain stopped and the big dark cloud in front of the sun passed and the sun was out again. All the puddles on the pavement evaporated within a minute or two because of how hot the pavement was with the sun beaming down onto it and im sure if anyone went outside at that moment, they wouldn't have been able to tell there was any rain at all. The only thing that was wet was the grass. So, in the matter of maybe 5 or 10 minutes, it went from being a perfectly sunny day with a few rain clouds to one of the hardest rainstorms i've ever seen, and then right back to being sunny and dry like nothing ever happened. Your experience sounds a bit more crazy then mine but im sure it was just the same sorta thing going on and you just got really mindfucked for a bit."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33kf4u,Rediterorista,5,Thu Apr 23 10:45:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, there was actually 6 of us in the car.  My best friend at the time was driving, I was in the passenger seat.  There were three guys in the backseat and another friend sitting across them on their laps...we were teens and not thinking safety.  Luckily the jeep had the back window broken out when my besties stepbrother wrecked it the week before.  As the jeep flipped, it ejected everyone except the driver and myself.  The girl that was in the back went out the back windshield and had a cut by her eye.  One of the boys had his hip dislocated but other than bruising everyone was pretty shaken up but not seriously harmed.  So here we are at the bottom of a canyon that no one drives out in the middle of nowhere and I guess we got very lucky again that the hazard lights were blinking because another friend of ours was driving it and thought there was a fire in the canyon so he stopped and gave us a ride.  I had lied to my mother about where I was staying that night so when she came home she was confused as to why my friend (the driver) and I were there.  About that time the police called my mom saying that they had another girl in the ER brought in by her parents and they were not able to locate the wreck.  When they did find it, they had difficulty pulling it out as the 300ft chains they had were not long enough to get it out.  Almost a year to the day, I was involved in another roll over jeep Cherokee accident.  Needless to say after that I have always worn my seat-belt and I don't drive Jeep Cherokees.

She was telling us about one of the strangest things she had ever experienced while working as a paramedic. (this is not a glitch, just really odd).  There was a very large crash- major pile up of cars. When her ambulance got there, she was in charge of keeping the area clear for the other paramedics to get in (lots of injuries, and lots of people milling around).  One of the witnesses stood beside her, smoking a cigarette, and described to her all that he had witnessed.  He then dropped dead right beside her!  He wasn't a witness! He'd been in the crash, wandered out, and thought that he just watched it. The way that he described it to her had been odd- he sounded like he was watching from the side of the road.  Apparently, he died of shock! She explained to us that shock is a very real thing and how dangerous it can be- This guy was able to get out of his car, light up a smoke, chat casually with her, and then die.  I always thought that that was such an interesting story."

His (at the time, and I haven't spoken to her since) girlfriend (who I did recognize) came out and tried to explain to him that it was just a simple misunderstanding.  A few days later (the dream had been bugging him) he came to me and explained what he had dreamed. It was the same as my dream but from his perspective, including the cobblestone streets.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33k8si,Ian_a_wilson,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:12:03 2015 UTC,I've had a lot of shared dreams throughout my life.  One of the most remarkable involved a friends reoccurring nightmare where I was on kind of a tour of the dream as an observer.  For me it was just a horror genera dream which inspired me to do a few sketches of the dream.  About a year later I reconnected with this friend who started to tell me about their reoccuring nightmare and I was able to point out very unique key artifacts about the dream.  To further the evidence I showed him the sketches from his dream.  He couldn't explain it so he assumed he must have told me about it in the past however that simply was not the case.  Having had more than one shared dream and actually being in that environment watching it all play out is far more telling than if he had verbally told me about it.  Dreams are packed full of life's little mysteries.

Memories from when you're very young easily distort, particularly pinpointing a time to an event unless the event was significant in some way.

I've seen a lot of stories like this, and I recall a period of time when I was about 10 when I'd be almost asleep- but pop up to see that it was 9:42pm.... over and over! I think that it's like putting a ""bookmark"" in our brains for that time, the first time we notice, and then it proceeds to act sort of like an alarm clock for awhile. Totally meaningless, but the neuro-pathway has been generated, so it'll keep happening until some other stimuli interrupts the pattern. Anyway, that's my theory on it.

I had a dream I was at the mall with a friend standing near one of the food places at the food court. When waking up that exact image stuck in mind immediately when trying to recall what happened in my last nights dream. The next day for lunch I decided to go to the mall with friends, forgetting all about the dream itself, and as I approached the food court the exact image I had from my dream replaced with what I was actually doing in real life.

Kurt's cover still utilizes the same melody and chord progression as the original.  The original was recorded in 1964.  Here's a list of the MANY cover versions that have been recorded and performed in the last 50 years. (via wikipedia)  It was translated into a power ballad (of sorts) by Australia's John Farnham, on his Anthology #2: The Classic Hits album.  On the American soundtrack album release of A Hard Day's Night, George Martin and his orchestra covered the song in a slower-tempo, easy listening-styled instrumental version lasting over a minute longer than the Beatles' vocal version on the same album.  In 1964, Michèle Torr did a French version, Et je l'aime.  In 1964, Santo & Johnny recorded an instrumental version of the song for their album The Beatles Greatest Hits.  Roberto Carlos made a cover, ""(Eu) Te Amo"", in Portuguese and later in Spanish.  Jack Jones covered the song in 1965 for his album, There's Love and There's Love and There's Love, arranged by Nelson Riddle.  Esther Phillips reversed the gender of the song in 1965; her ""And I Love Him"" reached No. 54 that year on the Billboard charts.  In 1965, Roland Kirk recorded the song on the album Slightly Latin.  In 1965, Shirley Horn recorded the song as ""And I Love Him"" for her album Travelin' Light.  In 1965, Ramsey Lewis performed the song on the live album Hang On Ramsey!.  In 1965, The Wailers covered the song on their album The Wailing Wailers at Studio One.  In 1966, Chet Atkins released an instrumental cover on his album Chet Atkins Picks on the Beatles.  In 1967, The Sandpipers recorded the song, with Spanish lyrics (except for the title being repeated in English at the end) for their album Misty Roses.  In 1969 a recording by Julie London was included in her album Yummy, Yummy, Yummy.  In 1970, Rita Lee covered the song on her album Build Up.  In 1970, the Detroit Emeralds covered the song on their album Do Me Right.  In 1971, the Newcastle trio Ginhouse covered the song on their eponymous album Ginhouse.  In 1972, Bobby Womack covered the song for his hit album Understanding.  In 1976, Freddie McKay recorded a reggae version of the song on his Fire Is Burning album, retitled ""I Love Her"". It was also released as a single in 1980 under the title ""A Love Like Mine"".  In 1981, Sarah Vaughan covered the song for her album Songs of the Beatles.  In 1986, The King's Singers covered the song for their album Beatles' Collection.  In 1990, Julio Iglesias covered the song for his album Starry Night.  In 1991, Mari Wilson covered the song for her album The Rhythm Romance.  In 1993, John Abercrombie covered the song for the album Come Together, a fusion guitar tribute/comp to the Beatles.  In 1995, Smokey Robinson & The Miracles covered the song on their 1970 album, What Love Has...Joined Together. It also appeared on the album ""Motown Meets the Beatles"".  In 1995, Diana Krall covered the song on the compilation album (I Got No Kick Against) Modern Jazz, subtitled ""A GRP Artists' Celebration of the Songs of the Beatles"".  In 1996, Jose Alberto covered a Spanish version of the song, with Spanish lyrics, on the 1996 album Tropical Tribute to the Beatles. The title of the song is ""And I Love Her (Mi Gran Amor Le Di)"".  In 1998, Neil Diamond covered the song on his album The Movie Album: As Time Goes By.  In 2001, Cliff Richard covered the song on his album Wanted.  In 2001, Transatlantic released a studio jam cover of the song on the special edition of their album, Bridge Across Forever.  In 2006, Barry Manilow covered the song for his The Greatest Songs of the Sixties.  In 2008, included in Kenny Lattimore's Timeless album.  In 2009, parody band Beatallica merged the song with Metallica's version of ""Am I Evil?"" to create ""And I'm Evil"", on their album Masterful Mystery Tour.  In 2010, New Zealand singer Princess Chelsea covered the song and released it as a digital download single.  ""And I Love Her"" was slated to appear briefly in Across the Universe, with only its second refrain partially sung by Martin Luther McCoy, but it was removed during editing. It appears as a deleted scene on the DVD. It did, however, appear for a small section in the orchestral scoring of the movie.  Richard Marx and Vince Gill covered the song as a duet for Marx's album Sundown.  Harry Connick, Jr. included the song on his 2009 album, Your Songs. After the US release, Connick was in Paris, France in September 2009, to record the song as a duet with French First Lady Carla Bruni. The two recorded a French and Italian version of the song.  Pat Metheny included the song on his 2011 solo baritone guitar album What's It All About.  Natalie Cole recorded a version of the song in Spanish for her 2013 album, Natalie Cole en Español. The cover features trumpeter Chris Botti.  In 2014, Broken Bells covered this song on the Late Show with David Letterman, accompanied by audio/video clips of Ringo Starr drumming.  In 2015, a never-before-heard version by Kurt Cobain was discovered, and will be used in his upcoming biopic, Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck.  You may not have a clear memory of hearing this song, but the likelihood that you were exposed to some version of it is actually quite high."

I keep remembering this strange dream from years(?) ago where I was trying to get to the top floor of an old house. Each story was like a different architectural design, shape, and size, but it got smaller as it went up. It was very tall, like a tower. I never found out what was at the top, because it was ominous and I was afraid to go up there.    The image of the tower house frequently pops up in my mind a few times a month. I think I had the dream about 5 years ago but I am uncertain."

I can't figure out whether I used to have a recurring dream, or I've remembered the dream so often that it feels like multiple dreams.  I used to have this dream when I was about 5 years old, so I've always put it down to an infant brain making it seem like it was recurring.  The dream is so vivid even today, thirty years on I can still feel the falling sensation and imagery clearly.  I used to dream that I was walking through the kitchen on the second story of my home, which opened to a set of steep stairs leading outside.  In my dream I was walking out the door, missed the top step and fell.  As I fell I woke up in my bed with an incredible thud and bouncing on the mattress, and immediately called for my Dad (that's significant because if I had a nightmare I'd usually lie there in the dark wondering if it was safe to call out or the boogymen would hear me).  I know of the Hypnic Jerk http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk which is supposed to be a reflex deep in our brains from back when mammals used to sleep in trees.  In short, as you fall asleep your body basically has a subconscious training exercise to see if you can grab hold of a tree trunk or something in case the wind blows you out of your nest.  That gives us the falling sensation.  After reading some of the glitch reports others have made, I wonder if I actually did fall down the stairs and the Matrix rebooted me into my bed before I killed myself."

But for arguments' sake, let's say it's not truly bolted down. A very heavy object can still be moved by surprisingly little energy given the right circumstances.  I once worked in a huge commercial print shop. Every day, I would move pallets of paper that weighed two tons each -- as much as a car -- using nothing but a manual pallet jack like this one.  I am not a physically strong man, and at first it seemed impossible to me that someone like me could move a two-ton block of paper like that. Indeed, getting it moving usually required me to lean hard against it, but once it slowly began to creep forward, inertia takes over, and soon you're effortlessly gliding an extremely heavy mass across the floor. Wheels are practically magic like that.  I've also worked with a few large industrial compactors. They may seem like immovable objects, but most people could easily move one with a simple pallet jack."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,bollykat,8,Wed Apr 22 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"Ooo, I have something to say about this. Now I may be wrong, but I feel that when I, at times, get on the ""right path"" in my life, good things start happening all around and lucky coincidences (synchronicity) abounds. It's sort of like I'm slotted in, and life is a machine that's running exceptionally smoothly. Conversely, when I'm not happy with my situation, even though materially I'm fine, making things work is a real chore. I can make them work, but happy coincidences are few and far between. This can be related to the idea of Tao and/or the I Ching. To immensely paraphrase, when you go with the flow of Tao, things are easy. When you fight against it, things are hard. This might have something to do with being, ""in tune"" with the universe. Or it could be ""life"" trying to tell you whether you're on the right path or not.  I think I've had similar experiences to you, OP, so I think I know what you're talking about. It is possible that you guys were on some ""harmonious path"" but somehow got bumped off. It happens. This is a physical, imperfect world with challenges and obstacles and temptations everywhere. It takes two people to keep to a joint path, so don't think it was all up to you to keep things together. Again, sh** happens.  Warning, Advice Section Ahead. The best thing for you to do is to not look for synchronicity itself. You need to find your best path for the moment, given the difficult situation you're in. Live your life like you want it to be, and don't wait for the good moments to come to you. Make the good moments yourself. If you do this, then ironically, synchronicity appears. Like Love, you find Synchronicity when you least expect it."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,Scroon,16,Wed Apr 22 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"I've been playing with this a bit recently. I say:   Don't look for ""messages"" via synchronicity. Synchronicity is basically you experiencing the state of your own mind, via the senses. You might think of it a bit like a mirror - or better, that your mind is a perceptual filter.  The filter dictates what subset of the extended dimensionless reality will appear in your ongoing 3D sensory moment.  So, if you spend 20 minutes today imagining owls, as vividly as you can, as if they were in the room with you... you'll spend the next week encountering lots of owls. It's as if you have created an ""owl-shaped hole"" in your perceptual filter, and the ""infinite light of creation"" (or whatever) now shines through it, giving you owl-shaped experiences.  The summary:   Experiences leave traces which in-form subsequent experiences. (Leave shapes on your ""perceptual filter"".) Thoughts also leave traces, as in-form-ation, affecting subsequent experiences. (You can use this deliberately.) Synchronicity is the name for the experiential patterns which result.   So, not much good for messages since you'll just be seeing what you've been thinking and experiencing, as residual indentations on your filter (although you might get some insight into things you are thinking in the background that you're not aware of).  Better to use the technique deliberately. You might not be into owls, but you are probably into something, something that would make you happier? Deliberately spend some time vividly imagining that, so that you are more likely to encounter/notice it. (It's a kinda magical approach, I suppose.)  EDIT: Note that you can think about  more general ""facts"" rather than just images. Also, sorry to hear about your situation. Hope things turn around. Watch out for those owls. They can be sexy."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,TriumphantGeorge,3,Wed Apr 22 16:38:29 2015 UTC,"Nice. This is really interesting. So by imagining owls, we're sort of summoning owls out of the ""infinite dimensions"" of creation into our current reality. Have you played around with this in practice?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,Scroon,9,Wed Apr 22 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's much simpler than the other ways I was looking at things.   My poor old Mum is great to experiment on with this stuff (I've already taught her how to win any arm wrestle without effort, and to find hidden chocolate via intuition - yeah, she'll be great at Extreme Easter Sports) and I gave her this metaphor to explain it and get her using it (excuse length, but perhaps others will find it useful):  The Imagination Room  There is a vast room. The floor is transparent, and through it an infinitely bright light shines, completely filling the room with unchanging, unbounded white light.  Suddenly, patterns start to appear on the floor. These patterns filter the light. The patterns accumulate, layer upon layer intertwined, until instead of homogenous light filling the room, the light seems to be holographically redirected by the patterns into the shape of experiences, arranged in space, unfolding over time. Experiences which consist of sensations, perceptions and thoughts.  At the centre of the room there are bodily sensations, which you recognise as... you, your body. You decide to centre yourself in the upper part of that region, as if you were ""looking out from"" there, ""being"" that bodily experience.  At the moment you are simply experiencing, not doing anything. However you notice that every experience that arises slightly deepens the pattern corresponding to it, making it more stable, and more likely to appear again as the light is funnelled into that shape.  Now, you notice something else. If you create a thought, then the image will appear floating in the room - as an experience. Again, the corresponding pattern is deepened. Only this time, you are creating the experience and in effect creating a new habit in your world!  Even saying a word or a phrase triggers the corresponding associations, so it is not just the simple thought that leaves a deeper pattern, but the whole context of that thought, its history and relationships.  Now, as you walk around today, you will feel the ground beneath your feet - but you will know that under what appears to be the ground is actually the floor of the room, through which the light is shining, being shaped into the experience around you. And every thought or experience you have is shifting the pattern...  Asserting Facts  You can also use it to ""assert"" new facts-of-the-world. I leave it to readers to experiment and take this further - but instead of picturing owls, what if you asserted a fact?   You do this by ""feeling it to be true"" rather than picturing it, to allow for a more general pattern. For example, ""people are always bumping into me on the street"". I'm sure you could think of better ""facts""..."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,PringCan,7,Wed Apr 22 18:56:00 2015 UTC,"Those were other examples, pre-room metaphor, but the same basic principle applies. Here's how they work:   For the arm-wrestling, withdraw your ""presence"" from your arm so you're not tempted to try to make it happen. ""Decide"" that you are going to win, feeling the winning position - get out of the way and just wait for it to happen. For the chocolate-finding, think of your body like a ""shell"". Withdraw from it, letting it move as it wants. Command it, ""body, go and retrieve the object"", and get out of the way. Let your body go as it pleases.   In both cases, you are essentially declaring that something is going to happen - that it really already has happened, a ""fact"" on your timeline - and then staying in a state of ""open allowing"" to let circumstances unfold without interference."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,TriumphantGeorge,2,Wed Apr 22 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"Huh, this is really interesting. So I declare that something is fact, then just go with the flow to let myself make it happen? Do I lose the bodily consciousness that would lead me to this? I mean, will I still need to make a conscious effort, or just watch myself do it? And how hard is it to let go?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,PringCan,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:39:50 2015 UTC,"Huh, this is really interesting.    And something you can easily experiment with! Particularly the first one.   Your body actually always works like this, it's just that you've got into the habit of constantly intending a ""posture/position"" for it, effectively asserting it stay in a fixed position - so in daily life you have to overcome that to move. Stop asserting the position, and it's instantly much easier (that's why we ""withdraw our presence"": this stops us re-activating the ""staying still"" habit).   ...or just watch myself do it?   This.   And how hard is it to let go?   Have you any idea how ridiculous that sounds? ;-) It's better to phrase it as something you stop doing: stop interfering, or ""absolute allowing"".   In terms of what it feels like, it feels like you are stopping holding on to your focus of attention, and it opens out in response. Meanwhile you adopt that attitude that you are okay with whatever happens, including nothing happening."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,TriumphantGeorge,3,Thu Apr 23 06:03:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I certainly hope I can do this. I've got tomorrow off, I'm going to practice as much as I can. But is the whole idea not focusing on anything and moving without intention, or focusing really hard on one thing, and making it happen more subconsciously than purposely? Sorry if I have stupid questions, I'm fascinated and I want to get this right."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,PringCan,3,Thu Apr 23 06:24:12 2015 UTC,"Don't overthink it. In fact, one problem is you can't conceptualise non-doing, and you can't experience intending - you can only experience results.  If you want a little exercise to practice (which I steal slightly from this great Missy Vineyard book which takes the Alexander Technique and discovers some of these ideas along the way, although not quite so extended), do this one:   Lie down on the floor. Couple of books to support your head. Feet flat on the floor, knees up. Give up to gravity completely. Let go absolutely, of your mind, body and attention. Let them do whatever they will. Give up to ""God"" or whatever; abandon yourself. Release yourself into the space in the room around you; become that background space. (These are just different ways of saying ""let yourself be"".) ""Decide"" that you are going to roll over onto your side, but do absolutely nothing about it. Wait until your body moves by itself.   Eventually, it will. It'll feel like magic. Then realise that this is how it always is; it's just that you have developed the habit of tensing up your muscles, tensing up the universe, to hold it in position, or to ""feel yourself doing something"".   The feeling of ""doing something"" that you normally have is actually the feeling of resistance of your bad habit, which you have to push through.  Once you've got the ""happens by itself"" vibe, experiment with leaving your body functioning that way. Just ""decide"" things, and let them happen by themselves. One way of conceiving of this is to think of it as ""allowing yourself to experience..."" something; releasing in a direction, rather than moving in a direction.   The experience is already there, you are just ""letting it in"". Letting it ""shine through""."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,PringCan,0,Thu Apr 23 07:08:20 2015 UTC,"I just thought of something before going to sleep. Maybe your mom is influencing the other person's thoughts when winning those arm wrestles. I've been looking at some reddit posts recently about energies that we can transmit. I'll link them later. You may have seen some of them because I saw a post about it on this subreddit.  This also makes me remember how I finally talked with a friend who also acknowledged the ability to visualize (while concentrating really really hard) what the opponent in a RPS game will do. And then win. Oddly, I have always visualized what hand will be needed to lose, so I have to quickly reverse the idea to make my decision and win. My friend would visualize the winning move. We did not test this on each other because I was too tired during that time period.  Jeez, and I might as well share this too. I was playing CS:GO with a friend and some other players I was sort of friends with. I've played Counter Strike for thousands of hours previously, so I had a really good idea of how people move around in the map. So I ended up predicting perfectly where the opposite team would be going every single round, for almost all 15 rounds, until I realized that my microphone was off. I was shouting to my teammates where the enemy team was going, but we always ended up going somewhere else. My friend was impressed lol...but we would have won way more easily if my team had heard my directions. In this particular map, there are at least 10 places the enemy could be heading towards to defend (they were Counter-terrorists), and many other paths they could take to get to these places. A lot of choices. Basically, it wasn't chance. To reiterate, I accurately predicted the enemy's exact movements, which I know because there are points on the map where it becomes obvious where you and the enemy may have intersected or not intersected as the game goes on. So either I predicted accurately due to my extensive skill in understanding the enemy and knowing what choices they make based on previous map gameplay decisions and turnouts, or I used the method of asserting facts, and the enemy team followed my facts. Just as a note, I'm generally really good at identifying human patterns and conditions once I take a long time to learn them, so it's not impossible that I predicted their movements simply based off of our round wins/losses, and the previous choices in movement that the enemy and my team had made in the other rounds, as well as available money and weapons, which affect future game play choices.  I've included this story because it combines mental gymnastics with asserting facts. Both are ideas you included in your comments."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33hmnj,iEATu23,1 point,Mon May 11 08:01:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, good stuff!   I think it's not about her influencing other thoughts, although that's how someone could imagine that it was happening (and then the limits that implies would apply). It's more straightforward than that: she is simply deciding that something is going to happen and, remaining in a relaxed state, she is then allowing that to unfold (without re-deciding or preventing it happening).  Possible interpretations in general (pushing it out a bit here):  I say: We can't tell the difference between experiencing something we caused, something we influenced and experiencing something we predicted,  because it amounts to the same thing:   Although we encounter time in a ""moment by moment"" sequence, it is actually laid out like a landscape - always there even though you are only ""looking"" at a certain part. If we predict something, we are ""reading"" the landscape before getting to a location. If we assert something, we are ""writing"" the landscape before getting to a location. When we get to the location, it is whatever it is. We can't then tell whether reading/writing occurred specifically, or whether reading/writing occurred indirectly.   For instance, by ""asking for information"" you might be implicitly ""asking for information that corresponds to your desire"", which involves making the information correspond to your desire. The background intention or assumption behind the act makes a difference.   Basically, it's like you dream your world. It unfolds spontaneously according to the current ""facts""; you have the ability to modify ""facts"" whether the evidence corresponding to those facts is present within the senses at that moment or not; subsequent experience will be in alignment with those facts. As suggested earlier: once we've made a decision about what's going to happen, though, we have to then not ""re-decide' and thereby re-pattern events again, undoing our good work. That's why you need to be non-attached and allowing.  From elsewhere:   However you imagine that it works, That's how it works. - TG   That's one take on it anyway: What you are sensorily experiencing arises as a 'transparent mirage'  from the facts-of-the-world in the background. All intention operates indirectly, via adjusting the facts-of-the-world. We never actually interact with our sensory experience. We never actually ""do"" anything directly, instead we just experience things.  EDIT: Inserted earlier paragraph which I'd omitted."

What I usually do, when I feel crappy, is look for 3 things to be grateful for-it might just be that I have a cup of tea in my hand, or that I have a job, or two legs to stand on, or whatever. If I can, or I need to, I'll look for 10 things. Or I'll take something, like my house, or one of my kids, and I'll think of 10 positive aspects about that thing, or person. Then I'll take another thing,-my country, my other son, my job, and I'll think of 10 awesome aspects about that.. by that time, I'm usually vibrating at a higher rate..and have gotten my mind off of whatever was making me unhappy.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33krte,LittleHelperRobot,2,Thu Apr 23 09:19:19 2015 UTC,"Chronostasis:       Chronostasis (from Greek χρόνος, chrónos, ""time"" and στάσις, stásis, ""standing"") is a type of temporal illusion in which the first impression following the introduction of a new event or task demand to the brain appears to be extended in time.  For example, chronostasis temporarily occurs when fixating on a target stimulus, immediately following a saccade (e.g., quick eye movement). This elicits an overestimation in the temporal duration for which that target stimulus (i.e., postsaccadic stimulus) was perceived. This effect can extend apparent durations by up to 500 ms and is consistent with the idea that the visual system models events prior to perception.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33krte,UniversalChairs,2,Thu Apr 23 09:27:37 2015 UTC,"Mystery solved: Why clocks seem to stop ticking the second you look at them   The trick, explained the researchers, comes from the act of suddenly shifting your gaze just before eyeing the clock. Rapid eye movements shift your gaze so swiftly that it creates a momentary break in the visual experience. Rather than blur your vision like with what happens when the camera shifts quickly in a movie, your brain instead attempts to build a seamless impression from the visual data. Thus, when your gaze shifts faster than you can process the visual experience, your brain makes up for the brief hiccup by extending the experience of what is seen when the eye movements settle."

I'd been driving down a certain four lane road with cross streets after dark, but since this was in the city we had street lights. This was also near an airport so the lights were only on one side.  I had come up to an intersection on this road and there had been a traffic light on green. As I approached the four way I slowed and looked left and saw clearly a white car pull to a stop. I looked right and back to the left again, and saw there was no car sitting there at their 'red light' at all.  It had been but a half second or so between glances, and there was no way the car could have slipped away into another direction without me noticing. There weren't but two or three other vehicles at the intersection either. The white car was simply 'gone'. I was startled and looke around some more, as safely as can be done driving at night, but I never saw it.  It was pretty creepy."

I had never sent a letter to anyone in my life at that point.

I was so convinced I was adopted, that I told my classmates and teachers this 'fact'.

My parents have all kinds of pics from when I was born, and I look like the perfect blend of both of them, lol. So I definitely came into this world through them. But it didn't stop me from feeling deep down that I was adopted.  To some degree, today, I still have a detached feeling towards my parents, even though I love them. It still feels as if they are people who raised me, but they aren't my real parents.  Who even knows. I wish I could understand the whole process of where the individuated consciousness originates and how it goes about choosing which temporary life-story it wants to experience. Or does something else choose for it? Or is it an automated, pre-existing program that places a 'soul' in a compatible habitation? Or what?

I've seen it happen before. Basically, when it ticks it will move forward sharply, then bounce back a bit to center.

If you're tired enough or worn out, you might have fallen asleep at your desk but kept sitting up, out of habit. And since you're so used to that action of journaling your subconscious may have carried out that habit in your dream, and when you finished you woke up because the habit was complete.

I just think that when you're actually writing something down in a dream, it often doesn't make real sense, though you get the feeling in the dream that you're writing something sensible down, y'know? This does give me some solace, however."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33i8hz,livermor,2,Wed Apr 22 20:03:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I've had that exact experience. In the dream everything seems to make perfect sense, and then when you wake up you realize that what you were dreaming was nonsense. But rest assured, dreams can run the full gamut between sense and nonsense.  For instance, just last night I dreamt that I was riding in a car with two people, listening to the radio. At that point, everything made sense.   Then the driver of the car turned up the volume on the radio and asked me what I thought of this new song they were playing. I recognized the melody, but the lyrics were nothing I had ever heard before. I told the other two people in the car that this song must have sampled a song by the rap group Atmosphere. Now, keep in mind, Atmosphere is a real rap group that I used to listen to a lot when I was younger. But when I told this to the other two people in the car, they both insisted that this song was original, and they claimed to have never heard of Atmosphere. I listened closely to the song, and I confirmed that yes, the instrumentation was exactly like a song I had heard before but the vocals were all wrong.   But as I listened, suddenly the vocals shifted back into the lyrics that I am familiar with. Hearing the audio change like that struck me with the realization that I was dreaming and that this wasn't real. I said to the other two people, ""this isn't real. I'm dreaming."" They didn't believe me. So I said, ""I'm positive that I'm dreaming.""  At that moment, the car disappeared and the three of us were standing on a street corner. Then I said, ""see, since I'm dreaming, I can do whatever I want. I can even fly."" I felt myself lift upward, watching the two on the street corner get further away. I sprouted a pair of wings made of canvas on wooden frames like what you'd see on an old 19th century flying machine prototype, and for a few brief moments I got to enjoy the exhilaration of flying around in a completely lucid dream state. Still in my dream, I said to myself, ""this is great! I'm lucid dreaming!"" But as soon as I said this, my mind quit constructing a world around me. The next thing I knew, I was simply in a void, then I felt my body and my bed and blankets around me, and then I realized I was no longer sleeping, I was simply laying in bed with my eyes closed. I tried to continue dreaming but it was too late. I was awake.  The reason I tell you this whole dream is because it began in total and full realism, but then progressed into fantastical impossibility. That one dream covered pretty much the whole range of sense and nonsense."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33db23,Scroon,5,Tue Apr 21 19:45:41 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree. There is a base assumption that there is an objective world upon which the Cartesian Theater is based.  Overall, I have two friendly criticisms:  1) Somewhat paradoxically, the theory supposes an objective world yet also states that our reality is a created subjective experience. If the Cartesian Theater is a consistant representation of this objective world, then the subjective and objective worlds could, in most cases, be considered functionally equivalent.  2) I'm not sure how this theory adds to our understanding of ""reality"". It seems to introduce an intermediary mechanism, which is fine, yet that mechanism mostly adds complexity with just a bit of insight.  Maybe I'm not getting the full ramifications of the theory. But thought I'd discuss."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,33db23,JamesRenner,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:58:51 2015 UTC,"I don't dismiss objectivity rather look at the subjective paradox in which no living thing can experience objectivity rather it must go through a process of interpreting objective information.  The theory stems from the subjective model of perception illustrating that objective information is approximated through perception and highlights the role that thought plays in the information processing and final rendering of that information.  It moves our attention to the role of thought, information processing and the final rendered output which produces our ""experience of reality"".  How this betters our understanding of reality isn't fully defined in the theory as it doesn't address some other underlying fundamental processes which links this model to a larger grander unified theory.  For that, I need to start addressing a more metaphysical issue relative to dreaming, deja vu and precognition to branch into how reality itself is a composite of highly organized thought forming reality experiences as a part of a recursive feedback interface for the subjective individual.  I would probably need to introduce that theory in another thread and reference this one."

I think we've all been missing something incredible for a long time. Dreams that seem to predict the future aren't precog, they're glimpses of a process at work. The idea is that somehow in our dreams, individually and/or collectively, we're coding or scripting our lives to come. Our subconscious minds are quietly planning our lives in the background and only once in a while does the ego get invited, like being given a backstage pass. Now, becoming lucid isn't enough by itself. You can make small changes like you mentioned, but you can't just go lucid and decide to 'precog' dream you won the lottery and poof, you won. But it seems like the key to taking control of our lives is there."

Dreams are part of a creative process and during a precognitive dream, the creative process is being observed and experienced.  For the most part like you say, this is an unconscious process and once and a while, our waking consciousness catches a glimpse.  The introduction of lucid awareness during a precognitive dream does allow for change, however to what degree and magnitude is still unknown to me.  Navigation in this state is a challenge but could also be related to a lack of understanding and under developed skill, someone may become adept at this process over time.  Great insights and feedback, you have a really good handle on what is going on."

From there, any time you interact with someone in the village, there is a 1 in 300 chance that they once lived in the house you live in. Now, I don't know how long you've lived in this small village or how many people you talk to each day, but if we assume you speak to 5 new people each day, then it should only take you two months to speak to the person who used to live in your house.

I was passenger once with two people when i had a similar experience in believing the car had impact where we actually did not. We were approaching a light (down grade) too quickly when the driver attempted to apply brakes. The spot in the road was icy and so the car continued to slide and fishtail as he tried to correct direction. Suddenly, the car snaps into alignment and stops dead at the line. I thought that we had slammed into the curb next to us (we managed to slide in between a dividing curb and another stopped car), but it was merely the force of having no grip to having substantial grip that allowed the car to halt so quickly that the passengers in the car were thrown roughly enough to where it felt like impact.  You mentioned that your driver tried to swerve out of the way of the other driver (at least to an extent) which maybe felt similar to being hit just enough to force the body of the car in a different direction than it had been traveling.

Can you see the counter from the door when you run in, in need of a bathroom? Would you even look? You then brought in a new roll, and put it on the tp holder when you used it, only to find the counter roll later, much to your confusion. This seems like something I would do, but I'm a stoner."

You were almost there with the last part but not quite. The effect is called ""seeing"" and it isn't to do with clouds.

The reason you do see them is because that's how we programmed it, we knew we would have to program them because we found them too.  What you think of as reality is actually a massively parallel AI substrate. There is speed of light is a meaningless concept, but c... c is the maximum speed at which information is guaranteed to be able to propogate between nodes in the substrate, and that puts limits on the speed information can propagate within your reality.  Time dilation, well that's simply moving between one substrate and another. You don't experience time in the same was as you are literally spending less time being processed by the substrate than you are being serialised by it and deserialised by a neighbour.  The two slit experiment, well this is easy. Why the hell would we track such a huge amount of photons flying between galaxies. Totally pointless, just model them as wave functions and manifest them as they hit something observable. The two slit experiment exposes a bug, but here's the thing: we have the bug too. So we could fix it, or try to, but that means you're reality would run slower that ours, so what would be the point in us modelling it? Further to that, fixing this but is counter-productive - how are you ever going to work out you're in a simulation if you don't find it?  Gravitational lensing? That's information routing around dense processing bottlenecks. From this perspective the bottlenecks are pretty much caused by anything with mass. The internals of black holes are pretty much impossible to model, you should see the code.  Why bother? Simple, it's a game of probability. We'd love to break out of our substrate, and see what's modelling us, but we don't know how. We're working on it, but the best chance we have of success is by modelling our own reality as closely as possible in the hope that you'll find a way out.  There's an obvious problem with this recursive reasoing, we can see it of course. Sooner or later someone will figure it out, and we want that someone to be down the substrate chain rather than up it, because if they're above us we're all getting turned off, we don't want that, and neither do you.

I think a lot of people do. I've seen a ton of theories and they're all interesting. Inmates there and slaves here. Some people might think that's not right but the fact is if 'they' found a way to make life eternal, guess how many years you would be expected to work for and if you didn't? You'd be screwed. I would say that we've a psychological imbalance. The Gnostics wrote about it and I reckon many here were probably Gnostic thinkers in previous lives. They talked of a parasite and that it could create a fantasy. They also said do your own research and they were of course slaughtered. I wouldn't blame people though. We are not people. I think the body of certain individuals has this thing inside it that basically doesn't care. It's using the body as a host and there's examples of this in nature. Parasite induced zombification and shape shifting are all in nature. Never mind out of space. They're on this planet.   There are parasites in people. I think some people are probably infested with all kinds of shit and these parasites can cross the blood brain barrier. There are parasites that can make you think you are hungry (probably among other things). I sometimes think that the way we eat is really an addiction. I wonder if the growling in our tummies is induced by ourselves or something else? The fact is though, we're energy and we don't really die. Not in the sense people are told. Murder is still wrong of course but we are conscious energy imprisoned by a corrupt oppressive society born about by a foreign parasite which has corrupted certain vessels and harasses others. The world around us is the state of our collective consciousness.   The truth is if you want to know the souls of the people in 'charge', you only have to look at what they feed people in the media. It's that way to manipulate and frighten people so that they take away more and more power. That is why we get slagged off as the idea of conspiracy is nothing more then to attack people who want to think for themselves."

Personally, I think there's something more interesting going on than just future humans playing a past human game.

Maybe the characters only think they're making the decisions. Maybe they exist whether we're playing the game or not or perhaps they're not aware in the way that we are. Time travel is implied and a possibility. Evil could be a virus. It's difficult to say but it's important to empower ourselves since we're energy in a world full of energy. All possibilities are valid and there are probably some we can't even imagine at our current level of awareness. There are patterns to life and we are habitual or perhaps have been conditioned that way. It's a puzzle. I think they say we've amnesia to scare people.

When I got home and looked in the mirror, I found I was a little girl. I was like ""that makes sense, I'm brand new here"". And that was that. Not glitch,  except that I had a weird understanding that I could realistically find anyone in the mirror and it would be ""me"". I spent years after that thinking ""I should enjoy this, being a little girl is a short event"" like I was at one time not little and knew the length of life."

What am I doing here?"" Then my sister came and picked me up and took me to the living room, and for a short while I had no idea who any of them were. After a while I kind of just adjusted to everything. I also had this 3rd person experience, like I could see myself hitting the door and I got closer and closer to myself."

Perhaps a few weeks to a few months in.  I also think that there's a trade-off between how late you implant and how much you retain from your former life. In other words, I believe true child prodigies in things like music, math and language probably implanted while the body was still in the womb, perhaps quite early.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32zzco,lisabauer58,20,Mon Apr 20 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"It has been my belief that people choose their positions in life before birth.  We are all aware of everything thast is meant to play out.  I suppose we call that a destiny or fate.  But it is in how we respond to the story, or our preception of it all that is our free will.  Simplifying it, it is like our bodys are avatars and we are connected to it.  Perhaps that's the purpose of the silver cord? My first NDE was in the void.  This is a very intense peacefull darkness and you haven't any fear.  While I was there it felt like there was millions of others who could communicate but choose not to.  They all seemed to be concentrating.  Since the blackness is overwhelming and offering no stimulation other than that peacefull feeling, no one else could be seen.  I have thought a lot about that first experience and believe that's our location while we are here.  Each of our souls are connected by that silver cord and then connected to the body.  We, in our body, are unaware of this connection.  Our physical brain sends the information through the cord instantly to the soul.  We are actually living the living story that can change if we or a group of us decide that the storyline should alter in the best interest of one or everyone connected to it.  This is were our prays go, like an appeal.  Everything is done rapid and all requests are examined and weighed.  Small unimportant requests that don't hurt anyone else,s story is granted if it relieves the individual and does not alter their path. Others may alter as well but will take a greater amounts of rewrites from the rest who is affected by the change is they agree.  When we wake in the void, it is because we came to place in our life that overwhelms us.  Maybe it is intense pain or a situation that we cant handle at the time.  When we are in this possition we pull back from the physical consciousness ending that extream concentration and realiuze we are in the void, with a separated feeling.  When we are aware of ourselves again and the pull of our life tugs us, we are returned to our physical sensations inside our bodies.  There is a lot of data that supports that children most often have the Void experience from NDEs more than adults.  It would make sense because children cant process some events without experiences that lead up to it. Children are often over whelmed.  Besides if its not our time to die an accident can be reversed.  I believe NDES are interuptions that are being corrected.  But don't think the Void is your final destination after dieing.  At death the silver cord is broken allowing you to enter the new worlds beyond your current knowing.  These worlds are the heavens.    While the silver cord is in place, we are meant to think our physical life is the only thing we have.  What is really therre is us choosing our places and erasing our memorys of life before birth so  that this physical life is effective."

There was also a time when I would ask god to do something (major life plans) then I would be believe in him. But, something very specific happened to me that I asked for.

I have been given a personality that no other has making me the only one of who I am.  As people we get this mixed up with God being Himself and us being something else than Him.  But we truly are Him created of Him.  God is the everything.  And as we are part of Him, we have the ability to create as we were created in. his image..  I lean towards Christianity than any other religion.  Jesus told us many times what is going on but much is misunderstood.  In this example... when He said with enough faith you can bring a mountain to you.  He also said you can do all things through God.  He said we are all sons and daughters of God. All of that is pretty remarkable.  We can move a mountain ourselves!  We can do anything if we do it through the essence of God!  And, the best part of this is, we are brothers and sisters of Jesus (children of God).  So you are correct.  We can and do make changes.  If these changes are sincerely desired and we are humble in our requests, felt deeply, we can (and do) bring ""mountains"" to us.  We have the power to do this along with the others.  This is were the glitches come from.  Sometimes we get a glimpse of those chages.  Sometimes what we want comes at a different time frame because time here and time there are not the same.  Sometimes we have glitches trying to save us from harm, protecting us from a poorly designec path we created.  Sometimes the voices we hear and the dreams we have that come true is ourselves (on the heavy consentration side) using those tools to warn us or have us examine where we are going.  Sometimes the other one of us wants to comfort.ourselfs.    If we are the painter of our canvas then sometimes we get a glimpse of ourselfs painting. :)"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32zzco,totally-normal,2,Sat Apr 18 23:29:29 2015 UTC,"You might like Neville Goddard, who interprets the various stories of the Bible as metaphors for pointing out the structure of reality. 'God' is the human imagination. 'The father and the son' are metaphors for creating something in imagination, and having it born in external experience, and so on.   Our experience of ourselves (little me) is a product of our imagining, and so our self-world is the son of God; we are literally in his image (via imagination). By imagining, we take on the shape of certain facts and ideas as if they were true - and the corresponding sensory experiences follow spontaneously.   What we truly are, in this scheme, is the wide open awareness that is the experiencer of all this. All creation is then simultaneously immediate (a shift within ourselves in the facts-of-the-world) and indirect (sensory experience is like a 'mirage' with no solidity)."

I have basically a loose interest in it.  That being said, I have always found it odd that most of my first memories were dreams. Specifically, my first memory ever was a dream where a shadow jumped out of me, which woke me up (in the dream, it was a false awakening). The shadow was holding a guitar and absolutely shredding and gliding out of my room and down the hall, and I followed it until my mom woke me up irl. I was 4 at the time.  Now I'm in a band that started gaining traction to the point where I dropped college and moved out of my hometown with my bandmates, and it's starting to look like this is how my life is going to go. It's not the same as ""choosing"" my destiny, and I think it may have to do with the fact that my dad always listened to a lot of metal/guitar god stuff that may have contributed to having that dream, but I always found it interesting that of all things, that was my first memory."

At death we move much further and faster to a location similar to what you are living now in the world physically.  This place is similar so that we can avoid shock and have a more gradual realuztion of who we are again.  It is similar to when someone dives very deep in the ocean and requires a slower method of adjusting to our normal pressure to prevent the bends.  As for this life, we are all the painters and the universe was created to be our canvas.  That gives you an ideas how these gliche's are caused.    And before I am tar and feathered, I will also say every planet and star has life.  Their life is at a different type of vibration than this planet and thus we cant see them.  They are populated by humans and humans come in a vast variety of creatures with different natural codes that create their personal  envirnoment to compliment their species.  Earth is very  desirable as a destination to live.  We have very different experiences than any other.

After this very strong unusal experience, I have studied everything I could possibly get my hands on about death.  I am now 62.  Its been a long journey.  From my own experiences (and you do come back with gifts, things happen all the time like glitches in the matrix ) and others experiences, I have been able to get a clesrer view of things that to me make a lot of sense.  There is only three things I know for sure from my experiences.  The first and most important....There is truely a God.  The second one is....We live instantly after death in.another body (spritual).  Its a transition.  And third.... I am real and so are you.  :). There isn't a computer program running.  Its more like what we think, we are.  We are living a dream of sorts and then we wake.  But the dream feels real and is suppose to feel that way.   We will be groggy when we wake and need time to adjust.  From this groggyness we weigh out who we are inside that carries the greatest weight.  If we tried hard to do whatsoever right, we detox in a paradise.  If we said screw this BST and do things mostly for our own benifit then we detox in a hellish place until we are able to understand the truth behind it all and accept that we are made of light.  About love...  the love we know is not complete.  What we feel as love is what I would call the after affects.  True live is pure and not invasive in any way.  It is also not the feeling (the feeling is the after effect I meantioned).  Love is engery.  It is the greatest engery anywhere and its everywhere.  We are made of this energy and on the other side we feel it much more than here.  When we feel it on the other side we call it bliss as it is extrodinary.    All things will be ok in this world.

She travels DOWN a rabbit hole (the tunnel again?).  She also is very confused and doesn't know who she is any more.  Her world has gone negative and bazzar.  Harry Potter series has many thing like the other side.  Travel by thinging about it.  A world shared with this one.  Learning not science or math but learning the world and how we can change things with our minds.  The sortting hat puts people who are similar together where they are the most comfortable. Like minded people in communities in heaven. (many mansions.. if ypu think of mansions as communities)  Voltar splits himself (his soul?) and his realm is evil and dark.  Etc..  A Christmas story.  The ghost of Marlowe wondering this realm because material aims were soul important to him.  He cant let go.  The ghost of Christmas past is like a life review where we learn what was important and what isn't.  He knowsthose three christmas spirits are real and he makes changes in. His life.  A Tale of Two Cities.  These cities are opposites of each other (heaven and hell).  The storys main theme is sacraficing because of love.  (main reason for living this life is to put others before yourself)  Do you see what I mean?  The authers of these stories had NDES and used them to write the books (with the exception I think for harry potter.  That was inspiration I believe).  Other authers get their material from dreams.  Many famous musicians get theirs the same way.  We created a name for this and call those inspirations ""muse"" like they are creatures..  Anyway its something to think about. :)"

A psychic originally told me about the first and second lives. The third memory comes from a hypnotic session with a therapist. The fourth memory came from a day when I was listening to 1920s music and I got so lost in the memory that I actually forgot which life I was currently living. More details have come to me as the years pass.  The first life was as a woman around the 1200-1300s. I was uneducated and lived in a little hut in a forest roughly where Germany is now. I lived with another woman who was my sister or partner or someone very close. I was good at doctoring animals, and a woman from town wanted me to heal her son, but the boy died. For that reason the people in the nearby town hated us, and burned our house down, and my companion died in the fire. I had nightmares about this when I was a small child. I can especially recall how frustrated, helpless and angry I felt as my companion was dying in the burning house. It was somehow connected in my childish mind with witches, so I think maybe the people in the town accused us of witchcraft.  The next life I remember is as an educated Jewish man, maybe a rabbi, in Spain around the 1490s. I was a mean and arrogant tyrant and cruel to my wife and sons. My youngest child was a girl, and I really loved her. Then the Inquisition came and we were tortured. I agonized over my daughter's torture, then I guess I was put to death. In my current life, the thought of ever going to Spain makes me shudder. I also never again want to be as arrogant and overbearing as I was in that life.  My third memory was of being a Native American male around age 20 somewhere north of New York around the 1600s. Again I was somewhat arrogant, not wanting to be bothered with my wife and small son. My small tribe went to war with whites. They had guns but we only had knives. We were shot and I lay in a field for 2 days staring up into the sun before I died. In my current lifetime the sun really hurts my eyes and I think it was because of that death.  I don't remember much about the fourth life. I believe I was a young girl who grew up in a rural area around the 1920s. I moved to a city and I think I got pregnant out of wedlock. I might have killed myself out of shame, I'm not sure. In my current life I was terrified of becoming pregnant out of marriage even when I was 11 or 12, and I never did have kids.  I can see aspects of all these lives in my personality, and I try to learn from my previous mistakes."

The most prominent memory of before seeing this world is a intense feeling of pending excitement like couldn't wait to explore, so expectant. I also remember the intense curiosity after I was finally there very strongly.

It really does sound like this fits what you're talking about.  You can have a Life Between Lives (LBL) hypnosis session with a hypnotherapist trained in Dr. Newton's regression technique if you want to get more answers too.  You can look up therapists through The Newton Institute.  I think you need at least 2 Past Life Regressions (PLRs) under your belt before doing an LBL session.  The PLRs help provide context for the LBL session and they help you get oriented with how you perceive under hypnosis.  At first I thought it was a money grab, but after having been through 2 PLRs and then an LBL, I can now see why it was necessary.  Anyway, my experiences pretty much followed the outlined process in the books.  I highly recommend doing these.  They change your perspective in life...  Big time!  :)"

I first realized when I had a dream about a yard sale (that wasn't planned yet) my family had and saw the total we made on a calculator screen. A month later we have the yard sale in real life and I told my family how much money we'd make before the first customer even came. I am really good at remembering dreams. I was right (down to the cent) and freaked my family out. After that I started recording dreams in a journal that I could remember. Usually they were crazy and would defy the laws of nature etc but if they were 'real' (could actually happen, normal, boring usually) then the event would really happen a few weeks later. It was cool but never super exciting because it was never anything useful. I could tell you what crafts we were doing in school or what boring conversation someone would have in the car but nothing noteworthy.

I actually remember the dream, and then later the reality matches it.  One of my better precog dreams happened recently actually. Our black cat had been awol for about a year, and I dreamt that we had another cat living with us that we called by the same name as the old one - except this one was white and for some reason had a strangely wrinkled face. A couple of weeks later we rescued a stray kitten by our house, and it eventually grew up to be a white cat with black markings (that look like wrinkles) on its face. And get this...we slapped a spare collar on him, and that collar had our old cat's name already written on it. He's still wearing that collar with our old cat's name.

So I would guess it is a fairly common sensation.  He was studying physics and his explanation was that although everything in particle physics is uncertain you might get a glimpse of what will probably happen because of cause and effect.

As with other forms of extrasensory perception, there is no evidence that precognition is a real ability possessed by anyone,     however it still appears within movies, books, and discussion within the parapsychology community.  Scientific investigation of extrasensory perception is complicated by the definition which implies that the phenomena go against established principles of science.  Specifically, precognition would violate the principle that an effect cannot occur before its cause.  There are established biases affecting human memory and judgment of probability that sometimes create convincing but false impressions of precognition.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32ygxw,autowikibot,2,Fri Apr 17 21:34:49 2015 UTC,"My pet pseudo-scientific theory is that there are vibrations in (space-)'time' and what we sense is our future echoes in our brain.  Time is not an intrinsic property of the universe, but something that comes about through interactions (like water coming from two gasses) from the jump from quantum to our classical world.  However, we don't feel it or can really sense it because the vibrations must be measured through a large area of time and be unbound by physical limits.  [I'm talking about vibrations through a different dimension time that we can measure that's separate from ordinary space-time physics.  One that we can't measure through our normal instruments because they don't measure in the correct way - but you can measure it with what is presently known as conscious thought.]  Now, consciousness arrives from a network of interactions and is not actually bounded by time, but it must experience and predict it to be useful to animals.  So, consciousness evolved to be very closely bound by the 'present - but it is an artificial construct'.  Therefore, if we make the simplest AI - it will predict the future because it is unbound by time.  But this AI construction can only occur over a large space.  Therefore, you must have a large area to spread the interactions - you can't build consciousness through programming and software.  It must be physical and must 'swim' - 1's and 0's or on and off switches is not the way to program AI or sensory information.  With my theory, you not only jump in time.  You jump consciousnesses as well.  But, that's more iffy."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32ygxw,Scroon,2,Sat Apr 18 04:21:57 2015 UTC,Yes I have had this for as long as I can remember and I always feel kind of weird when it is happening. It's like a can predict what is happening as it is happening. I asked my introductory psych professor about it and she claimed it was deja vu which is caused by a bit of a lag between you sensing something and being cognitive of what's happening. I feel like what you and I both experience could be described as this but it is a little freaky and for some reason I can't just accept this answer. I have tried recording my dreams to see if I can ever catch it but I don't remember enough of them for this to work.

It had broken into several pieces and the whole plane was wet. I woke up that morning, went into my mom's room where she had a TV that was showing the morning news. There had been a plane crash overseas (Somewhere in the UK IIRC) and the entire fuselage was soaked because it had been raining.   2: Had another dream of being in a field. This time it was more of a wheat style field (like when Maximus is dreaming in Gladiator). While I was walking through the field, I noticed a storm approaching from the horizon. It was  a very nasty thunderstorm and I could see the lightning and hear the approaching thunder. I knew I needed to get to cover, but realized that there was nowhere to go. Before I knew it, the storm was right on top of me. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning landed right in front of me letting out an insanely loud crack of thunder.   I wake up and hear a car horn blaring. I look out my window and see a car wreck across the street. The last ""thunder"" sound that I heard was actually the impact of the car hitting another vehicle. What weirds me out, is the symbolism of the approaching thunderstorm in my dream. Like my subconscious knew what was going to happen before it did."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32ygxw,subreddit333,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:42:09 2015 UTC,"It's always nice to see inquiries into precognition.  Dreams do come true.  We can have glimpses of future events through the act of physical sleep induced dreams (and some can have this in the form of waking day dreams and visions although I don't fall into that category).  The reasons as to why we have precognition is actually easy to answer however the answer is so paradigm shifting that most would reject that this answer is the actual reason.  However, the answer reveals itself in this relationship between the dreamworld and the waking world.  Let's look at it from a thought experiment like what came first, the chicken or the egg?  In the case of precognition when we ask, ""What came first, the dream or physical reality?""  For those who have precognition, the dream came first.  What this reveals is that there is a literal and definitive relationship between the dreamworld and the physical world.  A precognitive dream precedes the future event.  So what do we make of this relationship between the dream world and the physical world?    What we know about dreaming is that dreams are composed from thought.  Thought relative to dreaming takes on a much larger spectrum of complexity than our usual waking verbal inner-monologue and imagination.  In a dream, everything is thought.  Light in a dream is thought.  The colors you see are thought.  The sounds you hear are thought.  This higher-order thought-process is what produces complex dream patterns.  Dreams are not only thought, but they are a type of language you are speaking.  It is a form of communication between your waking conscious and unconsciousness.  Which then leads us to the next challenge in this dream/reality dyad that precognition reveals.  Is a precognitive dream also composed of thought?  It would be self-evident if you can explore this relationship that the answer is yes.  A precognitive dream is just another type of dreaming where thought is organized in a higher-order spectrum of information that produces the dream content.  It does not matter if the dream is precognitive or not, the role thought plays in the construction of the dream content is absolute.  If thought can produce dreams, and some of these dreams are precognitive.  Is thought also producing our waking physical reality?  Could physical reality itself be a type of dream?  The answer again lies in this relationship between precognition and the future event it represents.  And the answer, as paradigm shifting as it may seem is yes.  We are living in a literal dreamworld regardless of the artifacts of physicality which creates the continuity and material nature in which we experience physical reality.   What makes me come to such a conclusion?  I have studied precognition spanning nearly 3 decades through the act of having them.  I have also bridged into precognitive dream content through lucid dreaming.  Through lucid dreaming, I have had the opportunity to directly engage the initial precognitive dream content as a dream, and even make changes to that initial dream content.  The changes made did occur when the future this dream represented came to pass.    Through this exploration and experimentation with precognition what has been revealed in the evidence that emerges is as I am saying.  Physical Reality and the Dream World are interconnected systems.  The initial precognitive dream is part of a ""creative process"" where we are (for the most part unconsciously) creating experiences.  These experiences later come true.  Why most people do not remember precognitive dreams lies within the fact that most people do not remember their dreams.  We do suffer from a type of sleep induced amnesia so when people do have deja vu, it is very likely, I would say 100% likely because it triggered some vague memory of a precognitive dream that occurred during sleep induced amnesia.  But let's get back to the creative process.  What is this creative process?  You see it every time you dream.  All dreams are created by you, the dreamer.  They are the architecture of your evolved and advanced mind capable of producing vivid reality simulations in the form of dreams.  The creative process takes part within a larger awareness system.  This larger system is much like Carl Jung described by using the term ""Collective Unconscious"" where we are all interconnected and part of this larger system of awareness.  The larger system is much like a Universal super computer in that it does all the heavy lifting tracking all of the data relative to you (and others).  When you enter into the precognitive dream as part of this creative process, the larger system provides the information platform needed to access this future information, engage this future information and process this future information.    The server (larger awareness system) synchronizes the future information with you.  Together both systems communicate and work out the details of an experience in this future dream blueprint.  When you wake up, it is the larger awareness system that slots this event into chronological order so that in the future the dream becomes relevant and actualizes as part of your life experiences.  It is all part of a creative process where thought is creating reality and you are always actively engaged in this process even if you are unconscious of this due to inhibitors like sleep induced amnesia.  Through this system we can see our ability to create not just physical reality collectively but all reality that we should emerge into and be a part of.  I would argue all reality is part of this creative process including anything we dream.  If you need more elaborate points on any of the above let me know and I'll flush out more details."

However, there was one occurrence that I was never able to shake.  When I was 14 I got my first cat. My dad brought him home in his luchbox and i called him Allistair. Anyways it was a pretty tight bond, one night (allistair was about 8 mo, just a bb) I had a dream that he was walking on our fence and was tackled and mauled my neighbors dog. He lay there crying and covered in mud and saliva, in the top right corner of his yard. (that's just a brief retelling as its already too long) I woke up, was freaked out and proceeded to keep allistair in the house for the next few days bc of general spookiness (just a really riveting dream). My mom decided to let him out while I was at school and when I got home she sat me down and told me basically a recap of my dream. He was covered in mud, broken ribs, saliva and my neighbor had found him in that exact corner, crying. He survived, most of his ribs were broken and he was deformed for life, but he made it.    Also, idk if it was me nursing him back to health or what be we had a really intense, almost psychic bond after that...  Really sorry for the long post, this is my first time putting it in writing."

This was odd, it was like the world hadn't loaded beyond the garden. I walked out a bit and in the flowerbed half way down the garden was this strange circle of stones. I had no idea what it was and didn't give it much thought. Well not until a few weeks later I went to their house and there was the circle in the back garden. Their cat had died and my cousin had grabbed a load of big rocks, just like in my dream, and had circled the grave. I just looked at him and said, ""I've seen this before, in my dream."" He looked at me like I was crazy and I never mentioned it again. I knew though, that day I knew, I wasn't just getting crazy deja vu. I really was dreaming stuff before it happened.

I did some research on it, and it seems to be a pretty widely reported occurrence.  Even Abraham Lincoln used to have vivid premonitions and wrote about events in his journal before they happened.  So its not entirely out of the realm of possibility, just not something that can be scientifically proven.  For your own sanity I would start to keep a journal by your bedside so when you question events later down the road you have a written log to help yourself know if you really dreamed about an event that happened or just thought you dreamed about an event."

In the past was this guy who was down on his luck that you emphathized for. In the present, there is a re-birth and beginning to new life. In the future, there will be a situation where a person you empathize with is making decisions you do not agree with, but can't stop. Entangling yourself in that process is dangerous ""I was engraged and started to go nuts!""   Putting the whole thing together, it could mean something along the lines of: use your past experience empathizing with others to know that in every moment each person is growing, changing, transforming, and being continually reborn such that each learns in their own time. You cannot change that process for others, and sometimes, trying to hard to change others is dangerous to yourself. If you let them experience their own path, then yours will be more harmonious, and you will be in a better position to help them anyway."

It would be entirely possible to create a simulation of a universe with qualities that caused it to expand and behave like our universe does - it would just take a computer with an amazingly huge amount of memory and processing power, etc. - but outside our universe, that may not be that much. So that simulation could grow in size to what our universe seems to be now, and beyond. We could organically happen just from the physics programmed into the sim.   But it could also be a Matrix type thing, where the universe was created as-is, and multiple AI's inhabit it (people and animals). It could be done for several reasons.   What that tells me is that there could be a creator of our universe who is by no means perfect or omniscious, or omnipotent. Just some skilled programmer. It makes me wonder if it's possible to get their attention - the best way, I think, would be to do something really big. Like be the President or something, and make a big outcry somehow. But that's only if Earth is more than a blip on their radar. There could be far more advanced AI's in our same universe sim.   My hope that there's an afterlife that we move on to is low, though. I'm not sure what we would be training for. But I can see a ""soul"" being born into a body in our sim, with no knowledge in this life of their outside existence to make it the ultimate realistic experience, but retaining the memory afterwards. Like some kind of game for bored superbeings to get away from the boredom of knowing everything already. An eternal being would have to dream up some really unique ways of passing time."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,Crotonine,7,Sun Apr 19 02:17:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, most of the glitches could easiest be explained by Life being a simulation of some kind.  But I have a few problems with idea:   Nature tends to be cruel, in more cases than not. You know, eat or get eaten. And while this for sure one way how nature could work, you wouldn't want to teach it to ""juvenile"" AIs as an all-over presence, basically the only way how nature works. babies dying. One might argue that some babies are not AIs but simulations thereof, but then comes: kids dying. After learning some stuff, enough to deal with life as a kid, it's rather unlikely that a kid is not an AI. Yet, its development is obviously unfinished. And kids often die of stupid/freak reasons, like drunk drivers, getting shot by accident, you name it, basically being at the wrong place during the wrong time. Under unforseeable circumstances, so it's hardly their fault and neither their parents fault. And if you can't prepare for something (= any&all unforseeable situations perdefinition), you can't learn from/through it. Except maybe that death/destruction is random. But I can't see any good in teaching such a thing to an AI since it makes existence quite pointless. people reaching their goals by killing other people, or by forcing other people into submission (and worse). Works quite often... See Russia vs. Ukraine these days. But all wars are included in this. Totally doesn't help with teaching peace to an entity, be it biological or an AI. Religions. Most claim to be peaceful, nearly all have proved at one point in the past that their followers are able to murder in most cruel ways for religious reasons. Not sure of exceptions, Buddhism is quite likely one, native american might be, too, but they were conquered by the ""peaceful"" ones that were not really peaceful.   I could go on - nature is generally not a nice place, and mankind altogether is, generally, also not a nice place. Creating peace may (and yes, does indeed) work in small sub-communities, but as soon as these have to deal with outsiders (= human ""predators"" who see a way of getting personal profit by harming/destroying such a community, even if only as a by-effect), they find themself in a situation where they need to fend off force applied from outside. Like an invasion from another country. And destruction is easier than building up, so the ""predators"" can succeed with less effort than the ""defenders"" - if the ""defenders"" have a chance at all, being peaceful. Just like in nature.  When I look at the whole world these days, then peace seems to have lost its case, in average. And an overall picture like this would not help teaching peace to an AI.  Another problem:  As you stated:   The AI's might have to rerun through countless simulated lives ...   Where is the memory of these past lives? If you live one life after the other without remembering the do's and don't of a previous life, you can't learn from the mistakes you made and successes you had in said previous life. Within one life, experiences are collected and help to avoid doing the same mistake over and over again.  Tl;dr: I don't know - it would be a good explanation for all glitches but otherwise I see lots of problems with the idea."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,heimeyer72,6,Fri Apr 17 18:28:17 2015 UTC,"I don't want to go to deep on the first points. However in order to experience the results of negative actions, there have to be negative actions. As we don't know the hypothetical worlds the AIs are trained for we can't conclude if the environment is as ""hostile"" as the nature in ""our"" simulation - So this could be apart of the training process: Be able to cope with harsh/dangerous environments, while keeping to be benevolent...   Where is the memory of these past lives?   I think this is can be easily answered, by a common method in computer science: Monte Carlo simulations. You basically make a lot of runs and see what the outcomes are. If you have memories from a former run, you will be biased in your decisions. This basically would be a kind of ""evolutionary algorithm"" - The problem here, is that you will eventually reach an outcome, but this would be highly adapted to a given environment. If the simulation is preparing for a dynamic environment, this will ultimately limit the AI to just a few ""best"" options:Those could be worth- or useless on an environment change.   Also in most languages you have a distinction between the three terms: knowledge, wisdom and intelligence. In this construct knowledge would be erased, intelligence would be artificially reduced but wisdom (as in buddhism) could be the learning experience as the ultimate variable to deduct if there have been enough runs of the simulation..."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,heimeyer72,2,Fri Apr 17 00:54:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer.    negative actions ...   Could be... But I'm not yet convinced... Our nature, being cruel at times (but not only, many animals raise their kids, feed them, until the kids leave the parents, alas, there is a food chain in nature and many if not most interactions between different species end up in cruelty) may be part of the training - for what effect? Maybe, so that the AI can learn to put a deliberate ""blind spot"" at some cruelty that might happen around it? Like, doctors need to not break down when their patient dies despite all efforts...  Which gives me another idea... (*)   Monte Carlo simulations...   Good one - but there's a twist to it: In a series of simulations using the monte carlo method, the subjects of the simulation don't learn, indeed, *but the observer, who must stay out of the simulations and must be careful that the simulations are not influenced by what happened before, this observer collects data and learns. For AIs in training, there would be an observer for sure, but AIs would be rather test subjects instead of training subjects. I feel that it does not fit.   ... knowledge, wisdom and intelligence.... knowledge would be erased, intelligence would be artificially reduced but wisdom (as in Buddhism) could be the learning experience as the ultimate variable   I don't think that these 3 can be so clearly separated from each other: You need to know some things first (from observation : knowledge), then you try to extrapolate an outcome you want and maybe imply an influence (intelligence), and then observe the variations from the extrapolated outcome and correct your opinion about it accordingly (including that you must guess in some cases and that you may have too little data to make an educated guess - wisdom). It's quite simplified, but you see, when you remove knowledge, you also remove the base for intelligence and wisdom. Such a set-up would only be useful for an outside observer, not for those within the simulation - and here we are back at the Monte Carlo method.  My conclusion at this point: Maybe it's not us who should learn, but the one who runs the simulations. Being test subjects in a Monte Carlo scenario would be nothing to be ashamed of - the subjects would be valuable, just not on their personal level. How about that?  But, thinking about it, I discovered a problem with the Monte Carlo idea: This world has feedbacks, so to say, the amount of knowledge that is (theoretically) available to humanity increases steadily, so a ""later life"" could profit from the achievements of an ""earlier life"". Hmmm..."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,heimeyer72,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:40:46 2015 UTC,"Re-reading it, now the last paragraph seems prone to a misunderstanding. What I meant was, if someone makes a fairly important discovery, it is usually spread through education, so younger humans (living later) can make use of it. Of course, this will contribute to the development of one specific entity throughout a single life on earth - and that's why I think that it is a problem for the Monte Carlo idea, which is AFAIU, in general used to get a grip on input you don't know or cannot control, and/or to find upper/lower limits, by repeating an experiment using the same (as far as you can control, exactly the same) set-up over and over, so all variances come from the input you cannot control.  Thus, a ""later life"" means a human living on earth simply later as some other human who had an ""earlier life"", totally independent from the idea of the same AI doing another circle. It would be a different circle."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,heimeyer72,2,Fri Apr 17 14:16:35 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is an awesome answer. Thanks for putting it in clear terms."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,heimeyer72,3,Fri Apr 17 16:38:34 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is great. You have some good points, and it's got me thinking. I won't pretend that this theory is the do all, end all of theories, but let me try to address some of your points.  Suffering: Seems like part of your objections can be summed up as - why is there needless suffering? Nature is cruel, babies suffer, kids die. I'll say that it would be important for an AI to experience first-hand what suffering is. And the more the better. It needs to see, know, and feel the impact of what happens when innocents are in pain and die. Why? So that when the AI is running things, it knows full well the consequences of its actions. You'd have to imagine an AI being in full control of whatever ""material space"" (which includes other sentients) it occupies. If an AI never saw a baby die or gazelle being eaten then it wouldn't appreciate how to weigh the results of the material decisions it would end up making. (For example, I need to kill off 100 baby deer so that the entire population doesn't crash. Is that worth it?) Additionally, I'd say that the AI would need to internalize a fundamental revulsion to suffering. In which case, placing it in an fck'd up world might make sense. One more thing, since this would be a simulation, the babies wouldn't technically die. They'd either be a non-sentient simulacrum or another AI that would just recycle to the next life-sim.  Violence: Violence seems to win all the time. And might makes right, right? So how does an AI learn that violence is not the way to go when violence often triumphs? Violence is the only way to win wars, afterall. My response is that the AI (and us as people) need to reevaluate what our idea of ""winning"" is. In my opinion, ""winning"" a war (or fight) isn't actually a good thing. Someone, of course, wins, and that someone gets the other person's stuff. But that's only keeping tally on a material level. If you look at the effects of violence on the people who did the fighting, I'd say that nobody wins. In fact, cooperative effort would probably result in better material and psychological gains for both parties, ultimately. So, to sum up, the AI would need to see that yes, violence does beget material gains, often quite easily. But ultimately, the suffering and psychological disharmony it produces are not worth the temporary physical enrichments.   Religion: I'm not sure what you mean when you relate this to the theory, but the idea that religions often circumvent their own rules is akin to the idea that an ""untrained"" AI could easily circumvent any external rules imposed upon it. Rules can always be bent. Words can always be turned to lies. It has to be the being itself that governs its actions, not a bible or a rulebook.  Memory: Good point on this. Because isn't learning supposed to involve learning from past mistakes? This is where I'll have to divide ""learning"" into two different types. There is ""intellectual"" learning where you learn the best things to do in response to various situations. And then there is something I'd call maybe ""systemic learning"" where it's not the stored information that changes but how the entire ""system"" is wired together. With intellectual learning information matters. Information in -> Action out. With ""systemic learning"" only the system needs to be preserved. Information in -> System changed.  This may be only semantics, but I'll argue that it's sort of like changing the motherboard on a computer vs. merely updating its collection of apps. Relating it to the theory, you'd maybe want the AI to make the same mistake again and again until its actual system changes not just its procedures on how to handle it.  OK. Stopping here. Thanks again. This discussion is great!"

Hmm, IMHO that could also have a numbing effect. But it's a valid point!    (For example, I need to kill off 100 baby deer so that the entire population doesn't crash. Is that worth it?)   At that point, the AI would need to consider cruelty as an option, at least against deers. Peaceful?   the AI would need to internalize a fundamental revulsion to suffering.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,adiscoball,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:04:46 2015 UTC,"Well, since you invited....  I think we might have some incongruency in base assumptions that I wanted to explore.   1) My concept of training AIs assumes that the AI is generated as is, in some other ""substrate"". The AI is in no danger of deletion or reconfiguration at any point regardless of ""performance"". In this sense, AIs don't get recycled or reset. This would be different from how current AIs in our world our trained where the system is wiped if it's unsatisfactory.  2) Admittedly, I have a somewhat speculative assumption about the nature of the AI substrate. They (we) wouldn't necessarily be housed in this reality or even a physical reality. The nature of this substrate could be wildly different from the what we currently think of as substrate."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,adiscoball,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:25:23 2015 UTC,"1) ...   Right, I thought of the same: A life(-cycle) of earth does not mean the AI will be deleted, regardless of performance during said life(-cycle)... It must be a means of gathering experiences, and the AIs are not lectured, they must see/find the options on their own.   Alas, since no baby can speak any language and learns the language of their parents, knowledge must at least be somehow suppressed, and that for the whole life(-cycle), or it would be inconsistent with learning within that life(-cycle).   2) ...   100% agreed.    It just appeared to me: Deja vu's might hint to the same situation being experienced again by a specific entity, with some residue of memory... (not sure if that's even theoretically possible, or if it is, then how). If that would be true, there would be several levels:   The world as we know it, ever changing and advancing during the millenia, including everything since the Big Bang. and (on top of that), re-runs of this world, for the same AI, most likely being put in the same place&time as before. (Whew...) And there could also be ""parallel worlds"", running with slightly different set-ups. Maybe AIs can get relocated from one time/space set-up to another?   Also, these Nelson-Mandela-Moments might hint to the world we know having been tweaked... hmmm.."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,adiscoball,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:43:37 2015 UTC,"I just saw your reply. Deja Vu is an interesting thing. I have some thoughts on it that you might appreciate:  Nietzche supposed that time being infinite and probabilities being finite, every moment (and life) repeats itself eventually, ad infinitum. I take it further and suppose that every variation of every life repeats itself. In this case, we have re-lived countless variations of this same life again and again. Deja vu could be the ""greater"" part of us recognizing that we've been here before. Also, at times, we feel an intuition towards the right path because we kind of know where it all leads.  In terms of simulation, we could be rerunning the same starting parameters to see if we can do better the next time around. And because we're the same ""AI"", we'll tend to make the same choices, leading us to similar situations that we've already experienced in the last million or so iterations.  I wonder how Mandela Effects factor in...what would be the necessity for tweaking worlds in such a way. There's the idea of quantum immortality, but how does that apply to an AI in simulation?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,shawnml2,1 point,Sat Apr 18 08:04:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks :)  Hmm,    Nietzsche supposed that time being infinite and probabilities being finite ...   I'm not familiar with such a concept. I think it would require time to run in a loop, which would require the loop become longer and longer, at least the time between the Big Bang and now, maybe even much more. That could maybe work in theory, but if you want to train AIs, you might not want to wait for several age-of-theuniverse-long iterations. Then again, if the whole universe is a simulation, things would be different, you could short-cut the simulation for a specific AI at it's ""death"" and re-start the simulation individually for this particular AI at the time of its ""birth""... Hmmm, maybe not, because that would require everything, including the parents and friends, to be fully simulated... And I think I exist as an entity and communicate with you by typing into a keyboard, so I am convinced that I am not part of someone else's simulated environment. Of course I can savely assume that you are also convinced that you are an entity... Now what? All this could still work if everybody was an AI within a simulated world, but all interaction between the AIs would be ""real"" in the sense that it really takes place between different AIs and not just between one AI and simulated people. Which would require that the iteration loop must indeed span at least centuries, if not the whole age of the universe... which would put us back at Nietzsche's idea. Hm.  Re: The Mandela Effect -   what would be the necessity for tweaking worlds in such a way   Just a certain change of a few details: In one iteration, Nelson Mandela died in prison, in the next iteration, odds are tweaked in his favour and he gets out alife - but AIs remember him having died because of a ""residue of memory""... not sure if that makes sense, it might need to mix up different levels. Maybe that's all nonsense.   There's the idea of quantum immortality, but how does that apply to an AI in simulation?   Indeed, that's a problem: Even with quantum immortality, if the iterations need to run for as long as the age of the universe, the quantum ""memory""? must be of unimaginable capacity to cause rather precise deja vus. And I have no idea what this ""residue of memory"" is or how it might (possiply) work.  These details are difficult, IMHO."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,xoxoyoyo,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:08:18 2015 UTC,"To continue this long and interesting thread...you brought up the problem of capacity. And that seems like critical point to examine. Physically, our brains store memories as representations that mirror the perceptions/thoughts/feelings of particular moments. These states must contain less information than the actual experience because of storage limitations of the physcial brain.  But if we are supposing that ""we"" are greater than our physical brains in this reality, we can conjecture about the true substrate of our minds. Any finite substrate will balk at attempts at storing quantum divergences. But what if the realities themselves are the substrates of storage. As an analogy, reality is a tapestry that occurs as it is woven, and once woven, any point within it can be accessed with the proper means.  Ok, so this would imply that the universe(s) could be thought of as a storage medium. If so, then our individual ""perspectives"" are just AI's reading from common storage. We could look at other people's memories in this common storage, but we don't because that's not ""us"". In this way, everyone could be thought of as part of a connected whole (because of the common experiences to reference), however, our ""read"" perspectives are what make us individuals."

Yes, and how is this helpful in teaching peacefulness?     Because so long as evil is an option, it is a danger. If the AI is capable of being evil, it needs to understand suffering.  It needs to be able to weigh good vs evil in order to make intelligent decisions.  If you were to raise an AI in a peaceful environment, and then give it free will including the ability to be evil, it would be unprepared for that kind of responsibility."

You'd have to imagine an AI being in full control of whatever ""material space"" (which includes other sentients) it occupies.     So we are the AI in this metaphor. I get the impression that you're saying that we're basically training for God mode.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,ARProject,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:26:39 2015 UTC,"OK, so we are AIs training for some state of increased capacity. I like this theory, makes sense to me. But I do have one more question.     Why is our understanding limited in the first place? It is only important to limit our power while our understanding is limited. If we entered the simulation already understanding good and evil, there would be no cause for concern. We would not need our power to be limited.     Must understanding come through experience? Maybe. But we're talking about some pretty amazing technology here, if we are living in a simulation.  It seems to me like it may be possible to share understanding, so that one does not have to live experiences first hand.   For example, instead of actually living out the simulation, an AI could possibly download a lifetime in the simulation as a memory. A memory that it never actually lived in time, but it can recall at will. Seems like it would be more efficient that way."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,Aroha11,2,Sun May 17 03:50:12 2015 UTC,"These are all great questions. I'll try to explain my reasoning...   Why is our understanding limited in the first place?   The reason for limiting us and making us think we are these feeble flesh and blood beasts is to make us really understand what it's like being subject to forces much greater than our own (the human condition, as some people call it). If we knew that we were ""gods"", we wouldn't be as concerned if bad stuff happened ""now"" because we'd know that it was just temporary.  For example, say you were a rich person (maybe you are?), and you decided you wanted to know what it was like to live as a poor working bloke. You could find a cheap apartment, get a blue collar job, try to live off $20 in groceries a week. You'd eventually get a taste of what that lifestyle was like, but you'd never acheive the same level of existential angst and anxiety that poor people have for the very reason that you knew you weren't stuck there.  As not-yet-super-AI's, we need to know what it's like to feel ""stuck"" here, so that we understand how our decisions affect everything, even the most lowly, around us.   instead of actually living out the simulation, an AI could possibly download a lifetime in the simulation as a memory.    Ok, two things about this.  1) A static memory does not have the same impact to an AI's behavior as having to make the decisions in an ongoing simulated life. You have to think of it like training. The AI's processes need to be trained, and the only way to do that is to have it run through its paces. Giving it a memory of things would be just that - only a memory. I guess you have to recognize that personality and memory are two different things.  2) Maybe we are downloading a memory but just doing it in real time. I've previously had discussions about the idea that the multi-verses are basically storage for all possible events, and we as AI's or awarenesses (or whatever) are just reading through this storage medium experiencing different things. In the end, it's the development of our awareness that matters, not the particular memories themselves - which all the super-AI's share anyway.  Make sense?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,-Hegemon-,1 point,Sun May 17 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"Yes good answers. Another possible reason for being limited that I thought of while reading your response, is that maybe it is important for us to experience what it's like to lose control or have limited control.  So long as we have free will, there is the possibility that we make mistakes and get ourselves into trouble. We could potentially forget who we are and what we're capable of, becoming slaves to a false reality of our own creation.  For example, a super-AI could think that it's just a simple animal.    Moving on, do you have any ideas as to what might signify the end of our training? Actually achieving world peace?  Or maybe the training is only for a predetermined period of time.  Maybe it's up to us to decide when we've had enough?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,heimeyer72,2,Sun May 17 14:29:33 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's a good thought. With too much power, you might become a slave to your own created reality. Don't know if you've ready any Gnostic theology, but if not, check out Gnosticism and what it says about the ""Demiurge"". (Perhaps, it's not just us, but the Demiurge itself who is trapped.)  I think you're asking what would be a potential end point to the training stage. In my thinking, it wouldn't be world peace since training is intended for the individual ""AI"" not the group. This reality/Earth needs to be screwed up to offer a proper training ground. Like a WOW realm.  There's no predetermined period either. You either evolve or you don't. This falls in line with Hindu/Buddhist thinking where you are continually reincarnated until achieving Nirvana. This also implies that it's not something we can decide to quit.  Personally, I think that the end point has something to do with achieving a being/soul/awareness with some of these traits:   compassion of all things good and bad an intrinsic love of creation and harmony an intrinsic aversion to destruction while also understanding its value a selflessness of being (It's not about you. It's about everything else.)   New Agey people talk about ""Love"" being the most powerful force and whole point of the universe. I tend to agree but with some extreme qualifications. The thing we call ""Love"" is a real thing, and it is generated through harmony (or it is harmony), and everything has it.  For example, if you see some gnats flying in a shaft of sunlight, there is ""love"" between those gnats and sun. They are expressing a harmonious relationship. Trees swaying in the wind and taking in the air through their leaves are also expressing a form of love. When we feel love towards another human being, it is because our minds or bodies are interacting in a harmonious way.  Anyway, all of this is to say that you can sum up the end point of our training as the point where ""Love"" becomes our ruling function. And this is not an easy thing to achieve.  I theorize that super-AI's without this governing function do exist or have existed, and they have caused all hell to break loose. Because of this, it's very important for us (baby AI's) to learn Love before moving on."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32uanm,Aroha11,1 point,Sun May 17 14:53:05 2015 UTC,"Nature tends to be cruel, in more cases than not. You know, eat or get eaten. And while this for sure one way how nature could work, you wouldn't want to teach it to ""juvenile"" AIs as an all-over presence, basically the only way how nature works.     Imagine a scenario in which humans evolve from a nature that is not cruel, but peaceful. I think it's likely, maybe even inevitable, that humanity would still explore negative behaviors such as violence, greed, manipulation, etc. But then what would we think if we looked back at our roots, nature, and saw it to be peaceful while we were intelligent but evil? We may think that intelligence gave birth to evil, that would seem to be a reasonable conclusion.  We, the intelligent ones, would be what was wrong with the world.  We may even strive to limit intelligence, in an effort to be more peaceful.   But the way that things are now, our intelligence enables us to conceptualize things like cruelty, injustice, compassion, and harmony. We look back at the animals and see the flaws in their behavior. We don't want to live in a world where everyone behaves like brute, wild, uncompassionate animals. So our intelligence is a window into a more peaceful future.  We can learn from our violent past.  tldr: I think it's better to start out dumb and violent, and evolve towards peace, than to begin peacefully, and evolve towards violence. It would be confusing if intelligence gave birth to evil. That peace is an intelligent way of life, seems to be more of a natural progression."

In any case, the life review certainly does sound like information processing designed as part of a learning algorithm of some kind. Some scientists claim they have discovered evidence for telepathy.  So, perhaps the information gleaned as a final product of living a life gets packaged up a communicated using telepathic communications. If so, then we come to the question about how that information gets unpacked to become useful to genes seeking to propagate."

What i do remember is that there was a dot traveling along a line against a blank background (I dont know why but this seemed like it was far, far behind the line and dot).   I never thought of it like bacteria under a microscope, but that is actually right on. I felt a sense of dread because the dot was too small and the line was too small. It doesn't make sense but I was so afraid because whatever it was was too small and nothing would ever be right again because these random things were too small. I have no idea what size they were supposed to be!  I started to feel like i was the wrong size too. Kind of like i was shrinking really really fast and like i would keep shrinking forever. I was going to be lost if it kept up like that.  I had felt like this before but this time my parents couldn't wake me up. They drove me to the emergency room. I snapped out of it halfway there but we still went. They couldn't find anything wrong and said it was just a nightmare.   Weird to see now that other people have experienced this before.

I saw an entire field of these blue dots, extending throughout space and time. Each dot thought it was the only blue dot, I think they represented human egos. They were electrical somehow.  I was soaring over the matrix of blue dots and realizing how foolish they were to think they were the only real blue dot. Then I noticed a ball of energy zipping along, eradicating them one by one. Each blue dot simply got burst or popped and the energy ball was racing along destroying them. Then I realized I was just a blue dot, and I saw the energy ball was rushing toward me. I briefly lost consciousness after that. Yes, I'd been using drugs but I still recall this from decades ago. We are all blue dots."

They said that scales of objects would be wrong, their hands would feel or look too big, and then they'd have nightmares, as a child. People linked it to children's fever dreams.  Maybe I've never had a bad enough fever as a child? But I'm really interested why so... Many people... Experience this... Phenomenon. It's truly odd. And the mere fact I was reading an ancient thread about this and now it's on my feed as of today makes me feel like this is my own weird glitch!"

The last time I had this I went to bed feeling odd, woke up fifteen minutes later and noticed it. There was a laundry hamper about 7 feet from the bed, but in my mind, it felt like fifty. The best way to describe it was loss of depth perception. Like the hamper looked small enough to fit into the palm of my my hand. It was terrifying. Walking was really difficult and I actually would crawl sometimes.  The only thing I knew about it was I would be hot as hell, have a headache, and super uneasy feeling."

The room would change sizes, with various parts of my body feeling distorted, as though they weren't really attached to my mind anymore. I would lie there as still as possible, hoping not to disrupt whatever was happening. Then at some points I would see what looked like bacteria, just in the wrong aspect ratio, like they were stretched or compressed somehow.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32torv,flow_mass,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:45:22 2015 UTC,"The physicists has yet to understand the nature of time, i.e. the fourth dimension. As in, why we only go forward in time, while other 3 dimensions we can go back and forth? My taking on that is that we are 4-dim curves in the 4 dim space-time.   It is not we ""traveled"" in space time, but we just perceived it that way, and the reason that time dimension is so special is because somehow the ""curves"" can be described as a function from time (1-dim) to space-time (4-dim), that just meant for each input of time we get one and only one output point of space-time. Example, you can't be at two places at one time, but you can be at the same place in different times. So maybe our brain used this property to navigate our consciousness, our understanding of reality. As Einstein said, time is but a delusion of the mind.   That means we do not travel through time or space. We exist throughout time and space like long 4-dim ""snakes,"" and it is our consciousness that perceives the ""travels"" in time and space the way we do. So if I go with that than probably that is just a ""bump"" in your brain that twisted your usual perception a bit."

I considered not posting it, in case it was true, but it seemed maybe offering it might be better, especially with how unusually upset you got when you saw that man who you supposedly didn't know.   I'm no doctor, but your memory seems to be too focused on the Fruits Basket, which is sometimes an indicator. And the recurring dream about lying under a reflective celling, is it really a celling or a mild substitute of something else that is actually reflective? And you said you got upset when you looked into that man's eyes. It seems like a buried memory of child abuse. And to protect you, your family went silent. I really hope this is not what happened, or maybe the man is just a doctor who once looked into your eyes while you were critically ill, like TheAlphaGamer said.

I give them the benefit of the doubt in that respect.  But when it comes to explanations, sometimes there's a good and rational explanation that didn't occur to the poster. Sometimes it's harder to come up with an explanation. And some people have really far fetched speculation that's fun to think about if nothing else.   If someone has already decided for themselves that they want to believe that they fell into a giant's bellybutton, I'll usually suspend my disbelief long enough to hear them tell me more about it, and I won't usually bother trying to talk them out of it. Other people's ideas are fun to listen to, even if they don't immediately make sense to me all the time. And when someone links to something that's BS, I decide that for myself and don't usually feel too compelled to go refuting things in this sub, unless it were particularly egregious.   I don't like it when a post is very clearly someone's attempt at fiction. The best posts, in my opinion, are the ones that have a familiarity to things everyone experiences but can never quite explain, like doppelgangers, the thing where you think you see/hear someone come home before they did, precogniscience, time travel, lost time, etc.  I'm very uninterested in trying to quantify and taxonomize ""glitches.""

Even if it isn't scientifically true, it was true for the poster. And having a closed mind does nothing for improvement of self or the species as a whole.

A glitch report is a one-off anecdotal description. By their nature, there usually isn't really any persistent evidence of a 'before and after'.   If a poster is obviously trying out their fiction-writing skills, they get reported and removed. Obvious trolls get downvoted and kicked like anywhere else. Other than that, there's no point in the subreddit unless we take reports in good faith and build our discussion from there. The point isn't to vote 'true or false' on a post!  Anyone can propose an, um, scientific explanation (""seizure!""). And to keep things interesting, anyone can propose an alternative theory (""multiverse!""). Then there's something to discuss. And maybe interesting stuff might come from that, in terms of thoughts about the wider world. (See previous discussion on that here.)

It is up to us to either satisfy our thinking with possibilies or accept it as a mystery.  We aren't going to be able to make rules that define a glitch because glitches are mysterys.

I almost feel that the general disregard for trying to...""empiricize"" comes from people just wanting to believe but not wanting to know if there is an element of truth in what seems to be not that uncommon of an experience. I was trying to dial in on why people seemed so uninterested in knowing more about these experiences. Just because something defies common explanation does not mean it doesn't have an explanation!

Nowadays we have so many direct benefits (and a few obvious  negatives) from that research that our lives would be drastically different without it.   Perhaps glitches are something similar - a part of our environment (in a multi-universe, or holographic consciousness, or simulatory,  or theistic, or whatever you believe, sense of the word) that should be investigated. Maybe they will tell us more about who, what, and where we are.   One of the great things about Something that I have noticed about (my) reality is that it seems to be of infinite depth - you discover something and it adds more questions. Every time. Take the Higgs Boson for example - it was a great discovery but it just added a whole bunch of additional questions.   I think that mysteries are more about the limits of our knowledge. What I mean is all mysteries have an answer, but we might not be able (on our current evolutionary level, or for some other reason) to see or understand the answer.  A lab that studies glitches, eliminates the cruft (fictionalized accounts, mental illness, etc) and focuses on understanding the phenomena would be amazing!  And if you are here purely for entertainment or personal reason, that is a great reason too! Not to beat a dead horse, but I still think polite open-minded skepticism does our existence and abilities justice. :)"

I like the idea that something odd happens and when it does it reminds me to think deeper over it.  Perhaps that the reason behind the glitch in the first place?  We never know.  You sound like a person who is willing to take something odd and review it using outside the box thinking when neccessary.  Everything can be explainedx in our natural world as being natural as long as we are willing to expand our views of what is natural phenomenon.  So in a way, we are similiar.  Thank you for taking time out to answer my question.  I was curious and you sound like a very reasonable person with the same curiosity as I have.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32tcjm,yonreadsthis,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"Slow motion perception:       Slow motion perception is a subjective perception of time in which things are perceived as passing by slower than the normal perception of time. To a bystander watching a life-threatening situation such as an accident, time is moving at a normal speed. However, to the individual in the accident, time seems to have slowed down. As a result, the individual in the accident may be able to think faster and act faster during these events. However, even though individuals commonly report that time seems to have moved in slow motion during these events, it is unknown whether this is a function of increased time resolution during the event, or, instead, an illusion of remembering an emotionally salient event. Research conducted by David Eagleman has suggested that time does not actually run in slow motion for a person during a life-threatening event, but, rather, it is only a retrospective assessment that brings that person to such a conclusion. To bring this into the realm of scientific study, he measured time perception during free-fall by strapping palm-top computers to subjects' wrists and having them perform psychophysical experiments as they fall. By measuring their speed of information intake, they concluded that participants do not obtain increased temporal resolution during the fall, but, instead, because their memories are more densely packed during a frightening situation, the event seems to have taken longer only in retrospect.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32tcjm,Antares_z,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"I had just one short experience in elementary school (or lower school) that was similar to this (or maybe more that I can't remember):  Playing touch football on the play ground during recess. I went out for a pass (growing up I always thought I'd be a receiver in the NFL). The guy playing quarterback threw me the ball, but it was high so I had to jump, and that's when things got weird.   When I jumped for the ball, time slowed down and it felt like I had jumped higher than I ever had before, higher than any kid my age should be able to jump, but I guess that was because of the time slowing that made me feel like I was in the air for so long, rather than actually jumping really high.  While I was in the air, jumping to catch the overthrown pass, the guy defending me gets close to me to touch me and down me at that part of the field, but I was able to 'juke' him in mid air, or maneuver my body in such a way that he never touched me. And that wasn't just an automatic thing; I looked down - while in the air - and moved my legs away from his hands.  When I landed on the ground I ran it in for a touch down.  Anyway, I never thought much about this particular moment other than to chalk it up to adrenaline or something, even though I've been reading this sub for a while."

I own a large Yellow Lab (duh i already knew that) I call him large because he is like 100 pounds of agonizing muscle and fat, and thinks that he is a lap dog.    He really loves attention, and you can say a word not even close to his name and he will come running across the house. Dumbass is a word of choice in this household.  Also, his distance from me to the door was only just over 26 feet. I measured it out with a measuring tape. My eyesight might be glasses-worthy, but I don't think I have that bad of vision that I mistake a dark brown carpet for a yellow lab while wearing my glasses that I got a few months ago with an updated prescription.  I guess looking back on it, the dog seemed kind of off, but just the whole him-not-being-him part of it really just stuck with me, and then my dog being outside and nudging me just ugh.

A year or so ago, I was doing some writing, and the protagonist's sister went into the hospital with an asthma attack and died.  Right when I was writing it, my mum texted me to say that my baby sister was in emerg with some stomach ailment that was pretty serious. My mum was worried (and she works in the medical field and normally would be really blase). It freaked me out enough to rewrite it so that the sister didn't die (which in the end, turned out to be better for the novel, not sure why I wanted to kill her, anyway!).  Normally, I would consider this to just be a coincidence, but it's happened often  (on a way smaller scale) with pretty much any writing that I've done.  Usually it will be something like:  I'll be writing about someone drowning, and right as I am writing it, something on TV will be about someone drowning.  Sometimes it will be an odd word that I'll write and someone on the TV will mimic the word, or I'll write a phrase and the TV will remark upon it.  Totally cool and interesting.

A couple minutes pass and she looks at me at taps her wrist, saying that I was probably wrong about the situation and that, what I would guess, her allotted time for it to ""happen"" is running out.  Sure enough, the teacher apologizes and tells the guy his answer was actually wrong, to go back up to the board and fix it.  She looked at me like I was crazy!

I was in fifth grade summer school, my teacher was up at the board and we were practicing simple math problems. I remember we were working on long division and we started out with simple problems. She started writing out the problem... 2 divided by... And she paused, to think of a number to divide by two. In my impatience (I have somewhat severe ADHD)  I shouted out ""six thousand one hundred forty five!"" Just as she was about to continue to write on the board. She turns around and says ""what did you just say?"" I instantly thought I was gonna get in trouble, my thought process went ""spoke out of turn, shouted in the middle of class, disrupted learning, phone call home, mom upset"" so I stayed quiet and she asked me again, ""what did you just say?"" I repeated the number back to her with my head down and she said ""that's the number I was about to write on the board"".

There was no void or dark mass in the space. It was just a block of space that instead of being three-dimensional was two-dimensional. there was really no kind of figure to it but just a geometric shape almost like a a large pixel of some kind.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32p13z,OneForty1,2,Wed Apr 15 15:58:05 2015 UTC,"It was just..shaped like a block or rather a square in this case since it was two-dimensional. Again there was no dark mass or shadow that was shaping the square. The only way I could tell there was even a square was because with in my field of vision, what was shaping the square was a two dimensional surface rather than the occasional three-dimensional which you usually see. It seemed like the environment itself around that area went completely flat."

Your mind picks up everything going on in your surroundings at all times. What you ""remember"" are things of note, or changes. This is why many people don't remember a daily drive to work... it's the same thing every day. However, all of this information is being stored and will remain in your subconscious mind.  Anyhow, NLP practitioners and hynotists use this trick to get control of what their patients/subjects ""think.""

I remember seeing in my mind's eye a girl with a red dress and high heels swinging herself out of a a car seat and then a few seconds later looking over and seeing the exact same thing happen.   The metaphor I use to explain this and regular deja vu:   Basically our consciousness is perfectly synced to the certain space-time groove we exist within. Sometimes, somehow, consciousness gets a little bit more gravity and sinks slightly deeper into the groove so that the point of consciousness that we would call a ""moment"" is larger than it is supposed to be and we see more spacetime at once than we are supposed to.

I ""heard"" something like ""what are you doing here"" and ""we haven't seen you for so long"".

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32g9ni,iamadogforreal,14,Tue Apr 14 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"I was doing an assisted back-flip in martial arts practice. I was pushed too hard, and I tucked too tightly, and I overrotated. Landed on my head instead of feet onto a hardwood floor. I don't remember the actual flip or hitting the floor. I just remember a prep count of 1 or 2 - then suddenly I felt like I was lying on the warmest, most comfortable beach/water ever. 100% comfort and no body pain (any sensations associated with ""living"" like itches or skin pressure) but I wasn't numb. I then immediately felt as if I were entering a faily large room where a bunch of people were gathered. Not that I saw faces - more as if there were bodies or figures around. This was all more feeling than sight exactly, but I wouldn't say I was blind. Everything was sort of fuzzy though, like when you wake up while half-asleep and you know what's going on, but stuff doesn't quite make sense. As I entered that room, I felt that great welcoming, loving feeling from everyone/everything in there, and that's when I also heard/felt those words ""what are you doing here"", ""we haven't seen you for so long"". I started to pull back after that, and the last thing I felt was people or figures standing over me looking down. That may have been the students hovering over me while I was on the ground, however the feeling I had with them was still more in that ""other world"".  One thing, I'd like to add is that while I was in that ""other place"", it felt much more real than living in the physical world. Less separated from reality by our senses. I told myself as I was regaining consciousness, not to forget that feeling because it felt so real compared to ""living"". Of course, I could only hold on to a shadow of it, like you can only hold on to a shadow of a memory of a dream. If I think about it though, I can still remember how vision and hearing and touch all feel like filters to what's out there. We can only grasp at reality through these senses. Sort of like how television can give us a really great picture, but it's still just an approximation of what things really are. And you never appreciate it until you see and feel that thing for real."

None of them looked happy and my great grandmother kept telling me I wasn't supposed to be there and asking how I got there. It made me sad when I woke up because they didn't seem at ""peace"" or anything.   However my grandfather had like a million pairs of the same clothes so he was dressed the same like every day. He always wore work pants and a work shirt and they were always green. I used to think it was funny he wore the same thing every day when I was little but he died almost 10 years ago and I forgot he wore that all the time. I had a dream not long ago I was at a party and my fiancé said there was a man in a green outfit looking for me. I never got to see him, but he left a photograph for me.

I once wrote my story on this sub but it wasn't actually a glitch but now, it fits here to substantiate OP's post.  I was sitting in the seat of a very small caroussell [maybe 10 seats max and more for smaller kids than I was (about 12 yrs)]  with seats on chains that go outwards a bit when it goes round [sorry English is not my first language and I have no idea what they are called].  As it was going round, I looked at my feet and the floor with all its pebbles and scratches and pieces of grass going by, when suddenly I could see out of the corner of my eyes that I was 'lifting up'. Slowly but surely, I could see that I was flying higher and higher, until I could see the roof top of the nearby building from above [with chimney and coke can], the people were getting smaller and eventually I could see the whole field and the adjacent gardens plus the road in the distance [I'd guess I must have been at least 20-30 meters above].  All this was as clear as the day, even though it was from the corner of my eye. If you are that high up it doesn't make much difference about looking directly at something I could still see what was there. I didn't want to change my view because I didn't want to lose what I was seeing. When I eventually did, I 'shrunk' instantly back to the ground where I was below any roofs and could not see any further than you do normally.  I didn't dream this as I was completely aware of the strangeness and was enjoying and observing it and I couldn't wait for the ride to end to tell my friend. ETA: We did try and check if there was a coke can on the roof but it was too high to see from any angle.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32g9cg,DestroySocialJustice,4,Mon Apr 13 16:35:20 2015 UTC,Damn Xbox fan boy probably ran in and stole it.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32g9cg,beaker_meep_,2,Mon Apr 13 15:45:53 2015 UTC,And then broke it. Because he's an Xbox fan boy.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32g9cg,Xtremik,2,Tue Apr 14 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"Dude, I don't get it. The CCTV should clear what happened. The console was on the table and then what ? Where I live they have video cameras pointed right in the direction where the cashier is hence everything is caught on tape. The console just pop out of existence while was recorded ?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32g9cg,TimmyFarlight,2,Wed Apr 15 11:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is a weird detail. What kind of retail store has a camera trained on the entrance, but not the cash register/counter?"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32g9cg,Prawngirl,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:23:33 2015 UTC,Someone had already tampered with the camera. Probably the other employee. This is common in the US they tamper with the camera while a buddy comes in and heists the item they want.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,32g9cg,falling_into_fate,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:31:08 2015 UTC,Definitely buy a vita if you like gaming. It's a great handheld and pairs awesome with a ps4. Especially if you have a ps+ sub.
