VirginiaTech,3e5rfi,Purpleboo11,8,Wed Jul 22 04:13:24 2015 UTC,"Go to class Seriously go to class Use your professor's office hours Ask questions in class if you don't understand Do not ask questions to make your self appear ""more intelligent"", everyone knows what you're doing. If you're in Engineering, join a design team, hands on experience + a group of people you will call friends for years. When you have time, take a ride around the Blacksburg transit system, no better way to learn about something than to dive in head first. Do wait to buy books until the first week of class, professors will let you know if its needed or not. Learn to take good notes, makes exam week much less stressful when you can review for a class a day.   Beyond that I'm new to Virginia Tech (transferred in as a junior) so I can't answer questions about dorms or clubs or any of that and will be looking for advice here as well!"
VirginiaTech,3e5rfi,Micromeds,8,Wed Jul 22 05:09:41 2015 UTC,Seriously. Go to class. A lot of people fuck that part up. I know I did. And I spent years regretting it. Just go to class.
VirginiaTech,3e5rfi,Hellknightx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:42:27 2015 UTC,Seriously. Go to fucking class. I don't care what you'd rather do. Don't forget why you're at college in the first place.
VirginiaTech,3e5rfi,MaxAgbyni,3,Wed Jul 22 11:31:40 2015 UTC,"Go to all the freshman and beginning of the year events hosted during the first week and in your dorm. Go to the Hokie Hi picnic in Lane. Many of the offices on campus (Recsports, Career Services, etc) will have some type of open house or something for the beginning of the year. There will probably be a calendar closer to the start of the semester will all the things that will be going on during the first two weeks back. Clubs: GO TO GOBBLERFEST. So many different clubs will have a table set up. Also lots of free stuff. Check GobblerConnect for an idea of what clubs there are if you wanna plan ahead. Go to as many first meetings as you can to see if you find any good fits - again, lots of free stuff. Check in your academic department/major about any events or special meetings they might host during the first week. Same goes for other academic offices (Student Success Center, Libraries, etc). There is so much free food through meetings, events, open houses, etc etc the first week, and it can be a pretty fun way to meet people with similar interests or in the same major as you. There's a thing called YToss the first week of class where you can buy used dorm stuff. Go as early as possible and you can save money on some dorm essentials Just bring the essentials to your dorm - there's Walmart, Target, and Bed Bath Beyond in Christiansburg accessible by bus in case you realize you need stuff. My mom bought me way too much stuff for my dorm to be prepared and I ended up not using half of it and bringing it home at Thanksgiving. Bring clothes for cold weather unless you plan on going home before late September. It can get cold quickly in Blacksburg, or it might stay hot. The weather varies a lot during the Fall/Winter. Get some good rain and/or snow boots. Walking through the drillfield and on campus when it's gross outside makes class feel worse when your clothes and shoes get messed up. Walk around campus as much as possible, including areas where you don't have classes. Check out the duckpond, horticulture garden, and stuff on that side of campus. It can be a bit more calm. bt4u.org for the buses, learn the routes and what times they change in case you go off campus Read your syllabi ASAP. You can find out if all your classes have exams at the same time, and either switch your schedule some, or be very prepared ahead of time. I know too many friends who didn't read syllabi carefully and would have 4 finals over 2 days when they could have switched into a different class section to prevent it Buy your textbooks as soon as you know what you need and look online if you want the cheapest option. Most places have good return policies within the few weeks in case you find out you don't need them Get to know your adviser or another faculty member in your major in case your adviser isn't that great Find a study space that works for you - there's so many different places to choose from dorm lounges, the empo, the library, Torg, the bridge, etc, so it's really helpful when you find a place where you can feel productive Don't be afraid to get help from campus offices. Some of the staff might seem cheesy/stereotypical but it could work for you and help you in the long run Familiarize yourself with the different offices you'll definitely need to know (for example, Financial Aid if you rely on grants and loans, Schiffert if you get hurt or sick a lot, etc). Make the most of your meal plan, but also take the time to eat off campus. There's tons of great local food and it's reasonably priced since Blacksburg is a college town. Some of my favorite off campus food places to try: Benny's, Cabo Fish Taco, Mellow Mushroom, Green's, Soulvaki's, Bollo's, Sharkey's (wing buffet on Sundays), Macados, Marco and Luca, Mike's Grill, Chinese Kitchen (cheap good chinese takeout), Carol Lee That's all the random stuff I can think of, if I come up with more I'll let you know. Welcome to Hokie Nation!"
VirginiaTech,3e5rfi,blacksburghokie,2,Wed Jul 22 06:09:48 2015 UTC,"-As for what to do with beds it depends on what dorm and what you want. Lofting is best option because it gives you much more space. Some halls have small enough rooms that you must loft for it to work out.  -Don't know your major but if its med-small sized i would get to know your adviser. Good relationship with them is always good. Also career center has some good resources.   -relevant blacksburg is rather simple. You will surprise your self with how well you know it after the first two months. Suggest to the friends you make to go downtown to get dinner some time. Will help you learn   -exam week again depends on major and thus courses(Business will have it easy, engineering not as much) what i can say is that the cliche image of people living in the library during finals is false. Yeah you'll study alot and use study groups but it is not so bad that you will be pulling all nighters.  -extra note: dont do all nighters before any exams. not at all worth it at all. So many in my hall did not understand how it messes with your brain.   -I regretted not joining any clubs(had one). Make the effort to get into them first thing. Would recommend at least two. As the semester goes on you will benefit from already having a schedule around them.   work out and stay healthy. Mccomas gym is short walk away and is a fantastic place to stay healthy. The change in activity and eating habits plus any drinking you may plan to do will all contribute to adding weight. Not a whole 15 but a good 5 or 10 if you don't take care of your self.  as mentioned you can wait to buy books. Bookholders downtown is a great place to go once you know what you need."

Most do love teaching!  go to class... All of em. It's what you're paying for. And it's great prep for tests/exams.  there are many clubs and activities there that just aren't available in post-college life. Take advantage of it!

VirginiaTech,3e5rfi,Derrick012,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:27:01 2015 UTC,"Loft your bed for 2 reasons: you will spend less time in it, meaning you'll be more motivated to do work at your desk. and other people will not get in it when you're just hanging out nearly as much.  Also, get involved with clubs that actually do things. There are many clubs that might be a ""resume"" booster, but in reality employers want to see that you have interests and had experiences. Honor societies that you pay a fee and attend a couple meetings have always been useless to me. Play a sport and join a club that you associate with a lot.  To reiterate others' comments, go to class. 1. you pay for it, and 2. again, employers want you to be smart, but they also like to see that you care about learning for the sake of learning.   Lastly, don't complain about the weather. We get it, it snows in April..."
VirginiaTech,3e53m9,lyssesSgrant,3,Wed Jul 22 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"Couple things -- congrats on becoming a Hokie! It's a great community to be a part of. There's a lot of things to learn and your first semester or two can be overwhelming, but don't get discouraged. Keep your mind open and explore what's out there. Your first year as an engineering student is going to revolve around trying to decide what engineering discipline to major in. The aerospace industry is great to work in (I'm an Aero grad myself), but an aero degree also pigeon holes you a little bit into the aerospace field. It's a bit easier for a mechanical engineer to work in the aero industry than an aerospace engineer to work outside of the aero field, at least starting out. Just keep that in mind.   As for classes, I used this as a guide:  http://www.aoe.vt.edu/programs/undergrad/aerospace/aeroengcurr/aerospace-engineering-curriculum.html  I pretty much followed this curriculum when I was a student and never ran into any real issues. Just know that in order to graduate in 4 years, you will be working your ass off and won't have a lot of room in your schedule to take courses outside of the bare necessities.  I would recommend taking extra programming classes whenever possible. It's a great skill to have and if you can say you are proficient in C++, or really any programming language, that will make you much more attractive to companies.   If you want to end up getting into management, I wouldn't really worry about that until after you get your undergrad degree. A lot of engineers end up going back to school and getting their MBA eventually, which is where you're really going to learn about how to manage. Plus, once you get a little experience under your belt, you might find that you would rather get a technical Master's than an MBA."
VirginiaTech,3e53m9,jettj14,2,Wed Jul 22 01:49:39 2015 UTC,"If you're aiming for an AOE major, I'm gonna assume that you are currently in general engineering right now. First make sure that all your classes that are required for first sem gen engineering are either completed or in your schedule. The person that replied to this post before me had a link to a checksheet you can look at. From there try and see if you can pick up some classes from second semester, and fit them in your schedule for this coming fall. A common one to do is physics. It maybe challenging to be able to take chem and physics at the same time, but the fact that you made it into this college and into engineering shows that you're smart enough to be able to handle it all. It'll be a good way to see what college will be like in the future, too, as the classes will only get tougher and tougher from here. If you can't take any second sem classes, then I suggest just trying to knock out as many CLEs as you can. It's best to get those out of the way fast so that you don't have to deal with them in the future."
VirginiaTech,3e53m9,AznKwokBoi,2,Wed Jul 22 02:00:42 2015 UTC,"Hey! First of all welcome to VT!  Here is the generic course checklist for Aerospace Engineering:  http://www.aoe.vt.edu/programs/undergrad/aerospace/aeroengcurr/aerospace-engineering-curriculum-2016.html  This is a good place to start when figuring out your courses. That being said, you in no way have to follow this strictly as long as you hit all the courses required by the degree.  CLEs are fine to take whenever you want. Some people take them for interests in courses outside of engineering/science/math. They will generally be easier than your engineering courses (not always).   You probably want to try to take around the recommended credits the checklist says which is 17 for your freshman fall semester.  Most engineers take chem then physics then physics 2. Each in a different semester. You definitely can take chem and physics at the same time but it will add a decent load to your semester. It's definitely not impossible and taking both would depend more on your confidence and familiarity with the subjects and how good of a work ethic you have.  Taking a class outside of programming and business can kind of be considered the same as taking a CLE.  I mentioned that you don't have to follow the course checklist; if you don't make sure to try to follow all your core classes as suggested. These would be your math/science/engineering courses. I recommend following the checklist for these since it will make sure you hit prerequisites for future courses.  If you're planning on doing a minor, you should be able to find a minor course checklist like the one I posted for the AE engineering degree. Just google the department, VT, and ""minor"" for example. Based on that checklist I recommend weaving in the intro course for that minor your freshman year.  If you have anymore questions feel free to ask or PM me! Best of luck to you!"
VirginiaTech,3e53m9,_valo,2,Wed Jul 22 02:06:01 2015 UTC,Thank you! And I guess I didn't phrase part of it right: Is it a good idea or common to take electives other than the CLE's such as classes in business and computer science?
VirginiaTech,3e53m9,_valo,2,Wed Jul 22 03:03:46 2015 UTC,I don't think it is common unless you're trying to go for the minor.  I graduated as an EE with CS as one of my minors so I'm a bit biased about computer science classes as in I definitely think it is worth taking them.  The reason it is uncommon though is that they will not count as CLEs (I'm pretty sure but not 100% sure about business courses not counting as CLEs). They will pretty much count as nothing (to my knowledge) for your degree and the CS ones will be a significant amount of work. They will count towards your GPA. For AE a CS course might count as a technical elective but I'm not sure. I can't say for business classes as I've never taken one.  You will learn and be exposed to some programming as an AE but it'll probably be limited to Matlab and Labview.  I personally recommend looking into a CS minor but I am also unaware of the AE industry and how valuable it is there.
VirginiaTech,3e5hop,TheAmazingSpidermon,5,Wed Jul 22 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"rather than getting your cat declawed, have you tried talking to the landlord to see if they'd accept an additional deposit instead? or see if they'd be okay with claw covers? declawing is pretty much amputating a part of your cat's foot, which seems pretty excessive just to get an apartment, especially when that policy isn't the norm for this area. not trying to act judgemental or righteous or anything, just wanted to offer another possible option.    to answer your actual question though, the vet hospital as mentioned by another user is a good place, and typically low cost.

VirginiaTech,3e50cl,8cm8,3,Wed Jul 22 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"I would recommend trying to still take 15 credits this semester, this additional class can be either an elective or a CLE. The reason 15 credit hours is recommended (besides it being more or less the standard amount per semester) is that if something goes wrong and you have to drop/withdraw from a class part way through the semester because of poor performance, you will still be at full-time student status. If you instead drop below 12 credits this will make you a ""part-time student"" which will have consequences in terms of possibly losing financial aid and not being able to reside in a dorm."
VirginiaTech,3e50cl,ShittySuperlative,2,Wed Jul 22 01:12:15 2015 UTC,"If you're able to, you could try taking another math and make the following semester easier, not sure what maths you're taking.  If you know what major you want to, go to that department's website and look at their checksheets to see if you can take any of those classes there.   If those two fail, just take another elective. I took two electives first semester as I got out of English and Chem and couldn't take more math or physics."

Advisors' emails:  Terry Arthur -  arthurt@cs.vt.edu (540) 231-3984  Libby Bradford - bradfolg@cs.vt.edu (540) 231-3209  You could add another math class if you want to (I took Vector Geometry and Linear Algebra my first semester) to get ahead in your major, or something like that.  Again, talk to the CS advisors if you want to do CS.  They will set you up for success and give you possible options on what you could do this semester.  They will sit down with you and write a quick 4-year plan of what you need to do to graduate and then you can just stick to that."
VirginiaTech,3e50cl,Kikuchiyo123,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:26:06 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll have a look into it. Thanks!"
VirginiaTech,3e50cl,AznKwokBoi,2,Wed Jul 22 02:07:29 2015 UTC,"There are two ways to look at it.  One way would be that if you only take 12 hours of classes, then your first semester will be easier and it will be easier to transition into college life.  On the other hand, with only 12 credits, it might be easy to start goofing off and getting used to having nothing to do.  Another way to think about it is that if you knock out more classes when you are starting off and the classes are significantly easier, you can have fewer classes later which will give you more time to study (or take an elective you really want to take if you're breezing through your major).    It really depends up to you and what kind of person you are.  I would probably add another elective that you need (I'm not sure what the CLE requirements are anymore) because I feel like 12 is too few and you'll have too much time on your hands (better to have that free time after you're 21).  Alternatively, if you're sure that you want to do a specific engineering major (CE, ECE, CS, etc.), you could try to take one of your first courses in that major.  Also, World Regions is an awesome class."

VirginiaTech,3dyovx,mudo2000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:02:44 2015 UTC,Is our team even going to be good this year? Who's been keeping up with off-season VT football? Is Brewer still at QB or are there people competing for his position?
VirginiaTech,3dyovx,a_masculine_squirrel,10,Mon Jul 20 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"Brewer is still QB. Apparently our offense is vastly improved, but I'll believe it when I see it. It's pretty much set that Brewer is the starting QB unless the Freshman Dwayne Lawson is really good and Brewer pulls a Glennon, causing Lawson to pull a Tyrod.  Our defense will be one of the best in the country, we return almost everyone on that side. Same with offense really.   Keep in mind we lost a ton of people to injuries last season, hell we were on our fourth string RB by the end of it. Through all that five of our six losses was within a touchdown. This season should be a good one and our best chance to bounce back. Anything less than 9 wins is a dissapointment IMO and Beamer/Loeffler should step down."
VirginiaTech,3dyovx,techtechvpi,3,Mon Jul 20 19:28:19 2015 UTC,"Team is definitely going to be better last year, Brewer is absolutely still the QB, but he had spring to prepare, unlike last season.  We should have one of the top 5 defenses in the country and that will keep us in games."

VirginiaTech,3e1f35,bmd4567,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other commenters that say don't buy a tablet. If you absolutely MUST have a tablet, go for the fushitsu. It seems to be the best one the bookstore sells. Also definitely buy from the bookstore. That warranty is not to be taken lightly and you don't have to ship your laptop away to get service.   Back to subject. The fushitsu is really the only one with any new/decent hardware. The yoga 12 is not worth $2000. 8 gb ram? That will definitely not be enough for the more intense projects. Next up to bat is the HP. This one is simple. Do. Not. Buy. HP. Ever. People who bought HP's in my year were regretting them by the end of the 1st year of owning them. They overheat and the hardware is just not that great.  I don't know which fushitsu my brother got (incoming freshman as well) but I can ask him if ya want. I got the Lenovo x230t 3 years ago and its decent. The price is at least fair for what it is. I7 is nice and so is the 16 gigs of ram but it is pretty heavy and doesn't really fit into most laptop bags meant for 13 inch laptops (weird battery shape). It also overheats badly when playing games and the graphics card is ancient.   If you do go for the x230t make sure to completely wipe it. I'm serious. Lenovo installs bloatware onto it that will purposefully slow it down. It does work well with windows 8.1 but you will need to reformat your HDD (I had to at least) which is annoying, but not impossible.   Or you could get a normal (better/cheaper) laptop + USB tablet for much less than the fushitsu's. If you are on a budget and need the tablet, the Lenovo will work, but note it isn't a gaming laptop. It does do matlab and autodesk really well though."

That is, they are to be three courses of your choice* that are related to each other to give you insight on topics that you can use to expand your knowledge outside of BC. For example, I'm transferring in this semester from a community college where I took a bunch of computer application courses that Renee marked off as my cognate courses. I should probably say that they were applications that I can use for BC (AutoCAD, REVIT, Timberline, etc.), but I don't think they needed to be. I get the impression that the BC program really likes well rounded students which is encouraging.   See you in the Fall.  *I'm not sure if you have to get your cognate courses preapproved by the department before using them as credit, so you may want to check that.

I took it and it didn't save me any time. It was a massive headache where I wrote 40+ pages in handwritten journal / short essay entries along with 40-50 pages of typed long essays in total for the semester. It was all about this crazy stuff too. Topics included how technology is destroying the world (annoying when your was trying to become a CS / Engineering major), how breast fetishes in Western culture stem from breastfeeding ourselves + how advertisers take advantage of that subliminally, and how a Neo-Luddite societal change will happen based on the Mayan 2012 prophecy. I am not making this up lol. Since its honors the grading was harsher and I found no one in my class could consistently get the 90+ on the papers to get an A.   You can take English 1106 in the spring, which fulfills the same requirements and credits. I noticed that in the spring all my friends who took English 1106 had much less work than I did and they described it as an easy A. Afterwards I was really disgruntled with myself because I got a B for a lot more unenjoyable effort and work, but really for no extra reward. Remember if you do not get above a 3.0 overall GPA, there is a very good chance you can't transfer into your Engineering major and be forced to wait another semester! They're changing the requirements come spring semester 2016 to make it harder to get into your preferred engineering major and you need all the help you can get for your GPA. You never know how well you might do or you could possibly falter in a harder course. With the new requirements you especially need to focus all your attention on your engineering-related classes. Another semester is more money and gives you the stress that you might not get in at all the second time around, forcing you to switch majors or even transfer.  Sorry for the rant, I just do not want a fellow Hokie to make the mistakes I made :) You should really ask your academic adviser these kind of questions, especially about fulfilling your major requirements. We don't have the info on what AP classes you have taken / college credits you already have, but your academic adviser does and she can help you make an informed decision with that information. A good resource to see if you have all your requirements down is the checksheets by college page found here. It has the info you need about class requirements for all majors, and minors too if you look on the left side of the page under the ""graduation"" --> ""graduation requirements"" panel. Also I would recommend World Regions over Psych, but one might be better for you over the other depending on what requirements you need to fulfill.  Good luck and welcome to Virginia Tech!"

From my experience, you can make your schedule however you want, as long as you end up getting all your needed credits when you want to graduate. Therefore, it should be completely fine for you to switch into psych if you so wish.   I actually took both classes during my first semester at VT. Hands down, I preferred world regions over psych. I took world regions online, and all we had to do was watch videos, read a chapter a week, and do some not so difficult quizzes. You can't really get a bad grade in the class unless you truly don't even put effort into it. Also, it was a really interesting class that taught me a lot about the world, and professor Boyer is arguably VT's best professor. I didn't like intro to psych much mainly because the topic didn't really interest me, and I only took it to get rid of an area requirement. I mean some things were kinda cool, but overall I found it to be actually a somewhat difficult class, because it was a lot of memorization for the tests. Some people would probably laugh at me for saying I thought intor to psych was hard, but idk it's just not the kind of stuff I enjoy learning about.

Psych was easy enough that I could've gotten an A (freshman year wasn't my best of years and I got a B in psych). World regions on the other hand has been one of my favorite classes here... Took it last semester and as an international student, I absolutely loved the amount of culture in that class, Boyer is hands down my favorite teacher ever and he's amazingly funny when it comes to giving class be it online or in actual lectures.  My advice would be to take psych now and work through it so that you can get an A which is completely achievable if you put the work down (it's an interesting class too so you'll like it), then when you need an easy class later on (sophomore year) take world regions. It helped me get some leverage with classes like accounting or Econ and helped me stay out of deep waters too.  Both are great but definitely keep world regions as a wildcard."
VirginiaTech,3dwkmo,blacksburghokie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:50:51 2015 UTC,"World regions is super popular at VT. My friends that have taken it loved it and the teachers really interesting. You can check out some of his videos on YouTube to see how entertaining he is. Look up the ""plaid avenger"" on YouTube. Im not sure if you have to take it as an online class. You might, which would make it easier (cuz you can work on your own schedule) but also some people like in person lectures.   To figure out if something will meet your requirements you can see on the Timetable of Classes to see what CLE area it is. Figuring out which CLE areas you need can be difficult if you don't have the sheet they gave you at orientation. One way you can do it is google VT graduation checksheets and pick a major you're interested in And count up the CLEs required and in which area numbers. There's also a tool in hokiespa to type in the classes you plan on taking but that can be a little more complicated having not taken many classes.   When I was an incoming freshman I chose to take regular English instead of honors because I wasn't in the honors program. I Didn't plan on applying to honors and didn't wanna have the extra work. I'm not sure what your plan is but I do think there is a significant difference in the workload if what I've heard is correct.   Goodluck with your scheduling, go hokies!"
VirginiaTech,3dwkmo,mybrisum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:01:26 2015 UTC,"Check the CLE guide for what courses count for which area. World Regions counts for both Area 3 and Area 7 (if your major allows to double count), while Intro Psych is only Area 3."

If you have wooden beds, then both can be on the ground (or both can be lofted if you get two kits). As per the website, if you are in the tower then you can only loft one bed.  Almost all buildings have their own laundry either in the basement or on the first floor. If your building doesn't have laundry, you will have access to the laundry portion of another building.

Your best bet is to walk around when you first move in and see how other people have their rooms set up. You get ideas and meet people. I liked the one bed lofted, other bed tucked under perpendicular, with the desk under the lofted bed besides the other bed.    Laundry costs $3 total for washing and drying in the dorms. If you have the opportunity to drive off campus though, there is a place by the police station that's much cheaper, quicker, and normally empty.

The r/gradschool subreddit is mostly against MBAs except for those who already have a career (use it for advancement) or who attend a super-elite school like Wharton or HBS or MIT.   The MBA market is totally saturated right now and the degree no longer gurantees a good job fresh out of school. I know a few MBAs who serve as glorified office managers around town.  On the other hand it is extremely useful for those who already have a job and are looking to move into management (sometimes the company will even pay for you to attend evening MBA programs). Also useful to restart a career if you are out of the loop and too far gone from school to be marketable as entry level.

But I can't rely on being there for that long or my own business working out, so I'm thinking that an MBA is good insurance if I needed to transition jobs (as you said, the market is somewhat saturated -- meaning that there is ""diploma inflation"" and the degree will be helpful for the positions I'm aiming for in the future).  I studied econ as an undergrad, so I have some of the fundamentals and know I'm interested in this, but my background is all theoretical. The big areas where I'm currently lacking are accounting, venture funding, revenue forecasting, and leadership, in addition to a comprehensive enterprise-wide view at the high levels of an established company.

The lighter the load, the easier it is to carry, and the higher the pass rate is for first-timers, the better the advising was, right? Horsefeathers!  College is expensive. Any time you don't take a full load, you're not getting your money's worth. If you're a strong enough student to have made it into Tech, you should be able to carry 16-18 hours successfully, maybe 19 depending on what the extra hour is. If they're requiring a class, learn everything they're teaching. Squeeze!  Having said that and your having said   Also, what are the easiest classes I can take that will also meet CLE requirements?   I would add... Well, let me preface this first by saying I wish it had been advice I'd heard and followed right out of high school myself:  Maybe you're not ready for college yet.  I say again, it's expensive. It's also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to live and work among experts and enthusiasts in whatever field interests you. Meanwhile, you're surrounded by a young, attractive buffet of whatever interests you. And experiential opportunities of all sorts you will never have again.  Dude, you gotta seize that shit by the balls.  And if you're not ready, that's cool. Take a year flipping burgers or hiking Europe or whatever. You'll be a better and happier student for the chance to shake the high school off your feet.  But your original question was how to fill out your schedule. I'd suggest something completely outside of your major. If you're there in Chemistry, take a Piano class; if you're there to Paint, try Business Calculus. So you could take your Creative Writing class (if they'll let you), then add, say, Geology. /u/AustinCorgiBart's class  sounds like a good bet, too. That should bring you to 17 hours.

If you want to get into the field of network admin, you need to find yourself a part time job at the NOC or something. Real work experience > what you will learn from BIT.  I want to go back to school after a year or two. Maybe for a MBA. Can't be the tech guy forever. Its just a phrase to learn the technical skill. Once again, find your interest. If you want to be expert in info sec. Start thinking about obtaining Security+ Cert like the SY0-401. 3.28 is not a problem. Real world job experience trumps GPA from my pov. I got a internship with less than that. I can't stress enough how important is job experience. I know so many of my peers that did nothing related to BIT over the course of 4 years, and struggle to find jobs in the end. (they all found something in the end). Be positive, and never give up. I got rejected plenty of times before landing my current job. CS ? If you want to go into the IT field... It is a very nice skill to have. or just learn them yourself on the side. Lynda.com is free for Tech student. Use it !   Good luck... hope some of these are useful."
VirginiaTech,3dn90o,jchenabc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"That's what I've been hearing, that typically BIT majors become consultants. I just want some room to wiggle around and try to start now in doing what I can to specialize in something. Whenever someone asks me what I want to do, I say that I'm probably going to become a consultant. That's followed by ""you don't want to go into consulting man,"" usually.   Your answers were helpful. Thank you."
VirginiaTech,3dn90o,jchenabc,2,Fri Jul 17 19:19:51 2015 UTC,You don't have to be in the consulting business. It's not for everyone. BIT prepare us to be generalist. There are a lot of things you can do. Just try to figure out what you like before senior year. I don't think I will be a good fit for consultant. You still got plenty of time.
VirginiaTech,3dn90o,frasoftw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"Consultant at IBM D.C. Probably consultant I know at least two other BIT majors I graduated with started at IBM with me. I have no idea, everyone I knew in BIT became consultants. I'm considering grad school for like Technology Management Learn about stuff you wanna do. When I was there tech had seminars in R you could take... that would have been useful to me now. If you actually like tech stuff your GPA will probably go way up. When I finished all the non-bit classes going into junior year my gpa was lower than yours, deans list the last 4 semesters helped that, classes are way easier to put effort into when you enjoy them. You'll take an excel/vba class at some point... everyone's experiences differ but I made a huge splash on my first contract by being boss at VBA. So either learn it on your own before the class or pay enough attention to do well."

I believe Verizon and Sprint have a subsidized option, Tmobile doesnt have contracts and you either pay the phone outright or pay for it in monthly installments. If you're looking for the absolute cheapest option though, some people say it's cheaper in the long run to outright buy a phone for a service at full price and then get a plan with whatever carrier works with the phone."

Really, any laptop with 8gb of ram (don't really need more but it won't hurt of you have the money) and a newish Intel cpu (sandy bridge and newer) will be fine for you. As for brands, go for something business class. Lenovo ThinkPad, HP Elitebooks, and Dell Latitudes will usually have better build quality than the typical laptop meant for home use. You're hauling this thing around all day and will want it to last. I use an older ThinkPad T420 for my engineering work and had no issue doing 3D CAD work. You won't need a tablet so that makes things much cheaper for you. Look around on newegg.com and Amazon for something that matches their specs. Don't be afraid to get a model that's a couple years old, the stuff you'll work on will run fine. Back to school deals ramp up in August so start looking now so you have an idea on how much things will cost.  Also, the specs the college of BC give for laptops are very affordable compared to the specs the college of engineering require. And maybe think about picking up a cheap 22-24"" tv or monitor to hook your laptop up to at home so CAD work is easier to see than what a small laptop screen would provide."

This is the first computer model ever to be sold commercially with a free initialization program and a free operating system, and thus the first computer product the FSF could endorse. (It was not sold that way by Lenovo, however.)  Before that, I used the Lemote Yeeloong for several years. At the time, it was the only laptop one could buy that could run a free initialization program and a free operating system. But it was never sold with a free operating system.  Before that, I used an OLPC for some weeks. I stopped because the OLPC project decided to make their machine support Windows, so I did not want to appear to endorse it. The OLPC uses a nonfree firmware blob for the WiFi, so I could not use the internal WiFi device. No big problem, I used an external one.  The results I worried about, millions of children running Windows on the OLPC, have not occurred. Instead we see millions of children running Windows on the Intel Classmate.  Before that I used machines that ran completely free GNU/Linux systems but had nonfree BIOSes. I tried for about 8 years to find a way to avoid the nonfree BIOS."

VirginiaTech,3d6ov6,AznKwokBoi,2,Tue Jul 14 01:09:08 2015 UTC,Literally.
VirginiaTech,3d6ov6,freckletan,9,Tue Jul 14 22:09:42 2015 UTC,"Due to Virginia Tech's recent mediocre performance, I believe that if we win this game there will be craziness in Blacksburg on the level of post-BC in 1999 before going to the National Championship game."
VirginiaTech,3d6ov6,magicpostit,3,Tue Jul 14 00:45:58 2015 UTC,"I was there for that, we rushed the field and I got to give Beamer a handshake.  It was an awesome night!  My boss is an OSU alum and he got us tickets for the game through OSU, so I'll be there with my VT gear surrounded by OSU fans and I would love nothing more than to look them all in the face after the game if we win.  I'll have the biggest grin on my face ever!"
VirginiaTech,3d6ov6,AfghanHokie,3,Tue Jul 14 00:57:03 2015 UTC,"I was there too! I was about 11 and my dad was doing his MBA at VT at the time, and we were right in the middle of the student section. That was the first time I ever saw airplane bottles, and there were so many of them. Watching the fans rush the field, take down the north end zone field goal, then watching the police just give up trying to keep them from taking down the south end zone field goal was fantastic."
VirginiaTech,3d6ov6,magicpostit,6,Tue Jul 14 01:00:10 2015 UTC,i.believe.that.we.can.win

VirginiaTech,3d6ov6,Kwyjybo,2,Tue Jul 14 04:23:20 2015 UTC,don't get your hopes up. It definitely could be a great game. We might even win. But chances are low i would say.

Our defense will be legendary but I'm still not sold on our offense. Also we have a storied history of losing the big games, last year was actually an anomaly..."
VirginiaTech,3d6ov6,techtechvpi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:46:17 2015 UTC,Yeah. Most enthusiastic people I've met will swear that our team has gotten much better since last years game. I don't doubt improvement but the biggest factor for a rematch such as this one (having played in highschool myself) is the mentality and attitude. OSU will be absolutely pumped up. They will want to get even. We will have younger players that may be talented but alot didn't see much action themselves in last years game. Alot of them might break under the pressure of what a titan team OSU became over their 2014 season. I agree with 25-30%. All i really want from the game this year is for it not to be humiliating. Huge crowd. Memorial day. lots of people watching. Worst thing would be to lose like 42-10 or something like that.
VirginiaTech,3d6ov6,manualLurking,3,Tue Jul 14 15:30:43 2015 UTC,Except you do realize we return 8 of 11 on both sides of the ball right? Hard to say we have loads if young players ready to break when barely 30% will be making their first start and the rest remember beating tOSU.
VirginiaTech,3d6ov6,DBHT14,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:25 2015 UTC,I had no idea it was 8 of 11. Thought we were losing at least 4 starters on def. My bad XD. The more returning players the better chance we have.

VirginiaTech,3d6ov6,cranberrysaus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:25:14 2015 UTC,They check sections.  Your friends can print out a duplicate copy of their tickets you can show to the usher to sit with them.  Just don't make a fuss if someone complains you're in their seats.

VirginiaTech,3d7c1u,Pedazo,4,Tue Jul 14 02:14:33 2015 UTC,"It's early decision, so it's binding. The admissions website says ED is for ""freshman applicants who have strong academic qualifications and select Virginia Tech as their first-choice school."" It won't improve your chance of admission, as it's geared more for students who are definitely committed to Tech and are strong applicants- many people get deferred in early decision, especially in the competitive majors."
VirginiaTech,3d7c1u,blacksburghokie,3,Tue Jul 14 04:40:40 2015 UTC,Well VT only does early decision (unless it changed from 2 years ago) which is binding so you have to decide if you definitely are going to go to VT and if so it probably does help your chances
VirginiaTech,3d7c1u,musicmann,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:33:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know whether it will improve your chances but it is much better to find out sooner than later. I applied early decision because I knew i wanted to go to VT, and I can understand why people would hold to make their decision on which college to go to. If you KNOW for a fact you want to go to VT, I would apply early. A lot of people in my senior year of high school regretted not applying early, because while the people got the weight of college acceptance off their shoulder, they still had to wait."

VirginiaTech,3d7c1u,spicyshrimp6650,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:07:31 2015 UTC,"I couldn't tell you if applying early helps or hurts your chances of getting in, but obviously get the best grades you can. From what I understand too GPA is looked at in the context of your school, not as a number alone. If you know 100% you want to go to VT there is no reason to not apply early in my opinion."
VirginiaTech,3d7c1u,darknight7884,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"If you have a shitty GPA, nothing is going to help, but if you are borderline, Early Admission can help because the stats of the incoming applicant class overall have not been analyzed yet, and they are not working with full visibility of what is to come.  On the other hand, if the ED applicant pool has higher qualifications than the regular decision pool, and you are borderline, then you'll probably get deferred and offered regular admission anyways.    TL;DR - It can only help, but might not, and is worth a shot.  Source: Former Admissions Employee."
VirginiaTech,3d4mod,techtechvpi,4,Mon Jul 13 14:12:59 2015 UTC,"River Ridge dermatology is pretty good. You can ride the TTT Hospital connector to it, as it's right next to the hospital"

VirginiaTech,3d4mod,joffreyisjesus,6,Mon Jul 13 14:43:57 2015 UTC,"I second Johnson, he removed a suspicious mole in literally two seconds. It would have taken me longer to cut a piece of frosting off a cake. Amazing skills.  Of note, he is the same Chad Johnson that played starting quarterback for WVU in the mid-1990s (don't hold it against him :p). He went on to medical school and fellowship, and ironically ended up in Blacksburg. His son Isaac plays QB for BHS and as I understand it, Dr. Johnson helps with offensive play-calling in his off-time.    Daniel Hurd is also a good dermatologist, director of the local derm fellowship I believe. You can't go wrong with either. Considering the wait time for seeing most dermatologists, I would just go to whichever can see you sooner."
VirginiaTech,3d4mod,Ut_Prosim,3,Mon Jul 13 15:35:38 2015 UTC,"Another vote for them here too - although we usually see Dr. Bohrnstedt in the same office. He and all the staff there have always been very friendly and competent, and they don't spam me with emails for cosmetic services like the doc I used to see over in Salem. They're a bit hard to get ahold of (at least in the Blacksburg office) over the phone sometimes, but otherwise no complaints in 3.5 years and counting so far."

VirginiaTech,3d3otx,guy76767,2,Wed Jul 15 04:55:59 2015 UTC,"One thing to note is that if you read the general articulation agreement for VT it stipulates you need to get Bs or better, and the VT Engineering agreement has no such requirement.   I had one C and was told that if I had anymore they could rescind the acceptance they were about to give me. So keep that in mind while doing your CC classes. Good luck!"

VirginiaTech,3cy8tv,Pedazo,9,Sat Jul 11 21:28:17 2015 UTC,Have you taken the SAT? A good score would probably help. Any sort of AP credit or dual enrollment might also be good.

For last year it looks like the average SAT was around 1920 (but depending on who you ask, some say only Reading & Math are important).

VirginiaTech,3cy8tv,DudeMatt94,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:08:56 2015 UTC,"I tanked the SAT (way below 1860) and I got in, I also took the ACTs and I think they took my score for that over my SAT's.

VirginiaTech,3cy8tv,accountTWOpointOH,2,Sun Jul 12 10:41:55 2015 UTC,"You can declare two majors, so definitely choose university studies as the second major, as well as the one you're going for. Take the sat multiple times and at least 3 ap classes in your senior year. My gpa was a bit lower than you, but I got into the college of engineering last year  fine. I did take a dual-enrollment calculus class second semester at my local community college as well if that helps. Whatever major your going into also matters a lot since engineering is significantly more competitive than other majors. Any other questions, feel free to ask."
VirginiaTech,3cy8tv,8cm8,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:14:24 2015 UTC,I got in twice with the same GPA as you in-state. Have you taken the SAT yet? I think your ACT score is within the range they look for. Do you have to declare a major? I didn't think you needed to. Being first-generation will help as well as if you're from a less populated area of Virginia (basically not NOVA). They're taking in more and more freshman every year and I think you have a better chance than most given the info you listed.
VirginiaTech,3cy8tv,tallhokiegirl,-5,Sat Jul 11 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"I'm from nova lol and most of my class mates are trying for vtech so that's why I'm so worried, I litterly cannot go to any other school, gmu is a good choice but I live 10 min away from it and my parents are REALLY strict so I will not be enjoying the college experience of partying, drinking and doing reckless shit at 3 am cuz I'm on acid, jk but you know what I mean."
VirginiaTech,3cy8tv,Avatail,2,Sun Jul 12 01:39:43 2015 UTC,"I was also looking at GMU (I live in NOVA as well), but if you do not get right in out of high school, just got to nvcc for 1->4 semesters. I went to community college and while the social aspect sucks, you save money & easily find a job.  Transferring to Tech out of CC is incredibly easy and I know an individual with a 3.1 who was accepted. Basically, if you're not accepted for the fall, do one semester at a CC, save up cash, and apply for the spring semester (or do a year at CC and go the following fall)."
VirginiaTech,3cy8tv,tallhokiegirl,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:55:27 2015 UTC,"Yea my parents are like right down the road from GMU too. But it's not like they'd just be watching you 24/7. You'd be in a dorm and have your own life. Plus the crazy shit that happens freshman year is limited to where you can transport yourself which is usually not far from campus and I doubt your parents would be patrolling that area every weekend.   How come you say you can't go to any other school? Radford is right by Tech and easier to get into. VCU is also easier, I think, and it's a good 2 hours from NOVA. There's also Lynchburg and Longwood and CNU. All pretty far from NOVA and easier than Tech to get into. And agreeing with what the other person said, there's always the option to go to NVCC for one or two years then transfer. I think one of the programs there guarantees you a spot at any state college."

VirginiaTech,3cy8tv,DBHT14,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:46:36 2015 UTC,You could apply to a school within the university that has lesser standards then transfer majors later. I got into university studies this year with almost exactly the same grades and scores as you so you should be fine.

I had VT Electric for a few years. Most utilities charge a deposit for the first month that you get back after a year if you don't have any late payments. I think VT Electric's was in the $25-30 range."

I actually think they let us split it up into 3 payments (one before service, one at first month's bill, and one at second month's bill). I am guessing that is what the crap ton at the beginning was.  I don't think VT Electric's deposit is that high, but I would imagine their monthly rates are about the same as AEP."

AEP and VT may have different rates so you might see a difference for the same number of kWh.  VT: http://www.vtes.vt.edu/rates.aspx"
VirginiaTech,3cx56m,mrost,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:48:13 2015 UTC,"Nothing unusual at all about those electricity prices, especially if you have a normal assortment of appliances and computers, TV, game consoles, etc. and electric AC/Heat. And if you're splitting between 2 people and it's still only $30-60 each then that's pretty low actually, unless you're living in a shoebox.   If nothing else, think of it as a head start on getting used to what it'll be like after college, your threshold for ""insanely high"" prices for utilities will be quickly redefined unless you're splitting with 3 or 4 roommates - my wife & I pay an average of $120-$145 a month to AEP, water & sewer to Christiansburg is about $50/month (probably could be a little lower, but I like long showers), Shentel 25 meg cable is $89/month, etc."

The desks can be more safely mounted to, again with clamps,  if you have a lip of at least 3 inches in depth.   Check monoprice for inexpensive arms but be aware that the difference between expensive and cheap is the ability to move the screens around much after mounting. So inexpensive arms are fine ergonomically but less great for easily moving a screen out of the way when it's not needed."

I'm a fourth year now and we only really started using our laptops either second year (depending on your professor) and definitely third year.  The basic programs that you'll need to have/learn is the Adobe Suite (Illustrator and Photoshop especially), maybe Rhino/AutoCAD (like I said, this really depends on your own initiative and your professor), and maybe maybe Revit (this is usually done on your own, and I didn't see it introduced until my third year).    Let me know if you have any other questions! I'd be happy to talk more (:"
VirginiaTech,3ctx3z,xcdo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"SSDs are much faster and much more durable than a traditional spinning disk drive. Both of which are really important for something that you will be turning on and off frequently and carrying around all day. Because of the higher cost per GB you generally want a smaller SSD to hold your operating system and the programs you run frequently (chrome/firefox, office, school software) and a larger external drive traditional hard drive where you can load up with pictures, movies, games, etc which you don't need all the time and can be left at home. A 250GB Solid State Drive is all you need for school only programs and can be found for less than $100 on its own.  Why you likely have to pay much more than $100 for one in a laptop:   Laptops are generally a little bit behind the curve on tech, so when they manufactured the laptop it may have cost more than $100 You usually aren't just upgrading the hard drive when you step up to the next laptop tier, you're also likely upgrading some or all of the following: CPU, RAM, screen resolution, graphics card, network capabilities, weight reduction, adding a touch screen, and a few other things People are used to large hard drives in the 500GB-1TB range so they assume that a SSD should be a similar size to be able to store everything. As such, manufactures tend to skip over the smaller cheap SSDs and go straight to the more expensive larger ones since the laptops with smaller drives don't sell as well.   TL;DR:  Can you still run the required software without one? Yes. Is an SSD worth the price on of just the SSD? Definitely. Is an SSD worth the price of going to the next laptop tier? Usually, but it depends on the price and what else you get by moving up. What I would recommend: 250GB SSD for school software and a 1 TB external drive for music, pictures, movies, games, etc"

VirginiaTech,3ctx3z,bent_my_wookie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:04:00 2015 UTC,"They aren't going to come check your computer. While an SSD is nice, it isn't necessary. They probably have that requirement because an SSD is much more durable, and they are tired of dealing with people who don't know how to take care of their computers coming in with destroyed hard drives and complaining about losing all their data.  Pretty much all you need to do is: don't drop your laptop, don't drink or set liquids near it, put a password on it, and don't leave it laying around the studio (they have been stolen before).  Depending on your working method and professor, you may never need a computer until fifth year, when you will have to do your thesis book. Some professors require project books or construction drawings in third year. Still, the school is very keen on high quality hand-drawings. Furthermore, a well made model is much better than any rendering. If you build it large and well-detailed enough, the photographs can come out looking like an actual building. If you can get good at those two things, you will set yourself apart from your classmates.  However, if you want to get employed you will need to learn the software (mainly Revit and the Adobe Suite). There are also other things such as Grasshopper (a plug-in for Rhino) that are good to know, although the Blacksburg campus doesn't currently offer a class in it. It took them until this year to offer a Revit course, and as far as I know there aren't really classes for other specific programs. For the most part, you will be on your own learning the software. It is in your best interest to learn it as quickly as possible.  Sorry, I really got off on a tangent there.  TLDR; SSDs are better, but as long as you don't abuse your computer it probably doesn't matter."
VirginiaTech,3ctx3z,DoTheHokiePokie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:45:20 2015 UTC,"From my experience in architecture, any kind of rendering will be your biggest computing task. But I believe that is heavy on the GPU and CPU (Most laptops don't even have a dedicated GPU.) Revit is the most intense program under normal use. My 4yr old laptop struggles with large revit models. Really for architecture, at least where I did undergrad, most 4th year students invested in performance desktops. Using my laptop, (7200rpm hdd, i7-2630qm, 6gb ram, 1gb radeon-6770m gpu) I definitely felt like I was well behind the computing curve. I look at the current spectrum of laptops and I am not too impressed. Most laptops are going to be a computing compromise...  But anyways, my impression of VT is that they focus much more on design, and necessarily using a certain computer program to do architecture. When I visited VT last spring, I talked to some thesis year MArch students who were still developing their projects using traditional mediums, hand drawings, models, etc.  Though since I was looking at the masters program, it may be different in the undergrad program."

You have to consider that in most places to live off campus, you'd have to either know someone with a place already, or start searching while you're still in high school and not in the same town as the university.   It would be a nightmare to expect many freshman to sign a lease before school starting, be financially prepared for all the expenses before moving in (even if their parents pay for it, it'd still be hard to take care of that without actually living in the same town), set up utilities, buy furniture, etc. AND get used to living in a new place AND prepare for college. At least by living on campus they can ease into ""living on their own"" and be conveniently located to classes, Squires, events, etc. so they can get familiar with the basics of the area.  I am very introverted as well and was not friends with my roommate, nor did I participate in hall activities.

VirginiaTech,3cia1q,AustinCorgiBart,4,Wed Jul 8 03:04:54 2015 UTC,"Usually, I find out about new courses via department or college emails.  Having worked simultaneously on a degree in Math, a minor in Computer Science, and a degree in Philosophy, many times have I seen emails for new courses that were relevant to those departments in their department emails - especially (but not limited to) cross-listed courses.  It seems that you're trying to get a CS course out to departments in CLAHS (College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences) and COS (College of Science), so see if you can't help your professor get in touch with the CLAHS and COS deans or maybe through the department chairs of the various departments underneath those colleges.  I'm not sure if there's an official process to this, but emailing either of them would probably be a good start.  Maybe ask if they would be willing to disseminate information about the new course via their college or department email newsletters so that interested students can see the new course.  The same for any other colleges or departments you think might have interested students.  EDIT:  Here's a list of departments underneath the CLAHS.  Also, here's a list of departments underneath the COS, although these link specifically to the departments' prospective student pages.  It should be easy enough to get to the department home pages from each of the department links, though."
VirginiaTech,3cia1q,FringePioneer,2,Wed Jul 8 07:46:02 2015 UTC,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if you are talking for the fall then it might be already late.  But you can still have a good class for the Spring semester (if the class is both semesters and not once a year).  You have to sell it to underclassmen like everything else. You need to determine what makes it appealing to each college/major and find some way to related to that college/major. You have to tell them why they should take those 3 credits as their area 5 class vs the regular area 5 classes taken by their college/major.  My experience was from back in the early 2000s when we were starting a class (Mechatronics). For starters our pool of students was much smaller because you needed to have Junior level engineering to be able to contribute. It was still a hard sell because people didn't want to use free engineering electives in something outside their concentrations. So what we did was figure out how to sell it to each Engineering major. After figuring out how to make it relative, we started having flyers and doing the department wide emails. But what I think was the best sales presentation we had was when we took old Mechatronics projects built by students and showcased them in classes. You just ask professors for a few minutes to do those demonstrations.  Our best demonstration was when we took an automated motion sensor paintball gun (back then they were still a lot of work vs getting a preprogrammed chip today) to a Mechanical engineering thermodynamics class, we got 19 students from that class alone. Which made things tricky because we were trying to balance the different types of engineering majors in the class.  Another thing that you might be able to use to sell a new class is if it is an easy grade or not and be honest about it. If it is an easy A, that is a big selling point. Of course have it be worded better, if you do the work you should be able to get an A. Lack of exams also helps sell a class, as in project based grades.  Anyways, I hope this info helps you a little to get you closer to the registration numbers you guys want.  Best of luck & Go Hokies!"

VirginiaTech,3chxnb,betsky321,3,Wed Jul 8 01:20:40 2015 UTC,"For finance you're required to take Math 1525/1526 which is Elementary Calc at the empo I believe. Empo class difficulty depends on the person, I am strong at math so I didn't mind being self taught. Empo classes tend to be more difficult than they need to be just because of the structure. As far as Finance classes, you need to have good algebra and basic trig skills for your classes, and having a good handle on calculus also helps. I think most classes, especially during junior/senior year, are all pretty quantitative. I'm a recent finance grad, so feel free to ask if you have specific questions."
VirginiaTech,3chxnb,blacksburghokie,2,Wed Jul 8 05:01:56 2015 UTC,"Finance itself is also a lot of math.  Math 1525 isn't too bad, but 1526 (multi variable and derivatives) is somewhat difficult to learn on a computer screen.  Intro to Finance is dirt easy, don't get fooled.  Finance Concepts and Skills is a decent bit of math, a lot of formulas to memorize and apply.  Investments is also math heavy - option chains, pricing models etc.  Managing risk with derivatives is math intensive - a lot more formulas.  That being said, I got a C in Math 1526 and did extremely well in Finance courses, so it's worth a shot.    Accounting is less math intensive than Finance is, but somewhat requires a different kind of person to enjoy it.  Both majors are very similar - I did the dual degree in Acct/Fin and only had to take 5 extra finance courses.  It's somewhat similar for switching from Fin to Acct."

Last time I was there, the bus going to Christiansburg--Nashville--Atlanta wasn't very clearly marked.  But, it's with the other megabuses, so it shouldn't be a big issue.  Usually it's the bus farthest back in the lineup.   How on-time you leave depends on:   A. How soon the bus driver coming back from his/her previous shift actually gets there  B. How many people there are, and how much luggage they have to cram into the storage compartment  I've been delayed for both reasons a few times.  I've also been delayed on the trip over because the bus driver couldn't go over a certain speed (or so he claimed) and, of course, due to traffic.   Those will all factor into how quickly you get to Cburg.  Hope this helps.  Edit:  I've never bought a ticket on the spot, but Megabus seems pretty lenient when it comes to some of its rules.

Any questions or need help, please let me know, I'd be more than happy to help out."
VirginiaTech,3c8nw9,DJVT7,3,Mon Jul 6 01:03:10 2015 UTC,You won't get a better teacher at tech than Chang. I took statics with him and I feel like I could teach that entire class just from what he taught me. I didn't even take advantage of his absurd office hours and i understood that class like the back of my hand. Take the class with him.
VirginiaTech,3c8nw9,SwaggerMonkey,2,Mon Jul 6 03:09:54 2015 UTC,I had lots of friends take classes with Chang & they loved him & thought he was awesome. Have no idea if it were a tough course though.
VirginiaTech,3c8nw9,Hokeis,2,Sun Jul 5 23:44:12 2015 UTC,I took it over summer 2 sesh. my tips are go to every fucking class and take down all the examples. For mine there was hw due every day and he would have a HW session after class where he would answer questions regarding the HW and just be all around helpfull while people did the HW. Just go to that too bc youll have to end up doing the HW that day anyway why not check if you have it right. If you pay attention and do all the work the tests will be a joke. Chang is THE best teacher you can have for this so the stuff i did pay attention to I got right. I was stupid and wouldnt pay attention all the time and that would bite you in the ass.
VirginiaTech,3c8nw9,VTJP,2,Mon Jul 6 01:44:35 2015 UTC,"Just graduated. I also had him for Statics, Deforms, and Dynamics. He is my favorite teacher at VT. Each class he'll introduce a topic with a short derivation, and then do a lot of examples on how to apply that topic. I HIGHLY recommend to go to his office hours whenever you get a chance. Even if you aren't having any real issues with the topic, he is super helpful and just a cool person in general."
VirginiaTech,3c8nw9,zildjiandrummer1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"I took it over the summer with him.  I thought he was a great teacher and made me understand the material very well.  He goes over many examples so pay attention in class and for homework he gives you the answer so you know if you are doing them correctly.  My biggest piece of advice is go to his office hours to do your homework.  Even if you don't need his help, you'll get your work done and have time every night and weekend to relax, and if you have any questions, he's right there to help and makes it so you figure out how to solve the problem."
VirginiaTech,3c8nw9,goatfester,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:44:45 2015 UTC,It's Roger. He will do everything he can to help you through it if you show up to class and his office and ask for help.

VirginiaTech,3c7q4u,Matt3414,6,Sun Jul 5 18:01:14 2015 UTC,"Just apply. You're obviously wanting to go to VT (to whatever extent/desire), and you shouldn't base your level of confidence, nor the decision of whether or not you apply, on everyone else's scores that got in.   I hope I'm boosting your confidence when I say I got in with lower scores, but extra-curriculars were my thing. 1870 SAT, 28 ACT, 10 AP Classes and tests, and I was 2nd quartile. The standards may not be as high for my major (I would think it's very close, however), but it should give you an idea of where you would be. I think you'll be fine, but apply early. They've got ~5,000 seats to fill and it's easy to say ""no"" once they've already accepted 6,000 others regardless of your credentials.  Edit: Also, talk to your VT counselor. Find out who it is. It's nice to keep in touch with them throughout the process, we had a couple emails back and forth each month."
VirginiaTech,3c7q4u,abe-solotely-social,3,Sun Jul 5 18:20:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say that you have a good shot at getting in, you have the SAT scores, TONS of extracurricular leadership, world travel going for you. If your GPA is weighted, it may be a little on the low side though.  There's always the possibility that you will be accepted to general studies, but you will be allowed to transfer into engineering later. A lot of people to this, and it doesn't really add that much more/any time in school.  Later on, when hunting for internships/coops, employers will love to see all of those extracurriculars so keep it up!  One last thing. If you haven't considered it already, try applying to Galileo or Hypatia, which are the engineering dorms. I participated my first 2 years and I really helped me meet/connect with other engineering students and was incredibly beneficial when I would be working on assignments well past midnight but the people in my classes were all on the same floor.   Best of luck!"

VirginiaTech,3c7q4u,DJVT7,2,Mon Jul 6 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who will be coming up on their sophomore year and also as someone who was not accepted to the engineering school I can tell you it is very competitive, almost everyone who isn't business or a specific science major wants to do engineering, but don't let that turn you away. There are also many other opportunities to get into the college of engineering if you do not get in right off the bat, and if you go undecided like me you might find another major that interests you like I did. That being said, I was in a similar situation as you, I had a 3.8 gpa, 650 math, 600 reading and writing and a 28 overall ACT score and I was deferred to my second choice major. Overall, I think you have a very good chance at getting into Virginia Tech and a realistic chance for engineering. Just don't slack your senior year and keep your eyes on the prize!"
VirginiaTech,3c7q4u,kingoftherealm,2,Sun Jul 5 18:20:43 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, if you don't get in, they've severely tightened the requirements since I applied 6 years ago. My SAT scores were maybe a little better but I had maybe 4 APs & nowhere near those extracurriculars. Are you in- or out-of-state?  Edit: I suppose it also worked in my favor to go Early Decision."

VirginiaTech,3c7q4u,DJVT7,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"I am currently a 5th year Aerospace engineering major, here's my situation and then compare to what you have.   Coming out of high school I got 1600/2400 SAT,  1200/1600 without the essay.    In high school we used the weighted GPA out of 6.0, I had a 3.99 gpa.  I only took AP Physics B and AP Calc BC.  I also scored a 26 on the SAT equivalent test (can't remember the name of it).  I still don't know how I was accepted here at Tech, question it every day but that just makes me work harder than I've ever worked before.    I struggled my freshman and sophomore year to cope with the college lifestyle and I ultimately had to re learn how to learn/take notes/study/ take tests...etc.  I finally figured out what works for me my junior year (also the most difficult in my major).    From what I've seen, test scores ultimately don't matter.  It comes down to work ethic, determination, and friends.  I openly admit that I wouldn't be where I am today, about to graduate in May without all of my wonderfully awesome friends.  I managed to turn my college GPa around my junior year and I've been averaging 3.4 each semester since then.    This may die in the comments but I hope someone sees this and see what I've been through and gains a little hope.

VirginiaTech,3bzxee,rickyhatespeas,-22,Fri Jul 3 17:51:07 2015 UTC,Soon? you mean in over a month?  This is likely to be resolved in under a week.  If this continues to the point of time where freshman are actually there (aug 15th-ish) then I understand.  But to stay up now for that reason seems unnecessary when there's plenty of time to show support for the cause and plenty of time to let people post leading up to coming to tech.

VirginiaTech,3bzxee,DJVT7,4,Fri Jul 3 19:56:38 2015 UTC,"My two cents:  1) This is an issue between big subreddit mods and the reddit admins. I respect that the mods were backed into a corner and used the only power they have (shutting down their subs) to make the reddit admins finally pay some attention. With that said, I don't feel this is an issue that the reddit community as a whole should be so closely involved; it's between the mods and the admins, let them sort it out. I don't think much of anything is gained by smaller subreddits like /r/VirginiaTech going dark, unless the mods here personally feel taken advantage of by the reddit admins.   2) Regardless of how you feel about point #1, understand that none of these blackouts are in any way in ""support of"" Victoria. No one has publicly released why she was fired, and it is foolish and immature to start crusading on her behalf without knowing any of the details. The mods are angry that they weren't warned of Victoria's firing and that there was no one in place to take up her very important duties. For all we know she was fired for very good reasons, and until reliable information about it comes to light it's silly to focus on it."

VirginiaTech,3bt84h,oxipital,2,Thu Jul 2 01:25:51 2015 UTC,"Hey, Congrats to you.   Solid state drives are great for faster reads and writes, but an important benefit of a SSD is the lack of moving parts.  Moving around while a HDD is spinning is a good way to get a head crash and have the whole drive fail.  That being said, you don't NEED a SSD.  As far as read/write speeds, this is actually a hybrid drive with 8gb cache, which means it will keep 8gb of data that you are using the most in the fast part of the drive that acts like a SSD, and the rest of the data that you aren't using right now in the HDD portion.  So the speed isn't as much of a problem here.  SSDs are cheap and getting cheaper + you will have free copies of windows while an engineering student, so this hard drive is pretty low risk if you back up your data.  Back up your data regardless.    The specs are fine for running most applications - even autocad - as long as you don't have chrome open with 10+ reddit tabs in the background.  Note that this does not have an optical drive, which you only need 1% of the time and external will be fine ($25-35)."

VirginiaTech,3bg4ni,Pravda_US,17,Sun Jun 28 22:44:36 2015 UTC,"Word of caution. If the police catch you in them or going in/out, you may be expelled.  Wait till after you graduate, and honestly they aren't that interesting relative to what you can see online. The only really cool thing about them is the danger/risk of actually going into them. And the fact that they make our power plant one of the most efficient traditional power plants you can find, what with the steam being used for heat rather than electricity in the dorms during the winter.   *edit: Also I don't know anything about the motion alarms, but I wouldn't advise going until you've graduated if you really must go at all."
VirginiaTech,3bg4ni,veazer,8,Sun Jun 28 23:46:07 2015 UTC,"It's really, really dumb. It's also actually dangerous and people (workers mostly, and a couple students) have died in the steam tunnels. If you're going to do it anyway...  Only break one law at a time. Be sober with all your wits about you. It's going to be really embarrassing to tell mommy and daddy you got arrested and face possible expulsion for doing something you thought would be kinda cool.   If at all possible, go with someone who's done it before. It's not hard to get in/out unscathed, but it's hard to navigate correctly and know where to pop out where you won't get caught if something goes wrong and/or you're being chased.   For the love of god, if you hear a ticking noise please GTFO. It's the sound of a pressure release valve before it goes off. Also, if you go in the summer it'll be a little cooler.   I'd say good luck, but I really suggest just not going. It's not that cool and you can get most of the experience without the possible legal issues by looking at the pictures online."
VirginiaTech,3bg4ni,lankhokie,5,Mon Jun 29 13:25:04 2015 UTC,"I recommend you do some research into tunneling in general before you go. I'm not going to recommend it as you could get injured or get in trouble with the school and/or law (it's technically trespassing). That said, if you're smart it's definitely possible. As for the motion sensors, the only place I knew of that has one (keep in mind this info is a few years old, and they may have added more since then, however unlikely) is at one of  the exits of the Barringer-Power Plant tunnel next to the chapel. You have to go down a sub-tunnel off the main tunnel to even get to it, so triggering it shouldn't be much of a concern. Again: be smart if you do it, but I can't advise that you do."
VirginiaTech,3bg4ni,bradklodowski,15,Mon Jun 29 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"I've been down there,  it's cool,  but not worth getting in trouble. The steam tunnels make an excellent place to hide exotic pets out of the Corps dorms though."

VirginiaTech,3b7wks,rWTFFF,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:48:58 2015 UTC,"This is a college town, you are going to get ID'd everywhere. Hokie House and TOTS even ask for two forms of ID."
VirginiaTech,3b7wks,double-5,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:31:32 2015 UTC,But! If you have a slightly decent fake ID. You are golden.

VirginiaTech,3b7wks,filthy_harold,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:28:42 2015 UTC,"Hokie house always asks for two forms. Sharkey's sometimes does too. Supposedly tots is the most lenient on fakes but a lot of bouncers everywhere might ask for two forms if your ID is from out of state. Some people say to never use your real name on a fake but other people say its a good idea since you'll have a secondary form like your student ID or a credit card to vouch for it. If a bouncer thinks its fake and takes it, just walk away, don't fight because then they might call a cop over to give you a ticket for a charge that could be for fake ID or identity theft.  Buying beer or wine at the grocery store is usually the easiest if you use a fake and pay in cash. I've never seen them ask for a secondary ID or scrutinize it that hard. They check for the birthday and hand it back. The cashiers don't see enough of then to know. The self checkout person usually just glances at it anyway. And don't ever try to buy liquor with a fake, ABC are Nazis about finding fakes."
VirginiaTech,3b7wks,Avatail,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:21:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah the pros of getting a fake name run along the lines of not worrying about someone trying to find you afterwards (even though this is highly unlikely). You can always get a second form of ID with the same name (like one of the pay as you go credit cards, or school id replica kinda deal).  Thanks for the info"

Depending on the professor, some are more willing to help out in that kind of situation than others. If it's a class that meets in a computer lab, it's not very likely due to the limited number of computers."

VirginiaTech,3b4y4u,Odnahc,2,Sat Jun 27 06:19:31 2015 UTC,"I was involved in it during the 2013-14 school year. It can be good depending on what you want to get out of it. There's two kinds of kids involved in curie from what I've seen: the gamer, introverted type who doesn't like to party and the kid who doesn't really give a rats ass and would rather just party and bs the entire thing. I was the latter and I hated it. Kids in the former liked it a lot more.  One thing you should know: there is a class. It's one credit and it isn't that hard, but it's attendance based so you have to go which is kind of annoying. It's also not a particularly fascinating class, as a lot of the time the class is just a series of speakers that have a bunch of lectures that play off as freshman orientation seminars. In the spring the class was on a Friday evening which made me hate it even more.  Also, if you're the party type, you should know that living in lee hall is not ideal. Lee hall, when I lived there, had the most students with student conduct issues, mostly because the RAs there are taught to be super strict and write up anything. It's not like Pritchard where most of the RAs don't give a shit. Not that getting written up is a huge deal until it happens a couple times, but it's something you should be aware of.   Overall, I found it all to be a waste of time. Most of the kids were very nice, at best they were fun as hell but at worst they were very strange. If you think you'd rather live in a hall where everyone is a little more quiet, do more gaming and science oriented activities and don't really party that often then I recommend it. But if you want to live in a party dorm then don't do it"

VirginiaTech,3ay9zz,tallhokiegirl,6,Wed Jun 24 13:52:54 2015 UTC,"Well, to be honest, the best things about freshman year were meeting my current roommates and trying out random new things. Since you said you already made friends here and have tried to make the best of your time here you'll have already done most things that people ""do"" freshman year. Did you go to the football games? How about joining a new club? Did you finish your hokie bucket list? Those are the kinds of things I'd recommend you to do.   As for a frat party, I'm sure if you asked any fraternity guys you know they'd gladly invite you to one and tad ah, frat party.   Edit: summer specific ideas. Hiking is a big one to do since we're right next to the Appalachian trail. Mcafee's knob and dragons tooth are some of the most popular hikes to take and they're relatively easy. I'm actually going to be heading to mcafees knob soon because I personally haven't done it yet."

And I am getting a meal plan this year :) I know a handful of guys at frats I'm just not sure if there's any that are particularly wild. It's stupid, but I just want to have gone to one and had fun dancing, nothing crazy.   I feel like it might be a little late for joining a club, esp with senior engineering coursework. But I want to do intramural volleyball again bc it was really fun.

If you want to get invited to frat parties, being a girl is a huge advantage. Just tell a frat boy you know that you want in on his parties, he probably wins brownie points for inviting girls, All the dudes that come alone/with a bunch of other dudes are the death of frat parties.  As far as summer things: Pool POOL POOOOOOLL!!  Seriously, its alot of fun to just hang out outside on a nice day.  If you don't have a pool, I know the TV pool doesn't check for residency!"

The drawbacks of this are that Sprint service can be patchy indoors, and there is no 4G internet in Bburg. However, if you are on campus or at home you can use wifi and this isn't really an issue. Additionally with a SIM card phone you can always transfer to different services when traveling to other countries."
VirginiaTech,3axktj,badaimarcher,2,Wed Jun 24 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"agree with this one for ""cheapest"" and functionality. for $35 a month you can get unlimited data/texts and 300 minutes calling OR unlimited calling/text and 250mb data. it has worked well for me this past yeah,and even though the coverage isn't the best, it is functional and has worked for me this past year. Also, you can definitely get O-K phones for under $100 (i got my lg F3 for 40 bucks off amazon)"
VirginiaTech,3axktj,ihavenodefiningpoint,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:15:44 2015 UTC,"my two cents:   Verizon has the best signal in Blacksburg, hands down, even through Hokie Stone.  when i was a student, i bought an unlocked phone through Amazon and went pre-paid through a company called PagePlus which is basically a reseller of Verizon but at much cheaper pricing.  instead of dealing with cards, i just had them automatically make deductions off my account every month so my service remained constant.  i chose this service because i didn't want to pay Verizon's full price (but wanted their service), was paying my own bills and didn't want to be tied into a long-term contract.  once i graduated and got a job, i researched RootMetrics to see which provider had the best service in the market i lived in and chose that.  unfortunately, it was a tie with Verizon and AT&T and since i could get AT&T service for half the price of Verizon where i'm at, i switched to a GSM phone.  this also gave me an excuse to buy a better phone, too!  hope this helps..."
VirginiaTech,3axktj,mybrisum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:45:24 2015 UTC,"That really helps, thank you. As a VT student I wouldn't need an unlimited data plan right? I've heard VT has wifi all around and I could use that for any/all purposes with a phone of my own. Correct me if I'm wrong."
VirginiaTech,3axktj,mybrisum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:28:07 2015 UTC,"that would depend on you.  i would recommend guesstimating how much time you'd spend on the phone and add a little bit for overage and choose the plan that fits this.  every month, monitor the time spent on your phone and if it merits moving up, then do so.  if not, then stay there.  that's what i'd do.   and you're right--there's wifi everywhere on campus.  set your phone to automatically switch to wifi when available and you'll save yourself some valuable minutes if you choose to pay for a limited minutes/texts plan."

Internet was a bit slower than advertised, as usual I would think. TV was fine. Some outages, none longer than 8 hours or so. Depending on the deal you get, especially as a new customer, it is pretty much worth it. My first year I got a year of HBO for free and it all was $85 a month.

The TV that comes with it is actually just the same things you'd get from an antenna anyways (AFAIK).  Remember never to be afraid to bitch at them about speeds because they can de-throttle you.

That said, I currently have Shentel's 25 meg service (no TV or phone) for ~$89/month, and I have no real complaints about the speed or the service, although I wish it was a bit cheaper of course.

And in the last few years there has been a growing effort to connect these individuals. With two major universities in the area, young professionals are going to be in the minority when it comes to the night life, but when you attend some of the young professional functions you realize just how many other people are in your age group and wonder where are do all these people go the rest of the time.  Groups you can join:   Blacksburg Young Professionals http://stepintoblacksburg.org/home/work/yp.html https://www.facebook.com/BlacksburgYoungProfessionals Up on the Roof (monthly event on the last Thursday from April-September) https://www.facebook.com/rooftopbburg   The New River Valley also has quite a lot of events happening throughout the year so I definitely recommend attending some of the bigger festivals, volunteer at ones that interest you so you can get to know more people. Some of the bigger events in the area are: Steppin' Out (Blacksburg), Blacksburg Brew Do, Summer Solstice (Blacksburg), FloydFest, Highlanders Festival (Radford), Rock The Blocks (Blacksburg). And, there's also sporting events. If you like college football or just tailgating, find your way to a Virginia Tech home football game which are the 6 or 7 biggest events each year. VT fans are very welcoming and I find are very quick to share their tailgate with friends and strangers.  Let us know if you have any other questions and welcome to Blacksburg!"
VirginiaTech,3adwob,next3days,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:29:43 2015 UTC,"Hi all,  Thanks for the replies so far. I'm coming from MI (and before that, MN) so winters shouldn't be too bad in comparison. Out of curiosity, how's driving in the winter with the mountains and all? I'm coming from a pretty flat place.   Those places have also gotten me to be pretty outdoorsy, so here's a brief list of things:  Climbing (planning on joining Crimpers shortly after I move) Hiking Biking (mostly road these days, may have to get into mountain) Kayaking, canoeing Social sports (i.e., did an adult kickball league recently, tons of fun) Also just generally getting out an exploring - day trips to nearby towns or day hikes Finally, just hanging out drinking good beer and shooting the shit  Cool! Thanks again everyone for the feedback so far  Edit: Also live music. Small shows at bars to bigger festivals. Going to try to check out Floyd Fest if I'm a little settled by then"
VirginiaTech,3adwob,parannoyedandroid,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"Driving in winter is fine, it doesn't snow here much but depending on where you live, it'll suck to deal with. If you live in town, driving in the snow isn't an issue except in neighborhoods, they're really good about clearing the main roads but if you live outside of town/ down the mountain/ more rural, you're gonna have some trouble for a couple of days after a good snow. We get two or three big ones a winter, I'd say.  You'll have an easy time finding outdoor stuff to do, and as for bars I really recommend the Underground pub. Older bartenders, they're awesome guys who'll shoot the shit with you, and you'll easily find older folks there (mid twenties and up) who are friendly and enjoyable to talk to. It's definitely the place in town where I feel 100% comfortable talking to strangers. The bartenders at the Cellar are usually good too. Both bars have great food."
VirginiaTech,3adwob,anabundance,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:08:08 2015 UTC,"Since you're outdoorsy, you should have no issue finding plenty to do in this town and the surrounding areas. There's pretty much no end to the outdoors opportunities around here. Since you're interested in Crimper's already, I'd say that's a good way to go. You'll find like-minded young professionals who also do a lot more than just climb. There's also the VPI Cave Club, which has a committed group of outdoors folks who do more than just cave and many members are older than college age.   Past that, the downtown scene is pretty fun and has good music if you know where to go. If you want to avoid the super college bars (unless you like them, in which case nobody will think it's weird if you go), Gillie's, Sycamore Deli, and the Cellar all have live music regularly."

I think Dr. Binoy is offering a multi-processor course, definitely one of the toughest courses as VT.   Also Digital Design II and VLSI ( Both are 4xxx level) is something you can look into.

They can recommend you for a GTA which is department funds, or GRA which is usually from their research funds, the school and departments also have GAs. I dont think we have any faculty giving out wage jobs in my department. ISE pretty much only funds PhD students, i think there have only been a couple fully funded masters students and they were special cases or had brought in their own funding from a outside company.  Your graduate program coordinator is probably the best person to ask, they tend to know everything and can almost always point you in the right direction. Even if they cant help you in this situation they are a good person to develop a working relationship with early on."

VirginiaTech,39wv58,Bobcat47,4,Mon Jun 15 22:39:34 2015 UTC,20 dollars for a full day is normally priced but that 7.50 per hour is ridiculous.

VirginiaTech,39wlp3,lucygirlz,4,Mon Jun 15 13:40:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't been on the Huckleberry at night, but I still feel like it's not really a good choice in the dark, even if you have a flashlight.  If you're a big strapping fellow that doesn't afraid of anything, then do what you will - but there's plenty of semi-isolated spots where if you did happen to run across some whackjob or have a medical issue or something, the chances of someone else being around to help you right away are real slim, especially since I think the trail's not officially open after dark.  Honestly if I was in the OP's shoes, i'd just run along the streets in/around/near VT, plenty of streetlights."
VirginiaTech,39wlp3,Snowflare182,3,Mon Jun 15 15:33:29 2015 UTC,"Very true. I didn't think about it being closed at night - I suppose it is. I imagine there are some people commuting late at night from Christiansburg or vice versa on the trail.  Yeah, I'd just run along the streets as well."
VirginiaTech,39wlp3,lucygirlz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, besides roads there isn't too much.  There are some decent roads to run on with good lighting that, in my experience, don't have much traffic though.  Lee street is a giant hill that is pretty well lit with no traffic. If you go down main street you can turn on airport road and then it connects to southgate which gets you back to campus for a large loop.  I've ran on the Huck at night and I don't anymore, I've seen skunks on and there's no lighting at all."

Very easy, albeit boring as all hell.  2) lab experience at VT really isnt too hard to come by if you put yourself out there and talk to professors and researchers. One of my friends was stressed about a finding a lab job as a senior because she didnt have a competitive gpa. I hooked her up with a list of life sciences researchers and she had several offers within a few weeks. Remember that we're a huge research institution so these opportunities exist if you look in the right places. 3) off the top if my head, i cant think of any professors that are must-avoids. All are pretty good, and a lot of it is based on personal preference anyway."
VirginiaTech,39q6gy,total_carnations,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:32:23 2015 UTC,"1) Cool, I didn't see it on the degree checklist, but read a semester worth of statistics was required so I was confused. Now that you've told me I see it plain as day on the checklist. Feel dumb now.  2)Yeah, I was told that about my previous institution(I'm a transfer) about putting yourself out there and there just wasn't any positions needing someone of 0 experience and I couldn't even get a call back when I offered to wash dishes in trade for training when it was available. So was hoping Tech had a few more resources(understatement) and it would be easier to find a place to begin working.  3) That's good, there was a couple at my previous institution that had a penchant for putting people to sleep early in the morning. I did not know and took their 8am and 9:30am classes and it was one of the worst class experiences I've ever had. Left me feeling drained for the rest of the day lol.  I've got the option due to my credits of not taking physics side by side with Organic Chemistry, good idea, or just get them out of the way so senior year is a cakewalk?"
VirginiaTech,39q6gy,jreese319,2,Sat Jun 13 20:45:20 2015 UTC,"Depends. I did not think that physics was too bad, but I had taken it for a year in HS.

Talk to an advisor and they might waive it for you. But regardless it's the easiest class you could take at tech Faculty members do come in and present what they're teaching/researching so it would be a way to meet them and ask them about their research interests. A lot of what's covered is basic how-to-get-through-college stuff and how to do all the administrative stuff you'll have to do. And as for specific classes, the requirements for a bio degree should be on the biological science page on the vt.edu site. If you have any other questions about specific classes, I would suggest talking to an advisor. I took Greek and Roman Mythology as an elective.

I know one problem we had in Electrical Engineering was getting PSpice running.  They would only help you get it installed/running if you had one of the actual recommended tablets.  For everything else, you were on your own which definitely put you at a disadvantage.  I actually liked my Fujitsu tablet and it still works after 7 years.  I used it for writing all of my notes.

It turned off after he hit it, and one of the cops parked in front of the new theater building walked towards him, gesturing for him to come over. He did, walking over with a conciliatory gesture, and was arrested. The light came back on a few minutes later.

The graveyard has no factor in this.  I remember there was also a ""SUBS"" neon sign in the window as well, so that could be the aforementioned sign that was broken and thus a factor in the cost.    Even the owner says ""The last thing I want to do is ruin someone’s life over a broken window"" he never mentions the graveyard.    Based off of quick google searches, the glass should run $600 before installation and the sign is about $400.  So $1500 after labor, especially if he doesn't have a wide variety of places to shop for window repair or purchasing signs in the area, doesn't seem unreasonable."

VirginiaTech,39g6ml,a905,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"I really, really recommend bringing as little as you can get away with. Moving in and out of dorms sucks, so move as little as possible. Some essentials include: 1) A fan. Even if you happen to have a dorm with a/c, fans are useful to drown out noise.  2) An umbrella. It rains a lot and often without warning.  3) Waterproof shoes/boots. See above about how it rains a lot.  4) A WINDPROOF jacket. Whether this is a shell (like a raincoat), or a insulated jacket, make sure you have a windproof layer. It gets pretty cold in Blacksburg but the really miserable part is the wind. If you can cut the wind and put on layers underneath, you'll be fine.   Other than that, you can wing it or buy things you need in Christiansburg once you're here."

Get yourself a comfy one for like $40 and you'll be happy. Benefits of your own chair: its more comfy, you have an extra chair for guests to use. This means more people are likely to come to your room and sit and talk. This leads to more friends I found. It's simple but worth it imo."

VirginiaTech,39ciu5,kvenaik696969,2,Wed Jun 10 21:06:49 2015 UTC,"So you're going to be a freshman here as general engineering, correct? If so, then I don't think you should have much to worry about. Especially if you can and are ready to learn a lot of math/science courses. All engineering students start out as a general engineer major, and once you finish your freshman year, you pick your specific major (in your case, computer science). If your GPA is above 3.0, you are guaranteed to get your first choice major.  In all honesty it was not too hard to get that 3.0. You're gonna be taking classes like general chemistry, foundations of physics, english, and calculus. Also, you're gonna have to take some general engineering courses, and to be honest those are what I would worry about the most if anything. I had some trouble in the engineering courses but still managed to get out with solid grades. In my opinion the other classes were not too bad either, and I was able to meet the requirements. All in all, if you study well and can learn this stuff and are serious about becoming an engineer you shouldn't worry about not getting a 3.0, it is very manageable."
VirginiaTech,39ciu5,AznKwokBoi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:30:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that speedy reply !  I was talking to some other Indian students who had recently gone to VT and they expressed the same thing - it isn't as hard as what we're used to. What I still don't understand is that if it isn't that tough to get a 3.0, then probably 80% of students (maybe) get 3.0s. If they're all guaranteed their first choice, how does it work out ?"
VirginiaTech,39ciu5,AznKwokBoi,2,Wed Jun 10 21:34:30 2015 UTC,"I am not entirely sure what percent of general engineering students get a 3.0 every year, although yes my estimate would be around 75-80%. Most of my friends who I knew in general engineering got above a 3.0 easily as well. I guess each department kind of knows how many people are expected to get a 3.0 or higher every year, and they are able to have enough classes and professors based on how popular the major is. For example, the very popular engineering majors such as mechanical probably have lots of professors teaching because they know lots of students are gonna choose it. That's just my guess, I'm not entirely sure how they fit everyone into the major they want, but I just know it usually works out."

I've signed a lease for 2015-16, but I've talked to the landlord and I can get out of it. It's a 1 bedroom in Sturbridge Square and is $740 a month with no utilities included (water is paid in addition to your rent on the same check, it's about $12 a month). It's also a converted two bedroom (the second bedroom has a lock on it and isn't accessible. I don't know if Sturbridge would be open to opening it up as a two bedroom, but it's a conversation you can probably have). The landlord is totally down to swap out the lease as a technical sublease, you'd just have to pay me for the security deposit (the one I paid would remain with Sturbridge).  It's a really solid apartment, pretty massive for a 1 bedroom. There's a living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom, and 1.5 bathrooms (one attached to the bedroom, I don't use it since I've got the other one). It's on the top floor, really quiet, and super convenient. There's a bus stop right next to the complex.  If you want more information, let me know! I can send you a message with some photos."

Sunday brunches are popular at this restaurant, even for those who consider themselves unrepentant meat-eaters;  you can go to Mike's Grill for a burger but i think they're closed during the summer...for a burger/sandwich alternative, you could always try Sharkey's downtown or  Macado's which is located on University City Blvd. across from Kroger;  if you're feeling kind of rich, you can't go wrong with microbrews and a steak at Bull & Bones on South Main St.    as a former employee, i can't help but recommend Benny Marzano's on Draper.    distance-wise from campus, you can walk to Benny's, TOTS, Cabo, Souvlaki, The Cellar and Sharkey's.  every place else you have to drive to.  hope that gets you started..."

VirginiaTech,38vf83,kheup,2,Sun Jun 7 12:41:37 2015 UTC,"Anything and everything outdoors. That was a big draw to the area after spending my undergrad years in the mid west. Hiking, kayaking, fishing, all that good stuff. I'm down to play any kind of sport, so if there's any summer leagues still open for registration is love to hear about them."
VirginiaTech,38vf83,kheup,2,Sun Jun 7 13:14:58 2015 UTC,"If you have a kayak and want to do some fishing check out the New River Kayak Anglers page on Facebook, if you need to rent a kayak tangent outfitters in Pembroke is a great place to do it.

I used to work there and know all of them personally, they know more about that river than anyone in the area, they'll tell you what'll catch fish in what conditions. (I haven't been in VA for awhile but typically this time of year if the water is clear you'll wear out bass on soft plastics). Let me know if you have any kayaking or fishing questions about the New I'm familiar with every stretch of water from the dam to WV, if I can't answer the question I'll be able to point you in the right direction."

VirginiaTech,38uzc3,hokiehivpi,3,Sun Jun 7 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"I believe /u/yamnave is right about the scores. If yours are high enough, MAKE SURE you get placed out. I had heard that, but my advisors didn't do it for some reason. Then I called the school to ask about it, but the dumbasses who answer the phones don't know anything, and they were just like ""uhm idk what you're talking about."" But of course once I got there I had friends who had been properly placed out. Sucks that I didn't cause I would have had an extra free elective to put toward my double major. The lesson is, in a big place like Tech you've got to learn to be your own advocate. Nobody's gonna take care of things like that for you."
VirginiaTech,38uzc3,smittywjmj1,2,Sun Jun 7 01:54:38 2015 UTC,Happened to me too. I should have placed out of two semesters of comm but instead I had to take comm and finally got it sorted out so I got credit for two semesters of free electives.
VirginiaTech,38uzc3,kheup,3,Sun Jun 7 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"I got out of the first English class with a 580 in writing. If you have to take an English class, take it with Mooney. Mooney will not require any journal entries and there will be 3-4 assignments (essays) for the entire class. There are no tests, just attendance and the essays.   He will cover your entire essay in red and black ink, and at the end of it you will not get lower than an 80 on anything. I got an A in that class and never brought more than a pencil/pen or the essay due that day to class. He does not tolerate you being on the computer unless you can prove you were taking notes, and he will call you out if he thinks you are goofing off. I didn't even bring my backpack to that class.  If you have to take an English class, I can think of no better (easier) person to take it with. The big essay (4-5 pages OH NO) was about a movie. For my class it was Thelma and Louise. At the end of the semester, he lets the class determine the weights for the assignments.   Great class 10/10.  EDIT: This was for English 1106"
VirginiaTech,38uzc3,jb7150,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:15:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice! I have a 630 on english so hopefully I'll be in the same boat. I looked at the time table of classes though and it appears Mooney is only teaching Honors Freshmen English this coming year so I guess I won't be able to take his class :( Or maybe I will go for honors, though I guess it'll be different from 1106.   Thanks again!"
VirginiaTech,38uzc3,jb7150,2,Fri Jun 12 03:16:37 2015 UTC,"He may only teach 1106 during the spring semester. That's when I took it. I know absolutely nothing about honors English.

VirginiaTech,38uzc3,Yamnave,2,Fri Jun 12 15:01:40 2015 UTC,Four years ago it was above a 600 excluded you from the first semester and above 700 excluded you from both. May have changed.

I'll be damned if I'd let my employees' health suffer rather than spot them a long lunch"
VirginiaTech,38ttg8,Killfile,2,Sun Jun 7 11:57:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, seriously listen to this advice - after I graduated college, I went about 5 years without seeing a dentist. I rationalized it away by saying I couldn't get the time off work, it was too far away, it would be painful, I brushed my teeth and used mouthwash so they wouldn't find anything anyway, etc.  Eventually had a searing pain one afternoon after biting down on a french fry - finally went in, and ended up having to have all 4 of my wisdom teeth pulled, plus 4 or 5 fillings.  Maybe a little extreme compared to your situation, but you never know what'll come up the longer you put it off - and emergency dentists are going to be pretty much the only ones open on weekends.   Anyway, to at least offer a couple that I can recommend, even without weekend hours:  There's a dentist on South Main in Blacksburg that i've heard coworkers have good luck with - https://www.nrvdental.com/  Or if you feel like going to Christiansburg, I can recommend the one my wife and I have been seeing for a few years since we moved to the area - http://www.nrvdentist.com/"

Writing it off as ""they were crazy, they kill for no reason"" is a bad precedent when dealing with mental illness. She clearly had a motive, and confessed to murder in the first degree (meaning it was premeditated), she just hasn't clearly made public what the reason was.   She certainly was/is mentally ill, but saying ""her motive was she was crazy"" is an oversimplification.  It definitely doesn't help, however, that the article is written less like a news story and more like a crime drama. I realize some enjoy this style, and I don't really have an issue with it, but I would like to see a less flowery explanation of events."
VirginiaTech,38ghgn,Notmiefault,3,Thu Jun 4 12:32:02 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry I guess I didn't write it clear enough.

VirginiaTech,38ghgn,Bojangly7,3,Thu Jun 4 18:11:49 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, she was having a hard time finding friends on campus after getting expelled from the Corps, etc. She was probably getting frustrated in trying to find friends and losing self esteem. Then, she found what she thought was a good friend in Sam, only to have Sam tell her she was an ""experiment"". That probably hurt really deep and was the last straw for all of the frustration and anger she had built up until then. Her emotions took over and for a short time her ""love"" for her turned into pure anger when she found out it wasn't mutual.  Most people have the self control not to harm someone over something like this though."

Whether you go the medical or graduate school route (I'm both as an MD/PhD), research is a huge part of biomedical engineering.  If you stick around for a Masters, you want to make sure the research you're interested in is there for you.  If you go medical, they expect significant research experiences as an undergraduate.  Essentially, find something you're passionate about!"

I'm leaning more towards going to medical school after my undergrad, as I'm not super crazy about research (I worked at Georgetown University for around seven months, and I didn't find it extremely interesting). For college, I think I'm going to go with UVA, since their biomedical engineering program is older and I believe will give me more opportunities."
VirginiaTech,38gwke,AznKwokBoi,5,Fri Jun 5 01:32:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not too knowledgeable about this field of engineering but I'll give it my best shot. Look to see which school can offer you more in terms of areas of research that interest you. UVA's biomedical engineering program seems to have a lot to offer, while VT's is kinda new so they might have less. Whatever you pick, make sure you do it after looking to see where you can benefit more!  P.S. I love how you called it ""School in Charlottesville""."

VirginiaTech,38hs14,kheup,20,Thu Jun 4 09:58:55 2015 UTC,"Ducks are paired this time of the year. Most every duck on campus is a mallard. Drake (male) mallards have a green head and are generally slightly larger than hen mallards (female) ducks are mostly brown. It's very unlikely your seeing the same ducks. For most species of ducks it's nearly impossible to tell unless they have a band on their leg. Ducks mate every year at which point they pair up. You might see two drakes with a single hen, that is generally because one of the drakes was unable to find a mate, when it comes time the lone Drake may try to 'rape' the hen.   Ducks are awesome. There are many different  beautiful species that pass through the NRV, though mostly you'll only see mallards near campus. All ducks mate in similar pairing fashion. They all make different noises and act slightly differently. Their behavior is very fun to watch. If you have any other duck questions I should be able to answer them.   Source: duck hunter."

If you're actually curious about the CPE/EE side, perhaps go and look up thing about these majors, see if they interest you? It's best to know about a major before deciding if you hate it or not.  Good luck in whichever path you take. Engineering is hella hard."
VirginiaTech,38640b,AznKwokBoi,4,Tue Jun 2 03:12:27 2015 UTC,"Im going to start off with Im a CPE Senior who really dislikes EE stuff. I would say stay in CPE. You'll know fairly quickly if you can at least stand the EE stuff after you take Circuit Analysis, one of the first sophomore courses that are strictly EE. Plus there are only a few courses that are strictly EE and you can set your tech electives to be more programming orientated (or even go for a CS minor and see if some of the courses will double count). I just focused on the courses with more programming like Network Applications or Cyber security.   If you decide that you really dont like EE, then its still early enough after circuit analysis to switch into CS without too much hassle. You might run into some issues of C++/Java syntax but that isnt too difficult."
VirginiaTech,38640b,da_frenzy,2,Tue Jun 2 04:15:44 2015 UTC,"I agree.   If you're unsure about the EE side but are interested, do CpE instead of CS.

Pretty sure I got right on the edge of the score that corresponded with the suggestion of dropping gen chem and adding a lower level chemistry course to review the absolute basics, but I ended up with a B+ in both semesters of general chemistry.

VirginiaTech,383nlu,hokies2019,11,Mon Jun 1 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"a lot of people rush in the fall but to be honest I'd recommend going in the spring so you can have a semester to adapt to college life, make some friends outside of your brotherhood, and just overall get a lay of the land. not to mention spring pledge classes tend to be slightly larger (making it more fun imo) and the pledge process slightly easier due to warmer weather and sometimes a shorter time period.   as to which frat you're going to join rushing in the spring will help you learn who's who. aside from that really just rush around and meet a lot of fraternities n just choose one that you see yourself fitting in at best. I would personally check out ""upper mid"" tiers like delta sig, tke, pi lam, pi kapp for the best mixture of social life and brotherhood"

VirginiaTech,383nlu,AlwaysChildish,9,Mon Jun 1 21:57:14 2015 UTC,"Your question assumes that you should rush.  Like /u/antw205 said, ""make sure you make the best decision for YOURSELF"".  Make sure you're rushing for good reasons.  Not everyone is in a frat, and you can have a very good time at Tech without one.  I'm not saying this to diss frats or brothers or the greek scene in general.  Just be circumspect."
VirginiaTech,383nlu,nasty_nate,3,Mon Jun 1 17:56:36 2015 UTC,"I am a fraternity man going into my senior. I rushed my freshman year in the spring and as it stands right now, the only regret that I have for not rushing in the fall is that in the end I would've had seven semesters in my brotherhood instead of eight. Rush is pretty daunting for a rushee if you take it seriously unless you already know where you want to go (I'd really avoid picking places if you're an incoming freshman), but in my opinion, it makes settling on the right place a better experience. If you rush in the fall, make sure you're mature and ready enough to make that commitment. Some fraternities are a joke and don't care about much, which makes the commitment a lot easier and doesn't require you to be as ready, whereas others really care about their bonds so you'd have to be ready for them from the get-go. If you fit into either of those categories, I'd say go ahead and rush in the fall. If you think you'll need time to gather your bearings on your own, then I'd say wait to pledge in the spring. Why I say pledge is that if you are interested in Greek Life, then you should try to immerse yourself in it as much as possible even if you're not ready to commit. It's also a personal philosophy of mine to never close doors on yourself and to never have the door closed on you. It's my fraternity's belief that you should commit to a life of excellence and you can't do that if you're shooting yourself in the foot. Feel free to message me if you want to know my affiliation or o.   TL;DR - Rush in the fall and rush freely. Don't bother with opinions other than your own. After you rush, make your decision whether you'll commit in the fall, spring, or never."
VirginiaTech,383nlu,mrafrkn,5,Tue Jun 2 20:27:39 2015 UTC,I'd recommend rushing in spring if you want to rush as a freshman.  Use the fall to get a feel for life at Tech and a feel for who you are without your parents always around.  You'll make friends in your first year that may want to rush too and you might even make friends that are in fraternities which would give you a better feel for that particular fraternity.  Good luck.
VirginiaTech,383nlu,skanetic,3,Mon Jun 1 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"Fraternity man here, just graduated this past spring!  Judging from your username OP, I'm assuming you're an incoming freshman.  The decision of whether or not you want to rush a fraternity in the fall or spring is up to you, and just because you rush somewhere doesn't mean you are attached to that place.  Once rush is over, you'll get a bid from the fraternities that want you to join.  You'll pick your favorite, and become a pledge.  Some fraternities will give you your bid, but allow you to defer to the next semester to accept.  This means that once rush is over, you can wait an entire semester before deciding whether pledging that place is a good idea.  I myself rushed in the spring semester of my sophomore year, but pledged in the fall of my junior year.  Did I miss out on a lot of stuff by waiting to join so late?  Sure.  But that was the best decision for me.  OP, make sure you make the best decision for YOURSELF.  Don't fall into the trap that bigger=better necessarily.  There are some fraternities that have 80+ active brothers, and some that are <40 (like the one I was in).  When you rush make sure to attend events hosted by different fraternities.  That way you can meet as many different people as possible, see which people you like the most, and decide which fraternity is the best fit for you."
VirginiaTech,383nlu,antw205,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:33:49 2015 UTC,"There's no harm in going to rush events in the fall.  Experiencing rush and joining a fraternity are two different things.  There's like 29 fraternities, and you can't see all of them in two weeks.  It'll be a good experience to learn the process, learn what you like and don't like, to figure out what you're looking for in brothers, and to decide on the 'style' of fraternity you want to be in (because 'best' is subjective, and 'big' can make it harder to actually connect with people).  Some fraternities host open events during the semester and will send out emails through Greek Life to those that registered to be bid eligible but are not currently in a fraternity.  You can also contact most fraternities before rush starts and let them know you're interested and see how willing they are to get to know you outside of rush.  Then there's just plain making friends that are already Greek around campus and getting to know the fraternities through them.  Personally, I think events and activities outside of official rush are the most revealing and valuable, as guys aren't as hard pressed to sell you on their fraternity.  I went through rush three times before I found where I wanted to be as a group, but I still made good individual friends in the process."
VirginiaTech,383nlu,icee54,-1,Tue Jun 2 09:02:19 2015 UTC,"Dont just rush because you want too.  Rush because you like the organization.  Im in a fraternity right now (actually living in the house at this moment) and I just really liked the guys.  I rushed my junior year, but had been hanging around and knew basically everyone before I rushed.  Just make sure you like the people and what they stand for before you pick a fraternity for life.    Rush in the spring, seriously.  Some fraternities will have the biggest and best house parties, which will seem the best right away, and then you end up not enjoying the actual organization.  I have seen it happen multiple times inside my own fraternity and from outsiders.  Some fraternities are only fraternities in name and dont actually do anything.  Some are into harder drugs, and some are religious/cultural. Some are really into outdoor activities like hunting and fishing along with most members being from the country and some fraternities are mostly northerners.  Find what interests you and where you feel comfortable.  Unless you are dead-set on being a legacy pledge, dont pick a fraternity before you experience multiple fraternities."

Firstly, you may need to enable pop on the vt email account. Log into the VT account, go to settings, tab to Forwarding and POP/IMAP, then chose enable pop for all mail or from now on depending on what you want.  Now log into gmail and go into Settings then the Accounts and Imports tab, in the section ""Check mail from other accounts (using POP3)"" click add a POP3 mail account you own.  I believe the settings you would need to use are: POP3 Host: pop.gmail.com  POP3 Port: 995  TLS Protocol: ON  POP3 Username: pid@vt.edu  POP3 Password: <password>"

VirginiaTech,37yplb,jorgewisconsin,5,Tue Jun 2 00:00:51 2015 UTC,"The POP3 method to pull messages is the way I use it as well. However, if you have time sensitive emails being sent through your @vt account be cautious because gmail fetching is not instantaneous (or even every five minutes). I've had some emails delayed up to an hour before receiving them in my gmail account. As an FYI, the interval at which emails are pulled via POP3 is a function of the number of emails you receive in your @vt account. If you receive a lot through out the day, say every five to ten minutes, then the interval time for fetching will decrease.  Edit: I also tag all emails coming in with a VT label that is burnt orange. And I set up gmail such that when I reply to an email sent to my @vt account, it uses my @vt account as the sender."

I still have my Fujitsu T901 from my freshman year and I still use mine for all my in class notes but it's really starting to see the wear and tear after 4 years of heavy use.  Buy a computer that will last as long as possible and is able to handle Solidworks, matlab, inventor, mathematics, and what ever other engineering software it can.  For your senior design, you may want to do your own simulations so Autodesk CFD 360 would be perfect since it uses the cloud.  There's other software obviously that uses your computer to solve the simulations but hopefully you get the idea.

That's only tangentially related, but is at least part of the overall change that has been happening in B-burg, that will apparently only be accelerating.  This is tricky business ... VT stands to lose some of what has made it VT, IMHO.  One of the draws of VT is that it is/has been a fairly well encapsulated/walkable campus surrounded by a nice town in a rural area.  The encapsulation is already disintegrating; development that further blurs the lines between Bburg and Cburg and makes it like NOVA in SWVA will be sad...."

Town infrastructure was not built to be this big and the governance has not been planning development well. For example Town Council seems to make development decisions very haphazardly. This will become a major issue for the university if people who earn wage positions (not F/S) simply cannot afford to work there.  For example, parking. This is a bitch for students, sure, but it gets worse. F/S and wage have been told directly that their parking costs are going to rise majorly, more than double, over the next few years in order to build parking garages. If you cannot afford to live in Bburg town limits, you literally HAVE to drive as the public transit system really only extends to student-living areas (Cburg service is getting better though, I will absolutely admit). Right now the rate is $260/year. If you're paying $520/year or more to work at your already minimum wage job, that's 3% of your income right there (assuming $8/hr 40 hr workweek). Have a kid? Childcare is not only insanely expensive in Blacksburg, it is actually incredibly hard to find a spot at a daycare.  At what point does it become unsustainable?

VirginiaTech,37whtb,pat_n_hall,4,Mon Jun 1 05:32:32 2015 UTC,"Town infrastructure was not built to be this big and the governance has not been planning development well. For example Town Council seems to make development decisions very haphazardly.   Some people haven't figured out what Blacksburg wants to be when it grows up. Add to that a major disconnect with the Montgomery County Board of Supervisors, who have members who can't see beyond their own district (Fact: at a public discussion about the school budget a couple of years ago, the supervisor from Shawsville/Elliston stood up and said while it was nice that everyone in Blacksburg was rich, his constituents couldn't afford a tax increase to fund the schools -- while his district had the two newest schools in the county. People don't believe he has ever been to Blacksburg.). There is still a feeling in parts of the county that it is still a rural utopia like it was in the '40s and '50s when agriculture was a big thing. They don't want to understand that the county has more in common with urban Roanoke County than it does with Floyd and Giles counties, and that there is a need for infrastructure improvements (water and sewer, etc.) and well-funded schools paid for with tax dollars, improvements necessary to attract and accommodate a growing population that can't afford to live in Blacksburg.  Then there is the Town Council, which makes spot decisions on development (even though everyone pretends that they were well-thought-out). Just this spring, a new student utopia development was approved for Prices Fork Road across from Oak Manor, with rent going for $600 and up PER BEDROOM PER MONTH. This is on par with The Edge, which just opened last fall with high rents. At the same time, the town has been working hard to eliminate trailer parks (there is only one left) from inside the town limits while at the same time promoting ""affordable housing"" (with ""affordable"" based on the salary of an assistant professor). The town did approve a project that will take up half of the trailer park and replace it with apartments available only to those whose salary is less than 60% of the region's median (see http://goo.gl/Afky1l). Some are also set aside for those 55 and older. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment will be $703, which seems steep for someone who is making minimum wage or a tad above working as a custodian or facilities job at VT. The feeling is pretty much that town is for students and middle-managment-type jobs while those on the high end can live in the upscale developments in the county around the town (Ellett Valley and on Brush Mountain), while those at the lower of the scale can live in Christiansburg or over in Giles and Pulaski county (Floyd County is becoming more gentrified as time goes on, even though Floydaricians won't admit it).  VT is building some additional housing (mainly the new residence halls on the Upper Quad for the Corps), but it won't be enough to handle the growth that Pres. Sands seems to want (the BOV hasn't weighed in yet). It will be up to the town to take up the slack and rich developers will get richer, to the detriment of the middle-management-types who want to live close to where they work."

Its more expensive than the rest of SW VA because people want to live in Blacksburg/Chrsitiansburg and its still cheaper than places like Roanoke/Salem and Johnson City/Kingsport/Bristol.  Blacksburg is also one of the cheapest places you'll find a major university in the region.

I see you've tried resetting your router, is it a combined cable modem and router or do you have a separate modem? If you've got a separate modem, turn it off and unplug it for a couple minutes and then plug it back in and turn it back on. If you don't have a separate modem, try resetting the router again, but leaving it off for a couple minutes. Doing this may trigger a soft-reset on Comcast's side.

VirginiaTech,37t1va,FluffCPH,2,Sat May 30 03:59:57 2015 UTC,"I work as a student employee at Owens. Wouldn't say it's the best job, but the hours are pretty flexible, the pay's relatively reasonable, and the people that work there are good people. Management's not a pain in the ass either. Some shifts are rougher than others but you get the opportunity to work in multiple shops doing different things (i.e. grilling, making quesadillas, making smoothies, etc.) and if you REALLY don't like working in a shop they'll take that into account when making the schedule.   A little bit more about myself, I'm an Aerospace Engineering major about to start my senior year. I've worked since spring of my sophomore year. Each semester since I've worked about 9.5 hours a week and it fits pretty well with my schedule. Dining services isn't for everyone but if you're interested the above is at least a simple rundown. PM me if you want more details."
VirginiaTech,37t1va,gangagang,2,Sat May 30 04:38:01 2015 UTC,"I second what this person has said. Worked at D2 my freshman year, only quit because I found another job that was better for me. Working in dining isn't bad at all though. The pay is decent enough, plus you get a free meal every shift. Who would say no to free food??"

The Student Calling Center will probably be looking for students in the fall (they just hired for the summer) and they have 1-5PM hours with $10/hr pay.   If you're not too concerned about money, I work for Under The Green Umbrella at the Farmer's Market, which is an ""internship"" with super flexible hours.  It only pays $6/hr though, but you get food from the Market with your ""pay"" on market days.  Link here if you're interested! She's also looking for someone to replace me in the fall since I'll be abroad, and you may be able to increase your pay to $10/hr if you work through a community fellowship for her.   If you're in Chemistry, you may be able to work in the chemistry stockroom, as the manager is only looking for people in Chemistry or science (I used to work there but she wanted more science people ): ) Pay is through the school, $7.50/hr with <40hr/week."

VirginiaTech,37t1va,jammastajayt,-1,Tue Jun 2 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"I was a cook, I ran the back of house for two years.  It gets rough/stressful when its insanely busy, but you work with a bunch of seriously great guys.  I laughed so much and had such a good time working there when we were not getting swamped with orders (which sometimes produced the most hilarious memories).  Some people cant take the rough times, but really they are not that bad.  BWW has really hot girls too, everyone who works there (if you drink and party) are really close.  Some of my good friends still work there, along with a prior girlfriend.  Honestly I will miss that place, it was a good two years of working there.  If you are looking to be a server, unless you have prior experience, a person who will vouch for you who currently is respected there or a fully open schedule (IE: not a student) you probably wont get hired.  For server/support positions its rare we would be under 200 new applicants a month.  If you want the website to apply just ask, its not the BWW website, since this location is franchised."
VirginiaTech,37t1va,bbeatz1,2,Tue Jun 2 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not a student, as I just graduated from another university and moved down here to be with my GF while she finishes up her degree, but I just got hired (well, transfer from my college town) at BWW as a cook and this is extremely refreshing to hear. I worked for a year as a cook in a corporate store and while I enjoyed most of the people I worked with, the environment itself was pretty toxic with a very high turnover rate due to disrespectful, poor management. Just from having an interview with the BOH manager last night, i can tell that this location is going to be a breath of fresh air while I try to get settled into the post-grad life.  I'm glad I looked at this post, the BOH manager seemed pretty sincere when she was saying that it was a great work environment, but I was honestly a little skeptical because of my experience at my previous store. Hearing the same thing from an employee perspective is very, very reassuring."

That women (hesitant to say any form of name) is a great manager, you will respect her and I promise it will go a long way.  Shes awesome and I let her down due to circumstances outside of my own control.  If you cant tell, I do feel bad about how I left BWW.  Only advice is be social, seriously. As you are coming from another BWW you already know that servers are so dumb! ;)  Im sure we will meet one day as my roommate (starting in August) is the most senior bartender at BWW and I was the only WCT for BOH.  You will hear stories about me, Im sure of it."

VirginiaTech,37soub,vtdweller,2,Sat May 30 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, the towing companies are all lower than scum (they rate even lower than Parking Services) and will tow in a heartbeat. A friend got towed this spring and paid the price. He was working for a downtown restaurant and legally was parked in the lot on Jackson St. in a space provided by the restaurant. After the restaurant closed for the night, my friend met up with some friends downtown. When he went to leave for home, his car wasn't in the space, but had been towed away. Despite his argument that he was an employee and in the space provided by the restaurant, he still had to pay $125 to get his car back -- the rationale was that since the restaurant was closed, no one should be parked in that space and he was ripe to be towed. His boss wasn't helpful, so I don't expect he will go back to working there."

If you're single/want to live alone, it's $525 a month with all utilities included. One bedroom, living room, bathroom, and a small half kitchen.   It'll be cheaper if you end up with roommates. University Terrace is where I lived during undergrad and I paid $340.   The big apartment buildings are full of partying undergrads - The Villiage, University Terrace, Terrace View, etc. Not sure what you're like, but I know some apartment complexes will help find you roommates if you want them and don't know anyone"

VirginiaTech,37jfja,gonknet,1 point,Thu May 28 21:06:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, the building just got built.  You will must definitely have your first year engineering classes in there.    Freshman year class are all over the place. Chemistry/Physics and their labs are taken in Hahn, maths in Mcbryde/surge, CLEs are a crapshoot.  Classes aren't really limited to department buildings until junior year when all you take is major classes.  Goodwin is home to Mechanical and Chemical so its unlikely that you would have classes there after freshman year.  The campus is split into two sections:  The academic side and the residential side with the drillfield in the middle.  And the dorms that are closest to the academic side are CORPS dorms.  A walk to class takes a least ten minutes no matter where you live.  You'd be better off choosing a dorm based on quality and location to gyms or dining halls (Which Cochrane is ideal, hence the athlete dorm).  Note: Don't worry about not knowing stuff.  It took me two weeks to find Hokie Grill when I was a freshman"

VirginiaTech,37jfja,tomEc,1 point,Thu May 28 21:06:16 2015 UTC,"To be honest, as you can see in the map, most of the residential/dining buildings (blue) are across campus from the academic buildings (purple). You're pretty much going to have to walk across campus regardless, unless you somehow end up living in the upper quad. Academic buildings are at most a 10-15 minute walk from pretty much any residence hall, maybe 20 minutes in an extreme case.  First year engineering courses will vary depending on AP credits and such, but looking at the course timetable for the fall, your classes are going to be all over the place. Randolph Hall and the Surge Building are certain for Foundations of Engineering. Math is likely McBryde Hall. Davidson/Hahn for Chemistry or Physics. And many others are possible.  I wouldn't focus on location related to academic buildings, because there isn't going to be much of a difference."

VirginiaTech,37g3y9,polymeowrs,2,Wed May 27 13:41:05 2015 UTC,"In my grad program, Macromolecular Science and Engineering, we basically chose classes the week before classes started. Most people don't worry about course requesting since no grad class is ever too full. You're also allowed to audit classes, say a lower level class you didn't have in undergrad but is relevant to your research interests.  As it gets closer to August you will start getting emails about classes and such. Or email your graduate coordinator and ask."
VirginiaTech,37g3y9,mnowheresville,1 point,Wed May 27 14:23:01 2015 UTC,You should be able to register for classes on Hokie Spa just before the semester starts. Email your department's graduate administrative assistant and/or director of graduate studies for details.
VirginiaTech,37g3y9,Drilz24,0,Wed May 27 17:53:31 2015 UTC,I am not entirely sure to be honest. I am an undergrad going into grad and I picked my classes already. But I don't think that is the norm.
VirginiaTech,37g3y9,AznKwokBoi,1 point,Wed May 27 18:42:03 2015 UTC,"Basically during your orientation you will be choosing your classes. They will already have picked most if not all of your classes for you, the classes that you will probably be required to take. It's basically a time to show you how picking classes will be like, since you'll have to do it all yourself after fall semester. During orientation you'll also be able to move around your classes so you get times that you'd want. If you don't get everything you wanted during orientation don't worry, as drop/add opens again some time in August, for you to finalize your schedule."

VirginiaTech,37it60,threefer,3,Wed May 27 23:08:43 2015 UTC,Too true. 540-961-1150 ask for Danny.
