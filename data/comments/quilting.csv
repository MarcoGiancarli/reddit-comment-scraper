quilting,3e4ejs,sillygirlsarah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:28 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, I will! This thing is never coming off my machine"
quilting,3e4ejs,sillygirlsarah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:58:29 2015 UTC,I'm glad :] seriously. You still have to be careful about your speed with it. Also get thee some clover clips or the barrel of knock offs on amazon at some point and you will never have a slipping seam ever.
quilting,3e4ejs,sillygirlsarah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:10:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't know if it was me, or the walking foot being new, but I already broke two needles. :/"
quilting,3e4ejs,SandyQuilter,2,Tue Jul 21 22:12:35 2015 UTC,"Walking feet require you to sorta adjust how you handle the fabric. You no longer really need to guide the fabric so much as just make sure it's going along your line and aligned right. You might also just take your time and screw around with it on some scrap fabric to adjust to feeding the fabric - honestly, it feeds itself."
quilting,3e4ejs,thatbitchattheIRS,6,Tue Jul 21 22:27:45 2015 UTC,That was so nice of /u/sillygirlsarah to do for you. That's one of the things I love about this sub - we all really seem to care about each other. Yay!
quilting,3e4ejs,thatbitchattheIRS,3,Tue Jul 21 21:41:52 2015 UTC,that's what I said too. I'm still overwhelmed with gratitude

quilting,3e4ejs,sillygirlsarah,2,Wed Jul 22 00:50:02 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity - I've only ever hand quilted, but I'm doing the Harry Potter Project of Doom and I'm daunted by handquilting the whole thing! I want to stitch in the ditch with my machine this time...should I get a walking foot for that? Or do I need something that has free range? All of the lines are straight, no curves, since it's paperpiecing."
quilting,3e4ejs,wesmith294,2,Wed Jul 22 01:51:13 2015 UTC,"also, DUH. so awesome of u/sillygirlsarah! This sub is wonderful :)"
quilting,3e4ejs,holy_shitimdrunk,3,Wed Jul 22 01:51:29 2015 UTC,"Personally, to stitch in the ditch, I eschew the walking foot, as I prefer the maneuverability of the non-walking foot in that situation and to swap out a different foot which you can't with the walking foot, namely I prefer the foot with the clear plate as opposed to the normal feet so I have a clear view of my quilt. So long as you have basted well, you should be fine. This is just IMHO."
quilting,3e3xt5,BOOGEY15,6,Tue Jul 21 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"Easy:  straight lines diagonally through each square, right thru sashing  Harder:  FMQ motifs in each square"
quilting,3e3xt5,andrea_r,3,Tue Jul 21 19:50:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/andrea_r - I would do diagonal lines (making an X) across each block from edge to edge (corner to corner). If you want something a little more interesting, I would suggest a decorative wide zig-zag stitch of some sort, but still do the diagonal lines.  Share when you're done?"
quilting,3e3xt5,SandyQuilter,3,Tue Jul 21 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"Looking for ideas on a quilting design for this. I want to do something other than my go to in the ditch method. I plan to add more borders but that's not important. So my people, any ideas. Also I have small throat space so nothing that will make me throw my machine out the window and burn the house down in frustration."
quilting,3e3xt5,kimwim42,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:35 2015 UTC,Have you considered hand quilting? If you did a simple straight line design it would probably take no more than a month.
quilting,3e3xt5,athennna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:30:35 2015 UTC,I would do diagonals for sure.
quilting,3e3xt5,felixlgato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:31 2015 UTC,I like to go for the unexpected. I think I would test quilt a spiral in a square to see how that would look.
quilting,3e3xt5,lcbug78,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:41:18 2015 UTC,"What about a square within and outside the square? 3/4 "" away from the ditch on each side for example? Mimics the original quilt top design, gives interesting dimension and accentuates the square."
quilting,3e3xt5,craftasaurus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"Some good ideas here. I like felix the cats' suggestion for trying a spiral in one of the squares. Or icbug78's idea of square in a square. Diagonals are a very practical solution too. FMQ is harder for me, I also have a small harp space."

How did the EPP go? I'm also not a big hand sewing fan - other than stitching down my binding and sewing on a label.

I just had a look at South Carolina RxR on FB & a lot of the really cute patterns that would work are more than 3 hours in the opposite direction that you're travelling. I couldn't find pics to show the Greenville SC stores though. What do the patterns you already have look like? Are any of them sea (fish, turtles, sharks etc) themed? If so, I'm interested.  The Asheville Quilt Co. pattern is cute. (I have it already) It's called ""Summer by the Falls"" & has a caravan parked next to the falls with a canoe. Unfortunately, it won't work.

Whales? or fish with a worm on a hook. http://www.judysquiltshop.com/vacuum-world--judys-sewing--judys-row-by-row-experience.htm I can do photos of the others if you want.  I am curious what you have found for pricing. I have only done the five so far. The one you may like was my last stop and I commented it was the cheapest. ($6) They told me that they thought they all had to be that price. I picked up one at The Longarm Network that was $15. I am not picky and will trade for whatever you want to get rid of.

Our house was built in the early 80's when formal living and dining rooms were popular and at the time we bought the house I didn't sew so those rooms are furnished accordingly. Well, we also have a bay window in our small kitchen which us where another table sits. I sew in the kitchen at the table and cut in the dining room at that table. I keep trying to convince my husband to turn the living room into a sewing area and that it'd be perfect for a long arm machine. Those formal rooms are only used during holidays. Well, this Christmas that formal living room will have a longarm in it. Maybe I can convert the dining room to a sewing room to match, they are only separated by an archway."

quilting,3dp0yv,BecandBaby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"I too have the Rubbermaid tubs to hold my fabric. It was annoying until I got the comic backer board idea too. I cut cardboard boxes (well, anything I found sturdy to use) into the shape of the comic backer boards. I wrapped my fabric like a bolt of fabric and placed them back into the tubs. It actually worked out well as they lay on the ""side"" because the tubs are wide enough and deep to place the bolted fabric as such. I'm hoping that makes sense...  A bookshelf would seem ideal. At least to me. But my space is very limited. I'd be met with--""where to put that?"" I am still trying to figure out what to do with my FQ's and charm packs.   Anyways, I don't know if I was much help. But using the tubs I have worked fine to store the newly bolted fabric. Also, a bonus for me is that the tubs have lids. I have kids with sticky fingers running around. They'd be all over my treasured stash in seconds if it was exposed all the time.   I hope and dream that one day, someday, hopefully I'll have a room of my own. A room to call ""my studio!"""

quilting,3djojc,rhapsodyknit,2,Fri Jul 17 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"I was rather trying to suggest this. We get antique quilts in my shop all the time, though none that old. They never have colors that bright and pure. They often have age spots from storage. The best preserved quilt I saw was a silk log cabin from the 1860s (I think, it was at the Houston festival) and it had tiny rot spots. Cotton rots faster and a quilt like that would have been actually used."
quilting,3djojc,thrownormanaway,13,Fri Jul 17 09:56:54 2015 UTC,"I really wish they would keep it out of the open air and light like that. If it's really 160 years old it needs some protections from humidity and temperature changes, as well as from light of course.   Honestly with how good it looks, it seems like it couldn't possibly be that old. The technique, applique, and hand quilting seems spot on though. It just looks extra bright, no spots or tears. I'm suspicious. If this is legit it could pay for a semester at a nice university."

quilting,3djojc,thrownormanaway,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:15:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had the same thought. Recently saw quilts that are that old, and none of them were this bright.

quilting,3djojc,ColonialChicken,3,Thu Jul 16 23:13:58 2015 UTC,"4.00 was a pretty reasonable amount of money for a quilt too, when you consider that female teachers were making about 12.00 a month at the time."
quilting,3djojc,Oatroot,7,Fri Jul 17 02:53:18 2015 UTC,"I suspect that there is some slight confusion on dates at play here. I've seen similar issues in local museums in the southeast, where date attributions are affected by the multi-generational memories of a family. I would be more inclined to believe that the maker of this quilt was born in 1855 if that date has any bearing at all, and created the item in the years after raising a family. Perhaps she worked on it during the early 1900's or 1910's. However, this particular quilt reminds me of similar styles from the 1930's.   Regardless of it's date of manufacture, it is a beautiful piece!"
quilting,3djojc,thrownormanaway,6,Fri Jul 17 07:31:57 2015 UTC,I think you are correct this quilt screams 30s to me. You don't tend to get fuchsias like that until after WW1 and the start of mass synthetic dyeing. It could be more modern then that but I doubt it is any older then that.
quilting,3djojc,Oatroot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:05:01 2015 UTC,"There were lots of bright colors available in the 19th century, actually. I don't think this quilt is that old, but it wouldn't be crazy to have fabric from that supposed time period in those colors. The biggest change in the 20th century was printed cotton fabrics rather than vat dye like they used to do. What makes it seem like they didn't used to do have bright colors is that they degrade so quickly, so no examples really survive that easily."
quilting,3djojc,thrownormanaway,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:43:47 2015 UTC,Yes there was lots of bright colors but some colors where simply not possible to make until synthetic dyes where created. That green and mustard on this where readily available  however that fuchsia is not a color that they would have had access too. That is why I pointed it out. It was not invented until 1860 in France so it is completely impossible for this quilt to be from 1855 that color simply did not exists. Synthetic dye colors where not widely available until post WW1 in the US.
quilting,3djojc,Oatroot,0,Sat Jul 18 13:37:52 2015 UTC,Here are lots of examples of old pink garments that predate your 1860 date.
quilting,3djojc,Oatroot,2,Sat Jul 18 15:32:11 2015 UTC,There is a huge difference in textiles between pink (naturally occurring and dead common) and fuchsia/mauve/magenta (only available in synthetic). If the quilt was pink it would not be an issue. I can get pink out of my garden every season for dyeing from many different sources. What you can't get is the color in this quilt.   http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/the-color-purplish This is about mauve fuchsia was invented in 1860 a few years after mauve.

quilting,3dkbf7,Chupka,2,Thu Jul 16 23:28:32 2015 UTC,"Those scraps look like your binding? Sewing it together would leave you with exposed raw edges around the quilt. If you take those scraps, make sure they will go around the perimeter of the quilt + like 12"" or so. Then iron it in half, trim the batting (squishy middle), & if your quilt is actually quilted (can't tell), then follow this YouTube video for the final binding step. I found it to be the most helpful."
quilting,3dkbf7,vajeanius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:28:45 2015 UTC,Do i have to use the binding? Can I just see the blue pieces together?
quilting,3dkbf7,vajeanius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"If you just see the two blue pieces together, you'll have raw edges that will ravel and look bad. I guess you could flip it all around inside out and sew it all up, leaving a gap to turn it right side out but I haven't heard of people doing that.   I'm not really sure how else to explain. Quilts need binding to sand which around those raw edges."
quilting,3dkbf7,-yvette-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"From the pictures it looks like your quilt is not yet quilted. Depending on the batting the three layers of your quilt need to be stitched together at least every 10-15"" or so. Will you do this by machine or by hand?   After quilting, You don't have to use a binding strip (although the green and blue strips look like they might fit for that), you can also just quilt the three layers together and then trim back everything from FRONT and BATTING beyond 1"" over the final border and then trim back the excess BACKING to 3"" and then flip it over the front, pin it down and stitch it in place. I did that before and it always held up. http://imgur.com/30w0KqN this might give you an idea, though it's not the best picture.   Another tip: from the pictures the top looks quite wrinkly from storage. I'd recommend taking it apart and pressing it again so the top and backing won't have folds in them after quilting. If you don't spray baste use lots and lots and LOTS of pins (Every 5"" or so). Traditional basting with needle & thread will also help the layers not shifting so you won't get folds in your quilt."

I did one baby blanket without any quilting at all, and when it went in the wash (even on delicate), the weight of the wet fabric and batting didn't distribute evenly, and it did a number on a lot of my seams.  The quilt was pieced, which hurt me too, but without the quilting reinforcement, it was a pretty frustrating experience, and I had to do a lot of hand repair.  Good luck!"
quilting,3dezp7,Cut_to_the_Craft,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:54:06 2015 UTC,"I have made something similar in the past. What I did was quilt the front to the batting (with a think piece of muslin under the batting just to save my machine from all that lint). Then when I put the backing on, I simply used my ""button sewing on"" stitch on my machine in a couple of strategic spots ... like the center of the quilt and in a few other areas where it was OK to have the thread on both the front and the back.  Not quilting at all really would make a mess if you are adding batting. As /u/Cut_to_the_Craft says, the weight of the batting vs. the weight of the fabric will give you troubles as soon as the quilt is washed. Being a baby quilt, it will probably be washed a LOT. And batting isn't the most stable (tightly woven) material and needs the stitching to stay together.  Hope this helps!"

quilting,3ddok9,liquidfury,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:58:47 2015 UTC,I'm generally a cotton batting fan.  I like Quilter's Dream Select or Supreme Cotton (depending on fluff) as a general rule but don't mind Warm and Natural/White if that's what I have on hand.  I usually try to buy off the roll when I can to get a better fit for my project as well as avoid as many folds from the batting being stuffed in a tiny bag.  Quilter's Dream Wool also gives a great loft.
quilting,3ddok9,BeBopBanana,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:44:16 2015 UTC,I like 80/20 because it is lighter than 100% cotton and easier to manipulate when quilting.

quilting,3d9b1s,IrisesAndLilacs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:53:01 2015 UTC,"I actually used both. the heat resistant is underneath the top-side of the trivet, so if a hot dish is placed on top of the star, it will protect, and behind the heat resistant there is a layer of regular cotton batting. quite thick!"

Must be different Order than we have here in Ohio, these are gorgeous, but are too colorful for Amish that I am familiar with. They're worth every bit of $1500 avg.  the time and expertise, few can match.  Very few."
quilting,3d7jga,thatbitchattheIRS,5,Tue Jul 14 03:19:37 2015 UTC,Most likely they were made expressly for sale so they used colors that they wouldn't use in a quilt they made for themselves.
quilting,3d7jga,DeathMonkey6969,4,Tue Jul 14 07:39:13 2015 UTC,"i thought of that too- but that's not the case here- I suspect it's an Order that's less rigid, or could even be Mennonite, the public often uses the word Amish to describe them, but having attended a Mennonite church group for severs years, years ago.... They are similar, but VERY different.  And I'm just splitting hairs.   They're B.U.-Tiful and I am always impressed with stitch quality and workmanship."
quilting,3d7jga,thatbitchattheIRS,2,Tue Jul 14 09:25:48 2015 UTC,"There's a thing called New Order(I think) Amish. They're a lot less rigid, allow electricity and I wanna say phones as well, I believe they would use sewing machines and allow for more color variety."

quilting,3d7jga,cocktailbling,3,Tue Jul 14 03:22:39 2015 UTC,"I was in that shop a couple weeks ago.  They are actually going out of business and those are probably the 40% off prices.  Eureka Springs is where we go to celebrate our anniversary, and when we were there in 2014 they were charging $2k-5k for quilts.  I also bought a quilted pillow that the lady assured me was Amish, but after I'd bought it I found a ""made in China"" tag inside the quilted pillow casing.  it's my fault for not looking closely before I bought."

quilting,3d7jga,SilverVixen1928,2,Tue Jul 14 13:23:51 2015 UTC,WHAT?!?!?! that's absolutely terrible. Now I'm wondering if those quilts are even Amish at all.
quilting,3d7jga,Wakesaya,2,Tue Jul 14 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"The Amish quilts I'd always heard about were made of only solid colors. Still, these are very nice and colorful.

quilting,3d7i48,onering,8,Tue Jul 14 03:03:02 2015 UTC,"As someone whose second quilt measured 81"" x 99"" I can tell you that it is very doable.  With that said, I hated working with very small pieces of fabric.  So, I opted to working with 9"" x 9"" blocks (3"" squares) instead of the 6"" x 6"" (2"" squares) blocks of my first project.  Not only was it easier to work on the blocks, but it was really nice and encouraging to see progress being made.    Working on a larger quilt did present problems that working on a smaller one did not.  I currently work at the dining room table in my one bedroom apartment.  So to baste my quilt, I ended up having to move and flip furniture up on end to make enough floor space.  I also experienced issues wrestling with the quilt and my small machine when quilting it.    Emotionally, taking on a such a large quilt as my second project had its ups and downs.  There were times when I absolutely loved it and there were times where I completely regretted it (and it shows if you look through my submission history).  But, I'm so DAMN proud of it with a bit of time removed from it.    Summary:  Doable.  I'd default to working with larger squares.  You will likely run into moments where you may regret even thinking of taking it on, but it will feel super awesome to finish."
quilting,3d7i48,NormanIsMyHero,4,Tue Jul 14 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've made an excel sheet to help me calculate how many squares, etc, so I'll see about plugging in 3"" squares instead.   I think the best thing I have going for me is that I don't need to finish it in a rush."
quilting,3d7i48,beauxbeaux,3,Tue Jul 14 13:53:50 2015 UTC,"I don't personally think it's nothing you can't handle given the fact you've already done a quilt with half square triangles. you got this!! and if you don't, it will be a learning experience. no need to worry if it's too much for you to handle and never do it. So what I'm saying is, JUST DO IT!! :D you'll be fine, and we are here for you to answer any questions, (even the ones you think are really stupid) and help you every step along the way.   Really, this is a great community. everyone is really helpful.  Yes, any ol' place like JoAnn's will have fabric in the shades you're looking for. I have found personally that the brand KONA gives me the least amount of trouble when piecing. It doesn't seem to stretch and skew as much; it holds it's shape pretty well.   Yes, organic lines would look GREAT!!! You've got a somewhat linear pattern, and lines would flow well with that.  You can actually cheat, and make 8 ""half"" square triangles to save time. you'll see why I quoted ""half"" (here)[http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2014/01/how-to-make-half-square-triangles/]."

quilting,3d7i48,renegadebetty,3,Tue Jul 14 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"Doable.  I made a 110x100 quilt out of 2.5 inch squares. It's not perfect--with that many pieces, the tiniest mistake has a ripple effect--but it was a huge confidence boost as a new quilter. It's still the coolest quilt I ever made.   Go for it. You'll regret NOT doing it."

quilting,3d7i48,-yvette-,2,Wed Jul 15 02:04:17 2015 UTC,"I think if you keep your lines clean and straight, and maybe look into getting a project wall type thing to tack up what you have as you go along, you can definitely do it"
quilting,3d7i48,-yvette-,2,Tue Jul 14 04:12:33 2015 UTC,"Good suggestion. And after writing this, I went to finish my binding on my first quilt and it appears I need work on making clean, straight lines. Oh well. That's why I have a seam ripper."
quilting,3d7i48,brandnewsheep,2,Tue Jul 14 13:56:08 2015 UTC,"You can absolutely do it! Just take your time and make sure your seams are consistent. You might consider making some of those squares into rectangles, such as one 8"" x 12"" rectangle instead of six 4"" x 4"" squares. But even if you do it with all squares, you can still absolutely finish the quilt. I personally would probably do the 4"" one rather than the 2.5"" one, but that's just because I am impatient and like instant gratification, and a 4"" one would go faster than the 2.5"" one.   As far as colors, you would easily be able to find your preferred shades if you focused on solids, or tone-on-tone fabrics. Many quilt shops have large sections that are just devoted to solids and ""blenders"" in a rainbow of hues. The other benefit of that is that solids and blenders are usually priced lower than prints."

Fabric used is Heather Ross various lines (prints), Dear Stella Mini Dot (pink coordinate), Anna Maria Horner Field Study (backing, not shown) and Heather Bailey Lottie Da (binding).  This is my favorite quilt of all time and can't wait for it to be chilly so I can use it all the time.  Blogged here."
quilting,3d57f1,jawberwookie,3,Mon Jul 13 16:53:00 2015 UTC,this looks AMAZING.  i have been DYING to use this pattern but I promised myself (and the hubs) that I am on hiatus from getting anything new - how did you find the patterns? Easy/hard for the most part? I am a relative noob at quilting and this pattern seems like it's perfect for trying a ton of new things!! Tell us everything!!
quilting,3d57f1,jawberwookie,4,Mon Jul 13 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of thoughts on the pattern!  So I can only speak for the pattern, not the kit, as I didn't buy the kit.  This is what I bought, and I used the link supplied in that listing to assemble the quilt.  Again, I don't know what the full kit has.  The pattern is very simple: there's one side of each piece of the deck dedicated to each block (48 in total).  That side has a diagram of the block and the cutting dimensions.  The link has the assembly directions (which pieces comprise section A, section B, etc., and how they fit together).    There are no piecing directions.  You need to have a pretty good understanding of how quilt blocks go together, as things are very minimal.  Thankfully there's no ""hard"" piecing--no curves, no y-seams--but there are teeny tiny pieces and lots of angles and points.  In addition, there are no directions on piecing the back, so my back ended up being seamed in four different places to make it big enough.  That was a bit annoying, as I had to move all my living room furniture to lay out my quilt and measure my backing.  Ugh!  Overall, though, I really liked the quilt experience.  I'm a pretty intermediate/advanced quilter but made a decent amount of mistakes here - some points are cut off and some blocks ended up a little off of the measurements.  No matter how I pieced or cut, things didn't change.  So at some point you just accept it for its faults and move on (even if your longarmer scolds you).  I love this quilt.  I love samplers!  Every block was new and fun.  But you need to be comfortable with small piecing, knowing how to press seams (open vs. to a side - there are no directions), how to piece blocks, etc.  It's not for the faint of heart!  But it's so fun!!  Start with the big blocks and work your way down to the 6"" blocks.  Or look through and find the blocks you know you can do - there are some simple designs - and move on from there.  I say go for it and if it doesn't work out right away, put it aside for a while.  It won't go bad!  And now I can give advice on it :)"
quilting,3d57f1,Smellmopwho,2,Mon Jul 13 20:57:14 2015 UTC,Ahh sounds so fun! Which one was your favorite to do?
quilting,3d57f1,Smellmopwho,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:32:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure!  I loved the 6"" blocks - they were the most fun because you could really fussy cut tiny details.  And they didn't take long to make!  I love the block with the bees and the flowers - it was busy but fun and unexpected for what I typically do.  I think working with the fabrics was my favorite part, more than a particular block, because I got to use them in fun, new ways and highlight as many details as I could."

quilting,3d40rk,midnightagenda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:59:04 2015 UTC,"Came to say this, I finished a baby quilt this way. I thought it was kind of cute.

quilting,3d40rk,RainbowAndGlitter,9,Mon Jul 13 20:42:34 2015 UTC,"I like them in. Binding the zigzag is a little difficult for me.  You will have to cut the edge pieces larger or you will lose the points on your hexie. Just cut a hexie in half and your 1/4 seam on the binding will end up right at the point without ""eating"" it Great quilt however you go, OP."
quilting,3d40rk,felixlgato,7,Mon Jul 13 13:30:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the straight edges, but I know there's a camp that prefers the zig zags.  For a baby quilt, straight edges will be easier to keep clean and nice, I think.  It's going to get washed a LOT, so you'll want less trickiness in the binding."
quilting,3d40rk,Marimba_Ani,2,Mon Jul 13 14:20:59 2015 UTC,"If it were me I would use full pieces all around, sewing everything together.  Then using a ruler, I would cut it down so that at there is room for binding and you will keep your points on the full hexies.  Plus this way the cut hexies will be easier to sew in.  Small pieces are difficult, in my opinion. Edit: I forgot one point, I would trim it down so you have 1/2 inch seam allowance  from the point of the full hexies.  This will keep you from losing your points."

She said: ""If your friend (or husband or child) came to you with this problem, what would you advise them to do? Then take that advice for yourself.""  Personally (since you are asking for advice), I say you put no more effort into this friendship OR getting the quilt to her. If she wants it that badly, she will (should) contact you. Let it slide. I wouldn't put it on my own couch just yet --- give it several months and see if she's made ANY effort to contact you. If not, then I'd consider it mine and let her go.

quilting,3d56rj,quiltingismytherapy,6,Tue Jul 14 18:36:34 2015 UTC,I would keep it. It's a hard choice but quilts that are made by friends or family should be treasured. If this friend doesn't treasure your friendship then your dedicated work shouldn't be gifted to them.
quilting,3d56rj,-yvette-,2,Mon Jul 13 18:44:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that was my gut feeling as well, I guess I just needed some reassurance."
quilting,3d56rj,Ashtrashbdash,2,Mon Jul 13 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"I totally understand, I would feel the same way. I know my husband would say the same thing yours did."
quilting,3d56rj,Anne314,3,Mon Jul 13 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"This happened to me, too. I made a baby quilt for a friend of mine and was really excited about it. We were growing apart but i just thought it was because of her pregnancy, things are of course changing when you get pregnant. I tried to keep in touch but it was difficult. However, i gave her the baby quilt when she had her baby. She wasn't really excited about getting it, but again i thought that her new role as a mother just made her blend out everything else. Which would have been ok really. She told me that the baby loved the blanket about a year later at some party, so i was very relieved it was used at all. But we've grown apart completely and had some fights since then. I sometimes think about giving her that quilt. If it wasn't for the little one, I'd be bitter. But I'm glad that she has it. She can't help having my 'friend' as a mother.  Oh, bit more of a rant than I'd thought - I guess the bottom line is: if you think she wouldn't value all your money and your time that has gone into it, don't give it to her. It's a valuable thing, as is your Friendship. If she doesn't want the one thing, she doesn't deserve the other. And that goes either way..."
quilting,3d56rj,thatbitchattheIRS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:40:23 2015 UTC,It's nice to know I'm not the only one who's been in this scenario I guess. I have made up my mind to keep it for myself but I like your point that she doesn't deserve it if she doesn't want to maintain the friendship!
quilting,3d56rj,jbird18005,3,Tue Jul 14 20:42:30 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I realize I am kind of late to the party here, but I had a similar situation and wanted to share.  I had a coworker that I considered a friend get pregnant and I told her I would excitedly love to make her a baby quilt.  I bought beautiful Amy Butler fabric and sketched it out in great detail (I like to give signed/ dated sketches of my quilts with the actual quilt) and talked with her through out her pregnancy about the quilt progress.  She threw herself a baby shower a few days after quitting our workplace and did not invite me.  She DID invite several of our coworkers.  AWKWARD.  Even more awkward is that I STILL work with her sister.  After much guilt, anger and hurt, I decided not to gift her the quilt.  Quilts are gifts I give out of love to people that I love and care about.  People I love and care about treat me with love and respect.  The end.  This quilt has sat in blocks in my closet for nearly a year because I didn't want to think of the situation surrounding it.  Most recently, my boyfriend's grandmother passed away and I remembered those blocks.  It is now a quilt and I am sending it to my boyfriend's mother as a token of my sympathy.  I still have not talked to the girl who had the baby and don't plan on it.  She did me a favor by showing me she didn't deserve something I put so much effort, money and love in to when she couldn't think of me in a fraction of that way.  You deserve a good friend.  Bad friends and people who are self-centered and hurtful do not deserve your time IMHO."

Since you made this with her in mind and as a gift....you're going to ALWAYS think of her when you use it it even catch a glimpse from the corner of your eye.... It will always remind you of ""her"".   Shoot her an email, inviting her to lunch or a movie - something, your side of town, your choice..... If she shows up and mentions it, you gave an option.... But I doubt she will, put it up and when your favorite charity has a fund raiser, donate it.   You can deduct your materials, not your time on your 1040!!  Good luck and I'm sorry she's been such a bad friend.   I've gotten stuck being that bad friend lately, it's rough and I feel terrible, it's tough medically for me though....

quilting,3d4060,tz67,2,Mon Jul 13 20:51:43 2015 UTC,"My concern would be how the different fabrics will feed through the machine.  Before doing it for the whole quilt, I would make a tester block first.  Or maybe even a long strip with a top fabric, batting, then the duck cloth.  But it seems like if you use a walking foot with your feed dogs down, everything should sew smoothly.  If I were to guess, it will probably effect the water resistance to a point. But it will still be better than a regular quilter's cotton.  Let us know how it turns out!  :)"

quilting,3d4060,mimosa22,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:42:41 2015 UTC,"I am almost embarrassed to ask this, as I have actually made several quilts. I have always used the ""stitch in the ditch"" method of quilting, where I sew along the seam lines in the quilt top. I understand how to do free-motion quilting in theory (how to set-up the machine, etc.), but am wondering if there are patterns I can follow to sew along. I have looked for templates that I could trace onto the quilt top, but can't seem to find many out there. How do you guys mark your quilts for free-motion quilting? Is there a place/website I can find templates for this? Or, do you guys literally do it free-motion, with no guides? Thanks!"
quilting,3d4060,Katara5,2,Tue Jul 14 23:33:00 2015 UTC,"I use a quilting motif book (something along the lines of this ). Find a motif that you like, trace the pattern onto tissue paper and lightly spray baste it and stick it on the quilt where you want it to go. Then follow the lines. You can rip off the tissue paper and go in with tweezers to clean it up.   This is a good method for smaller motifs, or small areas in general. Otherwise bigger and more complicated motifs are better off done by a programmed long arm, but that's my own personal belief. You could probably achieve the same results on your own as well.  Bright side is cheap tissue paper does the job great."

It's been sitting in our basement relatively unused for the past 15 or so years. I really would like to try quilting and sewing and talked to my mom and she says if she's going to pay $90 for a tuneup she might as well buy a new machine. I know the FAQ says 1970's and earlier are good machines, but like I said this is a 1980's model and I can get something like this (originally $450, now $140) for only $50 more than a tune up. Is it worth it?"
quilting,3d4060,jawberwookie,2,Fri Jul 17 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm talk to someone at your local quilt store maybe? Explain to them what you will use it for and usually i find they are pretty honest whether it will be worth it to tune up the old one. If the newer one you are looking at has a ton more features than your old one and the one needing the tune-up has no real sentimental value, i'd say spend the few extra dollars and make your own memories! A good machine is usually worth it - my parents bought me a really nice basic one for about $100 and it still works great 7 years later.

Amazon has a tendency to overstate their list prices, the most they've sold it for is $200 and the average is $150.  Now that doesn't mean it isn't a good machine or not worth getting or anything. But for me sometimes I have a tendency to get swayed by how good of a deal it seems. (You can check that sort of thing at camelcamelcamel.com)"
quilting,3d4060,spermface,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:20:06 2015 UTC,I really did google and I did look in the FAQ but I still haven't seen a clear description of some sewing machine parts...what is a walking foot (is it the metal plate at the bottom where the needle dips through?) and why is it so useful? Is a long-arm machine a machine with a very big throat or something else?
quilting,3d4060,Katara5,2,Fri Jul 17 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"First off, there are different kind of feet- such as ones for attaching zippers as an example. A walking foot allows layers of fabric to be fed evenly though a machine so that there is less/no puckering on one side or another. I can google ""walking foot"" and come up with lots of pictures of some. this looks like a good explanation of one. (I don't ACTUALLY have a walking foot, so I could be wrong about all of this).   As for a longarm... it's a machine that is attached to a ""table"" where you can pin your quilt. The actual machine is movable, allowing you to have a much greater area to quilt in. So technically yes, it does have a big throat but it's a bigger monster than most people can house (or afford). This is a good picture of what a long arm can/does look like."
quilting,3d4060,spermface,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, okay so the whole rig is the foot? I was thinking it was just the metal plate near the bottom.   That machine looks amazing, I understand people referencing sending their quilts out to someone who long-arms them now."
quilting,3d4060,Katara5,2,Fri Jul 17 23:10:44 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the whole rig as in the picture, then yes. The plate near the bottom does have a name, I'm sure but it doesn't come to mind quickly.   And yes, long arms are a god send for quilting, especially free-motion. They tend to run in the thousands of dollars and the shortest table is 8 feet (I think). They are wonderful machines and they can also be computerized."
quilting,3d4060,jawberwookie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"Wait, there seems to be a little confusion here (maybe its mine?) but it looks like you are talking about two separate things.   A walking foot is a separate attachment that you buy separately from your machine and looks like this:    http://imgs.inkfrog.com/pix/arbeza/walking-foot-low-shank-top-and-front-load-015.jpg  It can be used on any type of machine and is usually about $20 alone, or you can buy it in a set with a series of other sewing feet to attach to your machine for quilting.   /u/katara5 is talking about a long arm machine, which is a totally different animal and has nothing to do with a regular walking foot other than they both are used for the actual quilting portion of the quilt, not a machine part?"
quilting,3d4060,Katara5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"Two different questions, answered both :)"
quilting,3d4060,spermface,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:16:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was just asking two questions close together. Thank you for your answer and link though!"
quilting,3d4060,Drpepperholik,2,Sat Jul 18 15:33:41 2015 UTC,"Sewing machines have attachments called feet that perform different specialized tasks. The feet attach to the shank, that's the part that sticks down behind where the needle goes. The metal plate at the bottom is called the throat plate and doesn't get changed out ever.   As the other response suggested a walking foot is useful when quilting because it works in conjunction with the feed dogs (teeth looking bits encircled by the throat plate) to move bulky fabrics through the machine. Walking feet have plastic feed dog like teeth that ""bite"" the fabric from the top in time with the feed dogs underneath the fabric. Without them a quilt sandwich is hard to move through the machine and can get puckered.  A longarm machine is just that, a machine with a long arm. The arm of the machine is from the vertical piece to the end, it is the piece that creates the throat space along with the base. Longarm machines have a throat space of at least 18"" and while some can be small they are mainly associated with using on a frame in a standing position to quilt the quilt."

Have to get stuff done first! :P  Also, I found it amusing that rather than saying 'imperial and metric', they said 'US and metric'. I guess as an Aussie who only uses imperial for quilting I appreciate the acknowledgment :D"

quilting,3d1zi1,lcbug78,3,Sun Jul 12 21:44:27 2015 UTC,"It looks fantastic! As for the sashing, I wouldn't worry about it. But then again, I usually do stitch in the ditch around each block, creating little mini squares in the intersections. I might do a wide zig zag in the borders though. Just to be sure it's secure. And yes, I think SitD is harder to do when you're free motioning. I use my walking foot for stability and can get it a little more straight when I do it that way."
quilting,3d1zi1,SandyQuilter,2,Sun Jul 12 23:36:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! I appreciate that you took the time. I like the idea for the border I agree it seems loose.
quilting,3d1zi1,vajeanius,3,Mon Jul 13 00:07:18 2015 UTC,Did you have any issues with loops or eyelashes when you started FMQ? I tried for the first time last week and about halfway through I had eyelashes on the top. I've read where you can get em on the back because of the speed of your hands vs. The machine speed. Not sure if the same applies for on the front.
quilting,3d1zi1,andrea_r,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"No, i didnt' have any issues, but i've read that it's a tension issue, too, and that sometimes you have to adjust the tension of the top or bottom thread to correct it.  I'm certainly no expert (not yet, anyways~)"
quilting,3d1zi1,tz67,2,Mon Jul 13 21:42:48 2015 UTC,"Biggest question: should I quilt the sashing? I don't want to take away from the blocks, each of which has stitch in the ditch around it.  Also: I'm horrible at actual stitch in the ditch. Is it because i tried to do it free motion? Thoughts? Tricks? Tips?"

And you don't have to account for seam allowances; you can just put them edge to edge, and send the needle's path straight down between the two, with the zig zag stitch catching each side. I usually set my stitch length to the longest setting, with the biggest zig zag possible. makes the process faster, and you really don't need a lot to hold the batting together."

quilting,3ctduz,holy_shitimdrunk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:33:28 2015 UTC,I can never get mine to line up very easily. And sometimes I sew the wrong sides together so they open wrong.

quilting,3cqhiv,SandyQuilter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:01:44 2015 UTC,"I second the sorted list. Though mine is less a list as it is bins.

I ""just"" need to open them up, re-read the instructions, and get going on them! Everything is pretty much cut and stuff already.

Tell us about your struggle.  I've been a quilter for about a year and a half. I can't quit. It's just so hard to walk by a fabric store and not check out the goods.

It's fun and you feel like part of a community."
quilting,3cs6ui,-cc0unt-nt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:25:07 2015 UTC,"Holy moly, I just took a look at that Craftsy block of the month. Is that quilt insanely technical? Or am I more of a beginner than I thought?"
quilting,3cs6ui,Grymalcyn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:23:38 2015 UTC,"I think the reason it looks so technical is that it's all stars. Patchwork stars, generally speaking, tend to utilize more in the way of diamond shapes, sixty degree angles, partial seams, etc...   I personally wouldn't consider this extremely difficult, but in reviewing the first couple of class lessons, there's an emphasis on precision piecing and the inclusion of diamonds in quilting. I also notice that this seems to be be intended for newer quilters, as the first lessons go through washing, pressing, and pre-cutting."
quilting,3cr26q,lengthynewt,5,Fri Jul 10 02:20:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, I've played that game!   How do you finish a quilt in a day? First, procrastinate until you have one day left. Then call a buddy over, have a panic attack, and get 'er done."
quilting,3cr26q,ktigger2,3,Fri Jul 10 11:38:09 2015 UTC,So I finished a quilt today that I don't need to hand over to the recipients until the 18th. Usually I'm the type to finish literally right before having to walk out the door. It feels great!
quilting,3cr26q,JuliaDD,2,Fri Jul 10 02:21:09 2015 UTC,Were you in a quilting competition?  I don't understand...
quilting,3cr26q,JuliaDD,2,Fri Jul 10 02:52:14 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, I should have explained better. It made sense in my head! My brother and sister-in-law are having a baby next month, and the baby shower is the 18th. I made a baby quilt and finished tonight, which is wayyyyyy earlier than I normally finish things."
quilting,3cr26q,-cc0unt-nt,2,Fri Jul 10 02:53:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, good for you!  Congrats!"
quilting,3cr26q,SandyQuilter,2,Fri Jul 10 02:56:43 2015 UTC,Been their done that way too many times! I've got a baby quilt that's been on display in my house for a month now and the shower isn't until August. Woo! I like finishing them early so I can ogle them longer.
quilting,3cr26q,gorramquilts,2,Fri Jul 10 12:55:25 2015 UTC,Yay! LOVE being able to do that. Savor the accomplishment for sure!

He is a long hair shelter kitty but we had to get him shaved in the lion cut because his fur was starting to mat from a diet change. He went from great quality Blue Buffalo food to crappy prescription Hill's Science Diet. Poor guy, he has to stay on that food forever. I will just have to brush him like crazy. I have 2 heavy shedders, the kitty and a German Shepherd rescue.  Before lion cut"

My current one was there for 6 weeks before we went and found her. I apologize to her all the time for taking so long to get her and thank her for waiting for us!  I also support German Shepherd Rescue of Orange County, so your comment about your doggie struck several of my heart strings. I think you are a WONDERFUL person!"
quilting,3cq7y2,SandyQuilter,4,Thu Jul 9 23:47:18 2015 UTC,"He's a stinker! We got him in May of 2009 and he was born 2/6/09.   I volunteer with German Shepherd Rescue and Adoptions, they're based in NC and I'm in SC. I adopted my sweet girl from them in 2010. Here is my Shiva girl.

quilting,3cow8l,measuredandslow,2,Thu Jul 9 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"I designed this for a blog hop I was doing with Diane of CraftyPod - she wrote a new book about paper piecing, and organized each week of the hop into projects using the same shape. My week was apple cores, so this is my design! I have to say, this is one of my favorite things I've made this year. The apple cores are fun to play with (although basting curves is a little hard to get used to) and it turned out so bright and cheerful.   It's also my first attempt at free motion feathers (second photo) and I'm really happy with them! They're super wonky and the sides of each don't really match, but the stitches are pretty even and I've finally figured out the right speed so I don't get eyelashes. I definitely need more practice but I'm pleased :).  The full story, more photos, and info on Diane's book is here: http://measuredandslow.com/2015/07/07/kaleidoscope-wall-hanging-apple-a-deay-blog-hop-and-giveaway/ (I wasn't sure if it was okay to post to her book directly; I absolutely loved it and gave it a rave review :) )"

quilting,3crjq9,beauxbeaux,2,Fri Jul 10 07:39:17 2015 UTC,This or you could make it a twin size to use on the bed now that he could use as a throw for on the couch later. I use a twin size blanket as a couch blanket during the winter time.
quilting,3crjq9,Drpepperholik,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:42:37 2015 UTC,"While it would be a lot of fun to make a queen size, he's more of a comforter-guy. I think twin now/throw later is a good idea too."

As /u/thatbitchattheIRS said, we were all new once ourselves.  Once you get the top done, if you want to make it bigger you can always add borders to it. I wouldn't stress TOO much over the size at this point. (Of course, you don't want to make it too small so it's all border and very little center, but you know what I mean, right?)   Have fun and please post photos! (Oops - that's 3 things)"
quilting,3crjq9,Tziggybean1013,2,Fri Jul 10 15:00:53 2015 UTC,"Would it be like a pixel type picture?  You can go to www.youpatch.com.  you upload your picture, it converts your pic into Kona Solid colors (brand if fabric which has excellent quality cotton and great vibrant color), you can choose your finished square size ie. Pixel size. And you can swap out colors and/or alter your pattern before you order it. It's pretty cool!  Only $9.50 too."
quilting,3crjq9,-yvette-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:42:18 2015 UTC,"I did this once! Already posted it here but here's the Imgur album: http://imgur.com/a/YXkKQ  You can see that I took an already pixelated picture and reproduced it on a notebook, with every block being one square in the quilt. I then counted how many of each colour I'd need and roughly calculated how big I needed to cut them. I didn't have a size in mind, but let the pattern dictate the size. With 2"" squares, it went to finish at about half queen-size as you can see in the picture.  It's relatively easy to something like this for a sprite of a video game character, because they usually come in pixels ;) If you tell us which character it is we might help you further - There's also the Super Mario Quilt Along in this sub where they already have instructions for finished blocks - You'd just need to cut the squares into a bigger size and follow the instructions."

quilting,3co359,Marimba_Ani,3,Thu Jul 9 16:44:46 2015 UTC,I'm the same way.  My quilts are not anything fancy and the bigger ones take 3 - 6 years to finish.  But once they're finished it's still pretty satisfying!
quilting,3co359,crapshack,2,Thu Jul 9 19:05:07 2015 UTC,My son was having a couple of sleep overs at my mom's house since its school holidays so it provided me with uninterrupted time to get some serious sewing done. Otherwise big quilts take me months.

quilting,3co3v5,lcbug78,5,Thu Jul 9 12:26:11 2015 UTC,I've been quilting now for almost a year and a half. But I only finished the quilt tops and then get scared and move onto the next one. This summer I resolved to make myself finish out the quilts. I've been practicing on smaller pieces and it finally hit me that free motion quilting is just the same as my old doodles in school. Now all I can think about are designs and shapes to try out on my quilts. So I started to quilt the baby quilt for my friend who's baby is already four months old. I've had it done for seven months.  Anyways I just had to share that I am so in love with this hobby and so happy that I overcame my fear of finishing the piece out.
quilting,3co3v5,k9sargirl,5,Thu Jul 9 12:30:40 2015 UTC,That's great. I'm still afraid of quilting anything bigger than a table runner. I send them out to be done.
quilting,3co3v5,Siamsa,2,Thu Jul 9 13:46:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I was going to do that, but I know myself.  I knew that I would eventually work up the courage and then kick myself for wasting all those practice opportunities."
quilting,3co3v5,andrea_r,3,Thu Jul 9 22:39:05 2015 UTC,That's so awesome!  I have yet to overcome my own fear of free motion quilting - maybe someday!

quilting,3co3v5,SandyQuilter,3,Thu Jul 9 22:39:57 2015 UTC,Looks pretty good!  The only way to get better at it is to KEEP DOING IT. Those gorgeous pictures of fantastic quilting were after doing literally hundreds.

quilting,3cjvnw,slamberina,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:49:38 2015 UTC,This is the cutest thing ever.  Great job.  I wish I could upvote it more than once.
quilting,3cjlxu,ladybhbeb,2,Wed Jul 8 12:35:52 2015 UTC,That's beautiful. I also really love the fact that you took the time to make sure your stripes were going the same way on the pieces that were side-by-side. That takes a little bit of planning. Good work!
quilting,3cjlxu,quiltr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:10:55 2015 UTC,I originally wasn't going to but then I pieced the first top quarter and realised how terrible the quilt would look if I didn't take the extra time. Fortunately I only had to unpick and swap two squares on the first quarter. The other three quarters were simple as all I had to do was duplicate the first one and rotate the whole quarter into its final position. I'm looking forward to making some progress on the double wedding quilt I have in progress now that I've nearly finished this one and the color block quilt I posted the other day.
quilting,3cjlxu,phyllis_the_cat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:28:05 2015 UTC,That's looks great! I like the color choices.
quilting,3cjlxu,ImaginIllyar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:01:20 2015 UTC,It's very elegant looking.
quilting,3ckcmy,thrownormanaway,10,Wed Jul 8 16:14:25 2015 UTC,Wash on cold with a gentle detergent. Throw a couple of color catchers in there to absorb the excess dye. I believe Shout makes them. It should be fine.
quilting,3ckcmy,teardrop87,2,Wed Jul 8 16:21:56 2015 UTC,"Really? It's that easy?I even read on the Tonga Treats website how bad they run. Why they don't just do the right thing as professional fabric manufacturers and set the dye before sale, I'll never know."
quilting,3ckcmy,teardrop87,4,Wed Jul 8 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yep. I used a couple on my last quilt, and made HST pinwheels with white fabric. I didn't prewash, and just threw a color catcher in with the finished quilt. It came out fine. If you want to pre-wash pre-cuts, tie them into a pillow case."
quilting,3ckcmy,Eublepharis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:31:58 2015 UTC,Thanks!
quilting,3ckcmy,gorramquilts,2,Wed Jul 8 18:16:29 2015 UTC,I wash everything I make on hot to help it shrink and with color catchers I don't have any problems with bold colors staining the whites
quilting,3ckcmy,Eublepharis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:59:57 2015 UTC,"So do I wash and dry before quilting? My last quilt (first quilt ever) I made, nothing was prewashed, and it was quilted before I washed it the first time. I bound it after that but I did the math and it shrunk about 6% batting and all. I guess my concern would be that things would shrink too much or not at all once it was all together."
quilting,3ckcmy,godshomemovies,2,Wed Jul 8 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"Wash after it's quilted, not before! Otherwise you'll get all kinds of fraying craziness. And this way everything shrinks together. Otherwise, your top will be shrunk but the batting and back won't be, and then will shrink."
quilting,3ckcmy,godshomemovies,2,Wed Jul 8 18:12:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking!! Thanks for confirming my suspicions"
quilting,3ckcmy,SandyQuilter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:15:50 2015 UTC,I finish the quilt before I do anything like washing it I haven't had problems with weird shrinkage
quilting,3ckcmy,beep42,2,Wed Jul 8 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"That's what I'd heard to do, just not sure if that was considered the best way to do it or if it was just a common way"
quilting,3ckcmy,gorramquilts,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:17:05 2015 UTC,"It's common to block a quilt by hand washing it before binding it, which is a good way to get something really square or flat, especially if it's heavily quilted or needs to hang square for a show or something.  That said, I haven't had an issue with the quilt shrinking weird by washing it after binding it."
quilting,3ckcmy,Natsukashii,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"When you say that, do you mean that it's hand washed and stretched here and there to get just the right shape then air dried?"
quilting,3ckcmy,gorramquilts,2,Wed Jul 8 19:33:43 2015 UTC,That's pretty much how it works.
quilting,3ckcmy,SandyQuilter,6,Thu Jul 9 04:33:11 2015 UTC,I've used several packages of Tonga Treats and other batik strips. Didn't prewash a single one. Washed them on warm with a color catcher and no problem at all. Don't panic ...
quilting,3ckcmy,tz67,5,Wed Jul 8 17:46:44 2015 UTC,"And here's another thing: just because it runs doesn't mean the dye will attach to the fabric. The rinse water might look awful, but the fabric looks the same. What's coming off is excess dye."
quilting,3ckcmy,renegadebetty,2,Wed Jul 8 18:20:43 2015 UTC,Ooh bravo. Thank you! What product did you use for the color catcher?
quilting,3ckcmy,tz67,4,Wed Jul 8 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"I use Shout Color Catchers - love them. And, yes, throw a bunch in if you're worried. I've heard people say before that they'll throw in a whole box (which I think is overkill)."

quilting,3cgahq,Drpepperholik,2,Tue Jul 7 20:53:09 2015 UTC,I'd love to learn embroidery but I'm afraid I will get impatient and not finish it.
quilting,3cgahq,Drpepperholik,5,Tue Jul 7 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"Pillowcases are a great first project.  You can buy them with the design already stamped on them and they come with a guide (that you can follow or not).  I think the cross-stitch ones are kind of boring since they're the same stitch over and over, but they are good for learning consistency."
quilting,3cgahq,Drpepperholik,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:12:46 2015 UTC,I will have to look into that. I never really thought of doing any embroidery work until I saw a quilt my great grandmother did that she embellished with some  hand embroidery. She also did a Grandmother's Flower Garden which has inspired me to do EPP.
quilting,3cgahq,Drpepperholik,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:49:08 2015 UTC,My grandma did a lot of whole-top quilts with embroidery; I have one with all of the state flowers on it.  EPP looks so interesting!  (I had to look it up.)
quilting,3cgahq,baxterbaddog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:32:31 2015 UTC,I can't figure out how to just link to the one image in the album but if you scroll down to the satin one you'll see the embroidery work that she did that I love and makes me want to do some.  There is an EPP one in the album link as well. I think it looks like a lot of fun and would be a great to go project.

quilting,3ch4dr,didymas,5,Tue Jul 7 21:32:25 2015 UTC,This is the first quilt I have ever made. I am 28 year old male and an engineer so some people are pretty surprised when I told them I was making a quilt. My mom is a big quilter and I learned to sew when I was little but this is the first thing I have sewn in a while (other than mending pants pockets or something small) and the biggest things I have done. My design was inspired by this.
quilting,3ch4dr,Pretty_Kitty_XD,4,Tue Jul 7 21:39:33 2015 UTC,"You know, I could tell just by looking at the quilt that you had to be an engineer. Fantastic job!"
quilting,3ch4dr,DavisDogLady,2,Wed Jul 8 05:53:38 2015 UTC,I love it! I am teaching my nephew to sew and he is (slowly) working on his first quilt. I am going to show him this for inspiration :)
quilting,3ch4dr,-yvette-,4,Wed Jul 8 13:36:31 2015 UTC,Very cool/hot ;) I quite like how you planned everything - Both fabrics are great and the diagonal look of the quilt itself is very cool as well. It worked out great and I'm sure the baby (and the mom) will cherish this quilt forever.
quilting,3ch4dr,-yvette-,2,Tue Jul 7 21:41:05 2015 UTC,"Haha, I just noticed that the sacks of fabric look like little (wedding) dresses with a colour transition of you don't look too close :)"
quilting,3ch4dr,Drpepperholik,2,Tue Jul 7 21:46:48 2015 UTC,"I saw that too. Glad I'm not the only one. I thought to myself, hmm, is he making a dress to match the quilt?"
quilting,3ch4dr,Drpepperholik,3,Wed Jul 8 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"Awesome work! What kind of engineer are you? My dad is an electrical engineer, my husband and I are software engineers. What's it like being a young male quilter? My son is a toddler and I would love for him to be interested in quilting but I don't want him to be picked on for it. He does love whenever I finish a top and I hold it up he'll say ""ooooooo, mommy!!"""
quilting,3ch4dr,Drpepperholik,2,Wed Jul 8 13:06:42 2015 UTC,"I am a Systems Engineer for an AV Integrator. I don't remember being picked for being crafty as a kid. In 10th grade I would crochet scarves and sell them. I even crocheted while in class. (Having something to fiddle with helped me concentrate and my Spanish grade went from a B to an A.) Lots of kids thought it was cool. (""Cool"" might be a strong word.) Now that I am an adult my friends are definitely impressed when I bust out some craft skill they didn't know I had. While sewing and crafting things may be seen as stereotypically girl activities I think most people recognize them as a skill and talent, and people appreciate skills and talents. I have 4 brothers; all of us learned to sew. Only 2 of us really ""do"" anything with it (my brother makes his own camping gear) the others fix ripped pants or put buttons on but that is about it. I would say at least teach your son the basics. If he is interested teach him more. Maybe he keeps doing it maybe he doesn't. I still asked my mom for advice on this project."
quilting,3ch4dr,SandyQuilter,2,Wed Jul 8 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! I was self taught for quilting and the only thing I've ever sewn before has been self drafted Halloween costumes for my husband and me. My mom crochets and I never got into it, I made one scarf and that was it. It is impressive that you have those skills. I'll definitely teach him to hem pants (my husband and I are on the shorter side), sew buttons and do some simple mending. He seems to like the quilts already and loves his that I made for him so maybe he will have an interest in it."

quilting,3chdpz,SandyQuilter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:41:46 2015 UTC,"I'm most comfortable with straight lines too. What if you followed in the ditch on the inside of the sashing lines around each of the blocks. So you'd follow the beige including where each one kind of comes to a point inside each block. Then do a square around the part where the 4 lines of each X meet?  And go around each 4 patch beige diamond, too.  I didn't explain it very well, but if you could see my hands pointing to what I mean, I'm sure it would make a lot more sense."
quilting,3cfq3q,SagebrushID,2,Tue Jul 7 15:43:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's fantastic! The first thing I said was, ""Wow, look at how she made her stitches look like stars."" Then I looked at the photo and that IS what you did. Yay!"
quilting,3cfq3q,SandyQuilter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:55:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yes, the stars were easy-peasy - just zig-zag with the feed dogs down.  After I did the stars, I didn't think it was necessary to do any additional quilting in the upper area."

quilting,3cfq3q,-yvette-,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:54:46 2015 UTC,"I put off doing the top stitching until after I took a free motion class at my local quilt shop.  I was obsessing about the color of thread to use and wasn't even aware of clear monofilament thread until I took the class.  However, I chickened out on the free motion quilting and drew lines with chalk based on the slight color changes in the picture.  I just sewed along the chalk lines with clear monofilament.  And then there were the stars which are just a zig-zag with the feed dogs down."

quilting,3cf6j4,Drpepperholik,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:16:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she must not need the money. That's like the shops downtown here.

I hope I can, but I hope it's something that I want to do. I'm stuck in a career rut and don't see a way out without having oodles of time to devote to developing a portfolio and since I have a toddler even when I lose my job I won't have the time to do that."
quilting,3cf6j4,teardrop87,4,Tue Jul 7 20:46:13 2015 UTC,"That sucks. I hope everything works out soon. I had to replace my iron this month. I had an old cheap one plugged into a power strip with my sewing machine. Well I turned off my maching, but was still ironing my HST blocks. I got distracted by my SO coming home and having to fix dinner, so I accidently left it on. I went to finish 2 days later, and couldn't figure out why it was so hot in my craft room. I freaked out when I realized what I did, and thank goodness I didn't burn the house down. My new iron has an automatic shut off, and I've tested that it works. I'm usually really good about putting the sharps up and turning stuff off, but I messed up this time."
quilting,3cf6j4,-yvette-,3,Tue Jul 7 13:44:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm glad nothing happened! That's one of my biggest fears. I've wanted to invest in a new iron since   a) I've seen some THAT AUTOMATICALLY LIFT THEMSELVES AS SOON AS YOU DON'T PUT PRESSURE ON THEM!!!! Seriously. How cool is that.   And b) since I've made a skirt and pressed it and the iron left a strain right under the pockets.  Whyyyyyy aaah I was just done :( and I don't even know why. I didn't even leave it there for long. Oh well. Think I need some sort of patch now."
quilting,3cf6j4,SandyQuilter,3,Tue Jul 7 14:00:59 2015 UTC,"I've used those ""lift by themselves"" irons in a couple of classes and to be honest, I didn't like them. Whenever I'm doing binding or something else that needs a GOOD crease, I set my iron on the crease, then move my hands down a way to create the next portion of the crease. Then I move my iron down and set it on that new spot and move on. The ones that lift up wouldn't let me do that ... and I rely on my little process! (Especially since my husband has short legs so I have to hem EVERY pair of pants he buys --- and jeans really need a good crease pressed in befor I start to sew.)"

The other shop closes at by 5 four days a week. I would LOVE to buy that shop so bad. Terrible location, cramped quarters, owner has health problems and literally sat there the whole time last time I was in, and poked at fabric bundles on the floor for me to pick up and look at. Yes, really.  I'd wonder how she stays in business but she does custom sewing so I guess between those two it's enough?  My only other vent is I have THREE custom quilts to make for this one guy with very specific needs in terms of fabric and they are boring as hell to sew and a pain in the ass to iron. I did one and tried to beg off the next two, but he has no problems waiting. SIGHS. He did say he had trouble finding someone to do these for him and I can see why...

And I know you know this, but I feel compelled to add ... since you've pressed all your seams open (lucky you...NOT), are you going to use a little bit of a zig zag stitch as you stitch in the ditch?

Instead of marking perfectly straight lines, I just paralleled the seams and eyeballed it. It ends up with some interesting variations - a few curves here and there, some spaces thinner and some wider - and I like the textured, imperfect look.

I bought a layer cake (10"" X 10"" squares) and am almost finished making the blocks out of it.  However, the quilt will be quite small (will probably use it as a foot cover on the guest bed).  I'm realizing it'll take at least two layer cakes to make a queen or king sized quilt.  BTW, love your quilt.  I like that it has so much white between the colors.  It has a relaxing look."

I'm in a rut right now where I'm using a lot of whole collections in quilts, or everything from one designer.  I'm not super confident in my mixing abilities and I just find it easier to start with something that's already coordinated.  I love all collections.  I'm a modern girl so I don't really go for batiks or repros, though I have done some picking and choosing from those.  I love Heather Ross, Bonnie & Camille, Erin Michaels (Uptown was the first line I loved, back in 2007!), Leah Duncan.  Cotton + Steel is fabulous - I find that I pick and choose from their collections and everything works well together, regardless of designer or release date.  I just love fabric and I'm getting to the point where I think as long as you love it, it'll work together well."
quilting,3ceet6,honeycombhive,3,Tue Jul 7 12:55:15 2015 UTC,"I prefer to mix and match. A lot of my fabric comes from recycled clothing, old bedding, and fat quarters when they go on sale. I only splurge on designer brand fabric during December when I get birthday and Christmas money.   When it comes to matching fabrics,  I do carry a swatch into the fabric store. Usually a piece about 5X5. It gets all/most of the pattern, and I can drape it over various bolts to get an idea how they interact. When I need to decide on backing and binding, I'll carry my whole top in."
quilting,3ceet6,teardrop87,3,Tue Jul 7 10:45:49 2015 UTC,I don't really follow any... i have quite some fabrics of tante ema because they've got lovely children's fabric and i used to make many baby blankets when i started quilting. I also like most of moda zen chic. But usually i just go into the store and buy what i like :)   And if i need to match something i go in with some scraps to see if it matches. The girls in the shop are usually super helpful if i need something special :)
quilting,3ceet6,-yvette-,2,Tue Jul 7 11:33:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm a sucker for beautiful fabric. I love Bonnie & Camille and am eagerly awaiting delivery of their newest collection. I also love Bonnie Christine.   I just discovered Camelot Fabrics and promptly fell head over heels in love. Looks like I'll need to squeeze some room on my shelves (and in my budget!)"
quilting,3ceet6,Siamsa,2,Tue Jul 7 14:18:00 2015 UTC,"BOTH! Eventually if you buy enough, something matches something else. I also do a lot of scrap quilts so there doesn't have to be as much matching. I just go for complementary at this point."
quilting,3ceet6,andrea_r,2,Tue Jul 7 14:21:54 2015 UTC,"I'm very traditional, so I don't get into the modern fabrics much. I love Fig Tree fabrics. I also really love most of Mary Koval's fabrics with Windham. Reproductions are my favorites, though, and Judie Rothermel is my favorite there. There's a new company called Penny Rose that's a division of Riley Blake. They are doing some gorgeous reproduction lines and traditional lines.  My all-time favorite line, though, is a line from years ago that Windham did called Sophia. The pictures just do not do this line justice, because the red was this gorgeous, rich red, and the black was a very clear, deep black. If I could convince someone to rerelease a line, it would be this one."
quilting,3ceet6,quiltr,2,Tue Jul 7 15:10:19 2015 UTC,"Love reading this!  As a fabric shop owner, it's great to read buyers thoughts on the subject!  I'm not making quilts any more, but when I did, I was a total ""Scrappy Quilter""...meaning I used any and all fabrics - not necessarily one brand or designer.  I can say, though, that my favorite designer is Kaffe Fassett."
quilting,3ceet6,foxyquilts,2,Tue Jul 7 15:48:56 2015 UTC,"I like the Moda Marbles. They read as solids, but have some depth to them and come in so many colors! And some of them have subtle swirls and stuff, to add interest.  I have also noticed that when I walk into a shop and am drawn to a particular fabric, it tends to be from the Stonehege collection. Don't know off the top of my head who makes it, but I just LOVE the colors and patterns.  I used to work in a LQS and would love when quilters came in with a top or an inspiration fabric. Helping them choose coordinating fabrics really boosted my confidence. Then again, there are times when I buy most of a quilt's worth of fabrics from one collection, then add to it as needed for the pattern.  Bringing a swatch or the whole top (when you need a border or backing) is the only way to travel, in my opinion. There are so many options, shades, and hues that it's hard to know if you got the right thing if you don't have your original fabrics with you."
quilting,3ceet6,SandyQuilter,2,Tue Jul 7 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"My favorite line of all time is probably American Jane's Punctuation.  I once found bolts of it in an LQS; it had been sitting around for years.  Honestly, my fabric tastes are eclectic.  I'll do batiks, wovens, prints, solids, hand-dyes.  I'm a sucker for basics like stripes, checks, and especially dots.  I have a huge collection of African batiks that I'm saving for something amazing.  Christmas fabric... That's a whole new realm!  I try to stay traditional and don't go for the aqua, pink, and lime stuff."
quilting,3ceet6,canquilt,2,Tue Jul 7 15:53:31 2015 UTC,"I like Hoffman batik 1895s and Moda Bella Solids for blenders, and Kaffe Fasset and Tula Pink style prints.  Currently I'm playing with Kaffe's feathers and a couple of Tula Pink's more recent collections.  I LOVED It's a Shore Thing's seagulls from Jack and Lulu.  I will always buy really white on white batiks if I can find them, not the beige or pastel tinted ones.  I'm currently stocked up on bright rainbow batik shades for some Jacqueline de Jong and Judy Niemeyer fun."
quilting,3ceet6,BeBopBanana,2,Tue Jul 7 16:19:23 2015 UTC,"I do both, honestly. I absolutely love Lizzy House's newer lines - the first full collection I got was her Outfoxed line as a gift from my aunt, and I've got a Constellations quilt in the works AND the newer Natural History one sitting in wait. I also really dig Aneela Hoey and have a bunch of her lines, too.   As far as matching fabrics go, I tend to do most of my shopping online and just kind of wing it. When I'm not ordering full lines I will do things like grab scrap packs or the FQ/F8 bundles from Pink Castle Fabrics and just make it up as I go, and I mostly use neutrals as my solids so I don't run into too much issue there."
quilting,3ceet6,Pm_me_some_dessert,2,Tue Jul 7 17:06:04 2015 UTC,"I'm in love with Persimmon by Moda currently.  It is great for home decor type stuff (I'm making placemats and mug rugs out of charm and mini charm packs).  Another favorite is Because of the Brave, also by Moda.  Used it for a gift I posted about in an earlier entry.   I want to get into Cotton+Steel, too, just haven't yet."
quilting,3ceet6,LadyKyo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:01:06 2015 UTC,"I love what Cotton and Steel is doing - curating lines from different designers that have very different aesthetics, but still coordinate really well and can be used together seamlessly (haha) I also love the blenders they've come up with, and a lot of their collections have prints that can be matched up with so many other (non-C&S) collections."
quilting,3ceet6,talesofineptitude,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:12:09 2015 UTC,"I read through this when I find a fabric I love, and am not really excited about the coordinating line.    But sometimes I love love love a line, and it still wouldn't make a great quilt.  Like Kumori Garden because it doesn't have the right color values.  All but one fabric in this line is a light value, so it mushes everything together.  I know personally, because I pieced a top together and wondered why it turned out so blah.  Then I learned about color values.... So when I shop, I make sure I take pictures and turn them to grey tones to make sure my fabrics are going to work well together and not get lost in between each other.  That being said, my favorite lines right now are  Bumble by Tula Pink  All the Trimmings by Micheal Miller  Gypsy Lane by Jane  Elizabeth by Tula Pink  I need to find projects for these!"

quilting,3ccae4,MsRatbag,3,Mon Jul 6 20:09:38 2015 UTC,Closet with glorious amount of batting  Getting a  little trash can today to put next to my cutting table. And theres a big ironing board to the right of the desk but it got cut out of the picture.  I didnt end up doing a design wall (as of yet) but we have a spare bed in the next room that is only used once every 2-3 weeks so for now i can lay out quilts on there. The way i am by the time i lay out a whole quilt itll be done in a day or 2 so no biggie there :)  My SO made the desk for me. It's MDF with a few coats of varnish and sanded with ultra fine sandpaper so its nice and smooth for fabric to slide across easily. He made the cutting table the exact size of my cutting mat and actually glued it down so it wont budge lol
quilting,3ccae4,SandyQuilter,2,Mon Jul 6 20:15:45 2015 UTC,"That is so cool. I also use our guest bed for laying out quilts sometimes. But honestly, if you CAN get a design wall up at some point, I think it just might change your world. Seeing a quilt top design in a vertical display really is different than looking at it on a bed (or the floor).   What does the kitty think of the whole thing?"
quilting,3ccae4,SandyQuilter,2,Mon Jul 6 21:17:47 2015 UTC,oh we dont have the kitty anymore...the kitty went to live with my SO's daughter a few months ago

Because from what I know of you and SO and your relationship, there is mutual appreciation and respect between you two and he's going to do whatever it takes to make you happy. Yay! A chance to save a life (if you're going to rescue --- that's my shameless plug) and add to your family all at the same time!"

But this is for a quilt, right? So you don't want the logo to be too thick (that much interfacing would make it really stiff). I have an idea but it might take me overnight (and some shower thinking) to put it into words. Can you wait for my brain to catch up with my words and fingers?  Someone else might have a good idea too, so if you get a suggestion you like, don't feel that you MUST wait to hear my pearls of wisdom. :-)"

quilting,3cd29n,Drpepperholik,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:01:06 2015 UTC,"Firstly, how are you going to quilt this? Home machine or get it done by a longarmer? I would strip piece the yellow and black bits that are on the white part and then I'd piece that with the white bits, applique the ""B"" on to that then applique that onto the black and then do a bias binding around it and applique that to the background.  I see dresden plates in the white pie slice bits so I'm thinking piece them like that. Just cut them out as pie pieces and sew them to the strip set of the black and yellow.  ETA: I would make the pieced pie with white, yellow and black larger and if it's uneven it doesn't matter then use a compas, or some string with a pencil and pin to get the diameter right then draw from the center your cut line to trim it down to size."
quilting,3cd29n,Drpepperholik,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"I will probably have it done by a longarmer. I had to google a lot of those terms, but I like the idea of making a pie. I think I can do that. Thank you for your help!"

quilting,3cbk3o,SandyQuilter,3,Mon Jul 6 17:11:44 2015 UTC,You can quilt or embroider with pretty colors in the white squares!
quilting,3cbk3o,bklyngrrrl,3,Tue Jul 7 04:15:33 2015 UTC,"Don't panic!  The centre pieces are white. That's good! You can always use them for HSTs or corners or economy blocks where you want to highlight the centre with free motion quilting.   The Flying geese fabric are cut, too. No biggie! Make some. Sew 32 of them (8 of each fabric) and make some potholders (depends on the size of course) or other small projects. Or use the squares to make hsts as well. Add them to your scrapbox. They might come handy sometime! Maybe the problem was just using fabrics you couldn't find another use for :( maybe you have a bright colour that brings them together? Then you could make a border for a crib quilt.   Maybe post pictures? I'm sure it's not so bad :)"
quilting,3cbk3o,-yvette-,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:55:42 2015 UTC,Thanks!! Just posted a pic of all the colors. I love your pot holder idea! I think it made me ao nervous because the measurements are using 8ths and i haven't (in my very short foray into quilting) come across them before and wasting fabric makes me cringe! Not to mention i had no clue what else to use this fabric in :/
quilting,3cbk3o,-yvette-,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:07:16 2015 UTC,"First off: i think the block looks really nice. Even if you don't want to make much more, this is a nice potholder. It's a nice array of colours. I have something like the one that's marbled red/brownish and i love it :)  I don't know your background, but you could also make a little apron with two pockets in front for a little girl. One big pocket would be your block and the other little pocket only flying geese. It's suitable for an apron like this: http://onceuponasewingmachine.com/the-apron-skirt/ (bigger pouches of course).   As you've cut all fabric to the same size, making half square triangles with them should be no problem. You could mix the colours or cut more of the white to make all kinds of patterns with it.   To be honest: I'd still try to make some flying geese, but where the colours frame the white fabric, kind of inverted. I think it'll be fun to play with both kinds, You'll get a nice variation in there. YOU COULD MAKE DIAMONDS. Only if you'll ever make them again of course! ;)  Ps: i tried to Google 'flying geese inverted' to see if i could get some pictures of what i meant. Did not find patterns. Was not disappointed though."

I am basically a super beginner with sewing, but I have a cute little niece I may actually need to try this for :)   Googling inverted flying geese now! some interesting images...   Thanks so much! I think hsts are going to be the way to go for the other squares, and i have a few flying geese blocks that are already like halfway done, so i'll play around! Diamonds are something I hadn't even thought of, i'll check it out when i get home!!"

In between searching for jobs and phone interviews and some in person interviews, instead of fretting about my undesirable situation or doing drugs/binge drinking with everyone I went to high school with.... I can make beautiful things.   All my time and effort can produce something so beautiful (although imperfect). After spending the past 4.5 years of my life studying and writing about philosophy & religious studies, it's nice to produce something I can see and feel!

quilting,3cac1d,Drpepperholik,3,Tue Jul 7 05:38:19 2015 UTC,"I lost my job a couple of years ago so I was home all the time with my then 6 month old. After about 4 or 5 months into it I was getting very bored. I don't remember exactly how it happened but I got the idea to make a Super Mario quilt. I think Pinterest was involved. Next thing I know I'm at JoAnn's looking at quilt patterns when my mom spots a penguin pattern. I love penguins! It was cute, seemed easy and was crib size so I decided to make it for my son. I found that I enjoyed the process and it re-kindled my creative flame. I'm quite the crafty sort but I tend to get bored easily. For some reason, quilting is different.  A year and a half later and I still haven't made the Super Mario quilt that I set out to make. Actually, come to think of it, I haven't even made a quilt for myself. At least my son has his penguin quilt, a large twin size quilt for later, my mom got a quilt for Christmas, 2 babies got quilts, my sister will be getting a king sized wedding present and my Godmother will be getting a Christmas throw for her favorite season. I might be a bit too generous.  I don't think any of this has really answered your question directly. I enjoy the process (except cutting, I need a taller table) of sewing and ironing all the little pieces. Then there's the quilting, oh the quilting. I absolutely love quilting on the longarm machine, it's not mine but I rent at the local shop. That's a very zen like moment."
quilting,3cac1d,cjbmonster,3,Tue Jul 7 13:31:22 2015 UTC,"I've always been crafty but I discovered quilting a little over a year ago and I'm in love.  I really like that the things are functional and useful (unlike some of my previous art projects) and that I can work on it from home (instead of paying to be a member of a studio like when I did ceramics).   I also really enjoy how satisfying each of the steps are. After completing a block you aren't done in any way yet, but you already have something concrete to show for your work and that propels me to keep working on it and eventually finish (which is more than I can say for most of my knitting projects)."
quilting,3cac1d,Pm_me_some_dessert,3,Tue Jul 7 13:55:43 2015 UTC,"I took up quilting because after many years at a paperwork job (same rotation of paperwork every month, every year, nothing tangible gained/produced from my job) I wanted something where I created something physical for my labors.

quilting,3cac1d,NormanIsMyHero,2,Wed Jul 8 13:52:03 2015 UTC,"I picked up quilting because I wanted a creative outlet that resulted in a very functional product.  It's also one of those crafts where I can easily see how much better I've gotten and how much more I can learn yet.  There are always new techniques to learn and master, yet it is definitely a craft where you can put your own twist on things and say to hell with all of the ""established rules"".  And like others have alluded to, there is a point where you just get in the zone, totally immersed in what you are doing.  And then after a good long while, you can step back and see concrete progress made. I like that."
quilting,3cac1d,tz67,2,Tue Jul 7 14:27:40 2015 UTC,"I started 10 years ago because I had recently become disabled and needed something to take up my time.  When I quilt, I am in my happy place.  I created a fun environment to work in.  My favorite part is the piecing of the quilt.  I love buying beautiful fabrics, rolling out that jelly roll for the first time.  Quilting frees my mind and I lose hours and hours in my sewing room.    The other thing I love about quilting is that I can put it down for weeks or months, but when I start up again, it's a breeze to pick it up and keep going where I left off. TLDR:  Quilting keeps me sane :)"
quilting,3cac1d,honeycombhive,2,Tue Jul 7 14:41:42 2015 UTC,I like the creative outlet (working an office job 50 hours a week doesn't allow for much creativity) (though I do hang mini quilts in my office) and I like knowing that something I made is making my house a home.  I love seeing my pets and my husband curled up with my quilts.  It just makes things so much more personal.

My mom used to quilt late into the night (she was a full time nurse) when I was little and I know how amazing it was to sleep under her quilts.   I got back into when my sweetheart was at a cold base in Afghanistan. I wanted to make him something warm and I don't knit. After that I was hooked. It makes me focus and drown out the rest of life's noise.   I love the design process of quilts. I keep graph paper just for sketching out ideas.

My question, probably stupid, but if I want to piece my top together similar to this, can I just piece 3 long columns....with random lengths, same width pieces....and then cut my white fabric to the same length as my 3 finished columns and piece them all together? It seems so simple, I feel like I'm being fooled!"

Very modern."
quilting,3cac1d,lostmindz,2,Tue Jul 7 11:14:04 2015 UTC,"You can do three separate columns, but it would be easier to do one large column. Cut it into 3 equal widths.

I'm worried about how much this could cost on average, like I start to buy things and then realize how fast it's adding up.  How much would you say a typical quilt would cost you in materials, plus I'm starting from scratch, so I have no needles or pins.  I don't own a machine, so I also would like to know if hand quilting is going to be a discouraging way to start or if it's better to start by hand.  I have a little experience with machines, but it's been several years.  Thanks!"
quilting,3cac1d,Eublepharis,3,Tue Jul 7 14:52:32 2015 UTC,Quilting is one of those things where the cost adds up quickly. If you are able to barrow a machine I would suggest a jelly roll race. It's a good introduction to quilting and you don't need to buy a lot of tools because you buy a pre cut jelly roll. As far as hand quilting it's up to you I know I would not quilt if I had to hand quilt because I don't have the patience but lots of people enjoy it.
quilting,3cac1d,sonic_my_screwdriver,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:22:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I'll look up jelly roll race.

In that I sold my mother's 40 year old machine that worked like charm.  I regret that so much. Also, check out people that fix sewing machines and tell them that you need a nice starter machine.  This way you start cheap and if you love it, you can move up to  another machine, like that Brother CS60000i like /u/Pm_me_some_dessert suggested.  That was my number 2 machine.

There are also books on how to get quilting done using basic machines if you wanted to check one of those out of your local library.   Hope this helps!! Welcome to quilting!"
quilting,3cac1d,-yvette-,3,Wed Jul 8 17:28:42 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I'm no expert of this technique but if you want to start out by hand there's a way to do this. It's called 'English Paper Piecing' (EPP) in which you cut a shape out of paper, baste the fabric onto it and sew the sides of your shapes together. This is a great tutorial (the pdf with all explanations is right in the first paragraph, As she says there is no extra page for it).   I've done this with basic hexagon shapes and those look very nice, and I've also recently made a pin cushion using this technique. You can use fabric scraps if you can find any (or somebody gifts you) and besides need only needle, thread, paper, scissors. I'm using paper clips to initially keep the fabric to the template before i baste it, but that's not an absolute must.   You can start out with fairly big templates (I've seen 4"" hexagons) or smaller ones (I personally like 2 cm, as the edges you have to close are neat and small). You could work your way and see if you like it. Granted, it takes way more time than machine-sewing, but you can take it anywhere with you and it's arguably less expensive.   I enjoy making these in the evenings while watching movies. And I've gotten faster very quick.  Also, I've been learning since mom gave me this book as a present. There are easy, intermediate and hard projects in there.  Also, You can print or buy paper shapes and some fabric distributers like moda also have precuts in the right sizes (hexagons at least should be fairly easy to find in the US)."

I'm worried I'm going to make a sloppy mess by doing it by hand, but I don't have a sewing machine right now...  I've been seeing references to using a quilting hoop, is that necessary?"
quilting,3cac1d,-yvette-,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:20:14 2015 UTC,"For the piecing part i can say that the points of your blocks will align way better than when machine sewing, because you have total control with your hands over it. (Mind you, there's also 'paper piecing' where you sew fabrics onto a paper template, and those points and edges are always right in place)  For the actual quilting part (basting a top, filling and back together) you'd need a quilting hoop I'm afraid. But I am not yet that far so i can't give you more info about that. :("

It's surely overwhelming at first, but in any case I'd first see if this is something you want to pursue at all, maybe start off with just a little thing like a pillow case (if you get a sewing machine) or a pin cushion (if you stick with the idea of hand sewing). Still, i agree with all the others above: A sewing machine is a great thing to have!"
quilting,3cac1d,Cut_to_the_Craft,2,Tue Jul 7 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"I do mostly machine quilting, but a fair bit of hand embroidery and a little bit of applique.  JoAnn sometimes has awesome fabric sales (all quilting fabric 40% off, and stuff like that), and I use Warm and Natural batting from Hobby Lobby (sold by the yard, 90"" wide, $12.99 but eligible for the 40% off one cut coupons).  For the more durable stuff, it can add up, but it's relatively easy to spread out the costs over time and buy stuff as you need it (I used a tiny tiny cutting mat for my first few quilts, until my MiL gave me her old one).  I might suggest starting with a smaller project that would allow you to get the feel of the start-to-finish process.  I do a lot of baby quilts (everyone and their sister is having a baby these days), and without a long-arm, working with that size allows me to manage the whole process and get to the happy feeling of being done (slightly) faster. Which is good, because apparently 9 months just flies by.  I've started twin or larger blankets before (i.e. bought all the materials), gotten overwhelmed, and stuck everything in the closet, not (yet) to be heard from again.  Doesn't happen every time, but enough so that I thought I'd mention it.  Have fun!"

quilting,3cac1d,Pm_me_some_dessert,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:21:57 2015 UTC,"A cutting mat is a piece of...rubber? Not sure what they're made of...that you use with a rotary cutter and a fancy ruler in order to cut pieces accurately. If you're doing a quilt that involves cutting you would definitely want one of these.   However, if you are just getting started, you can pick up charm packs (5"" squares) or jelly rolls (2 1/2"" wide by 40-ish"" long) and start with those for simple quilts.

JoAnn's and Michael's also carry them, and I think everywhere you can use a 40% off coupon to get them (and rulers/rotary cutters).  That's one thing that I have found to be wildly worth the money.  Pretty much any blocks that you make by hand you could use for baby quilts.  You just don't have to make as many of them (9 or 12 instead of... more than 9 or 12).  I also think that taking a single block and making it the quilt (like this, sorry for the shameless self promotion: http://www.cuttothecraft.com/index/#/carpenters-block-quilt/) can be really high impact.  All you do is take a block pattern and scale it up (each square of mine was 4"" completed)."

FQ bundles can be anywhere from $40-100, depending on the line and where I purchase it (I try to look for coupons or discounts, which is why I shop at Hawthorne Threads for most fabrics).  Batting can be found on sale at Joann for $10-30, averaging $15 because I usually have a coupon and buy a full-size 100% cotton batting.  I use Aurifil thread which is $9 a spool but will last for several quilts.  Pins, patterns, thread snips--all that fun stuff can typically be found on sale or through Amazon.  You don't have to have the best of the best for your first few quilts - buy what you can afford and use it until you decide quilting is for you.  I still use the Fiskars mat, ruler and rotary cutter my mom bought me when I started quilting and I know the entire set cost her under $25 on Amazon.  Things get a bit pricier when you factor in a sewing machine, iron (though mine was under $30--good ol' Amazon strikes again), and whether you want your quilt professionally quilted or not.

Do you have a machine you would recommend to a beginner? I have read that there are certain things to look for in terms of quilting, but this is all very new and confusing!   I started with a Singer and I don't recommend it for quilting - it was lacking a few essentials.  I know some people started with the low-end Brother or Janome machines and worked their way up from there, but I haven't used those so I can't say for sure.  If you're looking for a quilting machine, try to find something with a walking foot, perhaps a 1/4"" foot, a free-motion/darning foot (for the free-motion designs like stippling or swirls) and drop-able feed dogs.  The feet may be available separately.  Those are my essentials and the other features--decorative stitches, a stitch regulator, a wide throat for large quilts, an extension table--are things I looked for after I knew I was going to stick with quilting.   I was thinking of going to the local quilting store nearby, but since they are a dealer for Bernina machines, I'm worried they're gonna give me a hard sell on some expensive machines.   The hard sell is no fun.  I've encountered it and it's so awkward!  If you can get a good rapport with a dealer--at your LQS, at Joann, wherever--it might be beneficial, though, especially if you aren't sure what you want in a machine.  You can let them know you're just looking, trying things out, and they'll typically let you try the machines so you can see what features you like and what features aren't as essential.  Even trying different dealers and brands would be helpful once you know you want a machine - I have friends who swear by Juki and Janome while I'm a Bernina girl through and through.    I was on my own figuring it out too!  I can't tell you how much time I spent Googling what I found on blogs :)  But this is a great community and we can help you with whatever questions you have!"

I just checked CL ads for my area & there are 4 people selling quilting fabric, 1 ad for notions/supplies & a couple more for sewing machines."

quilting,3cac1d,HornOfDagoth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:51:30 2015 UTC,"I'm nearing the end of a pattern in a book. The materials list said to get 5.5 yards of backing. The backing goes over the edges of the quilt by at least 20 inches both ways!   I also ran into this with my previous quilt, though not as badly.  Is this kind of overestimating of backing common? Why?"
quilting,3cac1d,Drpepperholik,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:18:43 2015 UTC,What are the finished dimensions of the quilt? It is normal to have a larger backing than batting and top. That's for the quilting so as it's quilted it will shrink up some from the stitches and that way you'll have enough room for the quilting shrink up plus a margin that you will have to trim. Generally the recommendation is 4 inches wider from each side for your backing if you're having a longarmer quilt it and just need a couple of inches all around for domestic machine quilting.   Does the backing have to be pieced?
quilting,3cac1d,HornOfDagoth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"I guess the last quilt was standard then - it only had a few inches over each side.   The final dimensions on the pattern are 84x100, though my pieced top is measuring 82x97.   This pattern called for the 5.5 yds to be of 42 in fabric."
quilting,3cac1d,Drpepperholik,2,Wed Jul 8 17:50:19 2015 UTC,"You're going to have to piece the backing, that's why you had to get so much. So it won't end up being 20"" extra on top and on bottom."
quilting,3cac1d,HornOfDagoth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:12:14 2015 UTC,Oh - I see what you mean. I was thinking of piecing meaning blocks and not just cobbling together backing. I did already piece it in that case!
quilting,3cac1d,Drpepperholik,2,Wed Jul 8 18:48:05 2015 UTC,I had to do that with a twin size quilt. I did it a super easy way but for the life of me I can't figure it out right now. Of course I'm at work and don't have any fabric in front of me to hold up and putz with to figure it out. It ended up with the seam going straight down the middle long ways.
quilting,3cac1d,HornOfDagoth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:46:47 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm gonna chalk this one up to just a weird pattern or me forgetting a number somewhere!

I remember my grandmother's aunt making something like this back in the 60s, but stuffed with women's nylon stockings. It was very heavy stuffed in this way. She assembled it on her quilting frame by sewing them on one at a time in rows, by hand. But you could see if a zigzag would work. You could butt the edges together and zigzag them with the widest stitch. Perhaps making rows of say 4wide by however many long, and then join the larger pieces at the end to make it a regular bed size. I have seen quilts called ""biscuit quilts"" that are similar. If you google the images you can see what I am talking about."
quilting,3c3qpt,craftasaurus,2,Sat Jul 4 15:08:41 2015 UTC,"The author mentions that the backing be smooth, in order to make it comfortable to sleep under.  I get from the description that she makes the bags with the raw edges facing in and the stitches together the finished bags with the seam allowances on the top.   That said, /u/peachnyan's link is going to make a much neater project.  Also, I just want to warn you that using scraps like this get crazy heavy. I've made dog beds out of fabric trimmings before and one large enough for my medium sized dogs weighs nearly 35 lbs. I didn't even use denim; just cotton and jersey."

I don't see any raw edges, but it could be just from the back.  I suppose you could put all the seams to one side and then add a backing sheet to cover the seams.  The back sheet could hide the seams and serve as the purpose of taking some of the stress off of the seams holding the pockets together.  I think my biggest worry would be the weight...  Good luck finding a solution that works, and when you do, definitely share it with all of us."

You should have taken a deposit to cover your supplies before starting the project, then collected the remainder of the cost when delivering the piece.   Now that you're stuck with a custom piece it's going to be much harder to sell at full cost to someone else because it's not their custom order so why pay a premium?

quilting,3byitn,wtfbbq247,4,Fri Jul 3 05:18:23 2015 UTC,"I would like it a bit bigger which is why I was thinking of a boarder. So far I was tossing around ideas like color squares matching then fabrics used but having them imbedded (surrounded or encased - hard to explain) in black going on all four sides, or alternating charcoal, greys or black triangles along top and bottom and then doing some other sort of boarder around all four sides. Also unsure what color to back it with."

quilting,3byitn,SandyQuilter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:18:50 2015 UTC,"I would probably do this - I would add multiple borders of as many of your colors as you want.  Keep them the same width as the rectangles in your blocks.  For example, a yellow border, then aqua, then purple.  If the added borders will not make it big enough, add extra rows of blocks before you add the borders. BTW - I love it!"
quilting,3byavo,fawnhollow,2,Fri Jul 3 03:57:28 2015 UTC,"I used a pattern by Art School Dropout and fabrics from the new-ish black and white collection.  I had some major tension issues while quilting, but I think it's pretty cute."
quilting,3byavo,british13,2,Fri Jul 3 03:59:07 2015 UTC,I was wondering if you could explain further how you made this. Was it like paper piecing where you sewed each new piece into the existing and then trimmed? Or was it actually a pattern with asymmetrical shapes to cut out with seam allowances that all fit together?
quilting,3byavo,dadaduck,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:03:51 2015 UTC,Here is the pattern: https://www.etsy.com/listing/170555041/geometric-mountain-range-paper-pieced?ref=shop_home_active_4  It was paper piecing.

Cut your pieces bigger than you need, then trim as you go.  As you improve your skills, you will waste less, but don't sweat that when you are learning.  Also, make a tiny cute thing to impress yourself with when you get frustrated."

quilting,3byzkr,honeycombhive,3,Fri Jul 3 09:11:57 2015 UTC,"I taught myself to paper piece on the last quilt I made.  I was nervous to try but now I love it.  This tutorial helped.  I started off using freezer paper, but ended up using tracing paper (I got a pad of it from an office supply store).  I'd print out the pattern on regular paper, then use a pencil to transfer it to the tracing paper.  It was very easy to work with and tore off easily (use tight stitching).  It'll take a little practice to get the hang of how to cut correctly sized hunks of fabric and account for seam allowances.  Also, you'll get a mirror image, so keep that in mind.  I messed up and had to unpick seams,  but I feel like I have the hang of it now, and I won't hesitate to go to paper piecing when accuracy counts.  Dive in and have fun!"
quilting,3byzkr,Sm00chie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:45:57 2015 UTC,I just watched this video like 3 days ago to figure out what the heck paper piecing was.  It took all the mystery out of it for me.
quilting,3byzkr,teardrop87,2,Fri Jul 3 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"Paper piecing is much easier than quilting (I think) because it's not as exact! I.e you don't need to measure pieces, use a rotary cutter, or line up seams (until you connect larger blocks). Just have fun with it! I too recommend a smaller project (I did an Ebook case made from 1/2 size harry potter blocks from the Project of Doom). Other than that I second everyone else's advice: cut larger pieces, don't forget about mirroring, and don't cry when you inevitably have to rip out seams! Fandom in Stitches has some great patterns if you're into nerdy stuff ;-)"

quilting,3btzo9,Stepfanie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:26:44 2015 UTC,Very neat! My modern guild has a hexagon challenge coming up and I don't know what to do. This looks awesome! Was it hard ? Did you need a special ruler?
quilting,3btzo9,IrisesAndLilacs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:31:27 2015 UTC,"The middle hexagon was an extra from the kaleidoscope quilt. So it was made by cutting my fabric where the pattern restarts until you have six cuts of fabric, then you use pins to make sure the pattern is all lined up, and then you cut it into strips and cut the strips into 60 degree triangles. That leaves you with stacks of six identical triangles that you use to make hexagons. If you search stack-n-whack or kaleidoscope you should find pictures that explain that better. If you just need one middle hexagon I probably wouldn't go through that trouble. The rest of it was easy. Since I already had my center hexagon, it's just a log cabin. You can kind of get a spiral by a shifting your colors over by one side as you go out each row. I also increased the strips by a half inch each row out. For this once I had the size I wanted I squared of the corners rather than continuing with strips.   It really isn't too difficult, I'm just terrible at explaining things. If your ruler has a 60 degree line that's all you need. I have a hex n more ruler, but it isn't necessary unless you want your center to be one sold hex, but I'm sure there are other ways to do that."

quilting,3bs739,thrownormanaway,7,Wed Jul 1 18:46:27 2015 UTC,"OK, now for the details. This quilt is 100% cotton cloth and batting, polyester or cotton thread. Fabrics are mixes of sale fancy fabrics (some Tula Pink, some Moonshine.. Forgot designer that's just the line name, mostly middle range Hobby Lobby or Joann fabrics), and batting is Dream Cotton. For quilting I used Gütterman thread, color no. 22. For the star pattern, I used this picture, and just picked one! I then proceeded to make several hundred 3.5"" ² half square triangles. The wobbly ones are where I figured out that 1/4"" seam allowance really should mean scant 1/4"" seam allowance. Heh. No wonder my finished blocks came out anywhere from 11 3/4"" and 12 1/2"" and generally nowhere near square. That's why I decided to add the sashing. Not only did I think the blocks weren't really pretty laid next to each other on their own, but they really didn't line up at all.  Sashing conceals that and gives the illusion of squares. Several sashing strips are, for example, 2 1/2"" at one end and 3"" at the other, because they needed to allow for some wiggling, and it worked beautifully. For quilting, I just decided to do straight lines in two directions. Went to the store for a walking foot, saw how expensive they were, and walked out with advice on how to machine quilt plainly instead. I think it worked fine. When I pin basted there were some bias edges I didn't account for that had gotten rather stretched on the perimeter and puckered rather severely. Now that the quilt has been washed and dried you can't tell there was ever any issue with puckering at all, what with the softness of the fabric and the crinkling from drying in heat. The quilting required almost exactly 2 spools of the Gütterman thread, by the way. The quilt was 66"" square before washing, now measures 62"" after washing and drying. That's about 6% shrinkage.   This is my first sewing project EVER. I literally had to take a class at my local sewing shop so I could do things like thread my machine, thread a bobbin, etc. I had never machine sewed anything before in my entire life! This was a learning experience for sure.   I truly credit my YouTube quilting education for helping this to not be a f*ckup!! I already knew the rules, so then I was able to just have a small technique learning curve cause I already possessed the knowledge even though I lacked experience. Missouri Star Quilt Co., Fat Quarter Shop, Fons & Porter, Quilty, and The Gourmet Quilter channels on YouTube literally taught me everything I know and everything I used to make this project."

quilting,3bu7vs,Drpepperholik,3,Thu Jul 2 15:05:05 2015 UTC,"Have you considered applique? It wouldn't be anywhere near as hard as piecing.

Then label all the parts with the colors (or color them in with colored pencil if you're so inclined) then use that to trace your applique pieces from. The logo seems like it has good lines so at most you'd just have to do a mitered corner for some pieces of the ""B""."

quilting,3boke4,SandyQuilter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:05:19 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, thank you!  A follow-up question: I've read online that it's VERY IMPORTANT to cut the edges of the quilt straight before applying binding. I don't have any of the long clear rulers or nice cutting boards that I see in these guides, though. I'm guessing that the biggest issue in skipping this step is that the quilt edges will be a little wobbly.  Any thoughts on this? Should I avoid it? Are there ""poor-quilter's"" tricks to getting a straight edge without fancy tools?"
quilting,3boke4,maxnme,3,Wed Jul 1 00:56:00 2015 UTC,I use a metal carpenters (framing) square that I bought at Home Depot.  It was inexpensive and long enough to use as a straight edge.

quilting,3bktyr,honeycombhive,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:38:58 2015 UTC,"It's fusible interfacing that is fusible on both sides.  It has paper on one side so you can trace whatever design you have on the paper side.  You iron it on your fabric then cut out on what you have traced.  I used this method to make the Orioles and the mascot on this quilt:  http://imgur.com/a/OCfFu  After I ironed them on, I used invisible thread (you can use a matching thread), and my blind hem stitch to secure them.  There are other brands out there and they come in a variety of weights.  I use a lightweight ones."

I was having a really hard time with corners, so I just made a bunch of little blankets for my daughters dolls.      I found ironing helped me a bunch when I first started also.

quilting,3bkpr5,nohelicoptersplz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:33:00 2015 UTC,"Binding was my biggest challenge too. As many others have suggested watch Jenny's videos on binding. I did and it helped tremendously! But I was still stumped at starting and ending the strip without having a bunch of measuring, weird twisting or anything so I took to YouTube. I found this video to be incredibly helpful and a super easy foolproof way to start/end binding without any humps, twists or measuring.  The first two quilts I did were machine bound front and back but then I started hand binding and I love it! I used Jenny's video for hand binding to get me started there too. It's really easy and fun to do while you're watching tv, it goes quickly too. Don't discount it."
quilting,3bkpr5,Drpepperholik,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:49:57 2015 UTC,I agree. First several quilts I did machine binding.   Now I hand sew it.  Takes way longer but looks way better

quilting,3bkpr5,cjbmonster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:42:37 2015 UTC,My biggest breakthrough for binding was to do the second step of sewing it down by hand. At first I wanted to do everything by machine because I thought hand sewing was tedious but I actually find that while it's a bit tedious to do it by hand it actually goes a lot faster than ripping out stitches all the time because I'm not pleased with how I did it by machine.

quilting,3bldee,andrea_r,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:37:38 2015 UTC,"I recently redecorated my sewing room and here's what I changed:   High cutting table, just like /u/quiltingismytherapy said.  I think mine hits me just above my waist.  It's also solely used for cutting, so my mat stays put. I hung these Ikea shelves (minus the mirror) above my cutting table and my sewing table.  I bought extra cups so I have all fabric markers in one cup, rotary cutters in another, scissors and snips in another...it helps keep everything organized and at my fingertips. I laid out the room in somewhat of an L-shape: my ironing board forms the leg of the L, with my cutting table and sewing table next to each other and at a right angle to my ironing board.  There's open space in the middle of it all so I'm not tripping over anything and I have space to lay out my blocks if needed.  I previously had a desk that came off of my wall and I was always bumping into it. Shelves!  My sewing room already had a closet full of shelving, as it was a child's bedroom before we moved in, but my dad and husband put in a few more racks to accommodate FQ bundles and pre-cuts.  I have everything organized by designer/manufacturer, so I know where everything is when I need it.  I previously had it organized by color and found that wasn't the most helpful system for me.   Good luck!  Have fun!"

quilting,3bldee,Grymalcyn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:24:50 2015 UTC,"Here are a couple of pictures of my sewing room. We call it the SewOffice because the computer sits on a table to the left of my sewing machine. But it's really MY sewing room - I just let my hubby use it when he needs to.  http://imgur.com/JRGZF4X This is my ironing board with the design wall behind it. When I am using the design wall, I slide the ironing board to the left so it's in front of the closet.  http://imgur.com/9sAB5jH This is the aforementioned (I love that word) closet. Hubby keeps saying he's going to make me some shelves so I can stack no more than 2 bins on top of each other. That will make it easier to get to the stuff in the bottom ones. I have my fabric sort of sorted into categories like ""animals"" and ""family"" and ""girl"" and ""boy."" I need to do another sorting ...   I have a light over the ironing board like the one to the left of the closet because there is just one ceiling fan/light in the room and I got tired of standing in my own shadow. The plastic bag on the left side of the closet is where I put all my ""trash"" as I'm cutting.  http://imgur.com/sxLhWuV My cutting table was one of the best purchases I've ever made. It opens up to about 7 feet long by 35"" wide and when I fold down the other flap, it's less than 12"" long. The wheels make it really easy to move it around so I use it for basting my quilts too. It's about the same height as my ironing board, giving my back a nice rest. I now have my rulers and rotary cutter hanging on the wall under that light. The thread came from a friend who works at a company that recently gave up their shirt embroidery business and told him to ""dispose of"" the thread. So he did, much to my delight! Just to the left of the shelves with the thread is a window.  http://imgur.com/MFYn44L And this is where the magic happens. ;-) There is now a TV monitor above my machine instead of just a blank wall. It's hooked up to the DVR / DVD player in the living room (on the opposite side of that wall) so I can watch stuff while I sew. As I said, my rulers are now on the wall by the cutting table, making it much more convenient. I have patterns and templates in those white binders, but I'm not thrilled with that system so I need to come up with something else. Suggestions are welcome! The sewing table is a piece of MDF with some molding for the edge. We still need to sylicone it into place so I can take off those pieces of blue tape. Because I'm sorta short and because my chair broke in its lowest position, we bought table legs from IKEA and made the table lower than most. My notions are in the plastic container on the table, and larger ones like my basting pins are in those sets of drawers on either side of my chair.   I'd say my biggest loves about my room are: Chair on wheels Ironing surface (it's a 22"" X 60"" cover made out of plywood covered with batting and silver reflective fabric that basically sits on top of my ironing board) Cutting table Trash bag next to cutting table Lots of light including what comes in through the window  Can't wait to see what you do with your new room!"
quilting,3bldee,Grymalcyn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:54:12 2015 UTC,awesome :) That cutting table looks just like one my grandpa made for my grandmas sewing room a few years back. And what is the design wall made of? felt? Ive seen them on reddit but never in person.

Plus, you can keep your pieces up on the wall with less danger of Kitty siding into them and rearranging them for you. There are times that mine are up there for weeks before I finally finish sewing them all together. And if you don't find the Fons & Porter design wall, a piece of flannel taped to the wall will work just fine. Or you can use the suggestion that /u/grymalcyn has for a more portable solution.

quilting,3bldee,Grymalcyn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:03:24 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend a large ironing surface, versus a traditional ironing board. I made one that was 2' by 2', using heat reflective material I'd bought at a quilt convention.  If you can accommodate something bigger, I'd go even larger, honestly. Since I usually make queen or king sized quilts, I'd be thrilled if I had something that could cover an entire table.  I'd also evaluate your scrap habits. We quilters make a lot of scraps. Are you the type to use your scraps? If so, do you sort by color or size, etc...? Depending on your scrap hoarding habits (that is one of my 'problems', lol), you might wish to develop storage that works with those habits. I personally cut my scraps into ready to use squares and strips (2"", 3.5"" and 5"" squares and strips out of whatever is left), and then sort by color. Each color has a labeled plastic shoe box.   I also vote for a high cutting table. I've then used command strips and hooks to hand all of my rulers on the wall above my cutting area.  I also love having a design wall. If you watch for coupons/sales, you can pick up the Fons & Porter gridded design for fairly cheap. Otherwise, you can buy sheets of insulation at a home improvement store and spray glue batting to them, and then use command strips to hang the panels you've just made. I blogged about my design wall back when I made mine up."

I'm working on my first quilt and for the backing, I'm not sure what I should do because the fabric on the bolt wouldn't have enough width to cover the back of my quilt. Should I just piece it together? I don't know if that would look strange with a seam going down the middle.  I hope my question makes sense.  You all are a huge inspiration! :)"
quilting,3bhu21,-yvette-,2,Sat Jul 4 03:57:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, piece it! Depending on how dense the actual quilting on the sandwich will be you won't even notice another seam in the back that much.   Some of us made a habit of piecing the back to incorporate scraps or additional blocks from the top. Just make sure everything's pressed and you're good to go!   Because fabric from the bolt won't always be big enough to provide the whole back there's another possibility: Sometimes I use an old bedspread to get a continuous look. I like the scrappy ones better, though :)"

All the tutorials are for machines so they just cut and continue but when I do that I've cut through the thread holding the center in and it needs to be done a second time. I've been trying to cut it pinned but it's just really hard to get right. I must be missing something.  Edit: It's hard to describe so here's a pic of an old waste patch for example. See if I kept cutting along that line, it would break the threads connecting the center square to all the others. Am I just supposed to be sewing the center seams twice? http://imgur.com/I2dwQx1.jpg  After cutting I'm left with this http://imgur.com/yaevv4P.jpg and have to sew in 4 little squares. There has to be a better method so I don't waste so much time and thread...  Edit bajillion: I figured it out, I sew two sections on the center seams and cut between them."
quilting,3bhu21,gorramquilts,4,Mon Jun 29 18:54:28 2015 UTC,"It might be easier to just cut out the individual pieces - little squares, rectangles, and large squares - and sew them together. The D9P is cool and all, but if you're just going to have to resew the pieces because they came apart after you cut into them, it seems like individual pieces to begin with might be the easiest solution."

quilting,3bhu21,gorramquilts,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:51:32 2015 UTC,"Ahh, gotcha. When I did hand quilting, I used a thread that was coated in wax (YLI maybe?). I imagine that might help hold the pieces together.   And thank you! :)"
quilting,3bhu21,Drpepperholik,2,Tue Jun 30 16:52:35 2015 UTC,"I don't hand sew but yeah, cutting through the seams is kinda the idea here. I've made a tossed 9 patch (same thing, different name) where you sew 9 squares together and then cut them vertically, turn, cut again to get 4 little blocks that you turn and twist to sew back together into a big block. I feel like you'd be making more work for yourself to try to cut it pinned as it won't ever lay flat that way for a good clean cut. I once heard quilting described as cutting large bolts of fabric into smaller pieces, sew them up only to cut them again into even smaller pieces to sew up and cut. Truer words have never been spoken."
quilting,3bhu21,spermface,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"So do you just re-sew the seam you cut through? Or do you reknot the ends of the thread after you cut it in half? I figured that wasn't the most efficient way but perhaps it is. Edit: I see your using a machine, so it probably stays on its own."
quilting,3bhu21,Drpepperholik,2,Mon Jun 29 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"I don't back stitch on my machine or anything like knotting it. After you cut the 9 patch and rearrange the little blocks to sew them back together any tails will get sewn up in the seam allowances when you sew the little blocks to their neighbors and the big blocks to their neighbors.  Edit: I see what you mean now. I don't know then, I don't have experience with hand sewing. Maybe wait for someone else to chime in."

I don't know how it would be if I'd gotten all the surrounding squares in but it doesn't seem like it could hold up to someone sleeping with it and tugging it. Maybe if I back stitch the whole way."

quilting,3bhu21,Drpepperholik,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"The quilting is what holds it all together. Hmm, maybe do a quick tack stitch on the center square as you're sewing the rows together so the tack is on either side of where you'll be cutting it? That way it won't fall apart maybe?  I'm not in my element here as I don't hand sew."
quilting,3bhu21,spermface,2,Mon Jun 29 22:32:11 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I didn't even think about the fact that I'm going over all this at the end. Good thing there's a thread for dumb questions! Lol. I 'm going try that, just basting it together enough to hold til I quilt it."
quilting,3bhu21,-yvette-,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:48:55 2015 UTC,I don't quite understand what you mean/what the problem is. A disappearing 9patch always involves sewing bigger blocks and then cutting them apart again. Is it making the seams fall apart? If it's just a bit around the new edge maybe a basting stitch helps until you've sewn on the next part.   Maybe it helps watching someone do it? Here's a video tutorial machine-stitching it: https://youtu.be/dEjZOXxPazg  Here's a tutorial with lots of pictures: http://www.stitcherydickorydock.com/scrappy-disappearing-9-patch-tutorial/
quilting,3bhu21,spermface,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"Well I'm cutting through the thread I sewed the center square in with. So that whole seam is undone. The center square is just hanging on by s cut thread, it comes completely off if tugged a little, and it seems like I need to redo it. I've already seen that tutorials actually and they just say to cut through which is where I'm having a problem. If I don't redo those seams the quilt can't stay together, the threads are unknotted. I was assuming I'm not supposed to just do those 4 seams twice because then it seemed like a waste of time to sew then together first. I thought maybe there was a hand method. I don't think machine method applies because the stitches knot themselves, right?"
quilting,3bhu21,SandyQuilter,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:05:40 2015 UTC,"I don't hand sew either, so when I sew by machine I do cut through the seam / threads. I'm thinking that if it's a problem for you when hand sewing, maybe do like /u/-yvette- suggests and take a little basting stitch or two at the cut spot. And/or make your stitches as small as you can so you have more holding the blocks together when you cut through the stitching.   Also, are you setting your seams before cutting? Basically to do that, you steam press the sewn-together blocks flat, THEN press the seam to one side or the other. By doing this, you are allowing the stitches to be sort of sucked into the fabric threads. That might help you with any coming apart issues. Good luck!"
quilting,3bhu21,spermface,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm, basting is a good idea if time consuming. But if I just used smaller stitches and sewed it together leaving unknotted thread won't it fall apart in time?   And yeah I set my seams. But that doesn't make it study enough to hold it together."
quilting,3bhu21,SandyQuilter,3,Mon Jun 29 21:18:45 2015 UTC,"Hmmmmmmm, that's something I hadn't thought of, since I don't hand sew. I know that when my machine sews across another seam, it seems to make the first stitches get locked into place and they don't come apart. If you hand quilt too, maybe that would help --- make sure you take a couple of stitches (in different directions maybe) over those joints?"
quilting,3bhu21,navybluestars,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:35:55 2015 UTC,"Do you all iron/starch your layer cakes and charm packs before starting sewing, even if they don't reaaaallly need ironed because there's no wrinkles?

I haven't done PP in awhile and have a BOM which has 2 PP blocks.   1) I feel like I'm supposed to fold the paper along the lines before I sew, to make it easier to rip later. Am I remembering that right?  2) If I'm making blocks that are attached to each other, do I tear out the paper after each block is made, or wait until they're all attached and tear off at the very end?   Gracias!"
quilting,3bhu21,SandyQuilter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:32:05 2015 UTC,"I don't typically fold my paper first. I have a hard time folding perfectly straight lines and just don't want to take the time. The thing you really do need to do is shorten your stitch length. A lot. The more times you have perforated that paper, the easier it will be to rip out. And THAT's when I fold it - just before I rip that part. Some people sew (without thread) along the lines on just the paper, then sew the fabric to the paper - perforating it twice. That makes me nervous though - what it if all rips apart before I'm ready to have that happen???  When I learned paper piecing, I was taught to leave the paper on until the edges are all encased in stitches to minimize bias stretching. But then in a class I took this past year, the instructor told us we could starch the heck out of each block and then rip the paper off before sewing the blocks together (but keep the fabric flat on the table when you rip to help minimize the stretching). I kind of like pulling the paper off - it's mindless work I can do while watching TV.  Oh, and you're welcome. You know, since you said gracias. :-)"

She showed me a way that she bastes her pieces around the paper without piercing the paper at all and she uses squares instead of hexies cut 1/4"" larger than her paper. I was awe struck by how simple it looked!  She starts in a corner, folds the fabric over the paper, catches each side in a couple of stitches, anchors the center, then does the other corner. When she's done with basting it she trims the inside excess fabric to be a quarter inch.  From what I read/watched about EPP you don't remove the paper until you've attached that piece to it's neighbors all around. I figure that's so they're easier to handle and hold while sewing it to its neighbor when they have the paper in there still."

I need to cut more patches. I'm thinking about doing the quilt 12x12 patches. I plan to gift it to my friend as she is having her first child in December so it will be smaller then a full sized quilt. Just...what do you guys think? I've pinned the patches together to get an idea of what it will look like but haven't started sewing yet. Is it going to work you guys? :(  http://imgur.com/jxfODXt
quilting,3bhu21,SandyQuilter,2,Wed Jul 1 22:40:49 2015 UTC,"I think it will be great! Once you get the strips sewn, then sewn to each other, you'll have a better idea of what you're dealing with, size wise. And if you want to add a border to make it bigger, you can make that decision at that time.  Since you say it's your first quilt EVER, may I make a suggestion? Be sure to press each seam to help make everything lie nice & flat. You-tube videos can show you what I'm talking about. And take your time - December is a nice long way away! Can't wait to see your progress!"
quilting,3bhu21,tz67,2,Wed Jul 1 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"Are all the squares cut to the exact same size?  It's very important to start with accurate cuts.  The next important thing is that you use a 1/4 inch seam allowance.  There should be a guide on your sewing machine that will help you maintain the proper seam allowance.  So if you're starting with a 5 in square, you'll finish with a 4 1/2 inch square.  Then like /u/SandyQuilter said, iron your seams flat to one side.    The next important step is when you sew the rows together.  You need to nest your seam allowances.  This means that when you have 2 seams meeting each other, the seam allowance on the bottom should go one way and the top seam the other.  when you put them together, they nest nicely.  Example, when you sew the first row, you iron the seam to one side, then the next row you iron to the other side.  So when you put these pieces together, you will see how they match up perfectly on the front.    Does this make sense?  Step 1: Accurate cutting, Step 2: 1/4 inch seam, Step 3: iron seam allowances to one side, Step 4: nest your seam allowances as you sew the rows together.    Take your time, watch some videos.  And don't freak out if things aren't exactly perfect when you're done.  I've been quilting 10+ years and I have still never achieved the perfect quilt."

quilting,3beb73,rdppy,6,Sun Jun 28 12:35:06 2015 UTC,I think I like picture 2 better as a border. What color are you using for the binding?
quilting,3beb73,ktigger2,2,Sun Jun 28 14:10:34 2015 UTC,"Also undecided about that. I was thinking maybe the pink or blue. Or I could go scrappy, I have enough left of each color to bind in."

quilting,3bcmsw,quiltr,3,Sun Jun 28 07:18:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. There are definitely directions in the kit.

quilting,3bdbzx,Meretseger,4,Sun Jun 28 03:38:19 2015 UTC,"Wavy edges can occur along bias edges that stretch while sewing. You can prevent this by stabilising the edge of each piece with a long machine stitch (tacking stitch) OR just being very careful when pinning and piecing to not stretch the bias edge. Another reason for wavy edges can be slightly uneven seams - wider at one end of seam, narrower at the other. Again, just be careful when sewing. You can take out some of the waviness by making a tacking stitch along the outside edges and gently and carefully easing the length to a straight edge and fit the binding.  That said, your colour choices and pattern have worked really well!"
quilting,3bdbzx,Scyfyre,3,Sun Jun 28 04:55:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I had some help picking fabric, my fiances mom helped pick stuff out when she was visiting.  She had also warned me that the parallelograms might not be the easiest to start with, so I was happy it turned out as well as it did."

After a bit, you have fabric on hand to use, from your stash, for all kinds of things, or you make a quilt from scraps instead of precuts."
quilting,3bduki,andrea_r,2,Sun Jun 28 17:21:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of quilters use scraps like yours to make a ""scrappy"" binding or sashing. You might not have enough in this case, so if it were me (and I wanted to use the scraps for the binding for instance) I would do some maths and figure out how much more fabric I needed, then buy that amount in a coordinating solid color. That way I save some money.   You said you have some pieces that are 18 x 5.5.. I would cut those in half lengthwise and see them end to end, maybe with some of your smaller pieces in between for variety, to make a 2.25 inch wide binding."
quilting,3bduki,beauxbeaux,2,Sun Jun 28 07:55:06 2015 UTC,"I like to mix up my backing with left over scraps - if it's blocks that didn't make the front or just scraps like in your case.   So a suggestion: I'd just sew the ones of the same size along the longer edges into a big rectangle. Never mind if they're not completely straight, just 'square them up' after you've sewn all together.  This way you're left with two different sized rectangles. Depending on how big your quilt will be you can cut up the backing two times and sew the rectangles between these parts. If they don't reach all the way from edge to efge, don't try to center them but make them asymmetric on purpose.   http://imgur.com/a/h8eWd Here's one i did a while back. That onealso used the Scrappy sashing idea /u/beauxbeaux described! Sorry for bad mobile phone picture of the finished one. But you can see that i used the scrap sashing (there's no two pieces of the same size btw) but i still had scraps left. So the back is using those left overs. There were too many for just one strip across but not enough for one all the way down... so i did the scrappy back :)   That's just ideas, whatever you'll do it'll be just fine :) there's always the possibility to save those scraps until you're comfortable making a project with smaller stripes or scraps! I've got two boxes full of those. There's always another project that need just that little extra..."

quilting,3bduki,teardrop87,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"I have read where people cut their scraps into usable pieces, for instance, the 18 x 5.5 could be cut into 2 1/2 inch strips.  I had a quilt where I had tons of left over fabric, so I cut them into 2 1/2 in strips.  Then I used those strips plus a solid and made another quilt.  I still had left over pieces, so I am making a wall hanging.  It was all made easier because I cut those 2 1/2 in strips.  The 1 inch strips are too small to use."

Finally, disappearing nine patches are very forgiving so it will look great, I promise. All that being said, make sure your starting blocks are square, try to keep your 1/4"" seam consistent, square up your nine patch before cutting and admire your handiwork. Most importantly- have fun."
quilting,3bbbo7,Gelldarc,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"I love the colors! They don't match any of my decor but it's going to be a nap quilt. 48x72 without the border. I'm a bit nervous about the turquoise color. I cannot remember if it was broadcloth with polyester in it.   I kind of went wild last weekend at Joanns (saved $120, spent $110!!). I had no idea until I refolded it that its like twice as wide as quilting cottons, maybe 100"" selvage to selvage. I think I'm going to use it as the backing fabric too. Everything I've been reading online talks about shrinkage when washing, so we'll see! Thank you!"
quilting,3bbbo7,-yvette-,4,Sun Jun 28 02:28:49 2015 UTC,"Don't panic - to be honest, that looks exactly like from my cutting mat. Whether it's the fabric that sometimes stretches after pressing or the squares were cut just a liiiiiittle differently, that happens to the best of us. I'm sure. That's why we square blocks! Or, in my case, shrug it off as another happy accident :)  I think you did the right thing by nesting your seams, because your corners look awesome! Really. Great alignment on those pictures. As you've already finished at least one block: Keep to it! I second the suggestion of /u/thatbitchattheIRS : square after sewing the second step. You can then tape marks on your ruler that have to align to some of the  seams and then cut all blocks to the same size. That way you can continue to nest your seams in the next step which you seem to do really great!   Please share when you're done! I have a similar flower print :) it's nice to see some ideas for it."

Made silly math mistakes & found that my rearranged, sewn together block was going to be 13.5"" square instead of 12.5"" which I was planning on. I bought a square ruler and everything.   So how am I to square these up? Turns out the blocks weren't even 13.5"". I tried squaring the small quadrants before sewing them together at 7"". Nope, they weren't that either. Ha, hence the frustration.  After fretting and thinking hard for a while, I said fuck it and centered my blocks under my 12.5 inch ruler and hacked away. Here is 4 blocks laid out to show what it will look like. The turquoise diagonal accent pieces will be large in one row and small in the next. Damn, this is hard to explain!  I've learned so much already during this project. But it works, I'm happy! Thank you guys so much. I'll be sure to post when it's done!"

You will continue to learn as you keep going in this obsession hobby. In my little head, I just keep telling myself to be consistent.

Take your favorite quilt, blanket or whatever and curl up and close your eyes.   You are not only missing it, you're feeling guilty for feeling like you're missing it.... I felt like this for MANY years.   So, once I figured that out - I my mid 30's-  I started asking for days of quilting for birthday, holidays, whenever, and I cherished them..    Hubby (now divorced) soon realized, momma ain't happy if she's not quilting.... He got to do his 'hobbies'.... Two week hunting excursions etc.   and it became a pattern that I could carve three hours on a week night and three on the weekend, if I wanted them, and he couldn't say no, I'm not watching Holly.   It took some time to make it a habit, but it was glorious.   And... If he bitched about clean floors.... I usually took double the time- we both worked full time at intense jobs and my elderly mother lived with us- his choice not mine... I needed to quilt, it's therapy.  Stop feeling guilty and sew for 20 minutes..... Two seams today....  Two seams tomorrow - it's not a race. Great big quilt crazy hugs to you.     Sorry for type os.  On my cell.   Hugs!!!!!!!"
quilting,3b9h6k,thatbitchattheIRS,3,Sat Jun 27 02:18:17 2015 UTC,"What she said. :)  If you can carve out a teeny space - anywhere - crammed n the corner even - just 15 mins will help. Especially if you can leave the machine set up to sew in teeny snatches of time.  We've all been there and it does suck (omg WORK, ugh, i feel your pain there) but it WILL pass.  (makes note to come back and read this for herself as needed)"
quilting,3b9h6k,andrea_r,4,Sat Jun 27 10:08:40 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I mostly come to this sub to stalk (haven't actually dove into quilting yet...) But I'm also a crafter and totally get the feels you are feeling. Is there any chance you could make a small quilting bag up with like some paper piecing bits set to go? I know as a cross stitcher and knitter I need to have a small project with me whenever (stuck at the doctors, car broke down/oil change, waiting on something else...) That I have something to keep me happy - I've seen a lot of folks on Instagram get into mini blocks :) lots of little hexies and such (heck even pretty coasters!) - smaller more portable instant gratification projects! (Trust me, in between having time doing a huge project, I try to have a few small ones to keep me sane). Are any of your classes lectures? Do you learn okay by listening mostly with only a few notes? You could try doing some small projects then too (I used to knit in some lecture halls - some teachers didn't care). Anyway, you can get through it :) and in the mean time go on Instagram and Pinterest and make lists of things you will want to make later for inspiration when you have a moment so you don't have to spend too much time deciding on what to make then."
quilting,3b9h6k,purrfectpurling,3,Sat Jun 27 10:50:36 2015 UTC,Great idea! I'm using this method to paper piece: http://www.afewscraps.com/2012/03/basting-your-paper-pieces.html?m=1  I sometimes do this during long journeys by car so i stay occupied and won't start to get sick.  Best thing about this: You don't need glue for everything to stick to its place.  It can be left and will not unravel. Only have 10 min? Cover some shapes in fabric. Tomorrows 10 min? Baste some on the back. Next weeks 10 min? Join two together...
quilting,3b9h6k,-yvette-,3,Sat Jun 27 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"Even if you can't get to your sewing machine, you can keep the quilting side of your brain active!  Keep a notebook of ideas for when you do have time to get back to it, so you can prevent a creativity-freeze in the future.  If you have just a few spare minutes, grab a cup of tea and sit with your notebook to dream and plan.   You can design blocks, patterns, doodle your ideal fabric, or practice your free-motion quilting skills by putting the pen down on the page and covering the page without lifting it up (to practice how you will sew).  Or you could find a new way to organize your fabrics and space.  (Sometimes just re-folding my fabrics or re-grouping piles of fat quarters is soothing!)  Hang in there!  It's tough when life gets in the way of our hobbies, but quilting is a skill that will always be ready and waiting for you when you have the time."
quilting,3b9h6k,aceydoodle,2,Sat Jun 27 13:55:38 2015 UTC,"I do this all the time! The number of quilts I have designed during staff meetings....

quilting,3b9h6k,SilverVixen1928,3,Wed Jul 1 20:57:37 2015 UTC,"Hugs! it is tough to just not have enough hours in the day to get to what you love, and pine for it. When I had my son it was rough, he was very colicky and the colic did not go away after 4 months. With a full time job, and a baby that wanted me every moment of the day I just didn't have time to sew (or the mental capacity or energy). I dreamed of it though. So just keep dreaming. You will get to create and enjoy eventually."
quilting,3b9h6k,DesertBloomQuilter,3,Sat Jun 27 03:23:49 2015 UTC,"I don't comment much, but hey, I trained someone deemed untrainable- and it was not an awful experience.  They key for this person was to gear my expectations way down.  They were not young, but I approached the situation as if they were 16, working their first job.  So I couldn't get mad or frustrated if they did not know simple business stuff- first job.  This person was also a very poor reader, and frustration never makes that better, so all that mental gymnastics really helped me figure out how to get this person functioning on the job.  Good luck, is what I am saying, and you can do it, and I love quilts too."

Try to remember it gets better - slowly but surely. Try to remember that the occasional dirty floor or take away dinner doesn't mean you'll lose your superwoman skills, it just means you're smarter than all the others because you know that to save the world, you have to save yourself first. Be gentle with yourself and the rest will come. Hugs."

It makes me personally happy to know that someone else enjoys seeing what I've been doing.  I'm in a sorta similar situation to you. I was a sewing maniac the first 3 months of this year and then ""life"" got in the way. Went to visit grandkids and my mom, then my brother's job transferred him out of state so we had to scramble to figure out all the logistics of moving Mom from one assisted living facility to a new one near us (1400 miles away). Now weekends and evenings are taken up with visits to Mom making sure she's settled and happy, etc. Today is the first chance I've had in months to sew and I just finished a little wall hanging for her door. I'll post a photo later today (after we visit).   Hang in there and cherish the family. Kids are only little for so long - whereas your fabric and sewing machine will still be there when you have the chance to get back to it. You are making the right choices now and soon will be able to make different ones.  That untrainable person is lucky to have you to help her. I bet you can do it! Dry those tears (when you're done) and hang in there. Come back often and soak in all the wonderful things /u/Gelldarc said. Hugs!"

quilting,3b9h6k,-yvette-,2,Sat Jun 27 03:38:58 2015 UTC,"Don't let that pressure get you down. It's much. Very much. I understand. But don't put everything and everyone before yourself! It's ok to say you need 1h or 30 mins or just ten mins a week/day to do something just for you. It's ok to stay sane :) if you know what i mean.  I don't know what equipment you currently have on your hands, but small projects like a pin cushion or a nice fabric flower brooch made with english paper piecing Techniques can be done with 5 things: thread, needle, fabric, paper and paperclips. Oh, and scissors of course.  ;)  http://www.afewscraps.com/2012/03/basting-your-paper-pieces.html?m=1 (see my comment somewhere above) That's basically the technique I'm using. You can do this while relaxing and talking to your husband, while in class or while in the bathtub ;)  Even if that's not an option, please try to squeeze in some time for yourself. 2 mins, eyes closed and just breathing during lunchbreak. You'll come out of it only stronger."
quilting,3b9h6k,K1W1Chick,2,Sat Jun 27 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"At some point we all feel this way. Life can quite easily get in the way of what we actually want to be doing. So far this year, I've only finished 3 quilts (from start to finish) & I did them all in less that two weeks as they were teacher gifts. I could only sew/quilt after putting the kids down for bed, so was working every night from 8pm until 1am. I was only getting around 5-6 hours sleep so I could fit it in. It wasn't my best work, but it was something personal for the teachers.  Since then, I haven't been near my machine (& it's next to my bed) & don't see being able to do any more quilting until after the 4th of July when my kids are back in school.  Keep your chin up. You're doing awesome stuff for your family & I'm sure they love & appreciate everything you do."

quilting,3b3fag,DeliberateLiterate,3,Thu Jun 25 17:28:19 2015 UTC,This would happen with my old machine (mechanical Singer Tradition) every time I started stitching. What fixed it was simply to gently hold the thread tails from the bobbin and needle as I began stitching. Seems that if I didn't do this the needle would go down to pick up the bobbin thread and it would pull the tail down with it creating that kind of gobbledy gook.
quilting,3b3fag,Drpepperholik,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:55:56 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I'll try that if/when it happens again

quilting,3b3fag,andrea_r,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:21:41 2015 UTC,The needle and bobbin aren't syncing up. When I get this problem its usually something to do with the threading of the machine and its creating tension issues

quilting,3ayg3q,trainednoob,10,Wed Jun 24 14:42:31 2015 UTC,"Have you thought about hand quilting it? I did it on a full size quilt (much smaller) - and it was such a fun project. I come from a long line of Amish quilters and everyone always quilts by hand, so I wanted to keep up the tradition. It gave me something to do in the evenings when I wanted to relax, because it's quite easy to hold it on your lap and just do a bit at a time with a quilting loop. Anyway, just a suggestion that would put a little extra love into your quilt without costing you anything : )"

quilting,3ayg3q,SandyQuilter,7,Wed Jun 24 14:48:35 2015 UTC,"First of all, your quilt is beautiful. I can tell that a lot of work went into it. When you've put that kind of time and effort into making such a piece, you definitely want to be sure it's finished nicely as well.  Owning a longarm quilting machine is an investment. They are not cheap ... and if they are computerized, they cost even more. Most longarm quilters I've encuntered charge about 2 cents per square inch of the quilt. More for more intricate quilting patterns. Others charge by the bobbin. You might want to do a little shopping around to see if there are other options for you that might cost a bit less. Some quilt shops rent time on their long arm machines (after a training session with you) so you can do the work yourself, usually for a lower price than you might pay for having someone else do the quilting.  Enjoy your new home and your family and if you need to, do what you suggested and save your gift money (and maybe ask for more from relatives to put toward getting the quilt finished)."

I know a long arm machine is a huge investment that's why I don't have one... lol I think I will try shop around and bit and save up at the same time. Thanks again for all your help!"
quilting,3ayg3q,bigchill1964,2,Wed Jun 24 18:12:52 2015 UTC,I appreciated how you made sure you weren't annoyed with the quilter's prices and you were just trying to see if that was par for the course. Your top is beautiful and I honestly think it will be worth the wait of saving up and maybe shopping around to get it done well. Post a photo of the finished project when you've gotten it done?
quilting,3ayg3q,-yvette-,3,Wed Jun 24 18:30:57 2015 UTC,I will for sure. There is a place that will do it for around 170$ but it's an hour drive away (they have done some of my sister's quilts so I know they are ok too). Thankfully family lives up there so I can write off the drive as a family visit and not count that towards the price of the quilt. The only problems are finding the time to go out there and that it's still a bit expensive. I might still wait but now that it's finished and ready to go I am eager to have it all done. I am bummed that this lady won't be doing it. I really like her she's so friendly and cheerful and helpfull.
quilting,3ayg3q,rdppy,2,Wed Jun 24 19:09:34 2015 UTC,Could you ship it to her?   Also check out missiouri star quilting company.  Goggle them.   They do quilting and ship it back to you. You can get a price quote before sending.  They do a wonderful job.  Quilting is very expensive hobby.

quilting,3ayg3q,boss_magpie,3,Fri Jun 26 02:57:48 2015 UTC,"First off: you should be in love with it, it's a beautiful quilt top!  I don't know about price ranges in the US, but it seems reasonable to me (I'm in Germany). I've only had one quilt quilted by a longarm quilter nearby and she charged 160€ for an all-over print over a double sized quilt (1.40m x 2.00m; with current exchange that's roughly 180$). I've linked it before, it's this one (I stated another measurement on the third pic, but I've ripped parts of it apart because there were some waves in it and shortened it quite a bit. It's now exactly 1.40m x 2.00m, which is the size of my bed)  I provided the top, batting and back of the quilt, it would have been even more if she used her own batting (which apparently most of her customers do), and even more if she did different patterns over the different areas of my quilt. So 300 for a King Size (which is substantially bigger) sounds about right to me..  You're right, Quilting is an expensive hobby! Even more so when you have to pay double prices on most fabrics here in Germany :( One meter of cotton fabric costs between 16 and 18€ (~18-20$). So my advice is: Just treat yourself once christmas or your birthday have been there. It will be even more of a treasure then!"
quilting,3ayg3q,runningstitch,3,Wed Jun 24 15:39:51 2015 UTC,Too right about German fabric prices! Glad I waited until I found a job here before I started quilting (although I had a lot more time then.) Have you ever been to one of the traveling Stoffmarkts? I just heard about them. I am hoping one comes my way soon.

Already looks like a great heirloom :)  Regarding your question: no, i didn't design it. I've seen that design being appliqued over a black background and decided I'm not doing that :) i pieced it instead. Original: look for 'shine through'. The other ones are great as well!

However, and I'm sure others here do it, when the quilt is not for myself but made for someone else, it is washed and dried and the second it comes out of the machines it is folded and packed for mailing and tends to be devoid of cat fur and dander to a pretty good degree. But sadly, it's become very clear to me that for some reason, cats really really love quilts. I'm wondering if it's the batting."

Normally Norma will settle on my lap and purr contentedly while I cut. Caprica is the one who sits and refuses to budge.

I did it with my regular foot and it turned out nicely but my individual pieces are pretty big so I decided to go at it again and fill in some of the space with free motion lines. The lines are turning out horrible. I can't keep an even speed, the temporary spray adhesive I used has mostly lost its grip so I'm getting noticeable wrinkling/pleating, and whenever I take my foot off the pedal I have a habit of immediately releasing my hands and if the needle is up my quilt shifts.   I've free motion quilted about 80% of it so far... I keep thinking that it's crazy to rip out so much quilting but part of me wants to. I thought it might be easier to just separate the entire thing rather than just ripping out the free motion quilting but the stitch-in-the-ditch-ing turned out really well and took so much time and effort.

quilting,3ap2bu,SandyQuilter,3,Tue Jun 23 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite things about quilting is that there are very few hard & fast rules. My philosophy is ""it's YOUR quilt, so make it the way you want to!"" That being said, there are some good reasons that we have some of the guidelines we have (like consistent seam allowances, for example).   Off the top of my head, I suppose you could. Here's how I think I would do it.  Cut the final border 1.25 inches wider than you need. Sew it to the quilt top. Leave that extra 1.25 inches hanging over as you baste and quilt the top. Once you're done quilting, turn the quilt over and CAREFULLY trim the backing and batting so you still have that extra 1.25 inches. Press the extra 1.25 inches in half, folding it into the inside to make a nice knife edge. Top stitch that extra border part from the back so you are going straight. The corners might be a challenge, but I'm sure you could figure out a way to make them work.  Can you picture what I'm saying?"
quilting,3ap2bu,drzels,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:31:42 2015 UTC,"How necessary is a walking foot for attaching binding? I've read that if you don't have a walking foot, binding straight grain is easier than cross. Is this true?  I've only finished one quilt and the binding was the only thing that did not turn out well. Hoping to improve on this for my second. Thank you!"
quilting,3ap2bu,SandyQuilter,4,Mon Jun 22 15:52:39 2015 UTC,"I use my walking foot for binding all the time. I find that it helps keep everything smooth and even. My sister, on the other hand, uses her regular foot. So I guess it's a personal preference. I have no idea about straight vs. cross grain ... I just pin whenever I'm having issues and keep on going.  The binding was probably the toughest part of quilting for me at the beginning. I think (for me, at least) part of the reason was just that it was the END of the project and I was tired and didn't take the time to be careful. Now I know to wait until ""tomorrow"" to do the binding or I'll be frustrated.  Eleanor Burns of Quilt In A Day has some really good youtube videos of binding. Maybe take a peek and see if she can help you?"
quilting,3ap2bu,drzels,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:58:31 2015 UTC,"Ahh yes, being tired and also the final step of the project-- part of me was just like ¯_(ツ)_/¯ QUILT DONE. Definitely going to be more careful and give myself more time this time around.   If I decide to make more quilts I will invest in a walking foot, but for now I'll check out those youtube videos. Thanks!"
quilting,3ap2bu,andrea_r,2,Mon Jun 22 16:09:06 2015 UTC,"It mostly helps with the shifting of all those layers. Doesn't have much to do with straight or cross grain AFAICT.  While not necessary, a walking foot just makes it way easier. other wise you're pinning the heck out of it.  I use a walking foot and no pins."
quilting,3ap2bu,beauxbeaux,2,Tue Jun 23 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"I've successfully binded (bound) three quilts withOUT a walking foot. It took way longer than necessary, because every few inches i would stop with the needle down and readjust.. but it honestly worked very well.   I don't have a walking foot yet. :/"
quilting,3ap2bu,gorramquilts,2,Wed Jun 24 00:53:56 2015 UTC,"My first binding: ""I'll use my regular foot, no big deal"" ... ""wow, the top layer really got stretched from the bottom"" My second binding: ""I'll try the walking foot. Not sure how this will help but, I'll give it a try"" ... ""Holy poop, it didn't shift at all""  I do my binding straight of grain and, yeah, walking foot made a difference."
quilting,3ap2bu,xtamarie,2,Wed Jun 24 17:19:39 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, a walking foot makes a lot of straight line stitching much easier, but I wouldn't call it necessary. They can be found relatively cheaply on Amazon, so it's worth a shot. If you don't like, it don't use it! But for what it's worth, seeing as so many of us dread binding, I thought I might share this little trick:   90% of the time, instead of cutting binding strips, I cut my backing about 3 inches too large and use that as a binding. You just have to iron it in half, so the raw edge meets with your quilt front, then fold it again, and sew it straight to the front with the machine. (or you could hand sew) Walking foot or not, this comes out SO much better for me than a real binding. I don't know if there's any reason why one SHOULDN'T do this, as I find it much easier, simpler, and neater. My mitered corners come out so crisp with this method. If anyone has a reason, do share. But it has become a lifesaver for me. The only problem is if you really want your binding to be a different fabric than your backing, this won't work. But I usually don't so I just go with it. I hope this helps someone :)  Here is a picture tutorial (not mine!) that shows how this is done: http://www.cluckclucksew.com/2014/01/binding-quilt-with-quilt-back.html (edit: added link. derp.)  Another edit: an alternative method I use, with binding strips or backing, is to do a zig-zag stitch for the binding. Who says it has to be a straight stitch? This is much more forgiving, adds stability, and looks really fun! Just an idea!"
quilting,3ap2bu,-yvette-,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:32:13 2015 UTC,I realized I used to do this for almost all of my quilts I finished before this year! Mostly because it's so easy and i didn't have a 'better' technique. Now that I know how to bind with a binding strip I'm trying to practice this a bit until I'm satisfied with the results. But the folding over of the backing is still a great way to finish.
quilting,3ap2bu,IrisesAndLilacs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:00:05 2015 UTC,"Binding drives me nuts! My least favourite part of the whole quilt. But I finally have binding that looks right because... I glue instead of pin. Crazy. Did not think when I started quilting  I would be using elmers school glue (washable), but it is fantastic for binding and even in some of my appliqué."
quilting,3ap2bu,mischiefmanaged19,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:25:30 2015 UTC,"So I am a pretty novice quilter (have made 3-4 quilts) and my husbands coworker approached him wondering if I could finish a t shirt quilt that he has started. Supposedly, he has already 'sewed all the shirts together' and just needs help 'finishing'. I haven't seen the top yet, but I have to imagine that he didn't use any sort of interfacing or stabilizing material. Do you guys think it will turn into a total disaster if I just try to quilt it like any other quilt top? Any tips for how to not ruin it? Or should I stay away all together? I appreciate any tips you can provide!"
quilting,3ap2bu,I_am_Not_a_Z0mbie,3,Wed Jun 24 15:33:15 2015 UTC,I would spray starch and iron the heck out of that thing and then try to do light quilting on the shirts themselves(:
quilting,3ap2bu,andrea_r,2,Wed Jun 24 20:31:16 2015 UTC,I've been making tshirt quilts with no interfacing and they have actually been easier to quilt. the interfacing is really only used to help sew it to any cotton sashing.  I do stretch it a bit when I baste it though.

quilting,3ap2bu,-yvette-,2,Thu Jun 25 16:39:10 2015 UTC,"Like this http://m.imgur.com/lZyVZMi  This has been very lightly quilted, so you can't really see much 3D lines on it. The batting is showing and the back as well. I just shortened it on all sides  as it was to be flipped over and act as binding.   This has been a work in progress pic of pinning another binding (also the back fabric... huh. i used to do this quite a lot before i learned to do a 2.5"" binding strip): http://i.imgur.com/30w0KqN.jpg You can see a bit 3D effect there.

quilting,3ap2bu,DeliberateLiterate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:08:02 2015 UTC,"Should I wash a quilt before I give it away?  I prewashed all of the fabric, but I'm scared to throw the whole thing in the wash, lol!"
quilting,3ap2bu,Grymalcyn,3,Fri Jun 26 12:40:40 2015 UTC,"I always wash before I give a quilt away, for all of the reasons listed by /u/tz67 and /u/-yvette-, as well as the following:  1.) I have cats. And I don't want to be the reason a family finds out their little one is allergic. (I usually only give baby quilts away.)  2.) As I usually only give baby quilts away, I expect that they'll be washed. I don't want the quilt to be washed for the first time by the recipients, and have them panic when it no longer looks quite the same. I want the receiving family to see the quilt in all of its crinkly, ready-to-be-loved-to-rags glory, and to not feel like I've given them a work of art that can't be used."
quilting,3ap2bu,tz67,2,Sat Jun 27 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"I always wash the quilts before giving them away.  Here's why.. if something happens to the quilt in the washer, you want to be the one to discover it, not the recipient.  If your washer isn't big enough, then take it to the laundromat and use their larger machines.  Make sure you give the person washing instructions to make the quilt last a long time.  For instance, never dry in the dryer!    If there is ANY chance that the fabric could run, use a dye grabber you can buy at any fabric store.  I know you prewashed, but depending on the quality of your fabric, it could still bleed.  Why risk that, use a dye grabber."
quilting,3ap2bu,-yvette-,2,Fri Jun 26 15:15:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely! In addition to all of /u/tz67 reasons I also think it should be washed because during the piecing, sandwiching and quilting processes there is always much handling of the fabric and sometimes even dragging over the floor. At least if you're like me, because i simply don't have the space on my sewing table so parts of the (lap sized) quilt will always be on the floor during quilting... :(  Anyways, I just want to give something 'fresh' to the recipient. So I will always wash it and then dry it outside in the sun if possible :) that feeling of a new quilt is so good!"

How've you found dealing with the nap? Is the whole thing going the same way, or just whichever way looks best?"
quilting,3akwet,jillah92,2,Mon Jun 22 23:15:05 2015 UTC,"You're the best, and I was midway through answering your super enthusiastic comment on the WIP post (it legit made me laugh on what was a pretty stressful day, so thanks for that) when I was interrupted and lost the comment on my phone, so I'm really sorry about that.   I've worked with regular old ""commercial"" minky a lot and I never worried about the nap; the appliqués I was cutting were big and complicated with lots of curves, so the nap just sort of napped all over the place. This minky is Spoonflower.com's answer to minky, and I opted to use their product because I wanted as wide a variety of pinks, yellows, and greens as I could find and conventional minky is pretty limited in shades. I found a ""paint chip"" design available in each color palette I was looking for, and I figured that I could cut the petals from the different shaded strips. Which I could. And did.  But what I didn't think about was that spoonflower stamps their designs onto their fabrics, so the minky wasn't a true ""dyed through"" product; it was white minky with a colored paint chip design printed on the top.  Meaning when I cut the petals, one side (the side against the nap? I don't know the terminology to properly explain it) showed white fibers after the exposed edge was stitched down. So to avoid that, I had to make sure that the inner concave edge of each and every petal was on the ""right"" side of the nap so that when I blanket-stitched that edge, it wouldn't be all exposed white fibers.  Night. Mare. Like, this project wasn't hard enough, let's definitely make it even MORE weird and complicated.  So! To answer your question, the nap of each rose petal piece is all running the same way-- toward the center of the flower. :)  As an aside: I love spoonflower a lot and I've had nothing but excellent experiences with their cottons, knits, and satins. All beautiful. Their customer service is always phenomenal, too. I should've had the presence of mind to order a sample before I committed to (really expensive) yardage. And I still recommend their minky-- it's beautiful, crazy soft, and obviously high quality-- provided you're not using it in a project where you're going to have exposed edges."

quilting,3ajvyr,qubist1,6,Sat Jun 20 22:32:16 2015 UTC,It looks similar to a paisley print.  Hope the link helps https://en.m.wikipedia.org/?title=Paisley_(design)
quilting,3ajvyr,scandium1,3,Sat Jun 20 22:47:15 2015 UTC,"It looks like a Persian ""boteh"" print (paisely is a more general version of this print). You might be able to find something similar in an Indian or Pakistani fabric shop."
quilting,3ajvyr,ArmiNouri,2,Sat Jun 20 23:23:05 2015 UTC,"I have no idea where that particular blue paisley is from, but here is a link to a search for blue paisley on fabric.com."

quilting,3ai5z6,-yvette-,8,Sat Jun 20 12:18:05 2015 UTC,The interwebs server isn't big enough for todo list. But great topic. For conversation sake- I have a lap/throw literally on the machine needs the last couple inches of a side and bottom..... Then into the wash.... Sadly it's been there for months.....  My sewing area is in the third floor and it's muggy hot.  So may need to await cooler temperatures.

quilting,3ai5z6,SandyQuilter,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:25:16 2015 UTC,Ugh. Sewing when it's hot is so tough! Especially when it's the quilting stage because you have a blankie on your lap. You can do it. Sending cooling thoughts. And a chilled margarita. :-)

I agreed to help a friend out and test a twin sized pattern that ended up being way more labor intensive than I bargained for.  I need to get it done before Tuesday morning when I get on a plane.  I have all the mini blocks done (which I finished last night at two, but they still need to be assembled and then I need to add 4 borders.   I'm nervous about ruffling.  I don't usually do borders.  Any tips are welcome.  Then I need to find time to press my Heather Ross Briar Rose quilt and prep the backing so I can ship that out to the quilter before I go.  I've never had anything quilted on a long arm, so I'm super excited to see how this turns out.  I also need to wrap up my Cotton + Steel Instagram Mini Quilt Swap (#cottonandsteelminiquiltswap) package and get it shipped to my partner.

quilting,3abj85,ladyameliarose,2,Thu Jun 18 19:32:46 2015 UTC,"Unless you want the exact fabrics, it wouldn't be that hard to do your own take on the pattern. Look at how the various blocks are arranged and do something similar within your limitations.  I only see a few different styles of blocks. The colors are scrappy. Just make some blocks that are similar and see what happens.  You can work on one set of blocks at a time and combine them in pleasing patterns that mimic the original style."
quilting,3abj85,MILeft,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:25:25 2015 UTC,"The fabrics aren't an issue, and I have thought about just making up a similar pattern, working from the image, but it would be nice to support the designer."

This should help with shipping and you may be able to meet, and view the work, of the quilter. T-shirt quilts require that you iron on interfacing before cutting. It is an extra step. Since  you are crafty, maybe the quilter will let you do that step and give a discount. good luck."
quilting,3aba0c,baxterbaddog,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:11:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I could do that. I know how to sew but I don't enjoy it. Hence looking for someone to help out."

quilting,3a978c,riquiscott,9,Thu Jun 18 05:49:38 2015 UTC,This is one of the best T-shirt quilts I've seen. I especially like the idea of using the leftover shirt for the back. Good job!
quilting,3a978c,steffjam,3,Thu Jun 18 11:55:13 2015 UTC,I don't know if I should mark it as an upside or a downside but that much T-shirt and interfacing and all the extra seaming makes the thing way a ton!
quilting,3a978c,littlebugs,3,Thu Jun 18 12:18:37 2015 UTC,Wanted to say the same. OP has made a beautiful quilt.

quilting,3a978c,andrea_r,8,Thu Jun 18 12:19:15 2015 UTC,"Full sized plus some (66x 78); squared-off spiral quilt stitch - first time with this pattern. Done without a template. I like it but I need to work on my technique.  Sashed t-shirts with quilting cotton on the front.  I used left over t-shirt material to create the back (which I like better than the front, lol) Made the sandwich with spray on basting (Dritz) and I am LOVING spray basting! All told, about 6 hours to cut the shirts and iron interfacing, 6 hours to complete the topper, 6 hours for the back, 6 hours to topstitch, 3 hours to bind.   I am not sure I'll do another one of these. I hated quilting it because the t-shirt back would not glide across my machine. I had to ""work it"" the entire time. But overall, I am satisfied.   Open to comments and critiques, please."
quilting,3a978c,craftasaurus,2,Thu Jun 18 05:55:45 2015 UTC,"My first thought was how much I liked how you did that backing.  Great idea using the extra t-shirt material!  Although the quilting part might deter me from doing that.  Did you use a long arm?  If not, I wonder how that would do with the t-shirt backing."
quilting,3a978c,craftasaurus,2,Thu Jun 18 19:21:07 2015 UTC,"LOL ... no, no long arm. Dear god, how I wish I had a long arm! No, the piecing was done a Brother NX600 and the quilt stitching and binding was done on a 1960s Kenmore 148. I do all my topstitching on the Kenmore - - it'll sew 2 car hoods together if I need it to so 4,5,6 layers of fabric are going to be NOTHING. I've sewed 6 layers of denim together on it and it laughs at my lame attempts to kill it."
quilting,3a978c,ktigger2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:09:11 2015 UTC,"LOL no long arm here either. But I have friends that have them. I have a '50s vintage Singer and I bet it'll still be around long after my ""new"" 20-year-old machine. Those old ones are gems. My mother would take the old Singer to our boat to sew new seat covers back in the 70s...up to four layers of Naugahyde. Love that machine."
quilting,3a978c,_THE_WIFE,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"I did a couple tshirt quilts this way and hated it. Then I changed methods.  I now do the fronts more like your back, and guess what? You don't need interfacing that way. :D Use plain cotton on the back and it glides better. The last one I finished was king sized, and yes - FMQ on my domestic, no longarm. I'd guess maybe 10 hrs of custom quilting because I did huge swoopy feathers all over.  Back shown here: https://instagram.com/p/2wSHGjkwKw/"
quilting,3a978c,SandyQuilter,5,Mon Jun 22 11:36:59 2015 UTC,"What a great keepsake for a retiring teacher. I bet she'll love it. Really nice job, the navy sets the blocks off well. I have to say that the back is absolutely stunning! I love how you put all the different sizes etc together, and how nothing really matches up too much. Also, the quilting you did is wonderful! I now want to do one like it, so thanks for that.  I really appreciate you listing the time for the different steps - it makes it seem somehow do-able, since I haven't done one before.  Question- did you use batting in it, or was all the interfacing enough?"
quilting,3a978c,terrahjeanette,2,Thu Jun 18 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"I used 80/20 batting. It helps minimize the ""seam bumps"" since the quilt is essentially double sided.   As for times listed, please keep in mind I'm a little quicker than the average quilter(or so I've been told by my quilting clutch)"
quilting,3a978c,terrahjeanette,2,Thu Jun 18 15:42:28 2015 UTC,Good to know. Thanks.
quilting,3a978c,Marimba_Ani,2,Fri Jun 19 13:30:39 2015 UTC,Cam to say the same as steffjam-love how you placed the t-shirts. Using the extra on the back is genius!

quilting,3a95h1,Grymalcyn,3,Thu Jun 18 05:28:41 2015 UTC,"Baby quilt made for a work friend's little girl, finished in May of 2014. Used some of the oldest stuff in my stash, and it felt awesome! Better image of the top here, and a good view of the straight line quilting here. The backing was pieced, using coordinating fabrics.  This quilt finished up at about 50"" X 50"". I have a hard time making smaller baby quilts. I want my quilts to get worn out with use, which means they need to be big enough for baby to grow into."
quilting,3a95h1,uliarliarpantsonfire,3,Thu Jun 18 05:31:53 2015 UTC,Wow beautiful! Nice work really and I love the pieced back. I have yet to do that but I think I will eventually need to!!
quilting,3a95h1,uliarliarpantsonfire,3,Fri Jun 19 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"I usually do pieced backings, because I'd like to use up my stash, before it becomes a S.A.B.L.E. (Stash Accumulation Beyond Life Expectancy). I also tend to make larger quilts (108"" wide and up), and backing fabrics that are wide enough don't tend to happen."
quilting,3a95h1,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Fri Jun 19 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I .... I think I am already at SABLE! At this point the kids may have to inherit some! I guess I should start piecing backings now! Also I crochet... so there's that stash too. My husband calls me ""Yarn Hoarder""."
quilting,3a95h1,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Fri Jun 19 15:02:17 2015 UTC,"I'm getting closer to SABLE than I like to admit. Thus, I'm on a quest to work only from my stash as much as possible. The only yardage I'm letting myself buy is for backings for quilts that my stash can't cover. And I'm only allowed to buy clearance/sale for those purposes.   And I'm fighting the urge to not become a yarn hoarder, but I desperately want to learn to knit."
quilting,3a95h1,uliarliarpantsonfire,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:10:06 2015 UTC,I learned to crochet last fall. It consumed me. I think it's worse than quilting or sewing because any yarn can become anything. At least in quilting and sewing you wouldn't buy some fabric just because it's so ugly... not so much with yarn! I now have like 5 huge rubbermaid tubs full of yarn under the guest bed. I need an intervention!
quilting,3a95h1,superhubris,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:54:26 2015 UTC,"At least in quilting and sewing you wouldn't buy some fabric just because it's so ugly...   LMAO! Not so in my world! Friends have given me side-eye at some of my fabric choices. The thing to remember is that larger prints/patterns disappear (usually) when cut up for patchwork, so something that is 'ugly', is actually a design opportunity. Or rather, that's how I see those fabrics."
quilting,3a7d6e,ErinGlaser,4,Wed Jun 17 20:21:00 2015 UTC,Wow! Very neat! I've never seen minky used to piece together a top before. How was it to work with? Did you stabilize it first?
quilting,3a7d6e,IrisesAndLilacs,6,Wed Jun 17 20:49:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, it was kind of a nightmare. I definitely had to stabilize it first. It wouldn't have been so bad but I wanted a lot of different shades of pink, yellow, and green minky so I ordered exorbitant ombré yardage from Spoonflower... But because they only stamp on their design, the color didn't carry through the entire weave. Meaning I had to pay really close attention to the nap and cut a certain way so the exposed stitched edge wouldn't show white. Lesson learned there."
quilting,3a7d6e,SandyQuilter,5,Wed Jun 17 23:01:01 2015 UTC,That is stunning and the baby is going to keep it forEVER!
quilting,3a7d6e,SandyQuilter,3,Wed Jun 17 20:51:30 2015 UTC,Thank you! She better! ;) The darker pink roses are cut from an heirloom velvet quilt handmade by baby's great-great-grandmother. So there's a lot of love and history there.

quilting,3a8cmf,MsRatbag,2,Thu Jun 18 00:57:14 2015 UTC,So are you making a block and then also quilting it each day? Or did you have a bunch of blocks pre-made? (Can you tell I'm not totally sure I am allowed to like you still?)

As for the slightly brighter colors that your mom picked for the shams, I wouldn't worry about it - I could hardly spot what you meant, and besides, I would guess that pillow shams will get more and faster wear than the quilt top itself. So it might be better that they started slightly brighter!"

quilting,3a7e7r,IrisesAndLilacs,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:47:01 2015 UTC,Thanks.  The bargello bit was quite a bit easier to do than I thought it would be.
quilting,3a7e7r,IrisesAndLilacs,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:49:06 2015 UTC,That's good to hear! On my bucket list of quilts I'd like to do is a bargello made to look like the northern lights with black appliqué trees around the edges. I'm pretty new to quilting and haven't tried a Bargello yet. I'm glad it went pretty smoothly for you
quilting,3a7e7r,SandyQuilter,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:59:53 2015 UTC,"I used the ""make a tube of strips"" like you see here which you then cut into tubed strips.  I just winged it for the thickness of each tube the first time through.  And since this was a first time trying it out, I decided to move my pattern by 1 full color shift each time. Which means that I opened my tube by ripping the seam between the colors where I wanted to shift.    The top is three repeated sections Full Bargello > Bargello and Fish Center > Full Bargello.  After I made my first Bargello section, I measured each of my widths and made a note for cutting the right widths in the remaining two portions. The middle portion has the same width measures in the same order on either side of my central Goldfish.  The last segment, I mirror arranged the strips on the opposite side of the center goldfish."

It's a balance thing and only practice will solve it!  I would recommend making a couple of small (say 18"" x 18"") quilt sandwiches and practice on those until you have it down.  Once you've got it, do the pattern on something bigger, where you will have the additional headache of the pulls and weight of a full quilt.  Hope that helps!"

quilting,3a2vu0,Siamsa,2,Tue Jun 16 20:16:50 2015 UTC,"that is awesome. I love the colors.   how did you go about making the edges flat, if that makes sense? I.e. instead of the pillow case laying flush against the entire pillow, there is the little flap/ruffle/thingy on the border?"
quilting,3a2vu0,beauxbeaux,2,Wed Jun 24 08:11:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! To make the flat border/ruffle/flange thingy, I decided how big I wanted the finished pillowcase to be, then added another row of patchwork squares on each side. I quilted the piece to a leftover piece of backing fabric before adding the envelope back.  When I added the envelope back, I sewed it to the quilted front by stitching in the ditch along the seam of the extra rows of squares I added. That helped the pillow fit snugly and gave the extra decorative border. Then I just bound the whole thing like a quilt, and voila!  I hope that makes sense - much easier to show than to explain. If I ever make another one, I'll have to take pics and make a tutorial! ;)"

quilting,3a2672,multiverse4,4,Tue Jun 16 17:21:39 2015 UTC,I'd cover it with silk chiffon. It's very sheer. Just pick a color close to the most dominant color in your quilt and over sew it to the top. https://www.denverfabrics.com/c1038_apparel-fabric-silk-fabrics-silk-chiffon

quilting,3a2672,Anne314,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:25:28 2015 UTC,"I have done it before. I usually make wall-hangings with lots of embellishments and to keep the delicate ones on, I either cover the whole top, or just a piece of the top in chiffon and quilt it down. You can either use a color that blends into the background or a contrasting color to add a subtle bit of interest. If that seems like too much work for a quilt that wasn't made well to begin with, just use Steam-a-Seam to iron all the loose bits down."

How do you sew all the beautiful neutral lines that are presumably holding the front, stuffing and middle together?  It adds so much to the piece and mine are all either just wonky grids or trying to follow the lines on the front pattern but looking horrible on the back.  Sorry, silly question, I'm sure."
quilting,39xwhl,Egor_Wobble_Cox,2,Tue Jun 16 14:56:25 2015 UTC,"Hey fellow self-taught quilter!  I still consider myself mostly a novice, too.  What I've discovered is that basting is no joke.  When you finish your quilt top, and lay it over the backing and batting... Baste the shit out of it.  Pin that sucker every which way to sunday with safety pins - you can even get slightly bent ones that work really well for the job.  Resign yourself to slightly sore fingers after what feels like an ETERNITY of pinning.  Shitty quilting for me starts at half-assing the basting.  Once I've got that done, I do it all on my machine.  I used to work on a Brother ES-2000.  Now I work on a vintage machine from the 30's!  She's a singer 201-2 and she does a SPECTACULAR, reliable job.  I put a free-motion foot on there (or not) and go to town.  This particular quilt required NO free-motion quilting.  I hand drew on the fancy stuff in advance in pencil (praying that it would wash out afterwards - but that chalk stuff is for the birds. Drew a pattern on an entire quilt top in chalk once only to be reminded that chalk poofs off in a cloud of broken dreams if you move it around too much.) and then ran the straight stitch over the whole thing one little motif at a time.  This time I was trying to learn how to do a fancier, regulated, planned out design featured on the white space.  So I did.  The more you quilt, the better you'll get, I promise.  Keep up the wonky grids, and eventually they'll just be boring old grids.  Keep on truckin'.  :)"

She loved quilting, and I thought I would post this picture of the first full quilt she ever made.  This quilt was made for my wife while she was in high school. The appliqués all have to do with hobbies or nicknames for my wife - she was a drummer, etc. My wife actually helped her with some of the hand quilting, and they would work together while watching movies.  One day, when the quilt was all done except for the donkey tail, my wife decided that it was finally time to come out to her mom as a lesbian. She expected her mom would be supportive, but these things are always hard, especially as a teenager. She told her in the morning on the way to school, and they laughed and hugged.   When my wife got home from school that day, she found the finished quilt on her bed - with a rainbow ribbon added to the tail.

quilting,39wdw9,simplerthings,2,Mon Jun 15 10:02:30 2015 UTC,I have another issue on my first quilt. :)  I'm in the process of quilting and I just noticed that a seam between two small pieces opened up so now there's a bit of a pocket. Should I just pin the pieces down to the batting+backing and vigorously quilt over it?   I thought about trying to hand sew the two pieces back together but I can't imagine how I would do it without flipping the seam to the outside.
quilting,39wdw9,jawberwookie,4,Mon Jun 15 16:44:08 2015 UTC,maybe try a ladder type/invisible stitch by hand? Someone suggested it to me for binding and it was amazing.  I'm sure you could apply it to this scenario since it's the same principle concept. Especially if it's just a very small pocket. That way you can make a quick and effective fix and keep on going!  Here's a tutorial if that helps! http://www.instructables.com/id/Hand-Sewing-Basic-Slip-Stitch-Blind-Stitch/  http://www.connectingthreads.com/tutorials/Binding_Basics-Part_5_Hand-Stitching_the_Binding_to_the_Back__D102.html  Anyone feel free to correct me if i'm wrong!
quilting,39wdw9,SandyQuilter,4,Mon Jun 15 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"I think it kind of depends on how big the new ""pocket"" is. If it could be covered by just a couple of quilting stitches, that would be fine. Otherwise, I think /u/jawberwookie has a great idea about using a blind hand stitch to reattach those two pieces, then quilt as you were planning to. Good luck and remember, these aren't ""mistakes."" They are ""opportunities to get even more creative!"" :-)"

(Was supposed to be a first anniversary gift...that was several years ago)  He has picked the velvet fabric and I made the back piece from brocade but now I'm too scared to work on it.    I was thinking a simple pattern for the top, let the colors of the velvet be the focus.  I have black, ruby, emerald, etc for the colors.  Maybe Around the World or Triangle?  I can't find any information on why mixing a pieced velvet top wont work with a light-weight brocade back but I've never made a king size quilt before and all my other quilts were made from cottons or denims.  What about the batting? And the quilting itself?  Tying it seems like sacrilege on such a beautiful fabric so I will have to have it machine quilted, right?  I have also never worked with velvet before.  So..... can I just cut out the triangles and start sewing or is there more too it?  The binding is going to be a satin that he also picked out, which I've also never done before.  I've only ever used quilt binding or pulled the back sheet over to the front and overlapped to make the border and edge.  TL;DR: bit off more than I can chew with fancy fabric."
quilting,39wdw9,SandyQuilter,3,Mon Jun 15 10:44:06 2015 UTC,"The other thing to be conscious of is the direction of the velvets. Remember that velvet has a nap, so if you place some of the fabrics ""upside down,"" you will have more texture to your quilt. It's not a BAD thing, but just something to keep in mind. You might be OK with a scrappy look, or you might want to make sure all the nap is going in the same direction in alternating rows, or you might want it all in the same direction on the whole thing. Whatever you choose, I bet it's going to be gorgeous and I can't wait to see what you do!"

You might find information by searching velvet crazy quilts any of them use brocades and other heavier type fabric, albeit in small pieces but in theory the info will work.  Def also plan I machine quilting. Long arm all the way.  Be sure your velvet is cotton - and they may charge you differently  To me- if he wants ""heavy"" - to me that equals warm.  I would use two layers of wool.  100% wool, especially if the velvet is cotton.  Looking forward to progress pics - you'll be fine, just don't let the fabrics intimidate you- they're still cotton!!!!!"

The brocade on the back is something I'd be most worried about.  As a longarm quilter myself, having thick velvet, with seams plus a brocade may cause trouble even on a longarm.  I know you didn't want to tie, but considering the thickness you might want to reconsider.  Tiying can be lovely with a pearl cotton thread.    Can't wait to see it!"

quilting,39wdw9,Siamsa,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:01:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to do a simple pieced backing for my first quilt. Basically, I have one large piece of cloth that's not quite wide enough, so I'm going to add a couple of panels of white fabric in to make an off-center cross/window pane kind of shape.  My question is this: I've seen some people say that the fabric grain for backing can matter a lot for how puckered or smooth your quilting turns out. Is it very important to make sure that both my main backing fabric and my inserted panels run in the same direction - i.e., both running cross grain, or along the grain? Or can I just be very careful when piecing and basting, and cut the fabric whatever way works best?"

I'm currently only making quilts with what I have in my ""stash"" or have been given.  I didn't worry at all about making sure the extras were running cross grain or along grain. I spray basted all 3 quilts really well & did mostly straight line quilting (some S.I.D.) & not one issue with puckering. Two of the lap quilts were approximately 54'x64' & one was 56'x70'."

I've been sewing simple projects for at least 15 years, and feel fairly confident that I can take this on.  I'm planning to use this tutorial as a guide, but was wondering...  I don't plan to make quilting an actual hobby (I already have too many creative hobbies that I really just don't have time or money for another), so I'd like to avoid investing in things I'm only going to use once.  Do you think, if I used fusible batting, I could avoid having to purchase a walking foot and special pins?  It's not going to be a very large quilt since it's for a nursery, so I'm hoping that I could skip some purchases by getting the fusible batting.  Thanks for your advice!"
quilting,39wdw9,K1W1Chick,2,Tue Jun 16 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"Short answer is yes. You can quilt without a walking foot & special pins. You need to lengthen your stitch & go a lot slower than with a walking foot as you don't want it to bunch up under your foot & end up with puckers. I've done it; when I first started out quilting, I didn't have a walking foot for my machine but managed to complete some quilts. I personally didn't like the fusible batting as I found it difficult to work with & gummed up my needle.  I'd recommend getting a can of basting spray & using a nice cotton batting (JoAnns has a 60% off coupon this week & a 15% off total purchase coupon).   http://www.joann.com/warm-and-natural-baby-size/11554391.html  http://www.joann.com/june-tailor-quilt-basting-spray-10-oz/4811204.html  Spray basting a quilt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VWvojG2mK0  To make a baby quilt even easier, you could look at panels or kits such as this:   https://www.fabric.com/buy/0349262/dr-seuss-abc-24-panel-adventure  http://www.keepsakequilting.com/seek-and-find-abc-kit  Hope that some of this helps you to make a quilt for your SIL soon to be niece.

Basting spray should work easily on a small project and not shift on you. The biggest challenge you will have though is quilting it without a walking foot. Walking feet are useful for more than just quilting though. If you ever do any crafts where you need to sew multiple layers of fabric together a walking foot could be helpful. Also, depending on your machine you can get them cheap. The one for the cheap Singer I had I bought at JoAnn's for something like $25 without coupons. Brother walking feet shouldn't be expensive either. What brand machine do you have?"

Quilting Bee - There are a couple of definitions for this. The first, more traditional one, was that a community's quilters would come together to work on quilts together. Think of several women sitting around a large hand-quilting frame, and you have the idea.   With the advent of the internet, a different sort of bee became very popular. Several quilters form a group that will sew for a pre-determined period of time (varies according to the group), and sew according to a theme, or prompt for the month. The theme or prompt is usually set by that month's Queen/King Bee, or the person who will be receiving all the blocks sewn that month. The idea is that each person in the group will be the queen/king bee once, and get enough blocks to either finish a lap-sized quilt, or have a good start on a larger one. The blocks are usually mailed to the queen/king bee, as quilters participating in the bee can be spread across several states/provinces/countries.  Round Robin Quilts - Round robin quilt are long-term projects, typically done with a group of quilters. Each quilter sews up a start to their quilt top, typically a centerpiece, like a medallion quilt. The quilt top is then sent to the next quilter in the group, who adds a border to complement the center. The quilt top is then sent to the next quilter, and then the next, etc... Until it's visited with each quilter in the group. The idea is that the original quilter will receive a completed quilt top that they can then quilt as desired.  I'm actually in a round robin group now. The work I've done on each person's quilt can be seen at Threadbias. I will be receiving a quilt top to work on each month through November. The idea was that each person would specify what they liked, what they hate, what fabrics are welcome, which are forbidden, and a theme for their quilt top. We have one individual wanting a modern sampler, done mostly in shades of orange. Another's theme is farm life. A couple of us just made centers, specified what we absolutely hate, and then said, ""Have fun, otherwise!"""
quilting,39wdw9,Toolzie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:44:11 2015 UTC,Wow thanks so much for your reply! Round robin sounds awesome! I'll have to find one and get in on it!
quilting,39wdw9,Grymalcyn,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:15:53 2015 UTC,"If you're active on Instagram, most swaps seems to have migrated there. I haven't looked for a round robin hash tag, yet, but I'm trying to avoid joining more groups - I'm working six days a week right now, and don't want to promise too much of my time.   Otherwise, several groups used to be advertised at the Flickr group Quilting Bee Blocks. With the transition of so many users to Instagram, though, I don't know how active it is."

quilting,39wdw9,thrownormanaway,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:32:04 2015 UTC,"I have just this week cut all my fabric for a quilt I'm making for my sister, it's my very first quilt (indeed, first fabric based craft) ever! Any how, I mis-meadured all 256 half square triangles I cut. All too late, I found out about the calculation where you add 7/8"" to whatever your finished edge measurement should be. I foolishly thought it was just the regular add a half inch deal like with say, a square you would make. I used this technique but obvs missed the memo on the 7/8"" stuff. To salvage my work (and increase accuracy of the finished blocks of course) I've been squaring the blocks down to 3.5"" square, but I'm losing rather a lot of fabric per square. I'm already committed, and since all my pieces are the same, though an odd measurement, I should be OK.   But would there have been a better way to fix my mistake?   Also, when it comes to adding a border to this sucker, would it be weird to add a thick border on top and bottom and a thin one of the same fabric on the sides? I'm not working with a pattern (lol, again, first timer mistakes) and I desperately don't want to have to piece more of these blocks, so I'd rather add length with a thick border, plus I like the way those look. Is there a better way to do that in lieu of the excessive border size?"
quilting,39wdw9,Melvarine,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"Bummer about all of those triangles! You should be ok making the top & bottom boarders different from the sides. Just keep ratio in mind, for example 6"" & 3"", or 4"" & 2"" to keep things balanced."

quilting,39uxwg,youGotToBeQuiltingMe,6,Mon Jun 15 00:26:05 2015 UTC,"Put a strip of fabric on the back and use some fabric glue (Fabri-Tac) and butt the edges together and glue it to the strip.  It might be a little stiff, but it should hold. Zigzagging over the cut might be added insurance."
quilting,39uxwg,Spokeswoman,5,Mon Jun 15 03:27:10 2015 UTC,"You could get some lightweight fusible interfacing. Put both parts of your triangle together on top of the interfacing and press well. Then do the zig-zag technique mentioned here and it should be OK. When quilting it, be sure to pay some extra attention to that area, just to be on the safe side. Maybe could you even use that block to applique something like your label or a note to your daughter? Just to ""hide"" the oops."
quilting,39uxwg,SandyQuilter,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:26:20 2015 UTC,Oh interfacing is a good idea. I'll practice with some I have and see.  Thanks!
quilting,39uxwg,thatbitchattheIRS,3,Mon Jun 15 17:35:52 2015 UTC,"I would shove it together and zig zag it.  Can't seam it, you'll loose the 1/4"" in the seam.   Then..... Maybe try to use it on a corner or at least not in the middle of the pattern.     It's heart wrenching - I've been there."
quilting,39uxwg,thatbitchattheIRS,2,Mon Jun 15 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I can try that.  Unfortunately it is a giant pattern, so everything is essentially right in the middle.  I'm worried about it fraying in the wash if I do that.  It's a quilt for my young daughter so will definitely need some washes. I do have some scraps,so could I possibly use those to patch? I can do it over, as long at I can find the fabric. It was at JoAnns but quite a while ago, so I'm concerned I'd they'd still have it."
quilting,39uxwg,-cc0unt-nt,4,Mon Jun 15 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"I would do the zigzag pretty close and co over it a few times.  But, if you have scraps that you could price s new price together- no one will ever notice he seams in that one HST.  You will know it's there but consider it your humility block, like the Amish !   Prob better to sib thus than the zigzag if you have the scraps- especially since it's going to be washed considerably more than normal in the next few years."
quilting,39uxwg,SandyQuilter,3,Mon Jun 15 02:34:46 2015 UTC,"Can you explain what a humility block is? Is that like, an imperfect block to remind us quilters that we are still humans despite our talents making big, beautiful fabric sandwiches of love that keep all the people warm and cozy?"
quilting,39uxwg,thatbitchattheIRS,2,Mon Jun 15 14:19:06 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what it is. Rumor has it that the Amish purposely put a ""mistake"" in each of their quilts because ""only God is perfect."""
quilting,39uxwg,kateyj,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:24:12 2015 UTC,Exactly!!
quilting,39uxwg,K1W1Chick,4,Tue Jun 23 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"If you post a photo of the fabric, someone here might have a scrap that they would send you to remake that block. If I have it, I will send it."
quilting,39uxwg,gorramquilts,2,Mon Jun 15 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"If you can't fix it at all & don't get any more fabric, to save the quilt you can always put some sort of applique over the cut. I've done this before & it looked as though it was meant to be there.  Good luck."

quilting,39tzin,vfrcdexsw,5,Sun Jun 14 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"That would make a beautiful center-block in a quilt, but I think it would be perfect for a pillow. I suspect your sixth-grade self knew that you didn't always finish projects, so you may have intentionally started this for a smaller item. If you don't like the pillow idea, maybe it could be adapted for use as a tea cozy or wall hanging?"
quilting,39tzin,ColonialChicken,4,Sun Jun 14 22:06:13 2015 UTC,I love the idea of a little wall hanging.  Such a pretty little block!
quilting,39tzin,Goldie2000,3,Mon Jun 15 02:37:18 2015 UTC,"It seems like an isolated piece--I have a few other projects but my grandma and I seemed to have collected all the pieces we would need for each one, and this doesn't have any coordinating block-sized fabric. I like the idea of a pillow. Just finished quilting it, so I'll look into how to finish it (do you have any resources offhand?)."
quilting,39tzin,ColonialChicken,3,Mon Jun 15 04:36:56 2015 UTC,"I don't have any resources to direct you to specifically, but if the piece is completely quilted, it should be easy enough. Any online pillow cover tutorial should work out nicely. Just treat the finished quilted block as the front piece of material in the pattern. I'd look for one that is intended for a removable pillow cover with a zipper or other closure in the back. (Your quilting is lovely, and having the ability to remove and wash the cover may come in handy.)  You're fortunate that the dimensions correspond to a standard pillow size as well! Most craft and sewing stores stock 18"" square forms."
quilting,39tzin,andrea_r,4,Mon Jun 15 07:47:30 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's a pillow top. :)  My grandmother also taught me to quilt, and we did a few small projects together. Luckily when I inherited her UFO's most were also bundled with whatever pattern was followed.  Since then, I actually bag my UFO's with a pattern and if there's none, an actual worksheet. Which, given my memory these days is helping me too. :D (in the WTF was I thinking parts)"
quilting,39tzin,SandyQuilter,3,Mon Jun 15 11:04:19 2015 UTC,"It looks great! And I agree with the others, that turning it into a pillow is a great idea. Really, all you'd need to do is get a coordinating fabric (even a fat quarter would work) and a pillow form and you'd be set!   I'd also maybe attach a label to the back of the pillow explaining what drove you to finish the project (using a lot of your explanation above) to help encourage your 6th-grade granddaughters to document whatever projects you end up working on together."
quilting,39tnv8,downeasttraditions,3,Sun Jun 14 17:48:22 2015 UTC,"I have a Gammill Premier from 1999 that I purchased used about a year ago. It isn't stitch regulated, no channel lock, no bells and whistles. Just a basic workhorse of a machine. I love it.  If there's any advice I can give you, I would just say- you don't need bells and whistles. I know when you (general you) look around and see what's out there it's easy to feel like you HAVE to have all these features, but you don't. They don't make you a better quilter, they just make some aspects easier. The only thing that makes you better is practice.   Anyway, try out a bunch of machines because they all ride differently, find what you like, and sure- get the best machine you can afford. Good luck! :)"

quilting,39tnv8,gorramquilts,2,Tue Jun 16 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"I would suggest making sure whomever you buy it from offers awesome support. I bought mine (Tin Lizzie) from a local dealer and the thing never worked right. It was part issues with the machine and part the trainer (she told me to put in the bobbin backwards... took them a year to realize that was an issue, FML), but long story short, the shop offered really poor support and I kept having to call TL who would call the shop who would then grudgingly come to my house and say ""it's fine"" when they looked at the machine. Very frustrating waste of money.   Definitely make sure you get great support. And it doesn't necessarily have to be a local shop. A friend bought a Handiquilter, no local dealer, but HQ offers amazing support."
quilting,39tnv8,Goldie2000,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:07:58 2015 UTC,Your experience is pretty much what I've heard all around.  Tin Lizzie's can be a nightmare (but they are affordable) and Handiquilter has really stepped up their game.  I'm almost willing to put Handiquilter in with the Big Four as they have come so far.  They've got some high end professionals using them (including Kim Brunner) and that's impressive more than anything!
quilting,39tnv8,gorramquilts,3,Wed Jun 17 13:09:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was super disappointing because when I was trying machines, I loved it.   I would suggest investigating HQ. I've only heard good things about them. My friend with the HQ ended up becoming a rep and traveling teacher for them because she loved her machine and the company so much."
quilting,39tnv8,Goldie2000,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:37:54 2015 UTC,"It used to be you only heard so so things about them, but the last few years they've come out with better machines and a ton of rep support, Im really impressed."
quilting,39tnv8,Grymalcyn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"I would totally agree with /u/SnarkleSparkle: Try several machines, see what works for you, and get the best machine you can afford.  I'd also make sure to get a frame that suits the largest quilt you see yourself making. I purchased a Little Gracie II with a Janome 6600 once upon a time, and quickly found that I'd outgrown the frame... It could only take up to a queen sized quilt, and I could only quilt an area of 4"" x the width of the quilt before needing to roll the quilt up some more.   This doesn't work for me, at all... I usually produce king-sized quilt tops, and use blocks that are large than 4"" in size. Thankfully, I have a friend who has access to a mid-arm, but I'm definitely on the lookout to purchase a frame and setup for my own home."
quilting,39tnv8,Goldie2000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:48:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I routinely make king size quilts. A while back I was looking at a Little Gracie II for my Janome 1600P, but came to the same conclusion you did: I would need more throat space.  Near as I can figure, the machine I'm looking for has at least an 18 inch throat, like the Artistic Liberty or the HQ Avante, and a stitch regulator. Beyond that, it's gravy. :)"
quilting,39tnv8,andrea_r,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:47:04 2015 UTC,"I have an A1 with a stitch regulator.  I absolutely love this machine.  Smoothest carriage out there!  When I was looking, I lurked on forums and mailing lists and listed to the issues with each machine.  I attended every conference I could to try them all out.  All the machines are different and fit a person differently, so take the time to find the right one for you!  I also agree that you should get the best longarm you can afford.  It is a case of ""you get what you pay for"".  I started with a really low end longarm and it was all right but the tension issues on it were super frustrating.  I upgraded to the A1 and it was night and day!  On the A1 I can use any thread I want, flawlessly, every time.  If you do as much quilting as I do, that is huge!  Consider, too, any machine rep you will be working with.  With dedicated longarm dealers like Gammil or A1, your rep will be super schooled on its in and outs.  With dealers like Babylock or Janome you may not have that kind of support as long arms aren't their sole focus.  Just something to consider.  I love long arming and am always excited when I see another person considering the big leap to purchase one.  I hope you find your dream machine and I look forward to seeing your work posted here!"
quilting,39tnv8,Goldie2000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"I figure I'm 2-5 years from purchase so I'm still in that lurking phase myself. :D  Although given my location (no dealers, no near conferences) it's likely I'll get a used one from someone local. :/"
quilting,39tnv8,andrea_r,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:52:03 2015 UTC,"So don't worry about your location too much.  My A1 rep lives 120 miles away, but she came down, set up the machine and spent several hours making sure I knew how to run it.  I know Gammil reps do the same as well as Innova.  Some of the lower end machines don't have this kind of coverage, but they will have good documentation on setting it up."
quilting,39tnv8,Goldie2000,3,Mon Jun 15 16:04:57 2015 UTC,"Closest Gammil rep to me is in Ontario. :/ But it looks like they will come all the way here (I'm n NB), so yay.  The closest Innova dealer is in New Hampshire if I want a US one, but the closest Canadian one is in Alberta. FUN.  There's also a Pfaff dealer about 2 hrs away and it looks like they now do longarms too?  I'm kinda half hoping that when I'm ready to jump in, one of the local ladies will retire and she can just.. train me? :D"
quilting,39tnv8,andrea_r,2,Mon Jun 15 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"You would not be the first to take over someone's business/longarm!  I think that's a great way to go.  I don't want to knock Pfaff, as I really like their sewing machines, but their longarm does not have the best rep.  Just a heads up.  The Grand Quilter I wouldn't touch, but I don't know anything about their Power Quilter."
quilting,39tnv8,Goldie2000,2,Tue Jun 16 14:55:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd definitely want to have a machine that was from a longarm-only company. Just because it seems to make the most sense.
quilting,39tnv8,Drpepperholik,2,Tue Jun 16 16:17:01 2015 UTC,"Sadly the nearest A1 and Gammil rep is three states over from me, but I do have a good relationship with the Janome dealer in the next town over. They've been servicing my little guy (re: normal sewing machine) for quite some time now. It's one of the reasons I'm trying to find out as much as I can about their long arm offerings.  There is an Innova rep in the vicinity! Thank you for the tip about them!"

quilting,39iwhw,Grymalcyn,2,Fri Jun 12 01:05:01 2015 UTC,"Slowly working my way through previous projects, one per week.  The top and backing were entirely scrappy. I manage my scraps by cutting them into squares measuring 2.5"", 3"", and 5"". Anything remaining after is cut into strips, or used to make 'found fabric'. This top was made when I realized I have a lot of pre-cut scrap squares.   This made piecing the piecing the top extremely quick. All in all, this quilt took less time than others, because I finally got up the gumption to use a friend's mid-arm machine."

Throw pillows or tote bags might be a better use for this type of fabric. Of course, some upholstery fabrics are polished cotton and those might wash up ""ok."" Do a test perhaps?  I think you're smart to want to tie it rather than use your machine to quilt it. There is a nice cotton yarn that is kind of shiny and soft to the touch that I would recommend for that, but of course I can't remember the name of it now ..."

You have some really big areas that don't have any quilting in them.  Each batting is different, so check the package, but battings need stitching every 4""-10"" (again, check the package).  If large areas are left un-quilted, the batting can break and bunch.  I'd hate to see that happen to this awesome quilt!  You could easily add some big X's or just straight lines to those areas.

But, with my parent's quilt, I'm going to playing with HSTs, something I haven't gotten a lot of practice with.  And with the other I am using another technique that is new to me.

quilting,39a7ul,rumpkus,6,Wed Jun 10 10:56:50 2015 UTC,"When I moved to Seattle and had to find a new longarmer, I had a bunch of quilts I liked but weren't my masterpieces. I gave them to each of the quilters as a test (and for the few that got a little messed up, it wasn't a big deal). That helped me find the gal that I love up here and am confident giving her my fancier quilts.   This is a personal preference, for the masterpieces, I would also suggest finding a local quilter. I mailed a quilt and the post office didn't update the tracking information and it wasn't delivered on the day that it was supposed to be and I almost had a heart attack. It showed up the next day (the quilt was delivered at 4 PM and then USPS started adding tracking information, delivery backwards to shipment -_- ), but that is a horrible, horrible feeling."
quilting,39a7ul,gorramquilts,5,Wed Jun 10 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"Gorgeous! As a long arm quilter, things that make quilting easier: make sure your back is bigger than your quilt. We recommend 10 inches bigger (so an 80x90 quilt ideally has a 90x100 back). Press well! My favorite customers come in with a nicely starched quilt top. The seams stay flat and I never have problems with inadvertent wrinkles. Use good quality batting! I hate having a lovely quilt use super cheap poly batting. It has wrinkles that don't like to come out and it screws with my tension. Right now my favorite is Quilters Dream Wool. It's breathable, washable, has minimal shrinkage and a very nice loft without being heavy.    Otherwise, talk with you quilter. They should have pattern examples and samples of their work. Have an idea in mind for what you want and if you can't visualize anything, at least know what you don't want."
quilting,39a7ul,rhapsodyknit,2,Wed Jun 10 15:26:42 2015 UTC,"I have one package of batting that is very wrinkled. I put it in the dryer to help the wrinkles relax, but it didn't work. I am not sure what to do with it. Maybe iron it? It is 80/20 I think by looking at it. Do you have any suggestions?"
quilting,39a7ul,craftasaurus,2,Wed Jun 10 16:58:35 2015 UTC,"you can try hanging it ( over a railing or line) and spraying it so its lightly soaked (not dripping) with plain water. Honestly, I just try and smooth the wrinkles as well as I can while quilting. I don't get actual folds in the batting, just minute tension issues. Sometimes, it's hard to load onto the rack. Otherwise, I don't have the time to try and get all the wrinkles out. If you do try to iron, make sure your iron isn't screaming hot. You wouldn't want to take a chance of melting anything. (I just had a customer melt most of her piecing threads by using isacord to piece. Always use cotton for piecing!)"

quilting,39935f,SandyQuilter,5,Wed Jun 10 14:37:25 2015 UTC,I like that idea. It's not boring it's clean and graphic. I think that makes the look more powerful.  Is stitching in the ditch difficult/time consuming? I've always been intimidated by it.
quilting,39935f,moosemccutty,5,Wed Jun 10 14:42:41 2015 UTC,"I think STID (Stitch in the Ditch) is easy. Yes, you can drive yourself crazy if you feel the need to be ""perfect,"" but if you go off the exact seam line a little bit, just ease your way back and NOBODY will notice. And if you choose a wavy / zig-zaggy kind of stitch that is SUPPOSED to meander a little bit, that gives you even more freedom (or room for error, if you think that way). And in my own little opinion, it will emphasize the graphic nature of your quilt.   Oh, and if you don't have any plans for the future of your quilt, I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE it ... (hint, hint).

I just did a similar one (nowhere near as perfect as yours!!) and I actually had planned on just outlining the zig-zag seams with 1/4 in on each side, but since my points etc were way off, i just did the vertical seams (you look like you would n't have to do all of them,depending how big your blocks are!), which ended up looking nice and not taking away much of the attention from the actual piecework!"

quilting,392ty0,tattooedinthecity,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:13:25 2015 UTC,"You'll probably want to look for a machine that has at least 5x7"" as most designs that can be imported are for 5x7"" or larger these days. You might be able to ""rehoop"" it with the help of placement guides but it gets tricky if you really wanted to go no bigger than 4x4.   Also just know it takes a variety of stabilizers depending on what you're working on and a selection of generally pricey thread. Hope that helps!"
quilting,392ty0,dirtypineapple,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"So buying the machine itself is only part of the cost of doing machine embroidery.  Other things you will need:   Stabilizer - there are tons of different types depending on the project you are working on Thread - again... tons of brands and types and each spool can cost $4 or more Blanks - the items you put the designs on Designs - Designs can range anywhere from .50 to over $20 each. You need to make sure you purchase the correct filetype for the machine you are using so it can read it.  Hoops - most machines come with one or two hoops but if it can do a variety of sizes you might need some other hoops (saves on stabilizer if you have a good hoop size so you don't have to do a small design in a giant hoop) Scissors, tweezers, needles, thread holders, basting spray, hooping tools - a ton of extras add up quickly  Embroidery software - at the very least you will need to invest in a program that can merge files together (so you can add a name to another design or something similar) and convert to the filetype for your machine. A basic software program is anywhere from $100-200. If you want to digitize your own designs plan on spending over $1k for software.    I recommend buying an embroidery machine from a dealer so you can take classes.  This is not a hobby easily learned on your own. There are great books you can read through and they might be available at your local library so I definitely recommend reading up before making your machine purchase.    For the machine itself buy the largest hoop size you can afford right now.  Mine does an 8x10 and there have been times I wish it could do 12x12 but it doesn't go that big since 8x10 is the maximum hoop size. I'd hate to be limited to a 5x7 or a 4x4 size.   Good brands: Brother, Pfaff, Babylock.  Find a used machine that has been well taken care of and save a bundle. I bought mine used and it works like a dream.  Test drive several and have them show you the machine actually doing stitch outs.   A decent machine that can do a good size will cost you between $1,000 - $1,500.  The extra stuff you need to get started will likely be around $500-700 on top of that."

I have several ideas for quilts but Joann's and my local fabric shops leave me feeling very whitebread american.

quilting,390g0i,simplerthings,3,Mon Jun 8 16:50:48 2015 UTC,I was quilting for the first time last night and when I got  near an edge the backing fabric folded over to the back and I quilted a small chunk of it. here's a picture   What's the best way to fix this? I thought of just cutting off most of the fabric and leaving that small triangle inside. Or if I go at it with my seam ripper will the rest of the thread fall out and cause my quilt to come apart?
quilting,390g0i,-yvette-,6,Sat Jun 13 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't leave the fabric in. You'll always notice it and thus be happier fixing it. Just rip the stitches, straighten it out and quilt over that triangle again, with maybe an inch into the part you do not have to rip out. The inch is plenty and more than enough, i usually do 1-2 cm. As long as there's a decent overlap in stitching, the quilt will surely not come apart.   It's the same when your bobbin runs out while quilting: just go over that last inch where it was still gripping the top thread and you're good to go! We've all been there :)"

I'm also not set on a way to book-bind this into shape :) I've read many tutorials which do different ways and I will choose this evening, but if somebody has done this before and knows what NOT to do, I'd be happy to know before i start :)  EDIT: THANK YOU ALL for your ideas and help! I've started making it today and am near finished already. This time around I left the crackly part out and just did a soft book.

quilting,390g0i,georockgeek,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:13:41 2015 UTC,If you only did a single layer of chip bag (so it couldn't get water stuck inbetween 2 layers It shouldn't be a problem with other items in the washing machine. Wash the chip bag with dawn or other degreaser should get all the oils off of the bag. I bet cellophane from a party store would work great too and you would have to degrease it.
quilting,390g0i,Drpepperholik,2,Tue Jun 9 01:49:37 2015 UTC,I have those crackle books for my son and they aren't quilted. It's just fabric with the crackle material between the layers. You could maybe quilt the covers and do the pages with the crackle. I don't know what you mean by transparencies because I think of the stiffer clear sheets that teachers used to use on the overhead projectors when I was in school (yeah...that makes me feel old to say that) but I found this which might be what you're looking for. If that's the stuff I'd like to know myself so I can make one of these books!

quilting,390g0i,-yvette-,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:52:12 2015 UTC,Also interesting! I guess I'll have to do a series of experiments.

quilting,390g0i,SandyQuilter,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"When I worked in a quilt shop, we did not do that detailed type of cutting. Partly because we didn't have time and partly because if one of the squares was just a teench off it could mess up the whole design and that wasn't a responsibility we were willing to take on. That being said, in my opinion, a teench off doesn't make or break a project. But to some people, it would."

quilting,38zbou,jmedk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:20:23 2015 UTC,I just sorta made it up as I went along. This was only my second quilt ever. My favorite part was the custom quilting I did. I really wish I had remembered photos :(

quilting,38yy53,tz67,3,Mon Jun 8 01:42:48 2015 UTC,"First, let me express my deepest sympathies to you and your friend's family.  I can't begin to imagine what you are feeling or going through right now.  Take a break from the quilt if it is too emotionally hard to work on it.  If I were in your shoes, I would probably keep the quilt in memory of my friend.  Or I would do as others have said and give it to her parents in memory of their daughter.  I made a quilt for my uncle and delivered it just a month before he died.  Now my cousin (dearest friend of mine) has the quilt and treasures it.  Just make sure that whoever you choose to give it to, that they will treasure it as much as your friend would have."
quilting,38yy53,SandyQuilter,2,Mon Jun 8 13:41:34 2015 UTC,I am SO sorry for your loss. The quilt is beautiful and I bet she would really have loved it. I think your idea of maybe giving it to her parents (when you are ready) is lovely. I'm crying for you right now.
quilting,38yy53,craftasaurus,2,Mon Jun 8 02:05:13 2015 UTC,"Saying that it sucks does not even begin to address the horrific reality of the situation. Soooo sorry for your loss, and that of her family and friends. The quilt is absolutely gorgeous, so I'm sure somebody will love it in time, if you decide to finish it. It looks to me like it says ""love, love, LOVE"". Best Wishes!"
quilting,38yy53,-yvette-,2,Mon Jun 8 14:41:57 2015 UTC,I'm deeply sorry for your loss. It's totally understandable you can't continue right now. But i hope you'll someday find the strength to continue and remember her by it. Love and hugs.

quilting,38yy53,7daph7,3,Mon Jun 8 01:34:20 2015 UTC,finish have her name quilted into it and donate it to a cause in her name   Sorry for your pain. She can be your quilting angel bring you inspiration
quilting,38yy53,Justicepirate,2,Mon Jun 8 04:47:20 2015 UTC,"She owned a very popular restaurant here in town, so I'm thinking of stitching the logo in the middle and recipes around it or at least soup names. Then I think I'm going to donate it to the restaurant and let them either display it or auction it off for charity, that way the money can be used to help someone else (as my friend helped so many people as often as she could)."
quilting,38y6co,NormanIsMyHero,10,Sun Jun 7 21:10:14 2015 UTC,You don't HAVE to finish it.  You can add it to a huge pile of unfinished projects like many of the rest of us.

quilting,38y6co,Bels_Alexis,3,Sun Jun 7 22:12:04 2015 UTC,I've found that the best motivation to getting a quilt done is to make it a gift that has a deadline :)

quilting,38y6co,-cc0unt-nt,3,Sun Jun 7 22:17:27 2015 UTC,I did do!  And as far as I'm concerned.  The quilting is done now.
quilting,38y6co,rumpkus,2,Mon Jun 8 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"Yaay! Good work! The rectangles look just fine. The pattern is stunning enough, there was no need for fancy, time-consuming quilting."

quilting,38y6co,tz67,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:37:48 2015 UTC,Thanks. You are way too kind.  I assure you that there is plenty of imperfect squares once one gets up close.
quilting,38y6co,Justicepirate,2,Mon Jun 8 01:09:01 2015 UTC,"Do NOT point that out to the bride and groom. Or anyone else, for that matter. Just say, ""Thank you,"" when people tell you how beautiful it is. OK? Promise?"
quilting,38y6co,SandyQuilter,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:02:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't worry. I won't point it out the bride. (I've actually never met the groom but that happens when you live half a continent away.)    But I'll definitely have a chat with my mom about how I can do stuff better and what I've learned with this one, while at the same time encouraging her to finish off all of her unfinished craft projects now that she won't be doing a bunch of DIY wedding crafts.  For example, squaring up the blocks goes a far way in making the finished product look damn good.  Major lesson learned this time."
quilting,38y6co,SandyQuilter,2,Mon Jun 8 05:22:47 2015 UTC,"Beautiful!    What size is it? I have a twin size I need to quilt soon. I'm also starting a king size top, but I'll be sending that out to be quilted."

quilting,38xyzv,banana_007,3,Sun Jun 7 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"I love the colors. If it was me I would separate the squiggly fabric, because some of the squiggles don't line up. What if the fabrics go diagonally?"
quilting,38xyzv,quiltingismytherapy,2,Sun Jun 7 20:57:43 2015 UTC,Do you mean turn some of them like this?  http://imgur.com/pNtOXIU  Or something else? I kind of contemplated doing alternating diagonal rows starting from the corner. I'd have to lay it out and see if I have enough fabric though
quilting,38xyzv,quiltingismytherapy,2,Sun Jun 7 21:44:22 2015 UTC,What if you put the squiggly one where the solid maroon one is? I like the idea of alternating diagonal rows.
quilting,38xyzv,quiltingismytherapy,5,Sun Jun 7 22:09:57 2015 UTC,I think this is the one! I really like the diagonal rows.  http://imgur.com/ZijZGY0

quilting,38xyzv,thatbitchattheIRS,2,Mon Jun 8 15:05:40 2015 UTC,I like this one!
quilting,38xyzv,thatbitchattheIRS,3,Wed Jun 10 03:44:41 2015 UTC,I like the first choice but agree with /u/quiltingismytherapy that the squiggly fabric isn't as good since it doesn't line up to itself..... Spin them so they aren't going the same way and go for it!!!!   Def gorgeous flannels!!
quilting,38xyzv,Srace,2,Sun Jun 7 21:19:00 2015 UTC,Do you mean turn them like this? I agree that they don't match up and it bugged me. This breaks it up a little bit too and doesn't make it look so dizzy-fying.  http://imgur.com/pNtOXIU
quilting,38xyzv,Srace,2,Sun Jun 7 21:40:14 2015 UTC,exactly - - it's always amaazing to me how much one quick shift of a square can change the entire feeling of the top!  LOVE it now!
quilting,38xyzv,Emergency_Ward,2,Wed Jun 10 10:46:38 2015 UTC,"I love the colours and patterns, but don't really love the idea of grouping blocks of the same print together.  Diagonal rows sound awesome, or maybe swap two out of each of the big groupings of four and do a scrappy four patch, or even just do intentionally semi-random squares?  I think the raggy edges will work better if two squares of the same fabric aren't together, as the lighter fabrics will end up with very light/white edges."
quilting,38xyzv,Srace,4,Sun Jun 7 22:34:47 2015 UTC,I really like the way the rows came out. I was definitely over thinking this.   http://imgur.com/ZijZGY0

quilting,38vphl,Melvarine,2,Sun Jun 7 11:17:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I didn't FMQ before I added the appliqué, I added those first to one big piece of Kona cotton and then FMQ around them once the quilt was basted. I considered FMQ the deer in brown because he's so large but then I thought about those small antlers and the chances of me buggering it up and I decided not to."

And please, if you are cutting a lot of minky, wear a respirator (you can get a cheap one from Lowes/Home Depot).

quilting,38vphl,GrimmLo,2,Sun Jun 7 17:58:39 2015 UTC,"So true! I'm making a quilt for my step-daughter's new baby and it's all hand-cut appliqué minky roses. Petal by petal. It looks like it's snowing pink and yellow minky snow in my studio right now.   EDIT: Aside from the shedding (and it's not as bad as a true faux fur or anything) it's not hard to work with. It's very durable, shrinks minimally or not at all, and it's colorfast. It only sheds when it's cut, too, so it's not shedding all over the place once it's secured."

quilting,38uw3k,SandyQuilter,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:45:16 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I think my seam allowances were a bit too big so it ended up a little on the small side. That was my test block so if my HSTs end up too small again I may scale it down to everything is even. But that is going to take some hard math!

quilting,38mb4d,Grymalcyn,4,Fri Jun 5 03:27:28 2015 UTC,"Finished piecing the top in November 2013, but it sat, waiting to be quilted for quite a while. I finally did that in February this year.  I worked from Camille Roskelley's Swoon pattern. At the time I did my piecing, the pattern was only available for 24"" finished blocks, but I sized it down to 16"" and added sashing. I used Kona Coal, my favorite grey fabric for the sashing and background, and a mix of pink, yellow and orange fabrics from several different lines. I backed the quilt with three fabrics, and quilted it up on a friend's mid-arm machine."
quilting,38mb4d,Telsarin,3,Fri Jun 5 03:49:14 2015 UTC,Great job
quilting,38mb4d,-yvette-,2,Fri Jun 5 04:43:07 2015 UTC,It's so cool that although no color is repeated everything fits perfectly!
quilting,38mb4d,Siamsa,2,Fri Jun 5 10:09:35 2015 UTC,"I love planned scrappy, and have plenty of fabric to use, so it was an easy choice to use coordinating, but different prints."
quilting,38i5rn,MsRatbag,9,Thu Jun 4 11:13:14 2015 UTC,Are you relatively new to quilting? There are some great videos on youtube about doing borders so that they aren't wavy and make the quilt lay flat.   https://youtu.be/MjPaLYcrJ24
quilting,38i5rn,sweetright,2,Thu Jun 4 14:26:09 2015 UTC,Not so much new as first attempt at mitred corners lol
quilting,38i5rn,sweetright,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:56:43 2015 UTC,Gotcha! I haven't tried that yet myself so I understand lol.
quilting,38i5rn,craftasaurus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:02:27 2015 UTC,I probably couldve laid it out a bit better too... was just a quick pic
quilting,38i5rn,lornad,6,Thu Jun 4 21:57:01 2015 UTC,Also making grandma some placemats that she doesn't know about. They will all be quilted differently but I only have a pic of one of them. Front: http://imgur.com/hBLzw5W Back: http://imgur.com/VSnEvjS
quilting,38i5rn,SomethingTurtle,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:15:35 2015 UTC,Sweet! Love your quilting. Looks like good practice. I finished something yesterday and got to practice my straight line quilting. Fun.
quilting,38i5rn,Tarsala3791,8,Thu Jun 4 14:04:57 2015 UTC,Making Grandma do the hard part?
quilting,38i5rn,SandyQuilter,9,Thu Jun 4 12:12:53 2015 UTC,She wanted to do the rest because its for my sister. I think hand stitching 700hexagons might have been the hard part
quilting,38jr14,jawberwookie,4,Thu Jun 4 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"So I've done many a BOM and they can be great!  The upside is that you often get step by step instructions, you know how it should turn out, and in your case, a progression of skill set.  The downside, really, is that you have to wait a month for the next block!  I stopped doing them, only for this reason - I wanted to progress faster on the quilt than the blocks allowed!  So anyways, thumbs up for BOMs here. :-)"
quilting,38jr14,Goldie2000,3,Thu Jun 4 20:17:36 2015 UTC,Thanks! That does seem like a downside but since I tend to rush things maybe that would be a good change of pace:)
quilting,38jr14,Goldie2000,2,Thu Jun 4 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"What I found interesting is I wound up starting new projects, and when the BOM came in, I would put aside with whatever I had completed so far.  Eventually, I got back to it but by this time all the blocks had come in.  I could complete it!  Comparing what I had done nearly a year prior, vs what I could do now was really awesome. I could see the progression in my piecing accuracy!"
quilting,38jr14,georockgeek,2,Thu Jun 4 21:33:09 2015 UTC,"I am doing a BOM right now through one of my Local places that is paper piecing. There is a monthly ""support group"" meeting where we get the next pattern and and buy the fabric kit if we want. It is a building skill set one this year, which I like since I have never done it before.  I'd say go for it if you like the quilt that you would be making. I look forward to getting the meeting/getting the next pattern and there are always other projects you can start/work on the rest of the month after you have finished the block."
quilting,38h01x,angelinetheballerine,2,Thu Jun 4 03:43:17 2015 UTC,"That is so pretty. Pink is MY color, so anything done in those tones catches my eye, but I really love this one. I think the black sashing really sets off those blocks so nicely. What size blocks did you make and how wide is your sashing? I have some fabric for a quilt for my daughter and I'm trying to decide what to do with it. I hope you don't mind that I may be ""borrowing"" your idea here ..."
quilting,38h01x,SandyQuilter,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:21:25 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! The blocks were 8x8in and I believe the sashing was about 2in wide. I was nervous that the solid pink blocks wouldn't match but I think it went together pretty well in the end :)
quilting,38h01x,SandyQuilter,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:35:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, it's perfect. Take a look at it in the thumbnail above and you can really see how those blocks all pop so nicely! Thanks for the dimension info."
quilting,38fw5k,wendymarie37,2,Wed Jun 3 23:09:24 2015 UTC,Seems tough to take a picture of a bigger quilt. Used light pink thread for the FMQ as suggested by somebody here. It came out just the way I'd hoped it would!
quilting,38fw5k,felixlgato,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:11:16 2015 UTC,The pink is perfect! I want a quilt just ike this one!
quilting,38fw5k,SandyQuilter,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:05:40 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely beautiful. And I loved your ""not so arty"" photo (in addition to the others). You should be very pleased with your efforts!"
quilting,38fw5k,bootiepie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:28:29 2015 UTC,"If only I could get my Christmas cactus to bloom, your beautiful blanket reminds me of my sad failures...;)"
quilting,38fw5k,bootiepie,2,Thu Jun 4 01:21:47 2015 UTC,Thanks...I think...  My lilacs bloomed this spring after 9 years of being just a plain shrub. Maybe there's hope for your cactus.
quilting,38fw5k,sweetdexterviking,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:49:30 2015 UTC,"Lol, I really like your quilt. :) funny part is I just found out I had a lilac bush too last yr when it bloomed... I just thought it was in over grown weed... nope, just an over grown lilac bush."
quilting,38fw5k,slamberina,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:50:11 2015 UTC,I like the choice of pink thread!
quilting,38gg25,craftasaurus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:16:43 2015 UTC,Very nice!
quilting,38glz4,ladybuglily,5,Thu Jun 4 01:59:05 2015 UTC,"I think you're over thinking this. Put the date you completed the quilt, and don't worry about them being ""late""."
quilting,38glz4,kimwim42,4,Thu Jun 4 02:11:45 2015 UTC,"Happy Third Birthday Sue Smith Love Always, Aunt Mary June 15, 2015"
quilting,38glz4,ExtraInvitation,3,Thu Jun 4 03:13:11 2015 UTC,"I kind of ran into this situation when I married my husband. There were already some grandkids in the family as well as some being born that year. I just put the date the quilts were done and let it go. Think of it this way - the 4YO isn't getting a BABY quilt, right, but a quilt appropriate to his/her age now. So that's the date that goes on it. /u/kimwim42 is kind of right - don't overthink it. ""It will be fine,"" as I like to say."
quilting,38glz4,SandyQuilter,2,Thu Jun 4 15:37:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm, okay.  I'm not really doing any of them as baby quilts.  They're kinda just...quilts.  I was thinking something like:  Made for   Name Name Name  on the occasion of his birth  Month Day Year  From Lily  Completed Month Year  What do you think?"
quilting,38glz4,SandyQuilter,3,Fri Jun 5 04:38:51 2015 UTC,"I think that would be great for all the ones being born from now on out. For the 4 who are already here, I would just change the ""On the occasion of his birth"" to ""Celebrating his birth"" (keeping those dates in there) and then you're safe.   Remember, whatever you put on there, they are going to LOVE that you spent the time and energy to make each of them a quilt. I promise they won't nitpick over the exact wording on the label. (And if they do, then they're a little too persnickety for my blood. LOL)"
quilting,38e9ar,magnoliafly,2,Wed Jun 3 17:17:54 2015 UTC,"This is an amazing idea. I don't have a ton of extra fabric, but I think I can put together a few blocks for this."
quilting,38e9ar,BecauseCaveCrickets2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:42:04 2015 UTC,I would love to make a block or two!
quilting,38gc6l,Synnful_me,2,Thu Jun 4 00:52:29 2015 UTC,Rather than printing them yourself I highly recommend having a service like Spoonflower or Fabric on Demand print them off.  You can arrange all the photos into a large file on Photoshop and use that to print them all on one yard of fabric with spacers so you can cut them apart.    They will last longer in washes being professionally printed onto fabric and look better.
quilting,38gc6l,magnoliafly,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:45:12 2015 UTC,What a great idea thank you!
quilting,38gc6l,gaylef,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:44:19 2015 UTC,We made fabric labels for using this method. They worked really well. Hope that helps. http://www.myrepurposedlife.com/2010/08/printing-on-fabric.html

quilting,38f054,carrighead,3,Wed Jun 3 19:51:46 2015 UTC,"I've used this tutorial on a jelly roll race quilt and really liked how it came out. It went by super fast, and since you're on a postage stamp quilt you have plenty of seams to use as guidelines."
