onejob,3e09rq,a_junebug,2,Tue Jul 21 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they mounted it too close to the actual light switch and now the remote covers the bottom of the switch. So you can't turn the switch off because the remote is keeping,g the botto, half of the switch pushed in the on position."
onejob,3e09rq,Kawsiphek,2,Tue Jul 21 09:03:54 2015 UTC,Actually when the remote is returned to the holster it forces the switch to turn off.  Almost seems genius to me.

It was being driven by a female who was not supposed to be driving, hence the reason they jumped out and switched really quick. The passenger told security he was the driver, but once they reviewed this footage they saw he clearly wasn't. They were both fired.  AIrcraft is N462UP.
