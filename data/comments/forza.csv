forza,3e4155,BlunMeng,3,Tue Jul 21 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"Probably the most important thing to keep in mind is that it's not at all as ""arcady"" as many other racing games, which means that you will have to learn to actually break before corners or you simply won't be able to turn into them.  If it's not already on, go to settings and put on the braking line (braking only) - it will help you. Then there's also things like ABS which should also be ON, and things like TCS (traction control) and stability control. And you can also turn ""rewind"" on, so you can go back if you fail at a corner.  Have fun :>"

forza,3e4155,louievettel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:24:07 2015 UTC,"I'm always slamming into walls, crashing, and the steering feels a little stiff   What you might be referring to as ""stiff"" is the fact that 1.5 and 2-ton cars can't turn on a dime at 200 MPH, or at 150, or at 100.  If you watch real-world racing, you can watch NASCAR Cup cars turning at 200 MPH, but it's not a 90-degree turn through city streets but rather enormous, banked curves.  F1 cars, the most advanced and most agile cars on Earth, have to slow way down for sharp turns.  When you're traveling at a high rate of speed, you can steer left or right all you want but momentum insists on the car going straight.  When you steer, you're fighting the laws of physics which don't want you turning.  You can only do so much.  In other arcade racers cars have supernatural turning ability, but Forza isn't quite as unrealistic.  You can't make the cars do anything that defines the laws of physics.  Physics are God and is all-powerful."
forza,3e3t7i,ih8umum,3,Tue Jul 21 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"AWD only helps with launch, RWD makes up any difference in corners. Here are cars that are not DLC that you should have access too.    Lancia Delta S4 - AWD Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500 - RWD BMW 1M Coupe - RWD Ferrari F355 Challenge - RWD Honda S2000 - RWD VW Beetle - RWD (Insane launch and great in the corners)"
forza,3e3t7i,BlunMeng,3,Tue Jul 21 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions!  The way I set up my cars (or maybe the way I drive them) there's little to no difference in corner speed. During practice runs we did 2-second staging (I was in front in my R34) and vs. an RX-7 I kept the time very consistent between 1 1/2 and 2 seconds in front. What I'm looking for is the ability to continue holding the lead in the straightaway.  Again, thanks for the suggestions! I'll be sure to try them out."
forza,3e3t7i,BlunMeng,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:12 2015 UTC,For more straight line speed the RWD setup will help a lot since the performance index for AWD is always above RWD. I would also suggest doing a RWD conversion to a GTR R34 so you can squeeze more performance out of it.

The map is huge, you have rain, graphics, the bucket list and storm island.  But once you get to the Horizon 2 finale the game feels dead. In Horizon 1 you only get to the finals after you completed some 90% of the events, so you feel more dedicated to it. in H2 the finalle unlocked for me at 19%... lol"

I can't stand trying to make liveries in FH2 because of all of the glare and useless camera angles and bullshit.   Edit: Also, it'd be nice to have the option of having your decals cut off cleanly at body lines. Eyeballing it with hundreds of tiny squares and circles for the edges gets pretty damn old when it's obvious that the game is capable of doing this itself."

forza,3e15mg,K2TheM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:46:22 2015 UTC,"There already is a mirror function... but it's a process.  You can ""Copy all layers from opposite side"" to create a mirror from one side to the other. Now this only works for the side views, but you can use it to mirror vinyls for the hood/roof/etc. Process is as follows:   Work on one side at a time, say start with the right side.  Then do the right side of the top/front/back views.  Group all top layers into a single group, copy it and plaste it as is on the right side of the car. Repeat for Front/Back Select the Left side of the car and ""copy all from opposite side"". Cut and paste the mirrored groups from the Top/front/back to their respective views."
forza,3e15mg,VinnieAtlas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:41 2015 UTC,"I might not understand you.. but when I do this the layers get copied backwards.    For example: On the right side of the car I'll have a layer that reads ""Forza."" When I copy it to the left side it reads: ""azroF.""    are you saying that if I group the layers it will correct that issue? Sorry if I didn't completely understand what you're saying at the end there."
forza,3e15mg,K2TheM,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"Type... type is a different beast. Type has to be reset for the opposite side by hand. The easiest way to do this is to mirror the whole layer, then go back and copy the type you want, paste it on the opposite side and use the mirrored type as a guide for placement. Delete the mirrored letters when done.  The only ""groups"" with text that mirror properly are MFG logos."
forza,3e15mg,VinnieAtlas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:33 2015 UTC,seems like it's still a tedious task. I typically just copy it on to the other side and then mirror it while it's on the car still. I just make sure the measurements and sizes are the same.

forza,3dy1kd,RapidKiller1392,7,Mon Jul 20 23:36:40 2015 UTC,"Never take a picture with the default zoom setting of 1X. I always zoom in at least 3X to start with and adjust my spacing from the car after. When the entire car is in the frame I set my aperture somewhere between 20 and 40. It helps hide the, sometimes unattractive, backgrounds. (For this shot I zoomed in about 10X and maxed out the aperture at 100.)  This might sound strange but trust me: Set your color to 100 and then the sepia to 40. This is where it stops looking like a videogame and starts looking a lot more realistic.  Depending on the time of day you will need to change the exposure, contrast and brightness settings. I usually have them all over 60 and then fiddle with them to get the look I'm going for.

forza,3dys5h,iPhonebro,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:55:06 2015 UTC,"If we're going by what /u/Sub11610  said ""fastest naturally aspirated car"" then the LaFerrari is technically correct. The best kind of correct.   EDIT: But if we're being really technical then you could argue that the early 2000's Formula 1 cars are the most powerfully naturally aspirated cars.

forza,3dwll0,marker96,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:26:49 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly the same about the cross country races, especially compared to the street races. The AI seem to be expert rally drivers, so much that sometimes I've tried a cross country track with three different cars in a class and still not managed to get 1st place. When that happens, it's frustrating, but when I'm in a class/car that handles well enough on grass, they can be really fun races and the win actually feels like a challenge and accomplishment. IMHO the hardest cross country tracks are the one with the golf course from Saint-Martin (particularly the bumps on the driving range), and the one with a hill at the end (which is death to muscle cars) in the north east of the map (will update when I next play that route to remember)."

I drew the arrows in the trees, but I'm of course referring to the paved roads.   Start at the green X.  Downhill with some nice turns. Move through the hilly forest road (""Initial D Section"").  Feels like the famous show when it's nighttime. U-Turn at highway divider (yellow arrow), head back to start (purple arrows) Note the final stretch as you return to the starting point.  There's a section of roads only used on the return route.  (Marked ""JAPAN"" section on map)   HONORABLE MENTIONS  Inuyasha's routes:   Especially ""Tail of the Dragon"", Forza Horizon 2's most famous Battle Stage, located in the famous Castelleto touge, and variations (#2) on that #6 - Quick Downhill-Uphill loop #7 - 3 Hairpin switchback, short version   I now race these every day.  Also, running ""Citadel Circuit"" in Sisteron (aka THE THREE HAIRPINS; accessible in Rivals menu) is a superb outing and never gets old.

forza,3ddp46,IceMan_PJN,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:33:54 2015 UTC,The whole system was broken altogether.  I don't think I ever found a way to browse my liveries by car but rather had to scroll through a hundred liveries to find the one I want for my car.  It had duplicates and sometimes I'd download a new livery only for it not to show up.  That was in FM5.  I don't recall for sure if I had the same in FH2.
forza,3ddp46,CoconutDust,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:20:28 2015 UTC,"FH2 has the same problem.  They 100% carried over all of Forza 5's file system and menu system.  Takes 15 minutes to scroll down a list of 100 liveries.  When you get to the end of the list, you cannot skip to the start.  You cannot accelerate the scrolling.  LB/RB ""jumps"" you ahead but these are awkward buttons for menu navigation.  Especially frustrating considering that the system in Horizon 1 was better in every way."
forza,3ddp46,CoconutDust,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:33:31 2015 UTC,"There's about a million incredibly simple ways to improve on this area:   Higher limit for designs Let us group designs Give more distinct keyword labels (""Realistic"" versus ""RealWorld"" etc) or give a description for their use.  Currently it's a wild world and the labels are useless, nobody assigns them consistently, because they are not distinct enough or descriptive enough. Let us use acceleration while scrolling on the menu.  Tilt the analog stick a lot to scroll real fast.  Tilt it a little bit to scroll slow. Let us ""roll"" up or down while scrolling in the menu.  In these menus, many buttons including Up and Down are completely unutilized.  Use more dimensions.  We shouldn't have to navigate a single linear line of 150 items. When we reach the end of the menu, we should be able to skip to the beginning. ""Save to Current Car"" should actually do that.  In my experience, this seems to actually mean Save to Currently Loaded Design which is completely different.  I have ruined some previous hot-sellers on the marketplace by updating a tiny piece, even though I specifically saved it to the car, I did not overwrite the old file. Give an option to save to current car and save to catalog at the same time. Let us set ""Favorite"" colors.  So there's a new tab in addition to ""Previous Colors"" and ""Special Colors"":  * Favorite Colors.* Let us browse the color tiles when choosing a Special Texture like matte or two-tone.  Using a special texture currently forces you to choose color using the spectrum slider.  Unlike when you choose a ""Normal"" color, where you can skip around to browse the color tiles. Let us browse the marketplace for search hits for all cars.  Not just our current car (this makes no sense). Fix the ""still shot"" menu icons for liveries and cars.  The still shots look nothing like the actual 3D colors. Fix the ambient brightness in the paintshop garage.  Make it brighter and more consistent.  It's not bright enough to accurately gage your shadings.   I remember Horizon 1 being better and more professional in this regard.   The interface is really bad programming in basically every way."

forza,3d6rar,Sub116610,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"EA has had the Porsche license for sometime now. T10 got the Ferrari license after Microsoft wrote them a blank check. Sony has a couple of exclusive deals as well, the difference is that Turn 10 and Sony aren't assholes about it and will often let other groups use the license with a nominal fee or free. EA has notoriously been a dick when it comes to Porsche.   Supposedly EAs contract with Porsche will be ending soon, and I'm hopeful someone else will be able to step in and get Porsche to see the light, or at least force EA to stop charging absurd amounts to license the brand.   In answer to your question, I believe EA clamped on Porsche after Forza started to get real popular, while their Need For Speed franchise was going down the tubes. T10 doesn't really restrict the use of Ferraris in any game except the brand new ones that just come out."

forza,3d4bh0,RodRAEG,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:53:13 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it is mostly to do with committing time and resources to a car that is aesthetically and mechanically similar to a number of models already in game when they could be developing more varied assets instead.
forza,3d4bh0,AverageGuyGreg,-2,Mon Jul 13 16:52:02 2015 UTC,"I think its like the equivalent of Nintendo releasing a console-based Pokémon game.   Its the nuclear option for a time when the franchise is in steep decline. Save a handful of cars that are legendary as a sales boost when you need something new and sexy to attach to a DLC pack or a franchise release.  This car is a cover shot for Forza Horizon 3, or Forza 8, or at the very least an expansion."
forza,3d4bh0,dbcanuck,5,Mon Jul 13 13:40:44 2015 UTC,"Interesting point.  But they never put historically awesome cars on the cover.  The cover car is always a flaccid corporate cross-promotion deal with a manufacturer to parade out a brand new glamorous car.  Because brand new cars are on sale now in real life, which means somebody has something to gain by putting it on the cover.  (Nobody has anything to gain from putting a historically awesome car on there, except the connoisseur who appreciates a beautiful cover.)  I wish it was different though."
forza,3d4bh0,CoconutDust,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:28:17 2015 UTC,"I've always been happy with the cover cars, even if they are promotional. I favor the viper on the horizon cover though, is and always will be my favorite car"
forza,3d2hha,Bjudd,22,Mon Jul 13 00:14:25 2015 UTC,More body modification in general would be nice. Even if it's just different manufacturer options. There's too many cars in Forza that only have the Forza front bumper and wing. Forza is very limited in terms of customization. For most cars all you can do is rims and paint. The vinyl creator is the best in the business but apart from that the customization is very lackluster
forza,3d2hha,RapidKiller1392,5,Mon Jul 13 00:37:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, that's where the new NFS will probably excel. I'm assuming the next Forza Horizon game will have more aesthetical improvements but I doubt they will put much effort into the visual customizations in Forza 6; being it a track game. I could be wrong though, time will tell."
forza,3d2hha,RapidKiller1392,6,Mon Jul 13 00:45:49 2015 UTC,"I'm actually excited for the new NFS. It's seems like it'll have the deepest customization in recent years if not ever. Hopefully Forza will get with the program and offer us more in terms of customization, maybe a dyno where we could actually affect the power and torque curves, and all the features they keep taking out like custom searchable lobbies, a better way to search for and organize vinyls and liveries, and add more rims. I'd also like to see them make the wheel actually turn all the way. Pcars did something right with that part. If you use a controller then the wheel will turn like it does on Forza but if you use a wheel the in game wheel will actually follow your wheel all the way around."
forza,3d2hha,ben48,7,Mon Jul 13 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"Damn, that went into a lot of different topics"
forza,3d2hha,PussyMoneyWees,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:16:12 2015 UTC,This. I think Horizon is a series where Forza can focus on a more broader audience as well other niches in the racing genre - like Rally/Off-Road racing w/ Horizon 2 and hopefully more customization/drifting/street racing as well.
forza,3d2hha,willbsn13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:03:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly, hopefully they will make Horizon even more ""street"" versatile with customization. The actual Forza series is more about dominating the track with efficient performance building and tuning. Horizon 2 has really opened the doors for a somewhat realstic non-chalant car game.   It would be even more ridiculous if Microsoft decided to eventually incorporate motocross into the series to close the gap. Dirtbikes, street bikes, harleys, etc. It would really bring a crowd into the scene that would benefit the series hugely.   This is Microsofts combatant against Grand Turismo. Eventually they will need to really step out of their box of comfortability to further the Forza name."
forza,3d2hha,RapidKiller1392,2,Thu Jul 16 00:03:31 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely love more body modifications! Unfortunately it seems apparent that has never really been a massive focus for Forza - but I'm hoping we see more in a game like Horizon which makes more sense as its a game about car culture and customization is a big part of that. On the Motorsport side of things, I hope they look into bringing back Forza aero (and improve it) for the rear and side of cars which would be a lot of work considering they have 450 cars - but it would be cool to have something close to a works conversion from the NFS Shift games which was an underrated feature.  In terms of your point of about the customization being very lackluster apart from the vinyl creator - I would have to disagree slightly. Rims/Bodykits/Upgrades you are absolutely right - it is quite lackluster - but what other console racing game (please correct me if im wrong here) gives you option to RWD/AWD convert every car? Swap a new engine into practically every car? I know they've been in Forza for a while, but having that option is still awesome and goes under appreciated I think by a lot of Forza fans. Still your point still stands about lackluster visual customization and hopefully the team at T10 notices are market for improvement in this area in the Horizon games."
forza,3d2hha,willbsn13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:56:44 2015 UTC,The only part of performance modification that I feel they could do better is tuning like NFS UG2 had. Being able to put the car on a dyno and tune boost pressure at different rpms and tune the ECU to improve the power and torque curves. The tuning in Forza is good but it could be even better
forza,3d2hha,foxden_racing,2,Mon Jul 13 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would cool! There definitely a lot of ways Forza could improve in performance tuning and thats a great suggestion. I also think having branded parts would be awesome instead of just street/sport/race, but I know theres probably a licensing issue that comes with that.   Also, to be clear i wasn't saying that performance modification in the game was perfect by any means. I was just merely stating that it wasn't lackluster and the option to engine swap/drivetrain swap is under appreciated by many in the Forza community."
forza,3d2hha,RapidKiller1392,2,Mon Jul 13 02:14:51 2015 UTC,"Reading that makes me weep...the customization for 2 and 3 were incredible, and 4 had its moments."
forza,3d2hha,jamesmon,2,Mon Jul 13 03:56:53 2015 UTC,"It seems like it's par for the course these days. Better graphics, less features"
forza,3d2hha,RapidKiller1392,2,Mon Jul 13 04:20:11 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm missing something when people keep saying this. What options were available back then that we don't have now? It seems like the only difference was that some of the parts and rims were branded. Terms of actual customization different car colors etc. everything seems the same if not better. Especially with colors.
forza,3d2hha,foxden_racing,2,Mon Jul 13 12:05:46 2015 UTC,Color selection has gotten better yes but some cars lost custom parts. One example I can think of is the Nissan GTR. In Forza 4 it actually had different bumpers and wings available for it but after that they went away.
forza,3d2hha,NikiLouder,2,Mon Jul 13 14:37:10 2015 UTC,"They had a lot more alternate bumpers / skirts / rims / etc than the newer versions.  Especially true for the more mundane cars [civics, skylines, etc].  Hell, 2 had multiple choices of tire compound within a given grade...there wasn't just 'race' tires, there was 'Hankook race tires', 'Yokohama race tires', 'Michelin race tires', etc...each rated on 3 stats: grip, durability, and responsiveness."

forza,3d2hha,willbsn13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"NFS Shift 1 handled this really well, three body kits for every car except some super/hypers, and a 4th full widebody racing kit on some (Works convert). I'd really like to see something like that in Forza."
forza,3d2hha,FalkenMotorsport,3,Tue Jul 14 20:08:22 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Will we actually see something like this? Most likely not. There's too many cars for them in the game for T10 to add them in properly - in terms of giving widebody options too the majority of road cars.   It would take too many resources that could be used elsewhere - and I think a decision T10 would have certainly had ; ""Do we go into more detail with some of our existing models in the game so much as to add widebodies for some of them OR use those resources to build another track or refine another area of the game"". Ultimately they would have gone with the latter, which sucks, but is a design choice that T10 made and I respect - especially when we have 450 cars to choose from.  What I wish they would did do (and hopefully do) I take a small selection - maybe 10 or 15 cars and really flesh them out - customization wise - in terms of body kits, spoilers, widebodies etc - and perhaps charge that as a customization dlc for like $2.50-$4.00 to gauge market interest on customization in Forza, especially the Horizon series. Then they can see how many people are into deep visual customization in Forza and whether to focus more resources there."

The DoF focuses the attention on the main subject of the photo.  Example 2 is a perfect example of rule of thirds and a good use of negative space.  Example 3 has its abstract lines, it makes the viewer wonder what they are looking at it and really stare into the photo. Personally I wouldn't have gone so wide open but this may be a limitation in forza (small Fstop =  more detail?)  Example 4 is a great example of macro photography, depth of field cutting off the background, rule of thirds so its more pleasing to the eye, and perfect framing.  I'd wager that OP enjoys photography in real life too."

forza,3cwk5t,hermader,3,Sat Jul 11 11:34:32 2015 UTC,They added that feature back in 5. Now when you go to quick race you can rent any car unlike before where it was only the 20 or so you had to choose from.
forza,3cwk5t,ArcticFoxNews,2,Sat Jul 11 11:36:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't know haha. Sold 5 a while back but it would be good to see this feature in 6 from the start."

forza,3cwwl0,jimii,4,Sat Jul 11 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly none of them are similar in terms of car ownership and progression. If you're talking purely about simulator feel then I've heard people say that Assetto Corsa is the best, but bear in mind that pCARS runs better, looks better, has more cars, weather, day/night and more cars on track. Assetto has huge mod support and a better variety of cars, but I think pCARS is best overall content wise, especially in tracks.        In terms of the actual closest thing to Forza, the closest thing you could do is get a PS2 emulator and play Gran Turismo 4."
forza,3cwwl0,TheAdmiester,2,Sat Jul 11 14:27:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, although Assetto Corsa feels a bit weird with a controller, but you should be able to get used to it. As long as the PC and other games recognise it as a 360 controller it should work fine."
forza,3cwwl0,TheAdmiester,2,Sat Jul 11 16:20:21 2015 UTC,Yea pCars is probably the closest to Forza but the down side is there is no modding. Assetto Corsa has a TON of mods. So tracks and vehicles are everywhere and you can get almost everything you could think of. I have both and while pCARS is pretty the handling just isn't there for me. AC has laser scanned tracks and the physics is the best I've felt. I've only put about 29 hours into pcars and put almost 100 into AC.
forza,3cwwl0,BlazinLoudNLow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm thinking of going with AC.   Is there an option to zoom out FOV when in the cockpit?

forza,3cpg3a,CoconutDust,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:58:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately this is more basic functionality that has been stripped away.  As time marches on, as our technology becomes stronger, we are losing features for some reason.  (Note that you also cannot create a searchable custom public lobby, you can never choose what lobby you join, you can not re-race events that you like, you cannot to a ""Single Custom Race"", etc.)  The poor functionality of the market search is just another notch in the pattern.

forza,3cpg3a,CoconutDust,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:45:59 2015 UTC,"SOLUTIONS:   Let us create our own ""groups"" or favorites.  This would be in keeping with 21st century computer software. Add a ""compare"" button so you can compare two cars and narrow your focus.  I hate having to flip left and right between two cars that are 10 slots apart while the timer ticks down.  NOTE: this wouldn't be an issue if we could choose what lobby we join, it's an issue because we can only play random unknown races and game types Add acceleration to the analog stick for navigating the car selection menu.  Tilt the stick far to scroll real fast.  Tilt it a little bit to go slow. Utilize the up/down buttons.  Left and right scroll left and right.  Up and down should let us ""roll"" or ""flip"" between different rows or categories or brands of cars.  (Preferably customizable categories.) When you scroll to the end of the menu, you should be able to skip back to the start.  This is programming 101 and has been in place as far back as Nintendo games in like 1985.  Come on. Stop using LB/RB for menu navigation.  These buttons are awkward for repeated presses.  Again this is Design 101.   And Rapidkiller1392, how about when the timer ticks down, and it assigns you a random rental car?  Which is not even tuned up for the current class?  How hard is to at least stick us with a car we actually own.  Makes no sense.  Also: car selection during multiplayer should show you all cars for which you have a tune for the current class.  in other words, you don't just choose a car, you choose a tune.  So that we don't have to buy duplicates of a $5,000,000 car just to use it online.  These very small simple fixes would make this game less painful."
forza,3cpg3a,CoconutDust,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:02:11 2015 UTC,"I really cannot stand it anymore. Literally all the suggested tunes are either a Falken drift car replica or 50 different kinds of Ken Block liveries. It's mildly infuriating because I know from previous games that there are some amazing artists out there that I would absolutely love downloading their tunes. There was variety as well which I loved, sometimes I don't know what I want in terms of designs or vinyl groups and this just makes things shitty because there is almost zero variety."

My feelings with many of the models used by Turn 10 is that they would look even more realistic if the edge fillet/chamfers on some objects were greater. There is a consistent trend where they jusy seem too small too minor and it makes edges look sharper than they maybe should. The chrome and brightwork is beautifully done in the series, so much so that it shows off these modelling flaws.  Than again, does it really matter? There are actual concerns worth worrying about,  such as the headlight shape and general murky grey lifeless appearance on some cars i.e 22b S2000 and R32 Skyline.   At least on those which feature polycarbonate headlamps they could throw a little yellow into the opacity mix and theyd just look aged."

There won't be a physical copy of the Ultimate Edition because it's simply the standard game plus the DLC bundled for a small discount.

forza,3ci452,skylin4,2,Wed Jul 8 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"Something a bit different for our league back in Forza 4 (hard to do on 5 without many ovals) was to run a race we liked to call the Particle Accelerator, pick any cars to run on Twin Ring or Sunset Peninsula, set a time limit, turn damage off. The front half would run normal, the back half would turn around and try to stop the front half as much as they could. Their ""team"" would then run forwards in the next race to try and beat the distance.  A and S class cars seemed to be the better vehicles, too fast and it was hard to hit anyone unless they drove straight into you.  Was good fun when we wanted to get crash and smash racing out of our system after some good battles in proper races.  Here's hoping for more ovals in Forza 6 so we can bring this back to full glory."

A four player one we had was clunker pushing, cat and mouse with two teams, one really slow car (like the VW Fox) and something like a B class car, set the mouse (slow car) to have power and grip reduction (so it's even slower) while the cat is normal, the cat then needs to push their mouse around Fujimi Kaido or the Nurburgring.

It should be its own separate mode and/or a multiplayer thing.  I passionately hate drifting, it does absolutely nothing for me, and if it was ever featured in career mode it would turn me off to Forza a bit, much like how forcing Gymkhana into the career mode in DiRT 3 detracted from DiRT 3.  Not everyone gives two shits about drifting.  Fans of drifting seem to view it as this hugely popular thing but it's nowhere remotely as popular as actual racing, at least not in real-world motorsport.  NASCAR races see several million viewers per race and F1 races see quite a bit more, while the figures I've found for Formula Drift viewership is is the range of 150,000 to 230,000 unique viewers for a weekend.  Forza Motorsport is a racing game."

forza,3cdzzp,baolin21,9,Tue Jul 7 07:51:38 2015 UTC,"Except for Storm Island, I can't really recall the last time FH2 tried to ""push DLC"" on me.   It's very much about racing. Turn off all the assists except for braking line, enable manual transmission with a clutch, and use only the cockpit view, and watch yourself eat those words. I'd argue that in some cases, Horizon is more difficult than Forza.   The difference is unlike regular Forza, it's not all about tarmac racing, and you have to consider all the many different road types (including offroad) and that makes for a greater challenge. When a race takes you through a field of corn and has you plowing through fences and catching air, it becomes suddenly much clearer to you that all the expertise you've built up on the tarmac in Forza won't help you and this is something completely new.    I am excited for Forza 6, but Forza Horizon 2 will always have a very specific and different purpose than Forza. Just because it doesn't work for you doesn't make it a ""kiddy video game"" and ""not about racing"". I have yet to buy a single DLC pack for any of the Forza games (since Forza 3), because there are way, way too many cars as it is for you to feel so devoid of content that you feel the need to buy more. If DLC is really your biggest issue about the game, I strongly suggest you do what the rest of us are capable of doing; ignore it.

The more barn finds the better."

Another thing I'd love for FH3, is something that I miss a little from TDU2, the ability to buy apartments/houses. Driving up to a real-estate company and buying a house after saving up for it, and then parking your car(s) in it's garage, it felt awesome in TDU2. The whole atmosphere about owning cars and houses in TDU2 made it feel realistic.   Imagine starting up the game, it's morning in-game, sun is rising over the mountains and Japanese landscape as you head to the garage, start up your favourite car and is ready to take on Japan. (Or anywhere really)   Aw yis."

There are also some really amazing racetracks that could be involved in this like Tsukuba or Motegi.   They won't do that for the same reason FH1 and FH2 didn't have closed purpos-built circuits - there's already a game for that and Horizon was meant to be something different.  Also, Europe has tracks that could've just the same been added to FH2 but they weren't added."

I'm surprised they don't have it like how they had it in the first Horizon and F&F:Horizon where all of the events were open all of the time once they were unlocked.  I guess they really just wanted the road trips to be the point of everything.  I'm sure all of this will be changed in Horizon 3 though. I hope they go back to lobbies personally. Playing Infection whenever you wanted or endless racing when you wanted without a road trip interruption will be fun again. Maybe they can even keep the road trip too for more options."
forza,3c4zxv,Fn_Strobe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry, friend.  There is no ""Custom Race"" mode or ""Single Race"" mode.  This is a feature that has been a basic part of every racing game for the past 20 years.  You are absolutely right that it's a super basic concept. Personally I find this outrageous and I consider it a betrayal of the players.  You can never race any event unless you re-do the ""Road Trip"".  And of course, each road trip only includes a small set of races.  To make things even worse, there's no public custom lobbies.  When you go into online multiplayer, what you play is completely random, so you never get to choose what type of game of you want to play.  The content is there, the racing itself is great, but you are literally not allowed to ever choose what you want to do, neither in single-player or multiplayer.  Personally I like street racing with C-B-A class cars during the night-time, but I am never allowed to do this except for a few minutes during each day/night cycle.  It is unacceptable.  The driving in the game is great, the game is otherwise excellent, but these major missing features make it an extremely frustrating experience."

forza,3bx45v,fleaver12,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:52:16 2015 UTC,content being the game itself? aren't there free cars that you can get without having to purchase DLC?
forza,3bx45v,nickbfromct,2,Fri Jul 3 01:22:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, here is the big, broad answer:  Your Xbox One is tied to a single Xbox Live Account (probably yours). Any content you purchase with this account is available for every other account on that Xbox. For example, if you have a digital copy of FM5 on your Xbox, that was purchased with your gamertag, anyone on that Xbox has access to FM5. This is also true for DLC.  Now, when you download DLC for Forza, it lets the account that payed for it, get all the cars free in-game, without spending credits. Any other gamertags will have access to the DLC, but they will need to use in-game credits to purchase the cars, just like any other cars in the base game.  Edit: There are free cars you can get without purchasing DLC. These fall into two categories. There are some cars just gifted out for fun, or because you did something (like Forza Rewards). These only apply to you. The second category are the free monthly cars. Every account will have access to these, but only your account will be able to get them in-game without spending credits."

I drive only in cockpit view.  A couple things:   You can get a small amount of immersion by first pressing up on analog stick, then tilting to the right of left.  Lets you look around cockpit, in a limited way.  Kind of fun. Rendering the sides or rear of cockpit from first person would use up too much computing resources, for an unimportant purpose.  The game renders your own car interiord with more polygons than other players cars.  And the polygon ""budget"" is limited.  So it would only be possible to see your rear window or backseat in low resolution.  And that would be a ""party foul"" to our graphics-obsessed and ignorant world of vocal players and journalists-who-don't-play-racing-games-anyway.  (Basically,  the developers would do what you want, render the rear and sides of the car, but the polygon quality would be like looking at another player's car interior, zoomed in.)   I'm fine with this!  Doesn't seem worth it to render the back in 3D."

It looked and drove great, and the open wheel cars (especially the 1976 F1 cars) were a treat but I had hoped for more. Plus the career kinda bored me with the standard racing sim selection. It didn't really feel like progress, just checking a box off the list. Most of the achievements felt that way too and it gave the game a very grindy feel. I enjoyed it for the racing and the cars but the structure and objectives just weren't enough to keep it interesting."
forza,3bsjjo,moparr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:21:52 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed rivals and the laser scanned tracks. I raced a 24h of LeMons event on RA a few months before the track was released for FM5. Going from the FM4 version to the real version was a huge difference, the FM5 version with the bend on turn 11 instead of the kink was almost dead on to the real track.  So while it might had been a holdover, I'm glad it was there and feel I've got my money's worth out of it."
forza,3bsjjo,CiDhed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:22:41 2015 UTC,I agree. The tracks and raving were excellent. I haven't raced on the track but I've been to the Sebring 12 hour a few times and it's damn accurate as far as I can tell.
forza,3bsjjo,moparr,2,Thu Jul 2 15:48:55 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with 5 is the drivatars. I liked them at first but no matter what difficulty setting I have them on they are either unpredictable with one really fast one or all really fast and still just as unpredictable. They don't act like someone who cares about winning at all. I wish they would a) actually take damage and b) want to finish the race without trading paint. Luckily FM6 looks to have an option to remove the dickhead feature of them.  Also, qualifying, starting at the back of the pack every race screws you if you are on a tight track with AI difficulty turned up, the race isn't long enough to safely get around the bad AI and beat the leader that didn't have to contend with the rest of the pack.  Regarding the laser scanned tracks, the biggest thing I noticed between the two were the bumps in the road from heavy braking. I hear people complain about maple valley but unless they could make the fictitious track have accurate surface roughness, I don't want them. There are plenty of real tracks that could go in the game, Barber, Autobahn Country Club and Gingerman to name a few from my area."

forza,3buoz4,Clutch41007,5,Thu Jul 2 08:24:37 2015 UTC,The Viper is not Dodge anymore. Neither is the Ram. They had some brand reconstruction a few years back. Ram is it's own brand now and SRT is it's own brand. So instead of it being a Dodge Viper SRT it's just an SRT Viper now and instead of being a Dodge Ram 1500 it's just a Ram 1500 now.  EDIT: So I just looked it up and apparently SRT is being consolidated back into Dodge now but that still doesn't change the classification of the SRT Viper since the 2013 SRT Viper GTS was manufactured under the brand of SRT. If the new Viper is put into Fm6 then it will be put into Dodge but not the SRT Viper
forza,3buoz4,RapidKiller1392,0,Thu Jul 2 09:43:40 2015 UTC,"Well, according to the current official car list, the Gen V Viper is in, but as the 2013 model, when it was under the SRT moniker.  I suppose my thinking is, wouldn't it be better to simply stealth-update the lineup and make it a Dodge to keep with current events, so to speak?  The GTS is still an available trim model, so the only thing that would have to be done is minor coding issues; add 5 hp (as the current Viper is now rated for 645 hp), put in any new color options, and call it a Dodge.  If you don't want to deal with any badging issues, make it a 2014 and not a 2015 (as this year's model changed that around slightly).  If nothing else, it would make things more manageable when they inevitably add the 2016 ACR.  That said, I wonder if there's more to it than I'm seeing, like licensing issues or if the programming would throw things off more than I'm aware of."
forza,3buoz4,RapidKiller1392,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:01:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly the way I see it going is they're just gonna transfer over the 2013 Viper into the game as they've done with other cars. When they added that Viper in Forza Horizon 1 they had it under SRT while the other Dodge Vipers were under Dodge. I see where you're going with it, having all the Vipers consolidated into Dodge but i doubt they're gonna do that. Having that Viper under SRT adds another brand to ""boost"" their brand numbers and when they add the 2016 ACR they'll just put it under Dodge"
forza,3buoz4,HokieSpeed,2,Thu Jul 2 17:16:40 2015 UTC,"I think even though SRT is a Dodge product, it kind of stands on its own, whereas ACR is a non manufacturer like RUF would be.  It may also be a cheap way to add in another manufacturer, boosting that number as well."

forza,3bqwjl,CarbonCamaroZL1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:38:38 2015 UTC,I wonder if they changed that (since it used to tell you exactly which motor in Forza 4) to save on licensing costs or something.
forza,3bqwjl,yourstraitfriend,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:28:20 2015 UTC,Forza4 didn't let you swap between manufacturers. You could put a GTR engine in a Datsun but not an LS into an RX7.
forza,3bqwjl,nickodator,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:17:35 2015 UTC,"Well, what I meant was engines had names to them. If you were throwing a ZR1 engine into a C5 Z06, it was called ZR1 6.2L Supercharged V8 or something like that.  But yeah, I think they probably removed them official names and now just call them 6.2L V8 instead so that licensing doesn't get in the way of putting engines in other makes, plus the cost is probably cheaper."

I was looking very much forward to the new NFS (with worries though) because it has so much potential, but myself and I came to the conclusion that I couldn't wait 4-5 months for it's release without playing an open world game with customization etc. so I took a gamble and bought an xbox one just for Horizon 2.  Best gamble ever. This game is what I hope the new NFS will be. It's probably better in terms of realism than NFS will ever be. And the car-sounds in this game. The 240sx in the picture sounds amazing when upgraded a bit. Same for the other cars I've tried so far. AND THERE ARE SO MANY TO TRY D:  Also noticed some details such as the way tires sound when doing ""burnouts"" and drifting, sounds much more real to me than any game I've tried before.  It brings back memories to TDU2 which was awesome. (Horizon 2 could learn from TDU2 and implement the ability to buy houses, would be very welcomed.)  But all in all it's probably the best and most enjoyable driving/car-game I've ever tried.  That is all.  Edit: Oops, didn't know the POTW was for SUVs.. until now."

forza,3bo8qz,kdryan,43,Tue Jun 30 20:21:39 2015 UTC,"Yes.*  * Forza 5 is not a game T10 wanted to make, I'm thoroughly convinced of that...and also was their sounding board for frustrations at the people who made sure we can't have nice things.  Coming off 3 and 4, T10 was tired of being the bad guy.  They've wanted since day 1 for the game to be perfectly enjoyable for someone who isn't a racer...a place that celebrated car culture, not just cars.  If you wanted to build custom cars and sell 'em, you could.  If you wanted to paint designs to sell, you could.  If you wanted to hunt for the rarest of the rare, you could.  You didn't have to race, which sounds a bit odd in a racing game, but for FM2 and FM4, they managed to pull it off.  The economy that allowed all that to happen was sacred to them.  They were also very, very, very passionate about making sure that E rating stuck...that just because online was involved, didn't mean that it was no longer something everyone of any age could enjoy.  Problem is, in 3 and especially 4, shitheads gonna shit and the rest of us couldn't have nice things as a result.  Modded-in credits flooded the system, completely throwing the economy out of whack...to the point where the 'unicorns up for auction' became a honeypot for cheaters, not an actual auction.  Design unlocking was rampant, and possession was 10/10ths of the law.  You could collaborate with a friend on something, they could slip in a stolen design, and if you sold it, you were the one getting banned.  Late in the game's cycle, someone figured out how to screw with the car database itself...leading to everything from 2500hp civics to cars with parts of their meshes deleted or swapped out for another car's [no bumper was pretty popular, as was manufacturer-only rims].  And again, possession was 10/10ths of the law; race one, or sell one, and your ass was grass.  The AH was also useful for distributing prize money for leagues and things, which they turned a blind eye to as long as the cash was legitimately acquired...but they were always on the lookout for credit laundering.  So come 5, T10 decided to take their ball and go home.  Instead of a design storefront, we got that awful 'pay per use' thing.  The auction house went away entirely.  Everything they worked so hard for got thrown out, all because shitheads did what shitheads do best.  Meanwhile, the vocal fanboys were the ones who wanted to be 'special' based on the things they owned in-game, which [when paired with corporate's push for tokens] led to the awful launch-day pay ratios.  I was just plain sick of hearing 'BAWWW, too many people have the 330P/Daytona/250GTO, how am I supposed to be special now?' over and over again, and I can only imagine how much it must've gotten on T10's collective nerves.  They also lobbied for the current engine swap setup...famous engines, instead of a selection from that same manufacturer, when really there's no reason we couldn't have gotten both.  I imagine the 'mass appeal' push was equal parts frustrated customers wanting to come over from Horizon and corporate.  On top of that, corporate [read: MS] was hellbent on a couple things.  One was that XBO would 'bring the mobile economy to the living room'.  Every single launch game had to have some sort of microtrans in it, and overtly so...hence why it went from 'Just in case you're impatient' to 'Which do you want to use' to 'Wouldn't you rather use tokens?  Don't forget tokens!  $999.99 best deal!'.  Another was that every launch game had to push Azure [their cloud computing platform] in some way or another.  In FM5's case, it powered the 'training' aspect of the neural nets that power the AIs, crunching the data so you didn't have to play a separate game mode ala FM1 to teach it [which is a shame, that mode was a ton of fun].  Thirdly was the push to use the Metro UI...live tiles, ugly boxes, that sort of thing, not unlike the XBO interface itself.  Lastly, corporate was hellbent on having the game for launch, whether it was ready or not...and it most certainly wasn't ready.  It was rushed out the door to meet an arbitrary date, and suffered for it big time.  On top of it all, they saw how the GT series gets shit for choosing ""This car doesn't look so great"" over ""Where is [insert car here]!"", so went the other route, and didn't get any less of a savaging for it.  I've had the pleasure of talking to Dan during the Game with Devs nights; the Dan Greenawalt that was giving interviews defending FM5 was not the Dan I had talked to.  The Dan I talked to was more like the one who's giving interviews about 6.  He's still toeing a company line, dancing around certain subjects...but you can tell just from comparing them that his heart's in this one.  May 6 be a worthy successor to 4. :)"
forza,3bo8qz,foxden_racing,5,Tue Jun 30 21:09:25 2015 UTC,"Well put.  It does seem clear that rampant micro transaction madness, and other things, was pushed by Microsoft for Forza 5, not so much Turn 10.  But, in my opinion, if you look carefully at what cars they made DLC and what cars they didn't make DLC, it really shows bad faith and hostility toward hardcore players and car enthusiasts.  Just compare the built-in car list of Horizon 1 or 2 to Forza 5.  All the cult classics and interesting cars are DLC.  And all the modern cars that function as product placement for the their respective corporations are free.  Likewise, the push for Metro tiles (I couldn't agree more that this was forced and is just bad design).  Yes, that was of course a bad road to go down for interface design, but if you look carefully at the interface more broadly, you see that there were about a thousand bad decisions about the interface that presumably came internally, not from Microsoft.  Scrolling down a list of paint jobs or cars for 5 minutes?  And many more examples that are painful to deal with when I just want to race (or do paintjobs).  My point is just that Microsoft's influence can only be blamed up to a point.  And I don't say this to argue with you, but to expand on your discussion and talk about the other factors that appear to be at play.  There is a much larger problem of focussing on fetish-perfect rendering of hood ornaments to the detriment of everything else in the game.  If they re-aligned their priorities we could be in racing nirvana right now.  Steve Jobs, the old leader of Apple, once said something like ""Your business goes into a slow death spiral when you find your initial success and then your marketing people gain more and more power relative to the creative people.""  I have never seen a more sad and obvious and nauseating embodiment of this principle than in the Forza interviews over the past few years.  Also, if you look at all the regressions that happened in Horizon 2 compared to 1 (not including the OUTSTANDING driving feel and the scenery), it points to a wider phenomenon beyond Playground Games, at Turn 10 or Microsoft or both."

forza,3bo8qz,foxden_racing,4,Wed Jul 1 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"Every single launch game had to have some sort of microtrans in it, and overtly so...hence why it went from 'Just in case you're impatient' to 'Which do you want to use' to 'Wouldn't you rather use tokens? Don't forget tokens! $999.99 best deal...   Did no one else remember car tokens from Forza 4? It was literally the same level of ""Micro Trans Oppression"" as what's in FM5. As in it shows up once to let you know it's there, and then not there again till you run out of money.  On the subject of the money. The payouts weren't as bad as all the complainers make it out to be, they just got high off the cars Forza 4 gave out like candy at a parade.   The new engine swap method is fine, but is missing some normal info, as in what V8 hemi is this. The fan theory for this is T10 was able to do these crazy swaps only if they didn't explicitly state what the engine is and who makes it. Reason being that MFG's didn't want it to be shown that you could put an engine in their car from another MFG and make it faster... or so the theory goes. I don't really care that much because it means I can have my VTEC Mini and V8 Miata.  I truly wanted the new storefront to work, as it should be better for everyone; but a high use requirement for payouts and a clumsy way to view/ search for designs meant that if didn't make a quick or popular design on day one you were SOL making credits off your designs.  Of all the things Forza 5 failed at, it's the menu UI that's the worst for me. Metro can work with a controller, but you have to have your inputs be consistent (see XBO UI). FM5 feels like a different designer worked on each different page and never looked at what any other designer was using. Some of the menus are nice and functional, but they are the rarity (Career main menu and the multiplayer/Rivals menus are the stars IMO)."
forza,3bo8qz,K2TheM,3,Tue Jun 30 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"4's tokens were unobtrusive; 5 at launch was more obnoxious than even the worst fly-by-night app store cash grabs, shoving them in your face at every opportunity.  The payouts were stingy even compared to the tightwad that was FM2.  The patch helped, the patch helped tremendously, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was originally done the way it was to ""encourage"" token sales.  Pitting one's wallet against their patience is a common F2P tactic, after all.  Engine swaps I'm not angry about, more disappointed.  I miss being able to throw weird stuff into my cars, not just  'LS[X] in a [Y]'.  But, it was one of the massive changes for FM5, so it was worth a mention.  Personally, I would've loved for them to keep the manufacturer options and add the new stuff.  The new storefront has its benefits, namely in ease of finding things and encouragement to do the same...but as you said, the economy involved was even worse than what 3/4 had.  I've been stumping for a return to the 'unlocked' option from 2 for a while now, but admittedly that's selfish.  I'm great at making things into more than the sum of their parts, and horrible at making things from scratch, so would love a 'may resell' flag on bought vinyls.  Agreed on metro.  Personally I think it's a huge step back [as rich, deep graphics get replaced by monochrome] and only exists because MS desperately wants people to like Win8, but irrespective of opinion the easiest way to make a good UI bad and a bad UI worse is to be inconsistent."
forza,3bo8qz,foxden_racing,3,Wed Jul 1 00:53:44 2015 UTC,"I was hoping the new storefront would be smart about the vinyl groups. Meaning you could use whatever you wanted and put it up on the store front (the whole car, not an adapted grouping) and it would give the creator of the group some credits for its use... But alas that was not so."
forza,3bo8qz,K2TheM,2,Wed Jul 1 02:39:02 2015 UTC,That would've been a very nice way to automate it.  Maybe for 6!
forza,3bo8qz,foxden_racing,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:37:02 2015 UTC,"Great analysis. The only other thing I can think of (that a lot of people have forgotten) is the post-E3 ""always connected"" about-face that MS pulled. No doubt time that had been targeted for polish and testing had to be re-scoped for the disentanglement of being always connected. And I'm guessing that's not minor - an assumed core component (Live/Azure) was suddenly removed from the picture, and T10 had to scramble to still make launch.  Thankfully the Mattrick days are over."
forza,3bo8qz,Sparkstalker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"While I agree with most of these points, as a time-strapped gamer, I really enjoyed the VIP pack payout system of Forza 5.   I've played Forza 1-5 and I have to say I had more enjoyment out of 5 than any of the other games because there was effectively no grind.   With F4, unless I wanted to give up every other from of entrainment and and devote my life to F4 I was never going to get even a ferrari, let alone a prototype racer...    I showed up to the game about 8 months post-launch so I guess I missed the inital bruh-ha about credit payouts.  It was incredible to actually be able to get cool cars and upgrade them freely without needing 300 hours of racing C and B classes, or other obscure cars.  Or worse yet grinding out the same series over and over because it has the highest payout.   The car-handout system of the previous games was shit IMO.  Oh hey look, 5 cars to pick from, and none of them I fucking want!   I don't like money vs. time.  but with 60 hours a week of work what is a racer to do?   It sucked to drop $30 on the VIP pass but I make that in far less than 1 day of work and it let me ""get to the fun"" a hundred hours ahead of 4.  If I have to have to play to avoid grinding, I personally hope they keep the VIP option rather than some absurd token system.      Though, hated the UI, trying to browse setups or designs was a joke.  I was rage-face that the option of people giving away free, unlocked tunes is still gone (its was a fantastic way to learn tunes from earlier games).  It was also very sad to see the auction house die too.  Rather than fix it, baby with the bathwater instead.    I didn't like their new tire model.  It did go a long way to stop the game from feeling like every car was just a sled with a ""skin"" but IMO the grip levels were far too low in comparison with actual cars.  Doubly so for RWD drive cars.   Sets up often required insanity like running fully open rear ends just so you wouldn't get power-on oversteer like a motherfucker...   It felt like I was driving on ice far more than it should have.   I've since tried out Assetto Corsa and Project Cars and I have to say its nearly impossible to go back to Forza 5 now.   But fuck all I really miss big car lists and building tuners.  No-modification racing sims really leave me wanting for shit like racing a tweaked out miata against ferarri's and winning...     The car list was horrid.  DLC helped some...but meh.  The whole affair was needlessly expensive. And I want to find the fucking artist that put a 30% tint on all the windshields for my favorite cars.   Corvette C7 and Shelby Cobra come to mind...  Between the tint and the constant OMFG LENZ FLARE! I couldn't see fucking shit to race.   Fuck me for wanting immersive cockpit view right?    As it stands now I really hope to hear F6 is coming to Windows 10 as I invested in a g27 wheel.   Though that remains a huge fucking IF...that most likely ins't coming true.    But pretty much everything becomes a moot point because if F6 doesn't come out on Windows 10, I likely will not be playing it.  I might have to settle for iracing though I am really not an online type.    Once you go 1440p at 60hz its hard to go back to xbox."
forza,3bo8qz,nordoceltic,8,Wed Jul 1 19:43:24 2015 UTC,I think Forza 5 may have more so been the groundwork for Forza 6. The game was clearly rushed but the fact that they could get it out on the xbone with an all new physics engine (with 60fps and 1080p) makes it worth it. I'm extremely excited to see how they can improve the engine and overall gameplay in Forza 6 since they have had time to work with the next gen console more. Overall I still played the crap out of FM5 no matter what it lacked.
forza,3bo8qz,CRob2100,7,Tue Jun 30 20:30:33 2015 UTC,After 1500  hours in forza 4 and only 300 in 5 i have to agree
forza,3bo8qz,psilocybe_XL,5,Tue Jun 30 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"Anyone who says that Forza 5 wasn't a letdown obviously isn't much of a Forza player may not have spent enough time with the other games to see exactly what features Forza 5 deleted.   Anyway, I think that a ""letdown"" can still be good, great, and playable, etc.  The fact is:   The Forza 5 framerate and the graphics are nice (except for the horrible lighting engine). The Forza 5 cars have lots of polygons.   OK, great.  But these were the only primary focus of improvements over previous Forza games.  Everything else in the game is a step back.  It really seemed to be a big struggle with the new hardware and meeting the launch date, but there is more evidence that the developers just don't care about things that the most committed Forza players care about.  Starting with the important points you mentioned (tracks, the economy), but it goes beyond that and expands into every aspect of the game.  Custom searchable public lobbies have been deleted (also deleted in the transition from Horizon 1 to Horizon 2).  The degradations even include the visual design of the HUD.  The fonts for rank/laps, and even the tachometer have less thought and effort put into them in Forza 5 compared to 4.  Thin fonts, letters equal size for no contrast, and letters are warped (apparently to simulate reading the inside of your visor?)  Bolder font, larger letters for readability and emphasis  That's a minor point, I know it seems tiny on the surface, but it's illustrative.  Over the course of many years of progression in a series, polish is supposed to increase, not decrease.  Another example:  look at the menus, where it takes five minutes to scroll to the end of your list of paintjobs or cars.    The driving in Forza 5 feels great, but it's frustrating to put up with the sloppy design everywhere else, like the never-ending pay-out screens when I just want to get back to racing.  And what they have revealed so far about Forza 6 shows the same priority:  Car polygons.  And that's it At this point, the developers don't seem keen on developing and designing a ""game"" or experience, but more of a car showroom.  Which hurts the number of tracks, and so forth.  Sadly, car polygons is the only way to rope in journalists and fair-weather fans who really have no interest in the game or racing games in general."
forza,3bo8qz,CoconutDust,3,Tue Jun 30 22:05:19 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a let down because I only bought it for 20 bucks, and last checked I spent about 5 days worth of time racing in the few months i had the game."

Even so, I think your human spirit yearns for something more.  Or at least, I think most people who put time into Forzas (plural) hoped for something more that Forza 5 was not able to deliver.  A standard was already set by Forza 4, and the newest ""next gen"" did not live up to its own predecessor.   That's more what I was talking about.  But you make a good point:  for an individual, a low price can make it difficult to criticize the game in terms of cost or ""playtime value""."

Nice No True Scotsman fallacy you got there.   Everything else in the game is a step back.   Physics are improved for one thing. The audio quality is also greatly improved as to what you can hear on the car, even to the point that a fully weight reduced car will sound rattly as one would in real life.   Then for every bad drivatar you come across you have ten good ones that make the racing seem that much better than the ""off the racing line is hot lava"" drivers you had in the other series. I actually have fun in single player in 5. I gave up in singleplayer in all the previous ones after a short while because of that.  I've been playing Forza since Forza 2 and the Forza series is theonly reason I have a 360 or an XBOne. Forza 5 is my favourite so far regardless.  Just because I like a different iteration of the series than you doesn't somehow instantly make me less of a fan."
forza,3bo8qz,Kezika,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:56:11 2015 UTC,"Great physics, it's true.  Yet the damage modeling, and the impact/crash physics don't seem to lag significantly behind those advances.  And the audio is crisp, but the engines don't sound like an engine sounds like when I'm behind the wheel of a car in real life (this became all the more clear to me when I played Project Cars, a severely flawed game that did a fresh take on some aspects, like sound).  I started adding more bullet points to the list above when I made my post, but I didn't want to get bogged down with what are basically incremental upgrades for a new generation of a franchise, which seems like a low standard.  Furthermore, the drivatars etc, although I like them too, do not outweigh larger issues like the track selection or custom public lobbies.  By ""much of a Forza player"" I meant ""someone who spends a lot of time with these games"", and I do presume that most such people will be aware of the flaws as well as the good points, and will have a clear notion of exactly where Forza took a step back or didn't live up to expectations [which is partly understandable, due to launch title timelines].  I'm aware of the NTS fallacy.  Anyway, I do realize I'm speaking to a mythical abstract ""Forza Player"", but I believe the consensus is that Forza 5 did not live up, and I also believe that the people most disappointed with Forza 5 will be the ones who have spent the most time with other Forza games.  I wouldn't claim you are less of a fan for whatever reason.  But I do think if you think carefully about what you liked about previous games, like Forza 4 or even Horizon 1, you'll note that Forza 5 is disturbingly lacking in some areas, even if you find it perfectly playable and it's your favorite one.  Anyway, there are other factors that kind of make Forza 5 the best for me (not counting Horizon).  This would be the Xbox One triggers, which are superb, plus they have built-in rumble, and the analog sticks are superb too.   This helps make the driving into a great experience, but there are so many other things that are just frustrating and bring the game down."

Yeah I can definitely get that for the people that used those features a lot, I just never really was a big person on the marketplace or customer public lobbies. If I was then yeah I'd side more towards Forza 4.  I also don't like the lower car selection all too much, but I let it slidee as it is understandable given the time crunch Microsoft put them in by making them a launch title, which they originally weren't going to be."

forza,3bo8qz,aurorafluxic,2,Tue Jun 30 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"I can't examine the true motives or possible biases here.  But finding charm and sophistication in one actor's performance, and not in another, seems to be a perfectly legitimate evaluation.  Not inherently sexist.  I think I had a similar experience in Horizon 2 compared to Horizon 1.  The Horizon 1 mechanic character (""Gus"" or something) sounded genuine, he seemed to know about cars and he sounded natural.  The Horizon 2 mechanic character who talks to you about barn-finds etc sounds forced and fake, the lines are poorly written, and the performance is bad, and you can tell from the line-readings that she knows nothing about cars.  I fully support and embrace that they chose a female for the role.  But the script was bad (""HEY MAN! WHERE YOU BEEN KEEPIN YOURSELF?""), and this particular actor's performance was bad.  I know for a fact that there are females who know A LOT about cars and are passionate about them and could have given a good performance.  But, the developers and the voicing director dropped the ball here."
forza,3bo8qz,CoconutDust,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:30:27 2015 UTC,"First, I think it's a great thing and important that you took a new perspective on what you said.  But anyway, the real problem here is:  it's not the actor's fault, it's the creator's fault.  Remember that what you perceived as a girl trying to be cool, was (and THIS IS WEIRD!) an actress who the director forced and/or allowed to sound fake.  The directors did the casting call, the directors approved her lines in the script, the director supervised the voice recording in the sound booth.  She had no choice but to sound awkward or turn down a paid job.   Evidently, nobody said ""this isn't working"" and nobody coached the line-readings.  Instead they all apparently said: ""This is good enough.""  I think that's where the problem is, and that's where the blame lies.  Unfortunately, it's often the case in game development that the people on staff know nothing about cinema or acting or script-writing, hence why the cut scenes and acting and dialog in most videogames is on the same level of quality as a pornographic film form the 1970's.  As an aside here: the widespread notion that there are girls trying to be one of the guys, ""posers"", is an idea cooked up by insecure people who want to put other people down, and who are frustrated with their own social lives.  That meme about the poser nerd girl is the prime example.   Yes, there are posers in the world, but there are just as many male posers as female (if not more, quite frankly).  Personally, I've known thousands of people in my life, and nobody faked their way around their passions or hobbies.  (At least, not more than the normal way that all human beings ""put-on"" to some extent, socially and culturally.)  But it's mind-boggling to contemplate how the script and the vocal performance was allowed into the game.  Especially when you can't turn off or skip past the commentary in-game.  Especially when Horizon 1 did it so much better."
forza,3bo8qz,CoconutDust,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:37:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's the actor's fault. My issue with the way she's portrayed in the game doesn't have anything to do with her in real life.   Voice acting is hard. Selling a believable personality is even harder. In my opinion, the discussion concerning voice acting for the FH2 mechanic was about as simple as ""let's use a woman, and be done with it"". She doesn't sound interested in cars. And every time she greets me as ""dude"", I cringe."

The actor simply did what they hired/appointed her to do.  They could have coached her or hired someone else, but they chose not to."

They put the available championships on the table and expect you to have a car that works for one of them.

forza,3bo8qz,IceMan_PJN,0,Tue Jun 30 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"Less cars, less tracks, no auction house or storefront, only marginally improved graphics... Was F5 a let down?   Less cars and tracks were mandatory unless they doubled development time on the game, which would make it less financially viable.  Double development time would mean double the development cost but the same MSRP.  Keep in mind, when a player buys a $60 game, the developers normally get about $15 to $20 of that.  The graphics weren't marginally improved.  The number of cars on screen increased by 33%, the polygon detail of cars and environments were increased, textures and effects were increased, and they added stuff like reflections on windshields.  The bottom line is it was an improvement, but it's also worth noting that it was a launch title and launch titles generally fall pretty short of games a year or two later.  In some ways, 2013's FM5 outperforms 2015's Project CARS, like higher resolution and consistent frame rate.  You can't expect a day-one launch title to really push the hardware.  As for auction house and storefront, there's no denying these things were a step back, though players ruined the auction house anyway."

It seems like a case of The Marketers Wanted To Write It On The Back Of A Box disease.  (ALSO SEE:  getting blinded by the glare of the sun.  I like a simulation but we don't need to simulate burned retinas.)  The developers seem to focus intently on gloss instead of (relatively smaller?) items that a wide consensus of players would agree are important.  Sector times, qualifying sessions, public custom lobbies, the list goes on...  These are crucial things that fundamentally affect the racing/driving/playing experience.  But they went and worked on things like ""Physical Materials Modelling"" which has no consequence other than that our hood ornaments and brake calipers look glamorous when photographed with 4x zoom.

forza,3bo8qz,Nomnom_downvotes,0,Wed Jul 1 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"I would like to step in and say something, as an avid forza fan from the very beginning.  Here are my thoughts on each forza game from 1-5:  Forza 1: Best soundtrack, loved the atmospheric classic rock that played in the garage, really got me in the racing mood. Reminded me of that classic 90s racing atmosphere, this game was about racing, plain and simple.   The unlock system made me work hard and race to get those cars I desperately wanted in my garage, and left that mystery to what cars were in the game that had yet to be unlocked. Leveling in this game MEANT something. And you had to work hard and race hard to buy your cars. Cant speak for the online side as I did not have xbox live on the original xbox. Also worth noting I thought the nationality system was very cool.  Forza 2: Easily my favorite of the entire series. The soundtrack was meh, but it stuck with me. Again, you had to work HARD to get the cars you wanted, it was not an easy process, and I LOVED it. Especially when I went online with it, it meant something to have a nice, well thought out car that you put effort into earning. Of course, the online got me sucked into the drifting scene, which was HUGE in those days and leading into forza 3 (The forums and drifting explosion are the reason forza 3 has drifting mechanics!)  Forza 3: I greatly enjoyed this game, the soundtrack was phenomenal and reminded me of the classic gran turismo atmospheric style music, but lacked the racing soul the first one had. It honestly felt like an extension of 2, only it was far easier due to the massive influx of free reward cars, etc.  Forza 4: I left the xbox scene and came back around midway of the lifecycle for 4, but still put plenty of time into it and rather enjoyed it. However, this game felt WAY too easy. I was starting to have concerns by now of the direction the franchise was headed. Also, the soundtrack was like 3 but different, so eh.  Forza 5: Graphically, this is my favorite forza in terms of looks. Driving engine, once again this is my favorite. Soundtrack is utter garbage, I hate it for some inexplicable reason. Car list left something to be desired, but still solid.   Menu design, terrible. This is one of the weaker forza games for me, down there with forza horizon 1 and forza 4 for weakness. WAY too easy, cars are free if they are dlc, wtf? And you get free credits everywhere with forza rewards now! Still, I play this game ALOT.  Here is to hoping that Forza 6 captures the racing soul the original forza had. I miss that feeling, I felt like a true race driver and mechanic, every time I was in the menus of forza 1 I felt like I was in the garage at the paddocks preparing my race car."
forza,3bo8qz,kidstandout,-5,Wed Jul 1 17:36:16 2015 UTC,"It was. It was a huge let down. Let's be honest, Forza isn't an actual racing sim compared to something like AC or iRacing, what makes Forza shine above 90% of other racing games is the customisation and the community. With the storefront and AH being removed (not to mentioned the lack of content to use those features with) it felt like the community had just disappeared. I love Forza, it's the reason i got my 360 and the reason i got the XB1, but Forza 5 felt more like one of GT's prologue games with a bit more flesh."
forza,3bo8qz,Nomnom_downvotes,2,Thu Jul 2 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"forza isn't a racing sim? the tire physics alone make that statement objectively false. compared to pc sims like AC or IR forza is more of a car simulator in that it doesn't simulate all racing conditions ie pit strategy, flags ect. but as far as consoles go it's the be all end of racing sims. customization is a big feature in forza, probably one of it's biggest. but sim aspect was always forza's bread and butter."

In terms of realism Forza physics are not even close to AC, RF2, iR etc. I love Forza, it literally is my favourite console game but it's not a true sim no matter how you look at it. It's the absolute perfect ""simcade"" game. Not a full sim, nor is it full arcade, it uses realistic principles with the combined accessibility of a more arcadey game."
forza,3bo8qz,Nomnom_downvotes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:01:56 2015 UTC,"saying forza is not a true sim on the basis that it doesn't compare to pc sims doesn't change the fact that as far consoles go, it's sim racer. it's not that hard a concept to grasp.  the degree of simulation forza has comparible to other sims doesn't negate that it simulates an overwhelming majority of car phenomenons. the only arcade aspect are the assists and fictional race tracks, which account for so little of what the game offers.  go to the gtplanet forums and try argue this drivel and even fans of iracing and AC will laugh at you. forza isn't either of the games but for consoles, it's as close as you can get."
forza,3bo8qz,Cartime,0,Wed Jul 1 09:28:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, it's a very basic ""sim"". A simcade, like i said.."
forza,3bo8qz,Nomnom_downvotes,0,Wed Jul 1 20:08:26 2015 UTC,Forza is simcade. It's an arcadey game with sim aspects.

forza,3bp63r,Gunslinger_Ted,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"I'll give that a try. I tend to stay away from AWD swaps, but in this case the R500 NEEDS it."
forza,3bp63r,milehighmischief,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:51:57 2015 UTC,Thank you for the suggestion. I took your advice and it totally improved the stability and driving dynamics of the R500 to what we would have originally wanted from the car. The added weight and traction combined with the racing aero gear and rollcage turned my R500 into a monster that totally excells in the Track-Toy category. I don't have to worry about the ass end kicking out under intense cornering and the minor understeer from the front wheels during accelerated corners perfectly balances out the oversteer to allow for very precise cornering and lightning quick steering feedback.

forza,3bgzbm,SirNLeo,4,Tue Jun 30 11:55:10 2015 UTC,What was it? The CR-X that destroyed everything? I remember there was a version of Forza where the CR-X was the clear choice on the leaderboard for several classes. And I think that was on 2.

forza,3bgzbm,rukarioz,4,Mon Jun 29 13:56:39 2015 UTC,CR-X domination was the original Forza. You could also destroy class C with an Evo with a simple tune.

forza,3bgzbm,chase817,3,Mon Jun 29 04:31:46 2015 UTC,"FM2 had the best non-crash damage modeling in the series, IMO. I'd prefer an option for even more damage from routine racing, but still, it was way better than FM3 and FM4. In FM4 you can't really damage you car short of bumping into stuff and downshifting while on redline."
forza,3bgzbm,Dimonte,4,Mon Jun 29 07:34:29 2015 UTC,"made me realize that Turn10 kinda stopped giving what we want.   They gave some people what they wanted.  We got short races because some ADD players couldn't stand to go through eight or ten laps, and Turn 10 evidently listened and gave them what they wanted.  We also get DLC cars for 0 CR now because ""we paid real money for them"" even though we also paid real money for non-DLC cars.  Technically, when I get FM6, all 450 of the cars on day one will be DLC cars that I paid real money for because to get Ultimate I'm going to have to download the game, making it DLC, and I'm paying real money for it, so by community logic I shouldn't have to use CR for any car in the game.  They also listened to players whining about needing to grind for money so now I've got 40 million CR in FM5 after owning at least one of every car, and sometimes two or three."
forza,3bgzbm,IceMan_PJN,4,Mon Jun 29 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'll say this, removing long-lap races at the same time as introducing a rewind feature was really strange.  It seems like the rewind feature definitely solves the biggest complaint of long-lap races, which is ""I just raced for 45 minutes and my cat jumped on me and I crashed in the final hairpin and now I am re-evaluating my entire video game playing life because what the fuck man"".  That said, even with rewind, I am grateful that I can pretty much complete Forza games without any of these marathon races.  It's just not my thing, going round the same circuit for that long. I get pretty stir crazy after just a few laps. Sorry if we ruined it for you, mate :)  I think that the forza games should always include a 'endurance' segment that is mostly optional but provides great benefits for folks who prefer that."
forza,3bgzbm,Kiggsworthy,5,Mon Jun 29 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"As much as I like the rewind feature (saves time and you could fix small mistakes), I also dislike it so much because it makes the winning and the reward much more cheap. Restarting a race from the beginning sucks, but you do learn a lot more and helps you improve to get better lap times by going over the track multiple times. Whether it's hitting the apex better or figuring out when to slow down when reaching a turn. Rather than just, ""oops. Let me just rewind aannnnd there."""
forza,3bgzbm,WOW_SUCH_KARMA,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:56:45 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you about the perplexing timing of the addition of rewind with the removal of it's main benefit. One of the leaked screenshots showed an endurance racing category in FM6. Only time will tell if this means 8-10 laps ala the online hoppers dubbed ""endurance"" racing, or if this will be a true return to multi-hour marathons of old. I'm hoping for the latter."

I actually like racing to earn the money to buy the cars I want, and if I boot the game up for the first time and I have millions of credits just for playing previous forza titles, it kinda ruins it for me. Anyone else feel that way?  Back on forza 4 I had put many hours into that game, was working on completing all of the events separately, my course of action was:  See event requirements, buy car from requisite car list, upgrade, tune, paint, murder the event list for events fitting that car, rinse and repeat. I'd have a garage filled with unique cars that i built and /earned/, then later on down the line, the ""money glitch"" happened to me. I went to collect about $20k from the marketplace for one of my paints, and next thing I know my credits read: 999,999,999,999. No kidding. This was a real thing check the forums. Eventually the game got patched and it put me down to 99,999,999 which is still insane.   Not gonna lie it kinda ruined the game for me, don't get me wrong obviously I still liked racing and painting and tuning but the sense of accomplishment from doing the career mode was gone. I feel like starting FM6 with millions of credits and exotic cars would ruin it in a way. I understand you have the choice to not accept the rewards and you bet I will do that, but I just really wish FM would eventually do a compelling career mode, I miss the career mode in GT games of old, those were really worth putting MANY hours into."

I get to that point in Forza anyway but it doesn't kill the gameplay factor for me. On Horizon 2 I have like 350 cars with an extra 12mil in credits with 500+ hours logged on the game and I still play it almost every day. It's more about the cars for me anyway for the most part.

If your profile had a Forza 3 save on your Xbox, Forza 4 just gave you a few cars right of the start.  At least one of them was a Unicorn car.  For me personally, since online was why I played Forza, the game didn't really start until I had enough Cr to pay for whatever silly idea I had, or whatever car was going to kick ass in this months rivals races."

forza,3b7mph,Novacht,2,Fri Jun 26 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah they said the basics.  I'll explain a little more in depth.  Your tires can handle 100% friction. If you are braking, you are using, let's say 75%. Now you only have 25%, a fourth if what you had before, to turn. So now you can't steer as sharp without sliding.  If you are braking and turning and start to skid towards the outside of the turn, release the brake a little bit, or as necessary, and you can regain the steering to make the turn.  The best way to overcome the loss of control is to slow down before you get to the turn so that you can devote all of the friction to turning"

forza,3bbct4,jwikked,2,Mon Jun 29 19:09:12 2015 UTC,"I'll share in your joy. I can't wait for the game to come out! As long as you can pay your bills and adequately support your family (and the wife says it's ok), I think it's good for married people to be able to treat themselves here and there.  Just put the family first, then if there is disposable income, the couple can decide if it's OK to buy a little something."
forza,3bbct4,steve_jahbs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"I hate to break it to you about wheels.   But the cheapest Force Feedback wheel for xbox one is gonna set you back more than the console itself.  I think both the ~$ 330Thrusmaster 448 Italia wheel and the upcoming G920 are both going to be ~$400 usd...    Its complete bullshit that logitech went the route of making a new, $400 clone (minus the shift too!) of the $230 g27 rather than being willing to write a driver for the xbox one.    Sadly it seems decisions by the peripheral makers to cut the bottom end off the driving sim controller market, means you need to budget about $450 to 500 to have a wheel for xbox one with force feedback.  Because you need a wheel, but then you also need a stand so $40 to DIY or $100-200 to buy one.   Thrusmaster easily runs you up over $500 if you want a clutch and a shifter.   Other makers go even farther.  Like Fanatic's xbox one compatible wheel is their primo-high end kit which will easily set you back about $1000...  The nice and affordable CSR or porsche branded wheels?  Incompatible!    PS  The way you save money is put the money away from saving the second you get paid, then spend on other things, including bills later.  If you spend then try and save you will always find you somehow have nothing left to save, but if take out ahead you always somehow manage to get by with a little less."

forza,3b9vyx,TheAsianTroll,2,Sat Jun 27 17:00:38 2015 UTC,The M6 was a pre order bonus that recently was released in the Pre-Order Car Pack. To buy the M6 you must buy that pack.
forza,3b9vyx,RangeRoverHSE,2,Sat Jun 27 04:46:59 2015 UTC,"After buying the pre-order car pack with real money, you can get each of the cars free in-game one time.  So the first M6 will be free, but future ones will cost in-game credits."

forza,3b74xa,Driffel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:45:37 2015 UTC,Stability and traction control get in the way. ABS helps a lot though especially when you are coming into a corner.
forza,3b74xa,aurorafluxic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:35:29 2015 UTC,"I personally feel like the best way to play the Forza games (once you're ready, of course) is to turn off all the assists except for the braking line (which you'll need until you learn each track).   You just get such a deeper and more sensitive connection to what your car is doing that way."
forza,3b74xa,Oriole5,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:30:18 2015 UTC,I had the same feeling when I took the leap from automatic to manual with clutch. I couldn't believe how much of a difference it made braking into and coming out of corners. I also wondered why I could never have good drifts and then I realized it was because I had traction control on and it would cut power to the wheels. Turning off the handicaps makes the game much more enjoyable.
forza,3b74xa,PYSHINATOR,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"You speak the truth. I've been running with no assists since FM3 and doing so allows the car's suspension and transmission to do their jobs without interference. Another suggestion - if your cars are equipped with racing transmission components and suspension work is to tweak the setups to optimize acceleration and roadholding. I would suggest downloading ForzaTune5 if possible, for it runs the calculations of the suspension geometry and differential ratios based on the car's parameters. The gear ratios are up to your own discretion, because it gives you a calculated acceleration time for every adjustment you make."
forza,3b74xa,JK07,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:43:53 2015 UTC,"Bloody hell,  I didn't realise anyone in this sub actually had those turned on. It's soooo much better with them off.   You manual already yeah? A good tip to go manual with clutc h is to map the clutch to A then you can change gear with just your thumb and now you have the assists tuned off you will be able to initiate drifts using the clutch!"
forza,3b74xa,aurorafluxic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:18:03 2015 UTC,I personally love using A for clutch and the bumpers for shifting.

No.  There's a lot more to Forza than just being ""fully upgraded."" We can have the same car with same PI, but that doesn't make them the same.  You need the right combination of performance upgrades.  If you're using driver aids against a skilled player without aids, he will be faster too because aids slow you down. Tuning also helps, and tuning isn't the same as upgrading.  Tuning parts have settings that can be changed, like suspension stiffness, wheel camber, orgear ratios, and a good setup can make the difference."
forza,3b1cv1,IceMan_PJN,2,Thu Jun 25 04:44:13 2015 UTC,Thank you! So much to look at.
forza,3b1cv1,RapidKiller1392,3,Thu Jun 25 04:48:04 2015 UTC,He is correct the PI is just numbers. Just because a car is at a certain PI doesn't mean that it's faster than all the cars lower than it. It's really confusing but you start to notice it. You have to have a balance of the different components. Race tires might bring your C class up to an A class but you'll still be far slower because your engine is still stock and still makes the same C class type power.

forza,3awfk2,Jabowalkie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:18:39 2015 UTC,Thank you that helped alot
forza,3awfk2,IceMan_PJN,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:49:33 2015 UTC,"I've had the TX since March so I can maybe help you out.  Honestly if you can buy the base separately that would be better. The stock wheel it comes with is OK but it's mostly made of plastic so the build quality doesn't have that ""premium"" look that you would expect from something blessed off by Ferrari.   There's rubber grips on the sides of the wheel that's made from that same kind of rough rubber that you'll find on some push brooms, the kind that rubs off on your hands after extended use.  There's plenty of buttons on the wheel but unfortunately some of them do the same thing as other buttons, for example the button with the suspension shock on it is just another A button. If you use it with a PC then it's an entirely separate button. Even with Project Cars with its custom button mapping the ""duplicate buttons"" are still there  With the pedals the accelerator feels a bit cheap, and by that I mean that there's no meat to the travel. It's really light kinda like what you'd find in an arcade. The brake pedal is a bit stiffer but it feels like they should have put the stiffness of the brake pedal into the accelerator. Also no clutch pedal  Other than those small gripes, the feel of driving with the wheel is fantastic. I have mine set to 900° and 60% FFB. Playing with a controller just isn't the same anymore. If you're looking into building a quality setup try and just get the wheel base and buy other addons to go with that but if you're just looking for a cheap wheel the TX will entertain you well enough. Just make sure you have a desk/table or anything of the sorts to mount it on, the FFB is too active to play it unsecured."
forza,3awfk2,Jabowalkie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:10:49 2015 UTC,First day with the wheel omg is it a learning curve. A tip for any force feedback wheel have a good base to attach it too and dont use lunch snack trays! As soon as I have a solid setup it will be great. played project cars on the computer it was fantastic. easy to install and setup and was very fun to use. Now its all about reps with it!
forza,3avv6t,Jabowalkie,3,Tue Jun 23 22:34:15 2015 UTC,"I found out that this will not be an option and I'm pretty down about it. I feel like they're taking too much away from this game.   Players ruined the auction house.  I liked the auction house during the first few days after release, before players started ruining it.  I liked the auction house as a way to get cars at a lower price, but eventually the Walmart Supercenter players start stockpiling inventory, buying up twenty of the same car all at once, even if it means running the price of every one of those up to 99% of retail, or sometimes over 100% of value, just so they can re-list them later at inflated prices.  There were loads of cars on the market priced above value.  Why on Earth would I pay you 1,200,000 CR for a car worth 1,000,000?  Even the guys flipping twenty of the same car below retail; why should I bother with the auction house when you flood it with your resale cars you've priced for 999,900 that are worth 1,000,000?  It's not worth it to save 100 CR on a million-CR car.  I just want one of such-and-such car, not to flip for profit but for my collection and use, but I have to sit through bid wars with Walmart Guy buying up all 23 of that car listed at that moment.  He doesn't need or want 23 of that car, but rather just wants merchandise to mark up and resell later."
forza,3avv6t,IceMan_PJN,2,Wed Jun 24 07:41:37 2015 UTC,I understand this but that's how every market works in life. I mainly used the auction house to sell my tunes for drifting and also my really good paint jobs. It was fun to see the use a market style within a game. I know it wont come back but I want that competitive sale of tunes and paint jobs. Now we cant even race for pinks like we used to. sucks.

Most tracks are mainly offroad too. Obviously, you'll just have to learn how to be quick. If you really want to improve and you have a lot of patience you should try running some rivals events. I find that hot-lapping is one of the best ways to improve your skill. It helps to know the track plus you see how the ghost takes the best cuts possible for the best times. Hope that helps!"

If you can buy it for $20, then $20 is all you have to pay.  The other stuff is 100% purely optional and nobody ever had to buy it.   If you want to buy a 2016 Mustang from a Ford dealer and it's $23,000, you can buy just that and don't need to shell out $50,000 for the Mustang Shelby GT350 or $63,500 for the GT350R.

I figured getting my feet wet with 5 and waiting for 6 to drop in price and/or eventually get a re-release with additional content would be the best way to go.

They'll offer the basic version of the game on disc because they have to, but they certainly don't want to give you any incentive to buy it. Sure, it could happen, but I wouldn't count on it."

forza,3abxuo,TonySki,2,Fri Jun 19 04:49:16 2015 UTC,What was it we had in forza 4?
forza,3abxuo,nickrod8698,2,Fri Jun 19 04:56:06 2015 UTC,It was an older stock car style that hadn't been used since 2006. NASCAR had brought out the Car Of Tomorrow in 2007 and since it was the NASCAR R&D Center that had developed the shape and design of the car they owned the rights to it so if you didn't have the NASCAR licence you didn't have a current stock car in your game.
forza,3abxuo,jrodx88,2,Fri Jun 19 05:03:25 2015 UTC,"Hell, I'd be even happy with an older-style stock car like PCARS has, but with Forza's vinyl system.  That said, since no one holds and exclusive deal with NASCAR anymore, it's totally possible that we could see Gen-6 cars. I just hope there's something. Assuming the previous tracks from Forza 5 carry over, we'll have plenty of tracks NASCAR races on (Sonoma, Road America, Watkins Glen, Indy & Daytona)."

forza,3ada2a,ewise623,5,Fri Jun 19 04:25:11 2015 UTC,"""Forza 6 is exactly what you want: a faster, prettier Forza with rain and night driving.""  That headline is pretty presumptuous.  I've played Horizon 1, Forza 5, and Horizon 2 for many many hours.  Fastness and prettiness is really not important at all.  Well, it's a little bit important, but we've reached a pretty satisfying level of speed and graphics.  What's important is:   Actual gameplay Sector times Better more comprehensive tracking of lap times while you practice Improved customization system (the file/save system for liveries, for example, is awful) Better marketplace.  Forza 5 and Horizon 2 were a huge step backward from Horizon 1's market. More interesting campaign events or situations, etc.  How does Forzavista get development priority over this? Improved menu and interface design.  Menus that are not terrible GUI design.  Example:  Currently you have to sit there for 2 minutes scrolling down a ""line"" of a hundred paint designs, or tracks, or cars.  (LB/RB are particularly awkward buttons for extra scrolling.)    Plus, when you reach the ""end"" of a scrolling menu, you cannot skip back to the other side!   It HURTS. The solution: put acceleration on the scroll, and let us ""roll"" up or down for categories. Faster menus.  It's painfully slow to click around your Upgrades, etc. Not winning a ""Gold"" medal for 3rd place. A soundtrack that is better than Forza 5.  Much better. Better penalty system for crashers. Fewer pay-out screens between races.  This wastes time that could be spent racing. MORE RACING, LESS menus and loading. More tracks.  Tracks are more important than fetish-perfect hood ornaments and shifting knobs.  Less time/labor spent on Forzavista, and more time spent on The Actual Game. More details here.   I can't see how a person who plays a lot of Forza would prioritize increased ""prettiness"" or ""fastness"" over these points above, or why someone who plays the game would write a headline about that.  I can see how a journalist or casual player who does not actually play much Forza would care about quote unquote Fastness & Prettiness.  ""Faster"" should immediately make an actual Forza player think ""Finally:  fewer Payout screens to waste my time between races!""."

forza,3aam47,frizbe21,2,Thu Jun 18 21:47:12 2015 UTC,Forza 4 had triple screen capabilities but you had to have 3 xbox's and 3 copies of the game. I watched a video and the guy said that that triple screen setup was specifically for e3 and won't be possible in the retail version.

forza,3a81em,Shock_and_Awwwwww,2,Thu Jun 18 03:44:16 2015 UTC,"very annoying detail they missed on fm5. i always look at the suggested cars they have to use before the championship, and whatever car is the highest PI of the class, i assume i can only get max PI of that specific class.  for example, theyll suggest 6 cars. 4 of them are mid-range C class, and 2 of them are mid range B class. ill go and buy my own car, and upgrade it how i want and max out PI out of the B class--if i were to reach A class, i'd be too powerful.  make sense? still annoying though."

forza,3a81em,SFWarriorsfan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:33:56 2015 UTC,"Why don't you like upgrading your cars? If you were to track a car in real life, you would most likely upgrade it. The point of racing is to be competitive."
forza,3a81em,RodRAEG,-4,Thu Jun 18 02:13:23 2015 UTC,"Because if I'm driving an M3 for instance and I see a Shelby Mustang ahead of me I like knowing that I won't be able to catch him on the next straight but when we hit that corner I'll get my chance. I pace myself and race based on what I know the capabilities of the car I'm driving to be vs. those I am racing against. I like selecting the car I'm going to use based on the configuration of the track. The upgrade system throws all that out the window and basically makes every car the same. If all cars have a PI of 800, what's the point?"
forza,3a81em,RodRAEG,2,Thu Jun 18 02:28:21 2015 UTC,"It puts more focus on driving ability than relying on the car, for one. Even then, just because a PI is 800 doesn't mean all the cars are the same. You can reach 800 doing a speed build, a grip build, a drift build, or something inbetween, and there's still going to be some inherent differences in the way the cars perform because they're different."
forza,3a81em,alcoslushies,-2,Thu Jun 18 02:34:13 2015 UTC,True and that's fine if you are one who likes upgrading. I really think that there should be an option so that you can choose whether your opponents are going to be upgraded to the top of whatever class you are racing or not. That way we can both have it the way we like it.
forza,3a81em,ShantJ,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:00:17 2015 UTC,"I did like some of the races in horizon 1, like stock American muscle only or spend 10k credits on upgrades.   Not sure if FM6 will have those, I doubt it, but it was an interesting way to shake things up."
forza,3a79tm,gne1217,6,Wed Jun 17 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"Forza Motorsport leans more towards simulation racing than the Horizon offshoots. If you think Horizon if repetitive Motorsport might not be for you. However, that repetition comes in the form of more structured racing. You race on tracks instead of having an open world where you can plow a hypercar with 4 inches of ground clearance through a corn field, the physics are less forgiving. Rumble strips hate low cars. Tuning is much more important, clean racing is much more important, holding proper lines is much more important, bouncing off walls or other racers is way, way less important (and frowned upon). I enjoy Motorsport more and only picked Horizon up again last night to stack up my Forza Rewards and tiers. (Gotta get that free money and cars in Forza 6!) I think 24 bucks is a fair price for the game. Again, be warned, the game is repetitive, it's circuit racing. There's no story to speak of and there is a learning curve but the game will reward work you put in; learning how to tune, learning the lines, learning to race without assists, learning to navigate traffic, etc. You could try it for a month and if you don't like it XBox will refund your money (or so I'm told.)     Hell, look up YouTube videos to get a taste of Motorsport. RotKing and MoneyMan300 might be good places to start, though both have recently moved over to Project Cars."
forza,3a79tm,JamesTBagg,2,Wed Jun 17 20:18:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth 23.99. I think it's easier to get burned out in F5 compared to FH2, but that's just my opinion. I find the open roads addictive.  Switching between the two should offer you enough variance."
forza,3a79tm,namepitched,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say go for the deal, it's a good price. If you're a bit burned out on Horizon 2 right now, you'd probably enjoy the change of scenery to dedicated tracks. Forza 5 requires much more precision than Horizon 2; the physics are less forgiving, and the tracks leave you with less room to operate than the open world."
forza,3a79tm,milehighmischief,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:07:54 2015 UTC,The switch from 30FPS to 60FPS is worth the price of entry. It always shocks me when I switch back to the Motorsport series after I've been playing Horizon for a while.

This has been the only game I have consistently played throughout the 18 months of owning the Xbox One. There are so many cars to race that you don't get bored racing. The number of tracks is kind of small, but the many cars handle them differently so it doesn't feels as repetitive. For 24 bucks, I would highly recommend this game. It'll help you prepare for Forza 6 if you plan on getting that game. Just checked and I've logged 60 hours of racing and I'm lvl 252 so I've played this game quite a bit."

T10 didn't like that and unless they can find a way to prevent this indefinitely I don't see the storefront coming back.  I however did love the storefront and hope that they will be able to bring it back eventually.

forza,3a72q7,ArcticFoxNews,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:12:02 2015 UTC,Still it was a vulnerability.  It is also the reason you can't sell cars because people  would gift you expensive cars that you could sell to get extra money.

My twin brother and I like to do racing challenges where we restrict ourselves to A or B class, then whoever picks the track picks the first car, while the person who doesn't pick first gets the advantage of knowing the track and the car. So If we pick a car with one straight, but moderate amount of curves, one of us might go for high braking and top speed but low acceleration, while the other goes for quick acceleration but low top end, etc.  Where as with S class you just have the tuning powerhouse to try to do all three areas."

forza,3a1ncf,mjike,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:38:12 2015 UTC,No idea... Why on earth would you want to?
forza,3a1ncf,EvSauce7,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:55:48 2015 UTC,Digital versions aren't ever an option for me due to terribly craptacular internet. A typical 20gb game takes at minimum 7 days unless everyone else in the house ceases to use the internet until the download is complete so I always have to go with physical copies. That doesn't mean I wouldn't be willing to spend $20 bucks to not have to swap discs on a game I still play many hours a week.
forza,3a23t9,skfraz,7,Tue Jun 16 17:05:58 2015 UTC,"I like the loyalty rewards, but part of me also likes grinding through the career mode to save up and buy the cars I want. I don't want everything handed to me as soon as I put in the game."

forza,3a23t9,Gordonphan24,2,Tue Jun 16 17:36:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly. My first game was FM3 and grinding through the races and balancing saving my money with upgrading my current one made it challenging and made me want to play it for hours. I also loved the achievement in FH3 for completing all of the championships. It gave a nice end goal to work towards and when you got it, it showed that you were a serious player."

forza,39xn37,aphd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:42:47 2015 UTC,Focusing on the wheel controls is understandable but the next best and cheapest control scheme (that most players will use) for any version of the game is the controller. It is a wonder why the controller setup is so bad then.

forza,39xn37,steve_jahbs,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"Well I can theoretically see how it went under the radar. The steering glitch with a controller really is only noticeable if you are oversteering.

forza,39xn37,ltc5000,12,Mon Jun 15 19:14:54 2015 UTC,I really hope that they do something about crashers if they're going to have 24 people in a lobby in multiplayer. That just sounds like a recipe for first corner apocalypse on every race rather than first corner disaster every few races if you know what I mean.  They really need to get some sort of race steward engine in the multiplayer system.
forza,39xn37,Kezika,8,Mon Jun 15 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"I liked doing the online ""track days""  people did in Forza 4 which was basically just a time attack, there'd be one safety car that everyone would follow for the initial lap then the driver would go hang out off the track until someone wrecked.  That helped a lot in the racing, and it was a lot of fun."
forza,39xn37,scoby_do,6,Mon Jun 15 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"Forza really should take the charge and solve this, because it plagues all race games.  Hell, I'd even enjoy if they took the GTA approach and put a dunce cap on the roof of the driver's car and pooled all the poor drivers together.  Poor drivers, intentional and unintentional, should be forced into a ghost-like state until they can prove they can drive in a clean fashion. If the nose of the car continues to intersect with the bumpers of others, it perpetuates how long they are locked into that ghost-state.   As things stand now, 24 players does not excite me, it just means more chaos at turn 1."
forza,39xn37,namepitched,6,Mon Jun 15 21:10:38 2015 UTC,"from wired.com   The leagues allow drivers with similar temperament and skill levels to play together, so guys and gals who really want to race clean don’t have to deal with players driving in the wrong direction, for example. Turn 10 has done a lot of research into the ways gamers play Forza, from those who just want to jump into multiplayer and drive around to guys who will spend hours testing and perfecting their rides, adjusting everything from tire pressure to gearing to suspension travel.   Also Dan explains it in this interview"
forza,39xn37,Chippy569,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:46:51 2015 UTC,Linking to the part of the video you spoke of: https://youtu.be/w-RUYmxFT_w?t=496  Hopefully the league system delivers. We'll just have to wait and see. Thanks for the heads up. It's also cool to hear the reasoning behind the tires being located where they are. When I saw the video I couldn't understand why tires would be placed in such a location on a track.
forza,39xn37,namepitched,0,Tue Jun 16 04:00:26 2015 UTC,"I get it you want this league system to be the bee's knees Dan but seriously don't skirt the question by repeating it. I like racing just as much as the next guy but sometimes just rippin it down the Mulsanne straight with a group of people is more relaxing. Spontaneous car shows, tricks, roll racing, or just cruising, is an easier way to make friends online cause someone ising bitching about a wreck or what have it."
forza,39xn37,Brittle_Bones_Bishop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:29:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people always seem to say that it would be too hard to implement and stuff like that. Which of course you aren't going to get something that is 100% perfect, but even some % is better than the 0% that we have at the moment. Even a couple simple penalty conditions such as ""If you were in a braking zone and you hit another car because you didn't brake, penalty"" that kind of stuff.  Then you could build on that. Take the above penalty and monitor the car that you collided into. Collision is 1 second penalty. Now did they leave the track boundaries imminently after the collision? +5 seconds. Did they leave the track boundaries so severely that they slammed into a barrier? another +5. Did they spin out as well? +5.  That would take care at least of the rammers that ram to win the race. It wouldn't necessarily take care of the rammers that just like ramming for the sake of ramming however, but there is other stuff that could probably be done to deal with them such as some sort of ""average penalties per race"" matchmaking or something. Anyone remotely attempting to clean race would have nowhere near the same amount of average penalties as a dedicated rammer."
forza,39xn37,Kezika,23,Mon Jun 15 22:24:56 2015 UTC,Not really gameplay is it. This means nothing until they show how the actual game play looks like.

Unless Dan is on stage with a controller in hand, it is not game play.   I don't have an xbone because Forza 5 really didn't look that great. I knew it was a launch game and couldn't seriously blame T10, but now I can. 450 Forza Vista cars? Fuck Forza Vista. I don't want a god damned tour of some car, I want to fucking launch it at ludicrous speeds up and down Fuji. I used FV once in FM4 and I wish I didn't."
forza,39xn37,psw1994,32,Mon Jun 15 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"450 Forza Vista cars?   That's commenting on the level of detail for the cars in the game. All the cars in Forza 5 were ""forzavista"" level of detail. So for Forza 6 this means they are continuing to keep that level of detail, and have upped the car count considerably. FM5 only had like 300? cars after DLC (200 in the base game)? That means that there are 150ish more cars in the base Forza 6  game than Forza 5 had with DLC."
forza,39xn37,K2TheM,3,Mon Jun 15 17:45:23 2015 UTC,"Now are they 450 FULL Forzavista cars? On Forza 5 you couldn't open everything on every car, usually it was just the doors and that's it, only certain cars let you open all of it"

forza,39xn37,K2TheM,2,Mon Jun 15 21:16:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I know about the swap thing but I was talking about like the Integra and the E39 where it would only allow you to open the front doors regardless if the car was stock or not

Ok, you do realize right that you can drive those cars too? People who want a tour can get a tour, and people who don't want a tour don't have to have the tour, just like Forza 5 all cars in Forza 6 will be detailed enough for Forzavista."

I'll probably never own a Ferrari irl, but forza does an unbelievable job of letting me play pretend."
forza,39xn37,greymuse,3,Tue Jun 16 03:00:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. 26 tracks? Ans how many of them have we played in the last 5 forzas? At this point, I don't give a fuck. Make up a track. I've done 6 xhpionships in forza 5 so far, and 18 races per championship, I'm fucking sick of racing the same couple handfuls of tracks.  Take away 100-200 cars. Add 10-20 more tracks. That's one thing project cars got right atleast."

Being able to pump the wheels out a bit would make a drift tune so much better.

What I'm actually interested to see is how they have enhanced the gameplay experience at the multiplayer level. If they've found a unique solution to deal with people who crash, and crash often. A merit based system which includes you within a 'damage-on' environment or not.  Just my 02 cents."

forza,39xx2f,everyZig,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:38:22 2015 UTC,"FM4 took away a majority of the longer races, and although FM2 & FM3 still had endurance races, they broke tire and fuel wear so that it was too slow for any of the race lengths that were available to play.  FM1 on the original xbox had that stuff closer to right, had longer races, no rewinds, and actually had proper auto cross courses as opposed to the cone gate slaloms introduced as auto cross after they removed it for everything after the 1st game.  pCARS really isn't that amazing either, just happens to be the best representation of actual racing with flag rules and decent AI (outside of the F1 codies games) that has come over to console from the PC crowd.  Although it gets some of that stuff right, it's still not a proper sim experience, although it might be slightly more realistic than Forza in terms of physics and absolutely in terms of rules.  Flag rules and such should have been in Forza from the start, but the further they move from the Gran Turismo model of modifying cars with parts for a solid simcade experience, the further they move from captivating a majority of the mainstream audience."
forza,39xx2f,rexanimate7,0,Tue Jun 16 14:49:20 2015 UTC,"For all the bugs PCars has, it's a great focus on true motor sports. Forza needs to relax on the everyday cars and leave that for Horizon. Forza Motorsport needs to be just that, Motorsport."
forza,39xx2f,nolimit06,3,Mon Jun 15 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, part of me really is interested in pcars, but somehow i very much doubt ill like it half as much as Forza, i love motorsports, but part of that for me is having the authentic cars in there. I think FM6 will have a descent selection of racecars, i just hope its not too US centric (i really want a few GTE cars rather then american compos)  Also, they need to update some tracks, i just did some laps on le-mans and noticed its missing the friggin dunlop bridge"
forza,39xx2f,everyZig,2,Mon Jun 15 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"Project CARS is definitely worth a try if you want a true Motorsport game. And I agree on the cars. I actually watched the full 24 hours of Le Mans Saturday lol. And the track in Project CARS is damn near picture perfect. If you like Forza, you'll like Project CARS. It's definitely a bit more challenging, but it feels more rewarding and the helmet cam is great. I'm a Forza fan for life, been playing since the first but competition is great and forces Forza to change things up. Also PCars has a great community on their forums with constant updates from the devs, never seen interaction between devs and players like that."

I'm sure the excuse to not have dynamic lighting and weather is because they would have to test tires at 4pm in the wet, dry, semi-wet, etc. and again at 4:01pm. It really doesn't have to be that in depth. It's still just a game and has never been seen as THAT realistic to sim fans. No need to go that in depth on tire feel."
forza,39xx2f,FlutGOS,7,Mon Jun 15 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"Realistically, the excuse is because the resources dynamic lighting and weather would take up, I don't know about the Xbox One but on my PC playing Project CARS in the rain is a 20-25fps hit.  Forza's main focus is 1080p 60fps, and they've said that's not negotiable."
forza,39xx2f,Famine07,2,Mon Jun 15 20:48:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I can see that as well. I just played Project CARS on PC and the framerate does take a hit in the rain and with multiple vehicles. I have bought every forza since 2 at launch and this will be no different. It just seems like there is something that I am disappointed with after every release. The Horizon games have not disappointed me at all though and the 30 fps doesn't detract from it all. It just makes me wonder what could be done with the Motorsport series if they went to 30 fps.
forza,39xx2f,FlutGOS,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:59:27 2015 UTC,"well, at 108p i expect a lot better then 60fps  sorry i had to, i'll leave now"

Negotiations between Turn 10 and EA are going well, we're told, evinced a couple of weeks ago by the arrival of a Porsche DLC pack for Forza Horizon 2.   Too bad, but it's an appreciated clarification."

Any publisher or studio that wants Porsche in their racing game must negotiate a deal with EA. That's why you mostly see Porsche in Need for Speed only. I believe Turn 10 holds the license for Ferrari.

forza,39ybld,foxden_racing,3,Mon Jun 15 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"There are goods and bads.  The fact that they are sticking with the terrible download system of tunes and liveries is hugely disappointing.  I guess it means no auction house.   Listening to Dan talk about the puddles makes me think he's lost the narrative.  He's worried about things that don't make for a great racing.  In fact it sounds like it makes it less sim like.  I wish he would get that we want things like realistic pit strategies, realistic races, etc.  The fact that one of his big talking points in a game about racing is puddles and how some parts of the track will be undrivable in the rain is pretty discouraging.  Yes in a real race there is a line that develops in the rain but it appears the race line doesn't even dry out in the rain here, it's just wet.  That sucks pretty bad.  The fact that tunes carry over from FM5 means we are still stuck with the old slider tuning system which means no four corner tuning.  That sucks.    The cars and more tracks are good, the game I'm sure will look awesome so that's good, but the talk from my friends is that no one heard today what they wanted to hear, and that is Forza is moving back towards sim racing.  Instead it seems it's moving more towards the Horizon arcade style.    Maybe the weeks to come will reveal more of a push towards the simulator side but as for now I'm not sure it's even a purchase let alone a pre order."

A lot of what's up there is news to me, even though I'd watched the entire MS presentation.  You've got a couple good points, though...the FM5 ""storefront"" was junk compared to FM4's.  I understand why they did it...after 2 games they couldn't stop design theft and the like, and rather than abandoning the idea of selling one's work, they took their ball and went home...but still, it sucks. :("

I've always heard Fanatec make a great wheel (not for Xbox One) and that the Logitech G29 are far and above the best ones out there.    Where does Thrustmaster and Madcatz fit on this list? Would a Logitech G920 be comparable to a Thrustmaster assuming the G920 is made to the same standard of the G29?"
forza,39f3jr,RapidKiller1392,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:27:52 2015 UTC,"I have the TX but what you get in the base product isn't too great. The wheel seems cheaply made and the weird rubber just seems off. You don't get a clutch pedal either. $100 for a GTE leather wrapped rim, $150 for the 3 pedal set and $100 for the shifter. So you're looking at $650 for a good setup without getting a base or seat. Add another $450 for a playseat with the gearshift holder and I'm looking at a total cost of $1100 for the dream setup."

forza,39chph,justaplebian,2,Wed Jun 10 20:59:59 2015 UTC,"This is a really broad topic because of all the intricate parts, tuning settings and physics that make a car how it performs. I'll start by saying drift cars often have their engines mounted in the front of the car (sometimes middle) and send power to the rear wheels.  The engines in cars configured as such usually produce so much power that the rear wheels lose traction, making the tail of the car slide.  Tuning wise the differentials will be set to lock up very easily, and suspension is very stiff... and it gets much more complicated beyond that.    Grip cars are set up to do just the opposite - made for the car to stay glued to the road as much as possible.  Basic upgrades include better tire compounds, wider tire widths, front & rear spoilers/wings  As for what car to choose and modify/tune, you can pick just about anything you want and set it up however you want to.  Experiment away.  I think the R32 might be a 4 wheel drive (4wd) car, so you may want to convert it to a rwd if you want to make a drift car with it"
forza,39chph,very_crazy_idiot,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:35:45 2015 UTC,"The thing I'm not really knowledgeable about is suspension setups and how it changes the way the car behaves in relation to drifting. I have grip setups dialled, but really I'm absolutely clueless as to what changes to make for drifting."
forza,39chph,cfb_rolley,2,Thu Jun 11 03:17:36 2015 UTC,This guide explains what each tuning setting does What you're looking for is more oversteer if you want drift.
forza,39all5,ekb11,3,Wed Jun 10 13:16:40 2015 UTC,"Ah.  Me too, basically.  I can't get my RUF Yellowbird to turn.  What I already did was:   Maximized rear ride height, minimized the front Softened the front bump and stiffened the front rebound, to keep weight on the front as long as possible. Softened the front springs, of course. Turned the differential setting up, in order to help lose traction on rear and get some body rotation while turning.   Still pushes like heck when I'm trying to turn.  I have not sat down to do a rigorous and disciplined roll bar sweep.  I tried a few ""usual"" things to my roll bars, but it still takes turns like a brick shithouse.  Got to do a roll bar sweep, but I've been too lazy.  The elephant in the room here is the rear engine.  Quite literally, the rear engine is weighing down the back, while lifting up the front wheels, just like a heavy kid and a skinny kid on a see-saw.  Even if there's no visible lift.  Hence, less traction in the front for the wheels that need to grab the road to turn.  Plenty of traction in the rear to let loose on the straights and leave the competition in the dust.  But…I like turns.  Hairpins destroy my RUF.   It corners like a schoolbus.  As usual for suspension/balance issues, driving is often more important than tuning.  Be sure to brake at the latest possible point, and trail brake into the turn, to maximize weight transfer to the front (thus more traction) while turning.  On one hand, in my opinion, rear engined cars are hollow exercises in getting your ""pamphlet numbers up"" in order to boast about straight line acceleration.  On the other hand, they're kind of made for master drivers who trail brake perfectly, I suppose, which is neat.  If anyone has some tips or ideas I haven't thought of, I'd be glad to hear."
forza,39all5,CoconutDust,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:54:25 2015 UTC,When tuning the standard 911 body types in forza try raising the front springs to like 1K or more in the front and a few hundred less in the rear. Adjust the shocks to get the maximum travel distance (varies upon weight).  I can list my other settings but the spring rates will help the most with turn in and out.  I've been on ESO lately but if anyone wants help tuning or just wants to race (any class) to feel free to send me a message or friend request.
forza,39all5,WtFxMintBerry,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't even driven the rufs in 5 yet but from experience you need to turn differently, brake late to have your apex mid lane instead of on the apex and initiate turn in while still braking. It is allot like a muscle car you won't turn so much as rotate and accelerate."
forza,39all5,drakesdoom,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"The thing with the porsches is that they will generally understeer on throttle, and will have a good amound of lift-off oversteer. set the brake bias slightly favoring the rear, so that the front wheels will lock up less while turning, and try trail braking into the corners, that should alleviate exessive understeer. you could also max out the front tire width, and minimize rear tire width. or set rear tire pressure very high, while keeping front tire pressure the same. Good Luck! edit: also try making the rear arb stiffer than the front bar."

forza,396plr,Speedi77,3,Tue Jun 9 17:53:59 2015 UTC,I wonder if this is a side effect of EA Access? I really didn't think there was any way T10 and EA could come to an agreement for a Porsche license the year NFS is being rebooted.   Maybe we'll get lucky and get a larger Porsche DLC for FM6.
forza,396plr,Sub116610,3,Tue Jun 9 18:09:10 2015 UTC,Not sure where I saw it (I think IGN) but Forza 6 will be shipping with Porsche! This fact alone is making me buy Forza 6
forza,396plr,deegood,3,Tue Jun 9 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"All the wording is kind of conspicuous.. Their press release says that Porsche will be added to FM6. It kind of makes me think that they could be confirming a DLC. But that seems like a very strange thing to announce. Which now that I think about it, kind of make sense for the wording.. If they want to hype people up but dont want to outright claim its a DLC, they could say ""will be added"" and get away with it.  I obviously hope thats not the case and its just poor wording but those are my thoughts"
forza,396plr,mjike,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"Struck me the wording was a bit vague as well, so I'm keeping expectations realistic for now. One way or another they'll make it to FM6 though, and that's awesome."
forza,396plr,HakonJ,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:14:10 2015 UTC,"When a company buys a license from another company, they decide on a length of time the license will be valid. Maybe EA gave them a license that lasts long enough to make an expansion for FM4, Horizon 2, and FM6?  But then again, if that were the case, FM5 would have Porsches..."
forza,396plr,hotbuilder,2,Wed Jun 10 01:19:55 2015 UTC,"When they accidentally mislabled the Duracell pack as the Porsche Expansion on Youtube, I searched for an article from last year discussing the FM4/Porsche deal. It sorta hit on the FM5/Porsche topic but I couldn't find it. From what I remember reading T10 only had it long enough to do the expansion for FM4. Technically EA can dictate the license however they choose, it could be a length of time(which is the typical way because of legalities for providing post release software support) or it could have stipulations of X number of cars for X number of games."

The Forza Horizon 2 Porsche Expansion is the result of an agreement between Porsche, EA, and Xbox to bring the Porsche experience to all Xbox One players.

forza,3915vg,RapidKiller1392,2,Mon Jun 8 14:53:29 2015 UTC,"Whoa. So what I'm getting from this is that on top of Horizon 2 getting it as DLC and FM6 having it at launch, now any game on Xbox One can now include Porsche.   This is huge, if that's exactly what this means! But, it makes sense. T10, or any studio for that matter, probably couldn't hold a candle to EA's demands anymore, so this had to be done on a console-wide scale. I feel for PS4 owners (and the devs for multi-platform games), but I wouldn't be surprised to see PlayStation follow suit. Porsche probably realized they made a huge mistake going exclusive with EA.   It's about damn time!"
forza,3915vg,VinDoctor21,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:56:17 2015 UTC,Actually they still had to go through EA to get this deal done. Sorry man but EA are still douches with Porsche but at least they were able to work this deal out.
forza,3915vg,deegood,2,Mon Jun 8 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally agree. Fuck EA. I'm just speculating here, but it's always been about screwing as many people over to make more in the long term for EA. We can't tell where Porsche stands here, but they must be feeling some sort of regret if they went ahead and agreed to Xbox as a whole to use their brand.   Unless this is an entirely different arrangement. Xbox might have just taken EA out of the picture by paying them off, leaving the individual studios to deal directly with Porsche. Or this was an exclusive deal for Forza that was negotiated by Xbox. But the wording    to bring the Porsche experience to all Xbox One players   is pretty optimistic.  All I know is that I'm happy with this at the very least, but I hope this is just the start!"
forza,3915vg,RapidKiller1392,3,Mon Jun 8 17:04:28 2015 UTC,"This is what I mean though, that word 'adding' is a bit ambiguous. Could see that meaning paid DLC, in game at launch, or both."

forza,38n3s8,somekid150,3,Fri Jun 5 15:44:29 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/EqIEc9n  Similar photo on XB1. (ignore the tire marks)
forza,38n3s8,SpinningAndWinning,5,Sun Jun 7 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"Straight off the bat you'll see that the 360 version is extremely gimped compared to the X1. This particular photo, while very good, is an unfortunately poor photo compared to an equivalent X1 photo."
forza,38n3s8,Nuclearbananas,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:52:45 2015 UTC,"Why even compare the two? Are people out there really wondering how poorly a PS1 visually compares to a PS2? Or SNES vs N64? We all know the subsequent systems are more powerful.  Just play your game, regardless of console it's on."
forza,38p9tw,thatguycarrig,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:26:54 2015 UTC,Xb1 or 360
forza,38p9tw,Cartime,2,Fri Jun 5 18:57:51 2015 UTC,"sorry, forgot to mention. Xb1"
forza,38mfwc,Clean-one,12,Fri Jun 5 04:03:27 2015 UTC,"Decent* Forza 5 is pretty incredible in terms on car and road textures, not much else."
forza,38mfwc,DabScience,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:51:14 2015 UTC,It still looks incredible if you have a good picture.
forza,38mfwc,Eggnogin,0,Fri Jun 5 15:44:21 2015 UTC,"Eh, that road looks weird in that shot, but in motion, so many 360 games look really good, they just aren't running 1080p or running 30fps in a lot of cases. Forza games look really plastic-y compared to the Horizon games."
forza,38mfwc,NtheLegend,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:07:58 2015 UTC,XBO can't even run some games at 30fps
forza,38ife4,xcgarwil,2,Thu Jun 4 12:45:29 2015 UTC,"Looks great! I had to check the sub, front page and couldn't tell if it was real or not.  :P"
forza,38ife4,ichabod13,2,Thu Jun 4 16:44:04 2015 UTC,Beautiful photo!
forza,38ife4,Jaehon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:35:52 2015 UTC,At first glance on the thumbnail I thought it was an isetta. Does fh2 have any old microcars like that?
forza,38ife4,m4050m3,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:09:05 2015 UTC,Unfortunately no. I love the Isetta.

forza,38ife4,TheCrudMan,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:04:46 2015 UTC,Probably the best color for that car.

forza,38lnj3,pieguy221,3,Fri Jun 5 00:45:59 2015 UTC,"This is also true with Chrysler, Peugeot and Citroen. The latter of the two are very interesting omissions considering the game is set in Southern Europe, with a Rally Based Expansion, and there's no Peugeot 205 T16 or Citroen DS12, cars that fit the environment perfectly!"
forza,38lnj3,willbsn13,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:57:34 2015 UTC,Pretty regrettable I must say ): I'm adorinf everything about Forza Horizon 2 except the omissions of some fan favorite vehicles.
forza,38lnj3,xz-,2,Fri Jun 5 05:20:17 2015 UTC,"they just don't have them and I'm not sure why. I'm honestly still waiting for a 350z, as it's one of the most popular nissan cars that's still not included in the game. I realize they have a 370z but still."
forza,38lnj3,korko,0,Sat Jun 6 18:00:28 2015 UTC,It's not a license problem as they have Nissans and Infiniti is just a Nissan with leather. Probably just not a car in their line up they felt worth the time. I have atleast a hundred hours into FH2 and honestly never noticed the lack of infinitis.
forza,38lnj3,DiamondsWithaZ,2,Fri Jun 5 07:35:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a little bit of an Infiniti fanboy to be completely honest, bit unfortunate for me but I can understand if I'm the minority"
forza,38lnj3,theoneyouenvy,-3,Fri Jun 5 14:49:43 2015 UTC,there is definitely an infiniti.  http://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/games/fh/cars/infiniti
forza,38lnj3,theoneyouenvy,4,Fri Jun 5 01:08:16 2015 UTC,That FH1 not FH2
