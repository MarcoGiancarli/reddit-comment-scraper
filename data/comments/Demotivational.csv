I've watched the play, the modern movie, and the original movie, so my only information comes from those.  I actually have the phantom soundtrack (the old one) on my phone, in my car, and on my computer and listen to it regularly, so I know this shit pretty well.  The phantom straight up says he's messing with her to trick her into obeying him, and Christine admits that he's cast a spell and she doesn't know if she can leave.  That's basically straight from a domestic abuse pamphlet.  These are the supporting lines:   1 From the song Angel of Music:   MEG: Where in the world have you been hiding? Really, you were perfect, I only wish I knew your secret, Who is your great tutor?  CHRISTINE: Father once spoke of an Angel, I used to dream he'd appear, Now as I sing I can sense him, And I know he's here, Here in this room, he calls me softly, Somewhere inside, hiding, Somehow I know he's always with me, He the unseen genius   2 In the main theme, these are some lyrics:   CHRISTINE  In sleep he sang to me, In dreams he came, That voice which calls to me and speaks my name, And do I dream again for now I find, The Phantom of the Opera is there, Inside my mind  PHANTOM Sing once again with me, Our strange duet, My power over you grows stronger yet, And though you turn from me to glance behind, The Phantom of the Opera is there, Inside your mind.   3 Later when she's in the cemetery visiting her fathers grave:   CHRISTINE: Twisted every way, what answer can I give?  Am I to risk my life to win the chance to live?  Can I betray the man who once inspired my voice?  Do I become his prey?  Do I have any choice?  He kills without a thought  He murders all that's good  I know I can't refuse  And yet, I wish I could  Oh God, if I agree, what horrors wait for me  In this, the Phantom's opera...   RAOUL: No! Christine, wait!   CHRISTINE: Raoul!   RAOUL: Whatever you believe, this man - this thing - is not your father!"

Demotivational,2ndl4s,HEROnymousBot,43,Tue Nov 25 16:00:15 2014 UTC,See this scene:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hEtN0-vF90  I obviously don't agree with the comment that it's exclusive to race - I just think it applies to people and riots in general. The first part of Ed Norton's speech.
Demotivational,2ndl4s,SunflowerSamurai_,70,Tue Nov 25 17:10:12 2014 UTC,"Clearly you don't understand it at all. Norton's character makes many valid points during the discussion - this is intentional to show the allure of racism and how people end up being drawn into it. But he also completely ignores the fact that there was no evidence of King attacking the officers, the police officers beat him like 50 additional times after he was already on the ground, and when Murray pokes holes in his argument he just resorts to emotional hypothetical bullshit like ""what if Danny was walking on the street and King ran over him?"" which clearly upsets his mother, who doesn't want to think about things like that, and doesn't appreciate having her love of her son used as ammo against her in a political argument. He's being a manipulative, smooth-talking con man, which is exactly what Cameron bred him to be.  Eventually he runs out of rational arguments and he just loses control and resorts to violence to get his point across, because the truth is he doesn't really care about the issue they are discussing; he's just a fucking racist bully who hates blacks and jews and can't stand that his mom is dating a jew. At first the audience are kind of on Derek's side and agreeing with him, but then he gets mad and turns into this abusive monster. He grabs his sister by the hair and shoves food down her throat, and shoves his mom and his brother out of the way when they try to stop him. Now his family is crying and terrified of him, but instead of realizing ""wow, I'm an asshole, that wasn't okay at all,"" he just blames this poor, mild-mannered dude who did nothing and calls him a kike and accuses him of ""poisoning his family's dinner"" with his ""jewish nigger-loving hippie bullshit"" when in fact, Derek is the one poisoning his family - particularly his younger brother, who idolizes him. Derek can't stand to be faced with the consequences of his behavior and what it's doing to his family, which is why he doesn't want them to visit when he's in jail.  Derek changes his ways in prison in one specific pivotal scene, where he is in the infirmary after being raped and beaten. He's at rock bottom, robbed of all of his power, reduced to nothing, his fellow aryan brothers are frauds who betrayed him, and everything he ever believed in has turned out to be bullshit. Sweeney asks him ""has anything you've done made your life better?"" and he breaks down crying and says no, realizing that all that hate and anger did nothing but destroy his life and destroy the lives of his family. He finally reaches maturity - he stops blaming the world for everything, and starts holding himself accountable. He sees his brother going down the same path of destruction, he sees his mother literally sick and dying because of all the pain and stress he caused her, and he realizes he was being a selfish asshole and that he wasn't there when his family needed him. He stops being an angry little immature shit and starts being a man, taking responsibility.  And at the end of the movie, when Danny is killed by the black kid (who is the younger brother of the guy Derek stomped into the curb, an important fact that probably should have been made more clear in the film), Derek doesn't go back to his old ways; when he is cradling his brother's dead body, he keeps saying ""what did I do?"" over and over; he's not looking for people to blame, like he always did - it won't do any good this time. It's right there in front of his face. He knows deep down that his little brother's death was indirectly caused by him and the decisions he made in life, and that nothing will ever bring him back. Even though he tried to make things right at the end, it was too little too late. All the shit he did before seeing the error of his ways didn't just magically vanish; there were inevitable repercussions for it and he winds up paying the ultimate price by losing his little brother.  It's a tragedy for many reasons, but most of all is the fact that both Derek and Danny are shown to be very bright, very gifted young men and they probably could have accomplished great things if they hadn't dedicated their lives to being pissed off. Life's too short to be pissed off all the time."

Law is primarily an agreement between all civil people to restrain ourselves with the understanding that the rising tide of productivity due to our civility lifts all boats. Whatever actors aren't getting their due from this agreement are honestly best served by finding ways to leave the law behind.

Demotivational,2ndl4s,thracc,1 point,Tue Nov 25 20:45:57 2014 UTC,"I would actually agree with you. It is about socio-economic conditions. The problem is that the protesters - some of whom I watched leave from the courthouse, run down Florissant, and begin smashing up shops - and the salivating media (at times, there were more press than protesters) frame it in terms of race. That's the issue. They made it a race issue, and then when it turned out there was ZERO evidence suggesting Wilson deviated from his training, they were too committed - and the issue was too intertwined with race - to allow them to backpedal.  I will, however, disagree that Ukraine is driven by class, whatsoever. There were poor in the Maidan and there are poor in Donetsk. There are rich and powerful men on both sides.  Further, I don't see any rational basis to compare the economic conditions in the Middle East dictatorships to the United States. In the Mid East, there are university-educated people forced to sell vegetables. Worse, there is no welfare or unemployment safety net, and the police and government literally extort average people for the right to operate legal businesses. It really is a COMPLETELY different kind of poor. In the US, our poor have cell phones and Yeezy shoes. There, they are lucky to afford food."

Especially when that cause is ""being angry that a criminal that attempted to disarm a police officer was shot"" just because the criminal was black and the police officer was white.   Edit: Had the opportunity to watch a live stream of the protests last night, where a horde of angry protesters chanted ""Fuck the Police"" over and over as the crowd grew increasingly hostile and violent and failed to disperse. Then they set a Walgreens on fire and looted a poor man's gas station. This was never about a discussion. Not even with the protests.

And if a group of lawyers and judges think there is cause - then court is where he should be. Then guilt can be determined and justice seen to be done.  Frankly, when you look at the dumb story of the cops, it really is incredible that the trial date hasn't already been set. It really shows up how broken the US legal system is that it can't even get this right.  If it were two black men, one of whom shot dead the other unarmed one and came up with an incredible story - you KNOW there would be no debate about it.

From what I understand about Pakistan, Germany and US's healthcare systems, they are no 100% funded by the taxpayer nor run by the state, so you cannot really compare them with the NHS.  As for getting moved off waiting lists, I would suggest you stay in one area until your treatment has been completed, ask to have it moved to your new area before moving, or pay to go private."

Fair point.  The Pakistani healthcare system is so cheap that, as a Westerner, you can probably pay for (decent, mind) surgery from your wage. For poor people (again, this mostly applies to cities) there are organisations like the Edhi Foundation which run hospitals and it's surprisingly effective.  German healthcare is almost state run, in that the fees of public healthcare are state-regulated and unless you have equivalent or better private health insurance, it gets deducted from wages with your tax; it's just co-managed by a private company. It works very well. When my mother had a life-threatening condition acutely, everything went flawlessly and without having to wait. For chronic conditions, there's the same level of service.  Anyway, I hope your family members are fully recovered."

Demotivational,2c8uvt,kevinpilgrim,-1,Sun Aug 31 16:00:03 2014 UTC,"As a person in wealth management in Canada this is completely untrue. Canadians have to spend a lot more than what the average citizen believes. No where near as much as the States but a significant amount of money still needs to be spent personally on health care.  For instance in Canada, a family that has a child whom has cancer the family loses an average of $18,000 in the first 3 months due to travel, pills, accommodations, lack of working etc. If the government can't take care of a sick child without you spending that much then what chance do us grown ups have?"
Demotivational,2c8uvt,Nekrosis13,6,Thu Jul 31 20:14:11 2014 UTC,"Funny, I've never paid a penny for healthcare and I've been living in Canada for 31 years, and I've been hospitalized several times. I'm the average citizen and no one I've ever known has ever spent any money directly for any treatment.   Spent a week in the hospital and got 3 surgeries to fix my arm after an accident. Total cost: $0.   Spent another week in the hospital when I had meningitis. Was on antibiotics and painkillers the entire time. Total cost: $0.   Before you argue that ""nothing is free"", allow me to remind you that we don't spend an average of $2800 per year per citizen on our military. That frees up a lot of taxpayer dollars to be used for education and healthcare. In reality, we make more money and don't pay much more in taxes than most Americans, and our healthcare is covered.   The only thing we spend money on is medication or private/elective care or tests, and those are optional, while medication is typically covered between 80-100% by employer insurance, which costs less than $100 a month for most people, often less than $50, and covers things such as massage therapy, psychologists, naturopaths, acupuncture, even breast implants.   What a family loses on transportation costs and lack of working are not applicable as ""healthcare costs"". They are expenses related to illness or invalidity, and that's a completely different thing. Also worth noting is that in most of Canada, work insurance covers time missed from work if related to illness or injury, so that point is also invalid."

The hotels, travel expenses etc. They can really hurt you. Now don't get me wrong I don't expect the government to pay for that but to say simply that being Canadian negates fee's etc isn't true. And as you said there are things that we don't have to pay for although if you look at the stats depending on where you are in Canada you can have anywhere from 8 to 32 of the approved cancer drugs paid for by the government. It depends on where you are and what is needed.  I am glad that you have had great help from our healthcare system and I have great experiences with them as well, especially my grandmother.

It is men that are given a hard time in divorce court.  Nothing against faithful, hard-working wives! (They are the Good Ones.)  Sadly though, as you point out, less than half of marriages last. More than half of divorces are started by the wife. Even the majority of hardcore physically violent domestic abuse is committed by women.   Yet still, men are very often... actually continually and consistently, are horribly abused by our overtly sexist court system. Society in general, and Big Government in particular, has absolutely nothing against taking half his shit, for the rest of his life, for a family he is no longer part of. All this, simply because a woman has gotten hers and does not want him anymore.   It is a tragedy and a travesty, in this modern day and age of ""equality"", that such blatant sexist bias and discrimination, nay OPPRESSION, is committed by our very government. Feminists, this needs attention!  I wholeheartedly discourage any man from going into marriage unless they strongly desire children. Under no circumstances even move in with a girl that already already has kids, unless you want to be responsible for those kids the rest of your life! The only way to win this game is not to play.  If you feel you simply must, make sure your chosen woman has a better situation staying faithful to you than she does elsewhere.

Just from a quick google search...  Men: The Overlooked Victims of Domestic Violence  ""in a conflicting survey taken by the CDC in 2010, it was found that 40% of the victims of severe, physical domestic violence are men.""  The problem here is that when a man reports such things, he's much more likely to be carted off to jail for it than get any help. At best he can hope they'll just laugh at him, or tell him to ""man up"".  Even the ever-dubious Wikipedia seems to have some decent references to the ""gender symmetry"" in domestic violence.   Domestic violence against men  I hang out with a lot of psychiatrists and therapists too, and the ones that deal with these things have very sad stories to tell...  It is so easy for women to exaggerate, or downright lie... but when the therapist starts insisting that the police get involved, and bring up the dangers of reporting false accusations, in the majority of cases the story changes and the woman admits the fight was mutual, or actually instigated by them, not the man.  Of course, that is not proof, only the experience of a few professionals in the field, and only my word for it.  I'm not asking you to believe on that basis, just saying that's where I first really heard about the problem.

Demotivational,26arkk,preciousjewel128,44,Sun May 25 17:52:48 2014 UTC,"I had a boss who would have me hand type letters and address stickers for all the new hires in the field. To the tune of like 3-500 a month and upwards of 1000 every quarter (when we sent out a 2nd letter regarding another employment stuffs). The task took anywhere from 3-4 weeks of spare time since we ran payroll 4 days a week. I had the audacity to ask if there was any way to export the data into a spreadsheet to mail merge. She shot that down, because she had tried and it didn't work. She refused to hear any of this techie crap and didn't want to hear me bring it up again. When she quit, I turned to my coworker and said, there has to be a better way. She showed me the file to extract the data from the system. I was able to put it into a spreadsheet and run a mail merge. Now the same task of manually typing all that info and the possibility of mistyping (and not catching said error) took weeks. I went and showed my new manager what I had done, it took literally 30 minutes and most of that was printing, no errors unless the system was wrong and the bulk of the work was down to 2-3 hours spent stuffing envelopes which could be sent to the least tech savvy person.

Demotivational,26arkk,everyonelikesnoodles,19,Fri May 23 14:56:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I tried actually. I was really pretty open and friendly about the whole thing. The changes were pretty minor anyway... things like giving technicians a few more mapped drives for convenience, and things like that. They were applications that he wouldn't have known would be helpful for us because he doesn't do what we do, so I approached him with ""hey it would be really helpful to us if... and I actually did the coding to get it all working""  There have been other times I've been ignored too. When we get in trial hardware to evaluate, they always ask our opinion, and regardless of what we say, they do whatever they wanted to do in the first place.  We tested some HP all-in-one printer/fax/scanner machines to use in the offices. The model they got in was a light duty machine for small home offices. Everything was plastic. We told them it was junk, and that they'd be breaking down in months, but they ordered them anyway. And sure enough, within a few months they were dropping like flies.  Unfortunately there's no repercussions for bad decisions like that. We had probably 8-10 people tell management not to buy them, and they did anyway.  I could go on for hours ranting about some of the stupid shit management does.  But you seem like a reasonable person. Are you hiring? :)"
Demotivational,26arkk,BronDearg,6,Fri May 23 15:56:25 2014 UTC,"Haha. Sorry, but we're in the middle of a reorg right now. On any other day though I'd be asking what your skill level was with Active Directory, or what your networking background was..  So, just some constructive feedback here; take it for what you will. First of all, don't be discouraged. You're going to come across shitty folks in teams from time to time. Try to avoid them, they're often cancerous to any positive team culture that may exist. You can often see people like this, negative, unwilling to cooperate, unwilling to collaborate or work together as a team. Sooner or later these people FAIL in team environments and when they do, they take their buddies down with them.  Second, regarding them asking your opinion - I know it might seem like no matter what you say, they're going to do what they want. Unfortunately that's how things will go in a process where someone else is making the decisions. In that process, they're the ""editor"", so to speak and you're simply a resource that they're soliciting for information. You're also likely not the only resource they're seeking feedback from. The GOOD news about it is that these folks are actually asking your opinion. And trust me, people won't go out of their way to ask you, if they didn't care what you had to say.  It's entirely possible that in the end, due to budgeting or some other constraint, they were forced to make the decision to go with those particular models. What you're not seeing right now is those same guys who made those decisions to go with those all-in-ones are possibly standing on the carpet in front of their bosses going, ""See? We asked the guys in the trenches what they thought and they were SPOT ON about it. That Digimule fella said as much, when we asked him.""   Or, more subtly - If you're seeing a high rate of failure and downtime, that's being noticed by the people who paid for them, trust me. That's a cost that's going to figure into the bottom line in the end. Companies make IT purchasing decisions that must be tracked in long-term ways with depreciation and maintenance costs in mind. If these things are falling apart within a few months, people can't print, they can't scan, etc.. It's either in the process of being noticed, or will be noticed soon, somewhere. Monetarily.   Finally, going back to the drive-mapping script - There's always another option. You could use your chain of command and talk to whomever is above the guy that's brushing you off. That comes with a who other set of potential issues though. You could take it to him. Or, take it to your supervisor to see what advice he or she has for you. If nothing else and you have absolutely, positively no recourse then you should write it down as something to bring up during your annual review that you came up, demonstrating ingenuity and taking the initiative. Just because they didn't implement it, doesn't mean you have to lose the credit for thinking outside the box and taking active steps to improve things.  Either way, good luck! Hang in there, you'll eventually find the right team, be it at your current job (maybe doesn't sound like it), or at your next one. Stay positive and upbeat!"

Gravitational force varies based on your position in the universe obviously and trying to take my point that direction is just foolish.

It's like, why don't we just give medals to those on top/in the air, after all, they're on top, so they must be the ones doing all the hard work, right?   Being the top dog in this kind of pyramid is NOT hard work, it's balance. Just balance, nothing else. A rodeo clown has enough balance to take your place in the pyramid on a moment's notice.

It's a tough question: in WWII the Allies turned Dresden into dust and vaporized the non-military targets of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If the Axis had done that, it would be considered a war crime--but we won, so they let that go. Was Gitmo a mistake? Absolutely. Is the military-industrial complex out of control? Absolutely. But in cases where you are seeing horrific things happen to your buddies--it's harder to judge. Pissing on a corpse gets you in trouble; the other side is merrily setting IEDs everywhere.

Demotivational,1zqgky,mashedpotatoes51,16,Fri Mar 7 07:02:22 2014 UTC,"I would argue there's a lot of truth to that, especially if we're talking about US prisons.  There's a concept called ""the school to prison pipeline"" which describes the process whereby kids are virtually funneled into prisons: The mere circumstances of one's birth make it much more likely for some individuals to be labeled as deviant and criminal very early in life, and it's a very hard label to shake. For example, when teachers take one look at you and assume that because of your parents or your siblings or just the color of your skin that nothing good can possibly come of you, that often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. This pipeline is just one demonstration of the consequences for individuals caught up in the system and for society as a whole when we fail to help.  We've seen time and time again that where resources have been provided to marginalized children and their families at an early age, we see tremendous success. I think the best demonstration of this is the Harlem Children's Zone in New York. Parents get help even before their kids are born, and in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the entire US, children thrive.  It's possible to achieve those kinds of results in other places through government initiatives rather than relying on private funding, and these programs would more than pay for themselves in the long run, but attitudes such as yours and those of others in this thread prevent social justice from being a viable political platform, and so political figures don't even bother. It's very depressing. Anyone who's ever met a kid with a ton of potential but the deck stacked against him knows what I mean.  Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"
Demotivational,1zqgky,Mrs_Fonebone,1 point,Thu Mar 6 20:55:49 2014 UTC,I don't know the right phrasing for it but there is some kind of a psychological law of what you just described. Basically it says that an individual eventually start to act in the way it is seen and treated by a bigger or more powerful group. It works in small social units as well for example if a father or a mother constantly calls out his or her daughter as a immoral sex addict she will start acting like one at one day allthough she doesn't did it before.

Demotivational,1zqgky,Mrs_Fonebone,0,Thu Mar 13 03:15:46 2014 UTC,"But many have called their children ""worthless,"" ""thug,"" ""punk,"" ""loser,"" etc. Just because parents (or other authority figures) didn't use the words ""serial rapist"" doesn't mean that the child's self-worth and self-image wasn't defined by the definitions that were laid upon them as a child or that it wasn't a factor in adult criminal behavior.  I'm a big believer that people are responsible for their own actions, regardless of what happened to them as a child.

Demotivational,1zqgky,brownox,0,Wed Apr 16 19:25:36 2014 UTC,"The ""School to Prison Pipeline"" is a function of the neighborhood and culture. If nobody in that neighborhood wants this to change, and believes snitches get stitches and just accept it as life that small children are caught in crossfire and being ""macho"" and ""respected"" matters more than life, then you have a criminal culture, just like, say, the Mafia back in the day. You are too vague about ""some individuals to be labeled as deviant and criminal very early in life"" -- some of them are actually murderers. And yet the good kids who want to do better are ridiculed, harassed, beaten and even killed. And yet some do somehow manage to get through the maze and get to daylight. These are complex problems. ""labeling"" is not the problem. Parenting and priorities are critical. You don't even define ""social justice"" -- you want to put limited resources into one place, and let children starve somewhere else? Or maybe just ignore the poor and abused kids who living in the middle of nowhere and never even see a doctor, here in the fine USA? I'm all out of sympathy an sob stories that imply these problems just ""happen"" by some nebulous thing ""society."" Where are the parents? Why are there toxic cultures that are just accepted?

And so on, and so on....There are far too many grievance mongers out there attacking anyone who dares say anything about them.

What's true is that there is no political constituency for being ""soft on crime,"" while there is one for being ""tough"" on it.  No one wants to be the politician who proposed a bill to give a convict a lighter sentence or allows criminals on the streets for fear that this particular criminal will wind up committing a heinous crime and people will blame the politicians who supported the bill that let them walk.  There's a lot of conspiracy nonsense about the ""prison industrial complex,"" but the truth is that people vote for laws and politicians that make them feel safer.  I would agree that legalizing drugs, prostitution and gambling would actually result in fewer crimes and dry up the funding sources for the vast majority of organized crime syndicates. However, imagine yourself as the politician who actually ran on that platform. You'd be laughed off the stage.  The fact is that we have the system that people voted for: there's no conspiracy of prisons to make people want to be tough on people who break the law. That's just what the overwhelming majority of voters want. If you want it to change, then you have to convince politicians that they can be elected and/or re-elected by voting to do it.

Data is not just fluttering around like butterflies you ""collect"" and then look at it. BUT one can certainly argue logically that given the various causes of crime that are known, money makes no difference; rich people commit crimes, some crimes are impulsive, some people have personality disorders etc. Money itself can change none of this--what is meant is something like ""spending it in certain preventative ways.""

NO ONE wants to decrease the prison population if it means putting active and violent criminals back on the streets. So your basic belief on this matter is misguided, at best, and uninformed.   Additionally, you assume the very point you are trying to argue. At that rate, there's literally no point in talking to you.    Rehab would help people get away from committing crimes (using, buying, selling drugs) and become a productive member of society.   This is an assumption, one which may hold fairly true for some people, such as addicts, but it's dumb as shit to think this would apply to drug dealers. There's just no evidence in the world suggesting that people who primarily sell drugs do so as a function of some addiction. People engage in profitable criminal behavior mostly as a result of poverty. Does rehab put money in people's pockets? Just use your brain a little bit ... it's not hard."

But if you have something worth saying, I will never ignore your substance just because you have a shitty attitude.   With respect to criminal behavior, you have two problems: the desire to break a law, and a lacking of incentives not to. At the very least, you have to address one of those components, or both, to some degree if you expect to have an impact on crime-rates. So far, you've offered little to no solutions and little to no understanding of the basic motives. Can we at least agree that crimes are committed for a reason, whatever that reason may be?  And keep in mind, this is not addressing the enforced laws. That's an entirely separate issue.

Besides which we don't need more money for education, we need less focus on test scores, and more focus on how to teach.  We can continue to throw federal money at education but instead what we see from federal money is programs like No Child Left Behind, programs that actually punish schools who can't get good test grades, and thus force schools to teach to a specific test, not knowledge that the children actually need.   What we need for education is a focus on quality of teacher,  we already spend two thousand more than the next highest country, PER child.    And yet our math scores are 10th out of the top 12 countries, and science is 9th.   You can see it from USC here  Money is NOT the answer.   And education won't create the jobs that you are missing in your equation.  In fact there are those who are college educated who turn to the life of crime not because of education, but because of a variety of other factors.

A lot of the money comes from the individual townships--which means that places with lower property values and lower taxes are going to have less in the budget than more wealthy, higher-property-taxes districts. Simply increasing the tax rate isn't going to help when the families in the poorer districts simply can't pay much more.   I agree that, a lot of the time, school funds are misused. (For example, those smart-boards I mentioned were only bought because ""if we didn't use the whole budget this year, we'd lose it next year""). That doesn't mean that every district has enough funding if only they would budget it properly, though.   Perhaps you could say that the distribution of the funds throughout the country is the problem, rather than the lack of funding itself--after all, the average is very high. That being said, the distribution is a product of the system that gathers the funding, and in the end it does lead to the end result of ""we don't have enough money."""

The biggest problem with this attitude is that it assumes you can only ever do one thing, and if you come out of school and it's not an in-demand skill, you're stuck.  This could not be farther from the truth.  I'm living, breathing proof of that.  I graduated with a degree in a particular field, and didn't find a job in it.  After a few months of looking, and needing some income, I took a job working in a Computer City (Tandy Corp's version of CompUSA).  The ad in the newspaper was for sales & customer service.  The store manager took a look at a big, strong, 22 year old guy and decided that the spot for me was in the warehouse loading and unloading trucks.  Every day at work was crap.  Fast forward a month, and 2 store managers.  I got called into his office, where he wanted to know why his sales people had to keep coming in from the sales floor to ask the guy on the loading dock questions about the products being sold.  I told him the story, and the following week, I was on the sales floor.  That month, I was sales rep of the month, having far & away blown out what all the other reps sold.  But, was I content to stay that way?  Not at all.  Within 2 months, I'd landed a job working a helpdesk, taking calls to support MS Office and do password resets.  It was more grunt work, but I'd doubled my income in 2 months ($6/hour -> $25k/year).  8 weeks later, I ended up with an offer to go work at an IT outsource shop.  Nothing flashy, your basic ""body shop"" kind of place.  A couple of years there, working my way up, managed a couple of projects, did some interesting work, and I was making $50k/year.  Another opportunity came along with a startup, so I rolled the dice.  Within a year, I was making $75k, and doing pretty cool work.  Bailed to do my own startup with some friends, we stayed afloat for 2 years, and went bankrupt.  At one point, I was worth probably $50m on paper.  Today, that paper is worth more than the stock. Easy come, easy go. :)  Post-startup implosion, I took a job with a network equipment manufacturer, with a significant upgrade in salary.  Since then, I've done a couple more of those, and am well into six figures.  Did I have a single day of formal training for any job I've held since graduating college?  Nope.  Not a single day.  Do I regret not pursuing the path I hold a degree in?  Not in the slightest.  Work is a means to an end.  That end is being able to provide a comfortable life for my family.  I put in quality work, and that results in me being able to provide in that manner."

The reason I went to a technical school was so I didn't have to take all those filler classes. I took the classes I needed for my degree, and that's all. Saves time and money.

You are the wrongest thing since wrong came to WrongTown.  I have seen innocent Chinese people become spontaneously branded with the letter R in your presence.   The beauty of dip on wings is that the cooling, creamy dip allows for the enjoyment of truly hot wings, it provides a textural and flavor contrast to the heat and grease of the wing.  It creates a coating effect on the mouth and tongue that mitigates the capcaisin in the hot sauce, providing a depth of flavor not available when your mouth is on fire and your eyes are streaming tears of liquid regret down your face because you, sir, are too macho for dip.  You, sir, are so wrong that when you sit on a toilet, the toilet paper immediately switches itself to unroll in the Devil's Direction, and there's no cat in the house to give the glimmer of an excuse as to why it may be thus.  Milk curdles, crops die, cows go dry and sports become interesting in your neighborhood.  Wrong. /s"
Demotivational,1vfaxc,wispman,-10,Fri Jan 17 05:50:43 2014 UTC,"Being a man of many years, I've built up a tolerance to hot sauces.  My first experience with hot sauces was as a wee lad of 12, and the first chinese restaurant that opened in my home town.  I'll never forget it.  I ordered the shredded beef scezuan (SP?) style, hot.  The flavors that came along with the heat were amazing!  A subtle sweet flavor mixed with the heat of god knows what, was all it took for me to follow the path I stumbled on to what is now a regular occurence for me. I was sweating profusely by the second bite. My mouth was on fire and I didn't care.  By the end of the dinner, My mouth was completely numb and burning at the same time.  That sensation didn't subside until much later that evening.  Now, I take hot and spicy whenever I can get it.  I'm a junkie.  While I agree with you that the ranch does add a layer of complexity and flavor that can only be accomplished with a very good ranch, It is only with true dedication to destroying your tastebuds that you appreciate a good hot wing, wet or dry, that will put a sweat on your brow.  TL:DR  You ain't been eat'in hot stuff for long, have you?"

Macs, on the other hand, are meticulously designed and tightly controlled by a company that is obsessed with quality.   Engineers are, in general, practical people with no appreciation for form. They measure the quality of a computer by the speed of it's processor, not the the UI or aesthetics."

Many refuse to recognize or accept it, but the point is there are no real Mr. Spocks; aesthetic heuristics is psychologically fundamental to how people make decisions.  However, there is a choice of if or if not to engage with the details of how those heuristics play out.  To attempt to deny the role of aesthetics really is kind of anti-intellectual.  After all, form and function in design are explicitly linked when the design is considered holistically, and to not consider designs holistically is to be deliberately ignorant, thus anti-intellectual."

PC's have a wider user base so most companies are not going to make software that is incompatible with PC unless they are Apple products. This means companies have to make a second version of their software if they want to have Mac customers.   Pain in the ass when shit doesn't work as intended because I needed to use parts from different companies.   This is true for Mac's as well. In fact there are far more things that are not compatible, it's just that you don't have to look into it as much because you just have to know if it is Mac compatible (and for your Mac OS version) or not.  Honestly, it might be easier for certain things for some people. But in my opinion, not enough or to the degree that justifies paying twice as much for the same hardware."

Demotivational,1ujviv,Amadacius,9,Tue Jan 7 12:20:01 2014 UTC,Exactly. Macs aren't highly customizable if you know what you're doing. Mac OS is a unix derivative. Apple basically took an open source operating system and put tons of restrictions on it and made it incompatible with everything. Simple tasks on PC are made very complicated on Macs. They are incompatible with most existing software and it's hard to make software for macs. Many of the free open source programs that exist for windows and linux are either expensive or non existent on macs.
Demotivational,1ujviv,ThanostheMadTitan,3,Mon Jan 6 23:03:28 2014 UTC,"I don't think OSX has any ""restrictions"".  I think the mistake you might be making here is thinking about iOS instead of OSX; iOS is a ""walled-garden"" restrictive closed source OS.  But OSX is a POSIX OS, meaning it  supports probably the largest set of OS compliance standards currently in existence."
Demotivational,1ujviv,Amadacius,4,Mon Jan 6 23:15:13 2014 UTC,"""put a bunch of restrictions on it""   actually its still as malleable as most unix systems, it's just a different format.   unlike a unix system it is fully supported by apple.   ""made it incompatible with everything""? like.. what? windows software? the fact that apple created this os to be user friendly at an entry level (arguably unlike unix) they had to give and take some things, but its a far stretch from everything.  they are incompatible with existing software because it's an entirely different OS than windows.   like you can't just copy paste your exe files over from a windows pc to a mac and expect it to run..  can you explain some simple tasks on pc that are made ""very complicated"" on macs?   you are grandly stretching the truth here.. and I get it because everyone loves anti-mac circle-hate"

After that I would have to scroll through all the forums complaining about a lack of mac compatible software for the task and the forums claiming that macs are compatible with everything before I would finally get the task done.

Demotivational,1ujviv,ThanostheMadTitan,0,Tue Jan 7 04:49:49 2014 UTC,Completely non-tangent to the thread. The criticisms of windows are pretty much the same as the Mac OS but on a different level. Windows also restricts users abilities and dumbs down the experience. Windows however tends to be a happy medium between apple and linux. The difference with windows is that it's not attached to hardware.
Demotivational,1ujviv,Amadacius,1 point,Tue Jan 7 04:39:30 2014 UTC,"I use Max when I need FLAC playback, but I nearly always use it to convert to a more broadly supported codec. I think I actually googled ""FLAC Mac"" and took the first hit back in 2007 when I switched. It's pretty trivial to make any computer work with consumer formats. Making iTunes play FLAC would be harder, but I don't care about that. ALAC is pretty good, but if I want lossless audio I'm much more likely to rip into WAV/BWAV so that all my audio software understands it. Honestly, though, 320k mp3 is good enough that most venues' sound systems won't have an audible difference from the WAV version, and I can carry a much larger library conveniently. If I don't need to edit it, lossless isn't necessary.   Getting ham radio software for Mac is substantially more difficult, as only a few apps are built for Mac. Most of them are windows based, and most of the rest are built for a specifically compiled kernel of Linux. Stock versions of OSs like Ubuntu can't run them, either, and resolving the dependencies is an incredible pain. I have gone to a lot of forums and methods to get some working apps, but mostly I compiled from sources so the download sizes are quite small."

Really the problem is with software and compatibility. Apple uses a operating system that is a unix derivative but they took it and added all the restrictions to it so that it is far less useful than unix. However, they did make the software such that you can plug it in and use it with no real knowledge on computers. They feel a niche market. The ideal mac user has no computer experience, doesn't do much besides photo editing and internet browsing, and has enough money to blow on a 100% mark up (from competitive retail not cost of production.)"

If you have the knowledge to dual boot you probably don't need the 4 inch buttons that give apple it's draw.
Demotivational,1ujviv,Amadacius,4,Tue Jan 7 03:47:51 2014 UTC,"""Why use the Mac OS at all?""  Dude, first of all, I'm old. My first computer was an Atari 800. My second computer was a Mac SE, which I purchased for the grad school program I was in. I was also using an MS-DOS based PC called the Ibycus at the same time. It was so bare bones, every time you needed to get text, you had to write a little script to send the output to the serial port. I liked both kinds of computer, text and GUI.  Later, I got a job that let me work with both kinds of computers.   I supported Windows starting with 3x and ending with XP/Server at a certain large 'Microcomputer Software' company (hint, hint). When I started I worked with everyday end users and by the time I left, I was working with Fortune 500 and Fortune 100s to resolve their issues (Wal-Mart, Boeing, etc.).  I got tired of dealing with all the Windows stuff. I noticed that I spent more time at home and work, in Windows, dealing with problems than using the OS. I'd sit at my Mac and bam! I was working. Every bit of training I had to write and deliver was produced on the Mac. It's only gotten better since OSX, because it's easy enough for my mom to use, and I can do all kinds of nifty command line stuff. Also, I can install shiteloads of free open source command line and X-Windows apps, and I can boot into Windows 7 if there's a game or some other Windows app I want to run.   My philosophy is basically to tell people to try out both kinds of computers and then decide what they want to do. I make no guarantees either way. I just tell them make a list of what you want to use it for and then decide.   My brother in law wanted to learn about hardware and software and how to program. Told him to get or build a PC. Mom wanted a basic system to do Internet and for the grand kids to do homework on. Told her to get a Mac. Plus, it's easier for me to support her Mac for her. Mostly printer problems  and updates and stuff like that. ;-)"
Demotivational,1ujviv,ksheep,-1,Tue Jan 7 03:55:58 2014 UTC,"You miss quoted me. I asked ""why run mac os at all then?""  The then was the most important part of the question. If you are going to run Windows through Mac then what is the point of getting a mac? Usually people go for the mac because it is simple. It's good for basic level users who don't need to work with a bunch of different programs. If you have the ability and knowledge to use a PC then you are much better off. You say you spent more time dealing with problems than using the OS, but I rarely encounter problems at all. My experience with windows has been ""if there's a will there's a way."" Everything has so far worked as it should with one exception: a touchscreen monitor that I wouldn't even be able to begin to use on a Mac."

No one is saying you must buy a iMac and use $1000 for the screen and have a GPU if you don't need it, you can always get one of those Macminis for about 600 bucks and get your own screen for $100-200 (800 dollars for a basic computer isn't THAT bad BESTBUY HP PC). Plus, you really can't compare building your own PC to Apple, they are a brand like HP/Gateway/Acer and they will mark up it because they can (Like HP/Gateway/Acer).    The real downside of apple for the average person is how few games work on their computers. If you own an apple you have the choice between World of Warcraft and Starcraft.

Like I said, it has a niche market. It's plug and play which is a huge bonus for people. It's just not plug and play DC Universe or <insert fun game here>. However, on the mark up you are sorely mistaken. I remember some youtube host doing the math comparing his computer with a computer with identical specs made by Apple and found that his was $2000 cheaper. http://store.apple.com/us/buy-mac/mac-pro When I compare this computer to my home built, I payed $1200 for a computer that is in every way superior except I don't have a quad core processor. Which I could buy here for far cheaper than the difference in price between my computer and the Mac. I bought all my parts on Amazon (I didn't shop around at all) and still there is a $1200 difference between what I spent and what I would have spent if I went to apple. I can also download a nearly identical but more customizable OS for free. You say that their screens are $1000 but I don't know where you are getting that number because I have a HD 1080p touch screen monitor for my computer for a quarter of that. I could get 1440p 27 inch monitor for half of that. Literally it is a thousand dollar apple sticker.

Demotivational,1ujviv,t0wn,-1,Tue Jan 7 02:07:15 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry about the monitor, I thought you meant cost not price. However, I no longer understand your point. The apple monitor is twice the price of competitive monitors therefor it's not overpriced? Comparing the Iphone 5s and Galaxy S4 is a moot point since the Smart Phone market is an oligopoly. Additionally, the S4 is superior in every way. Addressing the work station vs graphics cards: that would add  $100 to my computers price. between that and the 250 for the better CPU, we still have $1300 to go. That's about enough to make up for their overpriced monitor! And that article you linked is flat out wrong. You can get a cheaper faster processor for a fraction of the price they provided. Buy two of those babies and you are absolutely smoking the apple processor while still saving $1000. The GPU's used in the article aren't even offered on the Apple website and aren't what's included in the price estimate for the apple computer. Additionally the way that the Mac Pro configures those graphics cards will drastically reduce speeds. Also, they quadrupled the price of their SSD because of the type of connection their motherboard uses (which is complete bullshit.) They also marked up the cost of their RAM by $200 from comparable retail. In conclusion I could construct a computer that is even faster than the Mac Pro (maxed stats) for about 6k. That's a savings of 4 thousand dollars. Now that is a lot but there is one thing to remember, I am constructing my computer off of retail-priced parts. Every time I buy a part there is already a massive mark up on it. When Apple buys their parts they buy them whole sale and in bulk. The price they pay for a graphics card is a lot less than the price I would have to pay for a graphics card. This means that if they sold their computer for 4 thousand dollars cheaper, they would still be making a hefty profit. They should be able to sell their computer for less than I can make one and still be profitable but are choosing not to. Also, when you are buying a $10,000 dollar mac pro, you can't hide behind the guise of not having the knowledge to build your own. If you are spending 10 grand on a computer it is probably a corporate computer and you can afford to have your IT guy set it up for you.

With that being said, when Apple changes to a 4K resolution instead of a 2K resolution (still not that bad considering Thunderbolt Display is extremely good) it will still be $1000. The quality of the Thunderbolt Display IPS is still better than any other competitive ones. For $1000 the Thunderbolt Display is actually worth it. And one thing I don't think I mentioned was that these displays retain their values. You paid $1000 for it, I can guarantee that next year it will be worth at least 90% of the original cost. Oh and Thunderbolt is extremely fast. Where you said PCIe is bullshit you are completely wrong. People like you look at only specs even with phones. You are probably one of those people who see that AMD processors have more cores thus are better. It has been proven that Apple CPUs work better in single threaded applications than Androids (Most Applications are single threaded btw) Do some research Maybe if you were gaming that processor may be better, in server situations that CPU is superior. You really cannot compare the two, one is for one thing the other for another. (apples and oranges) PCIe SSDs are more expensive. They are not bullshit, they are know to be faster than 6gb/s SATA, do your research before spewing shit. 2 WorkStation cards I can guarantee are more expensive than yours. Sorry if you don't know how expensive Firepro cards are lol    Amazon has FirePro W7000 cards retailing at 649.USD. Apple is providing essentially two of these or approximately 1,200.USD in GPU value in the baseline Mac Pro.    And by calling them graphics cards is completely wrong. These are Workstation cards, if you tried to play games on max with these they would do you no good, they have the same GPU as some of the consumer based video cards but they will not work the same (prob equal if not less than a 7850). They are essentially addons to help render polygons. Again do your research before spewing shit. Again, you are thinking gaming. Even a IT tech couldn't get a computer like that to play games on Max (impossible). Even if you got the $3000 Mac Pro you wouldn't get it for personal use because again, you are just thinking gaming (you thinking gaming parts are better lol).

I see where you're coming from but my point is that the OS isn't any longer much of a selling point for apple, at least as far as purchasing their hardware is concerned. My macbook boots windows 7 and linux. I have a PC in the corner that runs OSX(though I haven't booted it up in a few months). Installation, on both machines, was just like installing any other OS."
Demotivational,1ujviv,championruby,3,Tue Jan 7 02:46:22 2014 UTC,"But not everyone is about specs either. The mentality of Apple customers is, if it works its good I'll get it. That is why many people including myself have gotten brands like HP/Acer/Gateway/Dell as their first computer but when it wasn't enough to play games they needed a cheaper alternative (compared to alienware as they were one of the first pc gaming companies). Apple hardware isn't anything amazing but it gets the job done. If you are gaming, yeah go build a computer, that's what I did, but if you were like my brother and edits photos a lot why not go for a Mac, their screen is better than a normal LED LCD one and it runs just fine for it's purposes. Remember the Screen itself is worth $1000 so you really are paying about $500-600 for the hardware which is decent.  Back to my gaming point, recently games had gone a complete change  and require a much better video card(compare something like Starcraft to Starcraft 2, or CS 1.6 to CSGO). But there are also other things like video editing or photo editing that are much more CPU intensive and a Mac will run fine. After hearing many rants from anti-Apple people I can conclude that the main reason people will refuse to accept Apple is because of specs. But honestly if you are spending $3000+ on a computer you better know how to use it, most of Apple's high-end stuff is exactly targeted to those people (video/photo editing, servers). NOT and I repeat NOT for gaming.  And when people say Apple is a scam, Macs arn't a scam, Alienware is a scam. Macs were designed to do what they do, they require inferior hardware (they have very decent hardware) to run just as well as a PC (they also have exceptional battery life compared to normal laptops, not ultrabooks). Alienware is a scam because they are platformed to be gaming computers while they give i5s and 640s charging the same price if not more than Apple. Apple costs that much because they feel that is what their product is worth, they can charge people that and they will still buy it. Alienware labels their computers gaming when all they have is a flashy case with inferior hardware that is supposed to be for gaming. Anyone that knows shit knows Alienware is literally a scam."

Science-project guys will hate the cohesive system, saying it's much more closed, and you can fiddle with it as much, changing out parts willy-nilly all the time (as if you'd really swap out parts that often).  Cohesive systems guys will deride the science project for a number of reasons - it's a bunch of random pieces slapped together like a puzzle, they typically run Windows, etc.  Lots of jokes about BSODs, etc.  You can probably guess where I stand on this question. :-)  That said, I've got a couple of science projects of my very own, and they both have their merits.

By the time you get done you'll realize that words aren't truths, but abstract thoughts strung together as a representation of the world, and that any truth that one can gain from them is no more true than a statement like ""jesus walked on water"".

The best scientists are fully aware of this. Science, when it works correctly, is based entirely AROUND the fallibility of man. That is why one must test and retest a hypothesis many times, that conclusion much be peer-reviewed, and the conclusion must stand the test of time.  Regarding the question of what came before the big bang, or even THAT a big bang ever even happened, science doesn't know. The big bang itself is a theory, and that's okay. Saying ""I don't know, but here's my best guess and these are the facts that support it"" is a very honest and honorable thing to admit.  I would sooner argue anyone claiming to have an answer for everything is far less trustworthy than someone willing to admit they know very little about the way things work.  And, if you ask any scientist worth their salt in their field, that is EXACTLY what they'll tell you. The more you learn, the more you realize just how little you know."

So if a girl is good-looking enough for me, intelligent enough, and cool enough, she's perfect. Of course it's completely subjective.  Problem is most girls get 2/3 - smart and hot but she's a bitch. Hot and nice, but she's dumb. Nice and smart, but she's ugly or fat.  Then there's the unfortunate ones that get 1/3 - smart, but bitchy and ugly. Hot, but stupid and bitchy.

For others this means absolutely wreaking it in the mosh pit, or teaching your children how to play sports.

Food and genetics are hands down the biggest factors in determining your health...to suggest otherwise is being willfully ignorant.

Lets look at the leading causes of heart disease shall we?  http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm   Americans at Risk   High blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About half of Americans (49%) have at least one of these three risk factors.7 Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including: Diabetes Overweight and obesity Poor diet Physical inactivity Excessive alcohol use   Protect Your Heart   Lowering you blood pressure and cholesterol will reduce your risk of dying of heart disease. Here are some tips to protect your heart: Follow your doctor’s instructions and stay on your medications. Eat a healthy diet that is low in salt; low in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol; and rich in fresh fruits and vegetables. Take a brisk 10-minute walk, 3 times a day, 5 days a week. Don’t smoke. If you smoke, quit as soon as possible. Visit www.cdc.gov/tobacco and www.smokefree.govExternal Web Site Icon for tips on quitting.   You must be one of those people for whom there are only 2 categories of people   ok...i said enjoy everything in moderation in my last post..I think you're the one looking to force people into categories sweetie. Nowhere did I say plump people couldn't do those things, what I said was    but also be healthy enough to play with your kids, fuck your spouse, travel, not be in constant pain, and not be a burden to your family.   You can be plump and be healthy, no one is denying that. But you sound overly defensive and trying to justify your lifestyle. It's fine if you don't take care of your body, I don't know you, I could care less if you die at 40. But to suggest eating healthy is pointless...I really hope you don't breed and pass that mentality on to children.  But whatever floats your boat."

It appears to me this is about proving to yourself and only to yourself that you are better than me. If that's the case you can have it.   But if you insist:   Let's start with the '='. It could commonly be assumed to be a shorthand for equivalence, which would require ""not happy implies no money"". This is wronged by endless counter examples that I'm willing to give Wald0 the benefit of doubt meaning implication:   (1) [No money implies not happy] is untrue  Let's for the moment assume (1) is true on its own. Attaching any additional constraint, such as   (1') [No money implies not happy on tuesday afternoons] is untrue  If you get picky about the odering, even   (1'') [No money implies not happy] is untrue on tuesday afternoons  would still be true.   The mistake you make is assuming that   [not (a implies b)] implies (a implies b)     In case you are also interested in content:   I simplified horrendously.   What is to the best of my knowledge the best of our current knowledge:    Absence of basic requirements is a very good indicator of unhappiness Money is a common proxy for getting those, but it's not essential in that process After the minimum requirements for not being unhappy are met, money can by you happiness. It's just terrible at it - emtpty-a-bathtub-with-a-spoon terrible The best ROI you get at using money to create good memories   What I tried to say - pardon my inaccurate wording - is:   Money is good and removing fundamental obstacles to happiness.

So yes, even in the elementary level it takes practice. Practice helps keep the information in long term memory.  The fact that the school system has to teach to the lowest common denominator every year, I think, it the bigger issue. You might have a separate class for the smartest and the developmentally disabled, but there's still a wide range of skills in between.   There would still be homework, though.

We homeschool our kids, and they are so far ahead of their contemporaries scholastically, it's ridiculous. At the same time, they rarely spend more than 5 hours a day on schoolwork. That's because we don't waste their time with mountains of homework designed to ensure that the thickest student in the class ""gets it."" Memorization has it's place. But mostly people learn by doing. Not memorization, don't confuse the two ideas.  Doing things means you are making memories, which lock information in your brain. Memorization means burning a pattern into your brain through sheer stubborn repetition, with the hope that you'll use the information in some meaningful way and lock it before it leaks out.  Kids really are dumber in general today than 30 years ago. It's in the eyes, and you can see it if you look. The reason is, they spend 10-12 hours every day getting their heads crammed with stuff they've already learned. All so the dumbest kid in class can ""get it."" Hopefully. Meanwhile, these same kids are spending time on schoolwork that they should be using to make new memories, to experience life. Memories they can relate new ideas to. Because that, being able to relate new information to your existing memories, is how learning works most efficiently. Pardon my French, but F**K memorization. Memorization is for phone numbers, and your favorite poems and prayers--things that are personally important to you. When you need to memorize something like that, the memorization comes easily.

There is no such thing as 'good homework,' as u/jakedrakerider suggests (and this comes from someone currently learning modern educational techniques), and you hit the nail on the head: adults don't always take work home with them (some do, but not all), and college students have to be able to partially teach themselves because collegiate-level professors have more to do than worry whether or not you can do college algebra.  The students that wanted out of math failed because they didn't care about math, not because they didn't do homework. I've gone through school doing homework, but that doesn't mean it was helpful; it was a grade. Teachers are supposed to be able to have time in class that can be used to allow students to practice as master skills. Sending a child home with homework that they might not fully understand hurts them more than anything.  Why do you think teachers have to integrate subjects together these days?

She's just very verbal and not good with numbers. Trust me, she tries really hard. There's just something about how her brain developed that makes doing math very, very difficult.   Also some traumatic brain injuries can prevent a person from doing math. That's called acalculia.

For anything seriously complex they'd model with electrical circuits and view through an oscilloscope (you can model any differential equation from thermo dynamics to suspension systems with resistors, capacitors and inductors). This is pretty much the same as any verification or simulation software  I guess what I'm trying to say is engineers 50 years ago are similar to engineers today.  No better, no worse.

Though a slide rule was used for some of the design and trajectory calculations, the active part of the mission was driven entirely by computers. What makes that impressive is that the computational power of the entire mission was less than half a dozen C64's with the craft itself having the computational power roughly equal to that of a Vic20.  The mission was driven by a bank of IBM 360 computers with another on the module itself.  The idea that the lunar landing was done by a slide rule is a myth. It was only used for the most basic calculations. Everything was driven by the IBM 360."

It implies that the only reason a thin woman would date a fat man is because she's after his money - she's gotta be a golddigging whore who's giving him sex in exchange for it, because there couldn't possibly be another reason she'd ever want to be with him.   It implies that he doesn't deserve her because he's fat and therefore inferior. She's above his station because of her weight.   It implies that he is unlovable because he's fat - she couldn't be with him because she loves him; his fat renders his mind and talents and personality invisible and unnecessary.  It even implies that the only person he should really hope to date is someone who is equally fat...if this was a picture of two fat people holding hands nobody would say anything about how much money he had or how big his manhood probably is or anything at all.   Anyway, I know this is supposed to be humorous, but it's just full of so much prejudice and body shaming that I can't laugh at it. It also doesn't help that my hormones are currently making me seriously emotional. But seriously, this kind of prejudicial crap needs to go away."
Demotivational,1k5m35,tanyax14,2,Mon Aug 12 02:47:09 2013 UTC,"I don't really like the whole every-body-is-equal-PC mentality. In terms of forming and maintaining relationships, an obese person IS inferior to a physically healthy and fit person. I don't know why we have to pretend that's not true and act like people who believe that are horrible. It's just simple biology. You are ranked on your attractiveness, fertility, wealth, ability to provide stability to a family, general genetics and health, etcetc. Obviously each one has different weights depending on whether you're male or female. It's nature - survival of the fittest - sexual selection. But people date others of a similar 'ranking' to each other, it's shown in psychological research. There's no reason to date 'below' yourself and somebody higher than you won't settle for you either, so thus you end up with fairly equivalent matches.  Also I don't think there's anything wrong with being with somebody for their money. It means they can provide for you and give you everything for a stable family. It's no more shallow than liking somebody because they're pretty.   I guess it's just my opinion but I don't think love is just some magical random thing. I think you fall in love with people who are in some way compatible with you (whether it works out in the end is another story), you don't just start with love. You don't have the same chance of falling in love with an extremely obese, poor, ugly person with a terrible personality than you do with somebody who's fit, healthy and successful. I just think all of this overly romanticised stuff is contradictory to our biology. And I'm not some shallow prick because I think so."
Demotivational,1k5m35,gazork_chumble_spuzz,0,Mon Aug 12 17:57:55 2013 UTC,"I don't really like the whole every-body-is-equal-PC mentality.   I don't believe that every body is equal...some are healthy and others are not. It's a fact of life. What I do take issue with is judging a person's character by nothing more than their weight. It's disgusting.   In terms of forming and maintaining relationships, an obese person IS inferior to a physically healthy and fit person.   That is bullshit. Your ability to form and maintain a healthy relationship has less than nothing to do with what you look like or how much you weigh. It has everything to do with your maturity as a person, whether you are good at communicating/compromising/understanding the other person or whether you're a selfish douche who wants everything to go your way. Being healthy or fit doesn't make you ""better"" and it doesn't make you a better partner automatically, either. That's just stupid. It isn't ""simple biology"" - it isn't even true.   You are ranked on your attractiveness, fertility, wealth, ability to provide stability to a family, general genetics and health,   Only by shallow people. Things like your character, your mind, your habits, your personality - those are the things that matter the most when you are determining whether someone would be a good match for you. Attractiveness is what initially catches your eye, of course, because until you have spent time with the person you don't know anything about them whatsoever, and all you've got is their appearance. But once you get to know them as a person, attractiveness and wealth should matter less than who they are. You aren't marrying a wallet or a body, but a person...if the things that matter most are surface things like their weight or how pretty they are, then your choice is at best shallow and at worst, shortsighted because they're one day going to get old and wrinkly and sick, and if your relationship is built on their youthful health and beauty than it is doomed to fail.   Also I don't think there's anything wrong with being with somebody for their money. It means they can provide for you and give you everything for a stable family.   What about love? A family built on money isn't going to be a happy or healthy family. If all you care about is their food and clothes and giving them a big house and all the dance/soccer/piano lessons you can cram into a week, you've missed the mark entirely. Having material stuff is important, granted, but it's not as important as being with someone who loves you wholeheartedly and who will love the kids just as much, who will be a devoted parent who cares about more than just feeding and clothing the children. Money is only a little part of what it takes to have a happy, stable home life - you can have that even if you're poor. Kids need more from their parents than that. They need time, attention, love, someone who will listen to their problems and actually care, someone who will take the time to lovingly discipline them and give them guidance as they grow into adults. Money can't buy that. Lack of money doesn't keep that from happening, either. And all the material possessions in the world won't make up for lacking that kind of relationship during your childhood.  Being with someone for their money is not a relationship. You're using them.    I guess it's just my opinion but I don't think love is just some magical random thing.   Neither do I. I love my husband to the moon and back, and I truly don't think I would ever have felt this way about any of the guys I knew back in the day, had I gone out with them instead. He's perfect for me, and me for him.   I think you fall in love with people who are in some way compatible with you (whether it works out in the end is another story), you don't just start with love.   Of course. I didn't say otherwise!   You don't have the same chance of falling in love with an extremely obese, poor, ugly person with a terrible personality than you do with somebody who's fit, healthy and successful.   Obviously not. But those aren't the only two choices out there. You'd probably have a better chance falling in love with a person who was fat but handsome and charming and fun than you would with someone who was fit and healthy but ugly and a jerk. Those two men you described (I'm going with men since I'm a hetero woman) aren't the only two choices we get to pick from. Many fit, healthy people aren't successful, or attractive, and some of them are total douchecanoes. Many obese people are successful, or attractive, or have amazing personalities. Life isn't black and white. You see it as fat people = not so great, thin people = probably awesome, and that isn't how life works. That isn't how people work. You want to shove people into narrow little pigeon holes according to their weight, but reality doesn't back you up here. The world is full of fat people who have successful businesses, happy marriages, and stable, loving families; and the world is full of thin people who are poor, whose relationships fail, whose personalities suck, and who are all-around lousy people. You can't judge a book by its cover. You can't look at a fat person and know that they are inferior to the thin person standing just beside them. You don't know anything about the fat person other than the fact that they're fat, and you also don't know anything about the thin person either.    I just think all of this overly romanticised stuff is contradictory to our biology.   We don't have to be slaves to our biology anymore. We have the ability to employ ration in a manner that no other animal species on earth can. We are able to think deeply, to be logical, and to control our bodies and our actions in a way that other animals cannot. It's 2013...we've been to the moon, we're going to Mars, we've launched probes deep into the solar system and deep into our genome. We aren't living in caves anymore. We've progressed well beyond that. We no longer need to rely on our biological drives and urges and instincts for our mating choices."
Demotivational,1k5m35,tanyax14,1 point,Mon Aug 12 19:01:29 2013 UTC,"I didn't mean to write in maintaining relationships, obviously. Passive traits like beauty don't have much to do with maintaining relationships naturally (unless it changes~)   Firstly I appreciate you not telling me what I think (it was just an example, I don't think fat people are automatically bad people. Well obviously in terms of relationship material I'm saying they are at a disadvantage). My problem in replying to you is that all of it just seems to be your opinion. The research doesn't really support it. Questionnaires consistently show that men look for fertility and vitality in their mates and women look for success, power and physical strength. This is what people TELL the researchers. Unless you think the thousands of people that participate are all shallow.   I remember the specific study where people cut up pictures of current couples and gave them to participants to rate. They found that when they put the pictures back together, the couples almost always got a very similar attractiveness rating. = People look for similar physical attractiveness to themselves when picking a mate.   There are literally hundreds of these studies. Yes, this is mainly about initiating relationships, not maintaining them afterwards, but obviously you can't maintain relationships with people you haven't initiated with yet.   We basically add up people's traits for our opinion of them. But it's a weighted process so for example if I want an intelligent man but not a serious man it might be 5 x (his intelligence) + -5 x (his seriousness) = my opinion towards him. Obviously there are many more traits to factor in, but it's an example (before you jump to saying OMG YOU HATE SERIOUS PEOPLE...) But yes a fat person is generally valued lower by everyone except BBW lovers or people in specific culture, and then they have to make up that difference. Now you seem to just be saying that weight is of low importance and other factors are of higher importance but that is simply your own opinion. Many other people value things you consider shallow such as physical appearance - and just because YOUR relationship works well with what you value does not mean that other people cannot base relationships on traits you disapprove of."
Demotivational,1k5m35,gazork_chumble_spuzz,1 point,Mon Aug 12 20:19:17 2013 UTC,"Firstly I appreciate you not telling me what I think (it was just an example, I don't think fat people are automatically bad people.    No, you just think they are inferior and that they aren't good relationship material. Replace the words ""fat people"" with the word ""Jews"" or ""gays"" and you'll get an idea of how your sentiment comes across. It's the same kind of prejudice.   Well obviously in terms of relationship material I'm saying they are at a disadvantage).    The only disadvantage they have is that our society has a stick up its collective butt about body image - thin is all-important, and fat means you are a human target for prejudice and hate and shaming, even from strangers. But they are just as capable at being a devoted, loving, compassionate, intelligent, fun partner as a thin, fit person.    My problem in replying to you is that all of it just seems to be your opinion.    And almost everything you've posted has been just your opinion.    The research doesn't really support it.   What about reality? What about the fact that every place I've ever lived has been full of people, both thin and fat, who have happy relationships, and other people, both thin and fat, who are lonely? There are so many couples who are not ""equal"" when it comes to their physical appearance, and yet they are happy and they stay together.    Questionnaires consistently show that men look for fertility and vitality in their mates and women look for success, power and physical strength.    ""Thin"" isn't always something that people equate with fertility and vitality, or with success, power, and strength. Sometimes you find everything you want residing in the body of an overweight person.   People look for similar physical attractiveness to themselves when picking a mate.   The fact that there are so many couples with differing levels of attractiveness - hot guy plain girl, hot girl plain guy - is ample evidence that there is no one standard of attractiveness. What you find attractive and what another man finds attractive can be vastly different. So while on some level it's possible that the person thinks their spouse is of the ""same level"" of attractiveness, an outside observer may not agree. Same goes with the whole ""power strength success"" criteria - what one woman finds to be an indicator of physical strength may not be what another woman does.   Now you seem to just be saying that weight is of low importance and other factors are of higher importance but that is simply your own opinion.   I think you misunderstand me. I am not talking about physical attraction. You can be attracted to whatever, and it isn't something that other people can or should judge you for. You can't help what you find attractive. I'm not generally very attracted to overweight men. What I have been talking about, and objecting to, goes beyond mere attraction to actually judging a person's merit by their weight, and that's what you did. You outright said that fat people are inferior when it comes to relationships - that's what I have been objecting to. There is a difference between not being attracted to someone because he or she is fat, and considering them to be beneath you because they are fat. One is acceptable and the other is prejudice. I don't judge you or anyone because of who you find attractive, but I don't agree with prejudice, and saying that fat people aren't good to date because they are inferior at starting and maintaining relationships is prejudice. I don't care if you meant to write it or not - you wrote it, obviously it was what you were thinking at the time, and it's prejudiced to say things like that. THAT is what I take issue with, not merely lacking attraction towards them.   Now you seem to just be saying that weight is of low importance and other factors are of higher importance but that is simply your own opinion.    No. I'm saying that you can't judge a person's character by their weight. I'm saying that their weight is not a factor in having a successful, happy relationship. My mom has been overweight since my older brother was born - my entire life. She and my dad had their 36th anniversary this past March, and they still flirt with one another, still grab each other for hugs and kisses, still have that spark. She is beautiful in our eyes because of her feisty spirit and her kind heart and her keen mind, and she's always had those things - her weight hasn't overshadowed who she is as a person. It hasn't made her have to work harder to make her marriage work or to hold my dad's interest - he's captivated. THAT is what I mean when I say that a person's weight is not important - it doesn't affect their ability to be a good life partner and it doesn't indicate that their character or personality is lacking.    Many other people value things you consider shallow such as physical appearance - and just because YOUR relationship works well with what you value does not mean that other people cannot base relationships on traits you disapprove of.   Basing a relationship on something shallow like physical appearance has been proven, time and again, to be a crappy foundation on which to build a relationship. Looks fade. If you're lucky enough to survive to old age, you're both gonna get wrinkled and grey and saggy, and if the only thing that kept you together was physical attraction it won't last. This isn't an opinion; it's a fact. Relationships based on shallow things like that pretty much never last."
Demotivational,1k5m35,tanyax14,2,Tue Aug 13 00:08:24 2013 UTC,"No, you just think they are inferior and that they aren't good relationship material. Replace the words ""fat people"" with the word ""Jews"" or ""gays"" and you'll get an idea of how your sentiment comes across. It's the same kind of prejudice.   Yes, saying that being healthy is more valuable than being overweight is TOTALLY like being racist or homophobic. I am a self-hating overweight person, because you told me so. Are you crazy :/   The only disadvantage they have is that our society has a stick up its collective butt about body image   No, being overweight is undesirable for many reasons. It generally signifies unhealthiness, prone to illness, poorer fertility, poor genetics, lack of discipline/fitness and many other things. A tiny amount of overweight people being healthy isn't going to change that. I don't see why you're randomly bringing in prejudice from other people into this. What does it have to do with the conversation? Why do you keep bringing it back to ""fat people can be nice people too"" as if I ever said they couldn't be?   And almost everything you've posted has been just your opinion.    Not really. Most of it is either from my relationships module in A Level or my social psych module last year (BSC Psych). Research studies pools of people in order to anaylse reality. Your experiences of the people that happen to live near you does not equate to reality. I don't know why you think your personal experience overrides hundreds of scientific studies. Feel free to read about things like matching hypothesis - research showing that people largely date those of similar attractiveness (and in some that attractiveness is therefore pretty objective) & social exchange theory - the way people evaluate their relationships using cost-benefit anaylsis, as I don't have time to go find all the original sources to the research I talked about.    What about the fact that every place I've ever lived has been full of people, both thin and fat, who have happy relationships   I think you're confusing forming relationships with maintaining them. Yes I made a mistake before by writing 'maintaining' but that was the only reference to them. You PICK a mate based on the 'shallow' things like money and attractiveness. It has nothing to do with how emotionally fulfilled you are. I don't know why you keep telling me I am acting like fat people are automatically stupid or boring or something. I know you seem to be angry that people do this but it's a bit pointless to have a conversation with somebody if you will just keep dragging the point back to something that isn't even being said.   I am saying: Using social exchange theory and matching hypothesis together, people initiate relationships with people that they think are of an equal desirability to themselves. This is a cumulated value of all of their positive and negative traits. So you (unconsciously obviously) add up the values of everything about them - their attractiveness, healthiness, wealth, intelligence, sensitivity, blah blah blah. So yes, obviously, an overweight person can easily have a high value by being funny, intelligent etc. The pretty much one and only point I have been making is that the vast majority of people would rate being overweight as a negative aspect. This aspect obviously has pretty much nothing to do with their other traits and how they are rated, the assumption that I was implying that is simply your's.    I think you misunderstand me. I am not talking about physical attraction.     I think the misunderstanding is mostly because I never said anything regarding overweight people other than their physical attractiveness. Maybe that's why you took it upon yourself to assume that when I say being overweight is undesirable, I meant in every way possible.    I don't care if you meant to write it or not   Aaaaand I don't care if you care. It is a waste of my time to defend myself from whatever you feel like reading between the lines of what I say. Though, the only word I am redacting from what I meant to say was 'maintaining'. Traits like attractiveness are passive - they do not actively effect the maintenance of a relationship unless they change. It's not like you stop valuing somebody's attractiveness long into a relationship, it just isn't a foremost feature anymore. But yes I am still saying that being overweight is a negative trait to have when STARTING relationships (For the reason I said above - if there are two people who are exactly identical besides from their weight, 99% of the time the healthy one would be more desirable). And no, I'm not saying that an overweight person will have a worse, less healthy and fulfilling relationship, simply that in the sexual selection war they are likely to be valued lower. I guess the work 'formation' of a relationship is a little unfortunately because it might make you think of the quality of relationship, but it's just the word we used in school to talk about the factors involved in who people choose to have relationships with. Again: I am not saying that a fat person cannot be more desirable than a thin person if they have other traits. Should I write that after every paragraph or do you get it now...?  I imagine the prejudice comes from the fact that being overweight is very visible. You can tell straight away that somebody has the negative characteristic of high weight whereas it may take time to work out if someone is an asshole. (Though I don't know anybody that insults a fat person by calling them unintelligent or boring or uncaring or whatever. An idiot is bullied for being an idiot because it's a negative characteristic though obviously that happens a lot less because it's not instantly visible). As another disclaimer, as you seem to need these, I am simply describing my opinions on the reasons why this prejudice occurs, I am not encouraging it in any way.   I'm saying that you can't judge a person's character by their weight. I'm saying that their weight is not a factor in having a successful, happy relationship.   Well that's nice. I would argue against this if I thought it was wrong or thought I ever said anything that contradicted this.    Basing a relationship on something shallow like physical appearance has been proven, time and again, to be a crappy foundation on which to build a relationship.   Maybe 'base' was a bad word. I meant more of physical appearance being a large part of somebody's overall desirability (so, rating the value of appearance high in your evaluation of somebody). Obviously people have other traits, it's pretty much impossible to have a relationship with someone who's ONLY good point is their attractiveness because you would hate them. Plus traits like humor, wit, intelligence often contribute to physical attractiveness anyway. I think overall it's a lot easier for a man to base their relationship on attractiveness though (the way that men value attractiveness in a female far more than visa versa is pretty much undisputed), whereas women are more likely to base their relationships on personality traits like humor and intelligence (no this is not true without exception and I am not saying men are shallow because I do not think valuing attractiveness is shallow /disclaimer) Though personally I think old age relationships are more easily maintained by the lack of other options a person has at that point (see the 'comparison of alternatives' section in social exchange theory - basically it states that people are unlikely to seek to end a relationship unless there are high quality, easily available alternatives, even if they are in a poor/abusive relationship). I have to concede that old age relationships work a lot better if people have specific traits (physical attractiveness not being one of them) but I am simply of the opinion that romantic relationships are not really designed for that overall."
Demotivational,1k5m35,gazork_chumble_spuzz,0,Tue Aug 13 03:42:55 2013 UTC,"Yes, saying that being healthy is more valuable than being overweight is TOTALLY like being racist or homophobic.    That's not what you said. You didn't say ""being healthy is more valuable"". You said ""fat people are inferior"" when it comes to relationships. And that is NO DIFFERENT than saying Jews or gays are inferior at relationships - it's prejudiced. You can try and spin it however you wish, but it's a prejudiced and untrue thing to say.   I am a self-hating overweight person, because you told me so.   Don't you dare put words in my mouth.

Nobody would be questioning her motives for dating if she were fat like him. The fact that these questions arise when a fat dude dates a hot woman is evidence that people feel like he doesn't deserve to date a woman that hot, and would not in fact be with her at all if not for the money he has.   It does not, unless you assume ""lovable-ness"" is the only factor in selecting a mate.   It does, in fact, imply that - the assumption being made is that she is not with him because she loves him for who he is, but rather because he's got money that he spends on her. The implication behind that assumption is that of course a thin and attractive woman would not be interested in this guy for anything other than a fat wallet.

Psychological research shows that people generally have relationships with people of equal attractiveness to themselves (because you don't want to shoot below your weight but also people above you don't want to settle with you either). Obesity potentially shows unhealthiness, lack of discipline, inability to protect family etcetc, so it definitely is a little weird that a beautiful woman would aim for somebody like that when they have everything going for themselves. Money is generally assumed in these situations because it bridges the gap between the two levels of desirability.   Obviously BBW lovers exist, it's just a bit of an odd phenomenon."

But divergent patterns happen and frequently. And just because someone is overweight doesn't mean they are not healthy. The genetic factors of primal man drew heavy attraction (pun intended) to people who could put weight on. I mean look at old fertility statues from primitive man. Even up till the 1800s plump and voluptuous women were more popular than ""sickly"" frail ones. And the same could be said for men as well most of the time till the late 1880s and the Kellogg effect.  I'm not saying morbid obesity is positive but in our society with its low nutrition high calories the body will do anything it can to get it. I recently upped my nutritional content and just put my calories at 1800 and in one month i already lost 35 lbs and i'm actually more full faster. Even on days i think i might be pigging out when I add the calories up i'm still under my 1800 calories."
Demotivational,1k5m35,tanyax14,1 point,Mon Aug 12 17:48:24 2013 UTC,"Yes being overweight is still attractive in many cultures today - mostly in poorer ones, especially tribes. This is because it indicates wealth, plentiful food, not likely to starve to death particularly soon (whereas sickly frail ones would have a hard time even giving birth oftentimes). And interracial relationships are still the minority as far as I'm aware. But I imagine 'the other' principle is becoming more and more obsolete as our culture becomes more multiracial and general attitudes towards 'others' improve."

Maybe nobody died in the last drawing (whichever one you are referring to) but if you counted the entire number of people who had ever been in a car accident on the way to purchase a ticket, and the number of winners, the number killed would be greater.   PS: I guess if you want to be pedantic you could say most likely are greater because there is a non-zero chance all the people driving to buy lottery tickets were somehow much more lucky in their driving abilities than the average driver despite their lack of luck in winning the lottery."

For the Euromillions it's around 1 in 100 million.   Just because your odds are staggeringly high doesn't mean it is impossible.

Fasfa is great if your parents have no jobs or make less than minimum wage, but the average middle class kid will get nothing because it assumes your parents will pay out of pocket.   Again, I'm not complaining, I'm paying nothing out of pocket. I'm very fortunate.   All I am saying is that education is expensive. Public schools get expensive as well, in state or not.

Demotivational,1jnj37,bobwoodshed,2,Sun Aug 4 19:06:31 2013 UTC,"Only about 50% of people pay federal income taxes. Gotta be specific with that. This, of course, makes sense when you see things like the McDonalds budget from a few weeks ago. As long as it's the right 50% paying, that seems fine. Squeezing 15% from people making under 20k won't do shit for the budget. I don't mind people who can't afford taxes not paying taxes, as long as they're doing so legally. What I don't like is rich people getting richer and richer because their income is being taxed at a much lower rate than someone making less money than them. That is a ridiculous concept."
