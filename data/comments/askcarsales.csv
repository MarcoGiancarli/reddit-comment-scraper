askcarsales,3dw1ja,I_Love_McRibs,5,Mon Jul 20 00:26:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, go to your dealer. 1996 should be a plain metal key (no chip) so it shouldn't be too expensive."
askcarsales,3dw1ja,TheRealMeatloaf,2,Mon Jul 20 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"If you have the key code, that's what it's there for.  Go to your dealer."
askcarsales,3dw1ja,RexRaider,2,Mon Jul 20 01:09:04 2015 UTC,Yes they will be able to order the key and cut it based on the code.
askcarsales,3dw1ja,TeamDisrespect,2,Mon Jul 20 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"Take it to your local hardware store and ask them if they'll duplicate it.  When they cut a key, its not an exact duplicate - they'll (attempt) to cut it as if it weren't worn and warped.  Granted the key may be so damaged that their equipment won't be able to work with it - but I'd say, still check with them before engaging Toyota.  It will be much cheaper (just a couple bucks), and much faster (they'll do it right then)."
askcarsales,3dw1ja,psdy45,3,Mon Jul 20 01:06:23 2015 UTC,"If the key is worn, OP will wind up with a bad copy of a bad key.  Those duplication machines trace the key and duplicate what they find. In this case that's beyond useless."
askcarsales,3dw1ja,TheRealMeatloaf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:17:25 2015 UTC,"It depends on just how worn it is, whether its the original key or if itself is a duplicate, and the quality of the original key.  Often a skilled operator can machine a like-new key even from a worn original - it just depends on the factors above.  I've had pretty good luck at my local hardware store, in fact, on Toyotas of about that vintage.  Now maybe I'm just lucky, or maybe the guy at my local hardware store is some kind of wizard... but when it only costs me $2, I don't ask TOO many questions :-)  I'd still say you'd be insane not to try this route before engaging a dealer.  True, the key may be so damaged that it cannot be duplicated - but it doesn't really cost anything to at least investigate."
askcarsales,3dw1ja,psdy45,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:25:31 2015 UTC,Old school keys are like $10 at the dealer. Why go get one of those Mickey Mouse hardware store keys when you can get a nice rubber head oem key for $6 more ?

The cost was not too high and the key worked perfectly.  Prior to that I'd gone to a couple hardware stores and had keys made and they could never make one that worked great even on multiple trys.  I did not try a locksmith as there were none close by and I thought of the Toyota dealer before that.    I actually worked in a key shop many years ago when they had them outside of every Sears and Montgomery Wards store (how's that for dating myself).   I know what's involved in cutting a key and I knew how to cut a key from a badly worn original.  None of the places I've been to recently, or when I had that problem, knew how to even begin to approach that.  Getting one cut from codes at the dealer is definitely the right way to do it."
askcarsales,3dw1ja,cubical_hell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:09:34 2015 UTC,"Not in car sales, but:  I did this once with an old Toyota that had worn keys.  Had problems getting a duplicate that worked reliably at the hardware store or similar places.  Cost at dealer was more than getting a regular key made at hardware store but was reasonable.  And it worked perfectly all the time.  I'm not sure but I think in my case the dealer was able to look up the key codes to make a key using the car's serial number.  They did require me to show them the car's registration and my ID before they cut the key for me."
askcarsales,3dv1n2,Wardless,4,Sun Jul 19 19:20:21 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, you should be able to go to ANY new/used dealer and ask them to facilitate.  That doesn't mean all dealers will be interested in messing with this and you'll probably find a higher-end used dealer that's willing to do it for a reasonable fee.  $500 to push the paperwork wouldn't be unusual.  Basically that dealer is going to buy the car from Toyota Financial and sell it to you for an agreed upon price."
askcarsales,3dv1n2,skinny8446,2,Sun Jul 19 21:59:23 2015 UTC,I'd call the dealer and ask. I've done a lot of third party lease buyouts in the past. Most every dealer will charge a fee to do so because it's a bit more paperwork but it may be doable.
askcarsales,3dv1n2,TheRealMeatloaf,2,Sun Jul 19 20:32:45 2015 UTC,"I just did this with my dad's leased Prius. I had no idea what I was doing, and still don't really know what I just got lucky with and what was actually done correctly. In CA, FWIW.  I did learn that the dealer has nothing to do with the lease. Toyota owns the car. The dealership just filled out the initial paperwork. I never talked to the dealership my dad leased the car at; everything was done through Toyota Lease Trust. You don't need to do an inspection.  Toyota as a company doesn't allow third-party buyouts. (You=third party. Your sister and Toyota are first two parties.) I got the lease paperwork from my dad, read everything, which includes the buyout process and amount. This was three months out from lease-end. I didn't want the next steps to prolong beyond the lease-end date.  I sent the check for the buyout amount to Toyota. Here starts the weird part. Technically, Toyota can't sell the car to anyone but my dad, but accepted the check anyway. Toyota then sent the Vehicle Transfer Form to my dad filled out with his information. At this point, the car is ready to be put in my dad's name, but he needs to register it, which includes paying the sales tax (a few thousand here).  I had another Vehicle Transfer Form from my dad to me. He signed both forms and I took them to the DMV. With those forms at the DMV, I registered the car in my name. Since it was a ""gift"" from father to son, no taxes were paid. I don't know if I just got lucky with someone at the DMV or if that's actually the way it's done, but I now own the car. Sibling transfers aren't tax-free in CA, maybe they are in MA.  Bottom line: Overdo the paperwork. Have everything signed ahead of time. Maybe even try a few different DMV employees until it's completed. Or maybe it's not as complicated as I though and I just didn't know what I was doing. I felt overwhelmed the whole time, but it worked out just fine in the end."
askcarsales,3dv1n2,transmutethepooch,2,Mon Jul 20 05:58:54 2015 UTC,She would have to buy the vehicle from Toyota and then sell it to you. She can go to any Toyota dealer to facilitate this.

On top of that, Honda stopped making them, so there aren't a lot around. Hence, they are expensive.   It's a shame Honda stopped making them during the financial crisis.

Fair purchase price according to pricing I did for San Diego is $17,500. BUT, it is a rare car, during a popular time for convertibles and the dealer can ask whatever they want.  If you walked in and offered me $10k on any S2000 I had, which is never because it has been 3 years since my Honda dealer has seen one, I would laugh and say ""have a nice day"". Fair purchase price according to pricing I did for San Diego is $17,500.  It always takes the right buyer for any car. I have had Mustang GTs sit on the lot for a full 60 days and they go to auction, I have had others bought the day they hit the lot.

While I've read that loans from a credit union are going to have a better interest rate and terms, I've been told by a few people that dealer financing can be good when trying to get a closeout deal. The logic being: the dealer will lose money or break even on the sale price of a car, If the dealer knows they can get the money back on the financing side of the deal. Is there any truth to this advice? Thanks Again"

You don't want a car that's had the piss beaten out of it and unless your dad is a member of #stancenation, I doubt he'll want to drive around in a modded car.  The prices your parents are looking to spend are for non CPO vehicles, so you'll spend less money but you'll lose the low APR and the BMW warranty. I'd crunch the numbers, but with a good third party warranty and even at 4.9% APR you could still come out quite far ahead of the CPO BMW in terms of dollars and cents."
askcarsales,3du5lf,TheRealMeatloaf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll look into it.  The car is for my dad. I won't right a whole story here. We needed a new car, we wandered over to the BMW dealership., I was 18 and wanted to learn stick. We bought the only stick car in the lot, happened to be turbo charged. They had not even priced it as they got it literally less than 24 hours ago, we bought it the next day. And he's loved every minute of it. I don't get to drive it a lot, my dad takes it to work, and uses it one business trips. But every time he hits the on-ramp, he punches it and he loves it. The 07' is showing its age, so we decided to try and sell while it still has value.  The car is probably only for maybe the next 3 years. We've got the project car in the garage almost ready, and all of my siblings are getting to the age of leaving, within 3 years. So my dad will have his car ready by the time I graduate, and then all he needs is the focus, for when its raining or winter.  I'll have a shop around again. The biggest issue is finding a car. There don't appear to be a lot of 2010/11 335i out there for around 25, with less then 80k.   Thanks a lot."

askcarsales,3dt38c,BuyersAreLiars,2,Sun Jul 19 06:28:10 2015 UTC,Depends if the bank is allowed to keep it on hand or the state sends it out. It varies by state. But usually in that case the title is handed to you or mailed to you. The seller no longer has control once money and contract has changed names at the bank.

There will always be an ongoing job to replace or rebuild stuff no matter how nice it starts out.  Do you have tools, a garage, and a second car as backup?

The previous owner can be as honest as possible, you can do all your due diligence, but something can still fail right after buying it. That's the breaks of an old car.

The website is down, but if it's the 1.9 diesel, both the new and older versions are well regarded, although with some foibles. Guessing the awd system is haldex based, which means special fluid changes are critical every 40K miles.  You might hit up the forums in TDIclub.com. This isn't a combo that was sold in the US, so we won't know the nuances as well as a specialized resource.

askcarsales,3dqqb0,carmicdy,2,Sat Jul 18 20:15:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. The market on that car is crap right now.
askcarsales,3dqqb0,Way2evil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:53:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have much, if any equity.  I'd be surprised if it's more than a few hundred bucks.  If this car had 36k miles you'd drop it off and run away because the resale on that gen hasn't held up.  They're just not popular and someone can grab a hugely improved '13 model for a few bucks more.  The buy-price of $16,100 is good though, just not as a wholesale number.  Leasing a car with such little usage really doesn't make sense to me.  You're basically forcing yourself to overpay for a car and hoping maybe you get some back on the tail end.  If you're going to risk being susceptible to market swings, you might as well buy it.  At least you'll have more flexibility down the road."
askcarsales,3dqqb0,Quackledork,-5,Sat Jul 18 21:08:01 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as ""lease equity.""  You either give it up at the end, or buy it.   You might be able to sell the car for more than the payoff. If it is in such good shape, then put an ad on Craigslist and try to sell it. When you do, take the left over money (after paying off the car) and go lease another car.   You cannot really ""trade in"" a lease to the dealership where you leased it. They are just going to wait until the lease it up. Another dealer might give you more than the payoff. But it is very rare that the residual on a car is lower than its market value. Even in excellent shape."

They want you to work out the financing so you're committed (mentally) to buying a car.  That way when it takes a week instead of 24 hours you're disappointed but still a buyer.

I know the real value of the car is 14.5k at 60k.   What I guess I didn't make clear is that my question really  is: is there usually wiggle room of 10% of initial dealer quoted price? 16k to 14.5k is about a 10% drop.

askcarsales,3dmvtl,ethnicgoat,7,Fri Jul 17 15:46:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, tell the dealer to swap out the rotors and service the calipers while they're at it.  The old rotors had a coating of friction material from the old pads, and the new pads are certainly composed differently so they're almost guaranteed to squeak.  Unless the squeal was caused by the wear indicator, to fix a squeal properly you need to do rotors and pads and service the calipers while they're all apart.  Dealership tried to save a few dollars and it's going to cost them in the end. Enforce your contract terms, but be reasonable about it. If you go in there like a charging bull they're likely to just clam up and start ignoring you."
askcarsales,3dmvtl,TheRealMeatloaf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:09:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, I will go and talk to them again."
askcarsales,3dmvtl,theburnout,3,Fri Jul 17 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"You are not being unreasonable by asking them to fulfill a their end of a contract.  If they didn't want to deal with this, they shouldn't have agreed to it."
askcarsales,3dmvtl,b3h3lit,3,Fri Jul 17 16:24:48 2015 UTC,If it is part of the contract it is fully their responsibility to fix the brakes at no cost to you. If you don't want to deal with it you can ask them to unwind the deal.
askcarsales,3dmvtl,ShittyFieldTech,6,Fri Jul 17 17:07:36 2015 UTC,"If they spent $700 in pads without changing the rotors, it's their own fault.  Tell them to pound sand and replace the rotors.  EDIT:  How many miles have you put on the pads since they've changed them?"

askcarsales,3dmvtl,TheRealMeatloaf,2,Fri Jul 17 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"So, a bit of an update. I went in they said they would order rear rotors and service the calipers. They refused to do so unless I signed the paper stating that I would drop it even if the squealing persists. I did not sign and left. What would be the next step?  Thank you everyone for your replies."
askcarsales,3dmvtl,pussydrip,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:55:26 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly if they replace your entire set of pads and rotors, they'll have done all they can.

askcarsales,3dmvtl,pussydrip,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I should try to get the front brake pads to Honda as well as both rear and front rotors replaced and all calipers serviced, and that should be fine to sign off on  Also, is it okay if the rear brake pads were used on the older rotors? I'd assume that it will squeak for a bit until it is worn off."

I live in CA if it helps.   If you have a loan, yes.   I use to have great credit, almost maxed but I haven't worked for about 3 years until now. I haven't missed any payments on my credit card but I do owe quite a bit and its almost maxed, so will I have a hard time financing? Thanks!   Possibly. See you local credit union to get a baseline.

askcarsales,3dm8gd,BuyersAreLiars,3,Fri Jul 17 12:18:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you pay less.  It will reduce your money factor some amount but that varies by MFG."
askcarsales,3dm8gd,rodion_kjd,2,Fri Jul 17 12:58:20 2015 UTC,"How much less do you pay? Is it even worth the hassle because If I'm only saving hundreds vs thousands then It would make more sense to me just to pay monthly?  Let's say I purchased a car for $21000 + 1.098 tax (in WA) = $23058..  The MSRP of the car is 26000 and the residual is .57 = $14820  $23058 - $14820 = $8668  $8668/36 Months = $241 / Month  $23058 + 14820 * (6%APR/2400) = 95.82/month on interest  Total of the lease would be $336.82 a month  and a total interest of $3098 in 3 years.   Now if I bought the car and paid it off in 6 years, I would be saving money vs leasing it...   How would I be paying "" less ""?"
askcarsales,3dm8gd,rodion_kjd,2,Fri Jul 17 12:59:59 2015 UTC,"Well... you'd be paying less in the sense that for the lease you'd pay a total of $12,000 or so and if you bought the car you'd pay over $23,000.  If you're asking how a 1-pay lease saves you money again, it is different by MFG.  I can tell you in Porsche land it only saves you a few hundred dollars so, other than being convenient, it isn't really worth it."
askcarsales,3dm8gd,Micosilver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:11:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's the answer I was looking for. If it's not worth it then I might as well increase my credit over 3 years and pay monthly on time each month. Thank you - have a up vote."
askcarsales,3dm8gd,rodion_kjd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:19:56 2015 UTC,"His answer is correct - it depends on the manufacturer and mainly the bank.  The effect of a lease on your credit is the same, whether you pay upfront or monthly."
askcarsales,3dm8gd,_Darksun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:41:27 2015 UTC,After a little bit more thinking the only way I would save on interest is putting down more down payment is that correct or paying towards the principle when I pay my monthly dues?
askcarsales,3dm8gd,jayendo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:16:09 2015 UTC,"Neither.  A lease is all pre conditioned.  The total capitalized cost is the total capitalized cost.  You can pay it in 36 payments or you can pay it in 30 payments or you can pay it in 20 payments with $10,000 down or $0 down or anything else.  Still the same."
askcarsales,3dm8gd,jayendo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:37:13 2015 UTC,"Ahh I see, thanks for that information. I see that you work for Porsche, do many people even lease since they are higher-end cars? It seems that it would be dumb to lease a expensive nice car unless your business is paying for it?"
askcarsales,3dm8gd,jayendo,2,Fri Jul 17 19:43:22 2015 UTC,"There is technically no ""interest"" on a lease. In place of a interest rate you have a ""money factor"". It's my understanding if you make one payment it's the same as making all the monthly payments. So you would get no sort of discount."
askcarsales,3dm8gd,TeamDisrespect,3,Fri Jul 17 12:41:28 2015 UTC,"But doesn't that ""money factor"" vary from what my APR is... Which essentially is APR/2400?  APR is affected by my credit on what tier level I fall into, so if I'm not getting a ""loan"" from the bank but paying the 3 year lease up front, why would it make sense to pay the money factor?"
askcarsales,3dm8gd,skinny8446,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:45:45 2015 UTC,"you do not avoid ""interest"" or the money factory by paying up front, and no paying up front will not help if you have bad credit. if you don't like the answer tough shit, it the way it is and how leases work and how the they are calculated, you are still borrowing an entire car and driving it although you only end up paying a portion of it."
askcarsales,3dm8gd,chickentikka69,3,Fri Jul 17 13:01:22 2015 UTC,I don't think you read my response correctly.   I was stating that having different a higher or lower credit will affect what tier I fall into which changes the total money factor.

Until then you're a retail customer.  Is $22k the cheapest one in the area?  That's your starting point.  If it's the most expensive (comparable age and miles) then find the cheapest retail one and use that as a starting point.

askcarsales,3dnof5,jbourne0129,4,Fri Jul 17 19:20:23 2015 UTC,All good here. He can't really do a lot with a copy of a title. Especially if he is not in possession of the bike. The bank wants proof that this loan is going to the actual bike as well as to make sure the title has no liens (very important as the bank would have to pay the lien off).  It sounds strange but thiefs try to get secured loans (car loans) without the security actually existing. It is easier to get a secured loan since there is an actual asset that can be repossessed if need be.   I have been dealing with the same finance company for years that I use to short term finance a little of my inventory. After 5 years they still someone out every week to make sure I actually have the cars that I told them I purchased.
askcarsales,3dnof5,savyur,3,Fri Jul 17 19:48:46 2015 UTC,"That's fine. Once the buyer gets the loan approved, they will cut you a check for the amount and then you sign the title over to the bank.

Very much agree. Unless you have a lawyer friend who will give a huge discount or are willing to throw money away out of spite, a lawyer almost definitely isn't going to be worth it.  No lawyer worth talking to would take this on a contingency, so you're going to be paying $200-500 an hour and paying probably a sizable retainer if you want the lawyer doing anything more than sending a few letters.

Check your state law, but generally it falls under something like this in the best case scenario. Even then, they are only obligated to fix certain items or pay for a partial fix, depending on state laws.    Ask in your regional reddit for a mechanic recommendation closer to the seller. They are unlikely to allow a cheap car like that to go that far.  Keep in mind this is a $1K car. They aren't going to fix much if anything, and there will be plenty of stuff to fix on a $1K car. A non-running car is on average worth $500 to $800 to a junkyard. You aren't going to get much, nor will it likely last very long."

Your lease will basically get paid off by GAP and insurance."

However if you lease a car and it gets totaled...well you no longer have a lease...you also don't get any money cause you don't own the car.

Oh, and you can finance that at 0.72% APR.  Saving less than $4k for a car with less equipment that's 2 years old, almost 30k on the clock, only one year left on the comprehensive warranty with a crap maintenance history? Pass!  Tell them they haven't done enough oil changes, their car doesn't have enough equipment and that they're dreaming and move on to one that's more realistically priced.  For the record, my 2014 EcoBoost Fusion has 21k on the odometer and I've already done 3 oil changes. The EcoBoost is a turbo charged engine, which makes it even more important to perform regular oil changes. If/when the turbo fails, good luck getting a warranty claim out of Ford.

The turbo is lubricated and cooled by the engine oil. If a turbo charged engine doesn't have its oil changed religiously, the turbo will gum up, the bearings will fail and the car will generate about 1/4 the horsepower it was designed to create, and that will cost a few thousand to fix.

It doesn't make sense to purchase a car and trade it in every couple years. As /u/ilgner pointed out it's a huge savings to lease.

askcarsales,3dkp4a,techmattr,2,Fri Jul 17 16:45:14 2015 UTC,"With most leases you can buy protection. Like $700~$1500 from my experience. It was worth it for the BMW since my wife is.... we'll say ""not so careful"". We just did an end of lease meeting with our BMW dealer and when they looked at the lease agreement they said they didn't even need to look at the car since we had end of lease protection. It was ~$1300 for the X1 we have. They said if we didn't have that you're allotted up to like 5 dings the size of a half dollar coin or something like that. Beyond that you would have to pay for whatever they would charge you to fix it. Which would be way over what you could get done at a body shop or detail shop depending on the level of damage.   They said about the same thing at Hyundai. We were offered an end of lease protection for about $900 if I recall. I didn't bother with it since I was going to be driving the Hyundai the most and I don't use the car much at all. I work from home quite a bit so it sits.  tldr; If you're ding/scratch prone look into end of lease protection. If you're not, just plan on getting a good detailing to fix minor issues prior to turn in."

I've seen higher requirements once or twice.  Many people don't carry limits this high (though most people should).  So, in a sense, leasing can increase insurance costs. Not because it's a lease, but because the leasing company requires certain limits.  If your limits are already this or higher, then there would be no difference in your insurance costs.

askcarsales,3dkp4a,ilgner,-3,Fri Jul 17 01:32:09 2015 UTC,"I leased a Honda Civic and every week was a challenge in keeping mileage low. Before you dive into a lease, be absolutely sure you can stay under that mileage amount.  If you are a numbers guy (which I've become since leasing that car), it is financially unsound to lease. You are paying for the car's depreciation in those first 2-4 years. Then you are required to give it back to the dealer unscathed. The dealer makes out like crazy on this deal, because now they have a clean, gently used car to resell.  The best value for a person is buying a new car right off the lease. It's new(ish) and remarkably lower than a brand new sticker price."
askcarsales,3dkp4a,jordannite,4,Fri Jul 17 01:33:31 2015 UTC,"its not unsound unless the math does not make sense. lease what depreciates, buy what appreciates.  for example (generic and off the hip, i'm not using an actual msrp/residual, but i do have a general idea from leases i've done)  ~20500 corolla. (i'm not counting taxes, interest, etc.) residual is ~12,300 on 36mo 12kmi lease  finance for 60 mos: ~$341/mo  lease for 36mos: ~$227/mo  over those 3 years you spent ~12,276 on the regular loan, yet on the lease you spent ~$8172. $4104 in savings.  you then lease a similar corolla, with all the latest safety and tech upgrades in that price range, keeping the same payment (not that this happens exactly like that, but for argument's sake).   after 5 years you've paid the 20,500 plus taxes and any interest (if you didn't get 0%), while on your first and second corolla, you've spent ~13620.   Further, toyota pays for the first two years of maintenance, so you've only paid for a single oil change in all of this, not to mention had a full warranty for the entire duration with no out of pocket expense.  You saved ~$6880 over this time period.  how exactly is this unsound?  ps. toyota charges $0.10 per mile in advance, $0.15 as the penalty. not too bad unless you go ridiculously over, however to make up the difference in cost, you would have to go over ~27,360 miles on the first lease to make up its difference in cost. (~45,886 miles between the two leases in the two year time frame, though this is not a good comparison as the second wouldn't be up yet)"
askcarsales,3dkp4a,TheRealMeatloaf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:08:20 2015 UTC,"it is unsound because while you have saved money with the lease, you come away with nothing in the end. While after the 60 mo finance is over, you have yourself an asset."
askcarsales,3dkp4a,ilgner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"An asset that's worth ... ?  If you spend $9000 over the course of a 3 year lease, over 6 years you'll spend $18,000 and drive two brand new cars.  Otherwise, you could spend $20,000 over the same time frame to buy the same car over a 72 month finance, and at the end you're likely to have an asset worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $2000.  So over the course of 6 years, knowing that you'll spend $18,000 either way, would you rather;   Drive two brand-new cars, both under full factory comprehensive warranty including road side assistance over your entire term of ownership, or Drive a single brand new car, with the warranty coverage slowly falling off of it until you're still making payments but have zero mechanical or electrical coverage?   Myself, I'm banking on option #1, thanks.  If you want to be truly fiscally sound, you'll find a 3-4 year old car with low average miles, clean history, perfect maintenance history that's well known to be reliable. Shop around to find the best deal you can find, pay cash for the car and ride it out for the next 12-15 years.

It seems like everyone is telling me that I can't lease but I can't afford to buy a used car because I don't physically have the money right now, I would be accumulating by paycheck (I know this is stupid, but as I have NO Other expenses it's ok with me for now). Not sure what the answer is here. I ran numbers and found that it could cost me about 6k to lease a car. I wouldn't have anything worth anything after 3 years but this is fine. If I were to buy a car, for say 6k and have it miraculous last me all 3 years with no issues, what would I have at the end of those 3 years? What would a car even be worth at that point? To me, it doesn't seem like much of a difference   Edit: this is more of a need than a want IMO. for work, i need a car and if i'm out of a car because it's in the shop, i'm out a job. then i survive off about 2.5k for the whole year w/o a source of income. if i lease a car, i thought it would be ~1.8k in fees, which i'd have, and then some left, and then making 400 per month off the books nannying i'd be able to cover the monthly payments. I've run the number and it just seems like a better option.

You need a car so you can afford to go to a job that pays you $300-400/month, you need the job so you can afford the car.  The problem is, after payment, gas, maintenance and insurance you'll be literally working for a car.  Generally accepted good practise where personal finances are concerned say you should only devote between 15-20% of your income towards transportation. Even if you're bringing home $500/month, that leaves you upwards of $125 to pay for a car payment, gas, maintenance/repairs and insurance. If you were to get an inexpensive beater that you pay for outright with your $2500 cash in hand, I'm sure that could be accomplished.  It's a tough spot, no doubt, but it's not going to get easier if you devote your entire working life to a set of wheels and a motor.  You're obviously in a part time job, an employment status that would be referred to as Part-Time Casual. The biggest problem with those jobs is lack of hours and lack of stability. You could be scheduled for 20 hours one week and 5 hours the next. You could be let go pretty well any time and you have no recourse and no cushion to fall back on.  Let's play out a scenario. Let's assume you lease a car. Your monthly expenses for lease payment and insurance come to $275. Now let's say in 4 months you lose your job.  Now that you've spent virtually 100% of your savings on taxes, fees, down payment and first payment, how are you going to afford to meet that $275 monthly obligation?  It sounds to me as if you're heading towards a credit and insurance nightmare."
askcarsales,3diz9q,RexRaider,6,Fri Jul 17 16:47:42 2015 UTC,what about insurance?
askcarsales,3diz9q,bangtime,4,Thu Jul 16 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"I just looked at the Toyota/Honda lease specials on my website.  You are going to have to look for something like a civic, corolla, mazda3, focus...potentially a fit or fiesta if you don't mind subcompacts.  Along those lines.    What I would do?  Get a Priusc.  The lease is similar to the corollas and civics I saw then you get ~50mpg and about a 400 mile range.  That is a great value, for under $200 a month.  DISCLAIMER: I don't know where you live and your rates and lease specials will be at least a little bit different."
askcarsales,3diz9q,bangtime,2,Thu Jul 16 18:18:28 2015 UTC,So... finding 140/month 0 down and 1.8k total fees at signing for a corolla vs. 170/mo. 0 down and 2.1k in fees at signing for the priusc. In your opinion will that extra 30 plus extra fees end up to be less than the money you'd be spending on more gas for the corolla since the prius is better mpg?
askcarsales,3diz9q,Sadukar09,3,Thu Jul 16 18:38:54 2015 UTC,"**Edited original comment Stick with the cheapest possible, I read that as 300-400 a week not month.  Budget will be tight but if you need transportation it is your best option.  I went to school once, you'll probably have enough time to get some more part time work if it gets too tight.  The payments are closer on the lease specials I looked at.  In your position i'd go with the Corolla, make it an S because you are young and should drive something at least a tiny bit sportier.  && those wheels, so much better on the S."

Performance wise, the base model vs. S Plus (for those wheels) isn't even that much. And then OP needs to pay more for something he might not need.   At the price of the Corolla S Plus/Premium, might as well get the Civic Si. Much much better car for slightly higher or same price."
askcarsales,3diz9q,bangtime,2,Thu Jul 16 20:23:15 2015 UTC,There is no performance difference between S and base.  I meant to edit that part out too because I had blitzed through his question and misread his income.

I'll check it out.

But I stand by what I said because, $2000 doesn't get you anywhere close to a good vehicle.  I see every day what a $2000 vehicle looks like and the problems it comes with.  Even if he had $5000 he wouldn't be able to get a vehicle that would meet his needs without exposing himself to a lot of risk.  Vehicles are machines, machines break down, at 300-400 a month he has nothing to fall back on if he can't afford to repair the car.  There is so little exposure in a lease, if you are at least moderately responsible, it's the only option that makes sense if he needs transportation.  But let's be honest, he's going to realize how tight his budget is and figure out how to make more money.  I got salty earlier because you went on and listed a bunch of irrelevant achievements and bs.  That experience is about as relevant as the guy who helped a friend buy a car one time over the phone."

You take their Wants, their needs, and their desires and you find the best fit on the lot while also fighting against the stereotype that i'm a liar and a cheat.  I've done this for 4 years while you have been in the real estate industry for a period of time that is just as irrelevant as your experience.  The reason you are still arguing is that you think your experience in a different field better qualifies you to give advice in a field i've been in for 4 years.  I don't understand how any reasonable person could feel that way.    You are also looking at his ""budget"" the wrong way.  His total income and expenses are far greater than $400/mo.  You take into account tuition, room and board, food, school supplies and his budget is thousands per month.  With all the necessities taken care off.  He has a couple hundred dollars to take care of transportation left over.  But you think he should expose himself to unnecessary risk when he can afford a new, warrantied, reliable vehicle?

If you think a 2K car is more risk to the individual than a 3 or 4 year lease commitment when you have that little income your simply clueless. $400 a month is nothing, in any part of the country, even if literally every other fixed expense in one's life is paid for.   To the OP you have no idea what you are talking about. You DO NOT qualify for the lease. Your parents do. Your parents and you are co-responsible for the payment of the lease."

I have NEVER EVER seen a car for less that 3-4k and those ones are complete shit. I go to school in 3 weeks and would rather have a reliable car that only requires maintenance, not a $500 fix every fucking month.  Like I said, with no other expenses, 160 a month IS affordable. I'm 19 years old, I'm not paying bills or doing anything else where I have expenses during the month.   I understand that maybe I'd get lucky and get a car that doesn't need to be fixed for 5k or less. But I don't have 5k or less in my pocket RIGHT NOW. Not do I want to face the possibility of having to do repairs. I'd rather have a reliable car with better mpg with better customer service leasing from a dealer than buying it ""as is"" or from an owner that could scam you and rip you off. Been there and it's not something I want to even have the possibility of.  If I ask about leasing on this page, don't tell me that I can't afford it. That's not what I asked.  EDIT: I CAN qualify. My parent can cosign. I've spoken to dealers and had friends do this too- stop spewing shit that's not legit"

I had a 10k car in college and put like 2k down, not a brand new lease. I enjoyed when it was paid off because it wasn't a pile of shit and I still had no payments other than maintenance and insurance.  Making $400 per month is almost stupid to buy a car.

Sure you might need something expensive on occasion, but unless you buy a high-milage BMW odds are you're not dropping a car payment's worth of money on the thing every month.

askcarsales,3di7hf,rodion_kjd,5,Thu Jul 16 14:43:12 2015 UTC,In states where taxes and licensing fees are paid by the customer at the DMV the OTD pricing does not necessarily include these.

The trade in is the worst part, the stickiest, and the most confrontational so we like to get that out of the way immediately.  It can also keep you from wasting our time and us from wasting yours.  If you're $25,000 buried in your trade and you don't have a downpayment it simply isn't worth you driving anything."

I specifically told the dealer that I want to pay the minimum lease expense. They are actually going to give a check back when I get the car (still has to arrive since I ordered it) which is the trade in value, minus the finance debt minus the lease expenses minus the registration... She actually recommended that I do that."
askcarsales,3digba,xchx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:49:55 2015 UTC,"So basically you are not trading in but selling the car and no equity from your ""trade in"" is going towards the new vehicle?"
askcarsales,3digba,xchx,2,Thu Jul 16 17:01:27 2015 UTC,"Yes but the upfront cost is not zero, so some equity is going towards that. Let's put numbers, I still owe about 10K, the car was apraised at 16.5K, the lease minimum upfront cost is about 4.5K. So I will effectively give them my car, get a new one, and a 2K check."
askcarsales,3digba,pjpjr6,0,Thu Jul 16 17:05:39 2015 UTC,"You're not ""getting"" a $2,000 check as if it's some bonus. You just didn't apply all your equity to the deal. That doesn't change anything about the deal, other than your payment."

You will also usually get a slightly better number if the dealership knows you are buying from knows you are buying or leasing.  We get excited about leasing you a car just like you get excited about leasing one!  The number on your trade is the same whether you are buying and leasing.  If you are looking to find out the real number, get your lease information up front and then get a trade number.  Be prepared, though, because that number may be lower than if you bring it up in the beginning.  The fact is that if I know I have to show you $500 more than your vehicle is worth, I am keeping that cushion in my lease numbers.  You really are not getting a better or worse number on your trade, I'm just telling you what you want to hear.  When a guy walks in and says give me $10,000 on my trade or I'm walking, I'm showing him $10k on his trade even if it's worth $8500.  You can be sure that I have that $1500 I'm losing on your trade built in to the car he is buying, though."

askcarsales,3digba,classifiednumbers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:38:41 2015 UTC,"I was chuckling because focusing on any ""extra"" you're given on a trade when you're buying another vehicle will only distract you.

If you buy from a place based on it giving you the most money for your trade you could still be getting the worst deal in town when compared to another place that didn't pretetrademark give you more than your trade is worth but have a bigger discount on the purchased unit  Like what dogman was saying"

Let me know when you get to that perfect world and give me the address.  In this real world, dealers will occasionally lean on a trade to make a deal to move a new unit; I know this because I did it myself over the years, hundreds of times.  And to be quite honest, if a guy grinds me out for hours on a price, representing that he has no trade, and then pops me with a trade after all of that, all he did was piss me off and lower the likelihood of me stepping up on the trade.  With all of the information available out there nowadays, you should be able to go into a dealership with a pretty good idea of what your trade is worth and what the new car should be selling for anyway; I should think most negotiations are just working on the last few bucks anyway if you do your homework..."

Your family don't want to contribute towards the payments, yet they want free and full use of the car? I know it's family and all, but are you just looking to be used and abused?  If they won't even make the car payments, what happens in the case of an accident or other damage to the car? Mechanical/electrical fault in the car?!? You're just begging for trouble.

askcarsales,3di8md,chickentikka69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:24 2015 UTC,thanks! done and done
askcarsales,3di8md,aarong22,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:12:10 2015 UTC,First I think you need to figure out what size of car you want. The Pilot and CRV are two different size classes and the Outback is somewhere between them.
askcarsales,3di8md,falcon0159,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:16:40 2015 UTC,Ultimately we're ok with any of these 3 sizes given what I've described as wants. Size isn't the number 1 determining factor or filter for us figuring out which vehicle we want above the others. Not sure if that makes sense or not but hopefully it's clear.
askcarsales,3di8md,chickentikka69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"Makes sense to me! Out of the bunch, I'd go for the Pilot myself, especially because it's a brand new model and is (now) quite fancy! If you liked the compact size, I'd choose the Outback over the CRV. I'm not a huge fan of the CRV myself. Reliability is a wash between all of these models."
askcarsales,3di8md,falcon0159,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to say the CX-5 is a nice car (I own one), even it's highest trim should be toward the bottom of your budget but I'm not sure how it stacks up against the new Pilot"
askcarsales,3di8md,dapala1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:34:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion! Price is right as is engine but I didn't like some of the interior features. I'm also a very large broad 6ft 4 guy and the fit was so so.
askcarsales,3di8md,falcon0159,-7,Fri Jul 17 01:17:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think that you'll be able to get 10 years out of any modern car without a bunch of serious and expensive repairs. From what I've seen, most cars start falling apart at around 4-5 yrs and 50-60k where as the reliable brands will last maybe 7 years and 90k.  Definitely don't get a german brand if you want to keep the car long term. Although nice, the q5 is a complete POS after 5 years and will cost you thousands in repairs and maintenance annually from that point on.  I would suggest the nee 2016 pilot or 2016 rdx."

askcarsales,3dhyqh,Way2evil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:58:04 2015 UTC,I'm not attempting to sell the car here. I'm really just interested in if the auction commission is reasonable. The commission is the same for all the vehicles and most aren't worth $1k.
askcarsales,3dhyqh,KIDDizCUDI,3,Thu Jul 16 13:01:51 2015 UTC,He's asking for a reason. If the car is worth money the auctioneer might have a buyer come to the auction and sell it to them cheap. I see this happen at estate sales and public auctions all the time.
askcarsales,3dhyqh,Stretch2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:08:00 2015 UTC,Yeah if the car is a desirable one then you could get more $$.

askcarsales,3dhyqh,TheRealMeatloaf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:55:19 2015 UTC,Agreed. If they're 1k just sale them on Craigslist and include the required leg work in the details of each post. Might as well sale them a little cheaper privately through ads.
askcarsales,3dhyqh,savyur,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:11:04 2015 UTC,Sounds great to me. When I take cars to auction I spend about 14% in fees and it is on me to make sure they run. The auction will jump start but that is about it. Buyers fees are about right too.
askcarsales,3dhsba,Rngftw,3,Thu Jul 16 11:26:42 2015 UTC,truecar.com or edmunds.com should get you in the ballpark for your area.  I think there's a rule about knowing how to spell the brand's name before they'll sell you one though.

askcarsales,3diboc,okayshokay,3,Thu Jul 16 14:35:34 2015 UTC,"For the money it likely isn't the best car you can buy.  There's no way to tell how many more miles it will go but it is likely entering the end of it's life as anything that happens after 200,000 miles is a very, very expensive problem.  In other words if you're buying this intending it to be ""your car,"" as in the car that needs to take you to school/work/grandma's house every day, reliably, with minimal investment for the next few years you should look elsewhere."
askcarsales,3diboc,rodion_kjd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:03:01 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. I wanted to buy it to commute to school everyday 2 miles from my home. But I think I will look elsewhere now.

All cars have what we call a usable life - this car is reaching the end of that stage, and going to be going into sharp decline - just like most cars that are 16 years old and have nearly 200K miles. Additionally, these were complex cars when new, and those miles/years means there are plenty of things that will need attention.  Now if you're looking for a car upon which to learn how to work on cars, then this is a great choice. It has lots of unique technology for the time, and many owners are engineers who like to reverse engineer, diagnose, and come up with better solutions. So there are tons of DIY articles out there."

askcarsales,3dguuj,brucewillus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:31:42 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, the market in Colorado for new and pre-owned Subaru's is through the roof, and prices usually reflect higher than the national average.  So I would say yes, as long as the car is sound (take it to a mechanic for the love of god, it's out of warranty), I don't see why this isn't a good deal."
askcarsales,3dguuj,vertigo1083,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:35:52 2015 UTC,"Great, yeah it seems like a good deal. I'd be buying it through a sales agency (they work with my credit union and find cars for people) and he said he just had it checked out and replaced some things and has all the paperwork for this. If the paperwork looks good should I still take it to someone else? Also, when do these subaru's start to need big replacements like timing belts, cv joints, and such? I know that new brakes were just put in so that's taken care of."
askcarsales,3dguuj,vertigo1083,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:38:36 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly no expert on Subarus, and I wouldn't want to give you shot-from-the-hip advice on mechanical things.  If the place is reputable, and more importantly- backs their product (not just a mom and pop used car store with no service center in sight) I would say go on ahead, since they are offering you the maintenance records.    Be wary of 3rd party warranty companies, should you decide to take one that's offered.  Do research on the actual company before pulling the trigger.  Some of them are a complete waste of money and will honor little to nothing."
askcarsales,3dguuj,Nyy8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:46:02 2015 UTC,"I'll jump in, I have a little experience with the 4th gen legacys.   Oil changes every 5k miles (debatable, I've seen some do 10k on synthetic)   Timing Belt and water pump should be done together at 115k miles, if not a little before. But not before 105k miles, simply because it doesn't need it that early.  The boxer engine is bulletproof, just change the oil and it will run forever. Have fun with your Subaru, maybe take it snow drifting once or twice if thats your thing.   If you plan on driving in the snow, make sure to invest in some winter rims/tires. I have yet to see a subaru stuck with winter tires in the snow and we've had some bad storms in Connecticut.   Also, any questions after you own the car you can PM me or ask /r/subaru (make sure to post your new baby there too!)"
askcarsales,3dguuj,taco_bellis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:33:50 2015 UTC,"If its a reputable shop you should be good, but it cant hurt to have someone who has no vested interest in the deal check it out. If anything is wrong it should help you get money off the price.   To add to the timing belt and water pump as someone else said be aware that the N/A EJ engines are prone to head gasket failure.  I believe this was fixed by the time 08 came around though. But that is an expensive trpair if and when you do need it. Usually happens around 150k so houd have a while anyway"
askcarsales,3dguuj,_docious,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a pretty decent deal to me.  Bring it to a trusted Subaru mechanic like /brucewillus said and have them check all the things he listed, plus the head gasket.  Head gasket goes on almost all Subarus around 80k-100k miles."
askcarsales,3dg4nd,whyamihere78,5,Thu Jul 16 00:25:10 2015 UTC,basically we figure out the lowest you could buy your car new for: using simple numbers the car has an msrp of 55000. Some buyers may receive a loyalty rebate or military or college grad some may receive all 3 or maybe their are no rebates at all. All said and done the cheapest someone can buy the car is 50000. So if someone can buy one for 50000 what will someone pay for a used one $4000 less? So I have to sell the car for 46000. I am a business and also need to make money. So I'll give you 43-44000 for the car.
askcarsales,3dg4nd,Antiquecollector,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:35:44 2015 UTC,"$4k under retail is generally where we start on most newer, well cared for cars. So you are spot on what I would expect to be offering."

askcarsales,3dg4nd,TheRealMeatloaf,4,Thu Jul 16 02:16:55 2015 UTC,"Tough spot to be in. The sweet spot for trading a vehicle is about 3 years, hence all the advertised leases on TV being 36 months.   /u/antiquecollector pretty much hit the nail on the head with how the value is determined.   The only thing I'd add to that is run it by a carmax location and see what they'd offer you for it. Sometimes they pay money for cars that is beyond reason or comprehension."
askcarsales,3dg4nd,Apositivebalance,3,Thu Jul 16 02:12:13 2015 UTC,I have a theory that they are keeping the entire used car market prices over inflated. All I hear is they can't keep their hands down at the auction.
askcarsales,3dg4nd,Antiquecollector,3,Thu Jul 16 02:23:15 2015 UTC,That's pretty much it. I hate those guys so much. They bought something like 150+ cars last week at my Friday auction.
askcarsales,3dg4nd,carmicdy,3,Thu Jul 16 14:05:55 2015 UTC,"The power of deep pockets.  There's a used car dealer around my neck of the woods who controls the market on whatever particular car he wants to stock up on. A few years ago I remember him buying up every Buick Enclave, rough, clean and everything in between. He just averaged them out and for the next few weeks if you wanted an Enclave you went to his store."
askcarsales,3dg4nd,TheRealMeatloaf,3,Thu Jul 16 17:34:18 2015 UTC,Autotrader owns KBB and actually do buy vehicles now. If you're on the KBB site there should be an option for Autotrader to make an offer to purchase your vehicle.  This will just show you that when these guides have to actually put up an offer to own the vehicle they usually are thousands below dealerships who buy hundreds of vehicles every month.
askcarsales,3dg4nd,warmbedsheets,3,Thu Jul 16 01:35:44 2015 UTC,"-Unfortunately, you're not getting anywhere near those online values. They're just ballpark numbers, not a guide for dealers to follow. They will pay you wholesale. Luxury cars usually have their steepest depreciation during the first 3 years of ownership. The first year being the most.   -Going off the invoice, you probably bought an Advance Pkg model right? I can pickup a 2016 Advance (MSRP is $56k) for like $52k in my area, so there's no way you're getting 47ish for your 2015.   -Another important thing to note is that the 2016 got the updated transmission among other changes. That will bring down the price of the 15s also.  -Try Carmax for a baseline number."
askcarsales,3dg4nd,chickentikka69,2,Thu Jul 16 01:37:15 2015 UTC,They are going for around $44k-45k here with 5k miles 1 year old. $43k is a very fair trade offer. (new they are ~$51k and no incentives) 2014's with about 5-8k miles are going for $38-39k.
askcarsales,3dg4nd,IronSlanginRed,3,Thu Jul 16 01:38:44 2015 UTC,"as to why they are off of KBB and Edmunds, its because they don't sell cars. Look at what other used MDX's are in your area.

askcarsales,3dfg87,carmicdy,3,Thu Jul 16 20:08:12 2015 UTC,"Markup is largely irrelevant as cars are a market based commodity. If these cars are selling quickly for $23-24k in your area then they're right on the money and you may be hard pressed to get any discount at all. If they're slow sellers, they may have it priced low to compensate and raise interest, or on the flip side they may be willing to give a hefty discount to move it off their lot before it sits too long and ages.  At the other extreme, it could be really old stock and they're advertising it well below cost just to get it off their books.  There's also no way for anyone to tell how much a dealer has in a car anyways. We don't know where they sourced it, what they paid for it, what they paid the shop to re-condition it. Then on top of that they have additional expenses for CPO, advertising, lot pack, sales policy, etc.  They could be into the car for anywhere between $16-30k for all we know. Just do some research into your local market to see what they're selling for and make them an offer.  That all being said, unless you're in an area with an extremely low tax bracket, it's generally not possible to get a car out the door for less than the asking price. Used cars don't have factory incentives like new cars."

CPO#2 Same car, we steal this thing at 10k, put 500 in it through the shop, on the lot for 14k because the market for it is 14.5k, same car, $3500 in profit.

Why was the car hardly driven from October, 2014 to April, 2015?  Did the owner die, get arrested, get deployed?  Was it repossessed?  Did the car die or have mechanical failure on its drive off the lot?  Also, if you do a search on the VIN you can find cached listings for $20K, $19K and $18K.  Why now $14K?

askcarsales,3dgeq8,Way2evil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:34:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the perspective. I guess what i meant to ask here was; is there any reason why this car is priced as it is and is that reason due to some fault?   This car happens to be a model and make that I have been looking into, and slightly more than my price range but also NEW, CPO, seemingly great condition. Compared to other cars I've looked at, this one is the best option in almost every category. The fact that there is a warranty of sorts on it means that there is more than just a car I am buying, doesn't it? And this, along with low mileage, single owner, etc,  may protect me years down the line, something that another used car may not.  Like I said in the post, this is only something I am considering."
askcarsales,3dgeq8,FreedomsTorch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:20:31 2015 UTC,"There could be many reasons. Maybe someone bought it, couldn't get financed but already took delivery and now the dealer had to take the car back and sell it as used. You would have to ask them."
askcarsales,3dgeq8,yanman,2,Thu Jul 16 14:34:04 2015 UTC,My guess is the dealer took the car into inventory at the end of the model year. Mazda dealers have the option of keeping it as a new car and getting final paid on incentives or taking it into used inventory and selling it as CPO. The latter method is preferred since you not only get a new car sale but also a CPO sale which Mazda dealers have targets for as well.

askcarsales,3dfa59,maybe_no1,3,Wed Jul 15 20:33:06 2015 UTC,"Not really. Although, it depends on the car. A Mercedes C-class is high volume car, plenty of room to negotiate. Same with most Fords and GMs.  But if you're talking about a CLS63 or a BMW 6-series, those are less common and there is less negotiation."
askcarsales,3dfa59,Quackledork,2,Wed Jul 15 21:14:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe on the CLS63, but the 6 series is one of the most heavily incentivized cars in the BMW lineup. It's not uncommon to see near $10k off sticker if you know what you're doing."
askcarsales,3dfa59,chickentikka69,3,Wed Jul 15 22:04:04 2015 UTC,"Not really. BMW dealers sell 3/4 series like Toyota dealers sling Camrys. It's their bread and butter. You won't see American levels of discounting on a BMW, but there are decent discounts to be had on a 4 series. Just do your due diligence by checking Truecar, etc. In-stock units will probably see a higher discount than custom orders. Also, this is a bad time (if you want the newest) because the model year switchover is about to happen. You can get a good deal on a in-stock MY15 4 series."
askcarsales,3dfa59,chickentikka69,5,Wed Jul 15 22:06:53 2015 UTC,"Go to the forums at bimmerfest.com, locate the board sponsor nearest you, email for a quote. Although it might vary on specific models, you should expect to pay no more than $500 over invoice, less incentives. For a BMW, there is little reason to expect to pay more to order."
askcarsales,3dfa59,doublecards,4,Wed Jul 15 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"-Great advice about the sponsors, but $500 over invoice is probably not happening right now. The 2015s have ended production (according to the order guides on BF and BP.) 2016s start production 07/15 and 08/15 depending on the model. If he wants a deal, it's gonna be on a in-stock unit, not a custom order right now. (http://www.bimmerfest.com/pdf/bmw-pricing/2016/2016-SOP-EOP-Production-Information.pdf)  -Also if OP is considering a 435i, I'd highly suggest that he waits. The N55 engine is being swapped out for the B58. The 435i will be updated to the 440i soon."
askcarsales,3dfa59,chickentikka69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:48:43 2015 UTC,thank you both great info! I was leaning towards the 428 but if the price is right perhaps a 435 would be in the picture.  any news on when the new models will be out on sale or when the engine swap you mentioned will be out?
askcarsales,3dfa59,TheRealMeatloaf,2,Thu Jul 16 21:16:04 2015 UTC,"American auto makers tend to have large factory rebates on their cars which encourage a lot more discounting to make a deal. German and Japanese brands have far, far less factory incentives available and slimmer margins on the cars because they're more interested in preserving their residual (resale) values.  So no, you won't experience the same kind of discounting power on a BMW, Mercedes or similar as you've experienced with GMC."

askcarsales,3dervf,verdegrrl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:43:30 2015 UTC,"Another way to view it is that a brand new Civic LX MSRPs around $20K, but sells on average for $18K according to edmunds. You might get rebates or 0% interest as well, which can bring it into the $16K range.   As used car usually needs some reconditioning, in addition to having some of it's life already having been used up. So pricing needs to be compellingly lower than a new car to interest buyers. If they offer $11K, they will probably put another $1K back into it for reconditioning and advertising. That puts them at $12K - only $4K less than a brand new car with a full warranty."

askcarsales,3dernj,Johnnyrad904,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"Ask the owner if it has a short shifter in it.  I notice the shift knob is not stock. If so this car has been modded.  Ask if he has ever had the turbo replaced. If so run as far and fast as you can.  Ask the owner if he has ever removed the banjo bolts. If yes thats Great if no, refer to the question about the turbo being new or not.  This car has poorly designed filters in the oil feed and AVCS lines that choke, starve and lunch turbos/engines.  Also ask if has ever had the uppipe replaced.  There is a cat in the uppipe that can fall apart and also lunch the turbo/engine.  Make sure the rear hatch door locks correctly and check the radio for static.  The wire boots going to the rear hatch tend to leak corroding the wires.    Go do some research on subaruoutback.org and legacygt.com.   Your first and every oil change should have Rotella T6.  Turbos love Zinc.    See if the guy will do a blackstone oil test for you.    The engine bay doesnt bother me.  In fact I like it because the less clean it is the more likely it wasn't modded."
askcarsales,3dernj,zerobuddhas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:24:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response. I have been doing a lot of research on the forums. Regarding the turbo - why would it be bad if the owner replaced it? Couldn't the owner have replaced the turbo before it was destroyed? In a similar vein, is the turbo considered a wear and tear part, meant to be replaced? Some people on subaruoutback.org were talking about turbos in terms of % of life left, etc.   I'll make sure to ask about the banjo filter and uppipes. These parts tempt me into getting a pre-purchase inspection at a mechanic, but I'm not sure of how many Subaru mechanics/dealers are near where the guy lives. Would a regular (reputable) mechanic know how to check the banjo filter if asked? I couldn't tell if the banjo bolt is a part common in cars or unique to Subarus."
askcarsales,3dernj,zerobuddhas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:29:40 2015 UTC,Only a subaru specialist would know about these issues and I don't mean a dealer mechanic.  I mean someone who is a subaru enthusiast.  Most owners do not replace turbos unless they fail.  If the turbo on this car fails it sends shrapnel into the engine that is as difficult to remove as glitter from carpet.  And with those particulates circulating its matter of time even if there are no symptoms present.  So if the turbo was replaced for ANY reason get out because it means you have a new short block in your future.

Our owner drives certain used cars from our lot as a personal vehicle as well.  I mean, he owns the cars, so why the hell not?         I'm worried they might have taken the bulb for the check engine light out        What makes you think that? There's a simple solution to this.  Take it to a third party mechanic you trust and get it checked out.  If the dealer doesn't let you do this, walk away"
askcarsales,3deiz3,ofc-crash,3,Wed Jul 15 18:09:06 2015 UTC,Removing a bulb sounds like a shit-ton of work just to dupe someone.

askcarsales,3deiz3,skinny8446,3,Wed Jul 15 18:17:43 2015 UTC,It is very difficult to take out the check engine light bulb these days. It's usually part of a cluster of LED's. Very few places would go to such trouble.

Dealers didn't keep them for a reason. Avoid luxury brands. Even reliable Japanese brands are expensive.  German luxury out of warranty can quickly ruin you financially.

Your deductible may even be less than your car payment.  That $5k in beer money can disappear quickly if you get the wrong $5k car.    I agree that getting a cheap car is a good idea. I also think leasing is a good idea.  There are just less intangibles with leasing, and you can effectively budget with a lease when a $5k car could surprise you at any moment with a repair bill."
askcarsales,3dccxw,bangtime,4,Wed Jul 15 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"Leasing requires better than average credit to get the best rates. Do you have not only good credit, but good depth of credit (history of big ticket items)?  Do you have an income? Most leasing programs require an income.  There are college grad programs, but usually only for those who have graduated or very close.  Do you keep your car in good shape?

Without your name on the deal, you're going to have to do this all over again.  My recommendation, in the mean time, take out the biggest 3 year cash loan that's allowed, put it away in mutual funds, and pay off the monthly payments from fresh income to build your credit.

askcarsales,3dccxw,Quackledork,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:17:01 2015 UTC,"Leasing is great because it leaves your options open. It keeps your payment down and you don't need to put any money down, and at the end of your lease you can walk away, release, or buy the vehicle. If the vehicle is under your name and your mom cosigns, it can also help you build your credit so you don't need a cosigner in the future. People are saying that you shouldn't be locked into a ""fixed program,"" but that is why leasing is actually so great.

In a perfect situation, you should be trading in a paid-off vehicle as your down payment.  Barring that, your trade-in value should at least cover the entirety of what's left on the loan."

There's no point in making extra payments into your current loan, unless the APR is higher than all your other debt or investment return."

This happens from time to time but if the current owner owned both cars then he should be able to request a lost or stolen title for the second vin.

Went and talked to the DOT and they had a dealer investigator there who wrote the VINs down and is going to look into what happened to each. It does seem like the lien might be open, but since it is over 10 years old it's not valid.  Only other issue is that it looks like the VIN plate was the only thing replaced since it doesn't have the original rivets and is scratched and bent, which doesn't make sense if it was just a dash swap."

askcarsales,3dbaew,dokie1,2,Tue Jul 14 23:00:29 2015 UTC,that calculator should be fine but you need to ask for what fees get added to the selling price like the acquisition fee (non negotiable charge from the bank) and the dealer fee (if any) and likely your tag fees if you are not paying them out of pocket. These things all get listed differently on the contract and the dealer likely giving you the correct numbers as they appear on the contract just not the correct number to get the calculator to spit out the correct number.

(KY)  another is saying a deposit is required on a lease (jeep wrangler) ive never paid a deposit.   its kind of frustrating because these are the dealers who are willing to work with me on the msrp but makes me think they are trying to sneak some extra numbers in there."

askcarsales,3dajq4,Crowing91,-10,Wed Jul 15 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"There are two issues here and one has nothing to do with the other. If you tell the dealer your ""dilemma"", they're going to ""pay off"" your car, and make it up by charging you more for the new car you're purchasing from them. When you're in the market to buy a car, you're in the driver seat (so to speak) so don't be bullied into ""they're doing me a favor mentality"". First, negotiate the price with the dealer, and have an idea of a good price (by going to a website like truecar.com). DO NOT MENTION YOU HAVE A TRADE IN. After you negotiate the price, ask them what they're willing to give you for your car. If they're willing to pay it off, and that's what you're comfortable with then push for that by all mean, but you have to realize you're the buyer in this scenario.   They're going to ask you if you have a trade in, and when they do, just ignore them and keep the conversation about the price of the new car."

Yes, lie to the dealer. That's a good way to have a smooth, productive negotiation."
askcarsales,3dajq4,TheRealMeatloaf,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:04:13 2015 UTC,"So why do you guys always ask if I have a trade in when I walk into a dealership? You guys play every angle when a buyer walks into a dealership, and I'm sure you guys take count of the trade in's worth. However, if that's not ""how things work"" then why do I need to tell you whether I have a trade in? Why is that information pertinent when talking about a new car's price?"
askcarsales,3dajq4,mikec4986,7,Tue Jul 14 22:12:02 2015 UTC,"However, if that's not ""how things work"" then why do I need to tell you whether I have a trade in   Because one of the biggest complaints about buying a car is that it takes too long.  Well if we can't appraise your car while you are on a test drive then you add another hour onto the process.  Negotiate the numbers separately or together, I personally don't care.  But don't tell me 5 minutes to closing that now you have a trade.  That'll just piss me off and get you nowhere."
askcarsales,3dajq4,smbrickner,-3,Tue Jul 14 22:28:13 2015 UTC,"I knew that was going to be your reply. I took my car into carmax a few months ago, and they were able to give me a price in less than 30 minutes.   Look. The car buying process in the US is fucked up. I don't blame you or the dealer, trying to make as much money as possible on a deal, but the system is adversarial, and less information you have about my situation benefits me, and vice versa. I personally do all my negotiation on-line, and it's no skin off my back to withhold any information from you guys."
askcarsales,3dajq4,mikec4986,6,Tue Jul 14 22:37:02 2015 UTC,"they were able to give me a price in less than 30 minutes.    A price that you knew you weren't able to haggle on, that is the distinction.     withhold any information from you guys.    We deal with assholes everyday, so it's not like it would surprise any of us.  The car buying process is fucked up because people on both sides insist on using antiquated methods.  Email dealers and play them against each other (most dealers ignore those leads.  The ones that don't are the ones you don't want to deal with because they are ""forgetting"" a fee or something).  Parachute a trade and then complain the process takes to long....etc, etc.  It really doesn't have to be that hard.  In an hour or two of research you can determine who has the car you are interested in, what a fair price is, what type of interest rate you should be paying, and an approximate trade value.  You set an appointment at the place that has the car you want.  You negotiate a fair price based on your information, and you drive your car home."
askcarsales,3dajq4,smbrickner,0,Tue Jul 14 22:44:48 2015 UTC,"Well. You're one of the good ones then because car salesmen have their reputation for a good reason, and I'm sure I don't have to explain to you why. People automatically have their guards up when they walk into a dealer, and it's not because of paranoia. Assholes exist on both sides of the deal, but you would agree your side has the worse reputation when it comes to public opinion.   I personally don't know why people trade in their cars since the difference between trading it in and having a little patience to sell to a private party could be so significant."
askcarsales,3dajq4,mikec4986,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"most dealers have great reputations. The ones that don't have good reputations sell shitty cars for really cheap, and they don't care.  The reason we need to know you have a trade-in is because we need to work a whole deal. I can give you more on trade, less on the selling price, or a mixture that works out the same, but i can't write up the trade value at all if you wanted a no trade price. Feel free to work a selling price deal, but then you are going to get exactly the trade value that the dealership will be in it, because there will be no room for negotiation on that.  Also, a car that is broken is not going to be worth more private party. Sure i might give you $500-1000, but then it's just because i'm writing it into the sales cost of the purchased vehicle. That broken car is going to the crusher.  Also you don't get tax savings. If you buy a car for $35k, and i offer you $20k for your trade, you pay tax on the difference. If you go out and do the extra work to sell your trade for $21.5k, you are losing money."

I think this proves my point... whether or not I have a trade in should NOT change the price of the car we're negotiating because I see them as two different deals, and that's why you get a better price selling your car at carmax (or private party) than trading it in."
askcarsales,3dajq4,mikec4986,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:40:30 2015 UTC,"as much as you may see it as two separate deals, it is not. We overallow for trades, and take money out of the profit on the sold vehicle. You can negotiate them separately, it will be the same $ amount, but the trade will not be nearly as good. Plus you're wasting our time and yours throwing it in at the last minute.  Edit: i'll ELI5 it for you. $15k purchase less $7k trade = $8k total. Negotiate the car to $14k, and i'll give you $6k for your trade (no overallowance), and its $8k total.  Feel free to sell your car on your own. Most of the time you'll get the same amount or less with tax advantages, or slightly more and it'll take up a ton of your time."
askcarsales,3dajq4,IronSlanginRed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:00:24 2015 UTC,"Because we want the process to go as quickly and smoothly as possible. Because many new car programs are dependant on whether you have a trade, and what type of trade you have. Because it makes a huge difference when we're working with someone's payment budget. Because it helps us to learn what you've been driving, what you liked and what you'd like to change about your car so we can help guide you to the best vehicle to suit your needs.  The only reason car buying has to be adversarial is because people keep making it adversarial. Withholding information in a negotiation is not negotiating in good faith, so if that's what you're doing you can fully expect to be treated accordingly in the future.  Take a cruise through the past threads in this sub and count how many people complain about dealerships withholding information then think to yourself why it's ok for customers to do the exact same thing."

I've gotten those every single time, and no, I didn't previously own that particular manufacturer. Correct me if I'm wrong, but every single new car buying advice starts with: Don't ever negotiate car prices based on monthly payment. Monthly payment could be easily calculated, and this should be done prior to even setting your foot into a dealership. I'm sure you love these types of customers, but this is the sinkhole every car buyer should avoid.    I think lot of you guys (salespeople) are living in a bubble... Public perception of you guys are not the greatest as you guys are the lease trusted profession along with politicians. Again, I don't want to attack you folks, and you're there to make a living, but car buying experience sucks."

Maybe they can't combine, maybe they don't apply. If you don't like the deal, you don't have to buy. I think most dealers will be hesitant to promise 1500 in rebates over the phone on some truecar thing and an email that they may have never seen."
askcarsales,3dc12q,kicane,0,Wed Jul 15 15:39:21 2015 UTC,Rebates generally do not hurt the dealer because they get reimbursed through the manufacturer. At least that's how I perceive it but I've only been in the industry a short time.

Supposedly that's $500 under invoice less any manufacturer incentives that I may or may not know about.    The price I was quoted last October without any program seemed lower than that, but it's hard to know what gets counted as a manufacturer incentive.     I guess that isn't the best price that I could get, but good enough that it isn't worth saving $300 or $500 by waiting for sales.  Probably just going to grab a Golf S w/ Sunroof (only way to get a manual 4-door), or TDI S pretty soon after they come out.  I lean towards wanting the TDI (could care less about a sunroof) but I only drive 10 miles each way at under highway speeds (40-50), so I'm worried about that being hard on the TDI."
askcarsales,3daaa1,Sail2525,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:10:31 2015 UTC,"-Yeah, it's a tough choice between the TDI and the 1.8T. They're both fantastic. If this was the MK5/6, the base gas engine was terrible. I hated the old 5 cylinder, but the new EA888 1.8T is unbelievably good. I think your commute is better suited to the gas engine and you will end up saving some money also. But you should be fine with the TDI. I drive my X5 diesel in the city as my DD (Boston.) Never any issues.  -I guess it all depends on what torque curve you enjoy more. They both feel zippy, but the diesel pulls harder at highway speeds, but technically the 1.8T is the faster car."

VW is typically a little late on the model year change-over. Usually late summer to early fall.  -The first way this could go is that you wait until the 16s come out and get a great deal on the leftover 15 models with cheap loan rates, but when it comes to selling it in a few years, you'll be screwed because the VW guys will be seeking out a 2016 for the CarPlay/Android Auto/larger screen MIB system  -You get a new 2016 Jetta in the early Fall, but you probably won't get 0% financing.   It's a tough choice, but I'm waiting for the new MIB2 system because the current NAV/screen set-up in the Jetta is one generation behind the MK7 Golf that just came out. It's the RNS310 NAV system and it's a pile of crap with an embarrassingly tiny screen. Same system from like 4 years ago."
askcarsales,3daaa1,chickentikka69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:39:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply and laying everything out. Are you going for a TSI or TDI?  I guess if I opt for the TDI S that wouldn't affect having carplay or not...unless it comes on the TDI S in the '16.

The TDI makes more sense if you take long trips and want the range. Other than that, I don't know what I'd do right now. Diesel is the same price as 87 in my area.  -Yeah, I'm not sure about which trims get it. The info on Vortex is all over the place. Some say CarPlay and Android Auto are on every trim, but others say it's SE and higher. We can't be sure for a few weeks when the order guides come out for the US"

askcarsales,3dastr,Shimasaki,18,Wed Jul 15 12:14:41 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing this a small not franchised lot. Not only is it not a reasonable request it raises several red flags, the first being is the dealer has cash flow issue which is a red flag because you will likely end up having problems getting the title of the car you are buying... stay away, buy a car else where, if they can't afford to pay off your car, then you can imagine where else they have cut corners with the cars on their lot."

askcarsales,3dastr,physical-horse,3,Tue Jul 14 21:10:21 2015 UTC,1 - trading for a 7 year older car is rarely a good move. 2 - what kinda dealer wouldn't pay out a loan and just roll in the negative equity? I deal with negative equity on a daily basis.  3 - Maintenance alone is going to bury you. This sounds really sketchy. This deal's got hair on it already. Please  don't do this.

With that in mind, this has shady written all over it. I know it's hard to drive a Fusion when you'd rather be driving a BMW. Pay off your fusion, drive it until the wheels fall off, and put away some money so that you can buy what you want in the future.

askcarsales,3dbjel,Crowing91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"As a Honda guy, I would take the Camry all day long. The SE is a really good car, Toyotas hold their value really well and TFS is pretty lenient in my experience. Their turn-in isn't as bad as you have been told and they are pretty lenient.

The seats are too soft and the ride is even more cushy than a Camry. The biggest issue with the Altima is the CVT too.  -The Camry SE will be better equipped than a base Altima S. The Altima S goes up against a Camry LE or CE (i'm not sure they make that anymore though)  -On the topic of the lease approvals, yes, I wouldn't be surprised if Toyota (and Honda) has stricter credit requirements than Nissan. Nissan (like Kia and Mitsubishi) seem to have pretty lax credit requirements for their cars and peddle their cars to a different customer. I'm sure a finance guy can attest to this here."

askcarsales,3d97wl,BigDoggie,-4,Tue Jul 14 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't.  If the dealership wants to find something to charge you for, they will find something to charge you for.  Whether you have the card or not.  One of my customers was buying a used vehicle from me and showed me on his vehicle (lease ending and was being returned) where the dealership was going to charge him.  He even pulled out the card and showed me it was supposed to be covered.  Ask yourself; If one of the items on the list of coverage happens to your vehicle, will you spend the money and fix it right away, or, would you leave it until your lease is up?"
askcarsales,3d97wl,TheRealMeatloaf,4,Tue Jul 14 16:11:23 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't. If the dealership wants to find something to charge you for, they will find something to charge you for. Whether you have the card or not.   Incorrect on two counts;   Dealerships don't do lease end inspections. They're farmed out by virtually all leasing companies to dedicated third party organization such as AutoVin or the like. The inspection report will be done and all charges/damages will be assessed a dollar amount. From there, the leasing company will forgive an amount according to your wear pass / XS Wear addendum (most commonly damage up to $3500, no single incident to exceed $1000, $50 deductible chargeable to customer).   For a 3 year lease, I'd personally be on the fence. But for a 4 year, 80,000 KM (or higher) lease? Absolutely, if only for the protection against low tire tread at lease return. After 80k you're almost certain to need to replace OEM tires, and who wants to go and install new tires on a lease return?"
askcarsales,3d7i4x,SleepyHolly,16,Tue Jul 14 03:03:11 2015 UTC,Nitrogen tires uh? Tell them to go suck a cock (politely) splash guards...maybe they will discount the car say $300 to make the deal happen?
askcarsales,3d7i4x,proROKexpat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"The OP didn't explain correctly, so here goes. The $199 isn't to put nitrogen in the tires. That's free. The $199 is a road hazard warranty that protects the tires. It's good for 3 years and warranties tire damage (even if you run over a nail or hit a pot hole and pop the thing)  Dealerships will repair or replace up to 4 tires in 3 years as a part of that warranty. At least, that's what mine does. It seems like a shocker of a cost, but one Honda Pilot tire is more than $199.. So I dunno. I'd keep it in the deal. I pop tires almost annually."
askcarsales,3d7i4x,physical-horse,5,Tue Jul 14 17:27:32 2015 UTC,"I've seen dealers charge for nitrogen fill ups as well as offer separate 3rd party tire / wheel warranties for around $200. Sounds like your dealer is the exception, not the rule."
askcarsales,3d7i4x,countrytime,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"Guess they can't all be honest.. hah  It is a third party warranty. But the company we use is really easy to deal with - we swap the customers tire, don't even ask questions, and the third party reimburses us a day later.   People need to be very careful about this nitrogen thing - at my dealership, it's worth every penny, but from what you're telling me, other guys can't say the same. Very good to know!"
askcarsales,3d7i4x,physical-horse,3,Tue Jul 14 18:09:43 2015 UTC,"The $199 is a road hazard warranty that protects the tires.   OP didn't specify that, so unless it's explicitly stated, we have only to assume this is a charge for a nitrogen fill-up, not a road hazard warranty."
askcarsales,3d7i4x,TheRealMeatloaf,2,Tue Jul 14 18:38:54 2015 UTC,Right.  All I have is what I've copy and pasted.
askcarsales,3d7i4x,countrytime,12,Tue Jul 14 23:14:36 2015 UTC,Tell them to fuck off on the nitrogen and see if they will budge about the splash guards and shit.

askcarsales,3d7i4x,fightinscot,3,Tue Jul 14 14:52:07 2015 UTC,"So the $359 for the protection package is close to cost. It comes with the trunk tray, splash guards, and wheel locks. $199 for nitrogen in the tires is a little ridiculous. We don't add that to our vehicles,  so I can't comment on what a fair price is. If you don't want to pay for the protection package,  I would ask them to remove the wheel locks and the trunk tray. The splash guards are drilled onto the vehicle, so we normally won't remove those. I'd tell them to kick rocks on the nitrogen in the tires and keep the protection package. That's a really good price on the 2016 Pilot and way more than we are discounting them right now."

askcarsales,3d7i4x,carmicdy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:17:42 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I'd keep the protection package and kick the nitrogen out the deal. We haven't been discounting pilots much at all.

askcarsales,3d7i4x,Cyndershade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:50:57 2015 UTC,I mean... did they really take it off or just forcing you to basically buy the extra stuff?  Can't tell.
askcarsales,3d7i4x,Sadukar09,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:16:19 2015 UTC,Ehh the pro pack still costs them money even if the nitro doesn't. They still took close to 500 off. More than I would.

askcarsales,3d7i4x,TheRealMeatloaf,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:36:21 2015 UTC,"Direct nitro gas has a couple of perks, namely that the gas itself is more resistant to fluctuations in temperature, so you don't have to deal with TPMS malfunctions if it drops below freezing. There's some other stuff as well, but in my opinion it's kind of psuedoscience, nothing has really been proven so I don't mark it down as fact.   Gas fluctuation is important to me though, I live in a place where it's below zero for easily 10% of the year, and I don't want to fill up my tires every other day."
askcarsales,3d7i4x,Starkeshia,2,Tue Jul 14 19:41:20 2015 UTC,78% Nitrogen vs. 95% purity Nitrogen isn't going to make a huge amount of difference.
askcarsales,3d7i4x,10splaya22,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it makes a world of difference. I can either fill my Blizzaks in September and be fine with them until February, or fill with air and have to reflate once every two weeks."
askcarsales,3d7i4x,Consumption1,6,Tue Jul 14 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"Something like 65% of the volume in our air is nitrogen, so they're charging for snake oil. Besides, almost guaranteed when you top off your tires you'll use regular comprised air anyways.  Wheel locks are a good thing and I don't know a dealer that sells cars with alloys that doesn't install wheel locks.  As for the rest, tell them to keep their cargo tray and suck their magic nitrogen back out of your tires and replace it with regular air and let you out the door for $40,200."

askcarsales,3d7i4x,mvs5191,2,Tue Jul 14 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"From Consumer Reports:  Consumer Reports wanted to find out if nitrogen is worth the price, so we purchased a Nitrogen Inflation System and checked out how well the inflation held up over a one year period. We evaluated pairs of 31 tire models of H- and V-speed rated, all-season tires. We filled one tire per model with air and the other with nitrogen. The test was quite simple: fill and set the inflation pressure at room temperature to 30 psi (pounds per square inch); set the tire outdoors for one year; and then recheck the inflation pressure at room temperature after a one year period.  The tires were filled and deflated three times with nitrogen to purge the air out of the tire cavity. We also used an oxygen analyzer to be sure we had 95-percent nitrogen purity in the tire--the claimed purity limit of our nitrogen system, which generates nitrogen gas from ambient air.  We conducted a year-long test of the effects of nitrogen in tires and the results show nitrogen does reduce pressure loss over time, but the reduction is only a 1.3 psi difference from air-filled tires. The average loss of air-filled tires was just 3.5 psi from the initial 30 pressure setting. Nitrogen-filled tires lost an average of 2.2 psi from the initial 30 psi setting. More important, all tires lost pressure regardless of the inflation medium, so consumers should check their tires' air pressure routinely. If you decide to have your tires filled with nitrogen, be sure to have them refilled with nitrogen routinely. Like air, nitrogen filled tire pressure will drop as seasonal temperatures fall. No evaluation was done to assess the aging claim."
askcarsales,3d7i4x,armoured_wankball,5,Tue Jul 14 19:44:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go as far as saying nitrogen is snake oil. In certain circumstances it has benefits. But the fact that they want to charge upwards of $200 for it is highway robbery. Costco does it for free. The absolute max anyone should pay for nitro is $5 per tire.
askcarsales,3d7i4x,ChuckinTucson,3,Tue Jul 14 05:48:13 2015 UTC,"The benefits aren't worth $5. Air is already mostly nitrogen. I feel sorry for people who pay that much for it and act like it's going to make their car perform better. Everyone should be checking the pressures in their tires every couples weeks anyways.   For that $20 you saved, you can buy a cheap 12v compressor and do it yourself."
askcarsales,3d7i4x,TheRealMeatloaf,6,Tue Jul 14 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"Yo, I got like an extra 10HP from a full nitro fill on my tires."

askcarsales,3d7i4x,TheRealMeatloaf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:42:15 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Only reason I asked is because a friend has a Mercedes CLS that kept on getting the TPMS warning light.  The dealership put nitrogen in the tires and the warning light hasn't been on since.
askcarsales,3d7i4x,landwalker1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:23:49 2015 UTC,"Again, anecdotal. There are a million factors at play. Why was the TPMS light coming on? Slow leak? Stuck valve stem? Nail in the tire? Monitor failure? System failure?"

Ultimately they said they could give me the package for $350 extra but I walked on principle. They were nice enough to throw In the nitrogen for free lol. It still was a good deal, but I didn't appreciate what I felt was dishonest at best.   I can get wheel locks from Amazon for under $50 and don't really know why a civic needs splash guards.

Out of curiosity, were you requesting a quote on a specific vehicle, had you specified the colour, and had the person giving you the quote specified a specific vehicle?  Dealerships often have vehicles in inventory displaying accessories because, quite frankly, that's the only effective way to showcase them, and will usually either find another car of the same trim/options if you don't want the accessories or sell the car with the accessories for a bargain because they've sold so many accessory packages off of the display car, they're no longer looking to profit off those display parts.  If that was the case, I'd hate to see you walk away from a great deal on principal.  Also, out of curiosity, was the final drive off price for the accessorized, in stock unit higher, lower, or the same as your next lowest quote?"
askcarsales,3d7i4x,jayendo,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"They were aware of the color I wanted and they only had one in that color. Honda dealers seem to install the same protection package on all their vehicles as soon as they arrive on the lot. However., since every Honda dealer talks out their ass, I'm not sure what's fair with tint, wheel locks, etc.   The total with the options was about $400 more than my next lowest quote, however, that dealer came back today saying it would be 1,400 more for the same package through them. I laughed and told them no. He than said he could lower it to just $850 more than their quote and again I said no. I don't understand why they can't be honest about a drive off quote.   There don't seem to be any civics on dealer lots without this package so the argument that the quote is without the package doesn't hold any water. They are purposefully giving low offers to get people on the lot.   With that said, it looks like the first place might be the best. I got one dealer saying they can match the first quote, but I don't believe them. I'm pushing for it in writing that they have a vehicle on the lot they can let go at that price."

You're not going to like my answer, but it's because of buyers like you.  You take written (or e-mailed) quotes and shop them against other dealers, asking them to beat the number. So the only thing accomplished by giving you the honest to goodness quote is to have you take it down the street to the next guy to beat by $100.  It's a game, the rules have been long established and this is what happens when people choose to do business via the e-mail multiple dealers method.  You'll notice that most of the advice in this sub centers around finding out what the average actual retail sale price of the vehicle is and going to your local neighborhood dealership (or whomever gives you the best service) and buying from there, hassle free.  It would eliminate this entire run-around and all the frustration you're causing feeling."

askcarsales,3d7i4x,TheRealMeatloaf,0,Tue Jul 14 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't start shopping quotes around until I realized the quotes I was getting didn't mean a thing. They are all telling me what I want to hear to get me through the door and I'm not buying a car that way. My 2004 civic still runs, so I'm not in need of a car, I just really want to upgrade.  As if to prove the point, I had one dealer state, ""I can price match their offer."" When I asked for the VIN of the vehicle they could let go at that price I get something along the lines of, ""Come in... I good... You can trust me..."" That is not an exaggeration. When I told him I needed the VIN and confirmation they had a vehicle for that price before coming down, I got silence.   Every single one has packages lumped in and it's bullshit. If they were just willing to sell me the EX as they get it from the factory, we could most likely come to a deal. Instead, they insist on charging for nitrogen, tint, etc."
askcarsales,3d7i4x,landwalker1,2,Tue Jul 14 21:58:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't start shopping quotes around until I realized the quotes I was getting didn't mean a thing.   This is circular logic. You started by soliciting multiple quotes, but not before you solicited multiple quotes."
askcarsales,3d7i4x,Nickamin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:00:28 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I misunderstood what shopping quotes meant. Yes, I was looking for the lowest, but wasn't asking others to beat the lowest.  All the dealerships I solicited multiple quotes from are part of the American Expresses Truecar thing. If they have an issue with this type of process, they should not be a part of something like that."
askcarsales,3d7i4x,jayendo,2,Tue Jul 14 22:19:01 2015 UTC,"That's because true car is supposed to take the back and forth haggling element out of the buying process, but here you are putting it right back in.  Why can't you just walk into a store with a true car certificate and say ""I'd like one of these in Purple Mica Gold please.""??!?"
askcarsales,3d7i4x,landwalker1,0,Tue Jul 14 23:34:35 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I did and they told me that car doesn't exist because they add options to everything.
askcarsales,3d7i4x,TyGreeny,3,Wed Jul 15 00:17:08 2015 UTC,That's when you go back to Truecar and select the options tab and check every option thats in the car and get your updated truecar quote.
askcarsales,3d7i4x,carmicdy,0,Wed Jul 15 06:24:41 2015 UTC,"With that said, it looks like the first place might be the best. I got one dealer saying they can match the first quote,    So how much time and money have you wasted playing your email game when you could have just bought from the first dealer?"
askcarsales,3d7i4x,Sternreisender,2,Tue Jul 14 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"I've only spent a few bucks in gas and the time doesn't bother me. I actually went up to that dealership to see the color I selected. I hadn't seen it in person yet. While looking, a salesman came out and I told him I was talking to X. X apparently went on vacation in the middle of the day, so he talked to the ""manager"" to see if they could honor their own quote. This is my first big ticket purchase as an adult, so I'm using it as a learning experience. Time isn't important since I figure everything I learn from this experience will help the next time we have to buy cars, a house, etc."
askcarsales,3d9lj1,HandsomeBobBob,2,Tue Jul 14 15:58:16 2015 UTC,Shouldn't be any changed other than maybe some of the tech being introduced to the '16 Pilots. Expect end of summer maybe Fall if I remember.
askcarsales,3d9lj1,carmicdy,2,Tue Jul 14 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"We should see them sometime in the late summer/early fall.  There will be no difference in aesthetics other than some inside tech that may get upgraded like they did on the 2016 Pilot and the HR-V.  The redesigned Odyssey will most likely be the 2017.  Regardless of the style or body changes, the Odyssey will hold its value quite well.  I would take a 2015 over a 2016 because you will have more incentives on that model year."
askcarsales,3d76s1,aelder,9,Tue Jul 14 01:32:41 2015 UTC,"Dealers buy at wholesale and sell at retail. Trading is nice for you because its easy but you'll never get the most money trading in. You lucked out because it was a Cayman - easily the hottest used car on the planet. If it was a Honda Civic or something you'd still be sitting on it dealing with losers, lowballers, and people wanting to trade you a combine or something."
askcarsales,3d76s1,rodion_kjd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:52:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see what you're saying. I have no grudge about it, I knew I'd get lower offers. I suppose what seems strange to me is how firm they were at the 21k level.  If I was in sales, I think I would have been frustrated to have my hands tied by their appraiser at that level.  If I wasn't so much an introvert I would really enjoy selling cars. This post is just curiosity at how firm the tradein price point seemed to be across dealerships."
askcarsales,3d76s1,proROKexpat,3,Tue Jul 14 02:06:49 2015 UTC,"Its a risk to them, they factored in that risk.If something is wrong on a Porsche its fucking expensive to fix. Plus you sold it for 26k I bet a dealer would get a similirish amount maybe 1k more...maybe 2k. That leaves 5-7k in profit sounds like a lot right?  Well no because there no guarantee they will get that, they have staff to pay, and I would imagine they would have to put at least $1,000 into it to sell.  Sometimes a dealer doesn't want your car. Example I was dealing with a 2002 Ford Explorer 2WD XLT  (this was in 2009) my used car guy was like ""Its not 4WD, its not in the best shape, and I got 7 of those bitches on my lot right now I don't need one, I don't wanna make an offer""  Lady wanted he offer, he said he'd pay her $500 for it. Lady got pissed and stormed off...he didn't really want the truck. So if he could steal it...sure he'll take it if not fuck it."
askcarsales,3d76s1,Way2evil,2,Tue Jul 14 02:37:31 2015 UTC,How much over 500 dollars was she expecting to get for her 300 dollar truck?

askcarsales,3d76s1,agreathobo,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:12:55 2015 UTC,"I was expecting CarMax to give you a way below offer because of the retail-ish way that they work, seriously surprised they beat the other dealers. I know a car blogger took his Ferrari 360 Modena in and they low balled the mess out of him."
askcarsales,3d76s1,DieMrDiamond,4,Tue Jul 14 04:08:21 2015 UTC,"Carmax is actually pretty competitive on imports non-exotic down in Texas. I know quite a few dealers that use them to bid cars in that they wouldn't want for their own lots. It's a large chain though, I'm sure they are completely different in the Northeast and California."
askcarsales,3d76s1,hesbunky,4,Tue Jul 14 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"Not really sure what you're basing this on...an exotic trade being lowballed by a large retail volume dealer? Carmax consistently pays more for used cars than anyone else. If I'm bidding against them on simulcast or another auction I'll just give up if they're the only ones I'm against, because they pay a ton for their trades/buys."
askcarsales,3d76s1,Starkeshia,3,Tue Jul 14 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"the retail-ish way that they work   What does that even mean?   I know a car blogger took his Ferrari 360 Modena in and they low balled the mess out of him.    That makes a lot of sense to me.    Carmax can't retail a Ferrari on their lot, so they're going to auction it.  Keep in mind that they run their own auctions.    Most of what they auction is wrecked/high mileage/old, so nearly all of the bidders they attract are looking for cheap stuff.  Ferraris are the opposite of cheap.  They run a Ferrari through auction in front of a bunch of cheap bidders who aren't looking for an Italian exotic then the only bids they're going to get are from folks that know they can flip it quick for a sure fire profits.  That means low bids.  That means a low offer."
askcarsales,3d76s1,ChuckinTucson,2,Tue Jul 14 13:32:50 2015 UTC,Are you talking about Doug DeMuro?  He has fucked CarMax so hard on the Range Rover he bought from them.
askcarsales,3d6lcz,Patricki,7,Mon Jul 13 22:43:59 2015 UTC,"My GSM joked once shortly after I started selling cars and after hearing about my DUI ""Maybe you're gonna be a real salesman after all!"" So no, those conditions wouldn't preclude you from my store. Every location will be different, however.

askcarsales,3d6lcz,shamwow62,2,Tue Jul 14 00:03:21 2015 UTC,So a lot of your sales people do have DUIs?  How does that affect their ability to do their job properly? Many here have told me that a DUI makes it difficult/impossible to insure the salesperson. Does your shop operate in a way that mitigates the insurance burden?
askcarsales,3d6lcz,3031983,3,Tue Jul 14 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"I know a dealership where most of salesmen have DUI's. They are not allowed to drive company cars, so they just let customers test-drive cars by themselves. The place is fucked up in all kinds of ways.   At my dealership - there is no way you would get hired with a DUI. We drug-test, and if you even scratch a company car - you are suspended immediately until you pass a drug test again."

Used car loan rates aren't as good as new car loans either. It might end up being a wash. I just looked at Truecar for a S4 Prem+ automatic, B&O audio and it came out to $49k brand new. The extra coin is worth it to get a showroom fresh car. The only way I would get a used car is a CPO and get the longer warranty, but this car isn't CPO either."

askcarsales,3d6swu,Beerboy24,3,Tue Jul 14 00:03:09 2015 UTC,Most of the time. Like right now Ford is offering 0% for 72 months or a $1500 rebate on the Explorer. The subvened rates are almost always tied to losing a rebate.
askcarsales,3d6swu,focus_st23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:17:25 2015 UTC,Which one would be the better deal? I've seen this alot lately. 0% always seems like the way to go

Say rebate is 2 grand and you can get a 1.9% loan on your own based on your credit, than that would be the better deal than taking the 0% and losing the rebate IMO."

askcarsales,3d6swu,rld14,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:17:29 2015 UTC,Almost certainly.  Truecar pricing (At least in my area) Assumes you're taking every possible rebate including college grad and military.  It's one of the many reasons we don't use TrueCar.

askcarsales,3d7zwb,verdegrrl,2,Tue Jul 14 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"Have you seen and test driven these cars yet? Every used car has had a different life and the lower miles car could be rougher than the one with more miles. It's nothing like buying a new car.  Sounds like they aren't willing to lose over $1K to sell you the car, so they would rather auction them where the losses are likely smaller. You need to decide if that is in your budget or wait and keep looking."

askcarsales,3d7zwb,verdegrrl,2,Tue Jul 14 17:26:15 2015 UTC,No dealer is going to give you their bottom dollar until you're there in person ready to buy.

I've haggled over the phone/email for awhile and got them down a bit.  We've both said that I wouldn't drive out until we found a price I found comfortable with and agreed upon-  Even after this fact do you think I should still try to negotiate more in person?  What kind of reasons could I have for asking for less?  Would walking away be a worthy tactic at that point?  Thank you."

You might find upon getting there that this car is not for you (looks better in pics, drives differently, etc). Or you might love it even more.   Even after this fact do you think I should still try to negotiate more in person?   All used cars have flaws. You can use this to get them down further. Unless they are big flaws though, you aren't going to get them to drop over $1K. And then do you really want a car with a $1K flaw?   Would walking away be a worthy tactic at that point?   Vastly over-rated tactic. If they haven't got $1K+ room to discount, you're out that car. Are you okay with continuing the search if the car is everything you want and they don't call you?  Have you read the used car buying FAQ in the sidebar? In a nutshell, the way to get them to drop the price is to show other similar cars selling for less, or to point out flaws in their car which might lead to a discount. Use autotempest.com to find same year/miles/equipment examples (preferably nearby) to get a baseline."

If someone wants to spend 5 minutes to help, then great, otherwise it's no big deal. But I don't see the point in snide comments that are contrary to what regularly goes on in this subreddit."
askcarsales,3d99lc,rld14,7,Tue Jul 14 15:26:16 2015 UTC,MMR Isn't a hard and fast number and access to it won't give most managers in this business the ability to appraise a trade.  You have an 06 Wrangler.  OK...  Miles? Trim? Condition? Accident or Paintwork history? Rust? Damage? Color? Location? Options?
askcarsales,3d99lc,TheRealMeatloaf,2,Tue Jul 14 15:31:12 2015 UTC,"One top or two? Soft or hard? What condition are they in? Transmission? Modifications or bone stock? Has it been offroaded? If so, how often and how hard?  Hmmm, maybe there's a reason that the market is all over the place for Wranglers?"
askcarsales,3d99lc,carmicdy,3,Tue Jul 14 16:25:38 2015 UTC,If you looked at requests for MMRs you'll see a lot more snide remarks.
askcarsales,3d99lc,savyur,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:48:13 2015 UTC,MMR is just another tool like KBB and NADA. The problem you have is Wranglers get great resale value and people will pay stupid money to get one. Even the trashed rusted ones can get decent money. If you want a used Wrangler you have to pay the premium.
askcarsales,3d99lc,savyur,0,Tue Jul 14 17:31:31 2015 UTC,Hilarious!! Wranglers do get stupid money.
askcarsales,3d99lc,brAbibi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:02:20 2015 UTC,14k - 20k depending on mileage and condition.

Lease is the only way I'd consider it - DO NOT BUY THIS CAR NEW. The battery ""issues"" have been addressed via a better warranty as well as a buy-in replacement program. However, the IIHS crash tests are piss-poor, range anxiety is still a real thing, and market interest is near zero given the cost of fuel the past 12 months."
askcarsales,3d7id3,chandleya,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:10:32 2015 UTC,Lease a leaf.  The only way to go in my opinion.

askcarsales,3d7id3,cubical_hell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:26 2015 UTC,"The best way to shop is determine how many miles you need and ask for 1st payment down only quotes on cars equipped the way you want (always best to keep your cash in the bank on a lease. Don't put money down)  For example, if you build a leaf online the way you like, and ask for a quote, you should hear from your closest 3 dealers.   Say I'd like a lease quote for a 3 year 12k per year term. 1st payment only at signing. 2016 Leaf SV with Tech etc...    Get a few quotes. Choose the deal you like."
askcarsales,3d7id3,cubical_hell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:26:19 2015 UTC,I've heard it's best to nail down the full price of the car before letting the salesperson know I want to lease it. Would that still be there case here?
askcarsales,3d4jgj,okiejoe,5,Mon Jul 13 13:43:48 2015 UTC,All depends on the manufacturer.  When we put a vehicle in for a loaner we can't sell it for 8 months.  Tell them you love the truck and see what they can offer for a new one.
askcarsales,3d4jgj,half_glass,5,Mon Jul 13 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"Demo/loaner cars are locked into that status for a set amount of time or miles before they can be sold to a customer.

askcarsales,3d4jgj,savyur,3,Mon Jul 13 15:32:03 2015 UTC,Many dealerships advertise all their inventory on their website. They'll probably only sell it for whatever you can buy a brand new one for. There's likely zero advantage to buying this loaner at this point.

askcarsales,3d789o,aelder,2,Tue Jul 14 02:00:40 2015 UTC,And the funny thing is that no one really gets a deal at Subaru right now. Seems like there isn't much negotiating to do when they're as popular as they are right now.

There's hardly any markup in Subarus compared to other manufactures. Impreza or Crosstrek? Approx. 850$ Forester? Approx. 1500$. With such little markup the sales people have to fight for their gross.

Either way, having that safety net means you aren't busting your ass as hard as the guys who don't have when it's crunch time.  I guarantee you would work harder at the end of the month if you were a little behind and needed to sell a few more cars to make it over the hump because you didn't have anything to fall back on.  That's why it won't last."

askcarsales,3d4rmb,Lunchbox138,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:18:33 2015 UTC,"This is something that I guess you would take for the first month while you get used to it. If you can't handle straight commission without a ""safety net"" then it might not be the right job for you. Some dealerships have a decent ""draw"" check where you still make a base and then Whatever you make over your base is your commission. My last dealership did a $2500 draw and my new dealerships does $1500 so every place is different. If you can't make $2k with the 25% front then this job might not be right for you."
askcarsales,3d4rmb,Lunchbox138,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:17:05 2015 UTC,I really think I can and even though I didn't push a lot of volume in my first full month I held gross really well. I did the math if I would have been on the 25% I would have actually made more.

askcarsales,3d51n2,operationdone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:54:41 2015 UTC,"Just to tag on to the better place idea here.  Find a decent salesman who won't deny the currently known faults of their brand of vehicle. One that will openly discuss and compare other brands and options.   Talk to the guys in the service department. Ask them about any issues that may have been going on. Make friends with them.  Once you have good rapor with the dealership, you'll have a much easier time settling any and all issues you may have.  I don't even have to ask for a loaner anymore. I took my truck in for some work a few weeks ago, and before I even got to giving them my keys; they had a brand new caddy waiting at the door for me.  It pays to make friends, bud. Good luck!"

askcarsales,3d4i72,savyur,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"I am in VA so this is what I would do to help you. Maybe you can suggest the same.  The current title's reassignment is assigned to you. This must be voided. You cannot simply write void however. The dealership will write up a Letter of Correction. This is simple a piece of paper on dealership letterhead that states that you did not take ownership of the vehicle. Then the dealership will need to use the next reassigment and assign the car from them to your dad. The dealership will need to create a new bill of sale with your Dad's name. Everything on the bill of sale should match the current reassigment.  This thing happens every once in a while. Tax reasons, insurance reason, parents need control reasons.   IN order to get this done ASAP go in person to the dealership. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.   At first the dealer just needed to create a new bill of sale. Now they need to cancel the sale and recreate a new one. Not a huge pain but I can understand if it is not their main priority."
askcarsales,3d4i72,savyur,0,Mon Jul 13 20:09:49 2015 UTC,"sounds like where you bought the car from did not reassign the title to avoid paying fee's, the title has to be signed as it appears in the owners section.

askcarsales,3d4i72,dublbagn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:07:04 2015 UTC,What fees would this be? Taxes? Title Fees? The customer pays these even when financing a vehicle.  It sounds like the dealer put the wrong name in the seller section of either the title or the bill of sale. Does it matter which name they use? No as long as they use the same one for both. Dealerships can have multiple names/locations. Shit happens sometimes.

askcarsales,3d6jr1,loseit9788,6,Mon Jul 13 22:31:36 2015 UTC,So here's the thing.  Unfortunately slamming the dealership on the survey hurts only your sales consultant.  If you liked the guy you worked with and he did a good job you need to fill out a perfect survey for him - it can mean thousands of dollars to him in volume and CSI bonuses.  Your best bet will be to fill out the survey with all 10s and yes's (or whatever it is) and then use the comment section to tell them about the bad experience.  I'd then call Honda directly and complain to a district or area rep about the manager in particular.  In addition I'd leave a bad yelp/angie's list/whatever review mentioning the manager by name.  As for them doing something to your car down the line you're being crazy.  Service and sales are two separate departments that don't talk.
askcarsales,3d6jr1,rodion_kjd,4,Mon Jul 13 23:31:43 2015 UTC,exactly what I needed to know.. thank you sir!
askcarsales,3d6jr1,fightinscot,2,Mon Jul 13 23:35:45 2015 UTC,"DO NOT SLAM THE DEALERSHIP ON THE SURVEY WHEN IT COMES TO 0-5! I cannot stress this enough. There are a few questions that the salesperson is graded on which go towards what is called the SPI (sales person index). I WAS at 100 for the year and 99.6 for my entire career until someone misinterpreted the question and gave me a 4/5 because of something my manager did. There will be a comment section, do it there and mention the GM, not the sales consultant.   Then, try to reach out to Honda, the dealership owner group and then let loose on the GM on cars.com, Google, and anywhere else they have reviews for the dealer. Please, please, please do not give your sales person a bad score if he did his job to your satisfaction. This will more than likely harm his pay which can be a little or a lot depending on how his pay plan is structured. The previous bad survey will only effect a few dollars on my bonus, while his may be effected by hundreds of dollars.  Edit: As far as service, don't sweat it. They won't do anything to your car. We repair cars of customers who are huge pains in the ass all the time and their car receives the same level of care as our best customers. At my store, the sales and service guys are always talking back and forth and are somewhat close, but doing anything to a car or refusing service is just stupid and unethical and in someway probably illegal."

askcarsales,3d6jr1,tuck4x4,2,Tue Jul 14 21:46:10 2015 UTC,"As the other guys have said, the survey only affects the salesperson, and it affects him/her financially.  Even the score of random questions like ""how was the cleanliness of the bathrooms?"" only affects the salesperson (and yes, that's stupid).    The GM will only be affected by a complaint directly to corporate, and indirectly on social media.    But I doubt the guy was the GM; it's more likely that he was one of the sales managers"

askcarsales,3d5net,deegeese,2,Mon Jul 13 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"You have to realize that your order is going to a HUGE production plant where they're manufacturing a lot of vehicles. It's not as simple as just going into the computer and changing an order because you decided you wanted different seats. Your dealership probably spent a few hours on the phone calling their higher ups trying to adjust but once it gets sent and approved for production, that's pretty much it.   No, they didn't screw up. When you order a vehicle, you get one chance to build it exactly what you want. After it's submitted, it's pretty much out of the dealer's hands."

When I sell ""maintenance packages"" they are typically for pre paid oil changes, or cover all the things that are not covered(wear and tear items).

askcarsales,3d6ghp,elliottness101,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:47:29 2015 UTC,"The dealer rep is saying that the 'maintenance package' will cover ""regular maintenance items such as brakes, rotors and fluids"" with $0 deductible. The extended warranty (boot to bonnet) is seperate from the maintenance package and will cover ""repair or replacement of parts for manufacturer defect until 75k miles"" with a $50 deductible. All this is just verbal at this point and they haven't yet written the contract out. Once they write the contract (probably at the time of signing), I will look out for the specifics.

So the loan on the new car would be (assuming an 8k vehicle +1k fees) would be $16k.  Not only would this not lower your payments, most banks would not finance twice the value of the vehicle.

askcarsales,3d69ks,RexRaider,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:28:04 2015 UTC,I agree. There is not way you will be able to make this happen without massive payments. I would agree with the value there or about and if you want older then you are looking at adding MINIMUM 250/mo in negative equity payback over a 36 month period. Other thing to consider is a lot of those older trucks will probably have high mileage and be close to major maintenance so your ownership cost may be quite high compared to going newer.

askcarsales,3d4wun,vio212,2,Mon Jul 13 17:26:55 2015 UTC,Not necessarily a no go it just sounds like you aren't there yet.   I am in a very competitive Subaru market so pricing and availability is lower and higher respectively.  If this is there only WRX auto and they only get a few allotted expect to pay a bit more.  That pricing would be sticker price for the vehicle.  Money factors are higher for the 16 MY right now but it looks like you got a full bump in your lease rate.  If you keep the 3k down I would let them know you will pay in the 265-275 range and if they cant make that happen they either have a very small allocation of WRX (not likely as you can special order for each customer with no maximum) or they really don't want your business.   Keep in mind if you want to drive something that you like and makes you happy you will not care about paying full sticker or 30 bucks higher a month after you have the car 6 months.  I am a firm believer in paying for something you actually want to sit in everyday and not something lesser because you got a good deal on it.

askcarsales,3d2tcq,MangoHabanero,2,Mon Jul 13 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"The $925 is the cost Mercedes charges the dealer network for transport - shipping from the factory, all the trains, boats, and trucks involved in that.  It isn't going away.  I believe Mercedes offers ""rate lock"" which means you'll sign an agreement at the rates/programs available today.  If they're more advantageous to you in September when your car arrives great - they'll use those.  If the programs are worse no big deal because you're locked into July's figures.  I'd say 5% off a 2016, popular, brand new luxury vehicle is an extraordinary deal but I don't know what the Texas market supports.  Around here our Mercedes store won't even take 5% off an in-stock unit."
askcarsales,3d2tcq,rodion_kjd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:27:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! Unfortunately the July offer only applies to 2015 models. Do you think I would have any luck trying to get them to extend that to me for the '16?
askcarsales,3d2tcq,rodion_kjd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:02:09 2015 UTC,It isn't up to the dealership.  That incentive is put forth by Mercedes-Benz.  You could try calling them 1-800-367-6372 but I wouldn't get my hopes up.
askcarsales,3d2tcq,rodion_kjd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:03:49 2015 UTC,Okay great! Do you think financing through them vs elsewhere might be an incentive for them to give me the offer?
askcarsales,3d2tcq,cubical_hell,2,Mon Jul 13 16:14:53 2015 UTC,I doubt they will care very much.  If your credit is good they'll loan you money at 2% or less which doesn't amount to a particularly large profit.

askcarsales,3d2nkq,StyroCSS,2,Mon Jul 13 01:06:48 2015 UTC,See the used car FAQ in the sidebar here and in /r/cars. Use autotempest.com to help determine what other people are paying for similar trucks in your area.
askcarsales,3d2nkq,verdegrrl,-1,Mon Jul 13 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"Govt owned usually means very hard use and mediocre maintenance.  Basically the opposite of what you think.  This could have been used for any number of things but given the super low miles it was either stuffed somewhere and rarely used (maybe a good thing) or has idled for 10 years on security detail or something similar.  You can check the lifetime hour meter on the truck but it's a glitchy system and they occasionally reset for no (known) reason.  If it has 20,000-25,000 hours that should tell you to run.  If the hours are reasonable, then it's 50/50 and you should investigate from there.  A good mechanic inspection should tell you how it's been used.    You might also try googling the VIN.  Many govt sales are online auctions and some even tell you how/where the vehicle was used.    Personally I think the price is crazy unless it's absolutely mint and you can prove the low miles = little actual use.  Most likely I would recommend a well maintained vehicle even with 100k miles before this one."
askcarsales,3d2nkq,skinny8446,3,Mon Jul 13 12:35:03 2015 UTC,Disagree 100%. I'm selling a power plant new F 150's and he's trading in 7 low mile trucks (ex: 95 F150 with 30k and 00 3500 with 11k). The guy I'm dealing with has maintenance records for every truck going back to their birth. There's nothing wrong at all buying a fleet maintained truck. I'd prefer it because the guy taking care of the truck has his job on the line for how well they're maintained.
askcarsales,3d2nkq,3031983,3,Mon Jul 13 13:10:44 2015 UTC,"Some fleets are better than others.  Govt fleets in particular are notoriously hard on their vehicles with so/so maintenance.  I have over 250 units in my fleet and they're well maintained but some are used in very tough conditions that no amount of maintenance will really overcome.  Some are idled for hours each day so the engine related mechanicals have far more wear than the odo indicates.    More importantly, my point was that unless you can prove the vehicle has been used in a normal fashion and well cared for, the low mileage means squat.  Perform your due diligence to figure out if it's really a good deal or not."
askcarsales,3d2nkq,skinny8446,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:41:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for both of your replies. Great insight. I assumed good maintenance because my old work we used a Govt issued truck, and we took excellent care of it, so I guess I just assumed the same here."

askcarsales,3d2nkq,skinny8446,2,Mon Jul 13 14:45:12 2015 UTC,Well the VIN tells you the actual year.  Also the '01 and '06 look completely different.  Possible that's just a typo.  Any other good info on the GSA listing?
askcarsales,3d2nkq,skinny8446,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:58:49 2015 UTC,"Here's a link to the GSA listing,  http://gsaauctions.gov/gsaauctions/aucdsclnk?sl=91QSCI15038407  Can you tell if that's a 06 or 01? I'm pretty new to buying used, I've only ever owned one other vehicle that I bought new, really appreciate the help. Trying to do my best research here. It also says on the GSA ""REPAIRS REQUIRED BUT NOT LIMITED TO SCRATCHES, DENTS"" which I suppose could mean anything?"
askcarsales,3d2bvi,pewpnugz,2,Sun Jul 12 23:26:02 2015 UTC,With 720+ built up credit they'll offer you 3.9 for 60 and more than likely 4.9 if you decided on 72 months. I'm sure the finance department will drop it down more if you buy gap or some other insurance product.
askcarsales,3d2bvi,Lunchbox138,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks u/lunchbox138!   So am I right that about up to ~4.5% with $1000 off the price (pre-TTT) bringing it to $30,545 if I took toyota's financing, that I'm sitting about an even finance option between them and USAA @ %2.25 for $31,545?   Is 720 the ceiling on credit score lowering finance interest rate, or would they come down more since mine is higher than that? Or will they lower it at 48 months?"
askcarsales,3d2bvi,Lunchbox138,2,Mon Jul 13 19:41:46 2015 UTC,Realistically there is a good chance the finance manager will match the rate. I would have to double check but the military rebate may be contingent on financing with toyota (or maybe it's only the college grad). Also the  rebate is post tax and used as a form of down payment towards the car.
askcarsales,3d2bvi,Lunchbox138,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:49:28 2015 UTC,/u/lunchbox138 they were able to get their APR to 2.89% with $1000 military discount. That was definitely close enough to matching to take their financing option over USAA's @ 2.25%. Thanks for your help man - drove off the lot about an hour ago.

I find it odd and I'm skeptical but I have no idea how new inventory rolls in (do they clean out last year's models or sell them at much lower price, etc).  How does online purchasing work from a dealer? Do I pay the dealer and they place the order?"

Dealers can probably move these cars for near-MSRP. No need to discount. You might get a discount if you're a repeat buyer at that dealer or the dealer might throw you a bone for $500 off or something.  On a side note, good luck with the TT purchase.

I would put down $10k or $15k of my savings to blunt the downside of a deal like that, myself, but if you have thought this through and are comfortable with this obligation, and your CU is willing to lend you the money, go for it.   In answer to your direct question I think asking for $50k OTD is not unreasonable, but nor is ponying up $1k of your own to make things work."

I'm sorry to nit pick, but I come from an auto group where tires under what are considered safe are replaced, nothing touches the lot with a bulb out and I mean anything from outside to inside and every single car gets an oil change unless we have proof it happened within 500 miles of trade in."

The customer signs and dates this form indicating everything they've disclosed is completely true, to the best of their knowledge (ie, they're not required to know the full history of the vehicle before they owned it).  If a customer were to make a false declaration on this form, yes, the dealer could go after them legally, because a copy of this form, with personal information redacted, must be passed along with the vehicle all the way to its next retail owner (consumer).   Ergo, if the person trading in the car claimed the vehicle had never been under water but it was discovered to be flood damaged, the new buyer would sue the dealership he bought it from, who would in turn sue the dealership that sold it to him, who would in turn sue the client who traded the car in while making a false declaration.

Dont use a knife or anything stupid to rake it off, just try to use your finger nail a little on the edge to get it started, or maybe floss or something like someone suggested.   You will also need a can of glue gone since there will be quite a bit of residue left over. Dont worry it's safe on exterior car paint, and will dissolve the glue in seconds.

So we are paying for you to advertise, and then advertising for you.. right..let me get on that.   Most nice dealers will have the decal removed with a hair dryer and floss, or with some WD40  The first thing I did when I got my new Corvette was remove the stupid Chiclets and every dealership decal they stuck on. I watched them detail my car with a freaking bath-towel and scratch the hell out of one section of my hood (low volume of corvette sales at this dealership). I decided to tell them not to even try to remove the stickers at this point.  The last 3 new SUV's I had they all removed the stickers for me and gave me a black license plate frame to replace the dealership ones.

askcarsales,3cy8dn,treazon,3,Sat Jul 11 21:24:22 2015 UTC,Honestly you'll be better off putting the money you have in the warranty away for savings.  Set aside $50 a month for any unforeseen repairs.  VW's have a reputation for being expensive to repair compared to Japanese cars and this is true.  Do your scheduled maintenance when its supposed to be.  I have a 2012 VW golf and service intervals are every 10k miles.  Treat your car well and you'll easily make it to 100k miles with no hiccups.  Treat your car like shit and get ready to pay down the line.    I think extended warranties are bullshit and the majority of users will never need them.
askcarsales,3cy8dn,smoogums,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:51:35 2015 UTC,"Really appreciate the response, I was planning on doing something similar.

askcarsales,3cy8dn,Quackledork,6,Sun Jul 12 19:09:40 2015 UTC,I say always take the warranty. Especially on a vw.   Gap probably isn't as important on a three year old car.   That's my two cents.
askcarsales,3cy8dn,Skibbityboof,2,Sat Jul 11 21:41:37 2015 UTC,"You would be significantly better off if you took that $40 extra a month and put it into a savings account. Not only would it accrue interest, but you could use the money for anything, not just car repairs."

askcarsales,3cy8dn,ddavtian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:15:03 2015 UTC,GAP is there to prevent you from paying the difference between your loan balance and the amount your insurance offers in the event of a total loss.  GAP is almost always bundled into your lease price.  You have to look at your cars value vs the amount you still have to pay to determine if GAP is needed.

You shouldn't have any concerns about owning it outside of the 5/60k warranty.   ""General wear and tear"", as you described it, is normal. If you must have a vehicle that's absent any blemishes after 2 years on the road, stop shopping CPO and just buy something brand new.   No, KBB is useless. Stop wasting your time believing that their guide pricing is relevant to negotiation. All that matters is your local market conditions. Can you find a comparable one for less money? Within 100-200 miles, how many other CPO'd 2013 Santa Fe Sport 2.4L 2wd's are there with about 35-40k miles and with the Technology Package?  Be honest here and be honest with the dealer- you aren't considering this car because it's the worst one in your local market. That would be very foolish. You've already been shopping around and can't find a better example for sale than this one. Right, or wrong?  If you can't provide a few actual comparable vehicles for sale nearby, which will justify lowering the price of this one, then the dealer has no reason to lower their asking price because they're already competitive with the local market. ""I don't want to/can't afford to pay that much"" is not an effective bargaining position."

Most likely they don't retail 10 year old cars there so it gets sold to a wholesaler. Wholesaler sells it to another dealer through an auto auction.

I've been at the same store now for over 10 years and have worked as a Sales Manager for the last 3.  Looking back I had a huge leg up on other new salespeople because I was already comfortable talking to customers. Some new salesmen tend to be petrified of people, I doubt you'd have that problem with the phone background.   Don't sell yourself short on the dealer you go to work for though. Try to find out what store is the best to work at, who has the least turnover and who pays the most.   If you want to make $10,000 on the floor in my automall you'd need to sell 40 cars @ Toyota and 20 cars at the Dodge store. Half the Fords purchased in my town are bought out of the area because they only want to make huge deals and walk people all the time. Chevy are similar to Ford and the owner is new to the brand and runs his store geared to sub prime customers when he's got a top tier brand. There are 2 Honda stores in 15 miles and they compete against each other all day long. Pick the right store, you might make a career out of it.  Sales experience without car sales experience is a huge plus. You don't have any bad habbits. I'm not even looking for a salesman right now but if I had a phone salesman apply, I'd probably pick him up.

Google the cars year, make model and add ""problems"" after it to see what some of the most common problems are and what they take to fix. That should give you an idea of how long the car will last and help with your yearly cost of ownership estimate.   Call your insurance company and ask them what the insurance cost is then call your DMV and find out what it will cost to register.  These aren't numbers we can estimate for you.

For a super clean unmodified car from a reputable dealer I would say 5 would be fair however if it was me I would weigh private sale options as I would imagine you could find one in the 35 to 4 mark there.  Tire condition, and history (assuming mechanically decent) would be my driving factors in a car deal for something of that age.

This will get even more silly when you decide you don't like that one in a few months.    I think your trade number of $21.5k sounds about right.  $5k hit for driving off the lot is typical.  There is no way to do this for only a $2k hit.  You paid $3k in tax/fees that are sunk and have nothing to do with the car value!!
askcarsales,3cvc79,ManlyDan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:15:24 2015 UTC,"I figured as much.  I knew the tax/fees were a lost cause but I thought maybe as the Fiesta is cheaper I would be able to offset some of that.  The worst part of all this is that logically the WRX is the better car and I know it to be true!  In terms of resale down the line, space, etc but car buying is a pretty emotional affair all around.

We focus on payment because MOST people - 90% or more - can't pay in cash so the payment actually does matter.  You need to keep everything in perspective, obviously, but a $12,000 discount on a $50,000 vehicle, while a PHENOMENAL deal, doesn't matter if you can only afford $300.00 per month. Some manufacturers have certain incentives tied to certain forms of payment so telling me you're ""paying cash"" might get you a $1,000 rebate you don't qualify for if you suddenly decide to finance or vice versa.  The overwhelming vast majority of people can't calculate a lease by hand and aren't doing a 1 pay lease therefore making negotiating ""the price"" of the car somewhat moot."

The only time I don't like when people don't want to discuss monthly payment are when they are shocked that a $20,000 car costs more than $200 a month for a purchase.  People can eliminate 99% of the leg work with a couple of clicks of the mouse and strokes of the key board.    Long story short, when it comes down to it, I don't care with whatever makes you comfortable enough to commit to purchasing a car from me.

Monthly payments rely on interest rates.  interest rates rely on credit and equity positions.  I can't negotiate either of those without additional info.  I can absolutely negotiate the price of my car and the price of your trade as long as those 2 items are in front of us.  Those are real numbers, and thus we're engaging in real negotiation.

I had one customer say ""I can afford $1,500 a month payment"" we worked up his 60 month contract came out to $965 he switched to a 36 month contract to his payment to where he wanted it.  How we got there, we first worked up his price of his car (total price, not looking at payments) ran his credit, got an APR, then figured out how long he wanted his contract to be."
askcarsales,3ctufq,proROKexpat,3,Sat Jul 11 03:00:00 2015 UTC,A good salesmen always negotiates to a customer needs/wants while trying to balance that with the need of the dealership to profit from the transaction.

Meaning if you tell me you can afford $400 a month, and I can get you in for $325 a month for 0% or something, I'll know that we can start talking about rolling accessories and other stuff into the payment.    It's been fancied up, but he wants to know your monthly budget to know how much extra they can charge you.   Look at what he is saying:   And the salesperson is happy because they made extra money, the F&I manager is happy because they made a bunch of money, etc..   He is stating outright, he doesn't care what you want. He wants to know much extra money he get from yousimply because it ""fits your budget.""   Whereas people that focus on the purchase price and terms of the loan and all those other factors tend to be a lot less likely to spend the extra $2500-$5000 on all those other products and services.   Re-read that...people who focus on the the purchase price and terms of the loan (the two most important aspects of car buying)  tend to be a lot less likely to spend the extra $2500-$5000 on all those other products and services (i.e., stuff they only added on because......why not).

Whereas people that focus on the purchase price and terms of the loan and all those other factors tend to be a lot less likely to spend the extra $2500-$5000 on all those other products and services.  So to answer your question from my personal standpoint - I'm happy to sell a car to anyone that wants to buy one. But I'm happier when I can make around 50% more commission on a deal because I'm working with a budget. But I sold a car this morning to a person who didn't care what the payment was, they wanted my demo on a 5 year term, period.   If you're coming across salespeople that get thrown off their game because you're taking control of the sale, they're not very strong salespeople. Find one that's been doing it for 20+ years and is good, and you'll be signing on the dotted line in no time!"
askcarsales,3ctufq,physical-horse,3,Fri Jul 10 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  I do see that in myself - Recently, I don't want to add thousands of dollars to the purchase price when I am in the office with the Finance manager.  But back when I concentrated on the payment I'd sure as heck sign up for some extra products or services."
askcarsales,3ctufq,TheRealMeatloaf,2,Fri Jul 10 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"I talk about the entire deal with a customer. I go so far as to educate them as to better ways to structure the deal (lease, finance, cash, one-payment lease, money down, no money down, etc.) to make sure they know the best options going in.  Now, that being said, I'm not going to discuss options that would be bad for them or for us, or options that would revolve around them not buying the car because hey, let's face it, I'm here to sell cars after all.  When discussing the whole deal, payment is a part of the transaction. It has to be. Like /u/rodion_kjd said, if you can get a massive discount off a car but the payment is way out of your budget, it's no longer a good deal.  I find that buyers tend to fit into one of five broad categories;   Total price buyer. Discount buyer. Interest rate buyer. Trade-value buyer. Payment buyer.   It's very seldom for customers to focus on more than one category (a 'holistic' buyer, if you will) so it often falls to the salesman to cover the rest of the aspects of the deal so the buyer will be fully informed."
askcarsales,3ctufq,-SoItGoes,2,Fri Jul 10 20:27:15 2015 UTC,"Some customers fixate on the sale price, and can't afford the vehicle at any deal - i.e they are wasting my time.   If you can afford what you're negotiating, then we can talk about whatever you'd like to."

askcarsales,3ctufq,Tumble85,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"You can totally focus on that, but keep in mind if you're shopping for a used vehicle, the best VALUE may be  a newer, more expensive vehicle that can also be financed for longer and keep your preferred payment.  Think about it - if you could have a 2012 certified pre-owned Corolla for the same price per month on a 2010 less-or-no-warrantied Sentra, which one do you think is the better VALUE to the consumer?"

askcarsales,3cto4h,Micosilver,-7,Fri Jul 10 18:49:51 2015 UTC,My theory is the dealership used their Capital One generated loan and not the one I brought into them.

What should I do?   You have those 2 options, or you hand them back the keys, get your down payment/trade back, and go buy a car elsewhere.  As /u/rodion_kjd said, CapOne is a bitch of a lender to work with.  Their ""pre approvals"" are a joke, and they are hard enough to work with that if a customer tells me they're buying with their own bank and it's Cap One, I usually am combative because we are NOT confident we'll get paid the proper amount.  I would suggest getting a pre-approval through a better lender like a local credit union or bank like PNC, Wells Fargo, JPM Chase, etc."

askcarsales,3cu1i5,Leo_Kru,4,Fri Jul 10 20:15:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of newer throttles and transmissions are adaptive. They default to economy mode if you don't drive aggressively, but if you drive it like you mean it for a little while, it may switch to a more aggressive program.  However, on regular economy/family cars, the throttle response is laggy and the revs hang for the sake of emissions."

Nope.   -For example, if you're ever messed with Porsche's models online, you know they offer so much customizability. My CA spent an hour after closing on a Sunday and went over the entire build sheet with me. I even offered to come back the next morning, but he was happy to stay. He knew the build-your-own down cold and every trim/color/option combo in his inventory off the top of his head to show me. This is the kind of experience that makes someone want to be a repeat buyer.   -It's fine for the customer to know a lot about the product.

If they know they have the only one around, or the ""best"" one around, they might not want to negotiate all that much.  There's one here in Toronto (on AutoTrader) with 44k for only $22980"
askcarsales,3ctcak,RexRaider,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:52:29 2015 UTC,There's a automatic at a used dealer in Saskatoon (I'm in regina) for $21000. The difference is it's a five door with a DSG tranny. Not sure if that is close enough to warrant them to move on their price. The other thing is the PST is paid for so anything out of province add 5% plus a safety.  I did a general search national wide and online it looks like 23000 is the going price (that's just the year search not very specific).

Second: The EX35 is one of my favorite Infinitis. It's basically a G35 made into a hatchback. The VQ 3.5l engine is powerful and has been around a long time.  They are great drivers, but there is minimal backseat room. This doesn't seem to be a problem for him.  It's a sporty engine, and as such fuel mileage isn't the most economical. I usually averaged around 12l-13l/100km on the last one I had, but I have a lead foot.  The only thing I'd say is make sure he's comfortable with checking his blind spot, heh."

askcarsales,3csuyl,applefuzz,2,Fri Jul 10 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe $1500-$2000 if you are lucky.  FCA really screws us with leftover Wranglers.  They NEVER give any incentive support, so there is usually no real financial reason to buy last years over this years.  Say the cars have the same sticker price of $25,000.  Invoice would be around $24,000 and holdback would be $750 (made up numbers but that's ok).  On the 2014 I would probably sell it for invoice minus holdback just to get it off my lot.  The 2015 I wouldn't discount much (maybe $500).  So in reality there is really only a $1250 advantage to go a year older."
askcarsales,3csuyl,smbrickner,2,Fri Jul 10 15:09:55 2015 UTC,Wranglers don't have much dealer markup and they have $0 manufacturer rebates. If the dealer will actually negotiate on Wranglers (depends on your local market conditions) you can probably get within $500 or so of the best deal on the 2014 and go home with a 2015. Unlike with some other cars from last year's model there are not thousands of dollars to be saved here.  Just buy whichever Jeep you like best.
askcarsales,3csu3y,ckernan2,11,Fri Jul 10 14:21:00 2015 UTC,"So you were $3,000 upside down on the Jeep, and now two years later you're $7,000 upside down on the Mazda?  Holy crap.  You better keep this one all the way until the end."
askcarsales,3csu3y,skinny8446,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:13:32 2015 UTC,"The Jeep was a poor purchase decision because my starter car, a Kia Rio, was falling apart and not worth the repair costs.  After having the Jeep for 30k miles, it had already gone into transmission errors, alignment issues, and electrical problems.  I had it in the shop 4 times (under warrant) before 30k miles, and I decided that I couldn't deal with it, so that was the reason for the negative equity on the first purchase.  I got the Mazda and got to refinance my Jeep purchase at 0.9% for 72 months, so it was economically not a terrible decision for me.    I'm not technically $7000 upside down on the Mazda - it's more from the compounded negative from the Jeep, and that's if you look at KBB value.  Either way, I just keep making payments with no problem now and don't mind the Mazda at all."
askcarsales,3csu3y,skinny8446,3,Fri Jul 10 17:32:18 2015 UTC,"Something is wrong with your numbers.  $27.5k for 72 months at 0.9% interest means you should only owe $18.5k today.    You sure the rate isn't 19%??  My math says at 19% interest you would owe almost exactly $21,400 today."
askcarsales,3csu3y,skinny8446,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"You mean 1.9%?  Yes, I just looked it up - thought it was 0.9%, but it's actually 1.9%.  Derp.    EDIT: Mazda original principal = $26,060.74.  Payment = $456.00.  Interest rate = 1.9%.  Term = 72 months."
askcarsales,3csu3y,skinny8446,3,Fri Jul 10 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"No, I meant 19%.  Which was based on your original numbers of $27.5k financed.  Now you're saying you originally financed $26k but the numbers still don't work.  $26k for 72 months at 1.9% = $383/month.  If your payment is $456 then some other number listed above is still wrong."

I don't have all my paperwork and receipts (plus this was 2 years ago), so I don't remember specifics.  Possible that the website is tracking the principle on the car, only?  Maybe the negative Jeep trade was thrown in on top affecting my payment but not reflected in my principle.  Seems the most logical explanation.  $30,000 for 72 months at 1.9% comes out to $441.20, so my guess is that's what was actually financed."
askcarsales,3csu3y,itz_working,4,Fri Jul 10 18:25:48 2015 UTC,"The trade wouldn't have been accounted for differently with the bank.  All they see is a total financed number.  In order to have a pmt of $456 at 1.9%, you would have had to finance $31k.  Something is completely off in the numbers:  Either the rate you think you're paying is off by a factor of 10,  the amount financed is off by thousands, or the current payoff number is far lower than what you originally stated."

They don't send the emails out unless they're trying to drum up business so they probably had a slow start to the month or they're off pace for the quarter, something like that.  So if you're thinking about moving into something new they're motivated.  Probably not ""eliminate all your negative equity"" motivated but still ready to do business.  Based on how you're described your situation you should probably just ignore it and move on with your life."

You ask any Tacoma BUYER what they paid for their truck, and they'll all say they got the dealer to go $9k off their asking price because it was way too high and they're expert negotiators.  You ask any salesperson and they'll say they never have to discount Tacomas more than $200-300 because they sell themselves and demand is insane for them.  What's the truth, then? Well that's where you find yourself, in a sea of lies.  The truth is that in many regions, Tacomas do indeed sell themselves and there is no incentive whatsoever to discount, even with prices far above TIV.  Some people get good discounts, but I've found in my personal experience and my experience here that people who claim to have hoodwinked dealers and gotten thousands off can never seem to provide a purchase agreement detailing their actual purchase price.  Unless you're looking at a Tacoma that's been on a dealer's lot forever, you're probably not going to get one for 3-5% over TIV.  The market sustains a high dealer retail value, it seems, and no matter how many online articles you read about what you SHOULD pay for a car, if the local market sustains a higher price then that's the price you'll pay."

Naturally there is a correlation between your success and time spent at the dealership but all work and no play make jack a dull boy.  Try to keep a balance.  Sometimes you will sacrifice your personal life for the job and sometimes you will do the opposite.

So far very reliable and maintenance is quite affordable. Power is adequate on the flats. Economy is respectable.   Mine's a 2011 and took a very long time to find. The first day I brought it to work the office was in an uproar trying to figure out whose it was. The parking lot is full of BMWs and Audis but the little wagon turns the most heads.

askcarsales,3cr9hn,planetcookieguy,2,Fri Jul 10 03:23:36 2015 UTC,"Gap in a nutshell:  You buy your car for $15,000, you drive it off the lot.  You suffer a total loss a year later (wrecked the car beyond repair), insurance says your car is worth $8,000, you still owe $12,000 to the lender.  You are responsible for that $4,000 that you owe the lender, even though your car is gone.  GAP covers the difference so you are not paying down your negative equity on a car that is sitting in a junkyard.  Its more so for a new car because they depreciate faster and are more expensive for the most part."

Doing some research on what other cars like this are going for in your area tells you what you should be shooting for. Use autotempest.com as an aggregator. Leverage by showing the dealer with the car you want, similar cars for less. If you have a pre-approval from the credit union, they have no angle there.   How much of a down payment would I have to give? How do I go about getting pre-approved by a Credit Union?   General rule of thumb is 10 to 20% down, but often the more you put down, the lower the interest rate. Go to your credit union in person and apply. You can often do it online, but answering questions is easier and faster in person.   Gap insurance covers the difference between what you owe, and the actual value of the vehicle. Used most often when you put down only a small amount or are buying a new car which depreciates sharply."

askcarsales,3cr3fv,pmo86,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:17:28 2015 UTC,Seems like an decent deal to me.  Price is in the ballpark for sure.  These are great cars with the only downside being mpg.  A luxury brand is almost always going to be more expensive to operate but there are not many really good AWD options in the non-luxury class so you have to pay to play.  Charger RT AWD and 6cyl Legacy are probably the only comparable non-lux choices.  The former probably won't be any less to operate than the G37 and the latter is not nearly as fun to drive but has a better AWD system.

If I wanted a hatchback 3 series, I'd get the 4 gran coupe, but if I wanted a wagon of sorts, I would get the 3 series wagon (especially the diesel) or X3. Both of those have more usable space IMO  The best part is the amount of choice that BMW offers. Kudos to them! 3, 3 wagon, 3GT, X3, 4GC, etc  I'm not really the target buyer for this though.

I want something fast, but I am fine with a sedan - the Charger is the next car I am considering b/c it has a V8 and if I go for a used 2014, I get AWD.  I love the hatchback of the 3 GT and I am more likely to find a used one than a 4 GC (and yes, I know Charger is neither of those, but I came from a Camaro SS - I'm a muscle car guy).  The wagon turns me off for some reason, likely b/c it is a wagon...but the hatch isnt so bad.

askcarsales,3coxox,TheRealMeatloaf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:55:27 2015 UTC,"its a good deal, but for me the rear view camera is a must have; especially in a car of that size. also if your previous car has a rear view camera and you've gotten used to it, it'll be very difficult to get used to not having one. having said that, there is a retro fit you can do, but it's not through the dealer. bimmertech is a great company that does all kinds of retrofits. here is a link to the rear view camera for that car. good luck. the GT is awesome mostly because of the insane amount of rear seat legroom it has. it's on par with the 7 series!  http://www.bimmer-tech.net/shop/bmw-f30-2012/park-assist-retrofits/rear-view-camera-retrofit"

askcarsales,3cropg,Fatso2027,5,Fri Jul 10 05:56:06 2015 UTC,refinance your loan and pay the car off sooner instead of wrapping yourself into another loan?
askcarsales,3cropg,brkdncr,3,Fri Jul 10 07:00:58 2015 UTC,"This isn't what you want to hear, but your best course of action is going to be to just suck it up and keep driving the car.  You owe more than it's worth. That means you're going to be in an even worse position on your next car.  Your credit is pretty bad. That means your interest rate is going to be sky high on your next car, putting you in a worse still position on your next car if you even get approved.  I don't know your financial situation and don't want to make unfair assumptions, but with only bringing home $2k a month you can't afford very much in terms of a car payment, can you? No matter what you buy, with your credit history and negative equity position, it's going to be extraordinarily difficult to find yourself a car for under $400/mo... if you can even get approved.  What you really should do is pay as much as you possibly can to bring the balance down as quickly as possible. The sooner you can reduce the amount you owe, the better. Paying off this loan is going to help your credit immensely. Trying to get out of this car and putting yourself in an even worse financial position isn't going to help with anything other than keeping you cooler when you drive your car."

You don't have to list it on craiglist, no test drives, no random people calling/driving your car, dealing with people flaking out on deals. You give them your old car, they give you a new one....for that service, the dealer low balls you, and flips the car, either on their lot or at auction.  That said...almost no one is going to buy that car for more than (I'd guess) $4,000. 5 accidents is a huge red flag...Frame damage is beyond a red flag...it's 10 red flags, a siren, and two lawyers saying ""please sign this waiver before you get in.""   Realistically, the only people buying that are: a repair shop that will use it for parts (all of those pieces are worth something; especially the engine tranmission seats, etc), some teenager who doesn't care about the rebuilt/salvage title, or a shady dealer/car flipper that is going to conceal all those repairs and sell it to some unsuspecting person.

askcarsales,3cp0po,itz_working,2,Thu Jul 9 19:10:31 2015 UTC,"He said it wasn't his first offer? His first offer was 2500?  Of course he can ask for more, it's a free world brah. People here are just letting him know that he's already getting all the wood for his trade in and that they most likely will be unable to go any further.   Trying to get him to negotiate the value of his massively fucked up car based off the retail value of other cars in the market that aren't massively fucked up (ie - doesn't have 5 accidents and frame damage) would be a weak negotiating strategy, IMO. But swing away if you'd like to OP. I agree that if you don't ask you don't get. The only caution I would give to OP is just keep your expectations realistic."
askcarsales,3cp0po,Tatsukun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"He edited that 45 minutes ago and my post was before that.  I'm not saying he should base his value off of cars that are not in accidents. I was simply stating that one major accident and 4 minor ones don't warrant a loss of over 5-6k on his car when selling a car that averages 8-9k in good condition. I was simply providing figures of what good condition cars are going for and what he should expect for his clearly frame damaged car. I never intended for the post to come off as ""hey you should tell them these cars are x amount so you should give me this muich""."

On 2015 models, the 3.8L V6 is RWD or AWD and the 5.0L is built in RWD only.   Don't expect to get a huge price drop on 2015's, though.

The UK Genesis actually comes with toys not found in the US model, namely surround view camera and the auto parking feature. These seem to be more a result of Hyundai merging the Genesis and Equus for that market though, and likely not a preview of what's about to come to the US.

askcarsales,3cqhgw,rodion_kjd,2,Fri Jul 10 13:26:38 2015 UTC,"This all depends on whether you're willing to put some money into the car as soon as you buy it.  That said:  Tires = $400 minimum  (if you get a good deal)  Brakes = $250 minimum (if done yourself, it's easy - 4 bolts, 1-2 wrenches, and a c-clamp - just Google year/make/model + brakes and you'll find a video on how to do it). $400-600 if done in a shop.  Clutch = $1200 - recently quoted this price by 3 different shops for my wife's car, this is not something you should attempt to fix.  You will probably want to put new shocks on it as well unless they've already been replaced = $400-600  V6 Hondas run on timing belts which last about 100k miles vs timing chains which are designed to last the life of the engine. Replacing the belt easily costs $700-1k. If this has already been changed then you're good there.  Bottom line: Do you feel this vehicle is worth putting close to $2k-2,500 or more into as soon as you buy it? If not, move along.   If you do pass on this, I highly recommend Nissans. I drove one oenginer 2.0 engine cars from 45k miles to 155k miles between '99-'07 (with literally zero repairs) and still see it driving around town - saw it two days ago.  edit: didn't read the linked post to see year/trim/engine"

People help friends/family sell cars all the time.  If you ask about this and get a story about why the sister can't be there, that is a red flag that you're dealing with a curbstoner. Curbstoning is a practice where people will buy shitty cars on the cheap, do a minimal amount of half-assed repair to them to make them presentable, and then sell them for a profit. They don't reassign the title from the previous owner to avoid paying taxes on it/registering as a dealer because they sell so many cars. It's not a scam exactly but it's kind of scummy, and the cars are almost always pieces of crap."

Look online for her phone number and call her, make sure she inows about the sale and that she's ok with it. Don't ask him for the phone number because if he is selling a stolen car or without her permission, he can give you the number to a friend that will pretend to be her.

askcarsales,3cp55s,Way2evil,0,Thu Jul 9 21:39:02 2015 UTC,"A bank draft or loan check are not certified funds. They are just normal checks that clear the way a check normally does. Of course they won't bounce as the bank is writing them but they are not considered certified.   As for your 10k remark, that is not true at all.

Probably even worse. The Benz GL is the only one out there that fits adults in the back.   -I saw the new Q7 back in April and sat in it.

askcarsales,3cpki0,skinny8446,3,Thu Jul 9 23:56:28 2015 UTC,"-Mercedes GL is awesome. If I ever had a bunch of kids, that's the car I'd buy. I'd skip the 450 and get the diesel. It's cheaper and will hold its value far better in the long run. It's also a size class above all of these cars you've looked at. Actual usable 3rd row. I'm 6ft and would be down for a long road trip in the back.  -Audi Q7 is nice (I had one of the first ones in the US back in 2006), but it's super dated now. New one is a few months away.  -Volvo XC90 is a worth a look. Interior is gorgeous. I really liked it, but I have an issue with the 4 banger engine. It doesn't belong in a luxury car, especially when the competition has such fantastic engines in their cars, such as the X5, Q7, etc.  -Out of the ones you ruled out, why not the X5?

When I went to a dealership here to just window shop I was asked why I wasn't ready to buy. I said I planned to buy in mississippi. With out missing a beat the sales man offered to take off the tax. I didn't even ask if he would barter and he knocked 2 grand off a car.   So if he's wiling to do that than perhaps another dealer would.   Do I really have to put up with people like you in this subreddit? You offered no help so why open your mouth. My primary question was about holding a car with a deposit.   Edit:Also by my math I could plan on asking for more than 500 off the car. The difference it 1000 if you factor in the radio.
askcarsales,3cq8k4,smoogums,3,Fri Jul 10 02:13:57 2015 UTC,I'm an an idiot user who doesn't sell cars.  Everyone else here with flair is super nice but you left out information from your post I'm not a mind reader.  Honestly dealers will not hold a used with a deposit.  The minute someone shows up ready to buy now they'll sell it.  I know because I found a cool civic I wanted to buy and was told I had to wait for it to get inspected before I could buy it as they had just gotten it from a trade in.  I made an appointment at opening to buy it at a agreed upon price and guess what some random guy saw the car an 30 mins before closing the day before my appointment and bought it.

It's easier than argueing with them and getting the run around.  I think you should just buy the car in California and drive it there. You'll save on airfare and you'll come out ahead."

Honestly it seems high to me because Honda almost always offers good incentives on civic leases and the money factor is usually super low.  But if your credit can't qualify, or the dealership isn't using Honda financials incentives for some reason it might be a great deal higher.  And as others have pointed out, taxes tags  and fees can make a big difference.  You can look up in your state what the first two should run, the third is set by the dealership and frequently inflated and acted like a point they can't negotiate on.  Look up what similar dealerships in your area charge in fees and don't overpay it.  Fees are mostly pure profit for the dealer, so if you hardball them you'll find they they'll eventually drop it down."
askcarsales,3cq44z,PolarPopJunky,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:16:42 2015 UTC,"By the way, try negotiating an out the door price at a dealership next time, meaning a price with taxes title and fees factored in already.  This gives the dealership way less room to fuck you on the details."
askcarsales,3cp5j3,CaptWinkie,6,Thu Jul 9 17:27:04 2015 UTC,"This may be a bit off topic, but why get a GTI with a DSG?  GTIs are super fun cars, and half the fun in them comes from the manual transmission. Also, make sure to check out the price of a 40k service on that DSG.   If you don't know how to drive a manual transmission, don't let that stop you. I'm of the opinion that anyone can learn to drive a manual with about an hour of practice."
askcarsales,3cp5j3,Consumption1,3,Thu Jul 9 19:56:53 2015 UTC,DSG still allows for a lot of control apparently and fun driving experience.
askcarsales,3cp5j3,smoogums,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"I have one. Yeah, it's not quite as fun, but it is still fun. In manual mode you have full control, minus the clutch pedal, but with the addition of rev-matching downshifts. Add in traffic, driveability for your SO or non-manual-driving friends, better gas mileage, faster 0-60, etc and it's a very good option for some people.   If your main concern is fun driving experience, I would honestly recommend considering the Fiesta/Focus ST first. If you want a more refined daily-driver sport hatch, the GTI w/DSG is great."
askcarsales,3cp5j3,juaquin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:46:17 2015 UTC,"I would get a manual but I heard good things about the DSG on the new GTIs and I like having the auto just for the fact that other people could drive it.    The comfort of having an auto is nice, especially if someone needed to move my car if its in the way somewhere or if we needed an emergency designated driver, I stay flexible with the auto. Thank you for the response tho!"
askcarsales,3cp5j3,itz_working,3,Thu Jul 9 21:14:43 2015 UTC,"If it was a WRX I would say sell it for market price, but since it's an Impreza it may take a bit longer to sell it. Don't bother with KBB for what your car is worth I would check out the major used car sites and see what they're being listed for and get an offer on it in that ballpark. This way you're just dealing with the finance guy instead of tire kickers and low ballers."
askcarsales,3cp5j3,itz_working,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:22:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm finally making the upgrade to an entry level sports car.

Do you think that GTI is a good deal? Thanks!"
askcarsales,3cp5j3,Beerboy24,3,Thu Jul 9 18:35:15 2015 UTC,The price doesn't seem too bad and there is always room for negotiation. Do not mention trade in until you have finalized the numbers on the GTI. Figure out what you owe on the Impreza as well before hand.  Do the same thing with the GTI that you did with the impreza and look up how much they're selling for to compare market price.

I'm I found the GTI on cargurus.com and it was selling for below market value compared to other similar trims, years and models of the GTI.

askcarsales,3cp5j3,juaquin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:12:46 2015 UTC,"You should tell them you are trading. Any good salesman will figure it out right away anyways, and you will waste a lot of time by not telling them up front."

askcarsales,3comnk,pjpjr6,2,Thu Jul 9 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"They don't need a credit app to do that. They may need your VIN, Ally account number and last 4 of your social to get your buy out."

As per your lease contract you are responsible for coming up with that $30k if you trade the lease in. Whether it's from a dealer giving you $30k or a dealer giving you $27k and you rolling $3k into the new loan, it is what it is.  Don't want to deal with that?

So imagine one day going on a test drive at a dealership (without ever dealing with truecar).  Truecar dealers are required by contract to give your info to them.  So now, a third party company you never dealt with has your address, phone number, etc."

askcarsales,3co6pn,falcon0159,2,Thu Jul 9 20:41:29 2015 UTC,I have a question - A few weeks ago I purchased a new car from a dealer not affiliated with Truecar.  Let's say they become a Truecar dealer today.  From what date does Truecar have access to the dealers sales info?  Does Truecar get access to historical sales data or does Truecar start obtaining sales data only from the day the dealer becomes part of their network?
askcarsales,3co6pn,ennagizer,2,Thu Jul 9 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"From what I've read on the terms:     c. DMS Sales Access. Subject to the confidentiality and use restrictions below, Dealer will provide access to Dealer’s Dealership Management System (“DMS“) sales data either through (i) direct extraction by TrueCar’s third-party DMS vendor(s) (such as DMI or VIN Plus/Netlink), (ii) manual transmission of data by Dealer to a TrueCar third-party DMS vendor, or (iii) other method mutually agreed upon by TrueCar and Dealer. Upon TrueCar’s request, Dealer will connect or reconnect TrueCar’s access to Dealer’s DMS sales data within two (2) business days of such request. Dealer represents, warrants, and covenants that it has all the necessary rights to provide the DMS sales data for use as specified in the Agreement.     DMS usually stores customer information indefinitely (I can access info from years ago on mine).  If they have access to the DMS in general, they'll have access to your info, even if it was in there before they became a dealer."

I have no idea what your backstory is here, or what you want to accomplish.  If you signed a 5 year loan for $20000 at 5% interest, you will pay $2645 in interest over the 5 years.

I'm pretty sure that's their purpose. Just make sure you keep it between the lines and hope there are no deer or crashed/stopped cars in the roadway.  They're also there for perceived value. We know that fogs signify a higher spec level; the fact they are there typically means you get more options.

Good fog lights will do a lot more than the OEM's in terms of seeing in foul weather.  While they're aimed low, they will still interfere with other drivers if you use them when they shouldn't be used.

But you will probably have to put money into it since the price you can sell it and your payoff are a few thousand a part.

askcarsales,3cn77l,RParasi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:23:26 2015 UTC,"Not a salesman, but I've driven both the regular and 'C' Priuses. The Prius C is significantly smaller inside and feels somewhat insubstantial on the road. Bumps can definitely make themselves felt in the cabin. But it has better outward visibility, fresher tech (though not in the 2014) and is of course cheaper.  There's not much in MPG between the two (you'll work the smaller engine harder in the C but it weighs less, etc.) so it comes down to size and price. For example, ask yourself: how often will you need the bigger cargo area in the Prius liftback?  One of the actual sales guys here will be able to tell you how the new vs. CPO warranties work out with Toyotas... you might actually come out somewhat ahead with a CPO. But Priuses are very reliable and have low maintenance costs so it might not matter to you.  For some mpg numbers: I got 47.5 mpg in the Prius C on a 200 mile road trip (90% highway). Commuting around I've gotten 48 mpg in the regular Prius, not much different on the freeway."
askcarsales,3cn77l,rednefed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:23:03 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that you're comparing apples to oranges. These aren't two cars that are similarly priced, they're two different trim levels of the same model that can't be compared. Compare pricing of the same exact cars with the same exact features to cars online and at other dealerships, and make your best educated decision based on that research.  It's like someone saying, ""the used Tundras are the same price as the new Tacomas. Which one should I buy?"" There are drastic differences."

I keep all cars and trucks I buy for many years beyond the final payment. Just as manufacturers keep the machines that are used to produce the goods they sell for years beyond the amortized life. In the case of cars keeping the oil changed every 3 k will mean mostly trouble free service for about 200,000 miles. Hold it, care for it, use it, that is best way to control money spent on transportation.  Keep your cash for the things that truly have long term meaning to you."

It's a great vehicle for what I need it for, no mechanical or cosmetic problems(a few age related scratches here or there, but A- condition overall), but I'm concerned and speculating that by the time my vehicle is paid off in March of 2018, the vehicle will effectively be worth nothing(less than $500USD Trade In Value) and even though I'll be putting a large down payment on a new vehicle, I've wasted 12k on a car that was a glorified beater to begin with."
askcarsales,3cn44x,aelder,4,Thu Jul 9 05:37:46 2015 UTC,"What I'm trying to say, is that depreciation isn't linear, it's a curve. It slows down significantly as the car ages. You've seen the worst of it now, your car will never depreciate like that again."
askcarsales,3cn44x,Micosilver,3,Thu Jul 9 05:45:18 2015 UTC,"As long as the condition is good and the car isn't trashed, the value of commuter cars doesn't really decline much past 2 or 3 thousand dollars. You quickly get into the range of people who need a car that runs reliably, any car. Either way, it should be worth around $500 just for scrap metal, so as long as it runs you'll never see less than $500."
askcarsales,3cn44x,TheRealMeatloaf,3,Thu Jul 9 05:41:44 2015 UTC,"If it is worth $4k now and $500 in three years - that's a pretty good deal, you will be paying about $100 per month in depreciation.   A new car will depreciate more in the same period."
askcarsales,3cn44x,hesbunky,4,Thu Jul 9 12:59:13 2015 UTC,"Right now your trade in is worth less than zero because you have a lot of negative equity. If you get $2500 for it but you owe $7500, then your trade in is worth -$5000 to you.  If you wait until you've paid it off to trade it, you'll get perhaps $200-500 but since you owe $0, your trade will be worth between $5200-5500 more than its worth today."

askcarsales,3ckt84,BeezyBaby42,6,Wed Jul 8 18:10:18 2015 UTC,"Well, OTD price is after everything. If your state gives sales tax credit, you're going to save money on taxes by trading in (you only pay tax on difference between new car and trade - if your state gives a credit). Logically it would make most sense to account for the trade in as well in the final quote. Just get on true car and get the price of the vehicle you're wanting to buy, and get educated on a ball park of what your trade is worth. I can tell you right off the bat you will not receive ""Excellent"" condition trade in on Kelley Blue Book. If the dealer lets you walk, it's the best they can do. Financing is up to you, just make sure you don't lose a rebate for taking 1.9%. Because if you can get 2.9% and lets hypothetically say a 1500 rebate a lot of times your payment will end up being lower. It's not complicated either way. If you finance through a C.U. the dealership will treat is if you were paying cash."

askcarsales,3ckrzr,BromanderData,2,Wed Jul 8 19:45:56 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up Subaru's remote starters are crap in my opinion.   The range on the smart-key one is very limited, and as soon as you open any door on the vehicle the engine will turn off. Also there is no way for it to turn on the rear defroster which is what activates the heated mirrors and windshield.  Subaru of America thankfully refunded me the price of the remote starter but I don't think I'd get a new car from Subaru with it ever again."

You could probably throw it on craigslist depending on rust and other issues and get $1000-$1500 with the stereo. Although the equipment cost you $1000 you cant recoup that money, think of it as a selling point for the vehicle now and leave it in. clean it up, take good pictures, and do some research on your local craigslist to see what similar vehicles are listed for. good luck!"

askcarsales,3cl4ey,goatshepard,3,Wed Jul 8 19:26:15 2015 UTC,"A few points   You are still paying interest on a lease, it's just called Money Factor instead of APR. Brand new Tiguans have 0% financing for 72 months right now, assuming your credit is solid. If you can get 0% financing, this will most likely pencil out better for you than a lease on a Tiguan with the 4motion (AWD system) as you should have solid resale value in 3 years on it if you live in an area with AWD is as important as your post indicates. However, your payments would be slightly higher per month. $2,500 down and $179 per month is not including tax, title, registration, dealer document fees, and possibly a few other things depending where you are. It's also on a base model (cloth seats, no sunroof, etc.) and the non 4motion version as you said.  Expect the 4motion upgrade alone to cost an extra $30-40/month (assuming they are willing to even take off the same amount as the national lease special advertises on what is probably a popular vehicle for them).    Not trying to rain on your parade, but expect to walk out with more like a $300/month payment, maybe $250/month if they are really nice on your trade. On a purchase, if you qualify for 0% and your trade is worth as much as you think, the payment would be more like $350/month, but you'd probably be able to resell the vehicle in 3 years for a few thousand more than you owe on it at that time. Basically paying $50/month for 36 months ($1800) for a few thousand in equity in 3 years."

The problem is, a lot of emails are form letters that get sent out all the time and they want you to come see it. If I had every single person who said, ""I want to buy it, I'll be coming in on xxx at xxx to see it."", I would sell 100 cars a month. They want you to come in and unfortunately sometimes people come in for cars that are still in service, body shop, clean up or whatever and can't be viewed right then an there, especially on a Sunday when 99% of dealer's service departments are closed. Fuck ups happen, I have done it a couple of times and done my best to let the people know when it was ready or if it sold.  If someone walked in the door Monday afternoon and the car was ready and said they would buy it, they don't care about anyone else who needs to go talk to their dad who will put a down payment and deposit. That car is sold right then and there. It sucks, but cars get sold out from people all the time.  He is blowing you off because the car you want doesn't exist anymore."

If you wait too long, the car/model/year/colour/trim that you are looking for might not be available.

If you have excellent credit 740 score and you are well established you should have no problem getting the rate, if you don't ask for that rate usually the dealer is not required to give it to you and you could face a higher rate, but most reputable dealers will acknowledge the 1.9% is available with approved credit."

They'll take the buyout money from you and process it and the title transfer as one transaction, and tax only has to be paid once. They may charge a couple hundred bucks worth of dealer fees to do this (the car technically goes into their inventory to accomplish this) but it'll cost you a lot less than paying tax twice.  Talk to a Jeep dealer and see if they'll be willing to help you.  Also, take a good close look at the numbers. It may be cheaper for you to just buy a used Grand Cherokee off a lot.

askcarsales,3ciwen,OfficeOrnament,2,Wed Jul 8 10:24:06 2015 UTC,"I am no expert on the Mazda3, but it does not look like a GT to me. Here in Ontario the rust on the vehicles in particular is the difference between retail and scrap metal.    Look out for Quebec registration, and also rental on the Carproof. They do not have to disclose legally if someone has owned it for 6 months I believe after it was a previous daily rental. Problem with this is that rental companies generally are self insured and accidents will not show up on the Carproof. Quebec accidents seem to slide through the cracks regularly and I've seen many Mazda3s come from Quebec.  Last but not least ask to have the vehicle inspected by your own mechanic before finalizing. Good luck."
askcarsales,3ciwen,BigDoggie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"While the Mazda 3 is a fantastic car (I owned an 04 for 6 years and have sold tons of them) I agree with u/OfficeOrnament that it's not a GT and that it's likely to rust.  2004-2006 were the main problem years.  07-09 models seem to hold up better and the model had a full redesign in 2010. The only part of that car that looks like it belongs to a GT are the seats which leads me to believe it's been wrecked and the seat airbags blew requiring new seats.  The GT front bumper and grill are different, the side mouldings aren't there and the wheels are wrong.  If it has a 2L engine with red lens tail lights it's a GX or GS, If it has clear lens tail lights and a 2.3L engine it's a GT.  My opinion is both are a do not buy."

I have actually just decided to move away from buying used car as all the private sellers I have come across seem shady as hell. I have decided to go to  dealers like Honda and Mitsubishi near my town. I have been eyeing this VW Jetta lately. All I want to know is if I am getting a good deal here. I am seeing the dealership in two days. Also can I negotiate?http://www.newmarketmitsubishi.ca/preowned/preownedvehicle.aspx?lng=2&m=2014-volkswagen-jetta&inv=p1236&id=e466bd64-09ba-4324-9e88-a4af003befcd

askcarsales,3cgdkp,BigHefty72,3,Tue Jul 7 22:31:10 2015 UTC,"I worked for a dealer who would wholesale hundreds of cars each week and have them available to retail as they came through.  We priced based off costs rather than them market so it wasn't uncommon to be thousands lower than anyone else for a comparable car.  The cars would usually hit the website a few days before arriving at the lot.  While they tried to buy cars in good condition, sometimes problems slip through.  Imagine you're a dealer and buy a Honda Pilot at a dealer auction because you can get a great deal on it.  You price it online, have it sent to your lot only to find out that it has a blown head gasket.  Would you go ahead and sell it to the guy who saw it online and came in?  Hell no.  That's more problems than profit.  You let them know of the problem and you offer your products that may be a good fit."

A used car will have SOME sort of problem for the most part, this one has a major flaw, but its listed at a low price (which brings people in), you should have assumed there was something wrong with it (or at least asked), if it was listed for substantially lower than others."

askcarsales,3cgdkp,Micosilver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"From FAQ's:   So when you contact the dealer – your goal is to make sure that the car is actually still there, that it is ready and not still going through service or body work, to confirm options that are important to you, and to make a solid appointment. You want to make sure that you are meeting with a specific sales person, and not just a generic appointment set by a call center agent, that you know who you are meeting, exact time, and that the car will be actually there. Statistically about half of appointments show up, so dealers don’t put a lot of faith in them, and they might not even bother checking that the car and the sales person is ready and available – you want to make sure your appointment is different. Confirm it one day before, and one hour before."
askcarsales,3cgdkp,rodion_kjd,3,Tue Jul 7 19:25:23 2015 UTC,"That isn't a bait and switch - the Pilot they advertised is there and available at the price they advertised it for.  You can drive (or, I guess tow) it home today.  They also didn't try to hide anything from you and told you why the price was so low.  This might stray slightly into the grey area of advertising but there's nothing illegal going on.  Buy it or don't.  They have plenty of perfectly fine Pilots in stock, apparently, if you don't want the blown head gasket one."

I've worked at the same store for over 10 years and frequented this sub before it took off from the AMA.  I'd say maybe 70% of the posts in this sub where a customer is accusing a dealer of trying to wrong them are bs and the customer is usually to blame.   In this case it's obvious the dealer is acting shady.

All the other pilots were cleaned up and actually on the lot.  Not in the back on the grass with a couple other cars that also appear to be shit.    There are 10 pictures for the pilot you went to see and about double that for all the other pilots.  Just look at the effort put in to each of the car ads.  The pilot you went to see was obviously an afterthought.  As far as the description, it is a template and you can probably find a few other cars with a similar description and the relevant year make model subbed in.  These things are EASY to point out in hindsight but, you can use them to help yourself out in the future as you look for cars."

askcarsales,3cgdkp,bangtime,-7,Tue Jul 7 20:18:22 2015 UTC,Not bait and switch. The vehicle is available. Their job is to sell cars and they assumed you were interested in buying one.

The salesperson will then show you a similar product that costs more. If you buy it, you may have fallen for one of the oldest con games around. You were baited by the ad and switched by the salesperson to a higher priced item   I agree it's a fringe case, because the car is broken. I just don't see any reason to not list it as broken on their website. The salesman even said it drives people to the lot.

Did they say it was in perfect mechanical condition?    If they conducted themselves in a wholly unprofessional manner throughout the entire process, and blatantly lied about the condition of the vehicle in order to lure you in.  Then go brigade on yelp, dealerrater, kbb reviews....  Here your effort is wasted, you are asking individuals who work in the car business and have witnessed a misunderstanding turn into a situation like this hundreds of times.  It was probably a misunderstanding and usually it is but, a car dealership rarely gets the benefit of the doubt.    Edit: if someone did in fact get you to come in and lied about the condition of the vehicle to do so, then bump it up the chain of command.

I did file a complaint with South Carolina Consumer Affairs, they can decide if I'm in the right or an idiot. I shouldn't have said the dealerships name in the title. The salesman on the phone was very pushy about getting me to set an appointment to come in, rather than just talking to me, so I got off the phone abruptly. A different salesman showed me the car and told me before we even walked over there the issue. He was courteous and professional, apologized for the misunderstanding, and tried to do his job. When I asked for some time, he found the guy I had talked to on the phone, who was extremely aggressive in person as well, even saying I had hung up on him earlier. I just left at that point. I did not ask about the condition of the car, assuming it was in good shape. I believed that most dealerships auctioned cars in that sort of condition, but found out that's not the case.

If you were just there for the stupidly cheap car you can buy it all day every day. But if you want something more you pay for it. Not a bait and switch. The car is there you can buy it.

askcarsales,3cj2v8,DIDIGETBUTTFUCKED,5,Wed Jul 8 08:29:06 2015 UTC,"Ok here is my take (I do financing among other things).  The Finance Manager should have called you when he got the turn down from Chase and gotten your permission before trying to get you bought.  However, if you were turned down 22 times you have some skeleton in your closet that you aren't disclosing.  Also just because you recieved 22 turn downs doesn't mean your bureau was run 22 times, it was probably run 13 times.  What happens is the F&I guy submits the app and it gets turned down.  So he changes something and it gets turned down again, so that means 2 letters are generated.  This is partly because the sales manager is/was being lazy and instead of calling and working it out over the phone with the analyst he just kept resubmitting the app with different parameters.  So yes he/she did wrong.  However there is something you aren't telling us.  Either you have something wrong with your credit, or the dealer is asking WAY too much for the car and the LTV is truly messed up."

askcarsales,3cj2v8,Way2evil,5,Wed Jul 8 09:00:58 2015 UTC,"A credit score in itself is not indicative of whether or not you qualify for a car loan. When a bank looks at your application they are looking more towards the history of your credit, to see if you've had any past experience with loans before, any current loans, delinquencies, etc. You could be a 750 and have one credit card and that could be the reason a bank declined you.   They also look at your debt to income ratio, so you could have a high credit score, low income, and still not qualify for the loan."
askcarsales,3cj2v8,Way2evil,0,Wed Jul 8 09:16:01 2015 UTC,"What doesn't make sense to me is I recently paid off my house  ($500,000) when I bought it about 2 years ago, which I would expect would help me in terms of getting an auto loan?  As for qualification. I did qualify and I'm guessing the reason they shotgunned my credit was because they didn't want to dish out the extra $1200 Chase counter-offered.. but in the end they did but I didn't want to deal with there shit anymore so I returned it. What also doesn't make sense is why they applied my sons credit to the creditors, if they knew he wasn't going to be ""accepted""..

If you were truly creditworthy to the bank, you would be approved. You're not.   Some information is missing.

askcarsales,3cj2v8,-SoItGoes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:45:26 2015 UTC,not necessarily. If he thought he had you approved and the bank ended up backing out then any other banks he had gotten you pre approved for would be sending you rejection letters because he did no follow up. Either you have a bad finance guy at the dealership or you have a skeleton we do not know about.
askcarsales,3cj2v8,Tatsukun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:44:45 2015 UTC,Both could be truthful and his son looks bad on the loan application.  This would also mean the finance department at the dealership he is working with complete shit.

askcarsales,3cj2v8,el_karacho,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:36:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting hostility from people in here.  You live in a state that allows a spot roll, meaning they can roll you in the car without an actual approval.  They probably ran your credit, saw you're strong and your son is a ghost (someone with no credit) and figured they'd get you done somewhere.  There is no rhyme or reason to banks approving or denying a co-x with a ghost.   Sometimes Ally will do that deal, sometimes it's Cap1. You just don't know...   Anywho, when you sign the credit app it lists all the lenders the dealer can send you to and there's a disclosure saying there may be more lenders not listed on the app.   It kinda sucks having your credit run that many times, I'm sure the finance guy or sales manager felt confident he could secure a loan for you.   Your credit score won't drop because of the inquiries. I know in California they count multiple inquiries that happened close together as 1 for this exact reason.   Unfortunately you don't have any recourse and you don't have a car.  Were you looking at a new or used vehicle? Something new with a rebate and a Captive lender (Dodge financed through Chrysler Capital) sounds like a deal all day long to me."

askcarsales,3cj2v8,Way2evil,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:57:09 2015 UTC,I had the same thing happen.  I was told it was because their credit card balances were too close to max.

askcarsales,3cfjxi,TheRealMeatloaf,6,Tue Jul 7 23:57:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks. I really thought my salesman and was a decent, upfront guy, but my brother and sister laid into me about how shitty car dealership employees are, and it kind of fucked with me head.    What do they do? Charitable work? Build orphanages overseas?  People all have opinions and as humans, we tend to look to things that re-enforce our pre-existing notions. They've got it in their head that dealerships are evil, you didn't get precisely what you wanted, made to order, ergo your dealership was evil.  The reality of it is, there are two times when you'll get the least control over vehicle selection;   New model launch. End of model year/cycle.   In the case of the former, the factory is re-tooling, struggling to meet demand of stocking up dealers, orders are all over the place, the supply chain hasn't yet figured out what the proper inventory mixes will be across all the hundreds of regions around the world where the car will be shipped and the early adopters will all be clamoring to be the first one on their block with the new toy.  In the case of the latter, incentives go up as supply dries up and with the factory no longer producing that model year vehicle, every hour of every day sees less and less choice in option packages, drive trains, transmissions and especially colour selection.  The good news is, many of the options you want can be up-fitted onto your vehicle. You can have after market (custom) leather installed (they'll even do armrests and door panels to make it look more natural), after market navigation is one of the most abundant areas of choice in the car market, and I find winter tires more valuable than AWD in the cold stuff, and you keep your all season tires longer and get better control and gas mileage.   Would trading-in and up in the next few years be something to consider then, or would that be bad business on my part? My Sky and AWD would be killer.    There may be merit to this. In years 2 and 3, most manufactuers will tweak the build and add new/better features, so you may be able to trade up and wind up in a better position than you'd have been today had you bought the jammed up 2015 model (2016?). There'll be a bit of negative equity, but that's the cost of buying two new cars within 3 years. :)"
askcarsales,3cfjxi,smbrickner,2,Tue Jul 7 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"Trading in is always an option, it is too early in the production to know how the resale will be though."
askcarsales,3cfjxi,skfoto,3,Tue Jul 7 15:34:30 2015 UTC,"Can you actually order them? Our local rep said we can only ""request"" them, meaning they'll try to line up one that most closely matches what we ordered but may not be 100% the same. He says they don't even get assigned to dealers until the ship arrives in port. So basically if you want an oddball option combination you're SOL."

askcarsales,3cfjxi,bangtime,5,Tue Jul 7 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"I'm going to start with, you probably weren't duped.  You should have done some research and looked at local/regional inventory before heading in to the dealership.  Supply varies region to region.  Considering the Renegade is a new offering this year, It wouldn't shock me that there weren't any available.  You can always look on autotrader, cars.com, even the manufacturer's websites can look up inventory for you.     I figured they wouldn't hesitate to sell me something more expensive if they could   Selling from in stock is preferable to trading with other dealers, so this isn't completely true.  I always get excited when a customer wants to look at the nicer models but, i'm more excited when I land a customer on an in stock vehicle."
askcarsales,3cfjxi,bangtime,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did some research, and I was really confused that they said they didn't have any available.

askcarsales,3cgiwd,EclecticEuTECHtic,3,Tue Jul 7 19:02:09 2015 UTC,Already $1400 below kbb.  If the kbb figure is accurate seems like a reasonable deal already.   Do you have financing figured out already?
askcarsales,3cgiwd,bangtime,2,Tue Jul 7 20:31:38 2015 UTC,"Yes for the most part.  I've heard that it's better to take financing with the dealer so they give you a better deal on the car and then refinance it with someone else. Is that true?  Also, do you think I need to have an independent mechanic look at it since it is CPO?"
askcarsales,3cgiwd,bangtime,2,Tue Jul 7 20:41:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about having another mechanic look at it just make sure you have all the CPO paperwork in your possession.  Approach the apr and price of the vehicle separately.  Get the right deal for yourself on the vehicle, then worry about the financing.  Doesn't hurt to get pre approved at your bank or credit union beforehand."

Previous care and condition will matter more at this point regardless of the brand/model.  KBB also means nothing on vehicles this old.  Is this a bigger/branded dealer or just a small lot?  It sounds like a $500 trade they're just trying to flip quick.   Might be a fine deal.  Usually those just get sent to the auction."

askcarsales,3ch6wb,Abuero,3,Tue Jul 7 21:50:48 2015 UTC,Lemon laws are tricky and I doubt you could find anyone who'd call a bad transmission something that could result in serious injury or death.  The transmission is by far the most complicated component on your vehicle and likely the most commonly replaced component within the first few months and few thousand miles of ownership.  I'd go ahead and let them fix it.  As for the future value depending on how long you're planning to keep your car it won't matter much.  That car was going to lose more than 50% of its value over the first 3 years anyway and 70% or so by year 7 or 8.
askcarsales,3ch6wb,rodion_kjd,2,Tue Jul 7 22:19:23 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't effect the value. As far as lemon law, contact a lawyer.   I worked at Acura during the TL transmission failures.  Acura swapped a shit ton of trannys. Most never needed to be branded Lemons."
askcarsales,3ch6wb,cubical_hell,2,Tue Jul 7 22:11:43 2015 UTC,No comment other than post a video of it occurring!
askcarsales,3ch6wb,brkdncr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"A shake or rattle in the transmission is not going to be considered a safety issue of such magnitude, if it was you would have refused to drive the car. A new transmission will not considerably affect the value of the car, most states allow three attempts to fix, sounds like you are in the middle of the third, also most states have a 30 day clause on them obtaining parts to fix, so unless its not fixed this time or it takes them more than thirty days to fix i believe you are not going to have any luck with a lemon law claim at this time."
askcarsales,3ch6wb,jayendo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"Ohio, law states one attempt to fix a problem that carries potential for injury or death.  Maybe it's just my opinion but I think brief sudden acceleration of a vehicle while it is decelerating something that qualifies as that."
askcarsales,3ch6wb,el_karacho,2,Tue Jul 7 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"Ohio lemon law is pretty fair to both parties.  Have you been in touch with a Hyundai customer service rep?  If not, get in touch immediately and get them to create a case number.  You creating video evidence is great, but even with that it could easily be argued that you're creating the acceleration, unless your video also shows pedal position (which is a thing that can be measured via ECU) as well.  Getting Hyundai USA involved will make sure the right engineers get involved and will expedite your lemon claim should it come to that.  I'm in OH and while I'm not with Hyundai I'd be happy to help any way I can, PM me if needed."
askcarsales,3ch6wb,el_karacho,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:55:57 2015 UTC,I have been in contact with Hyundai about this issue on 4 different occasions since I bought the car 3 months ago. I have not informed Hyundai USA yet that I am considering lemon law for the car though. Should I contact Hyundai USA to discuss it? Or wait for them to replace the transmission. I have a drafted letter ready that I've had an attorney friend write for me but I'm unsure if/when I should.
askcarsales,3ch6wb,el_karacho,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:15:47 2015 UTC,"It won't hurt your case to discuss the possibility with them.  Here's the thing, you will be arguing over WHAT constitutes a safety/deadly injury scenario.  You will have to prove that the car is doing what you have it on video doing BY ITSELF.  You've had the car to the dealership several times and they can't recreate the issue.  Ohio lemon law also stipulates that if you have a car in for the same issue 3 times, or in for a total of 30 days, and it's not solved, then you (basically) automatically have a solid lemon law claim.  My advice (I am not a lawyer) is to wait until they replace the transmission.  That will constitute their 3rd attempt at fixing the issue.  If the issue persists, then you should have a MUCH easier time proving your case than arguing with them over mysterious sudden acceleration.  Like I said, unintended acceleration claims are VERY hard to prove and more often than not are driver error.  A 3rd unsuccessful attempt to fix a problem is NOT driver error.  I think your case will be stronger if you allow them to try to fix the issue and it doesn't go away."
askcarsales,3ch6wb,Way2evil,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:45:13 2015 UTC,"I have the dealer admitting that on the 3rd attempt , where they finally decided to replace the transmission, in writing that the car does have issues with accelerating when the intent is to decelerate the car. Thanks a lot for the input"
askcarsales,3ch6wb,Antiquecollector,2,Wed Jul 8 22:46:11 2015 UTC,"No problem.  That data in writing definitely changes things.  I'd say fire at will with that letter.

As long as you're prepared to pay the asking price you don't have anything to lose, maybe they come back with $500 off, who knows.

askcarsales,3cernq,candidly1,2,Tue Jul 7 19:11:08 2015 UTC,Repairs are stuff you do for yourself; you don't expect to get that money back.  It's different if you do improvements; repairs and maintenance money is gone once it's spent.

There is no ""book"" value, per se; at least nothing that is accurate.  The car is worth what someone is wiling to pay.  If you don't want to insult them, ask them what they would like for the car.  If they don't know, you can say something like ""Well I think you paid $500 or so; do you think that would be fair?""  If the number they come back to you with is something you can handle, the off you go.  If I was to hazard a guess I'd bet they will be quite happy with $500 and the fact it's going to a friend that's excited about getting the car."

askcarsales,3cfu4o,rodion_kjd,2,Tue Jul 7 16:31:08 2015 UTC,Dealers make some money by setting up a deal between the buyer and their lenders. Sometimes it's not much and sometime's it can be sizable.  I always give the dealer the opportunity to match the financing I already have in place whether buying used or new. It just makes things easier for them as they have a chance to maximize the potential of the sale.  The benefit of walking in with a check is that you might be able to get away from the full pitch of the finance manager.
askcarsales,3cfu4o,hobbestigertx,2,Tue Jul 7 16:59:45 2015 UTC,The only advantage you have with the blank check is to go buy a private party Mini.  This doesn't seem bad.

Manufacturer incentives alone take it below $29k and those don't cost the dealership a dime so there's no reason for them to not give them to you.  Unless you're taking the 0% financing. That will eliminate $1000 worth of rebate and put you back over $29k.  As for how to make an offer? Visit Edmunds.com's new car pricing section, punch in your ZIP and the car's options, verify all the rebates you're getting, find out what the invoice price is, and just point blank tell the dealer if they'll sell it for that number you'll buy it today. I don't have the exact cost sheet of the car right in front of me but invoice minus rebates should be about $27k. Unless you're taking 0% or if you're not in the Southeast region.

If the car has sat for 50 days, there will be strong incentive to move it. Otherwise, if the car moves in relatively short time, then the market bears their price. Not a whole lot else matters. Comparison shopping used cars is not a particularly competitive environment - I've flown hundreds of miles to pick up the right deal before."

I can almost guarantee it wasn't done on the cheaper options, which is why those people decided to trade.   I'd go into the dealer and drive the car. If you like it, offer $7,500 and see if they even counter. If they do, see what you can do. If they won't even counter, then you aren't even close. My dealer prices our cars so well that if a customer asks me for a $1,500 discount I don't even need to counter offer.  EDIT: That dealer seems to have a good reputation; I'd say they probably price their car correctly. Old Hondas hold their value ridiculously well.

askcarsales,3cbcf4,cubical_hell,5,Mon Jul 6 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"Markup is irrelevant. Just market price.  They are betting on the fact the WRX is hot, and that was the last year of the hatchback.   They are asking more than it cost new. That's too much.   The market is hot for that car. I still say it's a $26k car."
askcarsales,3cbcf4,amedianjoe,7,Mon Jul 6 22:47:35 2015 UTC,"I've had next to no luck finding one new/used in my area.   The market is crazy on this vehicle. They have it at 32 because it's a hatchback and they think they can get it / close to it. And they may be right - don't be surprised if they won't negotiate and want to try it at that price for a few weeks. Personally, I would never pay 32 for a WRX.   We (PA) have been selling 2 and 3 yr old WRX's and STi's with ~20-30k for pretty much their original MSRP. Now, these units were clean, but it's still a crazy market."
askcarsales,3cbcf4,Way2evil,2,Mon Jul 6 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thought. I've found other WRX's online in Wisconsin and Indiana with similar mileage and lower priced.

For $32k, I'd spend a little bit more and pick up a brand new Golf R... especially if a hatchback is important.   A WRX doesn't seem like a car I would ever want to buy used. WRX, STI, Evo, GTI, Golf R, R32, etc are all cars I wouldn't touch used."
askcarsales,3cbcf4,KingPupPup,3,Wed Jul 8 04:33:47 2015 UTC,"That is overpriced by quite a margin for that vehicle however the hatchbacks get all the money (at least in Colorado where I sell them).  I have a list of people to call if we take hatchback WRX's in on trade and they do not last long.  We usually get full mark up on them even being in the most competitive Subaru market in the country.  A new one can be had under or at invoice currently which is much much lower than this however,  the hatchback makes the car and subaru tells us no hatchback in new models yet (maybe 2017)"
askcarsales,3cbcf4,EzDuz_it,3,Mon Jul 6 19:56:31 2015 UTC,"That's what I hate the most. I'd have no problem saving my money and buying brand new if they come back out with the hatchback model in the future.   That ""if"" is the problem though. Do I take the chance and spend the money now? Or save it up and hope they come out with that model in the future once I've built a decent sized down payment.   Thanks for the info."

askcarsales,3cb12r,ButtBoxCar,12,Mon Jul 6 14:40:58 2015 UTC,"1 - always let the salesman know you're interested and serious and that this is the car for you.  Don't get emotional about it and still be prepared to walk away if the terms aren't acceptable to you but don't hide the fact that you like and want the car.  We talk to tire kickers and bullshitters alllllllllll day.  A serious buyer get's treated seriously.  2 - I don't know anything about the market for this car in your area but do you think the price is too high because all the other similar cars are priced at $14,991 or because you can't/don't want to afford the $19,995.  If the car is overpriced based on your market research then bring some evidence with you and be ready to answer the question ""If my car is overpriced then why are you here?""  3 - There's nothing to ""look out for"" as far as upselling goes.  You're buying a car, anything you buy that isn't the car is an additional product that you can say ""yes"" to or you can say ""no"" to.  4 - Trade and downpayment don't change the asking price at all.  Your trade has a value, the car they are selling has a value, your downpayment reduces the difference between the two."
askcarsales,3cb12r,rodion_kjd,4,Mon Jul 6 15:51:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I know some of my questions may seem a little bit silly and I appreciate the answers.  As for question number 2, there's not many similar cars that I can base the price off of, there are only 2 cars of the same style. One is 14k with 50k more kms and the other is a 2012 for 24k with the same mileage.   Is it fair to compare the price/worth of this car to other makes/models of the same car class?"
askcarsales,3cb12r,rodion_kjd,7,Mon Jul 6 16:08:23 2015 UTC,"Nope, not fair as different cars have different markets.  I can't speak for Canada but in the US those AWD performance Mitsus are pretty sought after by a certain segment of the population.  So if you want anything more than a cursory discount they'll ask for some sort of justification and believe me when I tell you they know they're the only one for sale in the area."
askcarsales,3cb12r,mattdanskin,3,Mon Jul 6 16:12:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for your insight.
askcarsales,3cb12r,BigDoggie,2,Mon Jul 6 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"Expand your search and find more comparable vehicles.  50k is a big difference and $6k can be justified because of that.  If you are asking for a lower price, you need to be able to show this car has within 10k for less than yours.  If you can't find that car, its probably already a decent deal.  Used cars are all in different conditions so they will likely come back with an explanation as to why theirs is better.  (one- owner, no scratches, dealer serviced, etc.)  Dealers make more money on used cars because it's a moving target. There are no apples to apples comparisons."
askcarsales,3cb12r,ICEFARMER,2,Mon Jul 6 18:54:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think their asking price is off the deep end but used vehicles at most new car dealers lots usually have a comfortable profit built into the price.  That being said, I personally think the 2012 for only 4k$ more is the better value, particularly if you intend to finance (You mentioned a down payment).  You're likely to get better financing terms on a 2012 than a 2009 AND the 2012 may have some balance of factory warranty left.  Don't forget many dealerships have additional fees(not taxes or plates).  IMO it's fair to expect the equivalent of the additional fees as a discount on the price.  Step one - there are loads of online payment calculators available to you.  play around with them.  The 2012 will have a lower payment over a 6 year term than the 2009 will have over a 4 year term at the same rate.  In Ontario lenders will not finance an 09 longer than 4 or 5 years, I don't know if it's the same in Manitoba. PS. Do not take online payment calculator results as definitive, they'll come close but probably not exact.   Step 2 - Check what a personal loan through your bank would look like on the total (price plus tax and plates).  This serves to  give you an idea of what's affordable to you should you choose not to use dealer supplied financing and gives you a payment for the dealer to try to beat over the same term with the same down payment.  PS.  Your bank may try to push a Line of Credit instead.  It's easier for them to approve and its lower rate(usually variable) is attractive.  What they don't tell you is that interest compounds much more frequently on a LOC so in the long run you are likely to actually pay more in interest.  Step-3  Go through the regular steps of visiting the dealership and confirming your selection(walk around, test drive, vehicle history....).  If at some point you are really not comfortable with the car, salesperson or negotiations, then politely end your shopping for that day.  Relax and then continue your shopping in the next day or two.    Best of luck!"
askcarsales,3cb12r,TheRealMeatloaf,3,Tue Jul 7 17:31:42 2015 UTC,"Totally going about this the wrong way.  You want them to know you are interested not another idiot who just wants to drive a sports car and waste their time.  This is extremely common.    Used cars are one in a million.  They are all different.  They will have it priced so that they can make money on it of course but they also aren't going to give it away.  Look at the BlackBook retail/wholesale values for that car in your area.  Ask for a car proof report to see if it has any accidents.  Factor all that into your negotiation.  Be straight that you do want to work a deal and you want the car but you don't want to be an asshole or get emotional about it.    A good deal is a state of mind not a number.  If you pay exactly what they are asking and get the car you want and are happy and get a good car then you've got a good deal.  My guess is that they may wiggle $500-$1000 because they know someone will buy it.  It's a beautiful car.  Down payment has no effect on the price. A trade in is equity towards the vehicle.  HOWEVER, in Canada a trade in does give you GST credit.  You can get an actual cash value for a car on trade then have them ""add value"" to your trade instead of discounting to maximize your GST credit."

Find as many similar vehicles (same make, model, year, mileage) and price the shit out of it.  Collect all those numbers and start emailing all the dealerships within 200km and get their out the door price written in an email/spec sheet.  Take this around to every dealer and see what they're willing to go down to.  Remember you want the OUT THE DOOR price, do not negotiate on payments/terms, etc as that is where they'll try and lead you to.  Refuse to deal with them if they won't give you this information over email.  Once thats settled see if this guy will come down/match your best offer.  Generally you can get them within 5% of each other this way.  Once they stop responding, going down you know you're fairly close to the limit and then you can buy with somewhat confidence."

There is no used car lemon law, and even states with implied warranties only cover you for a few months. Some states do have laws forbidding the sale of vehicles with current frame damage unless it's disclosed in writing to the buyer (damage that was previously fixed doesn't count) but you'd have to have 100% proof that the car was like that when you bought it. Which you don't.  It's an expensive lesson to learn, but hopefully you'll learn from this. Always, always have a used car inspected by a mechanic before you buy.  EDIT- also, get a second opinion about the frame."

There's either something very wrong with this car or it's a scam. This kind of scam involves posting an ad for a car at a price too good to be true, and when you talk to the seller they'll give you some story about how they suddenly had to leave town (new job on short notice, got deployed, etc) and need to move the car quick. They'll tell you how many people they have wanting the car and will ask you to wire the funds right away to get the car before anyone else does. Since it's such a good deal you figure even if the car has problems it's still worth every penny of it, so you do it. But there never is a car.

askcarsales,3cai48,ANAL_CLOWN_SHOES,2,Mon Jul 6 11:28:52 2015 UTC,"From a financing perspective, you might be better off waiting until you have a pay stub or two to show proof of income from your new job.  Might help you get a better rate.  While the dealer will work hard to get you financing, you might get a better rate by first approaching your bank (or even better, credit union) and inquiring about an auto loan.  Assuming your credit and income check out, should should approve you at some rate up to some dollar amount.  Your bank's rate will probably be lower than what the dealer offers.  However, you'd still have the chance to give the dealer the opportunity to match or beat your bank's rate, which might save you a bit of cash."
askcarsales,3cai48,gmdm1234,3,Mon Jul 6 12:49:11 2015 UTC,"For a pay stub or two I'd have to wait until mid-August. I'm doubtful the car would remain on the lot until then. But that logic might also be me getting really excited about having a new car.   So you're saying it would be beneficial to go to my bank and get an financing offer, then head to the dealership and see if they could do better? That would give me a better timeline. I could go today for a test drive and wait until my employer gives official employment, and then go get the offers and head back. Heck, I might even get lucky and have them lower the price a bit.

askcarsales,3cai48,threemadness,2,Mon Jul 6 12:59:39 2015 UTC,If you have a long relationship with your credit union this may not be a big deal.  I just had an offer letter signed w/yearly salary listed and I still got financed at 1.9 percent.

askcarsales,3cai48,genuine_magnetbox,2,Mon Jul 6 15:40:24 2015 UTC,I could. My mom offered to help when I was asking her similar questions about how the whole process works. I initially declined because once the job offer comes through I'll fully be able to do it on my own.
askcarsales,3cai48,psstwannabuyacarm8,2,Mon Jul 6 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"Since you currently have no income, you probably wouldn't be approved without a cosigner.

askcarsales,3cai48,psstwannabuyacarm8,3,Mon Jul 6 18:45:19 2015 UTC,"I've never bought a car from a dealer before. I've bought my first and only car from a private seller, and just handed him cash. I'm looking at a 2013 Accord Touring with 50k miles for $24k from a Honda dealership.    Do a lot of research before going. Look at truecar, look at what other dealers are offering for a similar price, check our craiglists...You need to know how much the car is worth. Also take note of the fact that this a 2.5 year old car has 50,000 miles. Whoever owned that car put at least 20,000miles on the car (if you figure a car runs 150,000-200,000 miles...a third to a quarter of the car's life is over). And guess what? The car is likely coming up on a 60,000 maintenance interval. Usually dealers will put on a new set of tires (but they might not). Go research what sort of maintenance/service is going to be required.    What is a normal down payment? $2k?   There is no ""normal"" amount. The down payment helps lower monthly payments. That said, with very low interest rates available from banks, credit unions, and even dealers...it might make sense to finance the entire loan (we bought when they were offering 0%..no point in putting any sort of down payment or paying anything extra...in the last few years, the money that could have gone to the down payment has been earning anywhere from 10-15%+ in the market).    How does financing work? I'm due to receive a job offer mid-July, but am currently unemployed. My credit score is mid 700.   Personally, I would wait, I am not a fan of ""counting your chickens before they hatch."" That said, every lender is different. Some may not be willing to loan you money, some may, some may offer you unfriendly terms. I have never bought a car without a job...but when I did rent an apartment before I started work (and/or had the physical money to pay), they needed still ran my credit and they needed to see my offer letter and proof that I would be making what I said I was. I imagine the process is similar (but I'm not 100% sure).    Assuming I could get financing based on the points above, what do I do? Just walk into the dealership and say ""I want that car, finance please""?   Assuming you have test driven the cart and like it. They will want to talk numbers. There is where that research I mentioned above comes into play. Once you agree to a price with the salesman...you will be turned over to finance guy/gal. Keep your gaurd up. They are going to try to sell extended warranties, gap insurance, and all sorts of stuff. Regardless of what your salesman says or how friendly the Finance guy is, he is NOT your friend and he actually sets the terms...The salesman might have said, ""oh, we can definitely get 1.9% financing...."" the Finance guy will be the one to say, ""that was based on excellent credit...you only have good credit...we can only get you 3.9% financing."" Feel free to thank them for their time and walk out. They didn't get you the terms you agreed to (some really shady business will try to pull this on people..as most people will just shrug and accept the new terms). Part of when I bought was contingent on 0% financing with zero down.   Be prepared to READ A LOT and spend another 1-2 hours to finally close the deal and sign everything....and you still might have to come back actually pick up your car.  If you want my advice (and people on this sub-reddit might not like it because you are wasting someone's time knowing full well you aren't buying and preventing them from selling to someone else....). Go to another dealership and pick a car you have no intention of buying.... and practice. Test drive the car, ask all your stupid questions, practice negotiating, get a ""feel"" for the entire process (except the finance part). At some point, just say...""thank you for your time. I need to think about this. And leave. Be polite but firm. Until you start signing stuff contracts (not those stupid 4 squares), you are under no obligation for anything."""
askcarsales,3cai48,gleduke,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:59:00 2015 UTC,Down payment in general only lowers monthly payments. None is required sometimes but there are exceptions to that. Such as value of the car and your credit.  First of all are you ok with the price of the car? Are you going to want 10k just because?  If that is the car you want and the price is cool just walk in and say I want that car fill out a credit app. Use your previous employment as your job if it was recent.  If you make 200k a year they don't care what kinda job you have you could get financed with no job at the time. If you are a fast food worker and are making 8$ a hour every year... yea they will want you to have a job.  That credit score is fine. No problems there but the score is not the only thing they look at. They look at it in details because a 800 could have barely any history.
askcarsales,3cai48,HouseOfBull3209,2,Mon Jul 6 12:04:09 2015 UTC,"Price of the car: Mostly ok with it, largely due to watching this sub for some time. A year ago I would've tried to get them down to $20k. Now I'll probably ask that it's set at $23.5k (which is actually what they have it listed as). By set I mean any extra fees/taxes they eat. Would it be unreasonable to ask for some sort of a warranty to be thrown in? Nothing special, just something that says if it blows up in a year then they'll cover it.   I'm not fast food. My last job ended in May at $35 a year, and this one looks to be around $55 a year. Not a ton of money, but far above my peers and relatively able to afford a $420 a month payment with $150 insurance.   My credit goes back to 2011. My mid 700 is the result of a credit card doing a soft pull every month and reporting it to me.   Is going for a test drive and saying I'll have to wait for two weeks a no-no?"
askcarsales,3cai48,gleduke,2,Mon Jul 6 12:44:10 2015 UTC,Well the car very well may not be there in 2 weeks. But there is nothing wrong with that.  To get the best price but worst car buying experience is to go in test  drive sit down to talk numbers then no matter they offer aact like your leaving. This will draw out the best number asap if you are a good actor.   You can ask for anything you want but they will prob say no if you don't act like you are not emotionally attached to the car.
askcarsales,3cai48,Way2evil,2,Mon Jul 6 12:55:44 2015 UTC,Or just go to a dealer where you're not dealing with douchebags.
askcarsales,3c9u0s,Ordinary123,2,Mon Jul 6 05:47:41 2015 UTC,It's not hard at all. Make sure you get a signed title and check to make sure it doesn't need to be notarized if it does get it notarized while the seller is there. Then bring title back to your state and register it.
askcarsales,3c9u0s,thegr8b8m8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:08:35 2015 UTC,What about the time in between when the seller sells it to me and I register it?  Can I just drive the car back home unregistered?

askcarsales,3c9u0s,chandleya,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:32:27 2015 UTC,"Could cause a problem.  Every state is different for instance in PA you can be issued a temporary tag for $10 that is good for 30 days.  I would just get a bill of sale from the seller and go ahead and insure the vehicle and hope i don't get stopped on the way. If you do get stopped showing a bill of sale,  the title and proof that you insured the car should be sufficient for the police."
askcarsales,3c8jrk,ImGoingToMakeYouMad,5,Sun Jul 5 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"Supply and demand. Also, they don't expect anyone to pay their inflated price.

askcarsales,3c8jrk,klieber,2,Mon Jul 6 02:47:20 2015 UTC,"Start from the other end: do your research on what the actual cost of the truck is -- the numbers are out there on sites like edmunds, truecar, etc.  Factor in holdback (assuming they do holdback in Canada) and then offer ~$500 over that amount.  Somewhere between $500 and $1000 over what they paid, before any rebates is a fair price for a truck like that."
askcarsales,3c8jrk,klieber,0,Mon Jul 6 13:29:27 2015 UTC,"The price the dealer paid is very relevant.  I agree it's not the only consideration, but it is a consideration.  And, yes, market value is another key metric.  If Colorados are truly in short supply in Canada as someone else stated, then OP should expect to pay a bit more.  But understanding exactly how much of a margin the dealer is charging is absolutely an important data point for OP to know."
askcarsales,3c8jrk,klieber,0,Mon Jul 6 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"Especially for commodity cars (Camry, Accord, etc.), knowing the dealer's cost helps someone put together a reasonable, fair offer.  You may not like it when customers take that approach, but it is a viable, reasonable approach.    Your approach (polling all dealers within 100km) is also a reasonable approach.  Your way takes more time, however.  I do agree that, for cars in short supply, the dealer price becomes less and less relevant, but it still is worth knowing.  To try and suggest it's meaningless is simply disingenuous."

At my dealership we won't sell them for less than MSRP and I've heard of other dealers that charge more than that MSRP because they know someone will pay for it.   And you can see on their website what I'm talking about.  They only have 2.... Why sell them for anything less for their only 2 in stock
askcarsales,3c8jrk,TheRealMeatloaf,2,Mon Jul 6 19:29:28 2015 UTC,"Dealer markup. It's margin on the truck, usually a flat percentage of 6-8%. For a high demand vehicle they can usually ask what they want, we do the same for base sport 2-door wranglers. That being said, wait til the end of the month, stroll in and offer a few hundred bucks over invoice.   You know what you want, and you're serious about buying it, it'll be an easy new car deal for them. All dealerships have new car targets.

Leasing with questionable future finances can also be dangerous.  You're going to dump the equity of your current car into renting a new car.  What happens if your conditions don't improve?  You still have to give back the Forester or buy-it out which may be impossible.  It's also a bad decision to pre-pay the lease or really make any substantial down payment.  If the vehicle is totalled/stolen, you'll be out a considerable amount of money and have much less to show for it."
askcarsales,3cak5a,skinny8446,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:36:09 2015 UTC,I'm not putting a down payment into the lease and I'm concerned the Honda might not last a couple more years.
askcarsales,3cak5a,skinny8446,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:38:42 2015 UTC,"Ok I missed the payment part.  I thought you were trying to trade even for a lease.    I can't imagine the car not lasting a few more years unless it's just been horribly abused.  It may need repairs but even if it needed major repairs in that time period, it is very unlikely to add-up to anywhere near the cost of the new car.  The cheapest you're going to get into a Forester is $11k-$12k over three years.  That's guaranteed vs the cost to keep the Accord on the road and still have some value down the road.  My bigger concern though is the questionable financial situation.  Leasing forces you to make another decision a few years out and that can really cause problems.  I'd recommend financing slightly used car (even on a longer term) so that if nothing else, in a few years you're not required to do anything but keep making payments."
askcarsales,3cak5a,skinny8446,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:00:08 2015 UTC,Yes I'm looking at a 2011 right now for about $17k.   After my trade in and down payment I'd probably only finance about $7-8k.

askcarsales,3cak5a,MotorboatingSofaB,2,Mon Jul 6 14:20:54 2015 UTC,Now is a good time to lease a Forester.  Subaru is pushing these very hard and most dealers want to sell them and the salespeople are making bonus money on them (previous two months not confirmed for July yet).  Depending on the market for these cars where you live the leases are good enough to have equity at the end of the lease term which is a rarity. Depending on the trim level you decide on the forester leases can be under 200 with minimal cash down. If you can land one of these deals you will not put too much out of that savings you have worked hard for!

If you see cars similar for $13,500 shop elsewhere. If $14,500 is in line with the market go back and buy the car.  Getting $1000 off a used car listing is generally good nowadays.

askcarsales,3c85q5,kylesuo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:33:47 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. Speaking from experience with a KIA Sorento and a Spectra, and a Mazda3, I have to say the Mazda3 is the most fun drive.  The Sorento is the most comfortable drive. It's like flying above traffic. There's little resistance in the 6-cyl engine and you can easily drive 100km/hr with the rpms at 2000. But it's still maneuverable and doesn't have that ""weighed down"" feeling you get in some trucks.  The Spectra is awful. It's a method of transportation but really, you'll hate life driving one. People cut you off, there's no kick or power to the engine, the only redeeming factor is the great turning radius and the smaller size of the hatchback.  But the Mazda3 is really the best choice. The engine has a lot of pep and with proper maintenance you can get over 800km out of one tank. Getting over 130 isn't an issue and it doesn't complain even when I get up to 3500rpm. And people don't cut you off in a mazda3 sedan as often as they do in a Spectra 05 hatchback."

askcarsales,3c9q1c,unknownfamily,5,Mon Jul 6 05:00:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the specific options on that JGC, but you can buy a new Overland for about $45k.  So this is about a $10k savings over a new one.  I like to look at this as a cost/mile first just to see if it even makes sense and this works out to $0.15/mile.  That's really not enough savings on a 2 year old vehicle IMO.    Compare this to other lower-mileage 2014 JGC's that are out there and it seems even worse.  For example, I see numerous Overlands for $37k-$38k that have ~35k miles.  That works out to a savings of $0.22/mile.   You had mentioned the dealer telling you ""the next big depreciation hit will be at 100k miles"" but that's not really true.  It will depreciate steadily with a little bit of an emotional blip at 100k.  There are '12 model Overlands with 95k-100k miles with prices in the $23-$24k range (retail).  So you're looking at losing about $12k over two more years on this particular JGC.  If you financed for 6 years based on your numbers above, you would owe about $26k in two years.  So you'd be upside down by about $5k-$6k would be my guess."

I'm about to put a customer in his fourth Q5 after he was hit dead on and he walked away with no injuries.  The reason they are are more expensive is due to the fact it's a luxury brand your paying for a car that is far safer and out drives a lot of vehicles. It's going to be the same in any other European brand as far as maintaining them.  The biggest issue I see when people come to buying audi's is they buy older one's because they cannot afford a new car but they want the image of a luxury vehicle and cannot afford the maintenance bills when things break when they should really be driving an average vehicle.  Think of it in this aspect  Your Honda Civic cost 20,000 brand new and your oil change is 60 dollars  A timing belt is 1500  My average Audi A3 is about 40,000 and your oil change is 120 dollars   A timing belt is 3500  It's a scaling up factor but most people never think about taking care of the car after they buy it."

It's doesn't make sense to compare a car that is focused on mass production and being as cheap as they can make it versus as car that people are paying a premium for the safety,technology, fuel economy,performance.

Being a taller shorter car with some kind funky torque vectoring AWD system it gets a little scary for me when turning as it is not as stable as a low sedan and I almost lost control a few times. I have AWD so it is fun to drive in the snow too. One thing about the Juke I don't like is the motor pulls very weak at low RPM, so it is kind of sluggish unless you push down on the gas a bit. I drove a Mazda 3 - it is kind of boring and a bit slow. I think a black or red colors look  best on the Juke."
askcarsales,3c90h4,bulbishNYC,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:56:39 2015 UTC,I love the idea of the Juke but I don't drive one because I'm tall and don't fit in it comfortably. I tried.

As for insurance its going to be high because your a male under 25 with zero driving history.  You'll have to pay for full coverage insurance so factor that into your purchase price.

A lease on one of those should be a lot closer to your price range and you won't have to put $4500 down (which is also a terrible idea on a lease).
askcarsales,3c62ie,craiggers14,2,Sun Jul 5 05:41:47 2015 UTC,Thank you and yea I guess I was getting too far ahead of myself. I might look into Mazda or Ford and see what I can do. I just need to figure something out by Monday or I’ll be stranded for work. Appreciate your help.

askcarsales,3c62ie,Surby,4,Sun Jul 5 13:31:25 2015 UTC,Your cannot afford the car. Yes you may lease the car now for $250 but you are only left with two options at the end. You can keep it and finance it at the end for a $300-350 payment for another 72 months with zero money down or you bite the bullet and trade in before your lease is up and gamble the ACV versus payoff which i highly do not recommend.   I have lots of clients that want the Audi A3 because it has the four rings but they do everything they can too get too Volkswagen payments.  Go buy a Jetta 1.8T which is pretty much the same car except less technology and don't fuck yourself for the long run.
askcarsales,3c62ie,TheRealMeatloaf,2,Sun Jul 5 16:34:00 2015 UTC,I've headed everyone's warning here and have decided to completely stay away from leasing. I was already skeptical about the concept and I knew it wouldn't work for me. Thank you for your advice!

askcarsales,3c62ie,user84957398,9,Sun Jul 5 05:05:54 2015 UTC,"Any overages in miles will be moot if you buy it out at the end - but you've negated much of the flexibility inherent in a lease by committing to buying it at the end.   Why not consider a vehicle that leases for less? Maybe a Golf or Jetta? That lower base payment will allow you to buy adequate miles up front so you won't be trapped in 3 years.  Oh, and never put down more than drive-offs. If anything should total the car, insurance pays off the balance of the lease, but it won't give you back any cap reduction."
askcarsales,3c62ie,Quackledork,4,Sun Jul 5 05:40:56 2015 UTC,"You'll be faced with purchasing a car that's worth far, far less than the residual value and because of your severe over mileage you'll be in a must buy situation.

Leasing is really for people who have the money to get a new car every 3-4 years and who don't drive a ton of miles. You should buy a used car at 15K, put that 4500 down, and finance 10500 which should keep you around 200-250 per month."

Go back in and ask them about the internet price. What is it, why is it cheaper, is it the same car, and can you get that price? See what they say. It may be a different car, or it may have a down payment figured in. Either way, ask them. If it's the same car, they should honor their online price.   When you do get to financing - generally Nissan puts a rebate out if you finance on regular terms (think ~2% rate), but takes the rebate away if you do 0%. Most of the time it works cheaper in the long run to take the rebate and do the regular financing. Either way, your rate on a new will be better than used."

For the extended warranty, the mileage adds up for the length of time we plan to keep the car (an extended warranty on a used car did save us from replacing it once, she loves them now), and with two wild kids she wants the protection plan (7 years exterior scratch repair and interior cleaning/damage repair/replacement (if needed).

If you are going to keep the car seven years, big news: like all cars, it is going to get scratched inside and out, wild kids or not. The $1495 ask for the dealer's ""scratch and interior plan,"" and the fact that they can cut the ask about in half without hurting themselves, should tell you what bullshit it is. It's going to be far, far cheaper to take the car to a detailer every couple of years, or treat and buff out small exterior scratches yourself with a tube of color-matched filler goop you can buy at Trak Auto, or do what most of the rest of planet Earth does with interior scratches and mars on a seven-year-old car: live with them."

Regarding the warranty - are you certain you will keep the car for 7 years? How many miles do you think you will have on it? Yes, you can negotiate the warranty."
askcarsales,3c3x5f,bratling,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:20:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice!   Check market value - how much these cars actually go for. Not what the dealership is offering or told you.   So here's a follow-up question on that... I looked up a no-frills Rogue SV AWD on TrueCar.com and KBB.com, and they came out with rather different market values ($23,586 vs. $24,854-$25,465 respectively), so who do I believe? And if I go to the dealer and tell him I'm prepared to pay, say, $23,600 for the vehicle + taxes and fees, he'll (probably) tell me he can't do that, and all I can say is I just looked it up online, and according to KBB, this is the fair market value, but I don't really have anything to back that up, so why would they meet that price? That's actually in your own negotiation FAQ (I read it!), but I don't understand what might compel the dealer to quote us on a more expensive trim than the one they quoted us for yesterday, for less than yesterday's quotes that I have on paper.  For reference, the cheapest Rogue SV listed by the dealer on their website has an Internet price of $24,685 ($26,935 MSRP), but based on what they quoted me yesterday for the lesser trim, I don't understand how I'd get this price.  We will go in person for sure, that's what we did yesterday and we'll be going back once we make a decision. We're between two cars now (Subaru Outback and Nissan Rogue) and we didn't test-drive the Outback yet, and all the Subaru dealerships near us are closed today, so it must wait until the coming week.   Regarding the warranty - are you certain you will keep the car for 7 years? How many miles do you think you will have on it? Yes, you can negotiate the warranty.   That's hard to predict, but we got our current car in September 2008 with 11k miles on it, and it now has 87k. We'd expect to keep this new car for that long, but who knows."

Drove it to and from Canada yearly. If it didn't have all the records like it did i would have walked.  I also owned a evo ix that i beat to hell. Those type of cars can be pricey to fix up.

askcarsales,3bx1nv,8ryan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:34:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can order one exactly the way you want. Let me give you some general info, please verify everything with your dealership.    You need to keep in mind a few things. First off is production timing. An order placed today will be built in late August/September. Then it takes time for the vehicle to ship from the factory. Are you ok with waiting that long?   Second is incentives. The $1000 she is referring to is most likely Trade-In Assist. It's an extra incentive that Ford runs during Holiday Sellathons. Generally speaking, Ford will give you an extra $1000 for your trade as long as it is a 1995 or newer. However, this incentive is temporary. It will probably be done after the Holiday. You need verify with the dealership if this $1000 will qualify for ""Incentive Protection"". That way that program works is like this: By placing an order in the Ford system with your name ""iamacannibal"", Ford should honor the incentives in place at the time of order regardless of when you take delivery."

askcarsales,3bx1nv,HouseOfBull3209,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:14:35 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, YES you can negotiate the price on a custom ordered vehicle. You can negotiate it just like any car on the sales floor. Dealers arent stupid, they know if they print a sales order for you that you're just going to shop it around to the competition, so your only leverage here will be to verbally tell their competitors what the offer on the table is and see if they believe you. You will probably have to put a deposit on file for them to actually order it for you, but of course that deposit will be refundable if the terms of your deal change.   Just make sure you know you are qualified for the loan before you enter this whole process. Check your credit at myfico.com (unless you know you have good credit) and have an income appropriate for the car you are buying. Once the car arrives dont attempt to negotiate again obviously, since you already agreed to a price."

Any legitimate price difference from dealer to dealer on a brand new car is going to be less than $100. People like you look for ways to screw over those of us who are trying to earn a living.

askcarsales,3bvv8w,cusoman,13,Thu Jul 2 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"Unforunately what the dealer PAID for the car doesn't really matter.  Whether the selling price is fair is what counts.  If the person on craigslist didn't know what they had and the dealership bought it at a low price then good on them - if that price +$4,500 is what the car should sell at then you don't have much leg to stand on.  Think of it the opposite direction - if the dealership way overpaid for the car and they're losing $3,000 on it then it works the same way.  If $3,000 under cost is a fair price then its a fair price.  Cars are a marketplace."
askcarsales,3bvv8w,rodion_kjd,3,Thu Jul 2 16:12:44 2015 UTC,"Makes sense.  I'm used to dealing with private owners for my used cars, so going to a lot would be a new experience for me.  How do I go in armed with knowledge of what a fair market price is for the vehicle?  I've been watching some of the other cars fitting my specs in the market, and they haven't exactly been moving in my area from what I can tell."
askcarsales,3bvv8w,rodion_kjd,5,Thu Jul 2 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"I'd use cars.com or autotrader.com and look up the car you're interested in and set your range to 100 miles - whatever a reasonable driving distance for you is.  If they're all priced between $8,500 and $9,200 then that's a fair price.  If the one you're looking at is priced at $9,000 and everything else you find is priced at $7,000 then you can say ""hey, not only do I know what you paid but I know what everyone else is selling their cars for.  Let's talk."""
askcarsales,3bvv8w,bangtime,6,Thu Jul 2 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"The price they actually paid could vary by thousands...maybe even in the dealers favor.    But, that doesn't matter.  A customer could look at my inventory sheet, see how much we own each car for, and it shouldn't affect the price they pay.  Market value affects the price of the vehicle, not how much they paid for it on craigslist.    If I paid $1 for a $5000 car, doesn't mean i'd sell it for $2500 even if I considered that a good profit on a vehicle.  Because someone will buy that car and pay at or near the market value.    If it is still around 60 days from now then maybe you can approach them and have a discussion about what they paid for it because they should be trying to move it very aggressively at that point."

Don't let them kid you; of COURSE it matters what the dealer paid.  Dealers are whores by nature; he might know he has a $4000 profit coming at some point in the future, but that doesn't mean he's going to turn down a $1500 profit NOW.  Next, you can figure that the dealer paid less than what the guy on CL was asking.  Dealers never pay asking price in private transactions.  Why would they?  If they can't steal it, why buy it?  He might step up on a trade when he's moving a new unit, but never on an outright buy unless it's a rare car.  This thing's not rare.  You don't go out of your way to buy a car to only make a few dollars on it.  If I were you, I would tell him right off that you saw the car on CL, and that's what you want to pay, because you know he paid less since he's a pro.  Also, fifteen grand is berserk for that car.  Even wildly optimistic KBB sees if as 13k max, and they are always way high.  He probably ran the thing through the shop and detailed it, but if it had real problems he wouldn't have bought it.  If he won't let it go for $10,500-ish, I would keep looking; I bet he paid like eight grand or less.  <<cranky, grizzled old 25-year industry vet; retired GSM>>"

askcarsales,3bv64j,Sternreisender,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:54:49 2015 UTC,Depends on their allocation (how many they are allowed to order) I don't work for ANY of those dealers.
askcarsales,3bv64j,candidly1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:01:46 2015 UTC,Drop shipping is a freight term that refers to you buying a product from a middle man and the factory ships the product directly to you instead of the middle man who arranged the purchase.  So he's saying order a car through one of these dealers that is willing to have it shipped directly to you instead of requiring it be shipped to them to go through their pre-customer delivery stuff.
askcarsales,3bv64j,skinny8446,3,Sat Jul 4 15:47:28 2015 UTC,"You could probably do a factory order with a dealer in LA at MSRP, then have it shipped to you from there (bonus: you get the exact color and options you want).

askcarsales,3bv64j,skinny8446,2,Thu Jul 2 13:44:20 2015 UTC,"I guess the bigger question is to find out how much shipping one from mainland to the island costs in relation to just possibly paying a premium for the one you can get now.  I'm going to guess you'll have a solid $2,000-$3,000 shipping the car from Georgia and probably a month or more to get it.    I think your best bet is to see what kind of deal you can work out with the local dealer and go from there.  Guessing that they'll inflate the price as much as possible doesn't make much sense.  At least know that's the case before you look at other options."
askcarsales,3bv64j,proROKexpat,3,Thu Jul 2 12:29:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply. I went to the dealership to look at that one today and it was listed for 51k but the sales guy said that there would have to be taxes and dealership fees added on to it and it would ads up to about 60k. I mean I think they're willing to negotiate but is that huge jump in price from listing price to final price? I only asked about the one in Georgia because it's in the color i want and interior i want for 51k also.
askcarsales,3bv64j,skfoto,4,Thu Jul 2 12:37:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds like he's just lobbing numbers out there to feel you out.  If $60k out the door is completely off the table, go back and tell him that.  Ask him to write up the deal so you know exactly what fees/taxes are and go from there.  I'd probably tell him that $60k is completely unreasonable but you're willing to start at $51k before tax and typical dealer fees.  Typical fees are processing, etc that usually add up to $250-$500.  NOT a market adjustment fee of $5,000!  Worst case they say no-way and you can look at other options.    I believe there's an import tax in Hawaii as well that varies based on where you live.  They may know exactly how much it will cost to get a car there from the mainland and mark theirs up accordingly.  In which case you're SOL."
askcarsales,3bv64j,proROKexpat,3,Thu Jul 2 12:47:37 2015 UTC,"The tax is 4.167% its really not that bad at all. They call it a ""use tax"" not a sales tax. Although I believe there is a fee based upon the weight, but again from my dealings I always remembered it being minor."
askcarsales,3bv64j,skfoto,2,Thu Jul 2 13:03:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly you might want to just factory order one. Even if the price and fees are ridiculous, based on what you're telling us about the pricing of the other one you found you're not going to save much if any money going to the mainland, but you're going to have a lot of time and hassle involved in it.  If you have a high volume Dodge dealer available to you, talk to them about an order. Most of the time you can negotiate a pretty good deal on an order but I don't know what the Hawaiian market is like."
askcarsales,3bxcbb,timidmink,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:46:28 2015 UTC,Well you won't be able to get a loan with no income. Student loans are not income. You should scrounge up some cash and find a cheap car to last you the time being or give another go at a cosigner.

askcarsales,3bxcbb,Way2evil,2,Thu Jul 2 23:28:19 2015 UTC,Yes leasing is a loan in itself but you must return the vehicle at the end of the lease. Generally leasing requires better credit than if you were to take a normal loan.

askcarsales,3bwaih,Titleistguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:25:11 2015 UTC,$1500 down payment at most. I can afford car loans for cars up to $18000 if I want to but less is better.
askcarsales,3bwaih,MarkMakesitEasy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:44:11 2015 UTC,"Ohhhhh okay.  Now that makes a little more sense.  I will say with Honda's College Grad Program you will likely be approved as long as you have no derogatory credit, provable income, and 5% down.  Which based on your $1,500 down on an $18,000 car, that does not seem like an issue.    The college grad program only applies to new Honda's.  So you may be looking at a base Civic at that price point.  I will say that just because you get approved on a college grad program does not mean that you qualify for the lowest rates.  An approval is just that, an approval for a loan.  The details are still to be determined."

Lets focus on the getting you the car part.  1. You have an exceptionally difficult situation and it would help us all if we knew what states as the taxes could make a considerable difference and different states have different laws. 2. Your parents co-signing will probably help, though you may be able to get new car financing under a first time buyer program. Example would be the one my dealership has thru a local credit union where you can buy a near new car or new ford (think focus or fiesta) and get the lowest rates available. This could be a better option for you considering that having a warranty would be ideal since it sounds like you might have substantial college debt to make payments on. 3. Reccomendations of cars would be focus, fiesta, fusion, corolla, camry, accord, civic, mazda3, Impala, Malibu, and a whole list of others. Asian or domestic with good MPG. Something that you KNOW is going to be reliable. Looks and options should mean nothing to you at this point."
askcarsales,3bwaih,rodion_kjd,2,Thu Jul 2 19:11:24 2015 UTC,I'm ok with the car loan if I can get one (my dad is willing to cosign if necessary but his credit is not great by any means).

A lot of the time the response I would get was along the lines of ""Yes, I am still interested, I've just been busy"" which either led to questions to answer or an appointment being set. If I hadn't called, we would have probably never seen those people again.  My one recent experience, which to my mind would be unforgivable if I ran that dealership, was no contact whatsoever from the Infiniti dealer when my lease was coming to an end. Absolutely nothing. I was interested in a Q50 hybrid and may well have got one. In the end I decided to keep my old clunker and wait."
askcarsales,3bulv2,armoured_wankball,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day, in my opinion, it boils down to this :  Salespeople are sick of customers thinking that they should be thrown in jail for trying to make a profit.  All salespeople profile potential customers.  The customer that's asking us to run around working up numbers and emailing them... is just going to take that information and shop it to a bunch of dealers trying to get that last $100 off.  It's not worth it.  So when you're not even willing to show your sincerity by committing the time by going in to the dealer, many salespeople figure they've got a ""grinder"" on their hands, and who wants to spend hours chasing a ""mini""(a minimum commission paid to a salesperson on a very low profit deal, often times cars sold at a loss, typically around $100-$150).    If you want to get a deal done quickly, you need to set aside half a day, go in, do the deal face to face, so the salesman knows that if he does his job, he's got a paycheck coming, otherwise, all the salesman is gonna think is that he's doing someone else's job for them... think of it as loading a gun for someone to shoot you with.  You get numbers from a dealer..and then go shop elsewhere, and if that dealer beats your number, you did the work for nothing."

It's not worth it.   So if you get an inquiry like that do you just decide to never return the phone call and leave the customer hanging, like in the OP's situation, or do you tell them that they'll need to come in to get the numbers and you'd be happy to have them ready when they walk in the door if they'll make an appointment with you?  Hopefully you do the latter."

The other side is that people don't want to spend hours in a dealership to get rubbish numbers or find out the car they wanted isn't actually there. People's time is tight nowadays too. When I sold, I did a lot of deals where the first time I saw the buyer was when they came to pick up the car or when I delivered it. How long does it take to run some numbers and send them back. If they get shopped, c'est la vie. A whole 5 minutes down the drain.   I remember emailing a certain Infiniti dealer in the Seattle area. I'd picked out a car, did my research and presented a deal I though would work for both of us. I got the most vitriolic email I have ever seen back from the sales manager, accusing me of being a grinder, not understanding how car sales work, not wanted them to make a profit, taking the food out of his kids mouths, complete with language that would make Malcolm Tucker blush.   After that, I sent a similar request to the Portland Infiniti dealer based on a car they had in stock. Their Internet sales person called me back and said they could actually do slightly better than my proposal. We tied up everything in a couple of hours via phone, fax and email. I picked the car up that weekend in about an hour. Pity the buggers never called me at lease end though :)"

A Salespersons number one job when taking a phone call is to book an appointment.  They're far more likely to close a deal with a customer at their desk than over the phone.  Many Salespeople feel that a shopper only becomes a customer when they land on the lot. There are many phrases shoppers sometimes unknowingly use that indicate they're not likely to visit or buy in the near future.  If a shopper is showing no commitment to at least visiting the store, why would the salesperson bother doing any work for them?  Laziness is also a thing in all industries."

In one of those cases I received two different calls from two different salesmen in the following days asking if I'd like to come in to see the car I had inquired about even though I'd been told earlier on my visit to the store that it was sold.    All this leads me to believe that there are some unscrupulous dealers who will tell you they have a car available to get you in the door and then tell you it was just sold when you arrive, hoping to sell you something else while you're there."

In a purchase you are paying down depreciation and gaining some equity plus interest. You can always buy the car you are leasing at the end of the lease. Sometimes the residual works that its a good deal, but that is rare.   This sounds like some doublespeak. There is no magical lease where you actually own the car but are leasing it. Its a lease, and you can buy out of the lease whenever you want."

If you cannot afford the car as a purchase, then you should not lease it.  Leasing is really for people who do not intend to keep a car for more than 3-4 years, and do not want to mod it at all."
askcarsales,3bu2ws,skinny8446,2,Thu Jul 2 04:27:09 2015 UTC,"You can describe almost all leases as a ""lease to buy"" option.  Doesn't mean it's a good deal....  Leasing and then buying is almost always going to be more expensive financially than just buying it right from the start.  This is due to typically higher interest rates, lower amortization, and more fees.  If you absolutely know you want a new car every 2-3 years, leasing can be a reasonable option."
askcarsales,3bu2ws,ClintTorus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:39:00 2015 UTC,"What your salesman told you was how every lease works. You arent renting a car when you lease, all those payments go towards the car and you can always buy the car for the remaining value once the lease is over."

That's going to result in the smallest amount of your money spent, even if you drive high miles and have to buy extra mileage allowance at the beginning of the lease.  If you insist on buying for some reason, buy a late model 1 or 2 year old used one. You're going to lose a lot less money on that vs. a brand new one if you trade it in 2-4 years."

Now, if you're really only looking for something for a yearlong term, you should look into a ""Lease Assumption"". It's where you take a lease over from another party that would like to get out early. There might be a few around where you're looking that have about a year left. You'll still have to finance just like any other deal, but typically there is no down payment or up-front dealer fees. It's usually pretty cheap to do this.

If you want to buy one,  fast and easy,  just go to your local dealer, be nice,  test drive,  then sit down and answer all the sales guys questions. Then ask for $400-$500. He'll come back with a $300 discount. Ask for another $100 and he might do it. Don't be surprised if he doesn't. These types of vehicles are ad cars. This means they are priced so low as it is,  that they just want you to come down and flip you to a higher, more in demand vehicle."

askcarsales,3bsch9,SweetPotatoTot,2,Wed Jul 1 19:24:55 2015 UTC,"So you've done your research and discovered that dealer value for a CPO version is $32,000.  You're asking if it is delusional to offer $28,500 for the car, including all taxes and fees, so somewhere around $26,500 for the car, or $5,500 under what your own research says is market value for the car.  I think you can answer your own question."
askcarsales,3bsch9,rodion_kjd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:34:58 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Thank you for the quick response! Based on the research, how much should realistically expect to offer? $30k OTD? Or is that still way too low?   Perhaps I'm not reading the values correctly either, but my initial $28.5k value came from $26k trade in value (which I thought would include taxes) + $2k for CPO + $0.5k for reconditioning. I assumed the dealership would be making the majority of $ via financing and the trade in as well."
askcarsales,3bsch9,rodion_kjd,2,Wed Jul 1 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"I think a realistic offer is what Edmunds says... that's what they do, provide a guide for consumers regarding pricing on cars.    As to the rest of your points I think any sales manager in the country would personally suck your dick if you got their average reconditioning costs down to $500.  You're at least $1500 short on that figure.  They'll make a few hundred dollars, maybe, on the financing, and they only make money on your trade if they sell it for more than they paid you for it.  A 2007 Jetta with 80,000 miles is a wholesale piece."
askcarsales,3bsch9,rodion_kjd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:46:34 2015 UTC,"I see. Sorry, I thought I had read that reconditioning costs were closer to $500 elsewhere, which is why I made that assumption.

askcarsales,3bsch9,el_karacho,2,Wed Jul 1 20:01:16 2015 UTC,Thank you for the clarification on that. I'm glad I decided to post here first before making the offer... Definitely better than being laughed out of the room and losing out on the car entirely. Thank you so much for the advice!
askcarsales,3broi1,hippiesque,3,Wed Jul 1 16:32:51 2015 UTC,4% isn't bad but why are you financing 8 years? Drop back to 6 or 7 and you'll probably get your 4% at a 701.

When/if you get a decent job after graduating then look at buying a  nicer car.

askcarsales,3broi1,TeamDisrespect,6,Wed Jul 1 20:51:28 2015 UTC,Unless you are putting a bunch of money down now or plan to when you refi you won't be able to. Your 8 year loan will not pay off much of the principal in the first year and you'll owe too much on the car to refi in 12 months.

askcarsales,3bs179,error_4o4,3,Wed Jul 1 18:30:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I went back and looked at the paper work. I put down 1318 from equity + 1500 lease cash + the complimentary first payment was put down in cap reduction too ($451). I'm guessing that still consitutes a low downpayment on a lease ($3250ish)? I am pretty new to this.  I'll probably just see if the dealer can appraise it at the 12-18 month mark while I'm in for service. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised, but at least I'd know where I stand.  I don't mind paying top dollar for the car I want if it's worth the price, which with my experience with my Lexus thus far - it likely will be. Budget is likely not an issue, provided the Lexus doesn't do anything too crazy with the '16 pricing. If the RX jumps over $10K from a MSRP standpoint from an applicable '15, then I might have something to worrya bout.  I just would want to at least be at a point where I could break even on the car. If that's not until 6 months prior to lease expiration (I've heard that is when the dealer can start pulling you out of the lease and forgive your payments. Not sure if that is true), then so be it.

askcarsales,3bs45g,amnesiac854,4,Thu Jul 2 04:49:40 2015 UTC,"Oh man. Welcome to the wild world of Subaru shopping in Colorado, where the rules are made up and the points don't matter.   Seriously though, get used to the fact that anything that says Subaru on the back and has a turbo under the hood is going to be priced at least 3 grand above book, and that's on craigslist. The XT's are one of, if not the most, popular models of Subaru's in general but especially in Colorado. There's a reason, they are fucking awesomely fun to drive while also being reasonably practical. The horsepower stats are comparable to a WRX.   So, that being said I think you can get them to move a little on the price but there is no way in this state you are going to get anywhere close to book value from a dealer. If you have 14k cash I would suggest just telling them that outright (or 13,500 if you want to have a back up) and I'd bet they would knock some money off to get you out the door at 14. Depending on your taxes and D&H that could be a sweet deal   If it where me though I'd find another make/model of turbo'ed SUV and get a lot more for my 14k or if I absolutely had to have an XT I would buy one from across the country and get it shipped   EDIT: I forgot you asked about the accident. Not surprising. When a customer brings me a turbo'ed scoob on trade I don't even ask if it's been in an accident before, I just ask how many. Just check out the car fax (lower owner the better) and as long as the airbag wasn't deployed and the title is clean and no frame damage is indicated you're fine"

The other XT I linked to above has the same mileage and is $3500 cheaper than the 05' but still marked up $2400 from KBB and NADA. ($10,000 from $7,600)  I'm comfortable forgoing the premium trim and buying 1 year older to save $3,500!

askcarsales,3bqvjf,homeschooled,5,Thu Jul 2 14:55:53 2015 UTC,"Let's call it $2,000 generously.   Unless your car is literally falling apart, you should NOT sell it for that. I have an '07 Civic with similar miles that needs a new bumper and has some paint chips, also some TLC needed, and I've know I could get $6k for it at least.  Check Kelly Blue Book before shorting yourself!"

askcarsales,3bt46c,melodykramer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"Not really knowledgeable but just did some googling for you.    To register your vehicle for the first time, visit your local DMV office and present the following:   -Your new North Carolina driver's license.  -Acceptable proof of insurance.  -A notarized vehicle title. If a lienholder has your vehicle title, present your current out-of-state registration and odometer reading. If there are co-owners to the vehicle, all necessary documents must be presented or filled out for both owners.  -A completed Title Application (Form MVR-1) and Declaration of Eligible Risk (Form MVR-615).  -Cash, check, or money order for the $28 plate fee, plus other state taxes (see below for a list of all possible fees and taxes).  So, it appears you will need your license.  Source."
askcarsales,3br4hw,Lleu,11,Wed Jul 1 13:59:13 2015 UTC,"Both. The dealer saw you had no leverage and is trying to make money off you. Not cheating you, mind you. but still trying to make a profit off you.  And you're being unrealistic in thinking that with your horrendous credit history and upside down trade in you could get a good deal on a new car.  My advice is to get a cheap used Hyundai Elantra or accent for under $10k. You're still gonna take a bath on the interest, but you won't be digging yourself a bigger hole.  I was in a similar situation about 6 years ago, and walked out when the dealer quoted me 19% interest for a used Sonata with 40k miles.  Told them they had my number.  Kept getting calls every day from the salesman dropping the interest rate, and warning me that the car I wanted could sell any day. Eventually settled on 11.5% interest for 5 years.  Paid it off after 3, and improved my credit since then.  I just had to bite the bullet for a while.  Looks like that's what you're going to need to do here.  http://www.cars.com/for-sale/searchresults.action?PMmt=1-0-0&crSrtFlds=stkTypId-feedSegId-mkId-pseudoPrice&feedSegId=28705&isDealerGrouping=false&rpp=50&sf1Dir=ASC&sf1Nm=price&sf2Dir=ASC&sf2Nm=miles&zc=85001&rd=30&prMx=12000&prMn=0&stkTypId=28881&mkId=20064&pseudoPrice=undefined&yrId=51683&yrId=47272&yrId=39723&yrId=34923&yrId=51683&mdId=20605&searchSource=GN_REFINEMENT"
askcarsales,3br4hw,eli5taway,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:10:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response and the link!  I wasn't necessarily looking for a new car, but he told me that I'd have better chance of getting financed with one.  I didn't take the percentage rate into account though so I can see where that would make me seem a bit unreasonable.  Do you think that I would be better off just paying my truck off and driving it until I have a better down payment, or would it be best in the long run for my credit to trade it in and continue staying current on my payments?"
askcarsales,3br4hw,HouseOfBull3209,4,Wed Jul 1 14:28:47 2015 UTC,"People come in all the time shopping for new cars, saying their maximum payment is $250, 300, 350, etc. Always an incredibly low round number like that. So, it's entirely possible that you gave them the impression that you could do $400-ish per month but were looking for a lowball payment at first."
askcarsales,3br4hw,lincunguns,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:03:48 2015 UTC,That's understandable I suppose.
askcarsales,3br4hw,lincunguns,2,Wed Jul 1 21:04:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it is not as simple as it seems to land you in a payment that works, no matter how upfront you are.  Let's say your Sonic was 15k.  Since that payment didn't work, you'd assume that you could find a car for 12k.  Well, that car will be a couple of years old with some mileage.  The bank may have offered a 72 month loan on the new car because the car will have value throughout the loan.  But with a used car, the bank may only go 60 or 48 months, so while the car is cheaper, the monthly won't be.    Dealerships work with several banks so that they will have the best chance to get all kinds of different customers the best finance deal, but because of this, there is no hard and fast rule for what rates you'll get with x credit score, or which car will be approved for how much and how long.    I'm sorry if I'm not being clear, but the salesman's job is to sell you a car.  If he sells you the car he knows will get you within 350, he'll have to be safe and show something that's probably going to be closer to 250-300.  That car won't be nearly as nice, and you won't want it.  Instead, he showed you a car you wanted and hoped that you were like most customers, who were willing to stretch their budget for the right car.  I know it's a pain in the ass, but he did what he had to do.  You sell the car that the customer wants, and if you don't do that, you won't sell any cars.  I'm sure your salesperson appreciated that you were up front, but it is the bank you are borrowing from, not the dealership, so he can only guess what kind of rate you'd get.  You've got to think about it from the other side too.  Your salesman does not benefit from spending all of that time trying to get you done if you don't buy a car.  He wants it to work, because otherwise, he wouldn't get paid.  You've put yourself in a very difficult situation to work with.  You've bailed on previous payments and are now basically asking the bank to lend you more than your new car is worth, so it isn't going to be simple for a while."
askcarsales,3br4hw,lincunguns,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:06:21 2015 UTC,Would working with the dealership that I purchased my truck from help?  Or the bank that has my current loan?  I do understand I'm a tough person to work with.  Is it better to say I only want a 250-300$ payment to leave that wiggle room?
askcarsales,3br4hw,sscall,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:08:41 2015 UTC,"It would be better to give that range, yes.  And it really won't make it any better to go to the dealership where you bought your truck unless they work with better sub prime lenders.   I mean, is your issue that you don't think they are working with you enough? Because I doubt that.  Your salesman just showed you too much car but I'm guessing that was what you wanted in a car"
askcarsales,3br4hw,savyur,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:17:19 2015 UTC,I actually went in to look at a Spark that was under 10k.  He said because there was a promotion going on for the Sonic it would absorb some of the negative equity and to not even think about a used car.
askcarsales,3br4hw,Quackledork,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:27:37 2015 UTC,Well if you didn't have anything to put down then he's probably right
askcarsales,3br4hw,Uncle_Bo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:30:26 2015 UTC,"Well, they did get you financed for a car when you were in negative equity.  That being said, they should have had an idea that they wouldnt be able to get you into a new car for $350 a month with no down payment and that trade value.  I would say its just a shitty situation all around."
askcarsales,3br4hw,jayendo,3,Wed Jul 1 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I know I'm a tough customer that's precisely why I volunteered all my info up front.  It would make no sense for me to do otherwise."
askcarsales,3br4hw,GatorSe7en,2,Wed Jul 1 14:12:44 2015 UTC,They tried their hardest. Your situation pretty much put you in the lowest tier for a new car sale. Most people leave negotiating room when they disclose what they 'want' to pay. You need to look at much cheaper cars for a while.
askcarsales,3br4hw,Southsideswinger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"The simple fact here is that with terrible credit, you have almost no negotiating power. You pretty much have to take what you can get. That being said, the ""we went to war for you"" is just a tactic to make you feel bad and accept the deal. They may have genuinely worked hard to get you the deal, but you didn't take it.   Save your money and go back to a dealership when you have your truck paid off and a few thousand to put down. Then you can get a decent car. As it stands, you aren't going to get anything but a crappy deal at this point."
askcarsales,3br4hw,Southsideswinger,2,Wed Jul 1 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"Let's say the purchase price of the Sonic was 17000 (per True car).   And let's say they are hitting you for $500 in fees, etc.  And your trade is worth $2000.   And interest is at 17%.   And taxes are 7%.  My pymt calc app says $371.   So, yeah, they're trying to take you deep.    Your credit is badly damaged but hope you have been working on it the last 4-5 years.   I highly recommend you apply for car loans at various banks, credit unions, etc.  Try Capital One.com, bankofamerica.com, places like that.   You can prolly beat 17%.  Take the truck to CarMax for an appraisal.   $2000 seems low for an 8 yr old truck unless its completely trashed.   At least you will know if the dealer's trade offer is in the ball park.  And... dude.... buy yourself a used car.   A Sonic ain't all that.  A 2 yr old Hyundai Elantra or Nissan Sentra with low miles is around $13-14k.   If you are going to trade a useful tool for a throwaway car, at least don't pay top dollar for it."
askcarsales,3br3sz,pkrjp,2,Wed Jul 1 13:52:58 2015 UTC,"This answer will be unsatisfying but you can sell it for whatever you can sell it for.  I'd put it online, with good pictures, for $8,500 and a big, bold headline that says ""PRICED TO SELL QUICKLY, BELOW KELLY BLUE BOOK"" and be prepared to take anything over $6,000."
askcarsales,3br3sz,rodion_kjd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"I think your numbers are on target.   A dealer would retail that for $11,000 or so.   If you advertised it for under $9000, that would be market correct.  You have great miles on it.  Make sure it presents well.   A black car needs to be detailed and polished to really stand out.   Good pics, a well written ad, and some patience will pay off for you."
askcarsales,3bqsbw,Kollarism,10,Wed Jul 1 11:57:05 2015 UTC,"I'd call $5,000 - $6,000 more than ""slightly"" upside down.  To put it in perspective on a three year lease you're adding $139 - $166 to whatever payment you come up with just carrying that negative equity.  On a five year finance you're adding between $84 - $100 per month to whatever payment you come up with.  I think the ""best"" course of action is to wait a bit and pay down the Corolla more.  If you insist on doing it you'll pretty much have to go with a new car because of the LTV (loan to value) needed to cover your negative equity.  So if you're looking at a $25,000 car and you carry $6,000 of negative you're looking to borrow 124% of your new car's value.  That'll only happen on a new car and only with GREAT credit.  Money down changes things a bit because it lowers your LTV."
askcarsales,3bqsbw,rodion_kjd,2,Wed Jul 1 13:03:13 2015 UTC,"We could realistically drop 5k to remove the negative equity if needed. I do have 800+ credit, so that wouldn't be an issue.  I don't know what the dealership would give for the Corolla, as it has low miles. I could be low balling the value of the car."
askcarsales,3bqsbw,rodion_kjd,3,Wed Jul 1 13:38:03 2015 UTC,Do you have the VIN handy?  I'll tell you what its worth.

askcarsales,3bqsbw,Way2evil,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:14:58 2015 UTC,There goes 20 to 30% of value if that's true.  Sucks for op
askcarsales,3bqsbw,Austiny1,2,Wed Jul 1 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"Your car is worth what it is worth.  I can't see it, obviously, but if you feel it is in the top 1% of 2011 Corollas on the road then sure, it's worth top end money.  You said it is average so it is probably a little worse than average since people always over estimate their car's condition and value so I'd assume average money for it.  As far as offering incentives to minimize the amount of negative equity that isn't in the hands of the dealer it is in the hands of the manufacturer.  If they have incentives on the car great, you can use them to your advantage.  If there are no incentives then the dealership has to work within the profit margin on the car which, on a Mazda, is likely less than $1,000."

askcarsales,3bqo53,AnotherPint,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"You could possibly get one with less mileage for around the same price but it depends;  Dealer or private sale?, Is it a sedan or hatchback?, is it a GX, GS or GT?, Does the Carproof report any damage?  The cleanliness of a car doesn't necessarily indicate what shape it's in mechanically.  at first glance the price seems fair but still depends on the answers to the questions above.  Dealer:  If there's any fees other than tax and registration/plates I would ask for that amount as a discount at least.  You don't necessarily need to negotiate on price unless it's a budget thing for you.  For example, if you feel like the tires don't have much life left on them you could ask for new tires instead.  Private sale:  There are more risks involved in a private sale but it could return you the best deal."
askcarsales,3bqo53,BigDoggie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:10:24 2015 UTC,"Is this a private sale or from a dealer?  Usually you can knock more than $88 off a price.  You should be able to go to $8000.

Let's think for a second. Let's say this is a pretty good job where you are making ~5k/month after taxes. You get the financing you want, and get a new car, say it costs you a total of 20k. now if you take that + your current car situation into account, after 6 months (not accounting for rent, so probably to be more realistic... a year or so) you are back at 0. That means with the above assumptions, if you work at this place for 4 months and get fired, you would be in exactly the same situation you are in now, that is 10k underwater on a car with no job. So, unless you are going to be making well over 100k per year, this job is probably not putting you in a better position financially."

askcarsales,3bo8bf,RexRaider,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:46:22 2015 UTC,I did miss the fact that you hadn't taken it off the lot yet.
askcarsales,3bo8bf,jayendo,-8,Wed Jul 1 20:48:11 2015 UTC,you posted with the correct user name this time... good job
askcarsales,3bo8bf,superthrust,-5,Wed Jul 1 01:33:03 2015 UTC,"Reading your post and all replies makes me post here with my issue I had.  Jeep. New. Rolled off lot and five days later my engine blew. Took it back to dealer and had to walk two miles in 114 degree weather. They didn't wanna give me a new car or repairs or nothing. I raised hell. The manager insulted me and acted like it was my fault for not having it break down at the lot. He then started saying some racial slurs in a subtle and condescending way. I left before I cold cocked in. Afterwards I called all the management at every building of their name, even the owner of the entire auto group before he died. A day later, I got an apology call, letter, brand new SUV fully loaded, full tank of gas and gas card, and more. The asshole guy in question was the manager of the building I went to, and a week later he was gone and the building was closed down.  I was nuts at first and I can understand why you're mad. But do what I did. Calm down and collect your thoughts. Think about everything thoroughly. Weigh in all the choices. And understand that they don't have to do shit at this point other than point you to Honda.   You, on the other hand, are offered a new transmission. New parts, by Honda. I understand it's not brand new like it rolled off anymore but had you taken it and came back with the issue later you would have to do what you're doing now. New part means new part. You are basically getting a brand new car here with one of the major components being brand new and not having to worry about it.  Don't complain. Transmissions are expensive and a brand new one is a good thing. Stop acting like they spat in your face and demanding things. If you act like an entitled Whiney bitch to them who is demanding shit, you will not get anywhere with them. If you're calm and collected you can easily get what you want."
askcarsales,3bo8bf,b3h3lit,4,Wed Jul 1 02:20:55 2015 UTC,"What part of my post is whiny? I took a sales manager advice and informed me that it was something minor and could be easily fixed with an adjustment.    Not really pissed off, just kind of put off on this situation.  I bought a brand new car and right away it needs a new transmission.  I took half a day off work and drove down the dealership to talk with the Honda Sales Manager.  I informed him politely on how I felt and how buying a new car with a transmission problem right away does not make me feel confident in buying this car as new.  I suggested things on what could be done to remedy this issue and what I'm pushing for is the dealer trade for the same exact model.  They offered it in the first place, and its going to take weeks for the new transmission to come in. I'm not asking anything unreasonable."
askcarsales,3bo8bf,Micosilver,2,Wed Jul 1 02:48:54 2015 UTC,Tell them you won't take that car as you haven't taken physical delivery yet and if they want to keep your business they need to get you another one.
askcarsales,3bo8bf,jayendo,2,Wed Jul 1 04:55:41 2015 UTC,"Jeep. New. Rolled off lot and five days later my engine blew   I don't need to read any further - different situation. You took delivery, the car broke, now it's a warranty issue. OP never took delivery."
askcarsales,3bo8bf,flume,-22,Wed Jul 1 14:27:18 2015 UTC,I want... i Want... I want... wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... if you haven't driven it off the lot you can likely get them to find you a new car... but  it sounds like you might be getting ready to go into full whiny bitch mode if that doesn't happen right away... don't do that...

askcarsales,3bq0wb,Ready_4_Change,3,Wed Jul 1 05:43:59 2015 UTC,The DFW Metroplex is a good place to buy a car because there is a lot of competition between dealers. The cost to register a car in Texas is significantly cheaper than in California.  I would consider selling your current car private-party as Mustangs are very popular and easy to sell.
askcarsales,3bq0wb,hobbestigertx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:06:03 2015 UTC,"My first step in this process was to go to Carmax in California for a quote on them purchasing my car from me. I have edited the main post with the details of my trade-in (sorry for leaving that out).  They only offered me $3500 :-/ I am not aware of the Dallas market, are most cars sold via Craigslist or is there another medium that is used for car sales in Dallas?"
askcarsales,3bq0wb,hobbestigertx,2,Wed Jul 1 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"I have had good luck selling private party and that includes using Craigslist, AutoTrader, and eBay.  The first time is always a little scary, but just checking listings currently on Craigslist shows Mustangs similar to yours are being offered between $4,500-$7,500, so I think chances are good that you could sell it in the middle of that range.  Of course, you need to be careful to screen out the unqualified buyers. But as I said, I've always had good luck selling cars myself."
askcarsales,3bq0wb,worldsgoodestteacher,2,Wed Jul 1 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"Texas sales tax is 6.25%, you can haggle an OTD price, although most dealerships I've dealt with in Texas (Laredo, San Antonio, and Corpus Christi) like to rock the 4 square...."
askcarsales,3bq0wb,tuck4x4,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:54:59 2015 UTC,"Is that sales tax for the entire state of Texas or will it vary based upon the county I purchase from?  I also just looked around at the 4-square, I have never heard of it before, and was rather intrigued how that tactic is used."
askcarsales,3bq0wb,worldsgoodestteacher,3,Wed Jul 1 16:20:08 2015 UTC,"The entire Nation of Texas shares the same 6.25% regardless of make, model or cowboy hat. You will also have a non-tax fee that is percentage based. It is used to cover road repair and things like that. It will usually be in the range of 180 to 200 or so. The only variable will be the dealerships Doc fee. Not an official fee of course, so feel free to argue about it.   Negotiate away! Its a free country, (Texas)."
askcarsales,3bq0wb,pmo86,2,Wed Jul 1 20:05:03 2015 UTC,"To expand on that doc fee, remember that it is negotiable, I've seen low in the 150-250 range, although I've seen as high as 800! That is an easy way for F and I to make up money on the backend of a sale, negating some of the savings made during negotiation....."
askcarsales,3bq0wb,pmo86,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:01:38 2015 UTC,Great insight. Will have to check the details and keep track of the numbers during the negotiation process to make sure they don't slip these fees past.
askcarsales,3bq0wb,Austiny1,2,Thu Jul 2 04:24:29 2015 UTC,Doc fee is max 150. Title/reg/inspection will run about 125. So you are looking at tax plus 275ish.
askcarsales,3bp8k4,smoogums,3,Wed Jul 1 01:24:15 2015 UTC,The stupid extended warranty harassment is why I always finance through my credit union.
askcarsales,3bp8k4,Austiny1,2,Thu Jul 2 01:20:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean it was a 5 minute conversation explaining why I didn't want a three  year warranty extension for the tune of 2500.  That's like two major repair bills right there.  If my car has this many issues before I even hit 60k miles we got problems with your brand.
askcarsales,3bp8k4,Micosilver,4,Thu Jul 2 02:20:18 2015 UTC,"Good job man, congrats! Maybe if you had bought the warranty - you would have closed the deal on the finance girl too, married my ass..."
askcarsales,3bptz9,Ansaatsusha,3,Wed Jul 1 04:33:31 2015 UTC,"If it's got the 2.7 V6 engine run like hell. It's one of the worst engines ever made.  You're never going to find a $1500 car where ""everything is good."" They ALL need work to some degree. Have it inspected by a mechanic before you buy, and make sure you leave yourself some wiggle room in your budget to get the car safe and roadworthy.  As for negotiating... any car that you can actually drive for $1500 is a good deal, and the seller knows this. Go ahead and try to offer less but don't be surprised when they say no."
askcarsales,3bptz9,skfoto,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:15:54 2015 UTC,"Good point by skfoto.    $1500 is hoopty money.   If the car starts and runs, is safe (brakes and tires OK, wipers and lights work), and can pass an inspection if required by your state, its probably OK to buy.  Sounds like it was well cared for, but who knows.  The V6 engines in those cars were not good but the 4 cyl is fine.     What is your final price?   Anything you can negotiate.  I can't imagine the owner is going to wheel and deal on a $1500 car but you may get them to move $100-200 or so.   Worth a try."

askcarsales,3bq072,brodaddy,3,Wed Jul 1 05:36:34 2015 UTC,Here is a piece of advice:  Don't second-guess a done deal.  I think you did OK.
askcarsales,3bq072,Micosilver,2,Wed Jul 1 13:52:52 2015 UTC,"Well, your math is off mainly because you're calculating the depreciation amount based on MSRP.  Residual is $15.2k but the depreciation is the difference between the selling price (something you never mentioned) and residual.  $1,900 worth of extras is crazy town too.  Either way, $300/month (adjusted to include the down payment) for an Accord EX is perfectly reasonable."
askcarsales,3bq072,skinny8446,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:42:55 2015 UTC,They told me the selling price was the MSRP... Is that wrong?
askcarsales,3bq072,skinny8446,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"It's not usually the best place to start, that's for sure."
askcarsales,3bq072,skinny8446,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"Well then I guess what I'm asking is, do you think I overpaid?"
askcarsales,3bq072,Paddywagon11,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"As I originally stated, it's a reasonable payment for that car.  Hard to say if you really overpaid since I don't know credit or tax situation."
askcarsales,3bq072,bcoup1199,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:39:01 2015 UTC,Credit is 800+ and tax was 0.625% in the state of Texas. Thanks for the advice though!

askcarsales,3bnzsi,amedianjoe,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:02:59 2015 UTC,"yes, we did take the car home. I read the FAQ to familiarize myself with a spot delivery before we went to the dealership since I knew the bank wouldn't be open by the time we arrived. We signed a contract that said if the loan didn't get approved, then we have to return the car, and I get my down payment back. They ran the loan contract at 3.99% but said they are submitting the information to a few banks and would tell us which specific one when the banks open on Monday. So I guess I'm wondering if it is usual for them to not provide any documents stating the loan was approved?"

askcarsales,3bo8ed,HouseOfBull3209,0,Tue Jun 30 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"They're in the same compact class but the Cruze just feels tiny inside to me. The dash and center console pretty much completely envelop me from the driver's seat. I feel like the center console is closing in on me.   Even though the Sonic is smaller than the Cruze it felt much more open and airier than the Cruze.   I like the Golf (also considering a Jetta) because of the simplicity of it's interior - just gauges, shifter, radio, signals, and wipers, not something that came out of a futuristic spaceship.   I've spent most of my life in 90's and early 00's cars and don't like how cramped and closed off most new cars feel inside.   Gonna go to a VW dealer after I get off work tonight and see how I fit in both the Golf and Jetta. I test drove them both about a year ago and liked how I fit in them much better. I'm not a small guy, and I'm not a huge guy either.    I'm so torn on this whole thing and wish I'd not bought the car in the first place."
askcarsales,3bo8ed,skfoto,5,Tue Jun 30 20:26:57 2015 UTC,"Gonna go to a VW dealer after I get off work tonight and see how I fit in both the Golf and Jetta.   You're putting the cart before the horse. You'd better find out if you can get out of the Cruze deal before you start shopping for another car, especially on the last day of the month. If you go in there acting interested in a car and can't actually buy one you're going to make things unpleasant for everyone. Time is money when chasing a sales goal at the end of the month and if you're unable to complete the purchase right now they won't hesitate to get your ass out of the dealership as quickly as possible.  I do agree with you about the Cruze though, they always feel ""snug"" to me compared to other compacts."
askcarsales,3bo8ed,Way2evil,3,Tue Jun 30 20:33:53 2015 UTC,You could trade in the Cruze for a golf.
askcarsales,3bo8ed,Mnudge,2,Wed Jul 1 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"I recently drove a Cruze  and I was surprised at how nice it was.  I hadn't even been in a Chevy in ages and was really impressed with the vehicle.   I am a big guy and yes, it was cramped for me but as far as the engine, ride and tech, I was pretty happy.  Do what makes you happy but understand if you bail on the Cruze to get into a Golf you are going to take a big hit financially.   On top of that, despite the neat features of the Golf, it is still a VW and ranked 23rd in 2015 JD Power reliabity study while Chevy was #10.  If you are intersted in cost of ownership, which appears to be the case, I would caution you to slow down a bit"

askcarsales,3bo8jb,cpages231,4,Tue Jun 30 20:20:02 2015 UTC,"Please use the search function this is one of the most common questions we get.  Short answer is yes, you get a better deal, but not to nearly the extent you're probably picturing in your head.  Call it $500 or less better, between both cars, than buying each one individually a few months apart.  As for the loan it is 2 individual loans."
askcarsales,3bo8jb,rodion_kjd,2,Tue Jun 30 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"Two loans.  Mention that you need two, but concentrate on one at a time."
askcarsales,3bo8jb,Micosilver,2,Tue Jun 30 20:22:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, any dealership would prefer two sales over one. You won't be looking at a huge price difference though- this is such a volume-driven business that you should already be able to negotiate a rock-bottom discount even if you're just buying one car (unless it's a really high demand model). But it'll make the process a lot easier and faster and you're still likely to save a few bucks.   Treat it as two separate transactions though. Completely work out the first car deal and then move on to the second as they're getting the papers drawn up for the first one. If you try to do both at the same time it just makes things unnecessarily complicated for all parties.  You're going to get two separate car loans by the way."
askcarsales,3bo8jb,skfoto,2,Tue Jun 30 20:23:30 2015 UTC,"They would still both cost a certain amount for the dealer, so you might get a slight additional discount for purchasing another car at the same time. Don't expect thousands, it will more likely be tens or maybe hundreds of dollars."

askcarsales,3bnpy1,Goingtodieeventually,2,Tue Jun 30 19:08:11 2015 UTC,"I just bought a v6 mustang yesterday, there was one similar to your situation 600 miles, it had been returned because the guy lied about some information or something, and then the one I bought 380 miles brand new, not sure why so many miles, but I got It for 24320+TTL."
askcarsales,3bnpy1,skfoto,3,Tue Jun 30 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"What are they actually selling it for? $500 discount by itself isn't that great. $500 additional on top of a decent dealer discount is a different story altogether.

askcarsales,3bnpy1,mingucho,-11,Tue Jun 30 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"Go in at the end of the month and be willing to walk away from the car if they wont reasonably negotiate with you. Ask about what applicable rebates they have because that's how dealers can go below invoice on the car. Do you have payments they are eating? Cuz that can be another factor. It doesn't matter that it has 1k miles on it, 500 discount earns your business they would be happy to make some money off you. Ask ask ask ask and don't pay a single dealer fee!!!!"

Assuming you live at home since you have a cosigner and didn't mention any actual bills - you should be saving 2/3 per month, and spending roughly $100 per week discretionary. If you get a new mustang you won't even have the budget for gas or insurance, much less dates, food, etc.   You need at least $3-4k per mo realistically to get a car like that - unless your co-signer is going to split the costs down the middle with you - including oil changes, gas, tires, everything..."

A guy in his 20's driving a Mustang is about as high risk as it gets in the insurance business.  You are looking at a minimum $500 per month car payment + whatever an insurance company is going to jam you for.  The pleasure of owning this car will take almost every penny of your $1400 per month income (car pymt, insurance, gas, basic maintenance).  $3000 will get you a decent old Civic, Corolla, or similar."

Stick around until you can talk to someone who can help you; it may take some persistence.  Two things could have happened here. The bank may have counteroffered a 66 month loan for various reasons, age of the vehicle, your credit score, etc. If that's the case then the dealership was neglectful in failing to tell you what happened but there's not much you can do.  The other thing that could've happened is they made an innocent mistake. As long as the deal hasn't funded yet they may still be able to fix it. It'd be in their best interest to do that anyway, as all other things being the same (same bank, same rate, etc) the dealership will make slightly more money at the longer term. How long ago did this happen? If it's only been a few days you may still have a chance."

I can imagine the frustration that the sales manager will have.  What do you think of using Truecar app to scout out prices before going in the dealership? Do you think it's more effective doing the negotiation in person? There are a few incentives that are available via the app but I am a little hesitant on how accurate/effective the app is in terms of giving me the best price, etc."
askcarsales,3bp2sx,el_karacho,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:37:16 2015 UTC,"TrueCar has come to the point of KBB and Edmunds IMO.  They're a guide, but they do allow you to basically buy through their partnered dealers.  Fewer and fewer dealers are partnering with them, though, because they're making the process more difficult in that customers can build cars that don't exist and get angry when their certificate is pointless.  Still, as a guide, it can be good and can help in the negotiation process.  The TrueCar rebates, in my experience (only done about 3) are not tied to TrueCar partners, they can be applied anywhere."
askcarsales,3bp2sx,verdegrrl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:19:25 2015 UTC,"Does telling the dealership that I want to lease a car will give me less chance to negotiate?   You negotiate the same way with either. Cap cost = selling cost.   I am planning to custom order my corvette with my specific preferences and not just pick one off the lot. How will this affect my negotiation on the price of the car?   Generally the same. Dealer doesn't have to pay flooring on an order, but they do need more hand holding during the process. It comes out in the wash.   hould I be less picky and find one that is close to what I want?   You might have a tiny bit more wiggle room, but very little.  Leasing terms change month to month. So all you can do is agree to a certain amount over invoice and see where the chips fall with regards to incentives, money factors, and residuals when the car  arrives. The bank sets those, not the dealer.  Check out the corvette forums to find the best rates dealer and salesperson in your area."

Now, how to do this without being annoying... don't pretend you know what's good for him better than he does. Don't try to interject your opinions about anything (e.g. color).

Use AutoTrader Marketplace to find out what his trade is worth instead of whatever you looked at instead and use TrueCar to find pricing for the Highlander XLE AWD.

askcarsales,3bozx3,iamsynecdoche,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:49:09 2015 UTC,The 2015 you can finance up to 5 years at 0% and at 0.99% over 5.5 and 6 year terms. 1.99% after that.  The 2016 has 0% up to only 4 years and then rates start going up.  There's about 1000$ difference in cash price between the 2015 and 2016 so you can probably get some sort of rebate on the 2015 even if you're financing.  Mazda Canada mentions something about a 500$ rebate (offered on both model years) but you'll have to ask the dealer about it.  TLDR; Yes you can save some money by going with a 2015 depending on how long you intend to finance it for.
askcarsales,3bozx3,BigDoggie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:38:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks. We made the deal today, and I'm pretty happy with the price we ended up at. They did offer us a discount to get it off the lot, as well as offering a discounted ""loyalty"" interest rate."

Based on that information, you can go and make an educated offer.  Most dealers will accept a 3% markup, less any factory incentives.  I don't know for Mazda, but for Kia, the 15 and 16 Sportage have virtually the same price, but the 15 has $1000 off and 0% interest for 84 months, but the 16 has $0 off, and 1.99% for 84 months.

askcarsales,3bozx3,RexRaider,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:00:32 2015 UTC,Dealers won't compete with each other all that much.  You can see the margins they work with.  Most dealers will leave it up to you: come in and make us an offer based on what you know.
askcarsales,3bmqgi,epidemic,2,Tue Jun 30 13:50:38 2015 UTC,"Not screwed, but definitely not in a good position.   First off... do not replace the tires. The hit it's going to take in value is going to be equal to or less than the cost of the tires, so don't even bother.  You really only have three options. Keep the Nissan, come up with cash to cover the negative equity, or roll the negative equity into the payments on a new truck.  With your wife on the loan and the large amount of rebates that most new full size trucks carry right now you'll probably have a decent shot of getting approved even with the negative equity. Every dollar you can come up with toward a down payment will help you greatly. If you do get the new truck, buckle down and pay as much as you possibly can every month to bring the balance down. If you finance all this negative equity and then just let it ride for the duration of the loan you're going to be in just as bad of a position in a few years.  You're going to have a much easier time getting approved on a brand new truck vs. a used one due to the rebates, though a used truck may still be possible as long as it's one that's only a few years old and still has a really strong book value."
askcarsales,3bmqgi,skfoto,2,Tue Jun 30 14:24:14 2015 UTC,Great info. Thanks a ton. I was leaning the same way on the tires...scraped through the winter here in Colorado.  I need to have the  4D crew cab so I have room for carseats and the brand new full size crew cabs are sooooooo damn expensive. My ideal budget is around 27k and have around 4k for a down payment not including the trade in. Keeping the Nissan is not an option as some of my work is now in the mountains outside of Denver and need the power to pull a trailer if the need arises.  I have been eyeballing 2012 Chevy and GMCs with around  50k odometers.
askcarsales,3bmqgi,cubical_hell,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:54:40 2015 UTC,Your down payment eats most of your neg equity. You'll be fine with a strong cosigner. Go find a truck. Have proof of income and your cosigner ready.

I don't want to do that, and don't plan on driving it or leaving the lot.   If I have to, my back-up plan is to take the car and sell it myself."

askcarsales,3bmy73,el_karacho,6,Tue Jun 30 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"Are you 100% sure you won full ownership of the car?  If the cash value option is only $12k, you may have only won a 2-year lease on said Camaro.  Let's say that's not the case, though.  Here's what usually happens in these scenarios:  Casino runs promo with dealer.  Casino agrees to pay the dealer for the car on behalf of the prize winner.  Prize winner almost always pays tax on the car.  So in this scenario, the dealer gets a car sold AND probably receives invoice for the car, and a customer who will presumably take the car back there for servicing, so a potential revenue stream.  If they do what you propose, they'd just be taking the check from the casino, lopping a bit off the top, and giving you the remainder.  However, they would NOT be getting a sold unit, they would NOT be getting a future service customer, and they may be in breach of contract with the casino since they accepted a check from them for an item that was not delivered as agreed upon.  There's certainly a possibility that what you're trying to do may be totally kosher and the best way to maximize your winnings from the whole situation, but I tend to err on the side of caution.  Please update this thread as you go through the process, I'm very interested to see how this plays out.  What state, by the way?"

I totally understand that my proposal has a lot of gray area, but it does have the max potential for me and still benefits the dealer a bit.  Realistically, I will probably end up taking the car and having to sell it privately.... but I have never gotten a few extra by being passive, so we will see!"

You can probably buy a brand new, untitled $24,700 Camero for $23,000 so they'll need to have it priced around $20,000 to make someone look at it vs another car.  2nd owner, titled, etc all adds to the ultimate depreciation on the car."

Your price is generally less than what the dealer will have to pay.    Not sure why the payoff is less than remaining payment.  Your best bet is to call them and ask them for the numbers for the various scenarios.  In a nut shell, you owe them residual plus the remaining payments if you're buying it.  Probably a grand or two more than that for a dealer to buy it, but that varies based on Ally's mood or the particular contract you signed.  All that matters is what the trade-in value is compared to the buy-out.  Sometimes the low miles will help you out.  Just depends on all the specifics."

askcarsales,3bo73t,Micosilver,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:48:06 2015 UTC,"From what I researched I keep seeing some people say I am only responsable for the remaining payments on lease term, others say its remaining payments + residual value and lastly some say its pay-off + Residual value.   To end the lease right now you'd just pay the remaining payments plus any damage/mileage charges plus any applicable fees (read your contract). Sounds like you're well under mileage though. In this case you'd turn the car in at the Chevy dealer and then go buy your Porsche.  To trade the car in you'll be responsible for the remaining payments PLUS the ""dealer buyout"" price, which may be different than the residual. Call the leasing company and ask what it'd cost you to end the lease if you're trading in the car. Be very clear about what you're doing as the buyout price for personal use and buyout price for trade-in are different. You will not be responsible for any mileage or damage charges but there may be a fee involved (once again, read your contract).   Also do I get any value in keeping my miles so low? Meaning I am allowed 10K a year and I have not even used 8K in 1.5 years.   Nope, you paid for those miles up front and they're non-refundable. The only benefit to you is increased trade-in value due to having low mileage.   Are there also any bargaining tactics I can use on the trade in to help with pay off + residual or do I just have to throw money at it?   The charges to pay off the car with the leasing company are non-negotiable. Standard tactics apply for getting the most out of your trade-in though (read the FAQs)."

askcarsales,3bl6vd,TackyWacky6969,7,Tue Jun 30 03:03:15 2015 UTC,"A lease is if you know you can afford monthly payments on a nice car but something you don't see yourself in long term or it has expensive maintenance in my eyes. Example, a BMW 5-series is something that is attainable for any middle class american if they lease it. If it breaks down (and you didn't cause it) they don't have to worry about it because all maintenance is provided for by leasing company and when they trade it in most dealers will already give you many incentives to keep on leasing. However most leases can't be modified. These ""incentives"" are made so that you keep paying money for borrowing these cars, netting you 0 return on your investment besides being able to get from point a to point b. If you own a car you have the decision to sell it even if it's at a loss (unless you own a supra or an NSX), you don't pay continuous monthly payments with the trade off that all maintenance outside of warranty is paid for by the owner. You can modify any owned car however you damn well please (careful some might void your warranty). Leases also usually have a mileage limit (more mileage = higher monthly payments)  However, dealers will give you the option of buying the car you leased for an agreed upon price that is given at the beginning of the lease when you sign. This price is determined by many factors but mostly comes down to historical depreciation of the model. If this price is above market value, it is not worth it to buy the car; if it is way below then it can be worth it to buy it outright and maybe sell it, trade in for something nicer or just keep it if you really liked the car for good value!  I'm not a car salesman though, I'm just your regular average Joe so I might be wrong on some of this info :)"
askcarsales,3bl6vd,BadMofoWallet,3,Tue Jun 30 04:24:00 2015 UTC,With a lease you are paying it's depreciating value. At the end of your lease the car's value has decreased by roughly what you had paid. Therefore there is no equity. You return the car and are owed nothing.

askcarsales,3bl6vd,genuine_magnetbox,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"The point of leasing is to be able to drive something you (possibly/probably) couldn't afford otherwise.   an example using very general numbers:   To buy a $25,000 car over 60 months (with say a $3000 down payment) your payment will be at least $366/month ((25000-3000)/60). That is before taxes and whatever the interest adds to the price of the car. Let's call it $400/month. A $25,000 car is something like a Subaru WRX.   That same down payment of $3,000 + $400 a month will allow you to drive something like BMW 528i (I saw one in a local add to confirm), which is nearly a $50,000 car. That is the benefit of leasing: being able to drive a brand new $50,000 car for the costs of a buying a $25,000 car."

No, the point of leasing is to have a liability rather than a depreciating asset.  For consumers, it gives the flexibility of options at the termination.  If you're leasing a car you otherwise ""couldn't afford"", you're doing it wrong and are probably going to wind up in trouble. If you can't afford to buy a car, you can't afford to lease it."
askcarsales,3bl6vd,cbessemer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"That's not quite accurate. a 528i currently leases for $449, and that doesn't include tax.  So in most states it would be around $500. Plus it is $4244 due at signing ($3000 down doesn't include other up front costs) plus taxes due at signing.   Your basic point is correct, but your example is on a car that is much more expensive.  Usually you can get about $10k more car for the same monthly payment."
askcarsales,3bl6vd,juaquin,2,Tue Jun 30 17:55:31 2015 UTC,"The most cost effective option is always to buy the car and run it into the ground. However, if you are going to upgrade every 3 years anyways (which is not frugal at all), then sometimes the lease can be a better ""deal"". Depends on the price, the car, promotions, and resale value when you sell it.  The only way to know for sure is to run the numbers for the specific car and deal you're looking at, and even then, you have to guess at what the resale value will be. Mustang's historically do not tend to hold their value very well, for instance - but that could change with the newest generation."

That's the main drawback with leasing. There is typically no equity for you to ""use as downpayment for a newer car."" With most deals you are left with nothing when the lease term expires.   If you have owned a series of cars, and nursed a little dollop of equity from car to car as you flip/trade them so you always have a down payment on the next vehicle, and then switch to a lease deal, you lose that equity."
askcarsales,3bl6vd,sharpescreek,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:49:33 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, it's more expensive to lease than to buy if you look purely at the amount of money paid for the vehicle over a set period of time. There are instances where incentives and specials by the manufacturer close the gap.  You can usually buy the vehicle for less than the lease price and you can often sell the vehicle for more than the residual. Add to that the fees associated with leasing and it will usually be more expensive than buying.  That's not to say that leasing isn't a great deal. As BadMofoWallet says, you can drive a much nicer vehicle if you lease versus if you buy."
askcarsales,3bl6vd,TheRealMeatloaf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:21:41 2015 UTC,I generally recommend that people lease new cars and buy used ones unless they are very high mileage drivers.
askcarsales,3bl6vd,duffman13jws,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:27:54 2015 UTC,"Depends how high.  If a high mileage driver takes a 60-72 month loan, they'll be in an almost perpetual negative equity situation, forever rolling negative into their next loan (which will invariably creep up to 84 or 96 months to keep the payments manageable) whereas a person who builds their expected usage into their lease can walk away clean every 36-48 months and into a fresh lease with no carry over."
askcarsales,3bl6vd,Micosilver,0,Tue Jun 30 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"Leasing is better than buying if you're a habitual car flipper, or are using the car for business purposes.  You're only paying depreciation on the car, and the value at the end of the lease (residual) is pre-set by the manufacturer/leasing company, which are sometimes artificially inflated to lower payments and move extra metal.  Consider this:  You can lease a BMW 328i for $329 per month for 36 months. $4,124 due at signing.  You are paying down the lease payment approximately $115/month with the signing part but consider the payment - that's $444/month to drive a roughly $45,000 car for 3 years at 10,000 miles a year.  For comparison, I bought a Mazda 3 in 2010 with 0 down at 0% and my payment on a 60 month loan was $377.  With those same terms to own the BMW you'd be paying $750 a month.  I mention business purposes earlier because since you're only paying depreciation with a lease, you're essentially able to write-off the entire payment as you can write off depreciation on capital assets like a vehicle used for business purposes.  I have an uncle who owns a chain of pharmacies in NY who does this every 3 years with an A8L and basically drives the car for free."

The car has to be used for business purposes, and if you drive it from home to work - that is already not 100% business. Then, it doesn't look like you understand what a write-off is. If your uncle is paying $1000 a month for a car, and supposed he writes off 100% - he is paying taxes of his income minus $1000, so  if his tax rate is 40% - he is saving $400. Not $1000."

askcarsales,3blhcu,rodion_kjd,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:09:34 2015 UTC,"Replacing the compressor is likely going to cost a bit more than that.  The compressor went out in my 07 Rabbit and I got several quotes to replace it- the lowest was still $1300.  The problem is that the internals shred, sending metal shaving through the whole system.  You have to replace all of the lines, compressor, dryer, etc.  It's no small job."
askcarsales,3blhcu,theburnout,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:33:56 2015 UTC,Is this something that would help if I got it fixed right away? Like does this happen over time if I don't get it replaced?
askcarsales,3blhcu,theburnout,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:50:25 2015 UTC,"The new compressor will last somewhere between 2 weeks and a few months, then it'll die.  If you aren't going to do the whole system, don't do it."

askcarsales,3bls3d,Austiny1,2,Wed Jul 1 00:05:47 2015 UTC,Attention /u/hulieb: publishing your ignorance once is amusing. Twice is pathetic trolling.
askcarsales,3bls3d,HouseOfBull3209,2,Tue Jun 30 17:37:40 2015 UTC,"I got the same PM. My response before realizin they had already posted here before:  You might ask on /r/askcarsales as some Toyota sales people could tell you what kind of incentives are in place at this time.  Keep in mind that if it's a line item on the actual invoice such as delivery fee, special paint, sunroof, etc, you will have to pay for at least the invoice base rate for those items (there is often a small markup between invoice and retail). Different states allow dealers to charge different doc fees. Some are mandatory - so specify the state when you post to /r/askcarsales.  They also have a car buying FAQ in the sidebar."
askcarsales,3bls3d,verdegrrl,2,Tue Jun 30 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"I'd love to go shopping with you sometime.   ""Sir this apple is 84 cents.""  ""I have 50""  ""I'm sorry sir this costs 84 cents""  ""I read online it only costs you 60. Do you want to sell this apple or not? I have a 500 credit score and 50 cents you sleezy grocer.""  ""Sir I'm going to have to ask you to leave"""
askcarsales,3bls3d,WorkForBacon,3,Tue Jun 30 13:08:37 2015 UTC,"More like, I heard that I can ask for this apple at the cost you receive it as.  I understand you have to pay for many other factors, but I do not want to contribute to your profits. In fact, I have the right to ask for the apple at below the price you get it, because you are a charity."
askcarsales,3bls3d,sscall,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:27:30 2015 UTC,"Look, I don't care you imported this apple from Argentina. I believe it is worth 50 cents. You must sell it to me for this amount or I will throw a public fit"
askcarsales,3bls3d,WorkForBacon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:11:38 2015 UTC,FYI I just copy and pasted a PM I got from a redditor.
askcarsales,3bls3d,WorkForBacon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:27:23 2015 UTC,My bad. I bet shopping with you would be a stripper and coke fueled adventure.

askcarsales,3bls3d,Chxbeachva,2,Tue Jun 30 06:54:27 2015 UTC,ha!!! We mark up sunroofs 10grand. I'm leaving for a 3 month around the world resort vacation tomorrow because I sold so many sunroofs. They can sell the SE For 10 grand and I'm sure you can get a buy one get one free deal on the hybrid.  Also you don't have to pay tax it's a myth. Yeah actually they should pay YOU a doc fee. And last but not least bring your lawyer and you can get the SE for 9gs.
askcarsales,3bls3d,carmicdy,0,Tue Jun 30 12:40:01 2015 UTC,"True story:  We were advertising a 2 year One Pay lease for BMW i3 for $6,888, tax and title included. OBVIOUSLY, this was after all rebates, right?  I got a few phone calls from people that asked if they will receive the $7,500 tax credit after paying for the car $6,888 for two years."
askcarsales,3bls3d,HouseOfBull3209,5,Tue Jun 30 12:43:04 2015 UTC,"Thats $287 a month, that would be awesome.  edit: nvm I looked up the car fuck that shit."
askcarsales,3bls3d,-SoItGoes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:05:54 2015 UTC,Dealers usually net huge profits off special color paint and a sunroof.  God those dealers are just swimming in cash.
askcarsales,3bls3d,Micosilver,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:42:29 2015 UTC,"Why would anyone think dealers make money on the ""delivery?"""
askcarsales,3bls3d,HouseOfBull3209,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:00:38 2015 UTC,Because they read it on the internet.
