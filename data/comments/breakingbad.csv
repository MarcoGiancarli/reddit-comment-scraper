breakingbad,3duyuk,stuka444,19,Sun Jul 19 22:47:25 2015 UTC,You aren't confirming the actual event. You are confirming if the event is possible.
breakingbad,3duyuk,CourseHeroRyan,2,Mon Jul 20 04:55:34 2015 UTC,That's what plausible means. Confirmed means it did happen whereas plausible means it could have happened
breakingbad,3duyuk,a-Centauri,3,Mon Jul 20 13:23:40 2015 UTC,"Plausible means the myth is unlikely to happen as stated. It's about the myth, not it actually happening.   Half the myths are movie myths, they aren't trying to confirm the events happened in real life, just if the myth is possible or not."
breakingbad,3duyuk,CourseHeroRyan,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:00 2015 UTC,"plau·si·ble: (of an argument or statement) seeming reasonable or probable  And a [wiki excerpt:]()   Plausible   Plausible is given under a few circumstances:  *The myth's results can only be replicated by expanding some parameters of the myth by a realistic and reasonable margin. This may have been due to facts of the myth having been altered slightly over time by it being told and re-told by the time it was tested by the MythBusters. Also, certain materials may have had to be substituted for others in some cases as a matter of necessity during the course of the myth being tested, but the new materials are almost always very similar to the materials specified and usually are readily available, so as to prevent it from being prohibitively costly or impractical.  *If there is no documentation of the myth occurring, yet the MythBusters were still able to duplicate it very closely to how the myth was described (such as the myth that pirates wore eye patches in order to keep their night vision, or an untrained pilot being talked through landing an airplane).If the myth's results are achieved using the method described, but the underlying reason is different from the one described in the myth (such as in the myth of throwing a fire extinguisher into a fire to make it explode and extinguish the fire).  *If it requires a highly improbable set of circumstances, yet is shown to be possible under similar yet artificial circumstances. For example, in the myth of ""Can two colliding bullets fuse together?"" it was shown that two bullets can fuse together but would be exceedingly difficult to actually get two period guns with period ammunition to collide in the correct way to cause the result. The results can be created in a similar laboratory setting, but the chances of the myth actually happening as described are remote.If the results stated in the myth are attainable, but in such a way as to make the process either highly dangerous or less efficient than more common methods of achieving the same result. For example, in ""Car vs. Rain"", the MythBusters declared the myth ""Plausible (but not recommended)"", due to the danger in driving a car at high speeds on a wet road even though the myth was completely true.[29]  *If a positive result is attained using surrogates for living creatures, but the procedure would result in injury or death if an actual creature was tested. For example, in ""MythBusters Holiday Special"", two ballistics gel replicas of pet dogs were used to test the myth that a falling frozen turkey would crush a household pet; both replicas sustained serious injuries, as determined by a veterinarian, and the myth was dubbed ""Plausible"", as the Build Team was unwilling to test the myth on actual pets.  *Occasionally, a myth will be labelled plausible if the described scenario produces a result similar to, but of less intensity than, the one described in the myth."

breakingbad,3duyuk,Combatthewombat,16,Sun Jul 19 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"Looking at YouTube videos of said magnets, it appears they can only hold a handful of scrap metal at a time and only affect things within a foot of the plate at most. Of course, we don't know how much energy is being applied to the electromagnet, and we saw, what - 8 car batteries wired up to power the thing? I'm no scientist so I don't know how much electricity they can put out and if that could power the magnet sufficiently.   I don't think the scene where Jessie holds the laptop and it's pulled 12 feet across the air to the truck is realistic - but I do have a feeling that it might pull some shelves over through a wall (not sure about it going through the car and the wall though). Nor do I think it would scramble the laptop hard drive from that distance.   But its still an interesting myth to bust, and I wanna see them do it."

breakingbad,3dsnh1,nightpanda893,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:20:32 2015 UTC,Haha! That's cool. Me too. I guess it is just popular. In this thread I saw like five of them. I guess it's tough to be original with a fanbase of millions!
breakingbad,3dsnh1,McBurger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:28 2015 UTC,Sorry for the potato quality...  Edit: New gif  New and improved version.

breakingbad,3dsnh1,catfayce,10,Sun Jul 19 12:08:31 2015 UTC,This video was such a tease.
breakingbad,3dsnh1,LackOfABetterNombre,26,Sun Jul 19 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"I did find and watch this  But, there's only two myths tested, Hydroflouric acid in a bathtub, and mercury fulminate thrown at the floor. Both from season 1.. So.. I guess perhaps there's another episode? Good watch on this one anyway."
breakingbad,3dsnh1,GRIMshadow,7,Sun Jul 19 06:43:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I think this is an older episode of Mythbusters.
breakingbad,3dsnh1,SC275,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:07:22 2015 UTC,"They screwed up both tests on a fundamental level.  They censor it, but they use aqua regia, which is H2SO4 and HCL. It does not react the same ways as hydrofluoric in a lot of cases.  For example, HF etches glass, but does nothing to gold.  The mythbuster blend is the opposite; it melts gold but does nothing to glass.  It's all about 'reduction potentials' and not how 'strong' it is. Besides glass and most metals, HF also does different work on flesh than sulfuric or HCL.  As for the fulminate, they use a powdered version, and not big crystals like the show.  Powders are more stable, and would be more likely to disperse the energy of an impact without detonating.  Not sure either would work if they were faithful enough, but I think there hands were pretty much tied. They mention it being difficult to get crystallized forms."

You even can move one with the other through a thick tableplate, so it's pretty realistic that the industrial magnet have enough power to get through the wall.  And because the is a counterforce, the magnet gets also pulled to the wall, leading to the tipping of the van."
breakingbad,3dsnh1,Gimperator,8,Mon Jul 20 11:18:18 2015 UTC,I stumbled across this episode last night on tv. I thought it was really badass

breakingbad,3dsnh1,GaroldWilsonSnailJr,4,Sun Jul 19 09:21:54 2015 UTC,What's so unrealistic about setting up a machine gun on a remote turret?
breakingbad,3dsnh1,StumpNuts,-10,Sun Jul 19 18:20:21 2015 UTC,I always thought this show was super corny. Especially when they use dummies for things that are not really dangerous at all.
breakingbad,3dsnh1,Brolympia,6,Sun Jul 19 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"Insurance company won't let them test many of the myths themselves, so they use the dummies. They've occasionally complained that they really wanted to test something when insurance said they couldn't."
breakingbad,3dsnh1,EireWench,-106,Sun Jul 19 18:38:21 2015 UTC,He says Walter was shot in the episode. I don't remember that. Anyone confirm that was seen on screen. The Breaking Bad Special had Gilligan making up things that we don't see on screen to explain why test went wrong (like the amount of chemical Jessie used in the bathtub).
breakingbad,3dsnh1,hopesdead,74,Sun Jul 19 04:56:35 2015 UTC,How else did he end up dieing before the cops showed up? In the very last frames of the finale walt touches his blood stain on his stomach and then pretty much falls.
breakingbad,3dsnh1,tauranamics,-30,Sun Jul 19 05:05:47 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I couldn't recall the details.

Now Walter white bleeding, wandering through a meth lab all woozy and falling lifeless to the ground can be considered more solid evidence of death."
breakingbad,3dsnh1,Nushuktan-Tulyiagby,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:49:27 2015 UTC,We saw him get stabbed in the stomach and disappear
breakingbad,3dsnh1,CobaltKnight,9,Sun Jul 19 09:12:25 2015 UTC,Walt was shot during thay scene.
breakingbad,3dsnh1,Can_I_Pikachu,14,Sun Jul 19 05:06:45 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS for the final episode of *Breaking Bad*  As Walt dives on top of Jesse to protect them both from the remote machine gun a bullet does hit Walt, you can see him grimace on impact. Furthermore, when Walt tells Jesse to shoot him and says that he wants it Jesse notices the blood welling on Walt's shirt. This accompanied by the bloody handprint on the meth vat nearing the final shot of the series concludes that Walt was shot/grazed by his own invention leaving viewers to posit if he seemingly destroyed himself or if the cancer finished him off.   Edit: Apparently I was too slow."
breakingbad,3dsnh1,xCJES,3,Sun Jul 19 05:09:56 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that he wasn't necessarily shot directly, but struck by shrapnel or a ricocheting bullet. He doesn't start the machine gun until he and Jesse are both well on the ground, and obviously the machine guns range of fire is much taller than their positions on the ground."
breakingbad,3dsnh1,mrfaceroll,8,Sun Jul 19 12:10:46 2015 UTC,"How do you think he died...? He just decided he wanted to die and falls down? You see him get shot, and then he shows the wound as he is walking."

breakingbad,3dskih,Magneto88,8,Sun Jul 19 10:10:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't, Gilligan has said on many occasions they purposely left Gus' background vague for the mystique it gave him. I have no doubt we'll learn about how Gus built Los Pollos Hermanos and his empire in BCS but I'm not sure we'll see anything about Chile."
breakingbad,3dskih,nightpanda893,2,Sun Jul 19 16:47:59 2015 UTC,The cool thing about breaking bad and better call saul is that they allow for stories that are largely independent from the main character. Like Mike's backstory in season 1 of BCS and even parts of Gus's story and Jesse's story in Breaking Bad. So hopefully we can learn more about Gus through Mike as BCS continues.

breakingbad,3dvbp2,xxProjectJxx,3,Mon Jul 20 02:57:41 2015 UTC,"I think Walter Jr.'s condition probably had a lot to do with him being a high school teacher.  Walt would have needed a job where he could be home enough to support his son.  As for why he's so unconfident, I think that has to do with a lot.  Not getting respect from anyone in his life, working jobs he knows are beneath him, and most importantly living every day regretting missed opportunity.  Wore him down after so many years."
breakingbad,3dvbp2,wayfarer_515_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:17:33 2015 UTC,"I had actually never thought of the Walter Jr. side of it before.  Ya, that would make perfect sense finding a job that would allow him to be home longer to take care of him.  I am rewatching the series right now and I had just watched the episode where they are first buying the house and you see Skylar pregnant with Jr. and Walt was still confident in himself in that scene, but I'm guessing when Jr. was born was the start of a turning point for him."
breakingbad,3dr5js,VISSERMANSVRIEND,733,Sat Jul 18 17:39:18 2015 UTC,I never started to hate Walt. It's weird but even though I fully realized he was no longer acting out of care for his family but greed I still wanted him to survive and escape.

breakingbad,3dr5js,exaltedbladder,31,Sat Jul 18 20:59:35 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think it's because Bryan Cranston is such a great actor and somehow he managed to make Walt likable even after it was obvious what a bad guy he was.
breakingbad,3dr5js,TwinSwords,3,Sat Jul 18 20:55:25 2015 UTC,Same.

breakingbad,3dr5js,Lington,53,Sat Jul 18 18:11:04 2015 UTC,For me I think it was a bit like I knew Walt had spent most of his life being fucked over and finally had the power to do something about it. He'd been bullied by life but finally had the strength to stand up and bash life round the face with a stick made out of pork pie hats and laboratory glassware.

breakingbad,3dr5js,cant_read_this,25,Sat Jul 18 22:29:16 2015 UTC,It's not weird.  He's a fictional character in a fictional story.  Just because he's displays bad morals doesn't mean your a bad person for rooting for his wild ride.  Same as running over pedestrians in GTA doesn't automatically make you a sociopath.
breakingbad,3dr5js,Rswany,6,Sat Jul 18 19:48:52 2015 UTC,I just meant weird as in I assumed most people did start to hate Walt at some point.
breakingbad,3dr5js,CrystalMethEnema,2,Sat Jul 18 19:50:32 2015 UTC,Ditto. Was very upset when he didn't escape the end.
breakingbad,3dr5js,RazorJ,7,Sat Jul 18 21:29:49 2015 UTC,They did a really good job of humanizing him again in the last two episodes.  I didn't think I was ever going to feel sympathetic towards him again but they pulled it off.
breakingbad,3dr5js,druuconian,4,Sat Jul 18 18:57:12 2015 UTC,Yup I feel the same and I also rooted for Light in Death Note.  Am I evil?
breakingbad,3dr5js,DawsonJBailey,2,Sat Jul 18 23:53:42 2015 UTC,I think one of the reasons this show was so great was that it got me to side with Walt even when he was doing horrible things.
breakingbad,3dr5js,_maynard,2,Sun Jul 19 02:59:49 2015 UTC,I did too. It sucked that he died.
breakingbad,3dr5js,BobbyGzman,2,Sun Jul 19 06:11:22 2015 UTC,"A little late this thread, but I was glad to see your comment on top of this post, because that's exactly how I feel. I never stopped rooting for Walt."
breakingbad,3dr5js,SWATZombies,42,Sun Jul 19 06:54:02 2015 UTC,"Gale bothered me, but it was a situation where it really was either him or Walt.  It's hard to hate someone for trying to save himself at the cost of one man's (a man with no family and questionable morality) life.  Killing Gale bought him time, it wasn't a killing just for the sake of killing.  It was wrong, but somewhat understandable.  I don't think I ever truly hated Walt, but if I did it was because he was stupid.  It was the same situation as Tony Montana; he could have easily slipped into a role that would have given him a healthy cash flow and a relatively safe life, but he kept wanting more and it eventually burned him down- taking a lot of good men with him (Gomez, Hank, etc.) and probably scarring his kids for life.  All because he missed out on Gray Matter.  He came across as a petulant child trying to win an argument with nobody in particular, and that's pretty pathetic in my eyes."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Bearrunner44,10,Sat Jul 18 18:11:17 2015 UTC,"There was that beat before he had Gale killed where he seemed like he was actually selling out Jesse -- that seemed to cross the line for me.  But when it turned out he was signalling Jesse to kill Gale, somehow made it less bad.  Because he was protecting the team."
breakingbad,3dr5js,dystopika,4,Sat Jul 18 18:57:22 2015 UTC,When could he have slipped into a comfortable position with a healthy cash flow and relatively safe life?
breakingbad,3dr5js,Boerontosaurus,12,Sat Jul 18 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"Cooking for Fring, being quiet and taking orders, not making waves and being a loyal lackey. But he couldn't stand not being #1."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Darth_Squid,14,Sun Jul 19 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, after the train heist. He could have gotten out of the business at the same time Mike and Jesse wanted to. Between the money from selling the methylamine, the money he had already made, and the legitimate income from the car wash he could have lived a very comfy life."
breakingbad,3dr5js,OmniscientOctopode,2,Sun Jul 19 01:45:35 2015 UTC,He would have had to fuck Jesse over to pull that off.
breakingbad,3dr5js,Boerontosaurus,2,Sun Jul 19 16:18:42 2015 UTC,Accepting the job with Grey Matter!
breakingbad,3dr5js,hilarymeggin,2,Sun Jul 19 06:31:25 2015 UTC,"That's cheating, I mean a way he could lay low and make money off meth. Not, how can we end the show in the first season? Lol"
breakingbad,3dr5js,Boerontosaurus,3,Sun Jul 19 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"Even worse, he had Jesse do it. I know logistically with that particular situation Walt couldn't do it himself but if I recall correctly that was Jesse's first kill and it wrecked him for a long long time. Poor Jesse."
breakingbad,3dr5js,AnorexicManatee,205,Sun Jul 19 03:12:28 2015 UTC,Walt killing Mike is what did it for me
breakingbad,3dr5js,SyndromeOfADown420,64,Sat Jul 18 18:07:17 2015 UTC,"I was really upset about that, and it's been on my mind a bit recently. For a long time, I was upset that he did that because it felt almost like lazy writing to me. But I realized, it's actually pretty realistic, because in real life people do stupid things when they're mad. It's not lazy writing at all, because it still really humanizes walt's character."
breakingbad,3dr5js,SpcAgentOrange,45,Sat Jul 18 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this was ""Say my name!""/""You're goddamned right"" Walt we're talking about. His ego is the size of Jupiter at this point and Mike is punching little holes in it at every turn in his self-assured sardonic way. Eventually, Walt's ego couldn't handle it anymore and he snapped."
breakingbad,3dr5js,rphillip,20,Sat Jul 18 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"The part where he said he could've gotten the names from Lydia really stung. That made me realize he really is a monster. Mike is sitting there dying and Walt is just like oh shucks, I didn't have to kill you after all. Oh well! The fact that THAT was what Walt was thinking about after he just killed a good man really disturbed me and it made me feel like that scene was necessary."
breakingbad,3dr5js,AnorexicManatee,11,Sun Jul 19 03:03:35 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't think of a single scene in this show not necessary.... Well, maybe the shoplifting storyline."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Swankified_Tristan,11,Sun Jul 19 03:35:16 2015 UTC,That was necessary to me. It helps you understand what makes you not like a person. At first everyone HATES Marie (I mean I still don't like her) but shoplifting is the very least bad thing someone in that show has done.
breakingbad,3dr5js,SpcAgentOrange,7,Sun Jul 19 04:59:14 2015 UTC,"I think that storyline establishes how seriously Skyler takes crime, thus setting up her reactions to Walt down the line."
breakingbad,3dr5js,danthaman15,7,Sun Jul 19 05:39:48 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, killing Mike made perfect sense. Sure Mike was a good guy but remember he almost killed Walt and it's just ""business.""  In addition he knew he didn't want to have to keep paying all those dudes and if he killed them he didn't want Mike out there somewhere with the ability to kill him at any time. Not lazy writing just forward planning that Walt was so good about."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Soneca,2,Sat Jul 18 23:28:04 2015 UTC,"Mike was just as much a monster as anyone else in the story. But Walt did kill him in an egotistical rage, not out of calculation over Mike's potential threat.  Forward thinking was never Walt's forte, his one skill was improvisation to get himself out of whatever mess his lack of foresight had gotten him into this time. Every problem he had was his own creation."
breakingbad,3dr5js,JimmyHavok,4,Sun Jul 19 09:57:41 2015 UTC,Same here
breakingbad,3dr5js,FiftysevenLockup,5,Sat Jul 18 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"Oh man that is the only time I've sobbed whilst watching a series. I loved Mike so much, that cut me deep!"
breakingbad,3dr5js,nashbagxo,9,Sat Jul 18 20:34:02 2015 UTC,Shut the fuck up and let me die in peace..
breakingbad,3dr5js,Estivenrex18,41,Sun Jul 19 02:14:05 2015 UTC,"Never, I feel like I'm an awful person"
breakingbad,3dr5js,Ballnight,13,Sat Jul 18 17:56:22 2015 UTC,"I never changed my mind on Walt. None of the things listed here bother me. Jane was going to cause Jesse to die from all the drugs, reviving her would be same as killing Jesse. Mike was a bad guy, I can't feel sorry for him. Gale's death was basically self defence, because otherwise both Jesse and Walt were doomed.  Walt got into drugs and then things escalated. That's how he endangered his family, and it made him a bad guy, but if you excuse him making drugs for very first time, I think everything else is justifiable."
breakingbad,3dr5js,bobthebobd,7,Sat Jul 18 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Mike was a bad guy, yet nobody else in this thread seems to think so"
breakingbad,3dr5js,finnigan1671,3,Sat Jul 18 23:32:36 2015 UTC,"He did have chances to get out, though.  Does ""everything else"" also include ""I watched Jane die"" and trying to rape Skyler?"
breakingbad,3dr5js,DabuSurvivor,69,Sun Jul 19 06:10:24 2015 UTC,Maybe when he drunkenly told Hank that maybe Heisenberg was still out there.
breakingbad,3dr5js,sulaymanf,44,Sat Jul 18 18:13:12 2015 UTC,"Or around the same time, when he kept telling Walt Jr. to keep drinking."
breakingbad,3dr5js,HAL9000000,20,Sat Jul 18 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"that was season 2, when he told Hank about Heisenberg that was season 4"
breakingbad,3dr5js,methamphetaminee,36,Sat Jul 18 21:21:12 2015 UTC,"When Brock had been poisoned, the scene ended with Walt happy and saying ""we won,"" and then the camera panning to the flowers, signaling he was the one that poisoned him. Though I still rooted for him through the end of the series, that was the moment where I thought he had completely crossed over into someone horrific. He was willing to hurt or kill the innocent and defenseless- and a kid!- as his strategic pawns for his motives.   Edit: Brock. Damn autocorrect!"
breakingbad,3dr5js,LebronsHairline,7,Sat Jul 18 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"*Brock, but this was definitely a big turning point.  I had grown sort of... distrustful of him by this point in my first watch-through, but this sent it over the edge."
breakingbad,3dr5js,eflemingo17,2,Sat Jul 18 21:30:23 2015 UTC,"It didn't bother me, in fact it made me like Walt more.  He was able to manipulate Jesse into a situation that saved Walt's and his family's (and arguably Jesse's) lives and did it in a way so that Brock would not be hurt long-term by it."
breakingbad,3dr5js,SleestakLightning,16,Sun Jul 19 07:30:35 2015 UTC,"When he wouldn't just shut up and work for Gus. He had the best thing going for him, but then he got a boner for power and just had to fuck it all up."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Meatloaf-of-Darkness,31,Sat Jul 18 22:02:32 2015 UTC,"Re watching it.  When he confronts Jesse over the $1000 lost when the Junkies stole from Skinny Pete.  His greed and what he pushes Jesse to do.  Jesse has the right attitude telling Walt you got $15000 more than you had last week, don't be greedy.  I realized now that Walt is not a good person early on."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Decolater,10,Sat Jul 18 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"It's always the money. For me I started to hate him when I realised that his former business partners had offered to pay for his treatment and that he had refused.  Yes, they screwed him over in the past but he was willing to risk his entire family, all for his own wounded pride."
breakingbad,3dr5js,untogethered,3,Sun Jul 19 04:06:24 2015 UTC,But did they screw him or did he screw himself?  I just watched the episode.  Did he walk away from it?
breakingbad,3dr5js,Decolater,6,Sun Jul 19 04:23:08 2015 UTC,IIRC in the end it's implied that he screwed himself over. He walked away for personal (romantic) reasons.
breakingbad,3dr5js,untogethered,5,Sun Jul 19 04:51:05 2015 UTC,"Walt is logical, more than Jesse at least. He just expects too much sometimes."
breakingbad,3dr5js,DyJoGu,5,Sun Jul 19 02:38:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree entirely, it was like he said in that episode ”what happens when people find out Jesse Pinkman (drug lord) can be robbed with impunity?” Jesse even tried to give him $1,000 of his own money Walt didn't want it, that wasn't the point.  And the you have x amount of dollars you didn't have yesterday argument is stupid. What if the next time you open up your paycheck your pay is for 10 hours less than you worked? You still have more money than the day before right?"
breakingbad,3dr5js,tempromatic,3,Sun Jul 19 04:42:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting...but not the same.  Jesse understands the cost to get that extra 2k back.  It's like pennies based on what he knows will be coming in.  The principle of the thing is what gets people killed.  Jesse understands that.  If you act on principle it will get you know where, just like Tucco, and all the rest.  Let it slide and you have 15k and no blood on your hands.  Even if your a badass they still come after you.  Look what the cartel did to Gus.  I think Jesse understood that early on.  Get what you can while you can and remain above that killing stuff.  I see Jesse's point.  I see Walt's too, but Walt does it for greed and respect, which Jesse does not value the same way."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Decolater,14,Sun Jul 19 05:15:16 2015 UTC,probay a debateable point as to where it happens in the show but any of the times he could have quit when he was well and ahead.  Wouldn't have made for an exciting show if he just played it super smart though.
breakingbad,3dr5js,thedizzle11,14,Sat Jul 18 17:48:30 2015 UTC,My first run of the series I didn't hate him until Ozymandias. Currently on my second watch and I already hate him by season 2
breakingbad,3dr5js,masonrb500,114,Sat Jul 18 19:16:07 2015 UTC,When he let Jane die.
breakingbad,3dr5js,klsi832,22,Sat Jul 18 18:03:57 2015 UTC,"You see, he was actually torn as to whether or not he should do it and he even cried. But he realized that she was a threat by knowing about Walt and needed to be dealt with. Besides she was manipulating Jesse. The part that made me hate Walt was when he gave Jesse to the nazis and then rubbed it in to him that he let her die. That was pure evil coming out because once a family member died, all hope is lost."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Soneca,5,Sat Jul 18 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"True story, he did apologize about it in Fly and say he wished he had died before he went over there. But at the time, I hated him for it."
breakingbad,3dr5js,klsi832,3,Sun Jul 19 00:04:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was just that she was a threat to him. It came right after the whole ""Never give up on family"" talk with Donald. For Walt, not giving up on ""family"" (Jesse) means playing God and deciding you can kill someone else's daughter to save your own surrogate son from making what you see as bad decisions."
breakingbad,3dr5js,DabuSurvivor,17,Sun Jul 19 06:09:18 2015 UTC,"This was the moment for me too. I really liked Jesse and Jane's interactions and was rooting for them to run away together.    Walt rolling her on her back then letting her choke to death completely changed my feelings for him. After that, I wanted nothing more than for Jesse to kill Walt."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Quietus42,13,Sat Jul 18 21:41:13 2015 UTC,"He didn't roll her. She rolled on her own, and he just didn't stop it.  Edit: Nevermind, he did indirectly roll her. I never noticed it before..."

breakingbad,3dr5js,LikeAChikaCherryCola,6,Sat Jul 18 20:25:31 2015 UTC,Why? Was that the moment he seemed really dedicated?  Or did you just hate Jane?
breakingbad,3dr5js,sealifelover5,6,Sun Jul 19 00:33:13 2015 UTC,"For me it was because it was evil, and I respect badasses who fuck shit up for fun. I love murder in tv as well"

He let Jane die because he knew she was bad for Jesse. Part of it was selfish because he needed Jesse, but I'm sure he also cared for Jesse as well."
breakingbad,3dr5js,SleestakLightning,4,Sun Jul 19 07:13:20 2015 UTC,"Me too! I've never come to hate Walt, not even dislike him, I like evil, a few scenes in this show got me grinning, like somewhat impressed by how much Walt does to defend himself, to get what he wants, I like it. Yeah I'm a pretty bad person but I like being bad too"
breakingbad,3dr5js,Sozaiix3,10,Sun Jul 19 01:33:25 2015 UTC,ditto for me

breakingbad,3dr5js,BlueFalcon89,81,Sat Jul 18 21:49:16 2015 UTC,"I think it was around the time he blew up the challenger instead of returning it.

breakingbad,3dr5js,qi1,22,Sun Jul 19 02:47:48 2015 UTC,When he made Junior drink until he threw up.  I hate people who are not happy unless someone else is unhappy.
breakingbad,3dr5js,sacramentalist,12,Sat Jul 18 20:30:21 2015 UTC,When he took Holly.  Seeing Skylar scream and chase after him was brutal.
breakingbad,3dr5js,mikehoncho99,7,Sat Jul 18 21:00:45 2015 UTC,That whole episode was fucking brutal.
breakingbad,3dr5js,Swankified_Tristan,22,Sun Jul 19 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"Almost immediately. His general attitude never sat well with me. Particularly the way he treated Jesse throughout. There's rarely a time where he's not manipulating everyone around him.  I think a lot of people just think Walt is a badass. And that's fair, he does a lot of cool stuff during the series. But just as a human being, I couldn't stand him from the get-go."
breakingbad,3dr5js,kyledouglas521,12,Sat Jul 18 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"Yes!  He was so selfish at the beginning - if he could have just accepted a little help from his friends, he could have been so much happier."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Rosindust89,46,Sun Jul 19 00:11:25 2015 UTC,"Second watch through.  I mean, there's still something about it, I can't help but root for him, but watching it again you realize that Skylar's an amazing wife and mother who just wants to take care of her family, and Walt doesn't give a fuck and is willing to risk her life and her children's lives for his own selfish motivations."
breakingbad,3dr5js,greasywiener,26,Sat Jul 18 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"This is how I feel too.... I hated Skyler the first time around. The second time around, I am understanding her point of view a little better... just wanting to do what's best for the family... keep them safe."

breakingbad,3dr5js,rhinowing,12,Sat Jul 18 17:56:20 2015 UTC,It was very early on. He was just so ignorant to how drug dealing went. The kicker for me was when they were just starting up. Jesse spent all night hustling his ass off and made like $600. But Walt wasn't happy and got all pissed off yelling at Jesse being totally unaprecciative. He didn't understand you don't randomly just have connects to sell weight too
breakingbad,3dr5js,GrapeRello,3,Sat Jul 18 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"Well, to be honest, the average non-consumer of illicit products has no idea how this stuff goes. It's a bit like hating on a guy who can't program a calculator because he never learned a language."

breakingbad,3dr5js,-Teekey-,4,Sat Jul 18 19:20:19 2015 UTC,"I never really hated him.   But, there is an interesting article somewhere that explained that by the time they decided to go on for a 5th season, there were all sort of pressures to make the public stop choosing Walter's side. You can see how they drifted towards making him hateful, starting on the very first chapter of season 5 (""Shall we vote?"".. ""why?"" etc)  There was a great deal of followers by then, the series had become a cult, and.. well.. he is a man that decided to sell Metamphetamine to make things right in his life.  That's a message that can't go (so) mainstream."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Nemodin,8,Sat Jul 18 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"Like, I get it was to save their lives, but having Jessie kill Gale is what did it for me. Like, not only was Gale just a swell guy that didn't deserve it, but putting that burden on Jessie and fucking him up psychologically was an awful thing to do too."
breakingbad,3dr5js,Regitoss,16,Sat Jul 18 17:56:48 2015 UTC,His continous psychological abuse of Jesse was the thing for me - the worst kind of 'father' he could be to him.  A great moment from Jesse in the end when he finally fronts up on it...

I know Walt was still just trying to leave behind money for his family, and that he was still new to the drug business, but his arrogance  in that scene just struck a nerve. Jesse was doing all the work trying to sell, Walt knew jack shit about the business, and yet he's still just chewing Jesse out for something he had no control over. To me, it symbolized a beginning of a period where Walt was never again going to take responsibility for most of his actions. From here on out, all problems were other people's  fault."

Walt was dying and didn't want to go back on the run; he'd spent six lonely months in hiding.

It looks like the sign was cut by hand with scissors, which means it probably wouldn't be cut very straight. If it was photoshopped, it would be much easier to make it straight than lopsided. It would also be much faster and easier to make an actual sign and tape it to the door than to photoshop a fake sign."

breakingbad,3dkbj1,jenacious,21,Fri Jul 17 02:15:33 2015 UTC,"Nah this is why.  tldr: everybody hates fat chicks.  That and she fucked Ted.  /s  In all seriousness, in my opinion, she's the most human character on the show. She's an emotional mess that tries (and fails) repeatedly, never giving up. She makes hasty decisions, she has poor judgement, she's quick to anger, and she lacks objectivity.  People see themselves in her, and that scares them. Skylar is afraid of making the wrong decision and never strays outside of her comfort zone, whereas Walter is always taking big risks and trying to move forward regardless of the cost.  It's not that she's a buzzkill, but why she's a buzzkill -- she has some redeeming qualities and makes a few good decisions, but overall she's very easy to dislike. We can see her decision making thought process, and we are shown, step by excruciating step, how much damage she does. Watching her is like watching a car crash in slow motion.  Some of the things she's done are controversial but they end up being the right thing, but generally we're shown non-stop fuck-ups again and again.  If we saw Walter fail as much as Skylar does then nobody would watch the show, but instead we're overwhelmingly shown his victories. That contrast alone influences people's attitudes towards her very strongly, if not more than anything else."
breakingbad,3dkbj1,meowzah,9,Fri Jul 17 03:29:30 2015 UTC,"Essentially we like Walt because he succeeds at doing criminal activities, and we dislike Skyler because she fails at holding the moral high ground.  By the end of the 4th season I can't help but feel awful for her. Watching Walt and his family fall apart in the 5th season is almost equally tragic, though he does some cool stuff to try to make things right."
breakingbad,3dkbj1,sparklytomato,3,Fri Jul 17 12:02:28 2015 UTC,"With regards to Skyler's weight gain, the reason is because Anna Gunn was quite seriously ill and gained weight as a result of the medication she was required to take."
breakingbad,3dkbj1,aniforprez,2,Fri Jul 17 14:18:46 2015 UTC,I never even noticed any weight gain.  I guess I wasn't watching the show right.
breakingbad,3dkbj1,workerbee77,5,Fri Jul 17 16:59:21 2015 UTC,"I never noticed it either.  Probably because pregnant women gain weight?  Oh, and if it were ME who were in this situation, I'd frequently be sobbing in the bathtub with a 6 gallon tub of ice cream to dull the pain every night."
breakingbad,3dkbj1,aniforprez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"I figured the weight gain had to do with Skylar's weight gain too, never knew it was a real life problem!"

Although her transformation after the end of BB (and conquering her illness, thankfully) was pretty incredible.   I think it's pretty shitty whenever people mock her weight gain though, particularly considering the context."
breakingbad,3dkbj1,yndihalda1,12,Fri Jul 17 17:12:14 2015 UTC,I watched the entire show without any input from the Internet on whom to hate. Ofc I really connected with Skylar as a character who was caught in a horrible situation where she slowly lost the man she loved and ultimately gave up trying to get him back. Her cheating was bad but I kinda understand it.   Imagine my surprise after finishing the show to find the internet hating her guts. Oh anonymous people you...
breakingbad,3dkbj1,cth1ic_warrior,3,Fri Jul 17 06:43:41 2015 UTC,"Her cheating was bad   I don't even think so, in context.  It was a weapon she could use against Walt when they were at war."
breakingbad,3dkbj1,AFakeman,3,Fri Jul 17 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"I just meant morally. You know, marriage vows and shit. In context of the show though, she was alone, helpless and lost. I guess her cheating made her feel better."
breakingbad,3dkbj1,workerbee77,2,Fri Jul 17 16:01:01 2015 UTC,She was trying to divorce him and he was refusing. She kicked him out of the house for god's sake!

But it in his face it showed him be horrified, and want to help, but then confused because if he helped her, she may kill Jesse, but then ultimately lived with the decision of just leaving her there to die, and all of those thoughts rushed through my head in the matter of a few seconds when this scene was happening.

Walt finally checks the text message on his phone...and while breaking and entering, sweating, on his knees scrambling to collect meth and being surrounded by garbage Walt reads ""BABY COMING!!!"" and then he takes a moment to let it sink in--you can feel the devastation, it's palpable before he collects himself again and sprints out the door towards the deal.

breakingbad,3dlaqp,Hecubus114,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:33:25 2015 UTC,Walt was most definitely not a bad ass in the physical sense of the word. Every time he was in physical danger he was a cowering simp.   However he was one smart mothahfuckah (Hank Moody voice) and thought his way to millions and was willing to kill anyone to do what he wanted.
breakingbad,3dlaqp,2mobile2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:56:44 2015 UTC,Simple. Because he took a lot of risks. Calculated risks. Hes killed people. Hes went toe to toe (figuratively speaking) with dangerous people and came out on top in his own way. Sure hes not any good in a fist fight but he won his battles using his brain.
breakingbad,3dlaqp,Qawi9,-5,Sun Jul 19 03:27:52 2015 UTC,"I don't get why so many people think he built an empire or was a kingpin. He was just a cook. Once Gus was out of the picture, he had nothing."

How did he not run an empire? He had copious amounts of money in a warehouse while still already balling the fuck out."
breakingbad,3dlaqp,Diial,-5,Fri Jul 17 13:20:37 2015 UTC,He's Alpha as fuck. He doesn't give a shit about anything except his family. That's why he's such an asshole. But it also makes him badass.

breakingbad,3dlaqp,DabuSurvivor,0,Fri Jul 17 08:22:57 2015 UTC,How exactly? I haven't watched the show in a while so maybe that's where the confusion comes from.
breakingbad,3dlaqp,Somethingaboutboggle,3,Fri Jul 17 06:59:23 2015 UTC,He NEVER gave a shit about his family.  He used that as an excuse to fool himself to justify all the horrible shit he was doing.  He acted out of a desire to finally create something after living the last ~20 years as an underachiever.  The cancer woke him up and gave him a clicking down clock to do something.  His actions overcompensated for his low self esteem.
breakingbad,3dlaqp,malcontented,3,Fri Jul 17 15:00:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this except ""didn't give a shit about his family"".  I think his concern for his family was secondary to maintaining his reputation, which he was in denial about.  Hank dying opened his eyes to this, which is when he was finally able to admit his real motivations.  It didn't change his priorities, just made them clear."
breakingbad,3dlaqp,Hecubus114,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yes he cared about them but they were not the most important thing to him.  He lied(to himself and Skylar) when he said ""everything I do is for the family"".  At the end he finally admits this."

breakingbad,3dgwod,CaptainCfo,10,Thu Jul 16 04:28:38 2015 UTC,I think it had something to do with his nature in that he fixates on minor details. The fly in the lab episode is another good example of this. That was just my impression of it because I'm also a chemist and we tend to fixate on seemingly really small details in our work which is a trait that (for better or worse) sometimes leaks into life outside the lab.
breakingbad,3dgwod,chemicalcloud,9,Thu Jul 16 05:34:46 2015 UTC,"He was being diagnosed, and was in shock.  Hence the buzzing/ringing and attempt to distract himself."
breakingbad,3dgwod,thaneofpain,4,Thu Jul 16 07:57:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's the very beginning of his transformation to take control.  In the pillow episode he talks about how he feels like he never really had a say in any part of his life.  In that episode his desire to take control manifested in a decision to not undergo chemotherapy.  Later it would manifest in cooking meth.  At the earliest point, it was in telling a doctor to clean up his damn shirt.  It's a very very small thing to take control of, but the old Walt might have seen it and not said anything.  The fact that it's such a small thing he's fixated on changing just shows how passive and sad his life had been."
breakingbad,3dgwod,vonDriessen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"In Breaking Bad, the color yellow is associated with danger/meth.

breakingbad,3delnk,mojimorrow,31,Wed Jul 15 17:45:59 2015 UTC,"I think distributing is different than manufacturing. Gus' manufacturing began when Gale set up the lab, but he had probably been distributing the drugs for years via Los Pollos Hermanos."
breakingbad,3delnk,Thiswas_a_valued_rug,23,Wed Jul 15 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"This was pretty clear. Before Walt and Gus, correct me if I am wrong, he was dependent on the cartel for his product. However, his distribution was being built up between the events of Hermanos and the series."
breakingbad,3delnk,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,4,Wed Jul 15 18:08:18 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, I don't remember the show ever specifically showing us where Gus got his product before Walt. Maybe I'm forgetting.  But it makes sense that Gus was getting his product from the Cartel. That's why he orchestrated the shootout between Hank and The Cousins; lock up the border, continue using his own distribution system, and now also manufacture the drug to reap all the profits."
breakingbad,3delnk,Thiswas_a_valued_rug,2,Wed Jul 15 18:17:07 2015 UTC,See I was under the impression that the meth was cooked by the chemists Jesse demonstrated to off the original recipe by Gus and his partner in Hermanos.
breakingbad,3delnk,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,0,Wed Jul 15 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"My only problem with that theory is:   Back in the day, Gus was the businessman and his partner Max was the chemist. So when Tio Salamanca kills Max during that meeting by the pool, I'm not sure Gus would have been able to teach the cartel how to cook it.  Plus Don Eladio wasn't impressed by their product in the meeting; he called Meth a biker/hillbilly drug."
breakingbad,3delnk,Thiswas_a_valued_rug,2,Wed Jul 15 18:46:07 2015 UTC,"If the cartel wasn't impressed by something in Gus and meth, then how is it that Gus is the head of the cartel's meth distribution operation in the American southwest?  While Gus might not have been the chemist, he probably still understood and was able to cook the product."
breakingbad,3delnk,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe it took the cartel awhile to accept that meth was a real money-maker? They didn't want to be in business with Gus at the beginning, but realized their mistake years later.  I'm really intrigued by Gus' past, which they definitely left ambiguous. But there's that flashback where Tio holds one of the Cousin's heads under water when they're children, and the conversation Tio is having on the phone is some thing about, ""chicken brothers, big General...south Americans are dirty people."" and then when they kill Max, they say some thing to Gus about knowing his past in Chile...  So my favorite theory? Gus used to be a real badass in the Chilean army, a General, but then moved north to try and become a ""legitimate"" businessman. The Cartel knew his past, put him in his place. But Gus became successful anyway, and the Cartel wanted a piece of that still.  Damn I gotta re-watch, such a vast universe they made."
breakingbad,3delnk,Thiswas_a_valued_rug,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:05:07 2015 UTC,"Don Eladio kept Gus alive because he knew of his previous Chilean ties and distribution expertise, which he wished to utilize to the cartel's advantage."
breakingbad,3delnk,FastSloth6,2,Fri Jul 17 03:41:05 2015 UTC,This is correct. Gus's supply was coming from the cartel....which is why he wanted to and successfully did create his own production / cut off the cartel.

breakingbad,3ddghv,ackchanticleer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:21:39 2015 UTC,"Ive thought about that myself and imo Walt would have used  the fact that he was about to die of cancer as a positive for him. I seriously doubt he would want to die slowly of cancer in a crappy prison hospital and have Skyler and the kids thrown out of the house. so bet he would have made some sort of deal with the prosecutor saying he'll plead guilty, tell them everything he knows (Walt would have no more loyalty to Jesse once he found out he was working with Hank) and cooperate to bring down everyone; And in exchange no charges will be filed against Skyler, she gets to keep the house and Walt get to spend the rest of his short life under house arrest.  Imo it would be dumb for the prosecutor to not agrees to this since it would probably be pointless to go after walt since he will probably be dead within a year or so. They can be stubborn  and try to throw the book at him and get nothing, or they can work with him to try to crack everything open and bring everyone down"

They didn't move in one or two years because Walt ended up leaving Gray Matter, which iirc he hadn't at that time.  Also it's sad to see their earlier, happier interactions with what their relationship becomes. Stuff like Fifty-One is all the more powerful when we saw how happy they used to be together."

Yeah my first thought was just that they were showing the happy marriage Walt and Skylar came from as a contrast to their current state. Showing his ambition is the more interesting part in my opinion--Walt's desire for more is very apparent in the scene.   They didn't move in one or two years because Walt ended up leaving Gray Matter, which iirc he hadn't at that time.   This part is a bit interesting to me, because in the opening scene Walt is actually saying that they shouldn't buy the house in the first place and just look for something better. The opening then ends on that somewhat hopeful sort of note. I wonder if they did originally say 'no' and go look for other places, only to find themselves unable to make anything work and come back. Or maybe Skylar just convinced him to not go for the bigger house at all, and they ""settled"" for this one. If the latter, maybe that's an early instance of Walt feeling like Skylar was holding him back or whatever.  Most likely I'm just reading too much into it but it's fun to do, I suppose haha"

breakingbad,3d6hxk,batsdx,6,Mon Jul 13 22:57:20 2015 UTC,"Gale was one of the few truly nice and good hearted people on the show. Sure, he cooked meth for a living, but he was good at heart. His death was extremely saddening for me.    That scene however was OWNED by Aaron. Absolutely superb acting on both sides, but Aaron Paul did tremendously well. IMHO it's the best acted scene in the show, and the best season finale (barring the series finale)."
breakingbad,3d6hxk,tintin_92,2,Tue Jul 14 04:06:02 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Usually I don't give a shit when a person dies in a movie or a show, but my heart really got crushed when Jesse pointed the gun to Gale. It felt so real; the acting was absolutely amazing"
breakingbad,3d6hxk,freenie,2,Wed Jul 15 22:11:11 2015 UTC,"Yup, absolutely dreadful. Even the meth cooking is justified pretty well by him - ""I think people should have the right to buy what they want - and in any case, they'll be buying it anyway - so at least with me they know what they're getting, unadulterated."" Gale was an incredibly likable character who ended up being used as a pawn and dying in the crossfire."
breakingbad,3d6hxk,DabuSurvivor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:41:05 2015 UTC,He was most likely made incredibly likeable so that it showed you how far Walts moral degeneration had come. He had nothing but praise for Walt and was very friendly to him but Walt still ordered Jesse to murder him anyway

My dad came to America from Vietnam when he was 17, with no family or friends. His English isn't that great, but I am the only one in our family who can understand him and can be patient when he tries to discuss anything. I told him he would love this show, even though it wasn't Xenia: warrior princess, Hercules, or the X-Files (but I surely let him know one of the writers is the show runner/creator of Breaking Bad). He fucking loved it! He didn't care for the drug use, but understood the necessity of its use to tell the story. We've never had a very strong relationship (due to me being gay and a former drug addict), but we really bonded over this. It's funny how a TV show can have an impact on someone's life, but I'm happy it did."

breakingbad,3d0tnl,DwendilSurespear,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:45:55 2015 UTC,How do you attach them to the video file?
breakingbad,3d0tnl,BadBalloons,3,Sun Jul 12 22:35:19 2015 UTC,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uBMmHW2E8j4  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GP2Muy2MTKI  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7nvSj_ddhVg  before you go on that link choose a tv show/movie. Choose a language for your subtitle. Save it to your desktop. I recommend having 7 Zip and VLC player. VLC has a subtitle option setting so if your subtitles are glitched you can set the language. And then the second link is if there is a problem with the subtitle itsself. Third link is how you can fix subtitles using VLC Player

breakingbad,3d0tnl,ProjectD13X,2,Mon Jul 13 09:19:40 2015 UTC,"Tried talking my Dad into watching it since it started,  he had no interest.

He would watch on his iPad in doctors waiting rooms,  at Target, in the little snack area while my Mom shopped, and at home when my Mother was watching something he didn't like.

breakingbad,3cy8p9,scrawledfilefish,57,Sat Jul 11 21:27:04 2015 UTC,This reminds me of it even more. I always saw Jesse and Walter act like father and son
breakingbad,3cy8p9,anonymous028,19,Sun Jul 12 00:08:22 2015 UTC,Holy shit! Walt is the father Jesse never had (kicked out of home etc) and Jesse is the son Walt never had (Walt Jr being handicapped and not fully capable of father son activities eg the driving lesson going bad)
breakingbad,3cy8p9,MrJens,21,Sun Jul 12 07:22:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know that Jesse is ""better"" than Walt Jr.  I don't think Walt ever thought of his son as less-than for being disabled.   But at some point Jesse did become family.    I'm thinking of the scene when Walt was in the bar with Jane's dad, and he talked about never ever giving up on your children no matter what.  That's what made Walt go back to the apartment, leading to Jane's death, etc.  But still, that's the point for me where Walt first had fatherly feelings for Jesse.    That and when Walt decided to kill the drug dealers that Jesse was going to kill, to save him: ""run.""  Walt didn't have to do that.  He could have stayed home and let things play out, with no risk to himself.  He couldn't.  Also, when Walt was out of it, and Walt Jr. tucked him into bed, and he fell asleep saying ""Jesse.""  That was pretty a obvious mix-up of sons, there.  It's especially interesting since Walt Jr. never has any idea who ""Jesse"" was throughout the entire show, all the way to the end.  It was very much a father/son relationship, even if a really dysfunctional fucked-up one.  If Jesse was his son, then Walt was shit as a father, given how much abuse he was always dumping on him.  But he wasn't his father exactly either.  Their relationship is complicated, and weird, and the more wonderful for it."
breakingbad,3cy8p9,elbruce,7,Sun Jul 12 10:39:57 2015 UTC,Walt was shit as a father   Yup.

breakingbad,3cy3ao,sprylab,14,Sat Jul 11 22:37:00 2015 UTC,Nope. That's why Hank was using the master bathroom.
breakingbad,3cy3ao,dlopez1196,29,Sat Jul 11 23:53:52 2015 UTC,And why Walt pissed in the sink.
breakingbad,3cy3ao,SubEclipse,14,Sun Jul 12 00:01:24 2015 UTC,Hank used the master bathroom because it was the closest to the pool.  There's no way a multi-bedroom house has only one bathroom that's attached to the master bedroom.
breakingbad,3cy3ao,BaZing3,7,Sun Jul 12 04:51:04 2015 UTC,this is what I was thinking too! This is the weirdest house with 3 bedrooms and only 1 full bathroom in the master bedroom? No wonder why they were stuck on the house. The pool does not count as toilet for me and that's almost a dealbreaker if I was looking for a new place.
breakingbad,3cy3ao,FezEscobar,2,Sun Jul 12 13:56:12 2015 UTC,I agree. I was trying to keep the drawing as close to the show as possible without adding on too much guesswork.
breakingbad,3cy3ao,kirbyforlife69,0,Tue Jul 14 02:39:31 2015 UTC,Hank used the master bathroom cuz he was out side and it was much fast to use the masterbathroom

breakingbad,3cy3ao,DabuSurvivor,2,Sun Jul 12 02:17:13 2015 UTC,"I think that's the same one. This is Walt passing out in ""Buried"", and this is Walt using the same toilet Hank used and realizing Leaves is missing."
breakingbad,3cy3ao,crazycroz,15,Sun Jul 12 06:08:29 2015 UTC,"Wait, in order to goto the bathroom, people had to go through Walt's bedroom?"

breakingbad,3cy3ao,Creeyas,25,Sat Jul 11 21:01:52 2015 UTC,Where did Skyler take the bath Walt walked out on during his 'fugue state'? Didn't he approach the door from the hallway?
breakingbad,3cy3ao,Plex0re,8,Sun Jul 12 00:18:10 2015 UTC,"I had to rewatch that episode because I thought the same thing. It's easy to miss, but he actually walks all the way down the hallway into their room before he opens the bathroom door."

breakingbad,3cy3ao,SongOfUnhealing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with that, however I scaled the house to the actual property on Google Earth, and I scaled the garage to the size of the SUV parked outside, so it kinda shrunk the rooms.

breakingbad,3cy3ao,give_me_orange_juice,3,Sun Jul 12 18:18:32 2015 UTC,"That space between the couple's sink in the master bathroom and the laundry room could have gotten more use from a big time meth cook, eh?"

breakingbad,3cy3ao,JimboYokimbo,2,Sun Jul 12 01:02:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! I tried dipping sticks but they looked too vague xD
breakingbad,3cy3ao,brandoi,3,Tue Jul 14 02:49:41 2015 UTC,"IMO, the garage should be forward more, so at least front bedrooms are more square, and Holly's bedroom has a window. Overall things should be moved around to make practical scale sense (that kitchen can fit a Wagoneer). With that moving around, one might fit a common bathroom between the bedrooms, or more likely, back to back with the master bathroom.  Of course, the TV sets (the White house interior is a set) often do not make sense as a real house, but will for the purposes of filming and the story."
breakingbad,3cy3ao,DabuSurvivor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:54:32 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you.. That kitchen is huuuugge, the living room space is a little weird and there are weird gaps here and there, and no gaps where there should be lol.. Reasons is because I scaled the outline of the house to the actual property on google earth and then tried to fit everything else inside. So somethings worked and others didn't. As you've mentioned, they do a lot of the filming in a studio where the house is recreated and they have more freedom of space and thus it doesn't always make complete sense when trying to recreate. And I didn't want to guess too much and keep it as close to the show as possible =)"

breakingbad,3cub31,codefreak8,11,Sat Jul 11 13:34:32 2015 UTC,"After watching enough Q&A's, I think a good set of regulations to follow is:   Don't ask who their favorite character they've played is/what their favorite project they worked on was (usually the first thing that is asked, and is generally not creative, and the person answering questions is probably tired of it) Don't ask more than one question (that's more for the people behind you in line) Don't ask if you can hug/touch the person answering questions (general fears of Convention Sickness, takes time out of Q&A, and sometimes is creepy, plus it's an issue if you haven't showered that weekend) Don't ask to get a signature (Most people who have a Q&A panel will also have a separate autograph session later) Don't ask any question you wouldn't answer (and by extent, don't ask a question you would only ask a friend) Don't ask for info on upcoming roles/projects (If they can't talk about it elsewhere, they probably can't talk about it in a Q&A) For groups, try not to ask questions directed at the whole group, with the expectation that everyone will answer (a bit more forgivable, but again for the sake of time it's probably more polite to ask a question to only one person, and let others chime in on their own)"

breakingbad,3cx40c,PeterM76,3,Sat Jul 11 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"I read a theory somewhere about how the series technically ended in the second-to-last episode (I forgot the name)  when he's at the bar and sees Grey Matter on TV.  The theory says that he succumbs to his cancer there in the bar, and as he is dying, the finale acts as his daydream/hallucination to ""fix"" everything as best he can.  I love this theory because I found Felina to tie everything up just a little TOO neatly.  The entire show has been about Walt making plans and something awful happening to mess those plans up.  It just seemed weird to me that the final episode everything went according to plan and he not only provided his family with money, but freed Jesse, and avenged Hank's death."
breakingbad,3cx40c,GrilledStuffedDragon,9,Sat Jul 11 20:58:23 2015 UTC,I saw the same theory about Granite State but I read Vince Gilligan shot it down by saying that Walt did things that he couldn't have known about (like saving Jesse.)  I did like the finale because somethings finally went right for Walt but in the process he dies. So it's a happy ending but also tragic - and it's amazing writing that they were able to pull that off.

breakingbad,3cyfuv,TheTobruk,3,Sat Jul 11 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"You summed it up well. The only caveat might be that Walter's health might not have been a factor. Meaning, I imagine Gus Fring would have assassinated Walter after much less than a year. We do not know Gus's history with Gale, but it stands to reason that he trusted Gale limitlessly more than he trusted Walter. If you're Gus, you bring Walt in to cook, at any price. You neutralize a competitor while building the ability to cook Blue in-house."

They have been probably preparing for years, and then a dying meth genius comes along who is completely sane and willing to work with Gus. He had no reason to go after Walt until he started affecting business."
breakingbad,3cyfuv,batsdx,2,Sun Jul 12 11:31:21 2015 UTC,"Gus hadn't been seeing any threat in Walter   Remember the two clearly stated pieces of advice that Gus gives to Walt...""You can never trust a drug addict"" in 211 Mandala at Walt and Gus's first meeting and ""Never make the same mistake twice"" to Walt at dinner at Gus's home.  He knew that Jesse was an immediate threat. So Gus was on his guard about Walt insofar as Walt's loyalty towards Jesse. So it began the long thread of Gus playing the loyalties of Walt against Jesse and vice versa.  Mike-""I'm supposed to tell you that the kid wants to make a deal."" Gus-""Do the deal."" And Jesse only gets half of the cash. Gus directs the cousins towards Hank--and then of course all the propping up of Jesse in season 4 to pit him against Walt.  Gus knew he would have to eventually get rid of Walt--that his ego and feelings towards Jesse made him a threat. It wouldn't surprise me if Gus orchestrated the Jesse/dealer situation to get rid of Jesse and see how Walt reacts to it. When Walt runs them down and throws his lot in with Jesse unequivocally, that expedited Walt being a threat to Walt being an immediate threat. Gus had Gale in the pipe and had been prepping him to start up his own cook North of the border."

breakingbad,3cudqa,anonymous028,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:19:13 2015 UTC,Just ordered some the other day. Are they flavored or just straight vodka?
breakingbad,3cudqa,127crazie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:22:20 2015 UTC,I haven't opened them yet. I'm trying to find a special occasion to do so.
breakingbad,3cw46n,GlutenFreeYoga69,3,Sat Jul 11 07:10:09 2015 UTC,"I watched the scene where Skyler first finds about Walt's drug ""manufacturer"" life and, while I found Skyler's response perfectly believable, I think the writers should've let that sink in a little bit on Walt and not just cut to the next scene immediately. That to me is one of the major, if not the most major, turning point in the series."
breakingbad,3cw46n,lemotif,2,Sat Jul 11 14:47:33 2015 UTC,"I remember thinking that Skylar may never find out about Walt, naive to think about now especially since the cat and mouse game between hank and Walt in the final season was always teased throughout, even season 1. Skylar knowing, refusing to let Walt in the house, becoming passively acceptant, and then cooperating with him is one of the finest arcs of the show. Definitely one of the best scenes."
breakingbad,3cw46n,mazz_17,2,Sun Jul 12 15:45:51 2015 UTC,"I think you can tell a lot about a man by the car he drives.   When Walt decided to ditch his green beast and trade it in for a meaner and nastier set of wheels for himself and Walter Junior, it showed a side of him that he was the king of the town now that Gus Fring was no longer on the scene.   Huge turning point from the 'business' side of his empire!"
breakingbad,3cw46n,mrwho995,2,Sat Jul 11 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. Selling the Aztek for 50 bucks, that scene actually makes me uncomfortable rewatching it, knowing that he's smothering Walter in favor of the Heisenberg alter ego.  Love the shots with the heinsenberg hat too haha."
breakingbad,3cw46n,DabuSurvivor,2,Sun Jul 12 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I never would have thought of that scene as a turning point in one's opinion of Walt.   I think I started actively disliking Walt after he let Jane die in 'Phoenix', and that dislike was cemented with his rant in school in S3E1, but the hatred wasn't a constant and fluctuated a lot. I think the time I stopped having any sympathy for Walt whatsoever was when he 'forgave' Skyler in S5E1, but that was less of a turning point and more of a 'straw that broke the camel's back'. I think if there's a single truly character defining scene for me, it'd be the way in which Hank treated Marie after his accident. Although I never disliked her as much as others seemed to, I didn't really feel for her as a character until that moment."

breakingbad,3cxt1g,glowtmickey,0,Sun Jul 12 00:31:19 2015 UTC,"Badfinger's Baby Blue. It became a smash hit, they hit the jackpot when Vince Gilliam picked it. It was playing while Walt was laughing and dying with that smile on his face. I`d say BB officially did end on a musical number and badness10000 was correct. You're right though, it was bound to happen that way, he didn't guess how it got to that point of course."
breakingbad,3cxt1g,glowtmickey,6,Sun Jul 12 03:08:12 2015 UTC,"I think the guy meant something more akin to ""Meth: The Musical"" or something rather than the soundtrack."

breakingbad,3cu7u5,minionspicrequest,15,Fri Jul 10 20:34:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's obvious that he suffers from depression. He is dissatisfied with his jobs at the school and car wash, and he is dissatisfied with his family. Even before his cancer diagnosis no part of his life seems to give him a shred of happiness. He doesn't have a good relationship with his mother because he doesn't bother to tell her about his cancer. Selling meth is the first thing he seems to actually be passionate about, other than science itself (in his teaching scenes it is clear he enjoys science but is not fulfilled with his students).  Then, once he does start selling meth, he derives very little joy from it. He is calculating and methodical, and no amount of money brings him any closure or happiness. He becomes most invested with solving the problems around him, and pays no attention to the good things in his life like his (initially) supportive family and co-workers.  So clinical depression would definitely be an angle I'd explore."
breakingbad,3cu7u5,prezuiwf,6,Fri Jul 10 21:09:13 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for this amazing response.
breakingbad,3cu7u5,mintrolling,2,Fri Jul 10 21:22:27 2015 UTC,"I think this is more fitting than any of the others although god complex is reasonable as well. I think one of the first major signs of it may have been the scene where he is exercising and looking at his old award.  It shows he has become old, but due to a mistake on his part, has not lived anywhere near to his potential, and will (seemingly) be dead within the year anyway."
breakingbad,3cu7u5,codythomashunsberger,8,Fri Jul 10 21:21:31 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't agree that Walt is riddled with mental disorders, or that greed qualifies as one. There's a difference between living a double life/hiding stuff from your family and having multiple personalities over which you have no control."
breakingbad,3cu7u5,batsdx,-3,Fri Jul 10 21:14:37 2015 UTC,over which you have no control.   But that's the thing in my opinion. Does he really have control? Is Heisenberg the same person as Walt (mentally)? That makes me think it is a mental disorder.
breakingbad,3cu7u5,crappymathematician,3,Fri Jul 10 21:19:38 2015 UTC,"Heisenberg isn't some extra personality or persona. It's just the alias he gives to avoid giving out his real name. It's always just Walt reacting to the situations he is in, the best he knows how."
breakingbad,3cu7u5,MyAssTakesMastercard,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:27:14 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Heisenberg is an extra personality because Heisenberg represents the meth business, the murders.  While on the other hand, there Walt, the caring family dad.   I think however that these two personalities become one over the time, with the Heisenberg one clearly dominating.  But I think that's something each of us look differently at."
breakingbad,3cu7u5,Shamu787,3,Fri Jul 10 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"I think you may be missing a point of the show. Well, maybe I'm missing a point of the show, but I thought that the key theme was how Walt was always Heisenberg. He was always an arrogant, talented, bitter, self-important, coldly tactical yet easily provoked man. He enjoyed the meth business for the immediate power it afforded him. Guy's causing you trouble? Just have him killed. There is so much bitterness in that man that he will lash out at anybody that he feels has wronged him, and he's finally stumbled into a world where that sort of destructive reprisal is almost normal.  I'm not saying that Walter never cared about his family, because he clearly loves his children (+ Jessie), Hank, and maybe Skyler and Marie as well. But what makes him so compelling as a character is that Walter White was always capable of doing those things."

breakingbad,3cv9qc,purpleguitar1984,3,Sat Jul 11 01:43:20 2015 UTC,It was a father-son relationship that Walt didn't have with his own child- Walt Jr.  Flynn (who rejects his own father's name) is closer to Hank and Walt hates this (remember the drinking scene by the pool.)  At the beginning Walt feels a connection to Jesse and it becomes paternal.  But I think the more that Heisenberg comes out the less this becomes a father/relationship because Walt loses his unconditional support/love for Jesse.
breakingbad,3cv9qc,PeterM76,2,Sat Jul 11 15:43:31 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% in general. I just didn't see why Walt was so willing to put up with Jesse.  But, I do not think Walt was at a point in that part of the show where he would be willing to kill anybody who didn't pose a direct life-or-death threat. Maybe I am wrong, but I don't see it."

breakingbad,3crsz2,Qawi9,4,Sun Jul 19 14:22:41 2015 UTC,I was willing to give him chances until the video he made about how Hank forced him to make meth and he was trapped. That video made me dislike Walt altogether but I did admire his persistence to give his family the money for support.

breakingbad,3cspga,B00tyWarrior,2,Sat Jul 11 08:46:27 2015 UTC,"Well, Walt was in serious danger and was also slowly making people significantly more dead. From her point of view, is that a thing that should be appreciated?  Also, are multiple murders less serious than cheating?  This is one of the reasons I love Breaking Bad.

breakingbad,3cspga,ZepherusYT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:26:06 2015 UTC,I never said his murders were justified. What i am saying is that she didn't appreciate his devotion to the family and saw him just like a criminal. Also this is not a debate on what is worse. Her fucking Ted was not necessary at all.

breakingbad,3cspga,MyNutsin1080p,2,Fri Jul 10 20:55:37 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who actually prefers Skyler to Marie? IMO, Skyler, as a wife and mother, did what she could in regards to the situations that arose. Were they all the right decisions? Arguably no, but that's what makes her character stand out, as opposed to Marie, whose character fades away as the series progresses. Skyler never asked to be the wife of a drug kingpin. She made many of her choices (e.g. sleeping with Ted, giving Ted money, etc.) in circumstances of distress that were a direct result of Walt's rise to power. On the other hand, Marie is the big mouthed, spoiled younger sister who also happens to be a kleptomaniac.  In recently watching the series again, I noticed many of the characters all happen to have vices they have to deal with throughout the series (e.g. Walt is greedy/lustful for power). If Marie's was her kleptomania, Skyler's was her involuntary involvement as a criminal accomplice, which makes her character more interesting to me and not as one-sided people make her out to be."
breakingbad,3cspga,NolaBrownsFan,2,Sat Jul 11 09:56:19 2015 UTC,"I'm with OP, and I was actually surprised that Vince Gilligan was surprised! Here's how it makes sense to me (in other words, just my humble opinion):  Skyler's own story, or her own point of view, isn't fleshed out enough for us to see her actions from anyone's point of view but Walt's. For example, we don't get to see how and why she has no loyalty to Walter when she suspects him of wrongdoing (though this changes later), but is instantly accommodating of Ted when she finds out how he's been embezzling from his company.  Maybe Vince Gilligan had all of these ideas and concepts in mind when he wrote the scripts, but since we're not privy to very much of her decision-making, it comes across as consistently contrary to Walt, no matter what. She comes across as erratic, shrewish, and self-centered."
breakingbad,3cspga,Bongloads4Breakfast,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:31:07 2015 UTC,This was my favorite moment from the whole show and really made me like Skyler.
breakingbad,3cspga,PeterM76,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:28:11 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again: a ""Breaking Bad"" in which Skyler just goes along willingly with whatever Walt does without protest or resistance might make for a more universally liked character, but it would make for bad television and the show wouldn't have nearly the depth that it does.  Walt harbored fantasies of Skyler understanding exactly why he turned to a life of crime before she became aware of it.  Once she became aware of it, Walt harbored fantasies of being able to find a way to explain it all to her that would make her understand and not put up any fight about anything he does. Once it became clear that would never happen, Walt harbored fantasies of simply cowing his wife into subservience, which is pretty much what he thought he could do with Jesse, Mike, Saul, and Hank, and he was met in each instance with varying degrees of failure.  If you don't like Skyler, I really don't know what to say to you. I think if the events of Breaking Bad were to unfold in real life, the household part of it would play much like it did on screen. Walt wants to secure his family's future, but all he was really doing was putting them all in danger every step of the way."
breakingbad,3cspga,batsdx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:49:31 2015 UTC,I hate here up until Season 4 when she joins the dark side and helps with the money laundering.  Before that she is annoying and weak.
breakingbad,3cspga,Diial,-3,Fri Jul 10 16:07:40 2015 UTC,Nope. I hate this fucking bitch. My dude Walter is raking in fat stacks and she's sleeping with tool bag Ted
breakingbad,3cspga,Diial,0,Fri Jul 10 14:03:31 2015 UTC,I don't dislike her character.  What I really find unwatchable are the scenes with her and Marie.  Every time the two of them have a scene together it's like the dialogue and acting goes off the deep end.  The characters are sisters and every scene is like they're people who just met and have no history- the chemistry is just awful.
breakingbad,3cspga,LieutenantRiggs,0,Fri Jul 10 18:06:02 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I missed when they said the relationship between Marie/Skyler, and I thought Hank/Skyler were siblings, so for a couple episodes it made sense."

He had given up and was ready to finally face the music. He decided to go back only when he saw Gretchen slamming him on TV and heard that the blue meth was back, which triggered his pride in its two most vulnerable places."
breakingbad,3ck5br,TheFabledFamilyGuy,11,Wed Jul 8 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"This is all just my interpretation but Walt being in remission must feel like all the meth cooking has been for nothing since he's going to be ok now and he's made all the huge risks for nothing.  And the deal with Walt blowing up at Hank has got to be the whole ""Jr. confiding in Hank"" thing coming to a boiling point.  Just a theory."
breakingbad,3ck5br,ajfromsnooty,6,Wed Jul 8 15:59:48 2015 UTC,"That's clearly what the show was trying to portray.  Cooking was never about saving his life, it was about leaving something after he dies."
breakingbad,3ck5br,Ironalpha,7,Wed Jul 8 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"Not only did the ""good"" news of remission cause anger within Walt in that it would render his reckless abandon in the drug game unjustified. He entered and cooked in the criminal life only with an end in sight. Without that, Walt starts asking ""why am I actually cooking"". He asks it to himself in the scene you mentioned when he tells Jesse the news. In that moment I feel Walt was sad at the prospect of giving up the criminal life.   And we learn why he does. He did it for himself. He liked it. He was the best at something. Sadly, to attain this empire built on ego Walt systematically burns his familial bridges. When Walt saw Hank regaling Jr yet again with his stories of unbridled masculinity at Glencoe training, he didn't see the brother in law. He saw the agent charged with taking him down. ""My house. My son. My bottle!"" It was Heisenberg rearing his ugly head. He even says the next day in his voicemail apology to skyler ""I'm not totally sure who that was yesterday but it wasn't me."""
breakingbad,3ck5br,dimplepinch,2,Wed Jul 8 16:43:05 2015 UTC,"Everything Walt did (at least for the first few seasons) he does for his family. He has already accepted and made peace with the fact that he will die and he believes that it will happen soon. So he begins cooking meth to get enough money to provide for his family after his death. He wants everything to be perfect for them, including the way they view him (as a loving father who provided for them). If he were to die instead of going into remission he would have accomplished this, they would have had the money and wouldn't have to worry about them discovering his secret. But since he enters remission and death is now postponed things get complicated. He can't leave the meth business (Tucco won't let him... and his pride starts to get the better of him) and his secret keeping is started to effect his family. He also didn't like the chemistry teacher Walter White, that Walter White was wasting his potential and never did what he wanted; death was a release from this life and it was denied him. I'm not 100% sure what was going through his mind when he was giving Jr. the tequila (sometimes the characters actions seem to be more artistic rather than realistic or rational) but my best guess is that by cooking meth he finally said ""fuck the rules"" and it felt good so he decides to break more rules."
breakingbad,3ck5br,lotrislove,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:53:15 2015 UTC,"In the episode where Jesse and Walt are trying to get rid of the fly buzzing around in Gus' lab, Walt contemplates about this. Basically he says that he wanted people to remember him fondly before he died. He says that the night that he met Jane's dad was the night he should have died--when things with his family were finally started getting better. Walt knew it was only a matter of time before his business with meth would worsen his relationship with his family.   Also, I once heard that disappointment is a common reaction for terminally ill patients who get ""good"" news that they'll live longer. I think it has something to do with expectations. I can't find anything to back it up, but it makes sense. A patient given a death sentence would go through the whole grieving process, mentally prepare for death, tell all their loved ones the bad news, and trying to live the rest of their life to the fullest. Getting ""good"" news however would put to waste all that time and energy."
breakingbad,3ck5br,esurkareality,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:51:26 2015 UTC,"Walt likes to be in control. When he got his diagnosis, he decided that from then on, he would always be the 'captain of his own soul' so to speak.  When the doctor tells him that he is in remission, that screws up his plans. He wasn't planning on living longer. Living longer means he has to deal with consequences. He wasn't suppose to last long enough to see any consequences. So now he has to adjust his plans.  The same is true of Walt, Jr. He doesn't like Hank, and never has. He can't stand the idea that Hank is going to raise his son after he dies. So his actions are about having control over his son in front of Hank.  Later on there will be a scene with Walt in the waiting room for his CT Scan. In that scene he tells the other patient about how 'accepting that you have no control' is bullshit. It's really quite a powerful scene.   There is also a scene with Walt and Hank in Hank's bedroom, where he gives a powerful speech about fear and being in control. Be looking for those two scenes."

I remember I watched it outside though which for some reason makes me think I was out at the park prior or something, I dunno.  Anyway, my friend/roommate presented it to me as he had just watched it and had it downloaded. It seemed like a great opportunity so I did. Trust me, it made it much better.  If you haven't done psychedelics they don't really make you miss things, people say they expand your consciousness for a reason. Most people can't even tell I'm tripping, it's not like alcohol where you're stumbling around and slurring your words. I'm just a little more fascinated by things, in a better mood, and more friendly really. My mind, especially on LSD, feels very sharp and clean, often times I feel like it's easier to think critically while on psychedelics, your thoughts just flow so smoothly and it feels very easy to get all the gears turning if that makes sense. A description just doesn't do it justice. It can also have many opposite effects, confusion, dysphoria, paranoia, etc, but those tend to be rather rare in comparison and if I had been in that state of mind I would not have wanted to watch the show."

breakingbad,3cajkf,Jagermeister4,5,Mon Jul 6 21:47:24 2015 UTC,"Us. If anyone would know good Breaking Bad trivia it would be us.  Lets see...off the top of my head....While filming that great montage scene at the start of No Half Measures the actress who played Wendy was actually mistaken as real prostitute.  As a huge fan of both shows I love this one... Many people involved in Breaking Bad always once worked on The X Files.  Vince had to show the bigwigs at Sony Bryan Cranston's episode of the X Files to prove to them he could play Walter White (So imo, that episode of the x files was basically Bryan Cranston's audition for Walter White.)  The more I think of it this could easily turn into a trivia night of how many connections does Breaking Bad have to the x files- a lot.  Chris Carter, the creator of the X Files is all about the number 1013. When Jesse killed Gale it said 10:13 on his clock. Coincidence?    A well known bad guy on the x files is ""the cancer man"" Episode 4   of Breaking Bad is called ""Cancer man"" which Vince did say was named after him"

I also would have liked a mention or some resolution to the child that was shot and killed by Todd.  I will always assume Jesse will leak the body's location or information, but cannot know for sure; pure optimism.

But there were two things to keep in mind: first, by the end of the last episode most if not all subplots should be closed, and that was pretty tight. Even so, they managed to include almost all the characters in the series (Breaking Bad delivering, as always).  And second, and I decided after the show, that it was really good enough. That the show had been so overwelmingly constant in its amazingness, that I could watch a fly eating a turd in the last episode, and probably would not change my overall opinion on the show.  So.. they were not bad, just a tad over par.  EDIT: spelling."

I think that goes a long way in explaining why Walt was not so worried about leaving his copy of Leaves Of Grass from Gale in his own bathroom under a stack of magazines when he's assuming that Skyler would be the only other person to notice it and she wouldn't have any idea what the association to Gale was.  I believe at one point he had it on the bedside table with some other books so at least he had the sense to 'hide' it in the bathroom."

That's why he's hesitant to even give the show a chance. At the same time, I think Breaking Bad is a series so good it doesn't matter who you are or what your set of morals are when it comes to enjoying it (it's not as if it advocates anything bad...actually it's central theme could arguably be showing the consequences/destruction evil choices reap).  I get a lot of enjoyment introducing friends/family members to great shows like this, and I know he'd enjoy it if he actually gave it a chance with an open mind and saw what a masterpiece it is. It's just an amazing piece of art regardless of your religious preference or level of uptightness.

breakingbad,3bxzi7,hamz_28,9,Fri Jul 3 02:15:20 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that it is mentioned, and proven time and time again that while Walt may have started off doing it to make money to not leave his family dirt poor upon death, he stayed in it because behind all the family shit Walt is a stubborn, selfish egotistical asshole. Giving up Jesse fueled the idea further, proving that he was willing to betray anyone to further himself. At least that is my opinion.  tl;dr: Yes, I find it realistic considering who Walt truly is."
breakingbad,3bxzi7,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,4,Fri Jul 3 02:34:00 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it I think my feelings were subjective. I wanted to believe Walt was worth rooting for, but what he did to Jesse...   And the more I think about, his motivations make sense. He heard the blue meth was back, so he surmised Jesse must be cooking again, and wrongfully assumed he partnered up, which was a betrayal beyond measure for Walt, a pollution to his legacy.   It just kills me, it was so easy for Walt not to say anything, and remember all he and Jesse had been through. But it probably wasn't even Walt at all (he was basically dead), Heisenberg more likely."
breakingbad,3bxzi7,_Trilobite_,2,Fri Jul 3 02:42:44 2015 UTC,I thought you were talking about when he pointed out that Jesse was hiding under the car? At that point Jesse wasn't cooking for Todd's guys.  Or were you talking about when he outed him to skinny pete and badger?
breakingbad,3bxzi7,dimplepinch,2,Fri Jul 3 12:29:33 2015 UTC,"I had a much different interpretation of the pre-shootout motivations in Felina. I don't think Walt assumed that Jesse partnered with Jack. If you watch the scene with Badger and Skinny in the back of the car, Walt seems sadly surprised when he concludes ""Jesse."" Furthermore, Badger and Skinny have had no contact with Jesse and it probably would have been pretty easy for Walt to find out about Andrea's death. Also when Walt saw that Jesse wasn't present in Jack's clubhouse it was a safe bet that Jesse hadn't partnered with Jack's crew but was still in indentured servitude like the last time Walt saw him the desert. He made the comment to Jack about him partnering with Jesse because he knew that calling Jack a liar would not only stall his own death but also tick him off enough to show Jesse to Walt. Not to kill Jesse, but to save him."

Walt had already felt betrayed and was furious at Jesse while he was in cuffs. After the shootout, Walt still thought that Jesse was a threat. Jesse was putting a lot of heat on Walt at the time anyway.  I didn't really understand Walt's reaction either on my first watch. I wish I knew where that article was."
breakingbad,3bxzi7,imcguyver,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:30:20 2015 UTC,"It made perfect sense for Walt's character at that stage. He feels he's been betrayed by Jesse because Jesse snitched; at that point any feelngs of 'surrogate son' have gone. He's struck with shock and grief over Hank's death, ruminating over how it pretty much means his life is over, and he blames it all, rightly or wrongly, on Jesse. Also, Jesse clearly is now a threat to him. If Jesse went to Hank, he'll go to anyone else in the DEA too. From a pragmatic standpoint, Walt needs Jesse out of the picture. Is it cold and cruel? Yes, and that's the whole point; that decision from Walt is arguably the climax from a 5 season long build up of Walt's character."

Walt had always been a bit beta towards his wife & I couldn't picture him having the balls to stand up to his wife at that point.
breakingbad,3buy1y,tikhung01,7,Thu Jul 2 10:38:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Walt was that much of a monster. Sure, cooking meth, killing people and poisoning a little kid aren't good. But you can say that about Mike, Gus or hell even Marie.    I will say that about Mike and Gus: they are both pretty monstrous, cold-blooded killers. There are aspects of their personality that we respect and even admire (and the same is true for Walt), but in the grand scheme yes they have chosen to do horrible things with their lives. Marie did not cook meth, kill people, and poison a little kid, this is just silly: nobody is claiming that ""evil"" and ""monstrous"" are synonymous with minor misdeeds like shoplifting.  Walt is not a ""monster,"" if by monster we mean a two-dimensional cartoon villain. He's an extremely human and often well-intentioned man who winds up doing horrible things and bringing down tragedy on everyone he cares about (and plenty of others). The point of the series is largely to explore the nature of evil, and show that it doesn't just mean a two-dimensional cartoon villain, or Hitler."

So not fair to compare the Walt of the finale to the Walt who is trying to run a meth business empire. Walt ruthlessly kills anyone who gets in the way of his plan. He's the one who leaves Jesse with those degenerate Nazis. And he only goes after the Nazis because he believes they are using his name and his product to make $$$.

It seems pretty obvious Jesse was doing it against his will, especially because the entire time he basically wanted out and Walt forced him to stay) and the reason he went on his suicide mission and even wanted Jesse to kill him himself, was because he realised his mistakes and how he wrongly put Jesse in the worst mess possible, even worse than all the other things he had done in the first 5 and a half seasons which he probably regretted by that part then.  But yeah in short I agree with you, Walt was a dick until his time alone to reflect on how much of an ass he was, but I think that entire last episode, how he planned everything out to perfection in true Heisenberg manner, was his redemption - as he didn't do it for himself, he died in the end and ensured Jesse lived (and got justified revenge)"
breakingbad,3buy1y,triple_chamber_bong,2,Fri Jul 3 13:13:20 2015 UTC,"I'd have liked that to be true, but the interviews with Cranston, Paul and Gilligan afterwards prove otherwise. They specifically referenced The Searchers, in that the protagonist is determined to kill the person they're hunting down and only changes his mind at the last minute. Walt was all set to kill Jesse alongside everyone else, but when he saw the state of him he couldn't bring himself to do it."
breakingbad,3buy1y,Spotinella,9,Sun Jul 5 08:34:20 2015 UTC,"See this brings up a point.  From Walts point of view his actions/killing could be somewhat justified when you're surrounded by drug kingpins, assassins and criminals. From watching the show which is predominantly based around Walts point of view it's easy for us to morally side with him as he believes he is doing right.  But when looking at the bigger picture, his greed and lust for power made him responsible for many innocent deaths, and ruined many peoples lives. (You still gotta love him though, but not forget he was a very bad man)....But that's just my opinion."
breakingbad,3buy1y,darthft,6,Thu Jul 2 11:16:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is an unpopular opinion.  I see people post that here all the time.  And while I don't share it, I don't blame people for being so sympathetic to Walt because of the humanity Bryan Cranston has always brought to the performance.   He has always made us vested in what happens to him, to understand Walt's headspace and because of that it is not uncommon for people to rationalize his actions just as the character himself rationalized them."
breakingbad,3buy1y,CMelody,6,Thu Jul 2 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"All lot of people say how much of a bitch Skyler is but people seem to forget how much of a dick Walt could be. He says it was all for his family (even though he later admitted he liked it) But it was all about himself. Jesse would always be in some sort of jam and he would need Walt's help and Walt would be a total jerk to him. I remember the scene where it looked like Walt was sincerely  apologizing to Skyler for the mess he got them in and then suddenly he was being sarcastic to her. (The Scene where they where reviewing what they where going to say to Marie and Hank explaining how they where suddenly able to afford to buy a carwash.) I was just like, ""what a dick."""
breakingbad,3buy1y,ackchanticleer,3,Thu Jul 2 13:47:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly never saw Skyler as a bitch. She actually put up with so much shit dealing with Walter. She basically held up the entire family all the while knowing that people around her are getting killed, millions of dollars of drugs are being made and hits are being called.  I'm torn between thinking Walt was a dick and just being a man with good intentions but poor luck. Near season 4 is when I honestly started to think he was a dick. He just got greedy. His family was falling apart and his infant daughter just born, his family was clearly in serious danger several times but yet all he wanted was more and more millions. Exciting to watch but if he wasn't an asshole, he would just stop.  There was a scene I think in season 5 where Walt and Sky are looking at this giant block of money sitting in the storage locker and Sky stonefaced just says ""we have more money than we could possibly spend in 10 lifetimes. Was it worth it? How much more do you need?"" And I couldn't help but agree with her."
breakingbad,3buy1y,_Trilobite_,3,Fri Jul 3 12:39:40 2015 UTC,"I go back and forth on it each time I watch the show. Sometimes I agree with how you feel, then other times I hate his guts. But lately I've settled on him being bad. I mean, sure, he saved Jesse, but he was also pretty much the cause of every bad thing that happened to Jesse throughout the show."
breakingbad,3buy1y,Nightwing73,3,Thu Jul 2 10:45:45 2015 UTC,"Sure, cooking meth, killing people and poisoning a little kid aren't good.   That's pretty much the definition of monstrous behavior, lol. And yes, he really was THAT bad. As others have pointed out, he 'saved' Jesse inadvertently - his original intention was to kill him with the Nazis until he saw the situation and a tiny bit of Walt's old humanity kicked in. But Walt wasn't really going there to be victorious. He didn't expect to live through it, hence his goodbyes to the family and leaving his 'earthly possessions', making sure his kids got an inheritance, etc. No way in hell Walt 'died' for Jesse. In fact, he wanted Jesse to shoot him in the end, offering it like some olive branch, as some kind of acknowledgement that Jesse had every right to want to kill him, but really, Walt just wanted to go out like a gangster. He wasn't too concerned about the toll it would have on Jesse's soul, as was usually the case.  As C Melody mentioned, yours is hardly an unpopular opinion. Perhaps more recently, with the wave of new fans binge watching it on Netflix, there is an understanding that Walt is meant to be a jerk. It's been discussed enough in the public consciousness. But when the show finished, plenty of fans felt the same way as you. They were still rooting for him at the end and happy he went out on his own terms."

Walt is a smart man, he left Jesse to be killed by Nazi's, Jesse has no power in this situation... how does he somehow broker a deal to cook meth for them? It seems more likely that Walt caught on to what was really going on, that Jesse was being held against his own will.   I agree Walt broke bad to a point that he was unlikeable, but upon his return, I think the whole last episode was his redemption, and it was very poetic how he planned everything out very Heisenberg like (he accused Jack of being partners with Jesse, which he knew would insult his pride, distract him and bring Jesse in the room so he could get his vengeance too) except this time, Walt wasn't doing it for himself. The well thought out plans wasn't just to off an competitor, it was to save Jesse (because he finally admitted and accepted it was his fault, everything that happened with Hank and what not) and ensure he could live happily/without being a meth slave"
breakingbad,3buy1y,triple_chamber_bong,3,Fri Jul 3 13:18:51 2015 UTC,"It seems more likely that Walt caught on to what was really going on, that Jesse was being held against his own will.    Actually, that is not the case at all. Vince Gilligan has spoken at length about Walt's feelings for Jesse in the end being lifted from The Searchers, where John Wayne spends the entire film planning on finding Natalie Wood's character so he can kill her. But in the end, when he finally sees her situation, he saves her instead.  In the scene where Walt watches Gretchen and Elliot on the Charlie Rose segment, he discovers that the blue meth he made so popular is back on the streets. He knows of only one other person who can replicate his formula and that's Jesse. When he is paying off Badger and Skinny Pete in the car, they confirm that its his product on the streets. Walt is visibly pissed off. Regardless of how he left Jesse in the Nazi's 'care', he obviously imagines that Jesse has somehow sweet talked himself into a deal, probably as a means to get his way out of a death sentence. All Walt knows is that he paid the Nazis to kill Jesse, and the proof that Jesse is alive and cooking suggests to him that Jesse is doing well. Walt knows nothing about Todd's fascination with Lydia and wanting to please her.   He accuses Jack of partnering with Jesse to get them all in the room so his robogun can take them all out at once, not to 'save' Jesse. It's only when he sees him that he decides at the last minute to throw himself on Jesse before hitting the switch on the key fob. That he takes a bullet in the melee is pretty much what he expected.  Sorry, you can have your own interpretation, of course, but the writers' intent was the complete reverse opposite of what you suppose."
breakingbad,3buy1y,eva_brauns_team,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:46:14 2015 UTC,"I guess we can agree to disagree then, the viewer's interpretation is just as true as the writer's :)  We both have valid speculations on how it went down.   Walt is visibly pissed off.   That's your interpretation but I feel it's a bit of a stretch.   He accuses Jack of partnering with Jesse to get them all in the room so his robogun can take them all out at once    If Jack and Jesse were really partners like Walt suspected (as you're proposing) wouldn't Jack just go 'Yep, we're partners. Now I'm going to shoot you.' No, I think Walt knew by saying that, since Jesse wasn't his partner, it would cause Jack to bring Jesse in the room, allowing him to save him and help him get vengeance (and even offer him the chance to kill him, which seemed like something planned beforehand)."
breakingbad,3buy1y,triple_chamber_bong,3,Sat Jul 4 16:03:56 2015 UTC,"Well, if Jack agreed, then Walt's next step would be to ask to see him. As I said, the viewer can have his own ideas about what they're seeing, but in this case, it was written in a very specific way. I'm not giving you a version of events, but how it actually went down. I can give you a dozen links to interviews in which both the writers and the actors talk about the emotions of the characters at that moment. Even Bryan Cranston played it the way I laid out. You want to believe that Heisenberg had this all planned out ahead of time to save Jesse and let him have his vengeance, but that was simply not in the script."
breakingbad,3buy1y,eva_brauns_team,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. The interviews were enough for me, but the way Walt hisses 'Jesse!' when Badger tells him about the cook being better than ever doesn't sound to me like someone who wants good things for Pinkman!"

Walt's unchecked hubris and lust for power poisoned everyone around him, like an infection (i.e. Skylar, Jessie, Hank). He saved Jessie yes, but that wasn't his intention when he originally went to the degenerate Nazi's, he was out for retribution. And we can't forget, how did Jessie become their meth cooking slave in th first place? Walt outed his hiding position under the car, thus allowing them to capture Jessie when he could have just as easily kept quiet.  And how is Marie even vaguely mentionable in this conversation? She shoplifted a bit and liked to pretend to be different people as a form of escapism, not on the same level as murdering innocents or cooking highly addictive drugs."

breakingbad,3buy1y,thisishardcore_,2,Thu Jul 2 18:45:16 2015 UTC,"But you can't equate the magnitude of what they did to Walt, which is my point. If Marie and Walter Jr. broke the law, Walt shattered it.  The original argument was that Walt isn't that bad because other people had broken the law, which makes little to no sense unless you consult the bible I guess, ""No one sin is greater than the other"". Outside that, yeah Marie and Walter Jr. broke the law, they didn't ruin other people's lives in the process."

He cooked a highly addictive, highly illegal drug that probably killed lots offscreen.   He ended, inadvertently or not, the one chance of over 137 people's lives.  He used the family as an excuse."
breakingbad,3buy1y,Gamer9131,2,Fri Jul 3 10:32:53 2015 UTC,"Firstly, if people want to use meth, they'll find a way to get it. Walt is just capitalizing off an industry that will be there whether or not he's there to do it.   Second of all, the plane crash was Jane's father's fault. Jane's death was without a doubt Walt's, but her father didn't have to do that. He's 137 times worse."
breakingbad,3buy1y,_Trilobite_,2,Fri Jul 3 12:45:48 2015 UTC,"Lol, Donald Margolis didn't crash those planes intentionally. The point was he was distressed because of the loss of his daughter and was not reacting well under the strain of his job. His remorse is so great after the fact he tries to take his own life.

Apart from Marlo of course.  Also, The Sopranos. I've still not finished it, I'm nearing the end of Season 4 but it's such a brilliantly written show and not one character feels out of place. If you loved the Walt/Jesse dynamic you'll see that whole relationship was inspired by Tony Soprano and Christopher Moltisanti."

I simply meant that if OP thinks that BB is that good, then The Wire should resonate well with them.   I do however admire the cinematography of Breaking Bad. I've seen very few television shows that have a level of detail and style as it did. Also cost a bunch per episode, put AMC on another level h also thanks to Walking Dead and Mad Men) and allowed Vince to go off and make Saul.   Basically we're arguing Gretzky to Jordan."
breakingbad,3bmsew,thisishardcore_,2,Wed Jul 1 20:03:38 2015 UTC,"I will always love Breaking Bad but The Wire is the superior show in every aspect, apart from the cinematography, but the fact it has a lo-fi minimalistic feel rather than big and tense and cinematic like Breaking Bad is the whole point.  Even the big, climactic, hours worth of roundhouse kicks to the balls episode in it, Final Grades, is better than Ozymandias."

And please excuse the ugly site design, it's a link found from 5 seconds on Google from my mobile."

breakingbad,3bm7ov,thisishardcore_,3,Thu Jul 2 11:53:23 2015 UTC,"I believe the majority of filming took place in the winter months, as the show premiered in July for seasons 4, 5a and 5b. Deserts can get very cold, especially at night, and a lot of the filming outside was likely done in the morning before it got unbearably hot."
breakingbad,3bm7ov,Rahmulous,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:44:59 2015 UTC,I read somewhere that 5A began shooting in March 2012 and wrapped just before it came out.  The other seasons were apparently done over the winter though. You can tell by the way the trees have no leaves on them in some episodes.
breakingbad,3bm7ov,thisishardcore_,3,Thu Jul 2 11:55:48 2015 UTC,"Slovis requested an all-new desert location for the scene where Walt, Saul, and Jesse rendezvous to discuss sending Jesse away. ""I wanted a fresh canvas for that,"" Slovis said. ""If you really look hard, you’ll see breath coming out. It was 5 degrees or 4 degrees. People were dropping like flies. It was so cold, you have no idea. Behind the camera, we were all wearing down vests and hats and we had heaters going. Aaron and Bryan and Bob never ever once complained. Bryan in his email to me on Monday said, “Oh my god, when I saw the scene. It brought it all back to me!” According to Slovis, the scene took about six hours to shoot.  The human actors may have been troopers, but what about that tarantula? ""Tarantulas hibernate when it’s cold out,"" Slovis explained. ""That tarantula was being kept warm in a box to the side. We were just hoping that he would go across the frame. Every time we let him out, he would go half way and freeze and go into is vegetative state. So we would have to take him back and warm him up."" Eventually, the little guy appears to have limbered up enough to get the job done."
breakingbad,3bm7ov,emperor_worm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:07:38 2015 UTC,I figured the temperature can drop in the desert in the winter months and evening hours but in the first couple of seasons Jesse wore a thick jacket/sweatshirt during the day in the sun. I figured it was bc he was using drugs and got pretty skinny therefore leaving him cold

breakingbad,3bk2su,dimplepinch,2,Mon Jun 29 21:32:06 2015 UTC,"That is interesting!  Thanks for sharing.  It always jumped out at me that Jesse used, correctly, the word evasive.  No way he would have said that in season 1.  He has a small vocabulary, and like many young people, limits even that out of self-consciousness. It's like he became smarter just from being around Mr. White all the time.    The way Walter talked is so perfect.  Seeing him use a word like behooves feels exactly right.  He was a smart guy with a large vocabulary, and there's little doubt that he would insist on using exactly the right word for the job (and then vociferously and sarcastically defend it if, say, some young punk gave him shit over his word choice).   I'm about six episodes into rewatching the whole series, so I'm gonna try to pay more attention to the language now.  By the way, seeing this post plus your username has me wondering if they used Dimple Pinch in the show largely because of the name.  I always assumed Gilligan was just a fan."
breakingbad,3bk2su,ArtSchnurple,2,Tue Jul 7 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"That's why I instantly loved Jesse. He has a very clearly defined 'street' vocab all throughout the series that he dropped as he changed and matured. But Season 1 Jesse using ""evasive"" correctly doesn't surprise me. It seems there are many words that are within the lexicon of the criminal game that Jesse knows far better than Walt. Evasive is applicable in that context...breakage ""like Wal-Mart, shit breaks"" and of course Walt looks to Jesse to understand Tuco's use of ""vig"" on the fronted money. So there was a ""learning curve"" that Walt cops to (IIRC in Saul's office in 211 Mandala) and we see that true even of Walt's nomenclature involving the drug life.  By the same token, in that first season once Jesse has seen the purity from Walt's cook (in addition to having a desperately needed patriarchal presence) and has Badger out in the boonies for their next cook--not only does Jesse basically mimic Walt's fastidiousness and perfectionism (correcting the same mistakes he made on his first cook) but Jesse also seems to strive to use the same language while trying to teach Badger.  Jesse does the same thing with his 'crew' while Walt began his dealing with Gus and even later when Jesse is onboard and was stealing to sell on the side with Skinny and Badger in season 3 he still seemed to be adopting the affectations of the wiser father-like-figures in his life (ie. Walt, his group leader ""totally Kafkaesque"", and later on Mike as well).  What exactly do you mean about the Dimple Pinch? Are you asking if they used the type of alcohol simply because it sounded unique? Which it does, and it's a fantastic choice purely on sound alone. But I think VG admitted on the episode commentaries  that he basically wanted Walt's liquor of choice to be whisky from the start because of Gilligan's own rabid penchant for ""a good sour mash"" or ""a smooth bourbon feel."" He goes on to say ""Jesus man sometimes I really feel like the town drunkard around the studio. But I just like a good drink. Most stereotypical men do I think and it made sense to me that Walt was a whisky man.""  In episode 107 Walt drinks dimple pinch while smoking cigars with Hank at Holly's baby shower. In 501 after cleaning up the bomb making evidence Walt again pours himself Dimple Pinch. In 502 Gomie, Merkert and Hank share a swig of Whistlepig (VG's absolute favorite). We see Whistlepig again in Hank's hands as he pours one for Walt following Walt's infamous jail hits.   Sorry for the novel of a response there. But I got all excited re-thinking about alcohol throughout the series. You and I have seen the show so many times it's those smaller details and our interpretation of them that keeps Breaking Bad alive.  Remember, ""there are two kinds of people in this life...those who drink...and those who pour...I learned that a man can never drink his fill by waiting in line at the tap."""

breakingbad,3bbl8w,modern_complexity,7,Sat Jun 27 17:37:25 2015 UTC,"When the series starts - Walt is more moral than Jesse.  When Walt kills the guy in the basement - he immediately drops down past Jesse's level of morality.  From there on, both of their morality levels drop until Jesse starts pulling away from Walt and getting better.  Walt gets pretty evil pretty quick, and Jesse gets kind of evil and then becomes good.  Rather than looking like an ""x"", I think the two lines on the graph would be all over the place - rising and falling (mostly falling)."
breakingbad,3bbl8w,ashotts,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:13:45 2015 UTC,"I think when Jesse gets decked by Hank and is in the hospital, and says that he has realized he is a bad guy, he starts to ascend back to morality. Jesse tries to accept what he has become and strive in his role, but he really does the opposite; from that point, he realizes what he's doing is wrong, and goes back"

breakingbad,3b9wc6,cheesetheknife,11,Sat Jun 27 04:31:17 2015 UTC,"http://www.npr.org/2011/09/19/140111200/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-on-meth-and-morals   Breaking Bad was created by Vince Gilligan, who previously worked as a producer and writer on The X-Files. He tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that he isn't quite sure where the idea for his critically acclaimed show came from.  ""I suspect it had something to do with the fact that when I came up with the idea for Breaking Bad, I was about to turn 40 years old, and perhaps I was thinking in terms of an impending midlife crisis,"" he says. ""To that end, I think Walter White, in the early seasons, is a man who is suffering from perhaps the world's worst midlife crisis.""   Yes, he knew he was depicting Walt as going through a mid life crisis and played around with those tropes."
breakingbad,3b9wc6,CMelody,2,Sat Jun 27 05:08:39 2015 UTC,"My point was that the car was bought on his fifty-first birthday: the exact middle of the show, timiline-wise."

breakingbad,3b8s1h,acmed,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:42:24 2015 UTC,I think the first time everyone saw that episode they thought poor old lady would meet her doom. That's what made the scene exciting.

In other threads, there's been some great analysis of what the scene means for Jesse - particularly how he's a perfectionist when pushed that way (the wooden box, for example). That said, they could have picked any famous painter that had been an equally famous perfectionist and gotten the same message across. That said, they picked Georgia O'Keefe, and her constant painting of an object that serves as a great thematic tool in the series. That just seems like too large of a coincidence to me.  I can see why people can claim that's reading too far in, but I'd like to think that was a deliberate choice."

breakingbad,3b2dq3,-MangoDown-,3,Thu Jun 25 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"Great art, be it literature, or any other medium, often evoke these parallels whether intentional or not. Or possibly not initially intentional, but realized at a later point in the creative process by the artist. Hell, the study of literature is an area of academia that literally thrives on evoking meaning - which, often, results in creating depth to a novel that may not have been there for the writer in his first, second, or tenth read through. Sometimes the meaning is there and it doesn't matter what the intent of the artist was. I'll rephrase: it does matter. But that doesn't change the creative experience from the side of the audience."

breakingbad,3ay9ti,thisishardcore_,21,Wed Jun 24 14:46:20 2015 UTC,Yes. It is definitely different than football overseas. There is no home and away sections so everyone is sitting with each other regardless of the team they are rooting for

If there was a match over here on the level of, say, Yankees vs. Red Sox there'd be a massive police presence, and probably a line of police separating the fans too. I support Leeds United, and when someone like Manchester United, Chelsea or Millwall come to town there's probably more police officers than actual fans!"

It's still his story, and in the bulk of both halves of the season, his character was still the main propulsion of plot and narrative. I think the point Gilligan was trying to make was that, rather than add a new bad guy into the story, as had happened each season, Walter had become the bad guy. Jesse had accepted that about himself a while back, but Walter had continually refused to see it, wanted to believe he was still somehow a decent guy just doing what he needed to ensure his family's security.  In season five - both A and B - he's embraced this bad guy. Hank actually is the antagonist if you are still seeing Walter as the hero, anti or otherwise. But for much of the audience, our loyalties had shifted. Hank was a good man trying to bring down a dangerous criminal. So he was now the hero - and he died a heroic death. But while we saw him in pursuit of Walter, his point-of-view was still a sideline. Jesse was more of a main character than Hank, but we only got a brief few scenes of Jesse on his own to explore his mindset (usually with no dialogue)."

As others have mentioned it can be a bit slow at times but it's still an incredible show so far, with great characters, plot and script. What I like most about it is how it has similar vibes to Breaking Bad but doesn't ride on the show's success. It's still its own story and has its own merits.  I could really go an all day about how much I like BCS, but in short, it is absolutely worth watching."

breakingbad,3asvyn,Not_Pictured,6,Tue Jun 23 14:43:30 2015 UTC,It's made in the style and budget of a soap opera. Apparently it's a pretty popular format.
breakingbad,3asvyn,AllintheBunk,3,Tue Jun 23 14:52:59 2015 UTC,"I've been doing the same thing actually.  My Spanish is decent but my comprehension isn't the best; I'd say I've already improved quite a bit just from the first few seasons.  The Colombian accent can be a little rough for me since I'm not familiar with it at all.  And a fair warning, the subtitles on Netflix are poorly done at parts but it's nothing too egregious."
breakingbad,3asvyn,The_Original_Gronkie,2,Tue Jun 23 15:25:11 2015 UTC,A Spanish speaking friend told me that Colombians speak the most proper Spanish in the Western Hemisphere. Everyone else speaks ghetto Spanish. That what she told me anyway. She's Puerto Rican.

breakingbad,3asvyn,thisishardcore_,7,Tue Jun 23 12:43:20 2015 UTC,"It's different to Breaking Bad. I wouldn't describe it as 'lighter', but it's certainly less intense and anxiety-inducing. The cinematography and music is different as well, even though it's by the same people.  It's also a lot slower. Ten episodes into Breaking Bad and so much had already happened, whereas so far in Better Call Saul there's been no real big ""holy SHIT!"" moments. It's definitely a slow burner, but still good. Bob Odenkirk is a very talented man."

breakingbad,3asvyn,EggMcFuckin,3,Tue Jun 23 13:01:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The first half of the season is good but not great, and then it really hits its stride in the second half. Episodes 6-10 were awesome...on par with Breaking Bad season 3 in terms of quality, in my opinion."
breakingbad,3asvyn,zjbrickbrick,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:22:47 2015 UTC,"My experience was the opposite of yours I guess.  I really enjoyed the first half a lot, but the second half seemed to be struggling a bit.  Nothing really ""happened""  I guess.  Still a great show though."
breakingbad,3asvyn,peroxwhyLUSH,3,Tue Jun 23 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you, but I think it had to slow down in the latter half of the season to really have viewers get invested in Saul, take the perception away we had from Breaking Bad that he was just some late night TV scumbag lawyer.   Arguably, I think it worked."
breakingbad,3asvyn,modernzen,3,Tue Jun 23 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"It's the spin-off you didn't realize you wanted until you watch it. Also, for what it's worth. it has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes."
breakingbad,3asvyn,SoloIsGodly,14,Tue Jun 23 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"Seemingly all overwhelmingly positive opinions in here, but I'll throw my hat in the ring. I found it sinfully boring and gave it at least 7 episodes. The pacing was slow, the stakes were nonexistent, the characters gave me no reason to care about them (tinfoil blanket electricity fearing man, the ol' staple that viewers can identify with), and actually did a pretty poor job introducing the characters at times too.  I'll watch the rest of it sometime this summer but after the first few weeks I just had no anticipation or hype for this show. It was just watching boring people do boring things, occasionally with a random BrBa cameo."
breakingbad,3asvyn,adelltfm,7,Tue Jun 23 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"I could not agree more. It's drastically different from BrBa in so many ways, so anyone expecting that type of show will be vastly disappointed. I think BrBa fans are more forgiving of this because they know Saul/Mike already, but it's difficult to imagine this show capturing the attention of people with no familiarity with Saul/Mike already. I stuck it out and watched the whole season, but I felt disappointed after every episode when yet again nothing happened. I'll give season 2 a try though. I'm hoping they just wanted to get all of the background nonsense out of the way and the good stuff will happen now."
breakingbad,3asvyn,salmonhelmet,6,Tue Jun 23 16:19:18 2015 UTC,I'm with you guys. I liked it because of character familiarity but it was frustratingly slow paced. I did like the surprises. You think they are going to go one lame way and they the sneak in a curve ball. They have work to do season 2 to make me a real fan though.
breakingbad,3asvyn,superbek,2,Tue Jun 23 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"I completely understand what you're saying but I definitely think you should keep watching. Do you know who tinfoil blanket man is?

breakingbad,3asvyn,peroxwhyLUSH,2,Tue Jun 23 16:32:26 2015 UTC,It's a definite yes from me. The way it's written and the way all the scenes are done is outstanding and gives much needed background to characters you didn't know much about from Breaking Bad (like why was Mike trying to leave his granddaughter all that money?)   Gilligan is doing very well with it. And he's created a whole different universe and made Saul into a pretty awesome character.

The writing and plotting feels much more meandering than it did in BB. It definitely lacks the kind of urgent character motives and drive that Walter White brought to the story, Jimmy McGill is a much more ambiguous character I think. I don't consider the time spent wasted but I don't know that I'll stick around for S2."
breakingbad,3asvyn,iBaconized,0,Tue Jun 23 16:22:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. Watched the first half of season 1, and I just eventually got bored. I didn't want to watch a show about Saul becoming a successfully lawyer, I wanted dangerous situations and lots of action."
breakingbad,3asvyn,DaRizat,3,Tue Jun 23 17:02:19 2015 UTC,"Saul as the main character doesn't scream action, but there were some really intense scenes. Him talking Tuco out of killing those skateboarders was as good a scene as any and Mike's backstory episode was amazing to me. I would put it up there with some of the better BrBa eps.   I think in season 2 seeing Mike and Saul come together and even potentially seeing Mike start to hook up with Gus and build that empire would be super amazing. There is so much potential in this show. I hope that it delivers."
breakingbad,3asvyn,freckles88,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:49:40 2015 UTC,"It's definitely worth watching. As others have said, it's a different concept from Br Ba.

breakingbad,3avrxe,GauisjuliusCaesar,12,Wed Jun 24 07:11:37 2015 UTC,"Probably letting Jane die. He didn't let her die because he cared for Jessie, he let her die because he needed him."
breakingbad,3avrxe,I_LIKE_YOU_,9,Tue Jun 23 22:16:33 2015 UTC,"I took this differently.  Jane had just informed Walter that she knew all about their drug business, his family, his wife, his children and whatever else he had done.  As a result, Walter went into damage control, because this woman who had the means to destroy him just threatened him and his family.  Sure this was different from Gus directly threatening to kill his family, but the premise is same; Walter will do whatever he believes necessary to protect his family, at least at this point in the story.  Letting Jane choke to death was brutal, but consistent with the ""us or them"" mentality Walter is driven by throughout the show."
breakingbad,3avrxe,InvisibroBloodraven,4,Wed Jun 24 15:55:21 2015 UTC,"The only reason Jane said that was to stand up for Jessie. She (correctly) felt that he was being manipulated and threatened by Walt. Of course it's a grey area, but I think getting rid of her was more about keeping things running smoothly more so than his family. Family came second to the business, as seen later when he misses his daughter's birth to make the deadline."
breakingbad,3avrxe,I_LIKE_YOU_,2,Wed Jun 24 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"The only reason Jane said that was to stand up for Jessie.    Yes, but does Walter know that?  Because the answer to that question is important in determining his level of villainy.   Family came second to the business   I would argue that it did not at this point, but that is also quite a blanket statement.  There is a difference between missing your child's birthday and allowing a woman to bring you and your family down in a criminal conspiracy that would totally ruin their lives.  We know from Jane's perspective that her intentions were not nearly as malicious, but I think it is a bit of a stretch to assume Walt knows that, not being privy to what we know as watchers."
breakingbad,3avrxe,InvisibroBloodraven,5,Wed Jun 24 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"plus, she got Jesse on heroin (at least as far as he knows). I don't think Walt trusted her in any capacity."

breakingbad,3asyqf,1TrueKingInTheNorth,21,Tue Jun 23 06:55:54 2015 UTC,"No. Walt is looking out for himself and that's it. For example, the dude fucking makes meth for a living. Who knows how many lives and families he ruined doing that? And yet he appears to not care about that at all.   He's totally capable of having a heartfelt moment with someone that he relates to. He's capable of that because he sees himself in them, it's not because he cares about them; he only cares about himself. He let Jane die because her death benefited him. He'd let or kill anyone if their death benefited him.   Yeah, he felt remorse. A human monster is still a human. Fucking killing someone and subsequently crying at their funeral doesn't make one moral."
breakingbad,3asyqf,NewMerril,4,Tue Jun 23 07:04:40 2015 UTC,"Good answer, I have to agree. Follow-up question though: if he had known letting her die would inadvertently cause two planes to crash together and kill 167 people (168 if you include her dad's suicide) would he have saved her then?   I think you're answer will still be the same since again he doesn't know the people (like those whose lives are ruined buying his meth) so he doesn't really care, plus he can use the crash as an excuse and cover up for some of his actions but I'm still curious what you think"
breakingbad,3asyqf,ErikEzrin,5,Tue Jun 23 07:29:53 2015 UTC,"I think if he could turn back time... with the knowledge he has after her death (how much Jesse blames HIMSELF for her death, the plane crash... all caused by her death) he wouldn't have let her die.   He basically says it straight out in Fly. ""If only I could have lived up to that moment, not have gone to your house... and not a second more, that would have been perfect.""  I don't think he so much regrets JANE's death, but I think he definitely DOES regret what happened BECAUSE of her death badly enough to spare her life... and maybe even wish he could turn back time."
breakingbad,3asyqf,NewMerril,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:51:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he may care. But he doesn't care enough to compromise his own well-being.

I can't imagine Walt thinking:   If I do this then 150+ people will die, therefore I won't do it."

breakingbad,3aqrbc,DabuSurvivor,3,Tue Jun 23 05:37:56 2015 UTC,They didn't say anything about how the poison itself got to Brock.
breakingbad,3aqrbc,darthstupidious,26,Tue Jun 23 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"1.) I wish that Todd's Neo-Nazi crew was more expanded upon. Gus was a villain that was built up over multiple seasons, and his death was incredibly satisfying for us as the viewers. But the Neo-Nazis were basically introduced to be the final villains and to be as typical ""bad guy"" as possible, so I didn't really feel any satisfaction when Walt took them out... it was just like, ""that's cool,"" which you shouldn't feel when somebody uses an automated machine gun to level a building. Let's just say that it was nothing like Walt learning Gus's weakness and hitting him where it hurt. I was pretty much rooting for some sort of redemption for Jesse at that point.   2.) I wish the character development for Skylar was more subdued. I know the arguments for her character and why her choices made sense in the moment, but it seems like the first few seasons jump between her being an absentee wife barely there for her husband, to a great mother that just wants what's best for her family and Walt, to a suspicious mind that sleeps with Ted immediately. I just wish that her character jumped between her different roles more fluidly, or had an even-paced character. Just a little annoyance I had with the show, and I think the biggest reason the fanbase is so divided on how they view her.   3.) I wish that Walt hadn't been given a ""happy ending."" I wanted the show to end with him as a scumbag, burning and fraying every relationship he once had, honestly. I was so hooked with the show being about a man ""breaking bad,"" and I feel that him feeling bad about it at the last minute and wanting some redemption, no matter how slight, went against the character development that he had been given. Just my opinion, of course, but I wanted to see him end in full Scarface-territory. I didn't hate the ending, but I feel like ""Ozymandias"" was the true ending whereas the final two episodes were more of a epilogue."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,Vkmies,22,Mon Jun 22 20:42:59 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything but point 3. I know, this is pure opinion talk, but I think it was perfect character development for Walt. It made sense. They managed to fit so much growth in his last moments as realistically possible and I personally felt an incredible connection to that.   But I won't dispute that Ozymandias is probably the greatest hour to ever be shown on television in the history of ever."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,PeterM76,2,Mon Jun 22 22:38:30 2015 UTC,"I'm new to the show and just watched Ozymandias last night.  It was certainly one of the best things I have ever watched - film, television or play.  The scene where he's on the phone talking to Skyler and he's saying what he has to say to get the cops off of her but he's crying with the anguish in his eyes- when he realizes that everything went wrong and he lost everything he wanted (which he already had in S1E1).  I can't think of anything more powerful than that one scene."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,rusty_blumpkin,6,Fri Jul 10 18:29:55 2015 UTC,I don't agree about how you think it should have ended but I agree the last two eps felt more like an epilogue.
breakingbad,3aqrbc,DabuSurvivor,4,Tue Jun 23 00:28:44 2015 UTC,"But Walt was the absentee one who wasn't there for her. We see that even in the very first episode where he comes back in in the middle of the night and she says that he shouldn't leave her out of things, in the second episode he's a dick to her when they find out Holly's sex. (Granted some of her S1 characterization might be a little out of play with even the characterization of the next season, but you can say the same about Hank, Marie, Jesse, and even Flynn to an extent.)  And sleeping with Ted wasn't an immediate thing or based on suspicion; it was after she'd known definitively for quite a while that he'd been getting money from strange sources, which she waited two months to bring up until he'd recovered from his surgery, and had had confirmation that he'd been making methamphetamine. Throughout all of I.F.T., it's built up how powerless Skyler is: she can't keep Walt out of the home, she can't bring herself to turn him into the police. She has no options, but then in the last scene she manages to hit him where it hurts and let him know that even if he's in the house, their relationship isn't what he wants it to be. I don't think it was particularly abrupt at all.  Definitely agreed on point #3."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,Vikingofthehill,4,Tue Jun 23 15:23:18 2015 UTC,"I'll admit, I am biased. I just stated Breaking Bad was perfect, so going into this I have to disagree with you. But I'll make my case by responding to your points.  1.) Unlike Gus who had a huge franchise and an intriguing past, the neo-nazi crew were really just mindless speed abusers/sellers. You can literally find people exactly like this in tons of places in the real world. They don't have an interesting back story as a group, it's all individuals who has failed at life / been influenced by their failed parents to be neonazis who just happened to make money selling meth.  2.) Skylar epitomizes the beautiful character development rollercoaster that Breaking Bad was. In the beginning virtually everyone saw her as a bitch. The stereotypical demanding and commanding wife who has eaten her husbands soul away over the years. Just like on the opposite side of the spectrum Walt was this poor guy everyone had deep sympathy for because it was so painfully obvious that he deserved so much more. In the same way Walt deteriorated to the point where you were almost forced to hate his sociopathic ways, but still sort of rooted for the good guy in him, Skylar emerged as a stand up woman with flaws. They complimented each other's characters quite well. At the time she cheated on Walt she had literally been through hell with Walt, not that it 'excuses' it, but it explains the suddeness of it. It had been built up for so long.  3.) If Walt had gone full sociopath it would break with his entire character development. When people decide to take a 'final decision' ( achieve goal by suicide ) they tend to summarise their life. We see this with even crazy spree killers, they feel the need to justify the actions for themselves and everyone around. So it was quite natural that Walt, at the end of his hellish journey, would try to end it on a 'good note'. Remember that all along he was convinced he was doing 'the right thing' and saving his family, without realizing that he was really just fertilizing his ego that had withered since college. Also, he didn't really get redemption. The destruction in his wake is 100% beyond repair. There was not one person left whom Walt's actions did not directly/indirectly annihiliate the soul of."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,Secretmapper,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:15:50 2015 UTC,"I like your third point so much! When I was watching and Walt made his ""What do you do in this partnership"" speech to Jesse, I was like, yeah what the hell just do it all alone.  And when he did it in season 5 and get fucked up in Ozymandias, it was a great realisation, you don't just remove every relationship you have."

It explains various flawed plots (starting with Marie's shoplifting) and makes arguments for how the show later made them more meaningful. Worth reading I'd say."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,El_Fake_Slim_Shady,3,Tue Jun 23 14:19:15 2015 UTC,"I thought this as well, but then if you actually look into it, it turns out to be one of the biggest plot lines in the whole story AND is the reason Walt gets caught by Hank. Basically, this is why:  Marie is shoplifting in season 1. Then it ends. Well, that was pointless.  But then Marie is stealing again, in season 4, in the Open House episode where she is accused of stealing from the houses.  Then when she is arrested she gets away because Hank asks for a favour from the friend of his in the police or whatever.  In return for this favour the friend asks Hank to have a look at Gale Boettichers case file.  Then of course Hank makes the connection in season 5 that the other WW is Walter White in the book from Gale.  Tl;dr: Marie getting caught shoplifting means Hank gets the Gale case file which means he realises Walt is Heisenberg"
breakingbad,3aqrbc,dimplepinch,7,Tue Jul 7 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"It's hard to believe for me that after the events of 410 Salud that there was no cartel blowback. Gus may have wiped out the cartel's leadership but it seemed to me that there should have been an episode that ties up the change in power south of the border (and possibly gives us a little more of Gus's past in SA).   To me, I really didn't care nearly enough about the Neo Nazis as the main antagonists in Season 5. I really thought that the cartel would be. It'd be cool if they kidnapped Mike while he was recovering in Mexico and Jesse or Walt have to save him. It would have been awesome if Walt's first real quest for empire was more analogous to Gus's rise to power.   Or if it wouldn't be the cartel than I would have much preferred Madrigal to become a horribly villianous, corporate German mafia organization who wants to bring the blue international (like Lydia eventually).  Just some fun things to think about. I ain't actually complaining."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,CoachChris,6,Mon Jun 22 21:15:17 2015 UTC,"I would add one little shot at the end of Jesse driving past a sign that says ""Welcome to Alaska"".  The dude is royally shafted at the end of the series.  He has no money, his girlfriends are both dead, he will never see Brock again, he thoroughly burned the bridge with his parents, he has nothing."

Jane's dad wouldn't have been allowed to man a screen so soon, and he'd be supervised for a good half year after coming back to specifically ensure this didn't happen.  ATC takes human-factor stuff very seriously. The thought that this could happen is laughable in and of itself, especially when you consider that the pilots have TCAS, and the alarms on Donald's console would have had everyone trying to help him well before the planes were in real danger.  It's a shame that they didn't consult with anybody who talks to planes as part of writing that script."

breakingbad,3aqrbc,CMelody,7,Wed Jun 24 23:22:30 2015 UTC,"The only thing that bothered me is how Mike left Walt ziptied to the radiator in Buyout.  He spent all night with Walt and he knew he had that meeting with the police the next day...he is so cautious and he knows how sneaky Walt is, so I don't buy for a second that his character would leave Walt unattended like that.  He would have had one of his guys or Jesse watch Walt while he left the scene.  I wish they'd written the scene so that Mike's meeting with the police was a last minute surprise - then he'd have no choice but to leave Walt behind.  There were a lot of things in the show that truly disturbed me, but I don't think I would have changed any of the outcomes, not even Jesse's horrible servitude or the murder of Andrea, because even though it was bleak it all fit into the overall story."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,Seiyith,4,Mon Jun 22 21:53:21 2015 UTC,"Mike leaving one of his guys? Maybe. No chance on Jesse. He belonged to Walt and probably would have unchained him himself. Hell, when Mike gets pissed at him right after Jesse is the one to stop him"
breakingbad,3aqrbc,KidCasey,8,Tue Jun 23 00:57:38 2015 UTC,"I would have made Skylar a little more involved in Walt's business. I know she worked the car wash and laundered his money, but I think one of the best parts involving her is when she acted like a total bimbo to keep Ted from going under.   I would've liked to see her use her manipulative side to help out Walt. It could have involved her throwing Hank intentionally off the trail or just trying to intimidate more people for Walt. Hell, she could've even used the dumb secretary bit again to lure Walt's enemies into a trap or some shit.   It would've been great to see her start to enjoy ruining lives as much as Walt and then realizing she's becoming a monster too.   But I am biased, I like stories where the bad guy wins."

breakingbad,3aqrbc,Secretmapper,2,Wed Jun 24 13:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I liked everything with what they've done with it (shows how manipulative Gus is, the whole gus vs cartel and the hank plot line) but the scene itself I view is a lone anomaly in an otherwise relatively believable show.  It's as close to me realising that the writers were 'winging' it (and I learned they wrote season 3 as it ran)"
breakingbad,3aqrbc,InvisibroBloodraven,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:24:43 2015 UTC,"Their whole persona was silly to me.  Two mysterious and silent brothers go around killing people, while wearing pink cowboy boots with super badass skulls on the ends of them, killing people for no reason with an axe, all to just ultimately try and kill Hank in the dumbest leap of logic to put the blame on him in the first place.  Then, Hank shoots the body armor, which causes no reaction, and the guy ends up being able to kill Hank but goes back for the axe?  No anger or bloodlust, instead just pure composure so you can add a track that ratchets up the suspense so he can come back and be killed by Hank?    The twins were fucking dumb and the weakest point of the show to me; in their writing, style, feel and execution.  They were comic book cringe worthy.  Maybe they were cooler to people who did not binge the show, that way their mysteriousness was a slow-burn, but for me, it was laughable, at best."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,Secretmapper,3,Wed Jun 24 17:53:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It was one of the obvious things that showed the writers were winging it in season 3.

breakingbad,3aqrbc,CMelody,9,Mon Jun 22 19:58:57 2015 UTC,"I think that aspect made him out to be what I think he was overall, a decent guy who just got caught up in a really turbulent lifestyle and who was manipulated endlessly by a sociopath."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,Vkmies,15,Tue Jun 23 00:30:56 2015 UTC,"Everyone has a right to their opinion, but why are Jesse's emotions annoying?  Personally I thought it was rather refreshing to show a guy that conflicted about all the violence he witnessed.  Too often criminals are portrayed as hardened and heartless, so it was an interesting change of pace to see one actually traumatized by all the murders."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,PandaDerZwote,12,Mon Jun 22 21:57:45 2015 UTC,"I loved this about Jesse. How quickly he moved from the ""Yo Yo Gangsta""-kid to a completely broken person because he faced actual danger and actual loss. I wish they actually made that growth slower, it was one of my favourite parts in the show, when this hard-ass poser gangsta kid is forced to basically help in a murder in the first season. That was golden television."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,b3ggo,4,Mon Jun 22 22:40:29 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with Jesse being conflicted and torn apart emotionally; what was annoying was the extent of Jesse's actual sobbing. Of course we expect him to be emotional, but I think that in the effort to make Jesse ""the Heart"" of the show, they relied too heavily on Aaron Paul's face shrink wrapped in tears. Walt cried. Gus cried. Most characters had their moment and in Breaking Bad, the moments were amazing. However, Jesse really, really cried. A lot.  I just thought that those moments when Jesse was clear-eyed, Aaron Paul was still able to show the deep inner conflict, without breaking down into sobbing tears."

breakingbad,3aqrbc,PandaDerZwote,6,Mon Jun 22 22:43:59 2015 UTC,"People really give that episode more shit than it deserves. There are some dialogue moments I actually really liked in Fly. For one, Walt almost slips up and admits that he watched Jane die, but doses off before completely saying it. This allows it to be a much more mean spirited admission of guilt in Season 5. Plus, it has one of Walt's most poignant pieces of dialogue he says. Where he talks about himself missing the ""perfect moment"" to die, while his family will still miss him and think of him fondly. Which later turns out to be true."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,ItsSansom,2,Tue Jun 23 15:33:17 2015 UTC,"I really think it could have been done better though. Yeah, there is some great dialogue, and the episode really shows a lot about Walt's character. They could have had that same dialogue and those same characteristics, in a story that was actually interesting though. Kind of like ""4 Days Out"". It develops the characters in a lot of ways and shows Walt's determination when situations get dire, but the story of the episode is interesting too.  The developments we see in ""Fly"" could have had just something extra to make it easier to watch I think. I had the patience for the slow parts of the show, but I felt like a whole episode had been wasted there."
breakingbad,3aqrbc,ZTheCapn_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"I liked it, really.

breakingbad,3aqrbc,cth1ic_warrior,3,Wed Jun 24 13:13:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think a whole episode dedicated to that was really needed though. I mean, we got that from when he insisted that he HAD to fix the ""rot"" under the house. We knew he was a perfectionist already.

Felina felt like too much stuff going too well for Walt. I feel like the writers became ""Team Walt"" in the final hour and started to want a more traditionally satisfying ending than was typical for the show. I really don't dig the scene with Gretchen/Elliott. It's uncomfortable to watch him be such a prick to them and feels like it kind of retroactively validates his view of Gray Matter, and I think him getting to leave money to his family kind of undermines a lot of what was set up throughout the first 60 episodes - the inability to reconcile his Heisenberg meth stuff with his family life. Andrea's death was acted really well by Aaron Paul (like every other scene) and it makes sense plot-wise, but it feels a little rushed for her. What I often loved about BrBa is how it showed the fallout of actions, but here we have this super likable woman just getting shot and can assume her young son is going to stumble upon her corpse, which is really fucking dark, and we see absolutely none of it. Wish we'd seen how Brock was poisoned and how Walt managed to get into his house in Felina."

breakingbad,3amee5,spongedcube,6,Sun Jun 21 17:29:41 2015 UTC,"1). While Walt says it's basic chemistry, Walt is also an anal retentive clean freak that is super fastidious in making sure there are no adulterants and he gets the highest purity. You must also remember that this is Walter White cooking using a pseudo process..not yet a P2P cook. So a chemically pure product from a pseudo cook is a harder thing to accomplish.   2). I don't know WHY Krazy 8 was a snitch...but he is. AND EMILIO DIDN'T KNOW IT. If you recall after Krazy bailed him out, Emilio was convinced that Jesse (not Krazy) was the one who dimed on him. If the DEA had something leveraged against Krazy 8 that would explain his ratting. Or perhaps he wanted Emilio and/or Jesse out of business so he could take over. All we can do is speculate at this point."
breakingbad,3amee5,dimplepinch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"Good answer.   Though one thing, you say: ""a chemically pure product from a pseudo cook is a harder thing to accomplish"" I am not a chemist myself, nor do I know much about cooking meth, BUT from what I DO know that is actually wrong. It's the other way around.  A pseudo cook is chemically the way easier method, but it has a big downside, namely that it's near impossible to get large quantities. However, a P2P cook is more complex (because the molecule is 'less complete' already, compared to pseudo), and also yields a 50:50 racemic mix of both the enatiomers of meth (""If our reaction isn't stereospecific, how can our product be entiomerically pure?""), which means that it might be (nearly) a 100% pure... but only 50% ACTIVE. For it to be truly the astounding product Walt delivers, he has to have discovered some yet unknown way to make an entiomerically pure product with the P2P method, but that would presumably only make the process more complex...  P2P isn't a ""better"" method than a pseudo cook or anything. Pseudo is still the main method used nowadays -over P2P- and that's for a reason. But they HAD to switch if they wanted to upscale their 'operation'... due to limited supply of pseudo."

breakingbad,3aj3kg,Honky_Cat,5,Sat Jun 20 22:30:13 2015 UTC,It's my argument that the federales or some enforcement agency would be at Gus's cartel wipeout very quickly and therefore could have gotten to the evidence before any other cartel underlings could get to or have reason to destroy jesses footage.
breakingbad,3aj3kg,HairyCarey,5,Sun Jun 21 03:01:58 2015 UTC,"I agree but shortly after this Gus turns on the cartel and flees. If it were ""cartely"" to turn evidence over to the authorities then someone at the lab with access to this could possibly do it.

I highly doubt that video lasted very long. Gus would have paid someone off to destroy it, if need be. The last thing he would want is another cartel getting their hands on Walter's formula.   I figured we were supposed to assume that, otherwise they would have gone back to it. Don Eladio and his capos were all poisoned, but the chemists would have hightailed it out of there with that video in their hot little hands as soon as they heard. We never did get to see just how far away the lab was from Vuente's property, but I would imagine it was enough of a distance, and obviously, with the chicas that were hustling out of there, news would have traveled very quickly.   But I am pretty sure Gus took care of that detail in his Gus-way."
breakingbad,3aj3kg,457undead,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:48:23 2015 UTC,A good point. Though I think it would be hard to convince a cartel loyalist to flip on his organization and do that for Gus. It is a logical explanation and I get that everything doesn't have to happen on screen. I just wished that they showed a quick scene of Mike after he wakes up in Mexico and he tracks down and cleans up whatever evidence that's left. Or at least shown us that Gus bought off a federale or something.

breakingbad,3aktf4,eva_brauns_team,2,Sat Jul 18 02:42:54 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was mostly for show. In other words, as soon as Walter went to Gus to rat out Jesse and his plan, Gus made it his purpose to suddenly establish a connection with 'his men' who were oh, so very valuable to him, when in all likelihood, he couldn't care less about either of them and considered them disposable. He was eyeing the long game, however, as per usual. He didn't trust Jesse and he wanted him out of the way, so the dealers were his solution to that. He predicted that Jesse wouldn't be able to 'keep the peace'. I still haven't decided whether Gus gave the order to have Tomas killed, though."
breakingbad,3aktf4,dimplepinch,2,Mon Jun 22 02:43:24 2015 UTC,"""I've made it no secret that I do business with certain local dealers and manufacturers."" Gus to Juan Bolsa  IIRC ""The cartel needs Gus. They need his distrubution.""  So up until Gus makes his move with the cousins and the superlab with Walt cooking, Gus was doing business and selling on the side with the two dealers and likely more. He calls them ""my trusted employees"" and then proceeds to give Walt credit for the respect he has for him. Gus knew that this new operation with Walt and the superlab would replace any need for street dealing. Gus knew the cousins and Hank shootout would ""cut off the flow of methamphetamine to the Southwest."" And so we see Gus starting to use his Pollos distrubution for the blue rather than the cartel's product and thus his need for these local dealers is quickly vanishing. So he uses them as a gesture to Walt and hopefully to rid him of Jesse. He knew that Tomas meant something to Jesse so I wouldn't be surprised if Gus ordered the death of Tomas knowing Jesse's reaction would cause a standoff and kill two birds with one stone.  TLDR: I wouldn't be surprised if that meeting in 312 Half Measures was the first time the dealers had met Gus and given the ramp up of his operation with Walt and the superlab, these dealers were likely on their way out anyway."

breakingbad,3af884,enough_space,10,Fri Jun 19 20:36:00 2015 UTC,I thought the second picture was to show how false the first one was. It's so easy to sell what is hands down the best product in the industry. You hardly need to be a good salesman to sell their blue meth
breakingbad,3af884,Lilrev16,32,Fri Jun 19 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"To a methhead, sure, but there were no real telling signs that the gas station girl was a junkie. Think about it, do you think you could just stroll into any random gas station, slap a bag of meth on the table and say ""hey I want to pay for my $100+ worth of gas with this""?"
breakingbad,3af884,enough_space,21,Fri Jun 19 21:42:19 2015 UTC,"I think the implication is that the Blue is so well known that when he shows it to her, she knows exactly what it is."
breakingbad,3af884,iepartytracks,16,Fri Jun 19 21:50:32 2015 UTC,And? I wouldn't buy meth no matter how well known or pure it is... Ya know? Like most people who don't do meth?
breakingbad,3af884,Insinuative_Penguin,-1,Sat Jun 20 04:35:30 2015 UTC,"What if you got lost in the eyes (or face, tits, abs whathaveyou) of the member of the opposite sex who was offering it to you? A beautiful man or women who is also around your age, out of money and pleading for your help all the while flirting?   I'd take the meth just cause a beautiful person wanted my help and it could have also been an invitation to party with them."
breakingbad,3af884,Lilrev16,2,Sat Jun 20 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"She hadn't heard of jack shit ""I mean I smoke pot like...a lot. I like to party..."" she barely even knew what meth was much less it's effects, much less that there was some incredibly pure product that everyone and their mother knew about."
breakingbad,3af884,NazzerDawk,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:51:34 2015 UTC,Didn't realize it was the gas station scene. That's the only scene in the show that suggests he's a good salesman that I can think of. Everything else is really just the fact that you'd have to be an idiot to buy from anyone else. It's like if I told you (and had evidence) that I had bacon that came from a real pig that tasted way better than regular bacon and has fewer calories and cholesterol. Who would buy any other bacon?
breakingbad,3af884,whynotboidzerg,14,Mon Jun 22 23:01:28 2015 UTC,"They are both examples of Jesse ""selling"" something. Himself, in the first image, and some blue meth to a gas station employee to trade for gas. In both cases, he demonstrates exceptional skill at selling."
breakingbad,3af884,TheNotoriousLogank,8,Fri Jun 19 20:36:06 2015 UTC,"Shit I thought it was saying he sucks at selling because his main description is ""it's awesome."" I thought this was illustrating that their meth is so well know , he can sell it to a non methhead even though he sucks at selling"
breakingbad,3af884,gaflar,3,Sat Jun 20 01:10:37 2015 UTC,Effective selling is based on knowing enough about your potential customer. Some people need to hear different things to be sold. So what sells one person may not sell another; hence good salesmanship is really a business of knowing people. The merchandise is secondary.
breakingbad,3af884,Nobody_home,8,Sat Jun 20 15:29:11 2015 UTC,"Well, his sales pitch in the first episode seemed a little fishy to me. As that interviewer my immediate reaction would be ""drug dealer"" and offer him the arrow-spinning job, just like Badger."

breakingbad,3af884,ronjon9,4,Sat Jun 20 00:38:14 2015 UTC,Jesse saying had a history in sales was just him stretching the truth about being a drug dealer. There's no need to connect the line to another scene because we already understood what he meant.

breakingbad,3ajggj,tetsuooooooooooo,4,Sat Jun 20 21:04:25 2015 UTC,He knew that she would drag Jesse down with her and they both would overdose on heroin sooner or later. Letting her choke to death saved Jesse from her.
breakingbad,3ajggj,Nealster,12,Sat Jun 20 21:16:43 2015 UTC,"I used to think the same thing. Regardless I thought Jane was a bitch, but before she met Jesse she was in rehab and sober, as far as I could tell. Jesse was the one who got her hooked again."
breakingbad,3ajggj,axel_val,5,Sat Jun 20 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"They were both recovering addicts, so they were both leaning on each other in an unhealthy way, from how I interpreted it.  But instead they just slowly sank together."
breakingbad,3ajggj,HighZenDurp,4,Sat Jun 20 23:32:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i kinda get that. It also means Jesse is now fully dependant on Walter again."
breakingbad,3ajggj,HyperactiveToast,5,Sat Jun 20 21:30:01 2015 UTC,Her name is Apology Girl
breakingbad,3ajggj,SupaHotTrainer,2,Sat Jun 20 21:56:50 2015 UTC,"Weird how you should say that, I wanted Walt to leave her to die. Jane was blackmailing him and manipulating Jesse, I didn't like her. The Walt+Jesse duo is something I want to succeed!"
breakingbad,3ajggj,ErikEzrin,5,Mon Jun 22 17:12:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah basically, it is also made as a point by Walter White later in the series. Jane had a grasp on Jesse thay Walt did not like, through her, Jesse sought to escape the drug syndicate and enjoy his life. Jane took control over Jesses money, and clearly had more influence on him than Walt did. Walt let her die to retain his grasp over Jesse, and help to expand his operation. Had Jane sirvived, the series as a whole would be far different then when it became."
breakingbad,3ajggj,ErikEzrin,2,Sun Jun 21 14:15:59 2015 UTC,"If Jesse hadn't got Jane hooked again, and they wouldn't have dragged each other into a pithole of drug addiction, eventually causing Jane's death... they might have moved to New Zealand or something... and Jane would do her art and shit, and Jesse could be a bush pilot.  Such a happy life they would have had."
breakingbad,3ajggj,j9899n,2,Sun Jun 21 21:52:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he did.   She was blackmailing him for the money (and might then still expose his 'business'), and also dragging Jesse down in addiction even more. I think at the moment he didn't consciously decide ""I'm gonna stand by coldly, doing nothing"", he actually rushed over to her side, but then the realisation hit him that it would be a very ""fortunate"" coincidence for him if she died.  You just see the conflict on his face (props to Cranston for the acting. Again). And I don't think he ever DECIDED to let her die, but it just happened because he waited too long. Like:  ""OH FUCK! She's dying! I have to save her!""  ""Oh but wait... she's blackmailing me and poisoning Jesse. I hate this girl.""  ""BUT SHE'S STILL SO YOUNG! Jesus... but... I need to save her. But... NO! She's a bad influence...!""  Jane dies  ""DAMN IT. TOO LATE.""  Then he gets over it fairly quickly. Obviously because her death WAS convenient for him, and he didn't really like her or anything... and she's dead already. It's not like he can bring her back by feeling bad. Though I think he DOES feel bad, not as much for her death as for making Jesse believe he caused it though."
breakingbad,3ajggj,3catva,2,Sun Jun 21 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"Yep. But in the original script, he gives her another dose of heroin to make her OD but they thought that was too dark."

breakingbad,3af8uy,DabuSurvivor,3,Sat Jun 20 11:03:48 2015 UTC,I lost my shit when he started looking for the money and I realized what the point of the S4 Ted arc was. Absolutely everything came together perfectly there and he just freaking broke.
breakingbad,3af8uy,ErikEzrin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:53:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. I kinda get that though, lol.

breakingbad,3af8uy,methhead86,15,Fri Jun 19 23:58:52 2015 UTC,"I fully agree.  Of course season 5 was awesome, but season four was a climax for basically every season before that.  Season five is a different bread because it's no longer him making a name for himself or dealing with a competitor, it's more just how he rises and falls within the empire.  Now I know he does have competitors in season 5 and it does take a minute to get the business going again, but it's still a very different vibe and story than the previous seasons.  It feels very separate to me.  Again, still an amazing season, but for me you can't beat season 4."
breakingbad,3af8uy,methhead86,10,Fri Jun 19 18:18:35 2015 UTC,"My favorite episodes of the entire series are 4 Days Out, Ozymandias and Crawl Space/End Times/Face Off. I never watch the last three separate, always back to back. Because they're just that great as a whole.  Props to the beginning of Season 5 though. The last thing we saw of Walt was an exhausted, relieved, triumphant ""I won.""... and then he's at Denny's, broken down, looking like death and on the run, giving the last of his money to the waitress after buying a trunk full of vengeance.  I was working at Denny's as a server when 'Live Free or Die' first aired. Suddenly everyone was aware that Denny's gave a free birthday slam. At least three times a week... ""Dude, is that free birthday meal on Breaking Bad a real thing?"""

breakingbad,3af8uy,DabuSurvivor,7,Fri Jun 19 18:48:18 2015 UTC,"I think the earlier seasons, 1 and 2, are criminally underrated. People act like it was slow and not really Breaking Bad then, but it was great in a whole different way, with more humor and good high jinks with Walt and Jesse. In seasons 4/5, it was good TV but kind of depressing how badly their relationship deteriorated. Do people honestly like sullen, depressed, self-loathing, bulked up buzz-cut Jesse Pinkman more than the fun-loving, hilarious one of season 2? That alone actually makes 1 and 2 the most enjoyable (watchable) seasons in my opinion. S4 had an ending that can't be matched but seemingly a lot of time-wasting leading up to it, an episode about Walt purchasing a gun, Open House, etc."
breakingbad,3af8uy,SleepTactic,4,Sat Jun 20 00:39:51 2015 UTC,"The total character evolution is really what does the show for me. I don't have a ""favorite"" season.

breakingbad,3af8uy,DabuSurvivor,3,Sat Jun 20 20:12:24 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that seasons 1 and 2 are underrated, though I don't agree either that they're altogether lighter. I mean, they are, but not in their entirety: Phoenix/ABQ are about as consistently tragic as Ozymandias. ABQ is honestly right up there with Ozy for my favorite episode of the series; it's a perfect conclusion to everything that came before it. Honestly, I think season two might be my favorite one. (...might.)"
breakingbad,3af8uy,SirMothy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:57:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not lighter (see: spoiler but they spruced in a lot more obvious, frequent humor to balance it out.

breakingbad,3af8uy,OnusDefacto,7,Fri Jun 19 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"The train heist is great. Jesse overall just really shines in the first half of Season 5, which makes his emotional state in the second half that much harder to watch.  ....and the cliffhanger.....  ""....heh. You got me!'"
breakingbad,3af8uy,seducer4real,3,Fri Jun 19 19:37:50 2015 UTC,Season four is my favorite season because of the episode Salud. It provided a depth to Gus and enabled us to see what he has had to do to keep his empire. I view season four as the conclusion of the primary antagonist whereas season five is more about Walter and Heisenberg. Season five is a season of repercussions.
breakingbad,3af8uy,thisishardcore_,4,Fri Jun 19 21:03:05 2015 UTC,"It also explains why Gus would take Gale's word to hire Walt, just for that 3% differential in purity. He needs the absolute best product he can produce to get back into the fold with Don Eladio."
breakingbad,3af8uy,ItsStevoHooray,3,Fri Jun 19 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"Right there with you. I still hold Season Four above all others. It was a spectacular season.   Season five was the beginning of the end, whereas in Four I was still rooting for Walt, even though I loved Gus's character and also rooted for Jesse to get the hell away from Walt. But from Problem Dog on to Face Off, that was some incredibly thrilling television right there. And the relationships in that season still held some hope. I loved Skyler and Walt working together, I loved the arc Jesse got and how he was caught between Walt and Gus. I loved Hank being driven around by Walt for 'investigative' work into Walt's illegal side job and the wonderful little chats they had. And of course, there was the growing relationship between Jesse and Mike, which - LOVE.   I love season four so hard that some days, I pretend the series finished after ""I won"". Before I had to witness Mike's demise, Hank's demise, Jesse's torture and enslavement, and the dissolution of Walter's family."
breakingbad,3af8uy,thisishardcore_,6,Sat Jun 20 03:38:48 2015 UTC,There's some great (albeit heartbreaking) revelations about Mike in Episodes 6 and 7 of Better Call Saul that cast his whole relationship with Jesse in a new light.

breakingbad,3ae3a9,Ryanmcmillan2,23,Fri Jun 19 11:30:08 2015 UTC,They want you to think that two really important people died. Presumably Walt Jr. And Sky.
breakingbad,3ae3a9,merkadoe,8,Fri Jun 19 12:34:30 2015 UTC,That was exactly my thought.  Guess I was tricked
breakingbad,3ae3a9,santaire,4,Fri Jun 19 12:52:14 2015 UTC,"yeah total cop out in my opinion. i was looking forward to connecting the dots to form a guess, but then in the last minute theyre like hey we never mentioned it but janes dad is an air traffic controller and all the shit revolving around walts house is completely insignificant to whats actually happening. season 2 as a whole is definitely a low point in an otherwise great show. not to say it didnt have great episodes, but the ending was a real let down."
breakingbad,3ae3a9,DabuSurvivor,4,Fri Jun 19 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"I love ABQ, personally. It would have been nice to have hints that he was an air traffic guy, but we did get hints of how it would end with 737 Down Over ABQ - and, if nothing else, you can't say that that season wasn't totally planned out (my biggest problem with season 5 is probably that it wasn't quite as planned out, which I think shows sometimes.) And Skyler walking out on Walt is for me one of the most satisfying moments in the series.  I dunno, I can get why some people don't love the plane crash but I totally love it. It's such a big, explosive moment and I love the cold opens building up to it. They do sort of play with our expectations - but on the other hand, if Flynn and Skyler died that early.. well first off, how would that happen in a way that the cold opens set up, but second, where would the story even go from there? Maybe the plane crash isn't something you can easily predict - but on the other hand, the ending that most people did expect really wouldn't have made much sense."
breakingbad,3ae3a9,dimplepinch,4,Sun Jun 21 07:01:00 2015 UTC,"Season 2 was ""the most planned out season we've ever done."" -Vince Gilligan  The plane crash was awesome and massively symbolic. Walt's actions cause a chain of events that leads to utter destruction--737 Down Over ABQ, the culmination of Walt's lies, the fracturing of his marriage, the Margolis connection, the teddy bear eye, and THE SINGLE BEST CG EFFECT EXPLOSION EVER SEEN OF TV UP UNTIL 2009. Ideas like the season 2 flashforwards should be rewarded and exalted for giving viewers objectively an exact image that leads us to expect a certain thing and yet gives us something unpredictable."
breakingbad,3ae3a9,DabuSurvivor,3,Fri Jun 19 17:58:32 2015 UTC,"Happy to see someone else appreciate it. ABQ is just below Ozymandias as far as my favorite episodes go, and Ozymandias is such an obligatory #1 that it doesn't even count. I love the plane crash. Everything comes together perfectly and truly explosively. It's such a bold way to end a season."
breakingbad,3ae3a9,dimplepinch,2,Sun Jun 21 07:02:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It is the most bold finale of the series. Even more so than Felina. Felina definitely had some mile markers to hit and expectations that simply had to be addressed. ABQ however set up the viewer for a certain expectation and then shattered it. It flies in the face of the standard, long form television narrative. It's the Sopranos finale effect. As a television audience we have been spoonfed comfortable tropes and have come to accept common worldviews and themes. So when a work of art doesn't meet these expectations or common themes we not only feel uncomfortable we feel justified in critiquing it."

breakingbad,3ae3a9,TYsir,4,Sun Jun 21 21:32:09 2015 UTC,Originally Jess was going to die in season 1 but the actors/characters chemistry was so good they kept him in.  it looked to me like the plane exploded right over walts house if I remember correctly he was in his back yard and watched it happen.
breakingbad,3ae3a9,Jagermeister4,6,Fri Jun 19 13:09:57 2015 UTC,"That whole plane crash thing was a bit of a misfire if you ask me. I thought the airplane crash was one of the weaker subplots of the series. All this build up for an event that had relatively little effect on the story. A lot of hype little payoff.   It should be the opposite, like in season 5 when they just show a little clip of Walt getting an assault rifle. Very little fanfare but it ends up having a big impact.   Still love the show of course."
breakingbad,3ae3a9,Jagermeister4,2,Fri Jun 19 17:30:41 2015 UTC,I think so too  Maybe the writer had other plans but go with this one instead.  Made me wanna know what the plans were.
breakingbad,3ae3a9,dimplepinch,2,Fri Jun 19 18:38:52 2015 UTC,Yep it seems like a lot of the times the writers would write something and not know how they would finish it. Vince Gilligan said they didn't know how they would use the assault rifle or Walt's ricin even after they already introduced it. They seemed to be really good at coming with things later except maybe no so much for this case.
breakingbad,3ae3a9,Jagermeister4,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:09:26 2015 UTC,"You honestly believe the flashforward of Walt getting the M60 had    Very little fanfare but it ends up having a big impact   This couldn't be more untrue. By this argument you're saying the season 2 flahsforwards had tons of 'fanfare', when the fact is Season 2 had incredibly low ratings and was at risk for cancelation while Season 5 is when everyone jumped on the bandwagon. Therefore the flashforward in 501 and 509 had an immense amount of fanfare and expectation."
breakingbad,3ae3a9,dimplepinch,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:49:19 2015 UTC,"huh? When I say fanfare it has nothing to do with ratings and the danger of cancellation. It has to do with # of scenes and the content of the teasers.  The teasers were in several episodes and stretched across the season, showed body bags, guys in hazmat suits, fire scorched items suggesting a fire at Walt's house, broken glasses similar to Walts, his car with a broken windshield.    With all this ""fanfare"" you'd expect a major event to happen that would dramatically change Walt's life. Instead all that occurs is a pretty useless subplot that barely affects Walt. The most memorable scenes created from the airplane crash is maybe Walt's cringy speech at the high school or Walt getting pulled over for his cracked windshield. The airplane crash was non factor to the story and to me was a disappointing storyline considering how much teasers we got over it.  Meanwhile the gun was introduced in only one scene. No scary images of guys in hazmats or anything like that, just a scene of Walt buying a gun. But it ended up being an integral part of the finale."
breakingbad,3ae3a9,Jagermeister4,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:57:21 2015 UTC,"you'd expect a major event to happen that would dramatically change Walt's life. Instead all that occurs is a pretty useless subplot that barely affects Walt.   So Skyler leaving him? The crumbling of his house of lies? The chain of events that he directly caused not only leads to a fracturing of his family, the ""whole reason"" he does this...but also the mass loss of innocent life. That seems interesting enough to me to justify the build up. But the build up is also the point--to have a conclusion that's unexpected and poignant.   Maybe this is just how we appreciate things differently. I like to be challenged by a flashforward. It's such a stylized, exaggerated artistic device at least how black and white is wholly independent from the show's look. I don't like to simply be presented events in advance. To me, that took a whole lot of punch out of the finale. It was still incredible and the best finale ever. But because I saw and was looking for what was coming it took a lot of the impact out of that finale shootout. I just imagine what the finale would have been like had we not known basically what was going to happen."
breakingbad,3ae3a9,dimplepinch,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:13:18 2015 UTC,"What does Skylar leaving him or his lies have to do with the airplane crash? Its unrelated.  There is a massive loss of life yes, but its not important to the story. If the plane crashed into their house causing the family to move to a different city or something, then yes it would be a major storyline. But in this case nothing actually changed. A show can take place in 2001 and reference that 9/11 just occured and how thousands of people died, but if nothing actually changes in the story then it doesn't matter how many people died, its a nonfactor to the story.  We'll have to disagree about the gun. I think if they did not introduce the gun and just had Walt spring the trap out of nowhere, it would have felt cheap. Walt magically kills all the bad guys with a contraption we did not know about. You have to foreshadow it somehow."
breakingbad,3ae3a9,AXVDF,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:29:22 2015 UTC,"Yes you have to foreshadow it. Just do it in a more subtle way. You don't have to flashforward to it at all...it gives away the excitement. We see the events transpire in the finale--we really didn't need to see it that far in advance. Again, it took away from the punch. I would have been happy seeing all the events of the finale without the flashforward to it.  You honestly think the plane crash meant nothing? It's symbolically linked to the narrative. It wasn't a coincidence that Walt caused the chain reaction, the culmination of his lies and the erosion of his family all just before the plane crash ""rains hellfire"" into the White pool of transformation.   That was my point. That a black and white flashforward is such a stylized literary device you shouldn't expect a simple depiction of events. The plane crash is a symbol. If you can't see how plainly it links to the story as a symbolic idea than you really are preventing your appreciation of Breaking Bad as the high art it is."

With kind of a ""how did I get here"" look on his face. And then the show so far, has been that thought. How did Saul get to that place?"

breakingbad,3a9adn,peroxwhyLUSH,-1,Thu Jun 18 20:10:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know, maybe it'll get written in?   And from my understanding, Saul didn't leave because of Walt. He underwent the identity change to avoid being arrested."
breakingbad,3a9adn,Zadeinator,2,Fri Jun 19 01:53:39 2015 UTC,"from his actions with Walt, wasn't it?"
breakingbad,3a9adn,peroxwhyLUSH,-1,Fri Jun 19 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah. But it was to avoid him being in jail because of Walt, maybe there's a loose end that isn't explained in all of this. I think at the time Walter and Jesse are introduced in BCS, it's going to show what Saul was doing when they were off camera.   I'm not expecting it, I'm saying it would be something cool.

breakingbad,3a67br,hitlerlovejuice,2,Thu Jun 18 04:52:53 2015 UTC,"Think of it like this, each season of The Wire focuses on a different element of the game. Season 1 is kind of the introduction. Season 2 shows you how the drugs come into the city (off the boats via crooked longshoremen). Season 3 focuses on local politics and infrastructure. Season 4 focuses on the kids/public schools. Season 5 is about the media.  Season 2 is known for being polarizing - people either love it or hate it. If you're having a hard time getting into S2 I'd say just power through it, once you hit S3 it's all downhill from there.  Honestly I didn't care much for S2 the first time I saw it. After watching the show through a few times I enjoy S2 a lot more, because you start to see how all the pieces fit together."
breakingbad,3a67br,di3sel,2,Thu Jun 18 05:34:03 2015 UTC,i had them in my drive so will definitely check them out. thanks for the short description.
breakingbad,3a67br,hitlerlovejuice,20,Thu Jun 18 05:37:00 2015 UTC,"Hit up the different HBO Series, such as True Detective, The Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood, Game of Thrones and so on.    I would also personally recommend FX's Justified, for a bit more fun and charming of a show, rather than edgy and gloomy.  This is more in the category of ""similar to these shows above"".  Personally in my top five favorite shows ever, and I have seen all of the aforementioned and then some.  It all depends on what you are specifically looking for."
breakingbad,3a67br,InvisibroBloodraven,10,Wed Jun 17 15:41:31 2015 UTC,i second justified.   very underrated show.
breakingbad,3a67br,schindlerslisp,2,Wed Jun 17 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"I just recently finished both Deadwood and Justified. Deadwood manages to fit in a ton of storylines in a very small 1870s camp in north Dakota. Justified is like a bastard child of Deadwood, doing the same but in modern day Kentucky.   Al Swearengen and Boyd Crowder are just fantastic villains/antagonists. And Olyphant is great in both series (I personally liked Raylan better than Deadwood's Seth).   So having just watched these, I'll recommend them first. Seriously, the dialogue in both (but especially Deadwood) is off the charts. Few shows can match the quality of it. Of course you can't go wrong with The Wire or Sopranos either.   Edit: personally I like Justified better as well, because it had a certain charm, and was at times extremely funny."
breakingbad,3a67br,Jabronius_Maximus,2,Thu Jun 18 01:56:51 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda digging the criminal side of things, Like Dexter, BB and so on. What is The Wire? Never actually heard of it."

breakingbad,3a67br,InvisibroBloodraven,4,Wed Jun 17 15:54:52 2015 UTC,"The Wire is actually regarded as the best television show ever.  Tons of characters and stories, but told beautifully with a great flow.  It was way ahead of its time, but anyone who has seen it could go on for days about its ""perfection"".  It will definitely give you more than you could ever hope for on the ""criminal side of things"".  Also, if you like the criminal stuff, Justified centers around a hero and an anti-hero, Timothy Olyphant and Walton Goggins, respectively.  The dialogue is on par or better than Deadwood and Breaking Bad.  The show has an Elmore Leonard feel to it (Jackie Brown/Get Shorty), since it is loosely based on his short stories.  This has a great balance of drama and comedy, and never takes itself too seriously.  I would put both of these miles ahead of Dexter, especially the former.  I would recommend trying to read a spoiler-free synopsis on these and go with what sounds appealing.  The Wire takes a while to get into the flow with all of the characters, but the payoff is totally worth it."
breakingbad,3a67br,Arrow156,3,Wed Jun 17 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"One thing about The Wire I feel I should warn new viewers: season 2 is the black sheep of the series.  People either love it or hate it, so if you are not digging it just power through them, it's worth it."
breakingbad,3a67br,InvisibroBloodraven,2,Wed Jun 17 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  I loved it because it was so different, but have had hours of discussions debating same.    I would say the same thing about Justified Season 1; just power through the procedural stuff.  Once they got approved for a second season, they hit with a main plot and nailed the show from then on.  By the way, your link below absolutely (hilariously) nails my thoughts.  Both shows are so great it is hard not to see things related to them or talk about them all of the time!"
breakingbad,3a67br,thisishardcore_,2,Wed Jun 17 16:04:29 2015 UTC,"Most people love S2, myself included, but it is very different to what people normally think of the show. It moves it's focus away from the drug dealing gangs in the ghettos. It's almost like a spinoff of The Wire.  I always felt like Hank was partially inspired by McNulty. Minus the alcoholism, sleeping around and decision to take out drug kingpins with actual backup.  But every character on the show is awesome. They all serve a purpose to the story, so there's no Walt Jr. or Marie types (with all due respect to them) and there's people in it who are similar to Walt and Gus."

breakingbad,3a67br,InvisibroBloodraven,0,Wed Jun 17 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"IMDB is user voted.  Not to mention, Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad have cult followings.  These also either just ended or are still in production.  The Wire has been over for seven years, and is .1 away from being tied with those shows.  You are splitting user-submitted hairs of followings that vote their stuff with 10s and their competition with 0s.  I have watched all of them as well, and personally find it impossible not to put that show squarely at the top.  IMBD is not the end all be all, and using that logic is laughable.  I mean, would you really try and tell someone The Dark Knight was the fourth best movie of all time?  No, unless you are trolling."

User-voted content is rife with manipulation, and are bolstered by large followings.  You taking a list like the one you linked, from one site, and using it to definitely state that The Wire is ""4th best."", is silly.  In fact, somewhere else on this thread I italicized that a certain show was one of my ""favorites"", knowing it is not one of the best.    I am not full of myself; I just have an understanding that IMDB ""Top Lists"" are not the end all be all definitive rankings of movies and tv shows."

That IMO is the best crime drama ever made. Very similar to breaking bad, about drugs, the police, addiction. But The Wire has a lot more characters and each season focuses on a different aspect of politics and crime. Whereas the Sopranos follows a Mob Boss who is an average guy, but kind of a borderline sociopath a lot like Walter White."

breakingbad,3a67br,kilobomb,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:54:08 2015 UTC,But Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul have probably trained you to be able to enjoy something like Mad Men   I'm not sure what you mean there... Granted I haven't seen MM but it seems to me it just has a lot less action (since that's not what it's about) and therefore is not really comparable to BB.
breakingbad,3a67br,Nights_King,2,Thu Jun 18 21:09:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but compare a show like BB to Dexter. BB clearly is a lot more character driven with the occasional slow burning moments. There are a lot more subtleties in everything, from the writing to set/costume design. Those are the kind of things that MM does so well too!"

breakingbad,3a67br,theatahhh,2,Wed Jun 17 20:23:57 2015 UTC,You should watch The Knick and Fargo.  Very good recently released TV Shows.
breakingbad,3a67br,cjfinn3r,2,Wed Jun 17 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"The Sopranos and The Wire are essential if you're a US TV drama junkie. All the big shows since owe a lot to these two, and especially Breaking Bad does, as Vince Gilligan himself has admitted.  Game Of Thrones as well, although this latest season has seen a drop in quality. Too many needless scenes, and it's kind of become a bit cheesy in a Hollywood way. But Seasons 1 to 4 are some of the best television I've seen.  Also, The Americans. And I'm not just saying this to the OP but to all of you who have been sleeping on this show. I'm not yet past the first season but it's been great so far. Has a very Breaking Bad/Sopranos feel to it, dealing with the theme of criminals juggling their civilian/family life with their illegal activities. Don't be surprised to see it explode in a few years time the way Breaking Bad did."

breakingbad,39zhta,Poerflip23,12,Tue Jun 16 08:28:25 2015 UTC,Vince Gilligan has indicated otherwise.
breakingbad,39zhta,joeloud,3,Tue Jun 16 08:33:52 2015 UTC,"It was recently confirmed by Vince, that Walter White will make an apperance. Vince has also said the show will take place during BrBa before. Also when Saul is kidnapped by Walt in BrBa he rats out Nacho to the cartel so that means the whole Nacho storyline doesn't finish until Saul meets Walt first."
breakingbad,39zhta,JonathanL72,4,Tue Jun 16 19:46:32 2015 UTC,"I thought he'd done this kind of thing a few times before too.  At this point, I'm just thinking he's doing viewer research, trying to work out what the best follow up to BB would be."
breakingbad,39zhta,thebluemonkey,3,Tue Jun 16 13:12:01 2015 UTC,I was in the midst of creating a post here when he said he was lying.
breakingbad,39zhta,Porsche924,2,Tue Jun 16 18:16:07 2015 UTC,Now we can never trust any rumors about him and breaking bad.
breakingbad,39zhta,V4refugee,2,Tue Jun 16 14:37:35 2015 UTC,This must be his form of revenge after Bryan Cranston told him that Jesse died whenever the actors got the new scripts.
breakingbad,39zhta,gellis12,2,Tue Jun 16 23:15:46 2015 UTC,I would check it out if Vince Gilligan was on board. Might be kind of a boring show if he's just hiding in Alaska the whole time though.

breakingbad,39zhta,cth1ic_warrior,-6,Wed Jun 17 00:36:26 2015 UTC,That show would've sucked though right?    It sounds like Aaron Paul might be missing all the attention he had been getting. Sad that he's having to lie about being relevant.

breakingbad,39zhta,V4refugee,3,Tue Jun 16 14:39:36 2015 UTC,"I think most of the cast apart aren't quite yet over Breaking Bad. I follow most of them on Twitter and nearly two years later they still tweet about the show.  Hard to blame them really, for better or worse most of them apart from Cranston and Odenkirk will always be remembered for being on Breaking Bad."
breakingbad,3a2k1y,dimplepinch,2,Tue Jun 16 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting thing to think about. I know it has been confirmed that color was used as a metaphor for moralistic depiction, but do you think they used this type of lighting throughout the series as well?"
breakingbad,3a2k1y,ImaginaryFri3nd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:24:55 2015 UTC,They do in very select moments. But it seems that most of the examples are found in 301-307.
breakingbad,3a2k1y,ImaginaryFri3nd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:34:17 2015 UTC,I wonder why that is...perhaps they were getting bored with the color thing so they wanted to play with other ways throughout the series.
breakingbad,3a2k1y,ImaginaryFri3nd,0,Tue Jun 16 20:36:22 2015 UTC,"They use multiple devices both plot and literary to symbolize or otherwise embody the dualistic theme that really is the whole crux of Breaking Bad. From Mr. Chips to Scarface, solution and dissolution, decay and transformation. Good and evil need not be expressed by only one avenue. Color, light, blocking, juxtaposition it all enhances the overall theme."

breakingbad,39t37g,CelticTalk,11,Sun Jun 14 20:08:35 2015 UTC,I started watching BB two weeks before Blood Money aired. I seen a news article stating the final season of breaking bad was about to start. So I thought it would be a good time to dive in.  I could not suffer with a year long wait.
breakingbad,39t37g,sublimei,7,Sun Jun 14 21:50:39 2015 UTC,"Watching the hype rise as everyone caught up with the series on Netflix was pretty cool. Waiting every year for Breaking Bad made it a part of my life. I grew with them.  No lie, after the toilet scene I was pissed as fuck for about a month and it would sporadically irk me throughout the year. Speculating in this subreddit and reading other's theories was part of the fun though. I'm enjoying the same process over at /r/betterCallSaul"

breakingbad,39t37g,BAXterBEDford,5,Mon Jun 15 13:39:12 2015 UTC,"Something like this happened to me!  I was watching through on my last job and was occasionally talking with a co-worker who had fully watched the series.  I was watching on netflix and the second half of the final season had not been posted yet.  So I finish with the Hank dump thinking:  ""Well I mean, it's not the worst ending ever.  It is interesting that they left it open ended but okay.  Atleast it's funny..."".  (I was trying to be optimistic).  The next day I go to work and am chatting with my buddy and we have a good 10 minute talk on the ending of the show.  We both conveniently talked very vaguely, saying things like: ""I thought the final scene was pretty good"".  Eventually I mention the dump and he starts laughing and informs me that I am not even close to the last episode.  Neither of us had realized the disconnect and I was super lucky that he somehow did not spoil anything."
breakingbad,39t37g,OldRowSwoodsy,7,Sun Jun 14 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"This is actually a great idea. If you watched all of the Season 5 episodes when they very first aired, you know that we had to wait an entire year for the final 8 episodes. A YEAR. Now granted, I knew that my burning questions would be answered the following year, but imagine if Hank finding out in the bathroom was really how the show ended and we didn't get an episode after that. I will forever be jealous of future Breaking Bad fans being that they have full access to every episode immediately"

Sure, it may not have the layers or depth or intricacy of something like The Wire, but it's still a highly entertaining show full of tension.  It took me ages to get into it as well. I really didn't enjoy the first two seasons because I found them slow and uneventful, and it took me until about halfway through the third season before I realised that it was a really good show.  To each their own though, and I'll agree that there's not many sympathetic characters on the show."

I really didn't enjoy the first two seasons because I found them slow and uneventful, and it took me until about halfway through the third season before I realised that it was a really good show.   The same thing happened to me. I just finished the whole series on Saturday, and I've got to say I regret not watching it earlier, but the first seasons were NOT what I was expecting. They did, however, built up this incredible world, these characters and plots that were fundamental to lead up to the amazing later half of the show. It is really a masterpiece of storytelling in my opinion. The writing is certainly top-notch, and the acting is amazing.   Coming from finishing The Wire a fortnight before, as you said, this is a different beast altogether. The greater focus on a handful of characters makes BB better from one point of view, but it isn't nearly as complex and truthful as TW was. Right now, though, both are my favorite shows of all time."

I don't know what to call him... a perfectionist, maybe?  Or a neat freak?  I think he's extremely observant of the world around him and likes things to perfect.  In cases like the mustard or the rot, I think his brain just latches onto distractions to help him cope.  The mustard is his cancer diagnosis, and the rot is him avoiding his family troubles.    I don't think there's a need to wrap up his tendencies in a one size fits all manor, he keeps himself occupied when he's stressed.  I don't think it's necessarily representative of something deeper.  It's more like his perfectionist tendencies manifest more when he has something to worry over.  He likes fixing things, so when he can't fix something huge like his family or his relationship with Gus, he finds something else to worry about that he can fix."
breakingbad,39mpo7,bothanspy1337,47,Fri Jun 12 23:09:51 2015 UTC,"As far as the mustard goes, I thought it was more that Walt didn't want a doctor delivering him a death sentence to be tainted by a stain.

breakingbad,39mpo7,black_angus1,10,Fri Jun 12 23:34:26 2015 UTC,"TL;DR this (kind of)  Although I understand why people would call this ""OCD Behavior"", it's not how it works.  Being obsessed with cleaning is a meticulous want for perfection, having OCD-like tendencies is having a overwhelming compulsive drive to NEED to do something in a ritualized, scripted or seemingly arbitrary fashion.  I'll use some of my past experiences as an example below.  I should probably mention first that I've never been diagnosed with it officially, by the way, I've just noticed certain obsessive behaviours in my past that have been treated with medication.  I don't know if this ""counts"" or not.  My house is not spotless.  At all.  Hell, my house is not even clean.  I've got laundry that was literally just cleaned laying on the floor because I was too lazy to put it away.  I haven't vacuumed in months and sometimes I'll re-wear the same clothes multiple days in a row if I'm feeling especially lazy.  I can go days without brushing my teeth.  What I am saying is that I am not a hyper-clean neat freak.  So why would I identify with those behaviors?  Well, let's take a look at the ritual I would have to go through for leaving the house (this is going many years back, prior to meds entering the picture):  Open my bedroom door, close my bedroom door, open my bedroom door, close my bedroom door, slam it shut.  Check the crack along the side of the door to ensure that it is properly closed, try and turn the knob counter-clockwise on it twice.  Grab my bookbag, put it on my right shoulder, take it off, put it on my left shoulder, take it off, put it on my right then my left shoulder.  Readjust the straps as tight as they will go, readjust as loose as they will go, readjust so they are exactly where they were when I first put them on.  It can take five minutes to get this part right.  Go to the kitchen, open the fridge door, close the fridge door, open the fridge door, close the fridge door, open the fridge door, close the fridge door, check the grot along the outside of the fridge door while pressing it shut tightly with the handle to ensure cold air isn't escaping.  Wipe the palm of my hand along the handle of the door, wipe the back of my hand along the handle of the door, wipe the palm of my hand along the handle of the door, wipe the back of my hand along the handle of the door, wipe the palm of my hand along the handle of the door, wipe the back of my hand along the handle of the door, wipe the palm of my hand along the handle of the door, wipe the back of my hand along the handle of the door, check the grot again to ensure cold air isn't escaping.  If I touched the freezer door handle accidentally while doing this, there are additional steps that need to be followed.  Go to the back door and slide the lock off, open the door, close the door, open the door, close the door, slide the chain lock shut, pull on the door three times to test the chain, slide the chain off the door, slide the chain on the door, test the chain twice in quick succession, lock the handle to the door, unlock the handle to the door, lock the handle to the door, unlock the handle to the door, try and turn the handle clockwise HARD, unlock the handle to the door, lock the handle to the door, try and turn the handle counter-clockwise.  Go to the front door (still inside the house), lock and unlock the deadbolt three times, lock and unlock the door handle five times.  Go outside the front door, close it, open the front door, close it, open it and SLAM it shut with one hand while turning to face in the opposite direction.  Lock the deadbolt and try and press hard on the door, turn the handle clockwise twice, lock the handle to the front door, push on the front door twice with your right hand, lean into the door with your whole body to make sure it's shut, try and turn the handle to the front door counter-clockwise and clockwise twice.  Leave.  If the rhythm is messed up at any point, I'm interrupted or feel like I didn't do it ""right"" for some reason, start over.  If I don't remember if I did something, start over and do it twice.  Hope you didn't forget anything inside or else you're going to have to do it three times!  I managed to wean myself out of doing this over the course of several years, but after it got down to just like ""check the door and lock it"" I would be sitting at work and feel like I left ever light, faucet and the oven on for hours at a time, every single time I left the house.  Medication curbed that feeling later on.  The only thing that really motivated me to stop doing it was that I was starting to find myself late for appointments because I wasn't setting aside enough time to do this ritual.  I actually left out a big chunk about faucets, checking for water, smells, etc. because I know there's a character limit for comments.  Aside from that, there was also the fact that certain parts would either drop off or be added on seemingly at random depending on how anxious I felt at the time.  Medicine is awesome though, so...yeah.  Anyway, my whole point was basically just to say that using OCD that way is just technically incorrect.  It's like being one of those people that says something like ""I'm totes bipolar...yeah, this one time, I was like...happy, right?  Then later, I was totally sad.  It was like 'Whoa!'  For no reason!""  Walt might have been a bit obsessive in his cleaning, but it could have simply been because he did not feel like he had control over some of the things that were going on in his life (cancer, being fired, getting mixed up with drugs, murder, etc.)  It's not even really that I'm the type of person to get offended by this type of thing (I'm not offended, by any means by the way)....honestly, I'm just glad that the general public is aware that anxiety disorders exist at this point and they vaguely know the jist of one or two of them!  The whole OCD = obsessive cleaning thing is just a silly stereotype though.  I wouldn't be surprised if it does manifest itself that way in some people, but I doubt it's the case for the vast majority.  The only time I ever get annoyed by it is when people start to say stuff like they ""wish"" they had OCD so they could clean up their deskspace or some shit, but even then it's just talking from a place of ignorance, not disrespect."
breakingbad,39mpo7,Fishare,2,Sat Jun 13 04:43:54 2015 UTC,Do you mind me asking what kind of medication you take? I know antidepressants are common but not the only course of treatment.  That's a bit off topic though. Very well written comment-I liked being able to get an idea of your thought process.
breakingbad,39mpo7,JeffroTheMan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:25:22 2015 UTC,"Sure! Like I said, I managed to overcome most of it without drug assistance, the drugs helped a lot with the feelings of not doing it created. Also being able to feel confident enough to learn to drive was a huge part too.  I started off with 10mg of Lexapro but it made me nauseous so they switched me to 20mg Prozac, then 40mg. I've also got a PRQ(?) dosage of .5mg of Xanax for overwhelming moments.  I'm Agoraphobic, so being in crowds can be a problem at times.  It's been lessened significantly by Prozac.  Xanax kind of turns me into a zombie, can be addictive and can cause medical problems when used in combination with Prozac, so I only use it in emergencies.  Also it's classified as a controlled substance so if I were stopped and drug tested while on, it I could get into legal trouble.  For the longest time I was against medication of any kind because I felt like it would be ""cheating"" and because of certain family issues I was always concerned about getting a dependency on meds if I were to starte. The thing that really pushed me over the edge into trying was this video (several times a day for a month): https://youtu.be/78IiD4ogl5M"

Walt's struggle is for 100%, even though he's only capable of 99.1. It's those things that are beyond his control that always cause him trouble- Skyler's suspicion and finally revolt upon being clued in, Tuco's cousins travelling hundreds of miles just to kill him even after Tuco is 'resolved' in Walt's mind, and Jack's crew coming to Tohajilee despite being called off."

In this link http://i.imgur.com/atS0KTe.png you'll see GALe spelled out on the outside of Lydia's office in 504.   But Gale/Lydia as the loose thread concept was further reinforced in Season 5A. In 508 while Walt sits with Lydia at the coffee shop with the ricin under his hat he asks ""Am I not tying up loose ends for our mutual benefit?"" Then in 504 Mike and Jesse are arguing over whether or not to kill Lydia. Jesse says ""I vote this is a voting thing. Mr. White you wanna weigh in here..."" cut to Walt fingering the loose thread. ""Nothing stops this train..."" At the end of 504 Walt (having been described as a 'timebomb' by Mike in 502) tells Skyler that Jesse was going to shoot him in the head but ""he changed his mind about me and so will you."" Walt then retires to bed and places his watch on the table and we zoom in to an extreme close up of the ticking watch.

breakingbad,39ky0c,MrBoobieBuyer,5,Fri Jun 12 16:47:36 2015 UTC,"Yea see this is the second biggest issue I have with this sub. And sorry this is long but I've been waiting to say this since I joined this sub. Spoilers ahead.  Think about that scene in Fifty-one where Walt goes to bed and the camera focuses in on the clock counting down time. Think about that scene for a second. What did it mean?  What is foreshadowing? So it's a literary device where the author hints what is to come (wikipedia).  But in Breaking Bad, Vince Gilligan has stated multiple times, he didn't know how the story would end. He and the writing staff while writing the last season, talked about every conceivable ending they could think of. They allowed everyone to contribute ideas no matter how far fetched or ridiculous. Some where he lives, some where he dies.  What's important to understand is that in television, they don't write out every scene of every episode beforehand. Episode 1 is being filmed while episode 5 is being written. So as an example, Walt is seen in 5a, with a beard, New Hampshire license plates, and a huge gun in his truck. It has been stated clear and without misunderstanding they wrote that scene without anyone at all knowing how Walt ended up there. The simply wrote a cool scene and said ""we'll figure out out later."" They've done this before where Walt and Jessie are in the RV and Hank is closing in on them. They knew they wanted everyone together like that, and forced themselves to find a solution after they've written themselves into a corner, deliberately.  So since the ending of the entire show wasn't figured out until sometime between season 5a and 5b, it's not foreshadowing, right?   Well we have to address authorial intent. What this means is, it's possible for the viewer to interpret a scene ""correctly"" without the author intending it to be viewed that way. Vince Gilligan started rooting for Walt from the beginning, but at a certain point in the show finally came to where he no longer could root for Walt in good conscious. If you have a change of heart before or after he had that realization, is your interpretation wrong? Who's to say the artist has to tell you how to feel? Just like a painting, it's creation is supposed to illicit a reaction in you. Art is not always passive where you sit back and someone tells you have to feel. Your experience shapes the meanings you have about a given work. So maybe you thought Walt deserved to die at the end. Maybe I didn't. What does it matter what Vince thought?  Same with his announcement of death in the beginning of the show. Does the author HAVE to know the ending for this to be called foreshadowing? When you look back afterwards it's easy to say that, but can we still call it foreshadowing if Vince never knew if Walt would die? That's a gray area.  Finally, there are many people involved in this work. Remember the ending scene in Fifty-one, where Walt goes to bed and the camera focuses in on the time on the watch ticking? That was a decision by director Rian Johnson. Vince did not write it. When Vince asked Rian what it means, he answers that basically he thought it was cool. Meanwhile this sub goes up in arms about it foreshadowing Walt being a ticking-time bomb, or that his time is running out. That was never intended, so who's right or wrong?  But if you ask me, Walt being diagnosed with cancer is not foreshadowing. Why? Well it's not a ""hint"" about the future. It's relevant information that is necessary for the motivation of Walter White. Foreshadowing are hints. This wasn't tucked into their background of a scene, or a subtle double-meaning quote from a character. This was the entire reason the show exists and is presented directly to us. It's not a hint.  But not every single shot or color has a double meaning...But that's another rant I can have with this sub that would be twice as long as this."

Sure you know the plot, but you can experience it in a new way.   Same with a TV show. You may know the fates of a few characters, but half the fun is in how they get there."
breakingbad,39ky0c,champ1258,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:54:27 2015 UTC,I still say watch it but it definitely won't be the same knowing who dies and all that. The only positive is that you don't know when they die at least.
breakingbad,39ky0c,puppyhugz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:55:48 2015 UTC,A definite Hell Yes! The character transformation is fantastic. The deeper you go into the minds of the characters and how you see them coping with what's inevitably going on is worth watching. Plus it has its few moments when it can deliver a good laugh to break up the constant drama side to the whole story. Well worth a watch. As a matter of fact I need to re watch it to try and catch the subtleties I might have missed the first go through. Plus once Saul is introduced ( Bob Odenkirk ) plays a great comic relief.

I started watching with my friends while I was at their apartment and the first episode I saw was one or two before the finale where shit went down. I was confused as hell so a few months later I started from the beginning.

I went to film school; I couldn't avoid spoilers if I tried because all of my classmates were OBSESSED and rightfully so.   First off, the story is great. Nothing ever feels forced and it's always interesting. Sometimes it's exciting because of the action; other times it's exciting because of interactions between these characters that you actually care about. And the character development is amazing. I have SO many thoughts on character development alone. And you don't just grow to care about Walt & Jesse; you even care about the supporting cast. (Side note: Watch Breaking Bad and then watch Better Call Saul. Better Call Saul is also great.)  It is shot really well. I really dig the cinematography. The show utilizes color incredibly well, but there are also some amazingly beautiful shots and time-lapses. I have watched a lot of TV... like, a lot. And I genuinely feel like Breaking Bad is easily one of the best shows ever. I know, I know. Every Breaking Bad fan says that, but trust me on this one."
breakingbad,39ky0c,sweetthang1972,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:40:26 2015 UTC,I have watched it twice.  Will watch again.  So obviously it wasn't spoiled for me by my knowledge of it.

You'll dislike Jane the enabler even moreso and respect Mike WAY more.  Mike suddenly becomes the mentor character rather than Walt on your first watch."

The suspense isn't about his certain death, it's about how he is going to care for his family after his certain death. Every time he seems to get ahead, there is a setback. It is this race to the finish that is the basis for the entire story.  Also some of the best writing and acting of any TV show ever.  So yes, definitely worth watching."
breakingbad,39ky0c,Snape_Girl,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed! It is still worth watching. Although you may know who and what happens, the mystery lies in the where, when and how(hopefully). The cinematography is excellent as well as the actors/actress' themselves."

breakingbad,39ky0c,achtung82,-2,Mon Jun 15 06:06:06 2015 UTC,The ending was very predictable and hardly what makes BB the fantastic series it is. But do try and stay away from spoilers from now on now that you start watching it. Its always better the less you know.

I don't love, hate or care about a single character on this show.""  Dumped the rest from my queue and moved on with my life.   Proceed with the downvotes."

breakingbad,39o1rl,therealbonkoly,3,Sat Jun 13 03:33:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think he ever stopped cooking for his family. Yes, there was a point that that was no longer his only reason. But when he told Skyler that he did it for himself, I think that was not so much an admission as it was him telling her what she wanted to hear.  That said, I agree with you. He knew his cancer was in remission. The reason he started cooking in the first place was essentially gone. He didn't need to do it anymore but he didn't stop."
breakingbad,39o1rl,DabuSurvivor,2,Sat Jun 13 03:45:44 2015 UTC,Oh wow I can believe I didn't think of that. I took his words to mean he did it for himself ONLY. I never thought of him having 2 motives before
breakingbad,39o1rl,8144639,2,Sat Jun 13 03:48:12 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think he ever started cooking for his family. If he were just acting for his family, he'd have taken Gretchen and Elliot's money, but he wanted a choice, wanted to be awake and feel alive, etc. I believe he believed he was doing it for his family, but I don't think he was. And I certainly don't think you could say he was still doing it for his family at the time of, say, Buyout, when he turns down far more money than he or his family could ever need because he'd rather thrive ""in the empire business."""
breakingbad,39o1rl,dimplepinch,2,Tue Jun 16 08:41:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. He didn't take their money because he didn't want to hurt his pride, it would make him feel inferior. His concerns were more important than his family's concerns."

breakingbad,39o1rl,DabuSurvivor,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:37:40 2015 UTC,I considered that and other things over the few days I took to recuperate and my main counter argument was that in the first few seasons he made it a point to do the math with the bills and his meth earnings to see how much more he meeded.
breakingbad,39o1rl,DabuSurvivor,2,Sat Jun 13 03:46:10 2015 UTC,Well of course he was. Walt doesn't want to admit to himself that he's making meth for himself. He's living in denial. He's only doing the math in an attempt to convince himself that he will stop.
breakingbad,39m6mi,OnusDefacto,3,Fri Jun 12 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"Briefly. It's exactly the same as the original, with different actors and settings."
breakingbad,39m6mi,1wiseguy,0,Fri Jun 12 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see that from just the first few episodes, but I guess the fact that it takes place in Colombia I wonder where Gus will be from, how the beef with the cartel will play out, what will happen when they Go national, and what will happen when they go International.   I don't know, but I guess after watching the origional around 3 or 4 times I like those little differences.  It's like picking out Easter Eggs.   I'm going to keep watching it.  Ninja Edit: Also hearing them talk about how he cooks the meth in crystal form, just like ""Los Gringos"" is hilarious.  Gringo Edit: Also the fact that I was going to watch it again between seasons of Saul make it worthwhile, because I still want to rethink the plot, but seeing new actors and stuff keeps it fresh.   It's like seeing a high production play with different troupes.   But if subtitles bother you then I could see it being a pain."
breakingbad,39m6mi,1wiseguy,2,Sat Jun 13 00:04:04 2015 UTC,"I stumbled onto a couple episodes on TV. It was interesting that the script was literally the same, down to the finest detail. It must have cost about $5 to write the script, because it's pretty much just a translation, with the character names changed.  I know they changed some of the background stuff to accommodate the different culture, but the dialog seems unchanged."

It takes time to come down from it, but you will in time. Better Call Saul is pretty great. It's much lighter and has some brilliant acting. It also serves to keep the connection with BB so you don't have to go completely cold turkey."

I couldn't watch a drama show for a solid 3 months because they all felt so sub par to Breaking Bad.  I just couldn't deal with their ""low quality.""  Luckily, you do get over it.  It will take a while (probably less time for you as you have only been involved in the BB universe for only a few weeks, whereas I have been in it for a solid 3 years), but you will start to learn to appreciate other shows again.  I'm actually rewatching the whole series (I just finished season 2 today).  It's awesome because I don't remember so many little details, so it's as if I'm seeing a lot of it for the first time again.   My advice is to watch non-drama shows for a while.  I caught up on Always Sunny in Philadelphia as well as Veep during those 3 months.  Once you're back on the drama kick, I recommend Mad Men.  While it's a lot slower and a completely different type of show, the character development is excellent, which is why I loved BB so much."

She gets SO much better in season 4 though. Skyler is actually one of my favourite characters now."

I mean hell, we see what happens where she doesn't (Walt getting kidnapped by Tuco, having the house vetted by the cousins, etc), so we KNOW her fears are valid.

He simply couldn't even imagine that his geeky book-smart brother-in-law would be capable of being Heisenberg. To him it was just as probable as the claim that it's possible to cross the speed of light. In retrospect I'm sure he struck himself for his head like ""The clues were glaring me in the face! WHY DIDN'T I SEE!"" but at the time, he had no idea.

Hank went in to Walt's house to take a dump and looked in Walt's basket of books to read and picks up the copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass that Gale Boetticher gave Walt when they began working together.  Hank opened the book to the inside where ""To my other favorite W.W.  It's an honor working with you. Fondly G.B."" is written in Gale's handwriting.  Immediately, Hank puts the pieces together and leaves with Marie and goes home.  From there you are going to need to watch the rest of the show.  Hope this answers your question.

Walter keeps putting himself out there for jessies sake. he is almost a polar opposite of flynn (they never share a scene). What do you think about the ending, how they wrapped it u? What woyld you have wanted to go different in the last episode?"
breakingbad,39ezrb,not-a-prince,3,Thu Jun 11 08:51:59 2015 UTC,"Walter's character was unusually criminally/chemically brilliant, while being some what of a bumbling fool in most other regards. It was strange.  Anyways, i dont think i could have done anything possibly better or more perfectly than walter could have. Nor more ethical.  I would have stopped and left jessie, assuming i didn't know he was a slave. Hell, i'd probably still leave him there if i knew. I'd probably retreat back into the darkness and try to rebuild this ""meth empire"".  But I guess without that well connected lawyer, Saul, Walter is nothing."
breakingbad,39ezrb,jack_goldie,3,Thu Jun 11 09:03:10 2015 UTC,"To your bumbling fool point, I felt that that became less and less over the series as he figured out how to be a criminal.  If you look at the show as a whole, Walter slowly goes from a guy who is actually out there for his family to a true criminal.  However, I think that there is still at least a shred of good in Walt until the end.  For example, and this is one of my favorite scenes in BB, he had no true intention of having Gary and Gretchen killed, so instead he only played mind games with them by having Badger and Skinny Pete shine laser pointers through the window, which, as you mentioned, seemed to be one of his strong suits.  Walter is a complex character and I think it takes a lot to understand him."
breakingbad,39ezrb,insky,8,Thu Jun 11 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"Actually he really deeply rooted for Jessie in the way W.W. was capable of loving and caring for others than himself. As Walter's process from Mr Chips to Scarface (as the producer puts it) endures many seasons, also his relationship to Jessie changes and evolves over time. At first Jessie is just the guy who introduces him to the world of drugs. Then they experience everything together, brilliant cooks and awful murders. Jessie was the one who always looked up to Walt for him being the smart guy. Walter feels (or is) underestimated by most of people his whole life. When with Jessie he's the one in charge, he's the one who says how they cook and what they shall do in general compared to his other relationships: Skyler decides everything in the first 2 seasons, Hank is the male Alpha of the family even Flynn likes him more than Walt. When working with Gale, who is a true chemist and as inspired by chemnistry as Walter himself he knows that he cannot work with him. Even though Gale doesn't disrespect Walter for his cruel working attitude Walter feels challanged in his position of being the brilliant one. Also, he knew Jessie would be loyal or the one who can be more manipulted. Obviously Walter takes advantage of Jessie's loyalty and plays with him as if he would own him. Walter at one point does that to all the ones he cares about. In season 5 when Walter and Mike seem like the two father figures who work with Jessie it feels like Walter also killed Mike for being jaleous about Jessie caring so much for Mike. The end of the season makes it seem like all Walter and Jessie had is gone and ruined by what Walter did. But then we get the epic serie's finale and Walter's last try to make a decent goodbye and give Jessie the happy life he deserves. DAMN I miss this show!"
breakingbad,39ezrb,akambe,6,Thu Jun 11 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"It always gets me when viewers voice their support for Walter because he was doing it ""for his family."" From square one, he was making a drug that ruins people's lives. He's a great character, and it's a great dramatic series, but Walter White was just a despicable, manipulative, selfish human being."
breakingbad,39ezrb,akambe,2,Thu Jun 11 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with you so strongly if i had not saw the last episode. ""Walter is the good guy. He's just filling a void that would otherwise be filled! You can't question a man providing for his children!""  Damn, i am so dumb.

Beyond that, I recommend reading some of the many fan-written essays as a means of gaining more insight into the characters and that which drives them."

I personally considered this scene has a crucial importance by the end of season 4. It's in the line of the fine crafting of the script.  I'll explain myself: by the end, when there was the explosion, from which we all see Gus walking out of, we all presumed that he was dead... but.. you can't be completely sure... maybe he could be saved.. maybe not..he wasn't in pieces, was he?. He walked out...remember? And then, I think it is when Walt is in his rented car, he hears in the Radio that in the explosion 3 people died... but..they don't say who. Just ""3 people"", and that 90-y-old weak lady lived on the room beside the one where Hector was kept. The one with the Huge Blast. She could have easly been one of the dead, sparing Gus.  That lady was not only a joke, I believe it was the scripters option to keep Gus alive on the fifth season.  [sigh]...Breaking Bar,... pure Gold."

breakingbad,39cg15,TWilson87,11,Wed Jun 10 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"I think Todd is the only downright sociopath in Breaking Bad. (I would also say Gus, if not for the flashback where his partner got shot dead) I mean, yeah, he has some sort of a 'crush' on Lydia, but it's almost childish. Like he doesn't really know what it means. He speaks of people at BEST as in ""respect"" (we know he deeply respects both Walter and his uncle. But does he really CARE for them? No. He'd just as easily put a bullet through their brains if it would benefit him). He is the type of guy that shoots an innocent single mom and then says ""It had to be done"" or shoots a kid without even blinking and says ""I saw no other way""  Now, that is sociopathy to me.   Walt, on the other end, is totally NOT a sociopath. It is clear in both the beginning and the far end that he is capable of expressing and experiencing ALL emotions in the human spectrum. Eventually killing comes pretty easy to him, and he starts to regard as other human beings (aside his family, and Jesse, in some way) as chess pieces to be played, yes. But for him that was something he had to 'learn'. He had to construct ways for him to bypass his empathy, to say to himself each time that he was doing the right thing, that he had no other choice, etc. Whereas a true sociopath wouldn't need to do such a thing. He would have no empathy in need of bypassing."
breakingbad,39cg15,ErikEzrin,3,Wed Jun 10 21:16:03 2015 UTC,Walt is just a textbook narcissist.
breakingbad,39cg15,clearmood,3,Fri Jun 12 01:00:47 2015 UTC,"He is that way because he feels like everyone is set out to hurt or wrong him in some way, for his entire life.  That's what happens if you keep your feelings of frustration to boil in your insides, and then consecutively aren't honest to yourself about the true reasons of your anger. Then you fail to see that only a small part of that anger towards the other people is fair, and the rest is caused because you decided to keep the lid on that bubbling brew for too long.  If you feel that way... everything becomes one, big ""payback"".  He just thinks he DESERVED that revenge, no matter the cost, because feels like he has been wronged to the infinite in the past, and now thus is entitled to rub it all back into everyones faces."
breakingbad,39cg15,ErikEzrin,2,Fri Jun 12 07:30:57 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that he put so much time and effort into avenging his friend is another sign that Gus probably isn't a sociopath. That makes him more interesting in a way though, because now I'd like to know how the hell he managed to end up the way he did."

breakingbad,39cg15,ErikEzrin,3,Sun Jun 14 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"Sociopathy/psychopathy are very... unclear terms. I'm no psychologist but from what experience I've had regarding mental health, there doesn't seem to be definite definitions that everyone agrees on.   One idea I saw floating around was that they have the ability to feel love/empathy, but they have a sort of mental switch. They can control what they feel and for whom, essentially reaping all the benefits of social emotions with little downsides. However I haven't seen much more of this idea so maybe it was thrown out as trash.  But yeah, there is debate regarding what is and isn't socio/psychopathy, but I definitely don't think that feeling love for someone else erases the possibility."

He joined the business under the guise of helping his family, when in reality he was looking for a thrill and to feel important.

However, with the whole Gretchen ordeal, he did not want to be  under her money and ""in debt"" to her for his accomplishments. When that was revealed that he left the company, I think it was showing his rebellion to any form of subordination. But being a teacher, under the school system, under his wife, etc. he was trapped. When he started cooking meth, it was control but not enough. Therefor he went up the ladder of dealers until he met Gus who was the top. Finally he realized he had to be the controller since he was power hungry, leading to his demise. He is the beginning and end of his own life since he couldn't deal with taking orders from anyone."

breakingbad,396rdb,r_mizrach,4,Tue Jun 9 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"I watched the highlights, and enjoyed the hell out of it for the novelty factor - the one-star rating is probably due to freaked out fanboys. Some of the acting is actually very good (I think Cielo is better than Skyler, especially in dramatic scenes; also loved Saul even though I adore Odenkirk). I also kind of loved their take on Gus; his actor is so unassuming looking, almost dad-like, making it even creepier as he slits throats with box cutters and the like. It definitely feels like a telenovela with the odd placement of dramatic music and the lower-budget film, but it's very interesting."
breakingbad,396rdb,ackchanticleer,2,Wed Jun 10 02:06:38 2015 UTC,It's not necessarily bad. It just takes some getting used to. And needless to say its obviously not nearly as good as Breaking Bad

breakingbad,392w4w,Computerology,5,Mon Jun 8 23:57:01 2015 UTC,"I've always found it particularly fascinating what a litmus test Breaking Bad is - it reveals huge amounts about its viewers when they react to it. The viewers who cling to Walter the Hero as he descends to villainy, the Skylar haters, the reactions to Jane - these tell us as much about the viewer's expectations as the characters, more even, since the characters are fictional and the reactions real. The fact that the show plays as much with genre as plot is in part responsible for this, and I always suspected Walter was an experiment in seeing how far you can stretch the audience's sympathy with a figure once established (answer: pretty damn far)"
breakingbad,392w4w,flightlessbird,6,Sat Jun 13 20:16:37 2015 UTC,Not sure If I agree with everything here but an interesting point of view nonetheless

breakingbad,392w4w,Kattastrophe,5,Thu Jun 11 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's really difficult to say if a character like Skylar is a misogynistic representation of female characters. It's easy to let your own sexism color your opinion of her.   I found her to be bitchy, mostly unlikable, and very complex. And I think his definition of Jane as a MPDG, then femme fatale is a gross oversimplification of her character. It's like he saw her, decided that's what she was, and made her for into the box, until she didn't, which meant that her character was purely written, not that he was wrong."

breakingbad,38xaus,HermyKermy,79,Sun Jun 7 17:09:24 2015 UTC,"At this point when I was watching, I didn't like Walt anymore either. Hated him, actually. He's an amazing character and very well written but he's quite the opposite of likeable. And to be fair, I'm pretty sure that's what the writers intended. Walt's actions are supposed to make you like him less and less until he's a full-fledged villain around the end of season 4/beginning of season 5."
breakingbad,38xaus,quinnly,37,Sun Jun 7 17:43:27 2015 UTC,Seconded that this was the writers' intention.  I lost all sympathy for Walt well before the end of s4 - and I'm not talking about a rewatch.  It still amazes me that so many root for him til the end.
breakingbad,38xaus,LibraryKrystal,16,Sun Jun 7 18:20:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, it was way back in S2 when he watched Jane choke to death instead of helping her so he could continue to manipulate Jesse into helping him make money. He did LOTS of fucked up shit that made him unmistakably a villain. The reason we rooted for Walt was because it made us confront the truth that even villains are still humans, they're not just big balls of evil, and when you're forced to get to know one, you can understand why they do the things they do. If it was a show about the DEA, Walt could have been the story's main antagonist without changing a single detail."
breakingbad,38xaus,prezuiwf,10,Sun Jun 7 20:31:50 2015 UTC,Remember in the very beginning Walt threatened Jesse with busting him to the cops if he didn't help him cook.  He was a manipulative a**hole from the start.
breakingbad,38xaus,PHDTPHD,12,Sun Jun 7 21:54:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that clear cut. Remember that Jane was blackmailing Walt, pretty severely, and threatening to effectively end his life. She was also getting Jesse hooked on heroin. She was hardly an innocent party."
breakingbad,38xaus,zarx,19,Sun Jun 7 22:31:49 2015 UTC,"Although I clearly saw he'd gone over the edge after the season 4 finale, I was still pulling for him and liked him right up until what he did to Mike and his men and then the final bits of support left after what he did to Jesse in Ozymandias.   Mainly because despite the fact it had clearly become a power trip for him by that point, he'd still do everything in his power to defend his family and Jesse, even if it involved his twisted logic. He wasn't abusing his power, he was doing bad things to defend the ones he loved, even the poisoning of Brock was via Walt's twisted logic protecting Jesse along with his family, no one should doubt that Jesse would have been killed by Gus sooner or later given the history there. You could still see the remaining elements of the man from season 1 and I hoped that he'd step back from the precipice, however the final showdown with Mike, his disposal of Mike's men and his refusal to stop cooking even when he had more than secured his family's future were when I lost him. What he then did to Jesse (even in a fit of anger and later partly rectified) was the final nail in the coffin, where he went beyond any hope of redemption, even at the same time as his desperate attempts to save Hank showed there was still some good left in him."
breakingbad,38xaus,Magneto88,8,Sun Jun 7 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, I feel the last half of the final season was the ghost of the man who set this in motion trying to set it right, but he was more monster than man right after Ozymandias."
breakingbad,38xaus,DocGonzo13,0,Sun Jun 7 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"I'm always hearing that Mike's death was the point of no return for most people for when they stopped liking Walt completely, but it didn't really affect me that much. There were times before where Mike had held Walt at gun point with the intention to kill and the only thing that stopped him was Walt's clever way of turning the tables. I do like Mike's character and was sad when he died, but I felt like it was kind of fair."
breakingbad,38xaus,Tino42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:02:45 2015 UTC,"There was a difference though. Mike never killed anyone who wasn't a direct threat. He also never lashed out. Walt murdered Mike - murdered him! - because he got a little pissed off and his pride was hurt. That was it. He knew he could get the list off of Lydia, and he knew Mike would never have given it to him anyway, and nobody would know Mike was alive after he got shipped off. He wasn't thinking when he killed Mike, he was just nursing his ego."

breakingbad,38xaus,Deviant_Fart,-1,Sun Jun 7 22:12:56 2015 UTC,"I find that most of the characters on the show are no longer likable by the end of s4.  Skylar is a bitch, Hank thinks Walt is a total loser and so he doesn't entirely respect him, Marie is a kleptomaniac that is super annoying, Jesse is a druggie that has periodic emotional breakdowns, and, as we talked about, Walt is a full on criminal at this point, writer's intent or not.  I found that without rooting for someone in the show it is hard to want to keep going with it.  While the writing is brilliant and the actors play their roles wonderfully, if you don't have an investment in one of the characters it is like mindlessly sitting and doing nothing.  I think that under the villain in Walt, there are some fibers of good in his core that compel him to kill Gus instead of skipping town and just leaving his family and Jesse to die, which is the reason that I didn't give up on Walt entirely."

breakingbad,38xaus,yoyo9797,23,Mon Jun 8 09:11:54 2015 UTC,"Remember, Gus was pretty good with a boxcutter, and it was implied somewhere that he was involved with Pinochet's torture regime. And he did threaten to kill walt's wife, son, and infant doda  Also you forgot s3 ... ""no half measures"" was all about Gus having decided that Jesse had to be killed. He failed to pull it off only because Walt saw thru his ploy and rescued Jesse at the last moment. Yes, Gus' ploy was to get the dealers to kill Tomas (after the meeting with Jesse when he said ""no more kids"" .. he falsely led Jesse to believe kids would no longer be used). Instead, he had Tomas killed just to infuriate Jesse into making a stupid mistake seeking revenge. That way Walt would understand that it was Jesse who committed suicide, and not Gus who killed him.  Walt put Gus' nose out of joint at the end of s3, and all of s4 was Walt trying to save his ass from Gus. He was down and out toward the end of s4 when handcuffed in the desert ... but he worked out then and there that he had just a slither of chance to turn the tables on him. His plan (which included saving Hanks ass btw) backfired when Skyler gave the $600k he needed to her fuckbuddy. Now he was toast .. Gus was going to slaughter his family.  And what does a man as smart as Walt do to get out of this pickle? Yes, desperate measures in poisoning a child, but he saved his whole family in doing so  The reason you hate walt was because of what you know about S5A. There he turned into top dog monster. He wasn't like that in S1-4, where he mostly spent his time wriggling out of impossible situations by outsmarting the real villains."
breakingbad,38xaus,jjolla888,37,Sun Jun 7 21:05:35 2015 UTC,"I'm more sympathetic of Walter than I am of Gus, even though the actions of the former are arguably more despicable throughout the series from what we've seen.  Gus made some questionable decisions which put children and other innocents in harm's way, but he mostly stuck to manipulating those already deep in criminal behavior.  Walter treated everyone, clean or dirty, as resources - his creativity was bred of necessity, rather than any innate aptitude for planing.  Walter was reactive; Gus, proactive.  It's far easier to place blame on someone willingly playing ""God"" than it is on someone working on baser instincts.  Gus was given multiple opportunities to back out of his arrangement with Walter yet chose to try and control him - he was toying with forces he couldn't comprehend, and by the time he realized how dangerous Walter was, Walter had won.   I'm not absolving Walter of his misdeeds - he displayed awareness of his actions and their consequences, and made excuses for his behavior.  But it's clear to me that Walter was a sick, desperate animal, who was consistently given ultimatums he couldn't reasonably abide by.  Conversely, Gus was always in control, always had leverage, and ultimately misused it.  Gus overestimated his abilities and underestimated his opponent, much like the Neo-Nazis, Hank, and Mike eventually did.  Walter was a force of nature; Gus was ""man"". Can we really blame the wind for blowing?"

Mike is also a professional and a pragmatist, world weary but very wise.  And Mike is clearly Gus's man (I hope we find out how this all comes about in Better Call Saul...), so I don't find it heard to see that there's a lot of charisma in Gus.  It's just that Walter was smarter and luckier."
breakingbad,38xaus,John0831,10,Mon Jun 8 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"Hank is a reactionary, obsessive asshole. He represents corruption in our government and a foaming-at-the-mouth type of police behavior. He is not a moral compass, as much as he likes to pretend he is."
breakingbad,38xaus,Deviant_Fart,12,Sun Jun 7 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"I find Hank to be a boorish, ex-jock jerk myelf, but corrupt...nah, don't think so.  In fact, he and Marie are the only (major) characters who don't compromise their beliefs in the course of their character arcs.  Walt does (duh), Jesse does (mostly 'cause Walt makes him), Skyler certainly does.  Even Ted Beneke is corrupt.  Hank is pretty much a dick, but Hank is an excellent cop:  Cops catch bad guys and that's all Hank does in the show.  That's it.  When he's recuping in Season 3/4 and not chasing bad guys, he's a monster to Marie (and most everyone else) until he reads back in on the Heisenberg case.  He's a predator, a ""great white"" in ASAC Merker's eyes, one that'ss got a simple code and he sticks to right until his last words, where he identifies himself by his rank, not his first name.  Nice guy?  No.  Corrupt, foaming at the mouth?  Bullshit."
breakingbad,38xaus,John0831,4,Sun Jun 7 22:15:22 2015 UTC,i wouldn't go as far as to say hank is a monster in season 3/4 he is a dick but because he is very clearly suffering greatly from his injury and has obvious PTSD.
breakingbad,38xaus,d00dical,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:03:17 2015 UTC,"it's purely reaction to his condition. He's got this whole tough guy image but he can't walk. How can he reconcile his injury and PTSD with how he sees himself? It's not possible, it tears him apart. He's reduced to collecting minerals rather than going on drug busts or doing real DEA work. So he throws it onto the only people who can handle it and stay with him, because they know he doesn't really mean it; his family. And it gets tough at times, he was a fucking dick to Marie, don't get me wrong, but he's not a monster. He's just taking out his pain on someone who it won't truly hurt (after all, by season 5 they were more or less OK again, certainly by the end of season 5 when they were concentrated on catching Walt they seemed reconciled).  And then he gets the Boetticher files and that leads him to the Heisenberg case, and he has something to do, an actual purpose rather than ""they're minerals""."

He was so broken but authentic and real. He was just himself. I started to see everything from Jessie's perspective and it made me question everything Walt did. I was overwhelmed by Jessie's soul or moral fight that it just made me feel for him so much more. You cannot justify what Walt's doing when you start seeing things from Jessie's point of view.

breakingbad,38xaus,Djet3k,-1,Sun Jun 7 17:56:05 2015 UTC,"Gus was my favourite character.  I think people exaggerate the writing of the show a bit when they say things like ""Walt is such a monster but I can't help but root for him!"" It's natural that people root for the protagonist. If the show was from Jesse's perspective, Walt would come across as more unsympathetic, and more of a prick.  The whole Walter White vs. Tony Soprano debate is interesting, because Walt's story begins at the beginning of the show, so we know where he's come from and it's easier to sympathise with him, whereas Tony had been in the game long before the beginning of The Sopranos. And when Tony does bad things, I feel that it's easier to find his actions more despicable. However, Tony does feel genuine remorse and is haunted by his actions. Walt on the other hand always seems to move on swiftly, and the only times he seems to feel anything resembling remorse is when it looks like it's going to come back and bite him."

Even if Walt was alive, the police would have caught him and he'd be in prison.   I'm sure Vince will tie in BB with Better Call Saul to maybe show the aftermath of Walt's family, Jesse, and others.

Walt Jr. refuses to listen to his own father when he's trying to explain something.  It's not the first time he's told him to go die either. In one of the very early episodes, when Walt says that he doesn't want to go through chemo and he says ""why don't you just fucking die? Just give up and die?"" Who actually talks to their parents the way he did? I don't have the best of relationships with my own father but I'd never, ever consider saying that to him, in a million years.

In the US it's usually between 10 and 23 episodes a season, with summer breaks, with the aim to do as many quality seasons as you can get out of the show, usually a goal of 7-10 seasons. In the UK it's a limited run of episodes, often no more than a couple dozen, with maybe 2-3 short seasons. In Hispanic markets it's often a long, uninterrupted daily run."

My main complaint is the terrible unnecessary background music added in (like really bad 70's porn music at serious parts of the show). Cinematography is not as good. Subtleties of the characters are lost. Certain humorous things are completely gone (e.g., no handjob while winning the bid on ebay, didn't tell Bogdan to fuck his eyebrows, Jesse/Jose didn't put that hilariously bad makeup over his black eye).  I'm still watching it mostly to brush up on my Spanish, but I don't know if I'll finish it. I rate Breaking Bad 10/10, but Metastasis compared to Breaking Bad, I'd rate it 4/10.   If Metastasis was its own show and wasn't being compared to Breaking Bad, I'd probably rate it a 7/10, to be fair."

For example one could complain why the U.S. bothered to make their own version of House of Cards which is a remake of the British show of the same name.  But Breaking Bad had a certain quality to it, that you can't fully replicate, I'm Hispanic-American, & I recommend that any non-english speaking latinos/Hispanic watch the dubbed version of Breaking Bad, but maybe the Colombian setting resonates more with them."

I can understand that if a show or movie is bad but someone sees a potiential in the story with better cinematography or better actors, than that is fine. But with a show like Breaking Bad, a near perfect show I can't really see the point in remaking it. Like why spend a money on trying to remake something that will always be better than what you are creating. I have never came across a movie or a show that I didn't watch because it's from England or because it's from the USA."
breakingbad,38vsa8,rappit4,5,Sun Jun 7 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"Remaking a movie like Robocop when the original is great, seems kind of pointless, but remaking a movie/show for a different language/country is not the same thing as that, as its a way of retelling the same story but more appealing for whatever reason to that country.  Yes people could just watch a dubbed version, but the setting, certain phrases or plot points might not be as famailer/understandable in a different country.  A lot of people will agree with you that Hollywood doing remakes of classic movies like (Forest Gump, Scarface) is very much discouraged.  But most people are disagreeing with you that remaking a movie/show in a different language/location is not pointless, since not everybody speaks English, or is into American culture. So I disagree with you on that.  You're watching British & American movie/shows where there is no language barrier but lets say you wanted to see a German or Italian movie, you could just watch it with subtitles or maybe its dubbed in English, but a American remake might be easier to digest the movie."

So what job can someone have that isn't well-respected and yet deals with chemistry and gives one access to the tools and gives you a plausible explanation for random high schoolers humiliating you? Chemistry teacher.  It's been in a fuckton of shows. Often they'll hand-wave it by having a line of dialogue:   Gee, isn't it great that this huge apartment is rent-controlled and owned by your grandmother?   But I don't recall them doing that in Breaking Bad.  I never took any chemistry classes in college. But pretty much all of my professors had a PhD.

Walt, a man of such stunted development and unrealized potential, who uses the ""I did it for my family"" justification to no end, has this idealized image of what a father is supposed to be. This likely stems from the only memory of his own father (410 Salud). This perfect father role is a false front that Walt has been showing ever since the Gray Matter fallout. Walt worked in whatever job(s) was necessary to support his family--but the fact is that it was a sliding scale from Gray Matter to HS Chem teacher that was based around his warped perception of the buyout and Gretchen incidents and likely the perceived judgment of his peers.   TLDR: Walt would never allow some stranger to be his son's chauffer. He barely accepted his son's best friend Lewis doing it. ""My bottle! My house! My son!""   The distinction in behavior must be drawn between what Walt (Mr. Chips) would do or what Scarface would do."

It's true that graduate programs in the U.S. sometimes differ from those elsewhere.  For example, I know that many PhD programs in the U.K are as short as 3 years.  But those programs are very different (in terms of structure and expectations) than similar ones in the U.S.  The average time to PhD completion in my graduate dept is 6 years, and I took over 7.  And for the record, 3 of my 4 dissertation chapters were published in top-tier journals (Heredity, Evolution, and PNAS), and I have numerous friends who published a portion of their PhD work in journals like Science, Nature, and The American Naturalist.  Journals such as these don't publish ""lousy"" studies.  Your generalization that PhD students aren't doing meaningful work is just plain wrong.

Such a qualified scientist but is only teaching high school chemistry to kids who don't even care about it.   I should say, there is nothing wrong with being a high school teacher; in fact, many of them do have a master's in either Teaching, the subject they're teaching, or both. But to add further to that resume is his time with Gray Matter and the work Gray Matter did and the impact of said work (drawing the Nobel Prize, I think?)  So I think it was simply to show that he was doing a job he was overqualified for, which happens a lot in real life as well. But his was a little more special/extraordinary. Soon afterwards he is diagnosed with cancer, another moment the viewer pities him, and then he comes home to Skylar and a physically disabled child.   Again, not shitting on the character, but I think his occupation was one part of the puzzle for the writers to extract pity from the viewers. It was a very glum life filled with monotony.   And then he starts cooking meth and his life shifts to the other end of the spectrum, away from monotony."

There's probably no ""good"" reason why he is just a high school teacher, other than that's how shit worked out. The fact that the viewer can see that he should be doing something better with his life—and this is something Walt realizes too—helps us rationalize his feelings of inferiority and wasted potential. For all intents and purposes, this is a guy who belongs in a much more demanding position. But he's wound up teaching high school, and that motivates his need to do something bigger before he dies."

But here's my thoughts:   Perhaps Walt didn't try to ""sell"" his research, but the fact that he failed has to be true; there are many ways to publicly humiliate yourself and be blacklisted by local institutions. If Walt had moved to another state, he might have gotten another job. But he chose to stay because of Skylar.  Gretchen and Elliot (during BB's run) are very successful, powerful, rich people. They offer Walt's treatment bill, which is a meal ticket compared to billionaires like them. They might have some resentment for Walt, but probably doing it for charity, good PR reasons, or even out of pity for Walt.  They know Walt's contribution to their company and know, that deep down, they owe him a big favor. Even that bullcrap all those years ago, he deserves much more than a cancer-riddled high school chemistry teacher."
breakingbad,38unh7,PaulMorel,3,Sun Jun 7 16:10:29 2015 UTC,This. This is explained in flashbacks in... season one or two iirc. Walt got cut out of a pharmaceutical company that was founded on the back of the work he did in grad school.

breakingbad,38unh7,GenericPie,2,Sun Jun 7 06:35:06 2015 UTC,"I assume after the Gray Matter debacle Walt needed to find work quickly to support his young family (Walt Jr would've just been born) and settled on teaching.   The Grey Matter fallout obviously knocked his confidence (compare pathetic Walt in episode 1 to the flashbacks of him confidently teaching and flirting with Gretchen) and over time, like so many people in life, he settled into a monotonous routine and became too afraid to branch out and fulfil his potential.   Throughout the first season it's repeatedly emphasised just how repressed, emasculated and pathetic Walt has become. Does he seem like the kind of man who would make it in academia or any form of competitive environment? He's but a shell of his former self and the safe, uninspiring job of chemistry teacher perfectly suits the man he has become."
breakingbad,38unh7,sklorbit,2,Sun Jun 7 03:09:53 2015 UTC,"The show starts with Walter having low self-worth. He lacked confidence, and because of this worked two jobs he was overqualified for. His life included many instances of being stepped on, whether by his boss at the car wash, his disrespectful students at school, or hank talking down to him on his birthday. These situations are the cause of Walter's ""breaking bad,"" and the cancer being the catalyst."
breakingbad,38unh7,jjolla888,2,Sun Jun 7 05:45:33 2015 UTC,"if you recall the scene in s1 (i think e4 or e5) when walt and skyler were looking to buy their house ... skyler was pregnant with jr and walt actually had one of those good jobs you are talking about .. at Sandia Labs  he also was driving a sports car and was bullish about the future.   the writers made a point of that. it's left to the viewer to interpret that when jr was born handicapped, walt gave up a high flying career (which likely would have taken him away from home a fair bit) just so he could help skyler with their child.  working at a school would provided very dependable hours .. a must for helping raising a kid with cerebral palsy.  walt did everything for the family ... right up to the point where he realised he only had 2 years to live and had done nothing for himself ... the rest is walt throwing caution to the wind and going for broke"
breakingbad,38unh7,IFartConfetti,2,Sun Jun 7 05:49:52 2015 UTC,"His main flaw is his ego, so I imagine that's it.  If he taught at a university level, he might find someone that's better than him, and there's a much lower chance of that in high school."
breakingbad,38unh7,mr-mobius,2,Sun Jun 7 08:01:36 2015 UTC,I think it added to the idea that Walt didn't like taking risks before the cancer diagnosis. He often settled for less than he could have achieved because it was safer.
breakingbad,38unh7,Hello_Wisconsin,2,Sun Jun 7 12:17:36 2015 UTC,I'm a professor with a PhD from a large ivy-league.  University and/or college-level teaching and research is not for everyone.  There are aspects of my job that I love and aspects that I don't.  Just because a person has a terminal degree in their field doesn't mean they will be happiest as a prof or making lots of money in the private sector.  Teaching at the K-12 level can be a rewarding alternative.  I've volunteered at the junior high and high school level and really enjoyed it.
breakingbad,38unh7,GreyRobb,2,Sun Jun 7 13:12:51 2015 UTC,"Because if he was a college professor, the whole ""I have dramatically underachieved my potential in this life, and I am resentful for it"" motivation for him to become The Full Heisenberg wouldn't have played as well.  And also because sometimes life just works out that way. He sold his shares for rent money, left the company he helped found over jealousy, and took a job he was dramatically overqualified for just to have a paycheck to feed his growing family. Real people do these things all the time. Decisions that felt reasonable or good or necessary at the time, but with 20 or 30 years of hindsight haunt you."

I think, maybe, just wildly guessing here, he might have gone fully into the Grey matter business, but then something happened. Something which made him feel uncomfortable, or angry, or that he should leave. (Maybe the love relationship developing between Getchen and Elliot? Since we know Walt had a soft spot for Getchen. He could have gotten jealous, had a falling out, and then decided to 'just leave')  And then... either way this was before or after he married Skylar (anyone knows?), but I guess he wanted to stay close to home and be there for Skylar and Junior, since he probably needed more help with his CP when he was younger. Because of this, he takes a high school teaching job? Years pass by... and the job which was supposed to be temporary becomes long-term. Afraid of losing the stability they have now, and possibly not being sharp enough for renowned research anymore, he stays with the teaching job.   Just a wild hunch. I'd love to know from Vince what was HIS idea on what happened. Maybe Walt thinks it's all Gretchen/Elliot/other people's fault, while he fucked it up himself. Wouldn't be very much out of character for him."

breakingbad,38unh7,Nogarda,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:01:27 2015 UTC,"Walt's an idealist. He doesn't necessarily care what he does, so long as he can do his best at it. He does the 'menial' car wash job in the beginning but he at least tries his best, but is constantly being told it isn't good enough so he eventually quits, because what he hates more than anything is trying so hard only to be told it isn't good enough.  High school chemistry however is something he knows, he knows extremely well, and rather than teach older kids who are somewhat set in their ways, he wants to impassion a younger generation of kids in chemistry. But we come in when the ideal and dream of doing it is wearing thin, he's still trying but he knows he isn't really getting through to anyone.  Then we meet Jesse, a kid Walt considers a dropout not worth the time of day, but during the perfect storm of money woes, a mid-life crisis and a job he is losing passion for, a second job he quit and a lackluster sex life. He saw Jesse's meth and saw potential because his meth was decent and the only one he learnt chemistry from was Walt, so Jesse becomes his project and we know the rest. Walt had an idea to make at least one student of his care enough about chemistry to go places with it, and in the weird twisted way he sees it in Jesse, making his ideal a reality essentially. This is partly why him ever going back to teach is just a show and a easy cover for the writers until they can safely write him out of it."

Since Elliot ""Got the girl"") , he had a sick kid and needed to support him right then and couldn't afford to wait until the company took off, realized what a mistake he made selling his chunk of the business. And got depressed/ gave up.  I think the fact that he gave up, settled, and is a broken man is a huge part of the storyline.  If he was to his potential in his career he wouldn't have let his ego take over in the form of Heisenberg later in the show.... He had plenty of money, he kept doing it because it felt good to go to his full potential at something in life...."
breakingbad,38unh7,lanternsinthesky,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"Well I think Walt made many poor decisions in his life, that lead him to the place he is at the begging of the series. This really quiet, weak, and depressed guy who has no ambitions, and even less self-esteem. I think people forget that Walt is not a great guy, and he has really poor decisions making skills.. sure he is brilliant, but he is also kind of an asshole who relies more on pride than doing what is right."
breakingbad,38unh7,Shinjetsu01,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:52:02 2015 UTC,Maybe he just wanted to teach?

breakingbad,38unh7,claytonbarkley,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:52:34 2015 UTC,"Isn't a crucial part of his psychological make-up the fact that he was plagued by a chronic sense of inadequacy? People that have this sense of inadequacy tend to develop narcissistic, perfectionist ego selfs that they live in accordance with privately - its quite likely Heisenberg was there long before the cancer, and the cancer just led him to acting on it. I imagine he got Skylar pregnant, took a quick easy job and just never pushed himself beyond because he was at a comfortable level for his true self."
breakingbad,38unh7,DJSamDiamond,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:59:31 2015 UTC,"Most of the focus here seems to be on Walt's qualifications or lack of resume items to have a better position.  I don't think it's that he's limited intellectually/academically (i.e. Doctorates).  It's that his motivation is shot.  He's been on a team that's won a Nobel Prize.  He's seen people he was close to take advantage of his situation, ""helping him out"" when he needed money, and then go on to be wildly successful, leaving him behind.  Why should he even WANT to try and get in that sort of situation again?  Teaching at the local high school is a fantastic opportunity (or so he's told himself).  He can still be involved in chemistry, he's got his summers off to be with his family, and he can inspire young minds with his passion for science!  Of course, his passion is met with disinterest from the students...  The same need to provide that draws him to the Heisenberg side, is the need to foster education and share his knowledge.  It's why when he reached out to Jesse about making Meth, he found an outlet for teaching someone.  That's why he can't let Jesse go.  That's why Heisenberg consumes him.  It fulfills all his definitions of purpose; as though it's what he was made to do."

As for""Remember my name"" thats definitely a hat tip to when  Walt says, ""Say my name."" The alternate ending wasnt a  real alternate ending, it was just a joke. It was bryan cranston  waking up in bed next to jane kaczmarek. Ala Hal from Malcome in the middle waking up next to Lois having a bad dream that he was a meth dealer and murderer. Its great"

breakingbad,38psac,BangEndedScoot,9,Fri Jun 5 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"I found it great how Walt's downfall came at the hands of, not a huge crime syndicate, but a bunch of small time hicks. After killing Gus, Walt's ego was uncontrollable: ""I'm the man who killed Gus Fring."" He thought he really was the King after taking out the kingpin, only for this group of chancers to appear and fuck everything up for him.  It was the pathetically fitting endgame that Walt deserved."
breakingbad,38psac,thisishardcore_,13,Sat Jun 6 21:55:19 2015 UTC,"I really liked their inclusion. Starting in season 5, there was no more big bad. There were just a group of criminals, which included Walt. Gus was around since season 2. He was the boss of the series. After him, the boss was Walt, and the White Supremacists were aiming for Walt's position the same way he was aiming for Gus'.   I also liked them because they were the first group that felt really ""real."" I, personally have never come into contact with a person who runs a drug running business/empire the way Tuco and Gus did.  I have, however, come into contact with Blatant racists and Anti-semites. Gus had class about him and seemed untouchable. This group of people were scum, sloppy, and I was not the least bit surprised of their betrayal towards Walt.   Gus was the Big Bad Boss of the show. The rest is about Walt trying to sustain this new power he obtained and the low-lifes that are making a play at it."
breakingbad,38psac,somefuzzypants,6,Fri Jun 5 22:10:44 2015 UTC,"I remember in an interview a little while back, Vince Gilligan said that for season 5, he wanted the main antagonists to be a group of people that the audience would hate that Walt would be able to shoot with the machine gun shown in the beginning of the season. So essentially, he chose the nazis because they are - for the most part - hated by everyone, so they're an easy group of people for the audience to hate. So in that regard, I guess you could make the case that their inclusion in the series was kinda half-assed or lazy."
breakingbad,38psac,Novickk,10,Sat Jun 6 06:29:31 2015 UTC,"As great as this show is I think that most people agree that 5A is the least great (you have to say ""least great"" because no season is bad) And basically after Gus died there was no more bad guy to be frank; so a new one had to be created. And it should not be a surprise that at that point in time with the type of person Walt had become he would be associated with people like Jack and his crew. As for Walt vs. Hank or Jesse, thats what 5B was all about"
breakingbad,38psac,ackchanticleer,2,Fri Jun 5 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like 5B was more of a redemption story for Walt. I, for one, actually pitied him. He was a horrible, awful, terrible, no-good person, but he was pitiful and truly sad and though I hated him to his core, I felt pity for him."
breakingbad,38psac,JeremyJK1122,2,Fri Jun 5 20:44:36 2015 UTC,I feel the opposite.  I think I might have watched different show but I never see Walt as the bad guy at all.  He might have got carried away with the Empire but he never forgot his family.
breakingbad,38psac,eva_brauns_team,3,Sun Jun 7 16:34:10 2015 UTC,"I thought the Big Bad of the final season was actually Walt. He's the one who summoned those devils to begin with - in order to take out the ten men in prison that Walter didn't want to pay anymore - so it was poetic irony when they took the upper hand. It's like the tale of the scorpion and the frog. Walt was an idiot for getting into bed with them in the first place and then acted all butthurt when they robbed him and killed his brother-in-law. The fact that he was 'defeated' not by some grand genius like Fring, but an entity a lot more prosaic and a little more brutal really drove the point home that Walter was not the criminal master mind he had come to believe he was. It was a great puncture to his ego, made all the more devastating by the loss of everything he ever cared about. Ruined. Turned to shit. Dead. He had nothing. No one. It was all gone.  Neo-nazis seemed like lazy villains in theory, but the writers actually made them an interesting lot. I liked the little family that Jack, Todd, and Kenny sort of represented. I mean, sure they were murdering pieces of shit, but they also had a kind of integrity that - dare I say it - Walter lacked. It was a nice dichotomy. Jack had no qualms about putting a bullet in a cop's head, but then he's disgusted by his crew's greed and is willing to leave Walt a barrel simply by virtue of his nephew's respect. I didn't see them as flat stereotypes, but as real, flesh and blood people. And realistically, former convicts with ties to the AB dealing meth and getting into turf wars? Not really a stretch."
breakingbad,38psac,Honky_Cat,3,Sun Jun 7 05:01:26 2015 UTC,"I think you have to look at it from a point of how real life works - Sometimes something that seems so out of place, or so insignificant at the time later on becomes a huge part of the direction your life takes.  At first Uncle Jack and crew were just ancillary characters, but ultimately their actions ended up being the downfall of Walt's world."
breakingbad,38psac,mrwho995,3,Sat Jun 6 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind it, but it sure does sound as dumb as hell on paper. If I heard the antagonists in a TV show finale were neo-Nazis and I hadn't seen the show before, I'd immediately assume that show was awful.   As far as antagonists go they weren't too incredible, but they didn't really have to be. They served their narrative purpose and played their part, and allowed everything else to shine."

breakingbad,38o9rf,gers1978,22,Fri Jun 5 14:35:03 2015 UTC,"You don't notice Skyler's trip to the dark side so much, because she's is eclipsed by Walt. But that's where she went.  She kicked Walt out of the house for selling drugs. But a while later, she's up to her neck in money laundering, every bit as much a criminal as Walt was (as far as she knows).  Skyler's threshold for acceptable behavior slid quite a bit in that couple years."
breakingbad,38o9rf,1wiseguy,2,Fri Jun 5 18:23:16 2015 UTC,I always thought a lot of time passes between him saying he's out in Gliding O'er All and the final scene of that episode.
breakingbad,38o9rf,waitingonthatbuffalo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:36:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think they handed Skyler's sudden change very well, honestly. She went from telling Walt she's waiting for his cancer to come back to being seemingly perfectly cordial with him a few episodes later. The nonsecality of Skyler's seemingly sudden change in episode 9 is probably the weakest aspect of season 5 for me.   That said, episode 8 covered a lot of time, much more time than a usual episode did, in the montage. Skyler wanted her kids back and Walt hadn't been too insufferable for a while, so I think she just tried to make the best with what she had. She definitely didn't love Walt at any point in season 5; I'm pretty sure they never had sex even though they were sleeping in the same bed. In that scene where Walt collapses you talk about, Walt asks Skyler whether she'd be happy if he died, and she said ""I can't remember the last time I was happy"". I think that probably best sums up season 5b Skyler, trying to do her very best to hold together and salvage the tatters of what remains of her famiy and her life."

breakingbad,38j6k7,chiguy440,54,Thu Jun 4 19:21:30 2015 UTC,"Knowing what he has done up to the ""I'm the one who knocks scene"" he IS exaggerating about how dangerous he is. At that point, if I am not mistaken, Gus is a massive threat to him.  He may not be a blowfish entirely, but he is in this scene."
breakingbad,38j6k7,UltimaLyca,27,Thu Jun 4 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"My feelings exactly. At this point in the series, Walt has had every plan he has cooked up go wrong in some way, and at this point in the season he has on multiple occasions been shown that he is not as powerful or as important as he thinks he is, and even in this moment when he is trying to show himself to be tough and important after getting beaten up by Mike, he doesn't have anywhere to go with it, and ends up going to take a shower as his wife walks out on him. I feel that contrast between words and context is important in this scene, and this scene should be examined as something more than a ""Wow so badass"" moment."
breakingbad,38j6k7,chiguy440,-4,Thu Jun 4 20:35:20 2015 UTC,"What? No it's not an exaggeration, he's telling the literal truth. He sent someone and they knocked..   Edit: I'm not denying he performs though. But this conclusion is ridiculous to me."
breakingbad,38j6k7,mrwho995,2,Thu Jun 4 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"Essentially the entire point of Walt's 'one who knocks' speech was to demonstrate his hubris and delusions of grandure. At that point in the series he was on death's door and in absolutely no control of his life. He could have realistically made the speech after Gus's death and it'd have some weight behind it, but given its position in the series and the context surrounding it, clearly the intention of the scene isn't (just) 'look how much of a badass Walt is!'."
breakingbad,38j6k7,FaerieStories,3,Sun Jun 7 06:31:25 2015 UTC,"That doesn't mean he isn't a performer. The Heisenberg persona he adopts is nothing if not a performance designed to convince his own conscience that the bad things he does come from an alter-ego rather than himself. As he changes, his domestic life becomes the performance: he finds himself slipping into the role of the drug tyrant and forgetting how to be a family man.   Walt is the latter-day Macbeth, and Macbeth (the play) is very much about appearances vs reality in respect to issues like power and evil. ""To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself""."

Walt intimidation/bluff is the norm and not the exception. Besides, Walt did kill many people, some of them heavily protected, and most of is wouldn't mess with someone with such a story."
breakingbad,38j6k7,Hooze,6,Thu Jun 4 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"Walter killed at least 8 people on his own, depending on how you look at it.  Additionally, he set up the death of Gus and Hector.

breakingbad,38j6k7,Hooze,6,Thu Jun 4 18:30:45 2015 UTC,"No, he killed 8 people directly.  The two drug dealers in season 1 that came out to the desert.  He kills two of Gus's drug dealers that were using kids by hitting them with his Pontiac and then shooting one of them.  He kills two guards in the lab after Gus's death.  He kills Mike.

Also, and this is very important, Walt ended the relationship with Gretchen and left Grey Matter of his own decision.  Walt didn't feel good enough for her and her family - this was in a discussion between Walt and Gretchen.

That being said, the best explanation to your question is that Walt is (or at least was) a jerk. He got bored with his involvement in the company, he got bored with his relationship with Gretchen, and rather than wait them both out he just up and bailed (while he and Gretchen were on vacation together, no less!) and left Gretchen and Elliott to pick up the pieces. And then, when they're worth billions and he's working a second job as a car wash attendant, he blames them and becomes a criminal and murderer because he feels cheated. He feels cheated because he quit and screwed over his two best friends.  Yeah, Walt was a jerk. Whether he still is or not is up for debate."
breakingbad,38oo3p,YossarianPrime,4,Fri Jun 5 19:55:44 2015 UTC,"Walt is an irredeemable Jerk.    As a family man, I fully realized that the moment the two Mexican brothers were in the house where his baby slept.  There is no way to justify exposing your family to that kind of risk."
breakingbad,38nddy,yoyo9797,23,Fri Jun 5 09:45:01 2015 UTC,"Initially, I think he did it for his family. But as his success grew he became more powerful and that satisfied his ego so he did it for himself. As he said ""I liked it. I was good at it"". It was his way of compensating for losing out on Grey Matter."
breakingbad,38nddy,beckerola,4,Fri Jun 5 11:19:54 2015 UTC,"I think both.  I believe he genuinely cared about his family, and really wanted to do ""the right thing"" for them, at least in the beginning. But nonetheless felt envigorated more than he ever did before... a feeling of fearlessness and being alive he had never tasted before. And for a long time he believed HIMSELF that he did it entirely for his family (""If you just knew all the sacrifices I made for this family!""), it's just when Hank got killed he realized that the consequences weren't just coming for HIM, but for everyone around him. That he had let himself get intoxicated on the thrill of being in power, and blinded himself blind for the harm he did."
breakingbad,38nddy,ErikEzrin,3,Fri Jun 5 14:33:36 2015 UTC,he did it for himself all along. heisenberg was awaken.

breakingbad,38nddy,aidsfarts,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:48:53 2015 UTC,"He did it all for himself. In the pilot it's clear he doesn't feel successful or happy and he isn't the boss of anything in his life, including his marriage. Telling Jesse how things are done, being in control of the meth business, that's what made him happy, more than his own family made him happy. He justified what he was doing by saying it was for his family."

breakingbad,37zxuf,spectralconfetti,2,Mon Jun 1 10:39:16 2015 UTC,"OP here. My intention was never to give VG and the writers credit for having all of this planned out in advance and to a T. But the symbolism is very clear in many of these examples. I made these conclusions based on the narrative as a whole.   You must understand as well that Walt and really all the characters evolve so much throughout the course of the series that symbols, themes and motifs may take on either different meanings or less impact as character's motivations are in flux."
breakingbad,37zxuf,shazarava,6,Mon Jun 1 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed Walt was a greedy and corrupt fuck from the start. This just helped me flesh out the details of it. If you notice, Walt is always pushing for more money. Even when they're making literally fucking millions and millions he needs more. Before that, when they were making enough to just pay the bills, Walt needed more. Jesse always suggested to stop and be happy with what he has, but Walt always needed more money.   Another note, and this may be my past with addiction coming up, is that this is very reminiscent of a man falling deeper and deeper into a meth addiction. Not just the addiction, but the life of addiction. More money, more meth, more, more, more. That is what an addict seeks.... more of everything..."
breakingbad,37zxuf,rphillip,6,Mon Jun 1 04:58:26 2015 UTC,"I've always thought of the whole show as using the meth Walt makes as a metaphor. It's breaking up his family, making him erratic, paranoid, generally sending his life in a downward spiral."

The critics were all over the meaning of the Ensure box being too 'on the nose' after Granite State aired, but I thought it was a nice bit of humor from the writers, given how damn bleak that episode was.  And obviously, in the earlier seasons, Walter wore a lot of green to denote his complete fixation on money. The way his need to leave something for his family subtly changed to out-and-out greed was a sly way to depict his moral decline.  In every example that you've given, the location of the money was definitely meant to be symbolic by the writers."

The ending, although not the most 'dramatic' wasn't very surprising or shocking, but it was very emotionally satisfying, and really gave it all a good 'closure'. Though I would have liked it in two parts, since some bits (like how Walt gets back and gets in touch with skinny pete and badger, staying out of police grasp) seemed a bit rushed, and then we could also have seen more of the family, and stuff going on in Albuquerque ASIDE Walt trying to tie up loose ends."
breakingbad,382ggz,thisishardcore_,2,Mon Jun 1 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"I thought Felina did a good job of tying most things up. But it would have been nice to see Walt at least attempt to make some kind of reconciliation with Marie before he died because apart from Jesse she's arguably the one who was affected the worst by his actions out of those who were still alive. That was the only thing that I don't think the writers did right, the way they basically left her out in the cold."

Everything, would have be shot the same but at night and the audience fully knows that these sirens are for Walt.  Every one talked about the allegories of series. One big one was that Heisenberg and Walt were two different characters. I wanted Walt to kill Heisenberg. No one was able to stop Heisenberg. Not Gus, not Hank, not even cancer. Walt was always in control in some way. And he was, in my mind, the one to stop Heisenberg.  Instead, we have that chance was always in control. Walt accidentally shot himself while sirens came. I still love the ending, I just hyped it up way too much."

breakingbad,382vjc,anon2413,11,Mon Jun 1 13:36:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting, yes, but a total coincidence. In fact, even the teddy bear in the pool, which is often refferenced as a ""Face Off"" foreshadowing, was just nothing but coincidence.  Why? Because at that point the writers hadn't even decided that Gus would be Walt's opponent at the time. They initially planned this role to be on Tio, but because they were so impressed by Giancarlo's performance as Gus, they decided to have Gus take this position. So it cannot be anything more than pure, (99,1%, bitch!) very fortunate, coincidence."
breakingbad,382vjc,ErikEzrin,5,Mon Jun 1 15:56:11 2015 UTC,"Just because it isn't foreshadowing doesn't mean that it's always a coincidence. There is this thing called BACKWRITING.

So many times later in the series VG and co. would look back upon previous events, symbols and themes and use them as a guide and often write back to a previous idea and thus giving it more significance and weight.   Therefore, no it's technically not foreshadowing in that it wasn't plotted out chronologically. But if you take Breaking Bad as a single work/solitary narrative one can consider it foreshadowing in a way.   It's very hard to define foreshadowing on account of televised, long form narratives consistently adapting and changing. Previously, the common definition of foreshadowing was a literary term--derived from a set narrative structure--not a changing one."
breakingbad,382vjc,dimplepinch,4,Tue Jun 2 20:58:58 2015 UTC,The teddy bear half face was alluding to the two sides of Walt.  Also the frequent use of mirrors with Walt's image.  But in Face-off just before Gus gets out of the car at the nursing home look at the shadow on one half the drivers face.  That I think is direct foreshadowing.
breakingbad,382vjc,malcontented,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"THAT could be a case of foreshadowing, yes! You'd have to ask Vince to be sure, of course, but I think it's very well possible. As for the bear, that sounds like a much more plausible explanation indeed.   Gotto watch out with the mirrors though. Mirror images are used in movies and tv all the time. lately I was watching a movie with what seemed to be a 'bad' character who was hiding things (added to that he also had a bald head, glasses, and a beard. So the connection was made quickly), and at some points I saw 'mirror' scenes which were almost remiscent of breaking bad. I was all like ""YEAH BITCH! I GOT YOU! You totally got a 'heisenberg' side!"" and in the end... it appeared to be totally the other way around, and he was actually the good guy, lol.  Oh, I felt so mindfucked. XD"
breakingbad,382vjc,ErikEzrin,2,Mon Jun 1 21:31:54 2015 UTC,Except VG said (around S2 finale time) regarding the pink bear's burnt face that it might mean something later and that he was toying with an idea.

Pollos Hermanos franchises across 4 states would've easily allowed him to live quite lavishly without throwing up any red flags.   His goal of course was never money - He already had money and would have made tons of money running a legit business operation in Pollos Hermanos anyways. Gus was more interested in revenge against Don Eladio and Hector; in the flashback scene from 4.08 after Max is killed by Hector; Don Eladio tells Gus his place is to handle chicken, not drugs. Gus wanted to prove the cartel wrong and show that he can handle drugs better than them. The fact that he can pass as a community-oriented businessman running a successful chain of fast food restaurants for so long is just gravy."

For instance, shooting Mike while it was completely unnecassery and avoidable. (not to say that the choice to cook meth, which is basically poison to the body and mind, was very good. But at least he STARTED with noble intentions)  Even though he did many bad things, manipulated a lot of people, etc. I rooted for him till the end, and it was actually just after I finished the series and shared my thoughts with others I started to feel guilty and 'wrong' for doing so. In fact, I didn't just root for him, I RELATED to him. Not so much to the crimes, nor the lies, but to a lot of other things he said and went through.  I think it's pretty courageous of you to come out with this opinion, as I know MANY people don't agree, and the others who do don't dare to say it. It's a honesty Walter never posessed, and I think that (self) honesty is one of the most important virtues one can have. I actually think if he had been completely honest to himself, he'd never have broken bad in the first place."
breakingbad,384pc2,ErikEzrin,4,Mon Jun 1 21:22:53 2015 UTC,"Good point. Thanks for your reply all my friends are just jokingly calling me a sociopath. But, although I forgot the context of Mike's death, I have to say Mike, although likable, wasn't entirely innocent. He was prepared to kill Walter before so it's not like he didn't adhere to the self-preservation idea. He was always a liability and he could have ruined everything Walter worked for."
breakingbad,384pc2,ErikEzrin,2,Mon Jun 1 21:32:56 2015 UTC,"True. But Mike only did so because it was his job, not because of personal interest or ego. He was prepared to kill Walter just because Gus ordered him to, and when Mike gets an order, he carries it out dutifully. That's what he does. But no, he definitely wasn't entirely innocent either. He killed people without even a flinch.  But yeah, I know your feel. My friends are claiming I'm totally crazy as well, and you wouldn't know how many times I've been called a ""psycho"" on the internet just for being honest about my views. That's why I keep them to myself most of the time now. I don't even claim he is innocent or a full out 'good guy' or whatever, I just take the middle ground by saying I don't believe he's ""evil"" and that I can relate to him and understand a lot of the things he did, if viewed from his perspective.  It just bothers me a lot that people who don't even know me just point blank decide I'm a ""psycho"" just because I can empathise with this character (if ANYTHING that makes me everything BUT a psycho!) and even relate to him at some point."

Sure, he enjoyed the money and power, that's why he eventually gave in, but if they wouldn't have pressed him to continue (like, when he were just a standard meth cook with a standard product), I'm sure he'd have gotten out of it way sooner.

I shall remind it for you...  Walt was dragged out into the desert by Gus, whom threatened his wife, son, and infant daughter. He knew that the ONLY reason Gus spared his life was because Jesse was still loyal to him. But how long would this loyalty last if he could never see him again? Weeks? Months? Definitely not forever at least.  After this, he tried to flee with his entire family, using the Vacuum Repair Guy, but because Skylar gave all of his money to Ted (also in an attempt save both their asses), this option was made impossible.  If he'd flee on his own, chances are Gus would track him down. Besides that did Walt realize he could never take on Gus on his own. Thus he came up with a risky and, yes, moraly ambigious plan to get back in touch with Jesse. (NON LETHALLY!) poison a kid, in order to save himself, his wife, his son and his infant daughter.   It sure was very wrong, but what else should he have done? Hand himself over to Gus and get killed? Let's remember that even though poisoning a kid doesn't rank high on a list of virtues, Brock got off it (relatively) unharmed."
breakingbad,384pc2,ErikEzrin,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:20:03 2015 UTC,The OP argued that Walter did nothing wrong. I was only arguing the opposite. Whether his actions were justified or not is kind of irrelevant in this situation.

Controversial point that will probably be downvoted but......in my opinion everything Hitler or Bin Laden did was wrong, but in their eyes it was justified because of the what he believed in. By your logic what they did can't be wrong because it's justified by them. But that's the difference between how you feel and what you believe in and what they feel and what they believe in.  You and Walt feel his actions wre justified and therefore not wrong.  They were wrong and justification is down to how the individual feels or what they believe in, just because you believe it was justified, it doesn't make it so.  There is a massive difference between the two."

They were as well, too blinded from the truth to see what harm they were doing, and that they weren't doing ""the right thing"" at all.

I'm no saying he's right, but there has to be some ""relatability"" to him because he was always put in the situation where he had to make that choice. As for shooting Mike, yes he was wrong in doing that because ""he didn't have to"". But Mike was willing to kill Walter just a few seasons ago on Gus' orders. I say if someone smites you on one cheek, smash them on the other. I'm not saying the guy was a saint, and after reading all your comments I would venture to change the title of the post to something a little less polarizing, but he didn't deserve everything that happened to him-- and Vince Gilligan always said that Breaking Bad takes place in a moral universe, one where everyone gets what they deserve.

breakingbad,37wqd7,funknut,5,Sun May 31 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"You are correct, ""timestamp"" is the preferred term for the signature identifying a point in time in a video, but ""timestamp"" is another awkward term, as if each millisecond occurring since January 1st 1970 is somehow uniquely ""stamped"" in digital media; it's not. Not to take qualms with your usage of the term, just a little rumination/digression for a moment here. Timestamp is also ambiguously used in programming for just that, uniquely stamping a point in time for later reference. In regards to arbitrarily returning the timer to an earlier point in history, I'm not sure why ""signature"" or ""code"" wasn't adopted instead. It's still easier to say ""rewind"" than it is to say ""return to the timestamp"" and everyone still seems to say so, at least in-person, maybe not much in online discussions."
breakingbad,37wqd7,Xicon,1 point,Sun May 31 20:16:16 2015 UTC,Timestamp typically refers to a more literal stamp - when the time is printed on the video or photo in question. Timecode is the digital signature identifying a point in time in a video file.

Very much broken. I just feel... so much sadness underneath his anger... that is why... I can't ever hate him or condemn him.   I want to shake him back and forth to get some sense into him though."

When he said something along the lines of ""you're the smartest guy I've ever met, but you're too stupid to see what's right in front of you"" or something like that, he acknowledged that Walt was in way over his head and was too naive to realize how evil the folks he was dealing with actually were."

breakingbad,3823fm,Mordant_Misanthrope,3,Sat Jun 6 04:17:49 2015 UTC,"I think so, yes.   I was actually surprised that Hank didn't even stop for a second after he found out that Walt was Heisenberg to ask himself: ""HOW, and WHY could this EVER happen!?""  I mean, I would be totally mindfucked if I found out my uber meek and geeky brother-in-law appeared to be a dangerous drug kingpin. I'd feel deceived, sure, and I'd probably never trust a single person ever again in my life, but most of all, I'd be VERY much mindfucked, and wonder why and how a person could transform this way."

Wouldn't you be about halfway there already after finding out about Gus Fring? He already knows from that and other cases that criminality doesn't obey any particular boundaries. Honestly if you're working on that level of Law Enforcement you can't make decisions based on impression and prejudice, you have to follow where the evidence leads.   When Walt says ""his name is Hank"" and Hank says his name is ""ASAC Schrader"", Hank is making a bold statement on what defines his life - he stands with the law, right or wrong, even if it's against family. It's an interesting counterpoint - Walt defined himself as Heisenberg and saw no limit or other justification needed for his ego aggrandizement, Hank's personal ego fulfillment was limited to fantasizing about making his own brand of microbrew beer in the garage."

Quite possibly two of the most pulse pounding climaxes of the series (up there with Half Measures, Face Off, and Ozymandias). And they seemed to use the layered dramatic resolution in Crawl Space as almost an homage to that layered climax of Mandala. Both scenes have incredible scores that really add a lot to each. in 411 you can tell just how sadly upset and hurt Walt was when Skyler answers the question where's the money. ""I gave it to Ted""...""you...did what..."" my heart totally dropped at that moment.

There is the circle of addiction, of moral dilemma (cooking books), and yes of life and death. Walt following the death of Combo is adamant in Saul's office in 211 ""Payback. That's what we need."" And just like that, Walt is introduced to Gustavo Fring literally as a reflection in the Pollos window. Saul presents him as ""From what I DO hear he sounds a little bit like you."" ""I was told the man I was meeting was a cautious man...I believe we're alike in that way.""   Furthermore I don't think it's a stretch to say that because Jesse was so affected by the death of Combo, that VG and the writers planned to eventually in some way circle back to that event. Not only did they circle back, they thematically linked 411 with many of the ideas and motifs presented in 211."

breakingbad,37sin5,SuperGanondorf,6,Sun May 31 09:25:38 2015 UTC,"He redeemed himself as much as he ever possibly COULD, unless he had the power to turn back time.  It wasn't >fully< since he couldn't undo the harm he did, obviously. If heaven and hell would exist, and I were to judge over Walter, I'd not throw him into the deepest shithole there is in hell, but I'd not send him to heaven either."
breakingbad,37sin5,ErikEzrin,10,Sat May 30 07:50:59 2015 UTC,Hell no.  How many people died because of him?  He'd need 100 reincarnated lives as Mother Teresa before he'd be redeemed.
breakingbad,37sin5,malcontented,2,Sat May 30 01:11:06 2015 UTC,"I'm doing a rewatch right now, and this was just brought up by the part in Fly where he tells Jessie to drop it. It just made me think maybe he had some humanity left, whereas I previously thought that he'd lost it all at that point."
breakingbad,37sin5,malcontented,2,Sat May 30 01:24:40 2015 UTC,"By the end he *somewhat redeems himself to some people but still their lives are ruined because of him.  This includes Skylar and Jesse.  Then you have to add in all the innocent people, like on the airplanes, and there's no way he could ever fully redeem himself."
breakingbad,37sin5,jflewis4,5,Sat May 30 02:27:43 2015 UTC,"Then you have to add in all the innocent people, like on the airplanes,    I think Walt's redemption there would have to be small.  Walt's role in the crash is merely one of timing.  He happened to be in the house the moment Jane was dying.  Had Walt arrived 30 minutes later the result would have been the same , and the crash still occurs.  Its not in the category of that crash would not have happened but for Walt.  We can't say the same for Jesse. For it was Jesse that re-introduced Jane to drugs."
breakingbad,37sin5,MadBigMadBoatMan,5,Sat May 30 15:19:17 2015 UTC,"Watch the scene again. Jane is lying on her side when Walt enters.Walt then  tries to shake Jesse awake, and in doing so, he rolls Jane over on her back. If she'd vomited while lying on her side, she would've lived. So Walt doesn't just watch her die, he causes her death."
breakingbad,37sin5,jflewis4,1 point,Sun May 31 05:30:25 2015 UTC,"Good point, but go back earlier in that episode when Jesse shoots up he immediately lies on his back, and Jane tells Jesse to lie on his side in case he throws up, and then props a pillow on his back.  Why would Jane do this with the pillow unless she was fully aware that Jesse might roll over on his back while sleeping ? Most likely she probably witnessed it before.  But notice the next night when Walt finds them, no such precaution against rolling over was taken with the pillows for either Jane or Jesse.  They were both impaired and neither one could take the precaution for the other.  Any number of things could have caused Jane to roll over, Jesse moving on his own, the phone ringing etc.  Jane died because she was impaired, not because Walt rolled her on he side. Why was she impaired ? Because she took Heroin that Jesse re-introduced her to.  Yes Walt watched her die and did nothing to save her. But Jesse is the one who caused her death."
breakingbad,37sin5,MadBigMadBoatMan,2,Sun May 31 12:40:30 2015 UTC,At least she got a rock'n'roll death.
breakingbad,37sin5,mrwho995,1 point,Sun May 31 16:12:33 2015 UTC,"That may be true but it's a whole bunch of hypotheticals. Walt directly caused Jane's death. There's a big chance she could have died anyway without Walt's interference, but the specific reason she died is because Walt accidentally rolled her over."
breakingbad,37sin5,jflewis4,2,Sun May 31 22:39:50 2015 UTC,"but the specific reason she died is because Walt accidentally rolled her over.   What you're pointing to is merely the contributing factor, not the cause.  The entire event was completely survivable had she not been impaired.  Why was she impaired ?, the answer to that is the reason she died."
breakingbad,37sin5,malcontented,1 point,Sun May 31 23:10:39 2015 UTC,Good points.  But Walt certainly felt guilty about it.  Remember the speech scene at school.?  That was hard to watch
breakingbad,37sin5,jflewis4,1 point,Sun May 31 04:55:28 2015 UTC,"True, her Father felt guilty too.  Remember he let her talk him out of immediately sending her to rehab the day before.  It was that guilt that led him to distraction at work which resulted in the plane crash."
breakingbad,37sin5,malcontented,2,Sun May 31 23:13:54 2015 UTC,His character arc was so heartbreaking.  Seemed like a decent hard working guy who loved his daughter so much.  He was recovering too so he knew her so well and what she was going through.  When she died he just lost  everything.  All the scenes after that he was just in total shock.  I felt as bad for him as anyone
breakingbad,37sin5,thisishardcore_,3,Mon Jun 1 00:11:33 2015 UTC,No-one redeemed themselves. Although Walt with his delusion probably thought he was going out as a hero and a martyr.
breakingbad,37sin5,onetruepurple,2,Sat May 30 11:58:10 2015 UTC,I don't think he had any more delusions about himself after his stay in New Hampshire.
breakingbad,37sin5,beckerola,1 point,Sun May 31 00:00:18 2015 UTC,"Not really. He was motivated by good intentions originally but then his greed, arrogance, and ego consumed him. There must have been better ways of dealing with his situation than becoming a meth dealer to provide for his family."
breakingbad,37sin5,MadBigMadBoatMan,1 point,Sat May 30 08:29:28 2015 UTC,"Since Breaking Bad is a show that crosses over to the fantasy/superhero genre, the question is a bit strange, but no, he didn't and after episode 1 it was impossible.   How do you redeem yourself from a murder? Turning yourself in and facing your punishment. I don't know any other way."
breakingbad,37sin5,TheJumpingBulldog,1 point,Sun May 31 06:41:12 2015 UTC,"I believe so for in the end he got everything he wanted before the end. He killed all his foes, gave his child a secure future. Finally got closure with Skyler. Sure it wasn't everything he could've hoped for, but I think by then he knew he wasn't going to get out of this either alive or happy. So he chose to die in Hanks words like a man. (Foreshadowing maybe?) To face the terrible world around him and have one last hurrah before he would die. That's why Felina is my favorite episode."
breakingbad,37sin5,SnooSnooCookie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:39:59 2015 UTC,He took it too far. He gave up more and more morsels of any hope of redemption with every unnecessarily illegal or violent act he committed. He was greedy and he paid for it.

breakingbad,37j9uk,Hopontopofus,8,Thu May 28 07:48:47 2015 UTC,"You'd probably think he was a nice and calm neighbour, the type you'd never suspect would hurt a fly, for most of the time (he probably lived like 30? 20? years in that house before he 'broke bad'). When he would then act somewhat strangely, I don't think you'd think much of it. MOST of the time he keeps ""work"" (aka: murder, drugs, extortion etc.) away from ""home"". But you might wonder ""What the heck is going on with Walter!?"" when you see him coming home late again.  But I think Jesse's neighbours are WAY more annoyed. Since he basically looks like an unemployed junkie, and at one point has a party going 24/7 and has actual hobo's living in his house. You think that would go unnoticed? I'd say that is more annoying/noticable than coming and going at all hours.   Idk what kind of a stalky neighbour you are, but I don't keep track of when my neighbours come and go. If they want to leave in the middle of the night, I don't give shits. As long as they don't come home drunk and yelling everyone awake."
breakingbad,37j9uk,ErikEzrin,14,Thu May 28 08:53:33 2015 UTC,maybe the same kind of neighbor who calls the cops on Spaceblanketman when he steals their paper yet still compensates for it

breakingbad,37i57s,gers1978,4,Wed May 27 20:26:25 2015 UTC,"He had become a lot more hardened - inured - to the business and its grisly realities. He'd watched Gus slit a man's throat in front of him, only hours after he'd just shot someone in the face (someone Jesse considered fairly innocent, too). Whereas his words to Walt at the beginning of season three (""I'm the bad guy"") were more of him grasping at an identity in reaction to Jane's death (which he not only took responsibility for, but also the 168 lives aboard the Wayfarer crash), he's now 'officially' a murderer and a bad guy. He's trying to accept it, just as his counselor suggests.  He quickly agrees to killing Gus because he realizes Walter has constructed this new identity for him. He kills people for his so-called partner. This is who he is now. But as we see him make the attempts, he is struggling. Not only because Jesse doesn't really want to be a murderer, but because both Gus and Mike are now treating him with some decency and respect. And while he's still loyal to Walter, we saw just how difficult Walter was making it for Jesse by being a grade A asshole throwing hissyfits because he didn't appreciate being maligned in favor of Jesse rising in the ranks.  Of course, by the end of the episode, we see Jesse begging his NA group to judge and condemn him, and his frustration and anguish is pretty apparent when he doesn't get the damnation he believes he deserves. Eventually, he tries the pragmatic route, and he performs well in Mexico even when shit goes down. He picks a side and its not Walter's."
breakingbad,37i57s,eva_brauns_team,3,Thu May 28 00:05:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Walter should have taken an example in how Gus and Mike handle Jesse. They are manipulating him JUST as much, their appreciation for him isn't genuine. But they understand that appreciation works better with Jesse than beating him down.   Maybe it's because of Walt's teacher-side, that he simply doesn't cut slack for ANYONE not giving their fullest (after all, when a student fucks up a test you don't say ""well done""), and fails to see that appreciation sometimes is a better motivator than playing the tough guy act on someone.   After all, all what Jesse truly wants is someone who appreciates him, who values him, and who truly cares for him. If Walter would have played onto that more, he would have been able to nurture a more healthy relationship between him and Jesse, and thus also manipulate him better and more easily."
breakingbad,37i57s,ErikEzrin,2,Thu May 28 09:04:40 2015 UTC,"I think that's what season five was all about in regards to Walt and Jesse. Walter had learned from Gus how to handle Jesse more appropriately. He was respectful to Jesse, gave him the right encouragement, and look at the results. Jesse stayed clean and started contributing in a big way because of that value placed on him (also, major guilt where Walt was concerned, and so his loyalty was more fierce than ever). Of course, it was all a manipulation, but I do think that Walter cherished that time with Jesse after realizing how much he really needed him. Which was why the sting of Jesse's betrayal hurt so much later (although Walt's betrayal came first).  Yes, Gus was manipulating Jesse and I think Jesse was aware of this (especially after Walt drives the point home - ""No. This is all about ME!""), but it still felt like something positive in his life. And I think that Mike WAS being genuine, after a time. Jesse really came through for him, and for Gus, down in Juarez. I always think of that passing look between Gus and Jesse right after Gus slit Victor's throat. He really did 'see something' in Jesse - someone who could be used effectively on his team if he was motivated in the right way. That doesn't mean that he wasn't completely ready to dispose of Jesse once he realized he was never going to stop being loyal to Walter, but that's Gus for you."
breakingbad,37i57s,eva_brauns_team,3,Thu May 28 13:20:01 2015 UTC,"Eventually he learned, yes. And it COULD all have been fun-n-games (aside from the meth, which is basically poison) IF Todd hadn't shot that kid... sigh  Personally I think it would have been a smart move of Walt (thinking purely pragmatically here) to fake some more grief, and punish Todd for it. Possibly by kicking him out of the operation or killing him (though that might have angered his nazi uncle and his gang...).  I think if Jesse had truly believed that Walt felt TRULY devastated by Drew Sharp's death, he MIGHT have stayed in the business and had believed him when he said ""No more bloodshed"".  I mean, it appearantly is pretty easy for him to fake emotions (see the time he plants the bug in Hank's office), I s'pose on a pragmatical POV it would sometimes have been more beneficial if he had showed (or faked...) some more empathy."
breakingbad,37i57s,ErikEzrin,5,Thu May 28 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"I think if Jesse had truly believed that Walt felt TRULY devastated by Drew Sharp's death, he MIGHT have stayed in the business and had believed him when he said ""No more bloodshed"".   ""You keep saying that and it's BULLSHIT every time!"" Oh  man, I so loved it when Jesse finally got wise to Walt's lies. It was so damn gratifying."
breakingbad,37i57s,eva_brauns_team,2,Thu May 28 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"Yep. Jesse was being played by EVERY FUCKING ONE. Most by Walt, of course, but also by Mike, Gus, even Hank... until the last episode, and he rode out of that gate with no one to tell him what to do, or to 'listen up, for the FIRST time.   I sure hope he moves to Alaska or something, and manages to set up a nice and simple life there, away from all the drugs and violence, and find some peace with himself again.  I think that Walt really WANTED ""no more bloodshed"" though, but that he also KNEW very well that if he wanted to succeed in the meth business (which he did) it would be unavoidable, and thus a 'promise' impossible to keep."
breakingbad,37i57s,ErikEzrin,2,Thu May 28 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"until the last episode, and he rode out of that gate with no one to tell him what to do, or to 'listen up, for the FIRST time.   I loved how Jesse's story ended. I initially thought that Jesse would end up killing Walt, but having him refuse when the opportunity presented itself was so fitting. Him finally getting Walt to admit that it's what Walt wants, and then saying no to doing his dirty work was so satisfying."
breakingbad,37i57s,CrimsonPig,2,Thu May 28 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"Yes indeed. The ending was satisfying in basically every way. It was almost TOO good, but I don't care. It was just PERFECT.  Also seeing Jesse strangle that psych bastard of a Todd to death was just great. And Walt blowing Jack's brains out -mid sentence just like Jack did to Hank-... priceless.  Didn't think I could ever feel so much gratification over a death."
breakingbad,37i57s,ErikEzrin,2,Thu May 28 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"I think that Walt really WANTED ""no more bloodshed"" though   Vince has said that Walter White's ''superpower"" was his ability to lie, but what got him as far as he went was his willingness to lie to himself. Walt was deluded most of the time, especially when it came to ""no more violence"". He used that line before - back in Season One, 'A Crazy Handful of Nothin'. We hear his voice over of that line over a scene where he's walking out of Tuco's exploded lair with blood dripping down his nose. He knew it was unavoidable and him trying to convince Jesse that it would never happen again was Walt treating Jesse like a child. Jesse was no longer addled by drugs and he could see Walt clearly, and he knew damn well that the murders would never stop as long as they stayed in the business. So he elected to leave it. It was an amazing growth for that character. I always think of Jesse's arc as a coming-of-age story. He was a kid at the beginning, but a man by the end. A devastated and haunted, traumatized one, but still his OWN man, and as you say, no longer anyone's tool."
breakingbad,37i57s,eva_brauns_team,1 point,Fri May 29 00:01:15 2015 UTC,"True that, yeah.   When you can lie to yourself, and you BELIEVE it, you can also lie to anyone else incredibly believably, as it doesn't feel like lying anymore. After all, you first deceived yourself into believing your own lie.   He lied to himself, until, I believe, Hank got shot. That was kinda a 'wake up call' for him, in the sense that it made him realize this was not between ""HIM"" and ""THEM"" and he could keep his family out of it all. That the consequences WERE coming indeed, but not just for him, for everyone around him too. When he meets Skylar for the last time, he is honest about how he truly feels for the first time. (ok, given he tells another lie, but that one was necassery to get the money to Walt Jr.)  And I agree on the coming of age story thing. He truly was a 'kid' in the beginning. He also looks and acts a lot more mature. But that makes sense... given what he's been through. Experiences like that age someone quickly."
breakingbad,37i57s,ErikEzrin,2,Fri May 29 06:44:22 2015 UTC,"Imo, I think he agrees that Gus is dangerous and knows he wants them dead. And I also think that at this point in time Jesse is...I cant think of the right word..a lot less innocent then he was at the start. And I dont mean less innocent in a nefarious way but more of an ..experienced way. (I still cant think of the right word) Example: Athough Walt was still far from being full Heisenberg in the 3rd season there is no way that Walt from the pilot would have gotten out of the car and shot the gang member in the head like he did in the 3rd season"

breakingbad,3745az,dimplepinch,29,Sun May 24 18:32:03 2015 UTC,"I wrote this two years ago.  I think we had pretty much the same interpretation of the episode. The only thing I'll add is I think this is the ""point of no return"" for Walt and Heisenberg because the end of the episode is Walt CHOOSING Heisenberg. Once that happens, everything that happens after it becomes inevitable. I've rewatched the series many times and I continue to consider 'Over' my absolute favorite episode.  EDIT - And when I say he chooses to be Heisenberg, it's because it's something he likes, needs, and is good at. He says as much to Skyler in the finale when she asks for a non-bullshit reason for why he did it all.   SKYLER: If I have to hear one more time that you did this for the family-  WALT: I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really...I was alive.   The seeds of that dialogue were planted in 'Over' when Walt tells the mope to stay out of his territory."
breakingbad,3745az,lawofmurphy,7,Sun May 24 20:04:39 2015 UTC,Amen sir. I'm glad people realize the latent significance. And props to you for using the word 'mope'.
breakingbad,3745az,Dr_Toast,2,Sun May 24 20:28:54 2015 UTC,I have always loved this episode and I agree it might be my favorite episode.
breakingbad,3745az,FaerieStories,17,Mon May 25 01:58:05 2015 UTC,"I dislike the way you phrase the distinction between 'Walt' and 'Heisenberg', as if this were a Jekyll and Hyde story. Walt certainly uses the Heisenberg persona as a means of exempting himself from his own guilty conscience (much as his predecessor Macbeth does when he says ""to know my deed, 'twere best not know myself""). The idea of the alter-ego is a manifestation of his need to distance himself from his actions. The audience should do no such distancing, because we know the show is about change, and Walt is character who, roughly speaking, goes from good to evil. There is no 'Heisenberg' - just Walt.  Your comment about the rot is dead right. Imagery of physical rot, decay and disease is used to represent moral and spiritual 'rot' in Shakespearean tragedy, and in psychoanalytical terms, basements have always tended to represent the 'id'."
breakingbad,3745az,OhHiBaf,6,Sun May 24 22:18:01 2015 UTC,"Very good points. I agree, weight should not be put on the audience to make the distinction. However, I'd argue that Walt always had the Heisenberg side to him. It simply required the right set of circumstances, the right reaction to unearth that side. We know this from 506 Buyout in Walt's Empire Business speech. He checks the stock of Gray Matter every week and probably has checked since he took the buyout. Combined with the fracturing of his relationship with Gretchen, his stunted development (doesn't speak to his mother, father died when he was young) and unrealized potential then we can see that the evolution into Scarface was far from a drastic one. I know there is only Walt--but I use the Heisenberg surname only to highlight the most radical of difference. Like 210, like his actions in 312, and pretty much all of Season 5A--these are the most critical IMO junctions where the Heisenberg distinction makes things more clear to analyze."
breakingbad,3745az,Avaricee,3,Sun May 24 22:36:27 2015 UTC,Great analysis!  Posts like this are why I'm still subscribed to this sub.

breakingbad,3745az,zebrahead110,3,Mon May 25 00:08:31 2015 UTC,"I really liked this interpretation a lot, but there were two things that I took issue with a little bit:   I wasn't crazy about the splitting of Walt/Heisenberg.  I felt that throughout the series, Walt might have become the man that he wanted to be - Heisenberg, but that it was still Walt in a literal sense.  He was still the same man in the same skin, it was just an complete change in his personality and demeanor.  I think that acknowledging that a man that was so kind and good could become so evil and cruel is a lot more terrifying then saying that he was becoming someone else...the idea that anyone could be a Heisenberg with the proper motivations and knowledge.  That any of us could turn if we were pushed so far into a corner that we had nothing left to lose.  It's a hard thing to accept, but I think it's one of the things about the show that I absolutely fell in love with.  Everyone has small bits of knowledge that we could do significant amounts of damage with, or make large sums of money with if they were applied in illicit ways, we simply don't because there is no driving factor that pushes us into doing so.  There is no reason to throw our lives away. I had a very different take on the rot.  I didn't think that Walt was going after it because of what happened at the party, I thought that it was because of the cancer.  Even at a party about his cancer being in remission, Walt was well aware that it was still in him somewhere just waiting to strike.  When he saw the rot, he saw himself.  He saw the cancer.  He saw something that was a threat to the foundation of the entire structure.  Maybe Walt's obsessive nature with cleanness was a side effect of his stress over the cancer.  Maybe Walt couldn't fix his own body, but he could sure as hell do whatever needed to be done to fix his own house, to protect his family.  It was his chance to beat the cancer on his own terms.  To rid his body of all of the rot that no one else could be bothered to do - that no one else was able to do (Jr's confusion at why the rot was a big deal and Skyler's complete disinterest in the project entirely)."

breakingbad,37a1pj,Xxxpussyslayer420xxX,7,Tue May 26 02:20:03 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason Walt was written to have jobs that he was extremely overqualified for was because of Walter Jr. - after his exit from Gray Matter and the birth of Walt Jr., Walt was likely pressured to take a job that would allow him to spend time with Junior and allow him to attend to his physical therapy for his cerebral palsy during his early childhood. Walt likely got stuck working these jobs for longer than necessary because of his meek, passive demeanor early in the series."
breakingbad,37a1pj,SquidMan93,5,Tue May 26 06:08:00 2015 UTC,Ability doesn't always mean success.  Walt Jr.'s condition likely rocked Walt's world a bit and limited his career options.  All this after he burned bridges with his ticket to fortune.
breakingbad,37a1pj,xxProjectJxx,3,Tue May 26 14:04:15 2015 UTC,"Jr. probably was a big reason.   BUT WHAT EVERYONE FORGETS  ""The diner was close enough to the lab (mentioned to be Los Alamos) that I could ride my bike to work and stop there for..."" Walt tells the story of how he met Skyler in 104 Cancer Man and mentions having a lab job at Los Alamos (a respected scientific laboratory famous for the Manhattan project research I believe).  AND THEN  The flashback in 313 Full Measure shows a young Walt and Skyler (pregnant) looking into buying their first home. The realtor asks where Walt works he responds ""Sandia Laboratories"" he follows up ""I'm picturing something with lasers.""  FURTHERMORE: There is a deleted scene from 313 that shows Walt and Skyler pulling up in a very expensive convertible.  SO WALT HAD AT LEAST TWO PRO LAB JOBS BEFORE HE BECAME A HS TEACHER likely to 1) be closer to Jr., 2) in 2008 America was in the worst economy since the Great Depression and 3) Walt, a man so rife with stunted development and unrealized potential has a job where he is always the smartest one in the room, where everyone is forced to pay attention to him, a job that inherently boasts the ego--the definition of pedantic.  TLDR: I'm sick of people making it out like Walt went from being a genius at Gray Matter immediately to teaching kids and scrubbing wheel wells with nothing in between. Pay attention to the dialogue, you're missing a whole hell of a lot story."

breakingbad,375v0a,ErikEzrin,5,Mon May 25 10:42:00 2015 UTC,"The thing I couldn't quite get behind was why Gus wanted to keep Walt so badly. Gus was extremely careful and risk averse in business. He built his empire without Walt and already had Gale working for him, who was able to make meth that was more than good enough. Why keep Laurel and Hardy around to keep making things complicated and risky?!"
breakingbad,375v0a,beckerola,5,Mon May 25 12:50:54 2015 UTC,"Well, when Gale learned about the high quality of Walt (and Jesse's) product, he deemed himself to be 'inferior' and urged Gus to hire Walt, or not cook at all. Later he probably refused to cook his own 'substandard product', and wouldn't cook anymore unless he could reach Walt's purity grade.   So that means Gus could either keep Jesse and Walt, which was the easiest option and first, and later, get Gale to learn Walt's secret/recipe, so he could dispose of them as soon as he felt he was 'good enough', which he tried in the end when they became too much of a liability."
breakingbad,375v0a,ErikEzrin,3,Mon May 25 13:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that bothered me too. That with all those eyes and cameras watching Walt cook Gus couldn't figure out how to produce his formula? The first 2-3 cooks maybe, but with so much surveillance it would've been easy to exactly reproduce Walt's methods. It's a recipe, not like Walt is creating something that cannot be replicated like artwork or writing which are imbued with the creator's style but meth cooking is just following steps."

breakingbad,3737zq,falnes,71,Sun May 24 13:25:25 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Todd had some type of developmental disorder.   SPOILERS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER.  Throughout the series, he's always trying to get on people's good side. The first time Walt and Jesse cook in a house, Todd tells Walt about a nannycam hidden in the house, despite specifically being told by Mike to never talk to them unless they talk first.  He also mentions his uncle Jack's prison connections, either to flex a bit, or seem as if he's more useful.  He also has somewhat of a childish crush on Lydia (the way he talks to her, personalized ringtone for her), and is unable to see that their relationship is only business, despite how much he wishes otherwise.  After the white supremacists kidnap Jesse, Todd brings him ice cream, and tries to chat him up, in some kind of attempt to bond or connect with him.  He also never seems to grasp the gravity of the situation. When Walt shows up in the final episode with his Car o' Death and opens up on Jack, Todd and co., Todd crawls to the window, asking Walt what happened. He's completely oblivious to the fact that Walt came to finish things.  I don't think many characters could actually fit the criteria for serious mental disorders, but I feel that Todd fits the bill for something."
breakingbad,3737zq,zero3617,32,Sun May 24 15:38:50 2015 UTC,"I always saw Todd as the inverse of Jesse. Jesse is pretty dumb, is bored by working with Walt, and has a rough exterior overall. But when it comes down to it, he has a good heart and is shown to have a soft spot for kids.   Todd, on the other hand, is bright and eager to learn, but he's the one who has no qualms about murdering a child."
breakingbad,3737zq,vnk,18,Sun May 24 15:55:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I agree that Jesse is ""pretty dumb"".  He has some moments in the show when he says stupid things, but it's almost always in front of Walt, and Walt is always calling him stupid.  Being called dumb by someone who is clearly smart can make people insecure and make them sort of live down to those expectations.  The one instance in the show I can think of off the top of my head when Jesse's actions contradict my assessment is when he leaves the keys in the ignition all weekend while they're having their marathon session.  That was stupid.  But most other instances that Walt appeals to when he called Jesse stupid are really more instances of his being poorly educated, unrefined, and having a drug habit IMO.  None of which are necessarily indicative of stupidity (in the sense of having a low IQ).  Totally agree with your assessment of their morals.  I believe Jesse is arguably the most moral character on the show.  You could convincingly argue for Hank as well, but as the series progresses into the final episodes we see that Hank is really as ruthless as any character on the show, he's just fighting for the law rather than against it.  To support this statement, I point to Hank's lack of concern that Jesse might be killed in the pursuit of Walt.  Somehow I feel that, if the shoe were on the other foot, Jesse wouldn't want Hank to get killed, where Hank clearly doesn't care about what happens to Jesse.  I would say Jesse's ugliest (moral ugliness, i.e., most hateful) moment is when after he gets beat up and wakes up in the hospital in season 2 and talks about how he's going to sue his attacker into oblivion.  And who was his attacker?  Oh yeah, it was Hank.  Not to mention Hank's treatment of Marie when he was paralyzed, which was repugnant.  When push comes to shove and things get bad, I feel like Jesse is the one character who might be capable of putting others before himself.  I'm not a psychologist (cue eye rolling from all real psychologists), but I would hazard a guess that Todd is a psychopath.  He clearly doesn't feel bad about anything, even if he hurts or kills innocent people.  In a show that's filled with evil people - Tuco, Gus, Jack, Walt - Todd, to me, is as bad as any of them.  Not necessarily because of things he actually did (although killing Drew Sharp is in contention for most heinous single crime in the series), but because of the things I think he would do if he thought he could benefit from them and get away with them.  EDIT: Added a sentence."
breakingbad,3737zq,jcdavis5,10,Sun May 24 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"That's a really great observation. I hadn't thought of that, but it makes tons of sense. Especially the part with kids.

Jesse was always against kids being hurt or brought into the business, whereas Todd would put a bullet in one without a moment's hesitation."

breakingbad,3737zq,braddamit,6,Sun May 24 16:08:11 2015 UTC,"I almost used that phrase in my post, since it's what originally got me thinking that Todd had some kind of disorder.  He definitely shows no emotion in the show, and perhaps some kind of autism spectrum thing is the reason behind it. Don't know enough about it to say for sure, but the problem with emotional relation is a symptom, as I understand it.  He's always cold and with flat-affect, which has to be a sign of somthing. Even that psycho Jack showed more hints of emotion than Todd."
breakingbad,3737zq,zero3617,8,Sun May 24 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think autism, but emotional retardation.

It's interesting, however, how differently the all act on it.  ""Hank"" types try to make up for their lack of self worth by portraying a tough outward exterior, being brash, brazen and loud-mouthed.   ""Marie"" types act as if they are entitled, as if they are rich or famous, etc. And always want everything to be about them. People generally perceive Maries as pretentious bitches.  ""Walt"" types seem totally okay on the outside, and do the exact opposite from the Hank and Marie types, instead of putting themselves forward they render themselves invisible. But deep down, they are a boiling kettle, with no means to release pressure. They might blow at any time when the pressure inside gets too high, and god forbid what happens then...  I can easily point multiple ""Hanks"", ""Maries"" and ""Walts"" in my life. The Hanks and Maries are definitely the most annoying, but the Walts have the highest potential to become dangerous if they don't find an outlet for their feelings.  Neither of the three are ""bad"" or ""evil"" people, but all three ARE inwardly damaged people trying to find a way to handle that, and still live their lives."
breakingbad,3737zq,ErikEzrin,18,Sun May 24 14:10:53 2015 UTC,"I like your answer.  I'm surprised no one mentioned Tuco, Hector, and ""the cousins"" Leonel and Marco Salamanca, Todd..."
breakingbad,3737zq,tinkerer13,11,Sun May 24 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks :)  And yeah, they are interesting cases as well. Don't think there is any character in Breaking Bad which you couldn't write an essay about. They are harder to dissect though, as we don't get half as much insight in their inner workings and life as we get of the main characters.   I thought the scene where Hector tries to drown one of the cousins is very telling. Signifies they might not always have been so cold and creepy, but maybe were made that way by their uncle?  As for Todd, he's easy. He's a psycho. I doubt if he even has any feeling inside, except for rational things like ""respect"" and ""like"" or ""dislike"". He knows what is deemed 'normal' and desirable behaviour to some extent, and adopted that to make his relationships with other people work better, but I doubt he even knows right from wrong."
breakingbad,3737zq,ErikEzrin,4,Sun May 24 16:06:41 2015 UTC,Hank has severe performance anxiety and PTSD issues as well.
breakingbad,3737zq,buywhizzobutter,6,Sun May 24 21:07:17 2015 UTC,Yeah true.  But did he already have the PTSD issues at the pilot? Think they were caused mainly by the 'tortuga' explosion.

Maybe that's why regardless of everything he did I could connect with him so well. At my most depressed (and repressed) moment my biggest dream was not only to rise above the underestimated image that people had of me, but also to get vengeance on those who had hurt me in the past.   Even though I grew past that now, and am fairly happy, I never saw this feeling as a bad thing, as it was what they'd deserve. It's just since Breaking Bad that I have seen and realise the flip side of this coin, and that even though I was the underdog, desires for revenge are never heroic or healthy to nurture."

If the reduction is not stereo specific how can the product be enantiomerically pure?. And whats with the blue?.   Well when you finish cooking a batch, all the meth is in two forms in the giant vat but it is impossible to separate them, they have all the same properties and solubility even though only 50% of the drug is the pure meth that gets you high, the other 50% is L-meth which is sold as benzedrex inhalers.   So walter ""resolves"" these isomers is using something mentioned on the show called ""X-ray crystallography"" I won't pretend to understand how that can seperate D L meth from each other but it's nothing too fancy.  I believe he uses this method as well as the blue dye to separate the pure 99.9% D-meth from the L-meth.. even though it shouldn't change the effects or high, just makes it more technically ""pure"".. the only impurity being the blue dye used to separate the isomers.   Every child should know this."
breakingbad,36zsn9,ErikEzrin,2,Sat May 23 21:57:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting theory, but I really don't think he used blue dye, like seriously. A dye would not chemically interact with any of the elements in the substance, it would only add a colour, another impurity.  Actually the purest meth is entirely colourless, almost glass-like. There is no known method which uses blue colouring to separate D meth from L meth. Just use google if you don't believe me."

breakingbad,36zfin,_fidel_castro_,28,Sat May 23 12:50:47 2015 UTC,"I posted something similar about this a bit earlier (though I wasn't asking how difficult it was). Basically it is EXTREMELY easy to make very low quality (50% pure) meth, but to make it high quality, 95% pure and up, it's a very complex process.  There are also lots of dangerous, toxic and explosive chemicals used in the production process, so it's not in the least dangerous. ('home' meth labs regularly blow up, and the 'home' cooks often suffer from health problems due to inhalation and contact with the chemicals)  As for how important it is for regular users, I cannot answer that for you, as I have never used meth nor know anyone who does. One part speaking in favour of Walter is that a higher purity also means less unwanted other gunk which most likely is bad for one's health (not like meth is healthy, y'know, but any drug in it's pure form is essentially more addictive but less toxic than adulterated), also, the effect would be stronger.  However, I read an article about this matter a while ago, where a drug dealer states ""If it's good, people buy. If it's bad, people buy more."" and basically stated that in a real life situation Walt WOULD get more cash for his stuff (as it's more pure, so he essentially sells MORE meth for the same weight), but that any sensible dealer would adulterate it with other stuff because then they'd make a bigger profit, and thus the impact of 'blue sky' on the streets wouldn't even be noticeable."
breakingbad,36zfin,ErikEzrin,2,Sat May 23 14:50:15 2015 UTC,Getting 95% up is easy as well. But you will throw away loads of methamphetamine in the process of concentrating it up.  The thing most people actually want is high purities at high yields.
breakingbad,36zfin,nbsdfk,1 point,Sun May 24 04:50:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, okay, but I think it speaks for itself that having to throw away loads of methamphetamine to get a high purity totally defeats the purpose of trying to get that high purity, as everything in the drug business is about money.  I'm pretty sure the method in BrBa has both a high purity and high yield, otherwise they'd never do it that way."

breakingbad,36zfin,nbsdfk,3,Sun May 24 12:58:54 2015 UTC,"That helps a lot of course. I have studied biology for a while, and we did a fair share of chemical experiments, and even the slightest change in certain parameters (time, temperature, volumes of liquids, weight of substances used, etc.) can potentially change the entire outcome of the experiment. Science is seriously precise business!"

(if you've never tried it before, DON'T START. I saw too many lives get ruined by that stuff)  I guarantee that if we had found somebody reliable with Walt's quality, we would have paid more and NEVER bought from anybody else. Absolutely guaranteed.   The hunt was the worst, because most meth dealers were also users and notoriously unreliable. It would take hours, days, maybe weeks to track down some friend of a friend of a friend. And then all they'd have is crap, but you had no choice because there weren't any other options. The whole process really sucked.  The good stuff was obvious. You'd know as soon as you tried it. It would hit you right away, and you'd hardly need any of it to be happy for hours. The high felt more pure because there wasn't a bunch of other crap in there. I don't want to go into any more detail because I don't want anybody to think it's worth trying.  The good stuff actually did look kind of like Walt's, but not blue. Usually looked like crystals, semi-transparent, kind of wet. I remember some being pink, but mostly milky white or clear. The bad stuff was almost always dry powder and usually a dirty off-white color (shades of yellow, brown, etc depending on what it was cut with). Sometimes it would just taste horrible and require a lot more than the good stuff."

breakingbad,36zfin,the_hd_easter,1 point,Sat May 23 18:02:06 2015 UTC,"Extreme high purity of any chemical requires very detailed knowledge of every stereoisomer of every intermediate betwewn raw material and product. Sourcing or making the required starting material is difficult to begin with. Contamination is a mahor issue whether from water vapor or even oxygen exposure in some cases, which is when a hood and a tank of dry nitrogen comes in handy. The labratory equipment is expensive and often times distribution of them is controlled by government agencies. Now after that you need to know molar proportions for everything to minimize waste and unreacted intermediates. Finally washing the final product is required to remove any impurities. After all that you have to vacuum dry your chemical to remove the solvent.  TL; DR It's hard as fuck to make any chemical in high purity without inimate knowledge of oganic chemistry and good equipment/protocols."

If you know your byproducts it's very easy!  And even if not, just distill under vacuum!   It's only getting problematic once you try to reach analytic purity levels or want to actually make money with it.

And if you use phosphorus and iodine and a strong acid, you are bound to create a reductive milieu. To end up with a ketone from the alcohol you'd need something like chrome oxides or potassium permanganate.

The leaves are chewed for a euphoric/stimulant high. Cathinone is to Methcathinone as Amphetamine is the methamphetamine. Methcathinone is chemically much easier to synthesize from psuedoephedrine than methamphetamine, and apparently it can be done by the most amateur of chemists. Methcathinone has very similar effects as methamphetamine."

""Los Pollos Hermanos"" means these guys are chickens, and they're siblings.  Now, according to the thread you linked:   ""Los pollos hermanos"" means litherally ""the brother chickens"" as in chickens who are sons of the same parent(s)   This is not 100% true. ""Los pollos hermanos"" can mean ""The brother chickens"" but it can also mean ""The chicken brothers"".

breakingbad,36kk47,ErikEzrin,4,Wed May 20 07:19:38 2015 UTC,"First three. Those are more or less conclusive, almost a mini-film on it's own, and the moment that Krazy-8 got killed really sucked me in. Plus, it ends with a big cliffhanger (""Skylar, I need to tell you something"" cut to black)  If they are still not convinced... or you want to jump right in, I'd say... episode 1 and 6 (""crazy handful of nothin'"") though the punch of 6 also came for me through the buildup, and I don't think it's a good idea to ruin that for someone."

breakingbad,36kk47,fyl69,0,Mon Jun 1 09:01:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can pick and choose. The awesomeness of BB was the building and knowing who the characters. I actually hated it for the first 4-5 episodes...but I forced myself to watch them. (believe it or not, I didn't see BB at alll until a year after the series ended - never picked up any spoilers either!) learned to love the series. I'd binge watch them 4-5 at a time.   If I had to pick a single episode, I like the one where the ""I am the one who knocks"" line came from. It shows Walter has changed and is now Heizenburg. But without seeing Walter in his saggy whitie tighties in the first few episodes you can't appreciate who he has become."
breakingbad,36k2kl,matt4787,18,Tue May 19 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"I would have liked to see the falling out more so by Walter White's greed and wanting to be the leader of his Empire.    This is something I hear a lot. Especially since Mike accused Walt of ruining his relationship with Fring ""because of your pride and your ego."" What he, and everyone else, forgets is that for Walt to save his relationship with Fring, he would have had to sacrifice Jesse. Fring was never going to let him keep working with a junkie, and Jesse was never going to let the bullet heads who killed Andrea's brother live, let alone work with them.  Gus may not have known about the children, but if he didn't know, it's because he didn't want to know. As the boss, he's answerable for what his men did. This is also why it doesn't matter if he actually ordered the boy to be killed or not. It wouldn't have happened if his own people thought he'd object.   So that was Fring's fault. His other big mistake was misjudging the relationship between Walt and Jesse. It wasn't hatred or greed or a desire to ""be the Man"" that drove Walt to run those people over with his car...   It was love. Unconditional love, which is really the most terrifying thing in the world. Hate you can deal with: just kill the person you hate, bask in the glow of being the winner, and then forget all about it. It's bad if Heisenberg hates you... but if he loves you, then you are REALLY fucked because he will not let you go, no matter how bad it is or how much it hurts. That's why he basically kept Skyler a hostage in her own house and wouldn't let his children be away from him. It's how his relationship with Hank got so twisted. He could not let go. And he was the last person in the world to realize what a monster that made him.   Hate is bad, but Love is much worse."

Gus didn't like how out of control walter was. he liked gale because he could control Gale. Gus does forgive walt and jesse by not killing them, he made a business decision to keep the meth flowing. then he tries to separate them to minimize Walt and get Jesse on his side."
breakingbad,36jlnv,dimplepinch,2,Tue May 19 21:30:07 2015 UTC,That 'payback' got them in major trouble though...
breakingbad,36jlnv,ErikEzrin,3,Wed May 20 07:15:58 2015 UTC,"Oh clearly, there's no doubting that. My point was that in episode 211, right after the profound ""Stay out of my territory"" scene--when Walt hasn't met Gus Fring yet--he is seeing as Heisenberg. He plans out his empire with Saul and Jesse at this meeting in 211 ""We need enforcers, on a street level that are rock solid...payback that's what we need.""  Then flash forward to 312 merely a few months after Combo's death, Walt has lost his family and found his way into millions but by agreeing to be under the thumb of Gus. To ""know his place and shut his mouth"" up until, of course that ""Run"" moment."
breakingbad,36jlnv,ErikEzrin,2,Wed May 20 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah truth. But he was right in both cases...  First time, they had to get 'payback', as at the time they were small fish in a big pond, if they had let themselves get ripped off, more people would refuse to pay and steal their stuff because they knew they could get away with it.  In the latter case, they were working under Gus and not responsible for destribution anymore. They were now working under someone far more powerful who'd get 'payback' on THEM if they would harm his dealers (which he eventually did, and made everything escalate into a big shitpool of hellfire)  So yeah... I get why Jesse wanted revenge, I mean, they shot Combo and then killed a kid, that would upset me more than a couple pounds of stolen meth, but Walt WAS definitely right by saying it was... well... very unwise."
breakingbad,36jlnv,Bottlecap_Prophet,2,Wed May 20 22:12:25 2015 UTC,"Well of course. I'm not disputing that he was right. Just how quickly Walt was ready to submit to Gus as his higher power. Even in the literally cutthroat criminal game Walt found a way to suppress Heisenberg and again was under the thumb of a boss. ""Who's in control till then? Me. That's how I live my life"" from 408 and that's the irony. For someone as stunted and who ""likes it and is good at it"" it's interesting how even while making millions Walt must eventually be in control."

An appropriate response sounds like he's either going to kill Walt, or come close. Something to fix the Walt problem. Maybe he just didn't have a chance to get the ball rolling, since he suddenly misplaced some of his skin in the nursing home. Maybe I missed something within the last 2 episodes that tells us what he was going to do"
breakingbad,36l5z5,Riosa3,1 point,Thu May 21 04:32:29 2015 UTC,"I just rewatched them and there's no particular hint at that, so yeah, he probably would have gotten the ball rolling but didn't because, as you said, he lost a little bit of his skin there. It was probably only included as Brock misdirection but it still makes sense plot-wise from that angle."
breakingbad,36iar3,taylortob,1 point,Tue May 19 16:24:23 2015 UTC,I just love how Captain Ahab-like Walt was in the episode.  His spear being a makeshift fly swatter and Jesse playing Starbuck.
breakingbad,36l7hc,naaate129,15,Wed May 20 05:10:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know... it's sure not mentioned anywhere, but I don't think it'd be something Walt would do. It just seems out of character for him.  So far as I know, the only drugs he uses are alcohol, one joint (at Jesse's place) and ""drugs"" as in his medication.  Rule No. 1 of being a drug dealer/maker: ""Don't get high on your own supply""  Walt got this. Jesse, not so much."

breakingbad,36l7hc,thisishardcore_,5,Fri May 22 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think there are theories and speculation. I've seen on this sub before that he may have bumped during 'The Fly.' Something about him being fixated on one thing and having chest pain because he was on uppers and downers, my memory is hazy. So yeah, I don't think there is any hard evidence."
breakingbad,36l7hc,DrGaren,4,Wed May 20 05:36:28 2015 UTC,That would make sense. I still don't believe it though. I think The Fly was just showing how much he wanted to make the best product.
breakingbad,36l7hc,xxProjectJxx,6,Wed May 20 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"I think Fly was less about wanting to make the best product, and more about the stress he was under at the time.  The guilt over Jane, Hank being injured, his family, his feeling that he's lived too long, let things get too out of hand, he says this directly.  All of this is coming to a head, and it kinda drives him a little nuts.  Well, that and budget constraints."
breakingbad,36l7hc,chaspooley,6,Wed May 20 18:48:43 2015 UTC,"Remember that in Fly we see his cancer coming back.  Not overtly stated, but hinted at by Jesse and confirmed later in the show.  Like Jesse's Aunt, we see how Walt's disease is making him paranoid and tough to be around and very obsessive.  If you have ever been around an elder person who has cancer or is sick... you will see a bit of obsessiveness in their demeanor.  Or at least that was my experience with my buddies father."

breakingbad,36hcxr,thisishardcore_,9,Tue May 19 12:03:19 2015 UTC,"I heard about it for the first time 'round 2010 I think, but all seasons aired a bit later here because I live in Europe.  I am pretty damn late to the party myself. I just finished watching about a month ago. I remember one of my friends explaining the story to me, about a chemistry teacher who gets cancer, has a DEA brother in law, starts cooking meth, etc. and thinking ""Meh, doesn't sound like my thing.""  Then slowly the buzz started to increase, all over the web, everywhere, and for a while EVERYONE seemed to be watching Breaking Bad. I didn't.   Then two years after it ended, I found myself with some spare time, and I decided to 'check if it's really THAT good as everyone claims', and I was hooked from the first episode on, only starting to love the show more with every episode. But it's just since I finished the entire series and look back upon it that I truly realize what a masterpiece it was, and still is."

breakingbad,36hcxr,Cacanny,1 point,Thu May 21 10:16:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is. Mainly because I had this feeling with a number of shows, and turned out to be HORRIBLY wrong each and every time, I now don't judge a series on such a basis anymore, and generally dislike it when others do so.  I mean, I got tons of friends who just refuse to watch BrBa because of the same reasons I didn't watch it. Even when I tell them ""I was the same, I had exactly the same outlook, but HELL! How wrong I was!"" they still aren't convinced.  I'd love to watch the Wire, though I cannot find it anywhere in good quality on the internet. It's not on popcorn time anyway...   Same applies to the Sopranos. Since it has often been compared to BrBa and appearantly also is a great show, I have decided I want to watch it as well, but it seems to have vanished off the web :c"

breakingbad,36ayfk,ErikEzrin,5,Mon May 18 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"And then people say Walt is a natural liar! He actually had to LEARN it, lol. As for real, in the first seasons he's a terrible liar. He doesn't yet realize a best lie = the closest to the truth possible, and also is totally blind of the cues that people aren't buying it.

breakingbad,36ayfk,Snore00,11,Mon May 18 14:27:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Hank only knows Walt as his pathetic brother-in-law. It's much more plausible that someone stole those things from him rather then him do it himself. It just seems obvious because we know the truth."
breakingbad,36ayfk,ErikEzrin,4,Mon May 18 16:01:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah true, everyone -Hank even more than others, Skylar the least- probably had a blind-spot for what Walt would be capable of. Because, seriously, he's like the prime example of a person people would assume 'could never hurt a fly' (how wrong they were...)  But nonetheless he simply COULDN'T lie well. He'd just pull a different face than normal and tries to sound more 'innocent', idk how to explain, but when people do that around me irl I'm like ""I'm sniffin' a lie!""  But in the end, he had gotten SO GOOD at it that even the audience isn't entirely sure anymore when he's lying and when he's not.

breakingbad,36ayfk,ErikEzrin,2,Mon May 18 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah! Haha :P  Though I don't think I need to explain it wasn't his desire to 'hurt a fly', but to get rid of a 'pathogen' (I mean, wtf. Who ever thinks about the inner life of flies? I consider myself a good person, and I swat them without feelings of remorse, lol), though it so clearly signifies how obsessed and almost 'delusional' in some way, Walt has become.

breakingbad,368kzg,l00pee,23,Sun May 17 14:55:55 2015 UTC,It was Cusack and Matthew Broderick. And I believe they were both suggested by Sony and or AMC. Vince always had Bryan in mind.
breakingbad,368kzg,der1x,17,Sun May 17 15:43:03 2015 UTC,Eww...I can't imagine the show being as successful as it is with either of them playing Heisenberg.
breakingbad,368kzg,ParadoxN0W,14,Sun May 17 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"No where near as successful. Granted, they are both good actors in their own right but they are no where near Cranston."
breakingbad,368kzg,MrMcKilla91,17,Sun May 17 16:00:14 2015 UTC,"I remember hearing Cusack was being thrown around for the role of Walter and it always confused me. Cusack is a great actor, but I think great in a totally different way than Bryan is a great actor. Season one with the bumbling Chemistry teacher trying to make meth would have been alright with Cusack, but I don't think the later seasons would be even close to where they were without Bryan.   Then again. One of Bryan's  biggest known roles before that was playing a goofy ass dad on Malcolm In The Middle."
breakingbad,368kzg,ErikEzrin,8,Sun May 17 19:51:55 2015 UTC,"Especially Matthew Broderick. That guy is such a whiny pussy, I can't imagine him playing Heisenberg."
breakingbad,368kzg,NiggyPop,6,Sun May 17 17:34:30 2015 UTC,What do they all have in common?   White guy squinty eyes.
breakingbad,368kzg,ErikEzrin,26,Sun May 17 19:45:11 2015 UTC,I'd say Bryan Cranston is a better actor than John Cusack times ten.
breakingbad,368kzg,synth22,6,Sun May 17 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"John Cusack, however, has a lot more experience and it's hard to imagine the series without Cranston, but we'll never know if Cusack could have pulled it off."
breakingbad,368kzg,ErikEzrin,4,Sun May 17 17:49:29 2015 UTC,I agree
breakingbad,368kzg,ErikEzrin,3,Sun May 17 15:28:01 2015 UTC,"he also wanted matthew broderick for the role, which i think wouldve sucked. i cant see ferris bueller doing the ""i am the one who knocks"" scene in his mousy voice"
breakingbad,368kzg,drunk_kronk,2,Sun May 17 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know (also forgot the other dude's name though), but just imagine John Crusack or that other guy playing Walt rather than Bryan Cranston.   It just... doesn't compute. Bryan is just goddamn PERFECT for the role! I can't even imagine Walter with another face."
breakingbad,368kzg,prakashdanish,28,Sun May 17 15:27:40 2015 UTC,"That's because you've already seen and are familiar with the performance. If you had heard of the role going to someone else back when the show first aired, you wouldn't be thinking the same way, and who knows, the alternative could have been just as good. I personally only saw Bryan Cranston in a handful of episodes of Malcolm in the Middle, and when I first saw Breaking Bad, my initial thought was ""why is the dad from Malcolm in the Middle in a drama about drugs?"" Watched a bit more, and was blown away by his performance with the gradual character development in Walter White.  Now, put someone else in that same position, like John Cusack, and who knows how good or bad he would have been able to pull it off, or what sort of alternative perspective on the character we might have seen as a result.  It's like... you can't imagine anyone else in the role, but try to remember back when there was no one to imagine for the role in the first place? I hated... HATED the idea of Heath Ledger as the Joker. But holy shit did he deliver.  Now just imagine a shaved John Cusack in a pork pie hat."
breakingbad,368kzg,roxvox,3,Sun May 17 15:34:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm true. I think John Cusack can definitely both portray the sympathetic and dark side of Walt, but he just feels too young to me.   But hey, I guess it was meant to be that Cranston got this role. Usually I don't believe in fate, but this is such a fucking coincidence, and he delivers SO well... I almost start to believe there is such a thing."
breakingbad,368kzg,prezuiwf,9,Sun May 17 20:16:12 2015 UTC,I think Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Williams are the only two other actors that would have made a great Walter White.
breakingbad,368kzg,roxvox,3,Sun May 17 15:49:12 2015 UTC,"Hmmm yeaah I think those could do it. I can at least envision them as Walt better than all other actors (aside from Bryan Cranston). They are both sympathetic, but great actors and able to play more dark and dramatic roles. Also, it would work with their face I think.  Sad they are both dead, they were two of my favourite actors..."
breakingbad,368kzg,prezuiwf,3,Sun May 17 20:11:39 2015 UTC,I thought nobody other than Anthony Hopkins would be able to pull off Hannibal so well... and then I saw the TV series.

And why did they insult our intelligence implying that the money thing with Gretchen and Elliot would go down easily. That scene was so embarrasing, like Skyler and Walt Jr would just take that money, not suspect it was from Walt all along....  And why did they set up the whole show to make us think Walt would really lose a lot, when all he lost was Hank? I thought things would go to hell for real in the finale, but everything sorted out quite nicely."

All he lost was Hank? That was simply the catalyst. By the end of Felina, his immediate family hates him, almost 90% of his fortune was stolen from him BY the crew that took out Hank (insult to injury), anyone that knew him will have all their memories of him tainted, his daughter will grow up not without a father, but instead with only the stories people tell of him with disgust, opposite Walt's relation to his father. And Walt's surrogate son Jesse is permanently scarred both in mind and body. What didn't Walt lose? That's my question.

It's just that at some times, i felt like Hank and Jesse were also protagonists, and the ending kind of reminds you that no, it was always all about Walt. And that's ok. The ambiguety of it all kind of bothered me at first, but now i'm looking it in a whole new light. I would have liked Hank's death to be a little more epic, anyway. For me, it didn't feel that fulfilling of a moment, at least at first sight. And after that, we learnt very little about how Marie was herself, not just how she were with Skyler and her children."

breakingbad,365l8a,MisterCanada,125,Sat May 16 18:38:31 2015 UTC,"Skylar is easy, that would be: ""For us, what's one more?""  When it comes to Walt, oddly enough, for me the worst things weren't even the acts he committed (poisoning of Brock and Jane's death are high on that list), but more the constant manipulation and lies. Especially the frightening EASE with which he manipulates people around him towards the end of the series (props to Cranston's acting on that, as in the first few seasons he honestly was a TERRIBLE liar, like outright terrible, and in the end he just spews out so many lies even we don't know for sure when he's lying or telling the ruth anymore)  Though the prison killings and handing Jesse over to Jack were definitely one of his most terrible acts IMO.  Jesse is good at fucking stuff up because he doesn't think things through or doesn't pay attention (like the 'bathtub accident' in the second episode, or nearly getting himself killed when going out to take revenge on Combo's killers), but he doesn't really manipulate people in doing what he wants like Walt does.  However if I were to list his worst act, I'd say, just going to the rehab group to sell those former addicts meth, and pushing some of his stuff onto an innocent, unsuspecting girl (at the gas station)."

Jesse: I would say killing Gale, but he didn't want to do it, he only did it to save Walt's life and basically had no choice. Also, it completely destroyed him. So honestly, maybe trying to sell meth to the people in the N.A. meetings. He had no reason to do it, he had plenty of money. It was just a really shitty and amoral thing to do.

The 'I need money for my family' thing gave Walt justification to do what he did (which he needed when he just started. And he needed HIMSELF to believe it), but actually all he ever wanted was to feel ALIVE.  If he had just followed his true dream from the start, didn't let other people screw him over, humiliate them, and shred his ego to pieces, he wouldn't have the need to feel 'alive', as he already did.  Also wouldn't he have fallen prey to egoism like he did now, as quite frankly... the most egoistical people, are the ones with the most damaged egos. Since when you are genuinely confident, you don't need to constantly stroke your own ego to feel 'good'.

First of all, initially he didn't even WANT to get chemo, and still he wanted to cook meth, to leave money for his family.  Secondly, money wasn't truly the thing that drove him, it was an excuse, a smokescreen to justify his actions. The true reason why he did all of it was because he felt beaten down and dead on the inside, and wanted to feel powerful and mostly ALIVE for once in his life.

All his choices are being made FOR him, and other people constantly assume he's not capable of anything.

breakingbad,365l8a,ErikEzrin,12,Sat May 16 22:23:55 2015 UTC,"walt made meth cause he wanted to leave money for his family   This was basically the stance that I had on Walt's actions up until the 5 or 6 final episodes.  When he started to go on about how betrayed and insignificant he felt about leaving Greymatter at exactly the wrong moment, it seemed to indicate that it was like he was trying to makeup for the life that him and his family could have had, had he done things differently...had he made better choices.  Just look at when he bought himself and Walt Jr. brand new fancy cars.  How upset he was when Skyler disapproved of it.  He felt that she was sabotaging the life that Walt wanted to give them - that he could have given to them.  The opulence that he felt he was owed.  It was like he was finally getting the money that he felt he deserved for his brilliance, but had never gotten as ""just"" a Chemistry teacher.  He finally had the opportunity to put his training and skills to use in a way that made him massive amounts of money.  It was everything that he wanted, everything that he yearned for all of those years ago.  It wasn't just that he wanted his family to be okay, it was that he wanted to feel that sense of accomplishment, that recognition that he was so close to but never quiet was able to reach out and grab.  He wanted to use all of the knowledge that he had gained and put it into something that would earn him fame and fortune.  Of course, he would always feel like he was coming up short changed, since  he was surrounded by people that he felt were intellectually inferior to him and just filthy degenerates.  Short-sighted, lazy people who couldn't see the big picture.  People who couldn't see the massive opportunities that were there for the taking.  He thought that people viewed what he was doing as ""just"" making drugs, when he viewed it as so much more: a craft, an art.  A science.  That is why he showed such a passion for preciseness and cleanliness - a cook cobbles meth together in filthy conditions, a Chemist works in a sterile work space.  IMO, it was as much about lost dreams and personal pride that drove him to do what he did as anything else."

breakingbad,365l8a,tkeiy714,24,Sat May 16 15:02:08 2015 UTC,It was kill or be killed. Walt needed Gale to die otherwise Mike and Victor would have killed him right there.

breakingbad,365l8a,Soaring_Seagull24,0,Sat May 16 20:14:47 2015 UTC,But it still remains that the only person who was playing it straight (as straight as meth making goes) was gale.

breakingbad,365l8a,AnneFrankenstein,1 point,Sat May 16 21:02:28 2015 UTC,Disagree. Gale condoned everything that guy and Walter did by cooking meth. He is as complicit in all of the bad things as anyone else. Just because he never pulled a trigger he still was involved in it all.

breakingbad,365l8a,PHDTPHD,4,Sat May 16 21:46:17 2015 UTC,I disagree.  Jane had to go.  She was a rueful and selfish heroin user.  Any one who has ever dealt with a heroin user knows they can never ever be trusted again.  While Jesse used he wasn't fully an addict to that heinous drug.  Jane had to go one way or the other.

Early on, as in the first three seasons, they always had a choice, like a fork in the road: do the right thing or break bad. It seemed like they always made the wrong choice to push the inevitable out further, eventually coming back harder. I think Walt letting Jane die was probably the harshest example of making the wrong decision. This single event changed Jesse forever from what I saw as a selfish standpoint from Walt: he didn't want to lose Jesse. All of Walt's actions were selfish, this being the most evil. I believe Jesse could have gotten out right then, end of story."

I also recommend a show called Dexter, which is surprisingly also on Netflix, I found it quite a nice little thing to watch after finishing BB."

breakingbad,3653ef,PorshiaPortiahPortia,2,Sat May 16 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"Very interesting observation. And that line once again shows that Skylar is not as stupid as people think.  The first time I saw it, I actually did see it like how Walt WANTS us to see it: him trying to do something 'nice' for his son. But in retrospect I think it was a majorily impulsive act of ego-stroking on his own behalf.  I don't think he even THOUGHT of the possible implications of buying that car, both the unbelievability of being able to afford it, and the way it would set up his son against Skylar. I don't think he deliberately wanted to make Skylar appear to be the 'bitch mom' (though ultimately, he did), but rather just wanted to feel ""badass"" and ""awesome"" (ego stroke, ego stroke), and that was all he was thinking about. Himself, and his (wounded) ego."

breakingbad,3653ef,thisishardcore_,1 point,Sat May 16 22:06:34 2015 UTC,"This was a clever way for the writers to get in all the Skyler hate. By actually setting up a scenario where the outside world (the viewers) who only seem to care about half the story (Walt being a badass and a cool dad) view Skyler as ""a bitch"" basically airing the Skyler hate while also saying there is more to the story.  You have to remember, the cover for buying the car wasn't just ""oh what are the neighbors gonna think?"" or 'What will we tell Hank and Marie."" Skyler is thoroughly established as being hyper focused on the TAX side of things. They couldn't justify it in an audit so I think that's Skyler's beef here."

Other insights from Gilligan: Skyler was pregnant from the get go to pour on the sympathy for Walt, Brock is being taken care of by his abuela, only regret is Jesse's teeth, and only fan influence on him was Kevin (sadly passed away) who reminded him of the Elliots."

Though, that might be wrong, I may need to go back and check the episode, but, yeah.  If I'm wrong, the only other plausible theory I could give is well, I don't know - he's looking for mics and cameras right?

breakingbad,360oas,PaperNoire,1 point,Fri May 15 07:11:29 2015 UTC,"In the episode, it shows tyrus doing the first sweep and walt standing outside the window, and the next scene it cuts to walt running to his car. It's unlikely that he ran back after that to put the bomb in because tyrus would be on the look out, so either tyrus missed it the first (and second) time or walt went back in after standing outside on the window and put the bomb in place then (off camera)."
breakingbad,360oas,ChickenBrick,1 point,Sun May 17 06:09:04 2015 UTC,To be fair he is looking for bugs not bombs. Maybe hector shit himself to keep him away
breakingbad,361guj,MadBigMadBoatMan,4,Fri May 15 08:21:24 2015 UTC,"The point of Walter's meth is that it's the best available, so they can charge significantly more for it. This would mean any way of seeking higher quality (getting more pure meth, refusing to cut it) is a profitable business decision.  Otherwise, I generally think that Gus was one of the better and more interesting characters in the show -- he acts logically, which allows for the cat-and-mouse between him and Walter, but also has a compelling personal element (namely his history with the cartel) which makes him whole. I agree with this characterization more than say, season 1-2 Skyler or Jane after finding out about the money, because the style then seemed to be ""make Walt the good guy and make everyone against him or questioning him plainly unlikable""."
breakingbad,361guj,tchutchu,4,Fri May 15 09:40:33 2015 UTC,"Before Saul was introduced, Hank was used sometimes as sort of a comic relief character. Especially in Season 1, he often came off as loud, boisterous, but funny. Saul was a way to allow for comic relief from time to time within the show, and allowing for Hank to grow as a character.  Gus was a great character. He was largely Walt's intellectual equivalent, and each had their own personal motives for doing what they did, and yet always maintained what they were doing was ""strictly business."" I never saw Gus as any better or worse than Walt... They both did horrible things, and yet believed in what they were doing. (Walt leaving money for his family, Gus avenging his friend's murder).  As for realism... I agree with the other comment that the show was always a bit larger than life. The numerous close calls that Walt had, the amazing coincidences that happened from time to time, etc, they all kept the show believable, but not necessarily realistic. As the Bond series likes to put it, ""beyond probable, never beyond the impossible,"" or something like that."
breakingbad,361guj,drygnfyre,2,Sat May 16 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"I would say this ""unrealism"" started with Tuco. Breaking Bad was always kind of a larger than life story, which contrasts with my two other favorite shows known for their realism, The Wire and The Sopranos. If you're looking for realism and haven't seen either of these I suggest you check them out."
breakingbad,361guj,Rjbcc58,1 point,Fri May 15 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"I love them both, but I'm not gonna get into a discussion about that on the breaking bad section :)  Yeah, The Sopranos was a supposedly realistic show, but there were departures, like Paulie meeting the ghosts of all the people he killed, and there were microapperances from dead characters here and there, in mirrors and stuff  I really love Breaking Bad too, I just think I see it as a different type of show than a lot of the fans, and how I see it is of course no more valid than anyone elses"

breakingbad,35pvkn,Question_4_you_guys,249,Tue May 12 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"I think the dislike for those characters is because they are ""breaking up the fun"". There are a lot of fans who just want the action and cool stuff and these characters remind people that there are human lives being affected by these crimes and they don't like it. They are reminders of how far Walt has fallen. Walt is not a hero, he is a protagonist and I think a lot of viewers do not know the difference. Because of that they don't like the ladies."
breakingbad,35pvkn,GoldandBlue,68,Tue May 12 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  In the earlier seasons, whenever I'd see Skyler on screen I'd get the exact same sinking feeling as when I was a kid playing with my friends in the yard and my mom would yell out the back door that it's time for them to go home and me to come inside for dinner.  Her appearance means no more wacky desert drug dealing shenanigans for a while.  So it's natural for us to associate her with that awful ""playtime's over"" feeling.  But for people who actually take a moment to think about why they're having the reactions they're having, the fact is, she was right.  She was right about everything.  She always was."
breakingbad,35pvkn,elbruce,15,Tue May 12 21:21:55 2015 UTC,I totally agree.  I think that on a second watch people know the entire arc and how things end pretty badly for the ones who were so driven.  You get to watch them being the only ones with a sense of reality and safety.
breakingbad,35pvkn,OnusDefacto,8,Tue May 12 19:40:45 2015 UTC,And in the end Marie suffers greatly by losing her beloved Hank. Incredibly sad she didn't deserve to lose him :/ this applies as well to Walt Jr as well

breakingbad,35pvkn,GoldandBlue,36,Wed May 13 01:34:07 2015 UTC,Relevant Op-Ed piece Anna Gunn wrote for the New York Times about fans hating Skyler.
breakingbad,35pvkn,chocolatewaltz,24,Wed May 13 03:08:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, interesting read. It is pretty awful that the hate sometimes diverted to her as an actress.   After watching again, yeah sometimes she's annoying but the same goes for every single character on the show. I disliked her cause of the same mindset as others, she was dragging Walt down and I was really routing for him to succeed. After watching again, Walt really is a monster and she just kind of, dealt with it the best she could. Probably better than I would of in that situation! Lead me to have a lot more sympathy for her, second time round I was routing for her."
breakingbad,35pvkn,elbruce,24,Tue May 12 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"she was dragging Walt down   I'd argue that the crystal meth manufacturing, the drug dealing, the murders and the lying were what was dragging Walt down."
breakingbad,35pvkn,mtpdc,3,Tue May 12 19:03:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Morally, yes, but in my first path, I liked that Walt was doing bad things and fighting back. I totally bought into the idea that he was a kind but meek person who through a series of unfortunate events found himself being the person who other people walked on and didn't respect. I liked that he was Breaking Bad because I felt like he was making up for all the times people dismissed him (e.g. the guys making fun of Walt Jr. in the clothing store).  My second pass through, I didn't feel as good about what Walt was doing and definitely empathized with Skylar and Marie more (though I still loved how Walt handled the clothing store!)."
breakingbad,35pvkn,JimmyHavok,3,Tue May 12 21:28:01 2015 UTC,"I think before Walt broke bad, he had that monster in him, he almost knew it was there, but he held it down with his meekness, and being henpecked by Skylar helped."

Walt put her through hell and back and she acted how I assume anyone in her shoes would
breakingbad,35pvkn,elbruce,17,Wed May 13 04:05:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe the first time around we didn't realize how bad it would get.  And all her dire warnings of ""bringing danger to the family"" we were like ""meh, quit worrying.""  Re-watches have hindsight to show us just how prescient she was."

breakingbad,35pvkn,Shalamarr,49,Wed May 13 09:08:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, one of my favorite scenes towards the end of the series was when the scales finally fell from Walter Jr.'s eyes, and he realized the truth about his parents.  For so long, he'd treated his mother with contempt and idolized his father.  Discovering the truth was horribly painful for the poor kid, and Skylar was probably heartbroken for him, but I'd bet money that part of her was thinking ""FINALLY."""
breakingbad,35pvkn,babrooks213,31,Tue May 12 19:25:40 2015 UTC,"In a way, Walter Jr. could represent the viewer in that scene. For so long, his dad could do no wrong, just like the viewers thought that Walt could do no wrong. He was totally justified in everything he did, and all the little hints and unpleasantness could be ignored or explained away (""well of course he had to do that, he had no choice!"").  And when Walt Jr. finally realized what a monster his dad was, it could also represent one of the many moments that the viewer had that same revelation. It doesn't necessarily have to be that exact scene where the viewer comes to the same conclusion as Walt Jr. (for me it was the Lily of the Valley scene), but it's that same process, that same awakening and re-adjusting of perspective.  TL;DR: We're all Walt Jr. Now where's my breakfast?"
breakingbad,35pvkn,SirMothy,13,Tue May 12 19:39:28 2015 UTC,For me it was when Walt let Jane die
breakingbad,35pvkn,Shalamarr,12,Tue May 12 20:47:07 2015 UTC,"I was torn about Jane's death.   She was awful for Jesse, and she was blackmailing Walt, but no one deserved to die like that."
breakingbad,35pvkn,GorbiJones,36,Tue May 12 21:22:44 2015 UTC,"She was awful for Jesse   What a lot of people seem to forget is that Jane was clean when she met Jesse. He got her back into doing drugs. It didn't excuse the blackmail, but Jesse wasn't innocent in that situation, either."
breakingbad,35pvkn,SirMothy,8,Tue May 12 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"I think that's the first time Walt realized  that people were just obstacles in his way, Jane, Hank, Mike, Gus, etc"
breakingbad,35pvkn,SouthrnComfort,3,Tue May 12 22:57:11 2015 UTC,Walt was worse for Jesse.
breakingbad,35pvkn,ianturpiesmoustache,118,Tue May 12 22:34:31 2015 UTC,"I always loved Marie. She was neurotic, but one of the kinder, more empathetic characters in the show. She put everyone else's needs above her own and that made her a bit nutty sometimes.  I also never hated Skyler, even if she was never my favourite character. I just don't get the vitriol towards her at all... I mean, shit, I can't imagine having been any smarter or braver if I was put in the same situation as she was. She was the one who was doing it all for the family, not Walt."
breakingbad,35pvkn,GallbladderGone,36,Wed May 13 06:55:09 2015 UTC,So in some ways She was the one that answered when the one that knocks knocked.
breakingbad,35pvkn,ianturpiesmoustache,50,Tue May 12 17:41:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, yeah. As she said herself ""someone needs to protect this family from the man who protects this family"". I think she spent the majority of the show with only that goal in mind, whereas we know Walt had his own motives."
breakingbad,35pvkn,PaulMorel,26,Tue May 12 18:33:50 2015 UTC,"One of the interesting things about BB is the way it gets you to love the bad guys and hate the good guys. Everyone loves Walt and Gustavo even though they are arguably the most evil people on the show. My favorite minor character was Tuco, and he was evil too."
breakingbad,35pvkn,starfirex,32,Tue May 12 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"Gus is in my opinion the best villain on television. A cold, calculating, ultra professional businessman. A ruthless killer, but without flair, without fury, and incredibly patient."

breakingbad,35pvkn,ragby,8,Tue May 12 19:39:32 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you.  Gus is an unforgettable bad guy, logical and reasonable while still being menacing.  And played brilliantly by Giancarlo Esposito."

breakingbad,35pvkn,JimmyHavok,3,Tue May 12 23:04:31 2015 UTC,That was more than a little too far over the top.
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,7,Wed May 13 00:16:36 2015 UTC,"I'm with the AV Club on this one:   I’m sure some will take issue with the fantastic depiction of Gus’s demise, but I loved it.  A character this iconic deserves a mythic death, realism be damned.   Episode six of this show featured Walt blowing up a building, season two ended with a plane crash, it's a little dramatic sometimes - and if anyone deserves a dramatic death, it's the best damn character on the show, the chicken man himself."
breakingbad,35pvkn,ianturpiesmoustache,9,Wed May 13 04:07:40 2015 UTC,"Definitely, the writing was superb and the evil dudes were some of the best, most interesting characters. Hector was my personal favourite. :)  It just bugs me that the two main female characters, who can arguably be called ""the good guys"", get all the hate. I mean, Hank was a major dick some of the time, but he never got any of the loathing they did."
breakingbad,35pvkn,KYplusEL,9,Wed May 13 09:00:48 2015 UTC,Mainly because Hank was funny as he did it.

breakingbad,35pvkn,ianturpiesmoustache,13,Tue May 12 20:54:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I don't think I ever noticed it as much as I had done before. I noticed Hank was very mean to Marie during his recovery and all she was doing was helping, she was pushy and talked a lot but she was lovely to everyone really."
breakingbad,35pvkn,watwat,8,Tue May 12 21:16:42 2015 UTC,"I've rewatched the show a few times (because it's just so bloody good), and every time I pick up something I hadn't noticed before. It's such a vast, interesting story, and there are so many well-written characters. I think all of them have their annoying, selfish moments, but there's very few who deserve the kind of hate Skyler and Marie got initially."
breakingbad,35pvkn,elbruce,8,Tue May 12 19:05:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, however I will say that Marie's kleptomania side plot was kinda weak."
breakingbad,35pvkn,bruddahmacnut,14,Tue May 12 19:28:40 2015 UTC,"True, which is why they pretty much dropped it early on.  There seemed to be no good way to tie it into any other side plot and make it affect anybody else.  So they just let it go.  For all the people who go on about BrBa as if it were pre-conceived in every minor detail before shooting began, it's clear for a variety of reasons that they were winging it as they went along.  Doing so exquisitely, but doing that nonetheless."
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,2,Tue May 12 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"For me, the series really changed S05. Felt like they meant S04 to be the end. S05 just felt contrived a bit."
breakingbad,35pvkn,elbruce,2,Tue May 12 21:25:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, I do think the end of season four has a lot of finality to it, but it would feel incomplete. On the surface level there's Ted and Mike's fates being unknown - but if it ends there, we really don't have much notion of what's going to happen next, Walt never gets caught or dies, Jesse never finds out about Brock or Jane. Season 5 did introduce a lot of stuff like Todd and Lydia and Jack (and Todd/Lydia do feel weaker to me than the S1-4 characters), but it was definitely needed."
breakingbad,35pvkn,buckhenderson,2,Wed May 13 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"I believe they did expect S04 to possibly be the end when they wrote it.  But S05a is great because it allows Walt to ""rule the world"" - go nuts as top dog without there being a ""bigger bad"" to contend with or be afraid of.  So it's a different set of challenges and a different feel, which is a lot of fun."
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,2,Wed May 13 09:02:49 2015 UTC,"in gilligan's recent ama, someone asked him about a major plot element on better call saul, and he said he and the writer's didn't even think of it until they had started writing episode 7 (out of 10)."
breakingbad,35pvkn,elbruce,1 point,Wed May 13 22:19:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's correct. The first season was supposed to have a major shoot-out but it got cut short for the writer's strike. Jesse was going to get beaten to death by Tuco at the end of episode 7 when they settled on that for the finale, but they liked Aaron Paul enough that they killed off No-Doze instead. The Cousins were going to be more major antagonists but they realized they didn't have as much to do with those two; that and Giancarlo pushing hardcore for Gus to become a bigger character (he didn't have a contract to come back on season three, and originally they wanted him to just come back for five episodes; he refused to come back unless they gave him as many as they ultimately did, saying ""Bring me back big or you're not bringing me back at all - because this character's gonna be great if you let him!"") are how we got Gustavo Fring. Tuco's actor had other obligations that prevented him from sticking around on BrBa as long as they'd planned, so they axed him right away into season two when he was originally going to last much, much longer. Mike Ehrmantraut only exists because Bob Odenkirk couldn't come in to fit ABQ. And season 5 in particular I know was sort of on the fly; when they decided to include the machine gun, they didn't even have the idea of Jack in their heads - one ending included the possibly of fucking Walt Jr. accidentally machine gunning himself to death.  And pretty much every single one of these bits of fate made the show way, way better."
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,1 point,Wed May 13 02:47:38 2015 UTC,"I know that isn't how they divide it, but the early season 2 shoot-out at Tuco's really feels like a season finale episode to me, so in my head I kinda think of that as the finale to ""season 1"" (fuck, if they can mess with season 5-6, I can do it to 1-2).  The following episode, when Walt pretends to have amnesia, really feels like a season opener, too: ""the big danger from last season is cleared out now, time to slow down and move the pieces around to set up the next big challenge."""
breakingbad,35pvkn,laffingbomb,2,Wed May 13 09:06:40 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see that. It does conclude that arc - and I love how sometimes, especially in that timeline and in season three, things aren't always paced in the most expected way. Like ""One Minute"" is one of the biggest episodes of season three and comes halfway through, and then soon after that you get an episode about swatting a fly."
breakingbad,35pvkn,Petrollika,0,Wed May 13 22:03:14 2015 UTC,"It did make me think Marie wasn't any better than Walt at the start of the series. And it kind of discredited her character until later on, when she spoke to her therapist about it."
breakingbad,35pvkn,disaster_face,32,Wed May 13 22:44:04 2015 UTC,"I always really liked Marie.    To me, Skylar acted completely appropriately towards Walt... except in the first few episodes.    I disliked her right from the very first episode. Walt worked two jobs while she sat at home and worried about expenses. When he was diagnosed, she took everything into her own hands without consulting him at all. I can see that it came from a good place, but at the same time I felt so sorry for this man who went through life being constantly ordered about by his wife. That was unforgivable to me. It's been a while, but I can't even remember her asking him how he felt about what was going on.      Once Walt turned into this monster of a man, I began to empathise with Skylar a lot more. But the way she acted in the first few episodes cemented her character in my mind, and it was very difficult to like her."
breakingbad,35pvkn,ill_mango,12,Wed May 13 06:34:40 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%.  For me it was when she gave him so much shit when she thought he was smoking weed.  It was really the first few episodes that made me not like her, but yeah, her later actions were completely understandable.  The reason some people tend to dislike her so much more than Walt is that she was unlikable in a very common way... we've probably all met people like her whom we didn't like.  Walt on the other hand was unlikable in such a larger than life way that it was much more fascinating."
breakingbad,35pvkn,jjolla888,1 point,Tue May 12 19:34:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is me too.  I can usually empathize with people, so I never really had a problem with Marie - she was just a woman with some unresolved issues.  Meanwhile, in the first few episodes, Skylar reminded me of every entitled b*tch I had ever encountered.  I hated how she continually emasculated him (the ebay handjob scene was BRUTAL), I hated how she never appreciated him.  In my mind, being so powerless at home made Walt love the power he got from making drugs and ""winning"" at dealing.  I think Walt lost most of his power the moment he got Skylar pregnant, and so dealing was a way for him to regain it.  I always felt that part of the reason he got so deep into the drugs was because of the way Skylar treated him.  It's not an excuse, just an explanation.  I think her later actions were more understandable, but in the first few episodes I couldn't stand her."
breakingbad,35pvkn,sicarius45,7,Tue May 12 20:17:27 2015 UTC,Marie was hideous when she coerced Skyler to reveal everything to Jr.
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,4,Wed May 13 07:08:42 2015 UTC,I believe if Walt had truly been caught Hank should have been the one to tell him
breakingbad,35pvkn,mrwho995,2,Wed May 13 00:57:25 2015 UTC,"Walt had been caught at that point. Flynn was going to find out anyway - there was 0 way around it. As she said, the alternative would very possibly be him finding out on the news or from a police officer or something."
breakingbad,35pvkn,jjolla888,2,Wed May 13 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"Can you explain the problem you had with that? In my mind she was just trying to ensure that Jr heard about it all in the least bad way possible, from a loved one rather than from a rumour or on the news."
breakingbad,35pvkn,ErikEzrin,2,Wed May 13 09:34:35 2015 UTC,"(i) it may be ok to suggest/advise that Skyler tells him everything, but Marie basically blackmailed her into doing it. She was motivated into turning his family against Walt ... not necessarily for Jr's benefit. In any case, that level of coercion is not something to admire   (ii) as Walt explained to Hank - he will have a hard time proving anything on Walt (just because you saw his actions on TV does not make it easy to convict in a court) - and - his cancer is likely to kill Walt before he can even set foot in a jail. With his family's help (Skyler/Marie/Hank), and given that Walt had retired by then, there was a good chance that Jr may never have had found out (at least not until he was a lot older or an adult)"
breakingbad,35pvkn,ErikEzrin,14,Thu May 14 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"Both Hank, Marie and Walt have insecurity issues, but express it in different ways. I can definitely see both sides of ALL characters, and that's what's so good about this show.  However, one thing which puzzled me about Skylar was.... well, Walt SIGNED the divorce contract. She could have taken it. She could even have turned him in before (but I get she wanted to protect Flynn/Jr.) She could just have divorced him after he signed the contract and leave it at that, yet she didn't."
breakingbad,35pvkn,Beyond-The-Blackhole,28,Fri May 15 00:58:36 2015 UTC,"Aye aye, I remember this.   There was something Skyler said which made me believe she was very clever in not filing them. Something along the lines of 'Married couples cannot be forced to testify against one another'. I think that is what I heard and it felt like a whole switch around, like shit... She smart yo."
breakingbad,35pvkn,elbruce,7,Tue May 12 15:31:27 2015 UTC,"Hmmm yeah indeed.  I kinda forgot the exact details of this part, I shall pay extra attention to it during my re-watch.  But at that point, why would Skylar see that as a pro? She hadn't done anything wrong by then, the only one who could have been incriminated would have been Walt."
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,8,Tue May 12 15:55:18 2015 UTC,"I think it was pretty much how saul explained it to walt. If she testifies against walt she loses everything, including the house. Her and her families repuation is ruined, it will destroy marie and hank. She wont be financially stable to support her family alone, the police will take all the money earned while they were married and no one will hire her anymore. I think she just saw it as a much easier solution to support walt and help him hide the business in a smart way so she can be sure he never gets caught."
breakingbad,35pvkn,elbruce,9,Tue May 12 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"And remember, he should be dying any time now.  Within another year at best.  If he can just get enough money, stop killing people and make the evidence go away, he dies and she gets out free and clear with everything.  I think that was her whole mindset in the later seasons."
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,2,Tue May 12 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"Yup. I was never too shocked by ""For the cancer to come back"" - I mean, I fucking love it, I've rewatched that scene a hundred times, but I wasn't surprised when she said it - because she said the same exact thing to her lawyer in season three."
breakingbad,35pvkn,elbruce,9,Tue May 12 21:31:33 2015 UTC,"Vince Gilligan has said that Skyler deciding not to turn Walt in was the only time the writers were forced to have her go against character.  Because if she did what she obviously knew she should have done, the show would be over."
breakingbad,35pvkn,i_am_thoms_meme,2,Wed May 13 09:11:25 2015 UTC,"Ooh, do you know where he talked about that? I'd be interested to see it.  I noticed that on a rewatch for sure - that really, the reason she can't turn him in is because the show couldn't very well have ended with ""ABQ."" (Although I do fucking love that episode, maybe more than any other episode in the entire series - it's basically tied with the more obvious pair of Ozymandias/Face Off.) And so considering that, I think they did an excellent job of justifying her decision and making it sympathetic.  It makes a lot more sense when you see them starting from ""Skyler can't turn Walt in"" and working backwards to ""So why doesn't she?"", rather than starting from ""What should Skyler do?"" and going forwards to not turning him in."
breakingbad,35pvkn,comedicallyobsessedd,2,Tue May 12 21:29:39 2015 UTC,"Google is failing me.  The older the information gets, the harder it gets to find something very specific.  I'm sure I remember him talking about that, though."
breakingbad,35pvkn,TavarisJackson,6,Wed May 13 09:13:21 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you.  At first I disliked them both, then it was really only Marie.  Once I saw how conniving Skyler could be when she played those IRS guys by acting ""blonde"" I had a ton of respect for her.    But it wasn't until the second watch that I really noticed how Marie is just trying to protect the family by doing what she did.  Plus she's a fucking saint for putting up with emo Hank after he got shot and just couldn't help feeling sorry for himself."
breakingbad,35pvkn,dman24752,4,Wed May 13 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear that rewatching the show has made a lot of people change their viewpoints on Skyler and Marie. Skyler was one of my favorite characters when I first watched the show (along with Mike and Saul), probably because a) I watched most of the show in one go and avoided reading about it online and b) never sympathized with Walt even though I liked watching him. I was really surprised when I learned how hated she was.  Edit: Marie never seemed that interesting to me, but there was definitely no reason for me to dislike her."
breakingbad,35pvkn,zbo2amt,14,Wed May 13 01:17:40 2015 UTC,Skyler smoked while pregnant. Walt only made meth.
breakingbad,35pvkn,Benjamin1353,6,Wed May 13 02:56:19 2015 UTC,I'll give you an upvote because that made me laugh for some reason.
breakingbad,35pvkn,Puggerfly,2,Tue May 12 22:48:07 2015 UTC,"As soon as I watched that scene, and the woman in the car looking judgmentally at her, it made me wonder if that was why Jr. was on crutches. I forgot his diagnosis, but I remember looking it up and smoking during pregnancy was a possible cause. Made me realize everyone you think is good can be bad, and everyone you peg as bad can be good."
breakingbad,35pvkn,Benjamin1353,-3,Tue May 12 23:20:36 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure she already had Holly when she started to smoke. Could be wrong though.
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,4,Mon May 18 03:08:55 2015 UTC,"People seem to be using the downvote as a ""dislike"" button. But no, Skyler definitely smoked while she was pregnant with Holly. Walt caught her once and I'm fairly certain (it's been a while since I've rewatched everything) someone in a parking lot made a judging face or said something to pregnant Skyler while she was smoking and Skyler yelled at the person or something along those lines. Someone with a better memory can correct me!"
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,2,Tue May 12 23:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yea I can remember someone looking at her in the car while she was smoking, I just thought that she already had Holly at that point. Your probably right though, my memory of that part is a little hazy."
breakingbad,35pvkn,NewToSociety,2,Wed May 13 05:11:57 2015 UTC,"Skyler smoking was the last scene of episode S2E4, ""Down."" Skyler went into labor at the end of S2E11, ""Mandala"", and Holly was born by the start of S2E12, ""Phoenix."""
breakingbad,35pvkn,SouthrnComfort,2,Wed May 13 06:39:05 2015 UTC,"She didn't yell at them, but you're correct that she smoked in a parking lot while pregnant. It was seven episodes before Holly's birth."
breakingbad,35pvkn,Snumpler,8,Wed May 13 09:14:26 2015 UTC,"If anybody was ""doing it for the family"" it was Skyler."
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,3,Wed May 13 09:14:45 2015 UTC,"I sympathized with Skyler from the start. She was dealing with more shit than anyone and, in my opinion, dealt with it extremely well and did what she could for the actual benefit of her family while Walt was doing it all for himself in the guise of putting his family first.  Marie, though, I just could not stand her. She was one of those people with absolutely no boundaries and focused on everyone else's issues while ignoring her own."
breakingbad,35pvkn,Necromorphiliac,3,Wed May 13 04:16:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  When I re-watch shows or movies I sometimes like to take on another character's POV than the protagonist to see if their actions make sense.  My friend and I came to the conclusion that Skyler's almost bipolar actions throughout the series are the direct result of a few things.   She married a man named Walter White, but as we see through the mentioning of Gray Matters and the flashback scenes he was a different man.  A stronger man than we observed in the pilot when he is teaching.  This is the first Walter White and original. After losing out of the company we see the emergence of a softer man, Walt. Who is known for being shy around Skyler (crossword puzzle flirting) and is almost passive in his attempts to woo her.  This is the man that she marries and is the man we observe teaching highschool. We see the beginnings of a reemergence of the Walter White from the past.  The one who wanted to make a name for himself.  Through the events of the show though we can clearly see that this drive is overwhelmed by the personality of Heisenberg.   Skyler's observations were only of ""Walt"" or person #2 throughout their marriage.  She was surprised (as seen in the sexual encounters) by the emergence of Walter White or person #1, the personality with a backbone and HORRIFIED when discovering person #3 Heisenberg.  Although all of Walt's development progressed naturally for us, and we can distinctly see the differences, Skylar was not given the same information as us and therefore her reactions were perfectly reasonable and understandable.  In fact, it is almost like Walt, from her perspective, was a bi-polar character."
breakingbad,35pvkn,SentrySappinMahSpy,1 point,Wed May 13 06:53:49 2015 UTC,"make a name for himself   I never realized how that's literally what he's doing by creating the ""Heisenberg"" moniker. Interesting interesting."
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,5,Wed May 13 07:29:54 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it came from how long the Skylar/Marie feud went on when we all just wanted to see more of Walt and Jessie.  And the ""SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP"" scene will never not be annoying.  Other than that, I never hated either character like a lot of people seemed to."
breakingbad,35pvkn,Necromorphiliac,14,Wed May 13 09:58:09 2015 UTC,I loved that scene. Skyler's just reached the absolute limit of how much of Marie's inane babbling that she can take.
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,2,Tue May 12 18:02:03 2015 UTC,"That feud really wasn't as drawn-out as I thought on the rewatch. It develops in the season one finale. We see it in episode one of season two a little bit, and it gives us the excellent Hank/Skyler scene where she breaks down to him, so it's worth it. Episodes 2 and 3 it's put on hold because we gotta deal with Tuco stuff and its fallout, episode 4 was a really dark and bleak episode (one of my favorite episodes in the series - way underrated) and the feud just wouldn't have fit with its tone. Then in episode 5 they resolve it swiftly.  It was introduced in one episode, it gave us an emotional Sky scene in another, and then it was resolved in the next; there was some time in between that where it was put on ""pause"" while we dealt with Tuco (""Grilled""/""Dead Bee"") and melancholy (""Down""), but of course that also means it really wasn't going on in those episodes. It bugged me the first time around but it's barely even a thing on a rewatch.  I always felt bad for her in the ""SHUT UP"" scene, it was just the culmination of a bunch of stress for her."
breakingbad,35pvkn,SirMothy,2,Tue May 12 20:55:21 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about rewatching it lately because I haven't done so since the series ended.  It felt like it was drug out across a whole season the first time, but that's probably because I jumped in late and watched from season 1 up until halfway through 4 in the span of a week or two, so it all kinda ran together haha.  I'll have to watch it again and see how I feel about that part this time.  I'll probably try to keep it down to 2 episodes at a time maximum so I can digest it all better."
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,2,Wed May 13 09:32:05 2015 UTC,"It's definitely worthwhile, and that's how I've been watching it as well. I did 2 or so at a time while watching through the first time and it took me about three months to get through the whole series, and now I'm doing a rewatch with a friend who hasn't seen it, again with a few at a time - typically 2, sometimes a few more or just one. And both times I'd individually reflect on each episode or episode cluster after watching. It definitely lets you take a lot more in to go at that pace and focus more strongly. As far as the tiara is concerned, it definitely didn't bug me as much or feel as drawn-out the second time; it technically does last six episodes (lol one-tenth of the series) but that's only because half of them wouldn't have been an appropriate place to bring it up and kill it off."
breakingbad,35pvkn,your_mind_aches,2,Wed May 13 12:16:32 2015 UTC,Skyler walking into the pool was pretty lame as well
breakingbad,35pvkn,DeVitoMcCool,3,Wed May 13 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"Why do you think so? It set up the awesome, Emmy-winning exchange between her and Cranston, it was a great ploy to get the kids out of the house but also pretty emotional because it was a legitimate action coming from a place of deep hurt, the shot of her in the had the symbolism of being immersed in blue, had her at peace for once being away with everyone, and was beautifully shot. It was very different in tone than stuff like Gus's face kersploding but I think it was a brilliantly done moment, and very important for her character and the narrative."

breakingbad,35pvkn,elbeejo,6,Thu May 14 12:54:34 2015 UTC,Skyler was actually my favorite character throughout Breaking Bad. I think the writing was that good where every character had agreeable and disagreeable qualities to them. It's similar to Mad Men in that way.
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,2,Thu May 14 14:32:44 2015 UTC,"I think the hate for Skyler (and to a lesser extent Marie) is more focused on the reality of their actions instead of how much people can relate to those actions.  Marie was kind of tame to me btw, just kind of a klepto with self esteem issues - Skyler was different.  She was a confident woman that retreated inside even though she possibly had the strength to do otherwise.  In real life, almost everything those two did makes complete sense under the circumstances - but it's not about that, we're watching a show in a fictional universe, and people like to see fictional characters rise above and beyond in abnormal circumstances.  It's pretty easy to respond to bad actions with more bad actions, and that's what those two did, especially Sky.  We will never know if Walt would have changed if Skyler gave him more support, but it was very easy to understand and quite predictable to know that her lack of support would make things worse.  It was pretty cringe worthy to watch her respond to unfortunate events with things that would make things more unfortunate, and she kept doing it over and over.  Did her lack of support make sense?  Well, yeah, of course it did.  It would have been nice to see a different path though, no matter how much more challenging it would have been to write it."
breakingbad,35pvkn,3ebfan,2,Tue May 12 20:45:13 2015 UTC,I was really bothered by how the writers just ditched Marie's klepto backstory.
breakingbad,35pvkn,lebartlehara,1 point,Wed May 13 02:22:47 2015 UTC,"They brought it back again in early season four to further characterize her and Hank when he was in his depression. It didn't advance the plot - but it wasn't ditched, either; I do think it gave us some decent content early on, and then they brought it back in a much more emotional way later on. It didn't move the plot, but it built the characters."
breakingbad,35pvkn,greasywiener,2,Wed May 13 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"I've always loved Marie. Her and Hank totally rocked the role of the crazy in-laws. I couldn't imagine the show with a different set of actors in their shoes. She was so funny.  Skyler, I don't know, I just completely understood where she was coming from so it was easy for me to empathize with her. Skyler's emotions felt so real. Remember when she got in the pool and tried to drown herself? That was figurative of how Walts blue meth was suffocating her, leaving her with no where to run, no one to talk to. She couldn't tell her sister, she couldn't talk to her son, she couldn't even talk to Walt. She had nobody. She was hopeless and alone and lost, and she showed that in everything she did."
breakingbad,35pvkn,thisishardcore_,2,Wed May 13 09:54:17 2015 UTC,"Very well put. Skyler's not exactly likeable, but is she bad? Does she deserve hate? No, for sure her situation was awful and when no escape was possible she did whatever she could to make it hard for Walt, but why shouldn't she? Just because we are on Walt's side (against our better judgment maybe, but still) doesn't mean we should lose empathy for the other characters. The way Hank treats Marie would be really hard for any real person to handle but she hangs in there and helps him through it. They definitely deserve more sympathy even if neither are actually that likeable as people."
breakingbad,35pvkn,dman24752,1 point,Wed May 13 04:26:15 2015 UTC,"My opinion absolutely shifted.  First watch I was all about Team Walt.  Second watch his flaws stood out a lot more.  I mean, I still love the guy, but it really became clear how much Skyler loved him, what a supportive wife she was, and how his personal insecurities drove her away.  All her ""bitchiness"" is wanting her kids to be protected from a megalomaniac drug kingpin and the type of people that lifestyle attracts, fuck her, right?  edit: Also, it seemed like when she accepted the life it was very begrudgingly, was mob-wife style where she revealed in the lifestyle but wanted to pretend like she didn't no where it was coming from."
breakingbad,35pvkn,starfirex,4,Wed May 13 06:27:52 2015 UTC,"You know, I honestly had no idea Marie was such a well liked character until I started reading this subreddit. Literally everywhere else she's regarded to be annoying or just...meh, yet for some reason she seems almost as popular as Walt, Jesse, Saul or Gus on here. I agree that she's loyal to those close to her, but apart from that I can't really think of much which made people ""really like"" her.  As for Skyler. Yes, Walt became a monster, and yes, from Walt fanboys perspectives she is like a ghost at the feast, but cheating on Walt was pretty unforgivable, regardless of the circumstances. It was her who put the idea in Walt Jr's head that Walt killed Hank, and never gave Walt chance to explain himself either. Obviously a very well written character but that doesn't make her likeable.  To be fair, I dislike/hate most people on the show apart from Saul, Gus and Mike. And I guess Badger and Skinny Pete."
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,5,Tue May 12 22:44:40 2015 UTC,You can't really blame her for cheating on him. He was essentially blackmailing her into staying with him and being an accomplice for him. Lashing out the way she did isn't really inexcusable in that circumstance.
breakingbad,35pvkn,therealabefrohman,4,Tue May 12 21:44:14 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned this before, and I immediately agreed with them. Viewers don't hate Skyler because of her actions, they hate her because generally when she's on screen she's preventing Walt from getting back to the story we're all so invested in. When he's facing off with Gus at the end of S4, we don't want to see Skyler on his case, we want to see him maneuvering to get the upper hand on Gus. We want to see him cooking meth, not ameliorating his wife.  They're good characters, just not as interesting as the competition."
breakingbad,35pvkn,TehMightyMidget,2,Tue May 12 23:27:45 2015 UTC,"My perspective is - and was from the first episode - that it's those things that make the story complex and interesting. Explosions and stuff are fun, but him having to go home and deal with the aftermath is what keeps the series complex, unorthodox, and somewhat grounded in reality and what gives it its wider themes and narratives. Though I can get why others disagreed, especially on initial viewings, I wouldn't say that they aren't as interesting - just that many people didn't find them to be so, especially at first glance. Breaking Bad wouldn't be Breaking Bad, and Walt wouldn't have been breaking bad, without those scenes."

breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,2,Wed May 13 09:45:00 2015 UTC,"Re-watching has made me dislike Skyler MORE, but I went from not finding Marie very annoying at all (with a few exceptions, overreactions are hard to watch from any character) to feeling really sorry for her. Honestly, towards the end of the series, Skyler treats her like complete garbage simply because she wants to know what's going on, it's horrible."

All the while his live is becoming evermore difficult and is actually tearing his family apart. I stopped routing for him as much and wanted him to quit.

Even before that, I think that this excuse is pretty much blown out of the water in ""Gray Matter"" when he turns down the money. ""I did it for me, I was alive"" is a big deal because it's him admitting it to himself finally - but as far as what it tells us, it's really just a re-iteration of his episode 5 discussion of wanting and needing a choice, to feel that he's living until he dies. I loved that episode the first time and even more on a subsequent viewing when I could place it within the context of the series as a whole, and I was really happy to see Vince name it as one of his favorites.

All while she kept looking down at Walter like he was a bad person, which he was, but she willingly became  a part of it, and had no problem with reaping the benefits.   At least Walter was up front about what he was. She was right there with him, while claiming to be above it."

breakingbad,35pvkn,McWaddle,1 point,Wed May 13 04:57:31 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest here. It started out that Walt was building his nest egg, then it turned into the kind of adventure that only dreams are made of.   Putting myself in Walt's shoes here, Skyler was cold, calculated and supportive through most of my endeavor. It seemed that the feeling was mutual that we had a good thing going. We were going to be rich, just like we had planned with Grey Matter, and we were eventually going to return to normalcy. That we had our occasional bouts was only a slight misgiving and it seemed clear that we were both willing to accept that we had been brash during the heat of various moments. As we all know, it all came crashing down after a multitude of attempts to reclaim lost assets when things got hectic with the police. I believe that Skyler acted in the best interest of the family in ratting on me, and I'd've done the same if it had been her who led a dangerous crime ring against the best interests of our family, but that was my duty that I chose individually.   It disturbs me that so many people feel so strongly about the characters in fiction that they urge to publicly express their violent disdain for them. Typecasts form and careers are ruined for less."

Skyler was a bitch from the first episode. Everyone treated Walt like shit and she was the worst offender. Her response to Walt keeping secrets was to escalate their problems, to smoke while pregnant and then start an affair with her boss. ""I Fucked Ted.""  Both were cases of sticking your dick in crazy. Don't stick your dick in crazy."
breakingbad,35pvkn,DabuSurvivor,0,Wed May 13 07:00:42 2015 UTC,"I have rewatched, and considered Marie and Skylar's roles on the show. This sounds terrible, but i think my like/dislike for Marie and Skylar is (projected? / amplified?) by my own marriage, and I think Marie is really the female hero of the story, as counterpoint to Skylar's female anti-hero.   My wife is very much the Marie type. Selfless, fun, loyal, fierce, passionate, and maybe a little crazy. I thought Marie was wonderful character who stood beside Hank through the highs and lows of being Hank. Hank of course being the male hero to Walt the male anti-hero.   I didn't like Skylar because she couldn't / wouldn't support her partner. She is very much unlike my wife. Skylar was for the most part, weak, selfish and self centered, with only enough moral compass to keep her believable. I get that that the show needed this character, but it did make her unlikeable to anyone who expects a wife to be a full partner, for better or worse.     TLDR: Hank and Marie are classic heros , Skylar and Walt classic anti-heroes to the modern relationship ethos"

After a while, I got over that and saw how tough of a situation she was put in. I never really blamed her for anything she did after she found out what Walt was doing.   Marie, on the other hand, I disliked from the beginning and still do. I just don't like people that are nosey, and she seemed to be just that.

He says that at one point, after Brock is cured: ""it wasn't even the ricin, it was just some very common plant, yknow, the lilly of the valley"" or something like that.  After that he freaks out because he thinks the ricin is still 'out there' and maybe an innocent person could have ingested it and died. Walt knows this cannot be the case, as he took it himself, but agrees to search Jesse's house for it. He puts a ploy 'ricin' cigarette with normal table salt in Jesse's roomba, and then flushes it, after which Jesse is reassured the ricin is gone.  Also, I think he knew he wasn't going to get out of that nazi den alive. Hence the goodbye to Skylar (telling her the truth and asking to see Holly one last time) and all of that. If he wouldn't have been killed, he would probably rather have pulled the trigger himself than be locked in jail (""live free or die"")  I don't think he was deliberately planting clues about his whereabouts though. I think he called the DEA because he felt guilty and remorseful after his sons reaction on the phone, but then changed his mind when he saw the news (Elliot and Gretchen diminishing his contribution to the company even more), and decided he had to take revenge, even if it was the last thing he'd do. I think leaving the watch was more of a 'leaving behind of Jesse' thing. He thinks he's dead after all, and when he learns he's still cooking I bet he wanted to kill him for it too, but when he sees him all enslaved like an animal, his human side gets back to him, and on instinct decides to save him."

breakingbad,35slus,ErikEzrin,4,Wed May 13 19:08:12 2015 UTC,"It wasn't speculation. He says it straight and clear that the doctors discovered he was poisoned by the lilly of the valley and not ricin, hence why he searches his appartement so frantically: now he knows Brock wasn't poisoned by the ricin, he thinks he might have lost it, and someone innocent could ingest it.  Later when he bumps up to Huell on his way out of Saul's office and notes his weed has been pickpocketed from him, he puts one and one together and realizes he never lost the ricin, but that he was right all along."
breakingbad,35slus,ErikEzrin,-1,Wed May 13 21:09:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, I meant that he realized that Walt did not use the ricin on Brock. So does this mean that Jessie doesn't think Walt was behind Brock's illness? Or does he then automatically assume that Walt used Lily of the Valley."
breakingbad,35slus,MetalGFX,1 point,Wed May 13 21:28:21 2015 UTC,"At first he thinks Walt did pickpocket the ricin cigarette (= correct) and used it on brock (= incorrect). Then Walt convinces him that he did neither pickpocket the cigarette nor poison him with it.  Then when Brock recovers the docs tell Jesse he wasn't poisoned by ricin but by the lilly of the valley. So he knows Walt didn't use the ricin, as the doctors told him (and that's the truth). He still doesn't know where the ricin cigarette is though, and Walt convinces him by using a ploy that it was simply in his Roomba. He believes this and apologises profousely to Walt for ever suspecting him. At this point he has no idea Walt used the lilly of the valley.  Just when he finds out that Huell robbed him of his weed, he realized he (Huell) bumped into him few months earlier, and that he was right all along.   When he knows Huell robbed his ricin cigarette, he realized they must have been ordered by Walt (as no one else knew of the location of the ricin), and thus that Walt is the one who poisoned Brock with the lilly of the valley and lied to him all along.  It's a bit of a complex storyline, but I hope it's clear now."

breakingbad,35slus,ryderj99,2,Wed May 13 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"I think that he probably intended to get shot by his own gun - he only missed the line of fire because he tackled Jesse to save him as an impulsive decision. I'm torn on how much of a trail he left, though. To me it just feels hard to believe and feels like they were trying to wrap up loose ends more than anything - which they did well, but.. I don't feel like they did it believably, to have him leave such a trail and still manage to get every single place he wants and needs to get. I mean this guy's former business associates were on national news, and now he can just walk through his hometown and nothing happens? He looked different with the beard and all, but still, I have a hard time buying it.  That's a good point on the fake calls, though. I could see how that would help him and didn't think of that, though it'd have been nice to see it in the show. I don't know if they've ever said that was the intent behind that line but it's at the very least some good headcanon.  Saul and Walt had both corroborated the poisoning story. The doctors had already verified that it wasn't ricin, so Walt having used ricin on someone else (could have been another batch for all Jesse knew) doesn't really affect anything at that point - and by then, after Jesse had been away from Brock and Walt for months, and when Brock's poisoning was I think over a year ago, and Jesse had been tortured by neo-Nazis for months and was finally breaking free, I think he just wanted to get the fuck out and was too defeated for rage.  I like the finale more now than I did the first time I watched it. It still sort of feels too... easy, plot-wise, and too traditionally ""satisfying"" narratively for Breaking Bad, and I would have liked to see Granite State feature Jesse running off with Todd/Andrea and Walt getting caught in the car, and then the show ends there.

breakingbad,35ssoe,Samuel_williams,9,Wed May 13 05:15:42 2015 UTC,I think Saul got it over Jesse because there is a lot more to Saul's background that could be told. With Jesse it seems that all there was prior to breaking bad was him flunking out of high school and getting into the drug business where as with Saul there was almost a clean slate and the writers could come up with any story they wanted to leading up to breaking bad
breakingbad,35ssoe,cscrilla,3,Wed May 13 05:39:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I feel like if it were about Jesse after he left Jack's meth lab, it wouldn't really be as much of a spin-off as much of a sequel to Breaking Bad. With Saul on the other hand, we have a completely different show. Other than the fact that it's in the same universe/a lot of similar characters, it's completely different."
breakingbad,35ssoe,Pigwheels,1 point,Wed May 13 16:17:15 2015 UTC,"He's a bit of a sleazebag in BB, though. Not a lot of that in Better Call Saul so far.

Letting that story arc play out would have been great.  It may be that I'm thinking this because I thought Giancarlo Esposito was absolutely brilliant this whole series."

breakingbad,35pvqj,ErikEzrin,29,Tue May 12 15:13:28 2015 UTC,It is extremely easy to make extremely low-purity meth in extremely small quantities.  Walt's obsession is in optimizing the yield of large-scale reactions... making a huge quantity of one isomer (shape) of the methamphetamine molecule.
breakingbad,35pvqj,chemicalwill,-8,Tue May 12 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"But would that be actually WORTH it? Like, would it truly be that much better and worth more?  Compared to the massive process they appearantly go though VS pouring two liquids together and stirring it a bit."
breakingbad,35pvqj,EminGH,17,Tue May 12 15:47:05 2015 UTC,"As a former meth user, yes. I lived in LA so I had access to the good Mexican cartel stuff from across the border. One time I had some shake n bake it was fucking horrible"
breakingbad,35pvqj,erich00041,5,Tue May 12 20:36:56 2015 UTC,"Any drug user who actually cares about the drug will absolutely say so. The less impurities it has the less unknown danger. Sure, pure methamphetamine is still dangerous but it's better than a cocktail of other random chemicals.   Plus (I'm not sure if meth is like this but most drugs are) as purities increase the effects can have extreme variations. For example, some shit weed might get you high, but you'll have headaches in ten minutes and you'll have to smoke another in 30 (because most of this is impure plant matter that is being inhaled). Or you could hit a dab out of an oil rig and be blissfully fucked up/fall asleep for the night (dabs have much much higher purity and turn into a whole new drug).  Most drugs that I'm aware of follow a similar trend."
breakingbad,35pvqj,chemicalwill,-20,Tue May 12 18:26:26 2015 UTC,"And would you actually need gas masks and hazmat suits n all? The guy on TV wore no protective clothing AT ALL, so I guess the refining is also the most dangerous, or BB is >gulp< inaccurate."
breakingbad,35pvqj,iihavetoes,22,Tue May 12 15:48:30 2015 UTC,"Here in the Southeast US, we get news stories all the time about meth labs blowing up/fumes killing people/animals/etc, so yes you DO need protective equipment, but so often people cooking ""Coke-bottle"" meth don't use it.  As for the value, it would absolutely be worth it. Look at how Walt carefully set up his empire... working with a distributer to sell off an enormous quantity all at once, rather than on the corner with Jesse. The d-methamphetamine isomer provides a much larger stimulus to the central nervous system (the effect meth users are seeking). By purifying his product into a huge majority of this isomer, his product is safer to use (from a toxic impurity standpoint) as well as providing a bigger high, making it much more valuable."

breakingbad,35pvqj,nappyheadedgirl,5,Tue May 12 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"When dealing with relatively small amounts in a large, ventilated area it's not that dangerous.

breakingbad,35pvqj,IWasBilbo,-8,Tue May 12 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"Can't you just keep refining it, yo? You boil it or add certain chemicals that make the stuff that's NOT meth come out in some way, either evaporate or sink to the bottom as residue and then filter it out. I don't know shit about meth, but we did a similar thing with several mixtures in high school chemistry class, and if you're good, you can basically do this with almost any chemical mixture."

This means that molecules are mirror images of each other. Walt as teacher describes how one chiral form of thalydamide was an safe and effective nausea medication, but the other form caused horrible birth defects.  Similarly, when synthesizing meth from methylamine --""old school biker crank"" Hank calls it (bikers used to hide methylamine in their crankshafts, which gives us the early nickname ""crank"")-- half of the product will be methamphetamine, and the other half as its chiral form will have no use as a recreational drug, just a fairly decent cough suppressant.  In the series Walt has supposedly figured out how to isolate a single chiral form of methamphetamine, but they don't go into detail as to how he does it."
breakingbad,35pvqj,1wiseguy,1 point,Tue May 12 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"Yeaah okay, thanks. I guess there might have been a communication misunderstanding, as I thought the person I replied to said the method Walt uses in the series will only grant 50% pure meth, but I think he reffered to the ""easy way"" I mentioned in my post. That makes sense actually, and also explains why the procedure in Breaking Bad is so complex and lengthy, and thus probably (somewhat) realistic. Thank you, I can go back to sleep now."

But I think your right in many ways.   Ever Character transforms throughout show.  BIG theme was the chemistry of change that everyone experiences (even jr tries to get beer at one point ha). Walt's transformation would appear to be in the Bad direction while Jesse appears to grow Softer and more of a conscience.  But i think you have a good point there becasue not only does Jesse do some downright fucked things, but whose to say he wasn't a decent guy before we even meet him.  I doubt he had to do many killings and such before Heisenberg comes along.    Your absolutely right about Walt's Savior aspect towards Jesse.  It would appear that onces he hears Jesse is still alive he desperatly wants to right that wrong from Ozymandias.  Assuming Felina is a Dream or Hallucination it would also appear that Walt has some feelings of guilttowards how he left Jesse to the Nazis... so I think your right about that man."

I believe a lot is told silently just like in Made in America (sopranos ending)
breakingbad,35momo,chaspooley,3,Wed May 13 03:05:43 2015 UTC,"To me Jesse never was the 'bad guy' (yes he fucks up a lot of stuff, GOD, I would have been pissed with him just like Walt multiple times. Leave the keys IN the ignition. SERIOUSLY!? But that doesn't make him 'bad'). But Walt never was ENTIRELY the bad guy for me. Though in the end I did't hope for him to get away with it anymore, I hoped for him to redeem himself.  I think indeed that the reason why people tend to side with Jesse towards the end it the deep remorse and guilt he shows, whereas Walt rationalizes it and gets over it way quicker. Also that Jesse wasn't in it all to feel good and worthy, but to sustain himself financially and JUST that.  But that's the beautiful complexity of this show. Nobody's good, nobody's evil, it's all about choices and circumstances. And that's exactly the way it is in real life."
breakingbad,35momo,ErikEzrin,3,Tue May 12 15:41:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for me, it never really felt like Walt ""turned"" evil. I thought he was a prick from super early on. S2E4 at the absolute latest. I still rooted for him in some isolated instances (""This is not meth"", ""Grilled"", ""4 Days Out"") but I never really thought he was a good guy or whatever. So my viewing experience was also different, but in the opposite way."
breakingbad,35momo,DabuSurvivor,3,Wed May 13 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. I see a lot of people on this sub say ""he didn't do it for his family, he did it for himself. He didn't care about his family as much as he cared about cooking."" which is such BS. If anything had happened to his family in the show, he would have immediately quit cooking. Hell, Jesse wasn't even related to him and Walt still did SO much for him. Walt did way more for Jesse than he deserved. And Hank was a brother-in-law which isn't too too close of family, and so soon as Gus hinted at wanting to kill him, Walt called Saul so he and his family could escape ABQ and he asked for Saul to call the DEA and say there was a hit on Hank so he could be protected. I'm not saying he was an angel, but I don't think he was as selfish and terrible as people make him out to be."
breakingbad,35momo,Pigwheels,6,Mon May 11 23:08:37 2015 UTC,"Walt did a lot of things for Jesse out of guilt. He understood a lot better than most reddit posters that Jesse often ended up in the dangerous situations he did because Walt created those situations. He pulled Jesse out of the drug den to keep him from killing himself because he realized that Jesse was being eaten away with guilt for 'killing his girlfriend' when in actuality, it was Walt who allowed that to happen. He drove over those drug dealers when Jesse was getting ready to shoot them because he understood that him going to Gus and ratting out Jesse had led to Tomas being killed, which he knew would send Jesse on the war path. He never wanted to be responsible for his partner's death because he felt he owed him - and in fact, Jesse pays Walt back by shooting Gale to save Walt's life.  The 'transformation' of Walter is significant. He believes, as we the audience do, that he is doing what he does for the good of his family - as Jesse says, to take care of his people after he's checked out - and yet OVER TIME, the six seasons the show was on the air, we see Walter changed by his experience. That's the whole fucking POINT of the show. Walt went into meth manufacturing/criminal life because he was a prideful man who couldn't bear the thought of leaving his family nothing after he died (so prideful that he wouldn't even take the help offered by his former friend and business partner), but in the process, his character is altered, his worst traits coming to the fore and infecting all those around him, including his brother-in-law and his wife, his children, his own wife, his partner, and the people he did business with. The man with cancer becomes the cancer himself. So there was a transformation, because what he was doing was illegal and dangerous, and in his quest for more, he gets pulled further and further into the criminal mindset, to the point where he is quite okay to whistle a jaunty tune a day after dissolving a 14 year old boy's body in acid.  That was the big divergent fault line between Jesse and Walt. When we first meet Jesse, he's already a criminal/drug addict, but the more that he and Walter go through, the less okay Jesse is with what they're doing. He starts to realize the value of human life, the value of doing something worthwhile, and as he sagely tells Walter at one point, ""I don't know, Mr. White, is a meth empire really something to be proud of?"". No, it's not. And Walter couldn't see that, which led to his undoing. By the fifth season, Walter is no longer 'doing it for the family', he's doing it for himself."
breakingbad,35momo,eva_brauns_team,1 point,Tue May 12 13:49:21 2015 UTC,"I think some of the love for Walt and Jesse are because the actors themselves are great.  Can't hate Malcom's Dad!!

Instead of trying to understand why and getting him to stop (since, you know, he was dying of cancer and having a bit of a life crisis) she pushed him further into his other life.  He was headed that way anyway but she only pushed him further along, whether she knew it or not.  Some of his most important bad decisions in the show come just after he is further estranged from Skylar.   At least this is how I interpreted it."

I'm not saying i didn't sympathize or identify with walt at times, but jesus christ you can't actually try telling me you support his decision making and condemn skylar's.  How fuckin dare a woman want to divorce a meth kingpin.  She should have asked him about his feelie Weelies and been a better wife.  Please  When George R.R. Martin essentially says ""holy shit, THAT'S a fucked up character.  None of the characters i've written are THAT fucked up"" and all of your criticism is directed at the one of the few people that had the power to do anything about Walt's meth empire for a large duration of  show, i think you're missing a huge point that the writers and creators were trying to drive home: WALT WAS A BAD DUDE.  Quit defending him"
breakingbad,35i64f,SmugglingGrapes,5,Mon May 11 07:09:08 2015 UTC,"Just remember that Skyler helped Walt with his operation, she also slept with Ted Beneke multiple times, even while knowing that Ted was in debt of $617,000 with the IRS."

Bad.  But thinking the creators of the show were trying to convey that a woman should have been a better woman and then the man would have been a better man doesn't seem plausible to me.    I think they were trying to convey Walt as an island. He didn't let anyone in.  He wanted everything to be his own.  Fucking over Skyler and Jesse countless times to serve his own ego."

I struggled with their portrayal of most female characters in this series.  Because they seemed to me, to portray them as passive-aggressive, nagging and overly critical.  On the one hand, a lot of women actually are like this, so it is realistic, but on the other hand it kind of makes it seem like every woman is like that, which isn't realistic."
breakingbad,35i64f,nurse_camper,2,Tue May 12 01:38:14 2015 UTC,"I find it kind of funny how when the show itself made it so they're portrayed as clingy and a bit bitchy, no one bats an eye, But as soon as someone posts something about it, all hell breaks loose. Other than that I agree with what you're saying."
breakingbad,35i64f,Lick_a_Butt,2,Tue May 12 11:15:01 2015 UTC,"That's not the moral of the story. The moral of the story is that anyone, given the right circumstances, and subtle enough gradual slope, can suffer from an ethical frog-in-boiling-water phenomenon and come to that place, with the best of intentions. He started cooking because he was dying and wanted to provide for his family after he was gone. It's easy to justify that people should be able to put whatever substance they want into their body, and at least with Heisenberg, they knew they were getting a pure (mostly-)safe product. The problem with an entrepreneurial enterprise that isn't State sponsored (or is even State condemned) is that you can't utilize State resources, such as monopolized force projection, in the form of security from trespass and debt collecting, therefore you must internalize those needs, or outsource them to third parties. Both of which he did. The answer to the problem is to make available the tools of the State to those industries that people which to purchase (decriminalization / legalization), then there's no need to hire outside the establishment and wind up employing psychopaths that shoot kids unprovoked in the desert.  But of course, then, you could buy  Pfizer branded amphetamine with much narrower profit margins and there wouldn't have been such an exploitable markup potential that a startup like Walts' enterprise could capitalize on due to black-market inflationary pressure.  Ironically, it is that very pressure that makes illicit industry so profitable in the first place, and why Al Capone was opposed to the end of Prohibition."
breakingbad,35i64f,Cronyx,3,Mon May 11 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"Walt was a bad dude, but she ragged on him from the very beginning, before he even knew he had cancer. She was a nag."

If she hadn't tried to divorce him he would have lived out the rest of his life being just another boring married man living a normal life until the cancer got him or old age. I don't think I would want to watch that show if it were the case but you get my point.

She continue to stand by him long after his career failed and he had turned to teaching because for Skyler it was never about money or power. She was a mother protecting her children from start to end.  Walt was the one who cared about money and power, arguably more so than the family he claims were the reason for it all, really his actions were ego driven.

I didn't think she would have a role on the series for too long, but when she was sober, she was genuinely likable."

breakingbad,35i64f,AustNerevar,6,Mon May 11 08:44:58 2015 UTC,Saul's secretary was pretty likable.  This show just wasn't one with many likable female characters.

You see everything Walt is going through, which makes it almost impossible to not hate Skylar when she reacts to the small amount she knows about what Walt is doing. The show frames her as an antagonist"
breakingbad,35i64f,3ebfan,22,Sun May 10 22:32:59 2015 UTC,"She's an antagonist but that doesn't mean she's supposed to be hated. That's what this show does, plays on the idea of rooting for the protagonist. Vincey G has even said that he was really surprised by the hardcore Skyler hate and that he thinks she reacted how must ordinary people would when they suddenly ended up married to Heisenberg. Not liking her or thinking she was a poor character is one thing, but saying that she was ""supposed to be hated"" is wrong."

breakingbad,35k4fn,bluekronos,1 point,Mon May 11 03:23:41 2015 UTC,"Why ""you're"" got marked as an error?"
breakingbad,35m3jp,You-Are-A-Blowfish,4,Mon May 11 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"1). I think Gale may have suspected that Gus meant to kill Walt but he wasn't sure. You could see his genuine care and regard when Gus told him about the cancer. Also at least at this time it wasn't like Gus was dropping bodies left and right. I don't think Gale knew what Gus was capable of. I think Gale assumed that the pushing and shoving would involve Walt being fired perhaps.  2). I think they are kinda assholes. But as far as screwing Walt out of his ideas and fracturing the relationship between Walt and Gretchen, I don't think so. I think it's Walt's distorted perspective on events. Gretchen mentions this to Walt in the middle of season 2. Where Walt says ""Fuck you!"" I also believe that while Walt took a buyout from Gray Matter that he contributed more to the company than what Eliot and Gretchen gave him credit for on Charlie Rose. They were simply trying to distance themselves.  3). I believe Walt knows that he is responsible for the plane crash. Hence his undying justification of it especially in 301 No Mas. First in front of the grieving assembly of HS kids and then later to Jesse after he gets out of rehab.  4). Possibly...Vince Gilligan has said that it's a distinct possibility but it's not explicitly stated anywhere.  5). The popular theory is that the talk of family and the kid's toys were indeed a ploy. But I like to believe that he has some sort of kin back in Chile that we don't know about."
breakingbad,35m3jp,dimplepinch,3,Mon May 11 19:24:47 2015 UTC,Excellent. These points almost exactly replicate my own thoughts.
breakingbad,35m3jp,ErikEzrin,2,Tue May 12 03:51:41 2015 UTC,"Think you are totally right there.  Also, that speech was totally one of the most awkward scenes to watch, next to the ""Hmm-mm... great green beans Mrs. White.""-dinner. I didn't even fully understand he was trying to justify what had happened until way later, and it struck me that he knew he caused the plane crash all along. Not so much Jane's death itself, but his response to this made me realize how far he had fallen already. If I caused a plane crash and the suicide of a dad because you watched a girl choke to death... I'd probably blow my own brains out in guilt."
breakingbad,35m3jp,Michigander13,2,Tue May 12 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"I guess I missed it or maybe just don't remember, but how was Walt responsible for the plane crash?"
breakingbad,35m3jp,Michigander13,3,Tue May 12 02:16:47 2015 UTC,"He caused Jane to die. Jane's dad became sad. Jane's dad worked as an air traffic controller. He was depressed, so he wasn't thinking straight. He made a mistake causing two planes to crash in midair, killing 167 innocent people. Jane's dad later attempts to commit suicide. Walt's actions when he hears about the crash and the suicide attempt on the news implies he knows that it was his fault."

breakingbad,35m3jp,ErikEzrin,2,Tue May 12 04:23:30 2015 UTC,"Good questions, I think Dimplepinch answered them pretty well, but this makes me think of some more questions... so if you don't mind:  6) How did Gus know there was a bomb under his car during Walt's first attempt to kill him?  7) Did Gus actually INTEND Tomas to be killed, or did he just mean to say ""Sort it out yourselves, as long as you don't use kids anymore"" basically and did the drug dealers then draw their own conclusions?  8) Did Krazy-8 actually intend to kill Walter with that plate shard when he would have been released, or was it purely out of self-defence? Also, was everything he told Walt about himself a lie or not? (these just keep haunting me...)  9) Why didn't Skylar just divorce Walt after he signed the divorce papers?"
breakingbad,35m3jp,DabuSurvivor,2,Tue May 12 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"6) There are 2 different approaches. The first is that he thought that the entire situation was very odd and suspicious, so he put two-and-two together and figured out that someone (read: Walt) was the one who poisoned Brock, so he correctly guessed that it was a ploy to get Gus killed. Either that or the sun was reflecting off of Walt's glasses, which were perched on his forehead. Gus could have seen the reflection and deduced someone was there watching him, most likely having attached a bomb to his car.  7) Well, he likely didn't intend for the kid to be murdered, but he probably wouldn't have cared either way.  8) Krazy-8 is a manipulative and cunning criminal. He said all those things to win Walt over, and when he was freed, he would instantly kill Walt with the plate shard for revenge because Walt killed his partner and imprisoned him for quite some time.  9) She possibly thought that Walt's secret would be discovered without her help, and if the secret was discovered, then it would lead to her being in trouble as well, so she may have stayed to make sure nobody got suspicious or tried to arrest Walt or anything. Or, she may have just cared about him and not wanted her children to grow up without a father."
breakingbad,35m3jp,DabuSurvivor,1 point,Wed May 13 04:30:22 2015 UTC,"Good ones. I don't see why she'd stay with him for the first possible reason you mentioned though, as she knew hardly anything by the time. She knew he was a meth manufacterer, and tried to divorce him. There were no witnesses or people that could testify against her, besides that: word of a caring mother VS a drug producer? I'm pretty sure if it came down to it Skylar would get off the hook without much trouble. But maybe it was a combination of all those things... that she still cared about him a bit, was also a bit scared of getting in trouble herself, and also didnt want her children to grow up without a father."

breakingbad,35mcna,DabuSurvivor,1 point,Tue May 12 18:10:00 2015 UTC,That's massively interesting! Why was this? Was it that expensive to make?
breakingbad,35mcna,walterpinkman45,5,Tue May 12 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"Oh no. Budget never really was a problem. Believe it or not Breaking Bad's ratings for the first 3 seasons never went above 2 million viewers. Even Season 4 only had one episode with more than 2 million viewers. You have to realize that AMC was not yet prestige television in 2008. Mad Men and Walking Dead hadn't dominated their time slots and in a sense AMC was taking a big gamble with Breaking Bad. They believed in it. But it is rare (especially with today's wealth of greatness on TV) that a cable or network show would survive long enough with that small an amount of viewers. For contrast, Walking Dead pretty much averaged at least 5 million viewers from the get go. But even Mad Men didn't have spectacular ratings. This is where AMC sets itself apart in the golden age--they invest in and value critical responses to their series. Which is a great thing that stands in stark opposition to the traditional network model of televised success."

breakingbad,35hhdq,Slabbo,11,Sun May 10 17:36:30 2015 UTC,none of that evidence would have been brought to the light of day if not for the dozens of stupid decisions Walt made that led to Jesse killing Gale
breakingbad,35hhdq,deejaysea,9,Sun May 10 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"That Walt AND Jesse made. If Jesse didn't want to take revenge on those two drug dealers (ok, granted, they were child murderers), Walt wouldn't have had to run them over in order to save Jesse, which then angered Gus against them, which then again lead to the death of Gale, and eventually Gus. Just think about it, Walt didn't need to save Jesse. He didn't NEED him to make meth or to succeed in his business. He could just have let him die and continue cooking peacefully for Gus with now Gale by his side rather than Jesse. Think about that."
breakingbad,35hhdq,ErikEzrin,2,Sun May 10 16:04:53 2015 UTC,"I always thought that had Walt just not taken the book that he had received from Gale, or had he thrown it out or ripped the front page off, it would have been such a different outcome.   However, that being said I loved how they made Hank find out. Such a simple way, along with how they portrayed his instant light headedness and just generally him panicking."
breakingbad,35hhdq,FireDragon79,5,Tue May 12 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"This is ridiculous. I get that Gale was the catalyst and he left evidence--but to say it's all Gale's fault is an insane overstatement. It wasn't Gale's ""fault"" he was simply the domino...the loose end. He is symbolically linked with Lydia as unfinished business FOR WALT. The decay on Heisenberg's granite monument.   The name GALE can be seen on the walls of Jesse's RAGE game in 407. In 503 (I believe) when Hank and the DEA come to question Lydia at the Texas Madrigal HQ, Lydia is shown framing the letters on the outside window of the building to spell GALE from Madrigal Electromotive (LINK http://i.imgur.com/atS0KTe.png). Also in 504 when Jesse and Mike are arguing about killing Lydia and Jesse asks Walt to ""weigh in here"" Walt is shown fingering a loose thread of his pork pie hat then ""nothing stops this train."" And finally, when Walt meets Lydia at the coffee place in 508 he asks her ""Am I not tying up loose ends for our mutual benefit?""  At least he signed WW and not Walter White. Furthermore, it was Walt's pride and ego that led to his crumbling. HE KEPT THE FUCKING BOOK! HE KEPT IT ON THE TOILET FOR ANYONE TO SEE!!! He could've easily torn out Gale's dedication page    Again in 504 at the end of the episode after Walt shows Skyler Jesse's birthday watch and tells her Jesse had a gun pointed at his head in their living room. ""He changed his mind about me Skyler, and so will you."" Like the copy of Leaves of Grass, the watch exists to Heisenberg as a stroke of his bombastic ego on the road to empire. Heisenberg then retires to bed and places his ticking time bomb watch on his nightstand and ON TOP OF LEAVES OF GRASS.  Walt actually cops to it in 510 Buried. After waking up on the bathroom floor and being tended to by Skyler she asks ""How did Hank find out? Did somebody talk?"" to which Walt replies ""Nobody talked...it was me...I screwed up."""

breakingbad,35eudx,ErikEzrin,10,Sun May 10 02:39:49 2015 UTC,"Well, Jesse was the one who got her back into drugs."
breakingbad,35eudx,jimmy_sage,5,Sat May 9 23:24:35 2015 UTC,"If you think of it, Jesse is in a lot of cases the one who creates a problem, and then leaves it to Walt to 'fix' it. (his way of fixing often involves science, murder, or both) Just take a look at this:  -Emilio and Krazy-8 were brought in by Jesse (after which they turned violent and Walt killed them in self defence)  -Jane got back to Heroin thanks to Jesse. If she wouldn't have gotten addicted again, she would never even have choked to death. Walt wouldn't even have visited their house, to shake Jesse awake, knock Jane over and then... watch her die.  -Walt ran over the two drug dealers with his Pontiac because he tried to save Jesse (who was about to get himself killed), which then set a chain of events in motion which set Gus against them and lead to the death of Gale, Victor, Gus and Hector. (and the poisoning of Brock)  -If Jesse wouldn't have chickened out because he saw a somewhat-menacingly-looking dad and thought Walt wanted to kill him, Walt would probably have confessed enough to Jesse for Hank to arrest him right there, no violence. He wouldn't have called Jack's nazigang to kill Jesse, which made shit spiral totally out of control.   Not saying Jesse is the bad guy and Walt is the one doing the good deeds here (like Walt himself says ""I don't know if you believe in hell, but if there is such a place... we're both already going there, right?""), Jesse clearly has a stronger moral compass and a more sensitive soul, but sometimes he acts as the catalyst for a chain of horrible events. Also a lot of times it's just coincidence or Walt's own stupid fault, but hey, that's the beauty of breaking bad folks :P"
breakingbad,35eudx,ErikEzrin,1 point,Sun May 10 00:20:25 2015 UTC,"Jesse always struck me as stupid enough to fuck up a wet dream. And he fucks up a lot of stuff. Remember he's the one that led Hank to the RV when it was in the junkyard, so Walt had to come up with the Marie in the hospital story."
breakingbad,35eudx,GetOffMyLawn_,11,Sun May 10 07:25:45 2015 UTC,"in your defense of not feeling sorry for Jane, I kinda felt like she was gold digging when she found out about the money that Walt owed to Jessie. Seemed like she was seeing dollar signs more than anything. That could be just me though."
breakingbad,35eudx,JD_1994_,8,Sun May 10 11:52:39 2015 UTC,"I felt the same. Part of me feels like not only did she see dollar signs, but also a seemingly unlimited supply of heroin. For people addicted to drugs like heroin or meth, it is almost all they think about. When will I be able to use again? What can I do do get more meth/heroin? While I'm sure that her actions were partly because of seeing dollar signs, I feel that thinking about how much heroin they would be able to buy with that money was a much bigger part of it."
breakingbad,35eudx,jorshbalardo,3,Sun May 10 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"^ that exactly. I felt like a part of her really wanted to get off the heroin, but that at that moment she was just too addicted to even be able to quit on her own, even if she tried. If she would have fled with Jesse and a whole bag of money, my guess would be they'd try start up a new life, but due the lure of the heroin waste all the money and eventually waste their lives. I just cared too much about Jesse to NOT care about that happening. I personally think the only way Jane could ever have gotten off the heroin was by rehab and therapy and all."
breakingbad,35eudx,ErikEzrin,2,Sun May 10 04:19:19 2015 UTC,"I think they just had her disagree with Walt so he could let her die. The majority of her scenes are positive, both on the show and Jesse. She was simply a plot device to show how territorial Walt had become over his money, product, business and Jesse. It was the spiral that sent Jesse into a tailspin, possibly forever, until Walt told Jesse in Ozymandias.  Part of me thinks Walt telling Jesse he watched Jane die was his way of looking on the surface like he was hurting Jesse but letting him know all the bad was Walt's doing, and Jesse shouldn't feel guilty about it. And that by telling him that, he would be coming back for him, too, and to avenge Hank's, murder also. There was still allusions to their partnership after that, mostly just before the final finale shootout.   And I don't buy Jesse being stupid. He came up with a lot of ideas, namely the final one getting Walt to confess, lead them to his money and get arrested (before the Nazi shootout) all in one trick. That was on par with any plan Walt thought up."
breakingbad,35eudx,zbo2amt,2,Sun May 10 07:12:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I guess I sympathized with her a lot more than most. I got a sense that she realized how much Walt was taking advantage of and using Jessie for his own personal gain and she tried to separate him from that. I don't know but that's how I saw it although I could have been blinded a bit by my pure hatred for Walt and the amount of damage he caused to every single person close to him."
breakingbad,35eudx,SouthrnComfort,2,Mon May 18 04:25:22 2015 UTC,She was a drug addict trying to stop doing drugs. The only way an addict can visualize a life without getting high is to make a major life change. They believe a big move will allow them to start over.

And how can Skyler even tell the whole story, since she is involved. Walt Jr. now believes (just like the cops due that phone call before Walt went to New Hampshire) that his mom was forced into it at gunpoint, practically. If he hears she consciously chose to launder his money (she could have divorced him) and be an accessory in his fathers crimes, I'm not sure if that will help him..."
breakingbad,35eudx,buywhizzobutter,2,Sun May 10 01:28:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sure her involvement would come out (he didn't buy the car wash without her running the books and that's pretty obvious) but she uses the token of the bodies location to get out of jail (debatable as to whether that would work in real life). But all that aside, let's say it wouldn't come out; she probably wouldn't say anything about her involvement and I highly doubt Jr. would ever fully forgive his father but I can't imagine Skylar, knowing Walt did it all for his family and wasn't the one who killed Hank, could let her son hate Walt for his whole life over the false belief he murdered his uncle.  The rest of it, I doubt he'd forgive him on, but I think he didn't hate him with a passion over any of that news, he hated him for having killed uncle Hank."
breakingbad,35eudx,ErikEzrin,2,Sun May 10 07:39:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I at least hope Skyler gets away with it. I think she does... especially since that phone call Walt made on the day he left. They will discover she's involved, but since they have that particularly poisonous phone call she can shove it on ""He's a monster, he forced me, he'd have killed me and my son and daughter"" and if she then uses the token as leverage I think they can keep her out of jail.  But yeah, no... don't think she can ever tell the full truth to her son, thus she will always have to carry the weight of the fact that Walt Jr. hates his dad for something he never did, and Walt Jr. will always be scarred by the fact that the man he trusted and eventually even admired turned out to be a total 'monster'."

They can find his fingerprints and such, see he's in albequerque, dead n all... I think she can get away with it. I sure hope so, because Walt Jr. wouldn't survive his mom also being torn down."
breakingbad,35eudx,passwordiscan123,16,Sun May 10 22:43:38 2015 UTC,Walt did kill Hank. Just not directly
breakingbad,35eudx,DrMopinker,21,Mon May 11 06:37:20 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but based on his phone call with Walt Jr., the poor kid never made that distinction."
breakingbad,35eudx,ErikEzrin,6,Sun May 10 01:26:03 2015 UTC,"He caused his death, yeah, but at the spot he tried everything to stop it. He literally begged and pleaded Jack not to kill Hank, even offering him ALL of his money. Not 10 million, not 40 million, no, the FULL 80 million, even though Hank would get him imprisoned and killing him would mean escape. He was just as sad about his death as Marie, Skyler and Walt Jr. were, and his son will forever think he shot him in cold blood (like he claimed in that ploy call to Skyler)."
breakingbad,35eudx,Phea1Mike,7,Sun May 10 01:33:35 2015 UTC,"He literally begged and pleaded Jack not to kill Hank, even offering him ALL of his money.   Yes, Walt was the very definition of, ""living in denial"". He never fully realized that he had become a very nasty version of the thing he feared most; his family being hurt.   ""Mr. White"" caught just a glimpse of that reality and the true nature of the nightmare world, ""Heisenberg"" had created. He had a moment of clarity, a gut reaction, and tried desperately, to save Hank.   He caught another glimpse when he had to face the truth about Jessie's situation, but he was able to save him. I know the writers spent countless hours, days, deciding  on the ending.   The only thing I might have done differently, would have been a very short scene with Flinn, simply opening a letter from his dad, and maybe crying, leaving the contents of the letter up to the viewer to decide, much like Jessie's fate.  However, that wasn't to be, which is in part, why he was the character I felt the worst for. That poor kid got totally fucked over,  without a shred of closure."
breakingbad,35eudx,ErikEzrin,3,Sun May 10 07:34:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah indeed... only think speaking in favour of Walt Jr./Flynn is that Walt made sure HE will get those 7 million from the Schwarzes. Not Skyler, but his own son. Maybe he did that out of guilt, because I am sure Walt realizes what we know as well: that Flynn will forever hate his father. And thus he feels he should get it directly to his son, even though he will never know it came from him... (and that's good, cause otherwise he wouldn't take it) But mental and emotional closure... he gets none of that. No amount of money can mend the wounds of the soul."
breakingbad,35eudx,bobthebobd,1 point,Sun May 10 11:32:10 2015 UTC,"I blame Hank doing his job, for killing Hank. He could have stopped his investigation as his superiors told him to. He also could have backed off when he realised his soon to be dead and no longer making meth brother in law was the culprit all along.  I think Hank and Walt are quiet similar, they don't take things very personally and they both like to take charge of any situation. They just can't let it play out without forcing their will onto it."
breakingbad,35eudx,Systm9,2,Sun May 10 11:41:58 2015 UTC,"Hank and Walt are quiet similar, they don't take things very personally   What do you mean by this?"
breakingbad,35eudx,ErikEzrin,4,Sun May 10 12:17:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for him too... especially because he's like... the ONLY entirely innocent character in the series (even Gale wasn't entirely innocent, he was a meth cook after all)."
breakingbad,35eudx,ErikEzrin,18,Sun May 10 17:02:08 2015 UTC,"OMG! I totally forgot about Walts mom... she's just mentioned once 'n all... but now I read this, wow. Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for her. He didn't even tell her he had cancer, or speak with her before he died. And then he's suddenly dead and she finds out what horrible stuff her previously 'meek' son has been up to."
breakingbad,35eudx,mattzach84,8,Sun May 10 07:35:42 2015 UTC,"She's mentioned more than once; besides the ""trip"" during Four Days Out, there was talk of asking her for money previously in the season.  I always had the impression that Walt and his mother were estranged, or that Skylar and she did not get along."
breakingbad,35eudx,JimmyHavok,5,Sat May 9 20:48:08 2015 UTC,Skylar and she did not get along.   That would explain why Walt thought he could conceal his meth cook by saying he went to see her.
breakingbad,35eudx,DabuSurvivor,2,Sat May 9 22:39:36 2015 UTC,"From mother's love is the son estranged  Married his own, his precious gain!  The earth will shake! - in two will break!  And death all around will be your dowry!"

breakingbad,35eudx,DabuSurvivor,2,Sun May 10 06:38:37 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think it's pretty reminiscent of Walt. We could infer - as the person I'm replying to did - that he's estranged from his mother; he pretty clearly becomes married to his work, with the meth and its production as his true love (""Take My True Love By Her Hand"", ""El Paso"", Baby Blue""); the following two lines are a pretty concise description of how much everything goes down in flames and rips apart as a result as the series goes on."
breakingbad,35eudx,fruitscrolllup,7,Sun May 10 09:20:41 2015 UTC,"Specifically because he didn't care to tell her about his cancer, only mentioned her once in the show while creating an excuse to cook all weekend, and we never see her at all, I'm guessing they didn't have a close relationship, or a relationship at all."
breakingbad,35eudx,Melwing,6,Sun May 10 09:37:58 2015 UTC,"A mother would still be incredibly shocked, saddened, and potentially destroyed when she heard about all Walt's shit."
breakingbad,35eudx,fruitscrolllup,4,Sat May 9 21:50:23 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the mother, who we know nothing about."
breakingbad,35eudx,Melwing,4,Sun May 10 03:31:21 2015 UTC,"Skylar was surprised and upset that Walt hadn't told his mother about the cancer yet, so yeah, I think we can safely (and rightfully IMO) assume that there was at least a bit of a relationship. Otherwise Skylar wouldn't have been surprised whatsoever, eh?"
breakingbad,35eudx,fruitscrolllup,6,Sun May 10 04:46:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry but you're just wrong. Go back and watch the scene, a bit less than 5 minutes into S2E9.  Skylar proposes a weekend thing, and Walt says he thinks he should go see his mother. She's surprised by that. When Walt says he never did call her, Skylar is neither surprised or shocked, and immediately changes the subject to what he thinks the test results will be.  Pretty obvious to anyone who revisits the scene that Walt most likely has a non-relationship with his mother."
breakingbad,35eudx,thisishardcore_,4,Sun May 10 05:32:55 2015 UTC,"I always thought Marie had the saddest ending. Apart from Walt Jr. she was the most innocent character, and I know she wasn't a fan favourite, but she didn't deserve to have her life ruined like that.  It's apparent in Felina that her and Skyler hadn't spoken since the events of Ozymandias all those months prior. Obviously Skyler and Walt Jr's lives had been ruined as well, but at least they had each other for company and solidarity. Whereas Marie was obviously a very lonely woman at the end of Breaking Bad and there's just something so sad about that, because she didn't bring any of it on herself, it just happened to her."
breakingbad,35eudx,Luciferspants,0,Sun May 10 05:37:03 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I feel bad for every character. Everyone likes to hate on Walt, but he seems like he was an ideal father figure before he got cancer. He cared and and loved his family so much, and it wasn't until he knew he was going to die that he acted up. I'm not saying all of his actions were justified, but it doesn't stop me from feeling sympathy for him."
breakingbad,35eudx,onetruepurple,2,Sun May 10 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you were downvoted...  But I agree with you that pretty much every character got dealt with a shitty hand by the end of the series. Walter just simply wanted to provide for his family. While his ego led him down to creating a meth empire, he still had nothing but love for his family.  He truly did love them, even Hank. Not once in the entire series did Walter want Hank to be killed, even when Hank found out about him being Heisenberg, he still vehemently fought against that option because he viewed him as family.   Walt's love for his family is why I could never call him evil, and I feel nothing but sympathy for him."
breakingbad,35eudx,onetruepurple,1 point,Sun May 10 17:36:01 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Like I said in my comment, his actions weren't all justified, but to say everything he did was selfish is a huge overstatement."

breakingbad,35eudx,Rayneworks,3,Sun May 10 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"This always struck me as a completely stupid lie. If you're going to lie about something so huge, then At least tell a lie that Skylar can't check up on. All it took was one phone call to check for the truth and it was all over.  Such a hugely obvious blunder."
breakingbad,35eudx,TehJellyfish,3,Sun May 10 23:27:10 2015 UTC,"It sure looked like Skyler wasn't on good terms with Walt's mother. So it makes sense that Skyler would never find out, and Walt needed an excuse Skyler couldn't say no to."
breakingbad,35eudx,bwaredapenguin,1 point,Sun May 10 06:57:30 2015 UTC,"In the first season Skylar makes an off hand comment while discussing walt's treatment.  Something along the lines of ""You weren't raised to ask for help."" It's a tiny line but it's the only insight we have into the way walt was raised. Maybe he didn't have very good parents."
breakingbad,35eudx,slowfreq,1 point,Sun May 10 12:05:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't get that feeling. She says ""Maybe it was the way you were raised"" which 1) means she isn't sure, and 2) being raised not to accept charity and pity doesn't mean you had bad parents. If I were dying of cancer and two of my old friends offered to pay my treatment, I'd feel very uncomfortable accepting it. I probably would in the end, but that doesn't mean his parents were bad just because he denied it."
breakingbad,35eudx,Slenderauss,-1,Fri May 29 13:14:34 2015 UTC,You feel worse about Walt's mom than Brock?
breakingbad,35eudx,tipper_,-16,Fri May 29 14:00:13 2015 UTC,"She was probably abusive as fuck. Just from what I can determine from the show, she never praised Walter for anything. Everything he did was ""Adequate"", and nothing more. She generally ignored him, and very likely threw him out of the house the moment he hit 18. This is seen in his pride, his unquenchable desire to be the best and only of his kind. He's finally good at something, people acknowledge his skill, even if those people are the scum of the earth. He's finally appreciated.  Edit: Guys, this is simple shit here. It doesn't take a psychology degree to figure it out. People don't straight-up abandon their mothers unless they were abusive."

breakingbad,35eudx,Rayneworks,0,Sun May 10 02:40:25 2015 UTC,Okay.
breakingbad,35eudx,gwarster,2,Sun May 10 02:44:39 2015 UTC,"I half-agree, half-disagree.  This is Walter we're talking about, who walked out on Gretchen for clearly very stupid reasons (4th question in interview).  He's incredibly proud, so much so that it can cause him to be irrational.  Sure, he doesn't see his mother, but the dude can hold a grudge over some dumb shit... Clearly him and his mother didn't have a good relationship and he's harbouring some sort of resentment, but if I were a betting man, it's something Walt should have been able to get over after enough time had passed if his giant ego wasn't standing in the way of proper reconciliation (much like the Gretchen/Elliott thing).  I wouldn't let his mom completely off the hook - she was probably far from perfect.  I wouldn't be surprised if the type of relationship they had was reasonably close to what you described - at least, in terms of how Walt remembers it.  But how Walt remembers things and how she remembers things may be very different from each other (again, like the Gretchen/Elliott thing) and at least some of that resentment is probably unfounded.  The fact that they are still have a non-relationship is probably as much on Walt as it is on her.  This is all, of course, complete speculation though.  There's really little to draw from, and it's been a while since I saw the show."

breakingbad,35j0io,Regret_Rookie,-5,Sun May 10 21:24:24 2015 UTC,"From what I remember he was embezzling money from his company. Which is taking money that the company owned as his owned.

breakingbad,35elyw,ErikEzrin,32,Sat May 9 16:25:14 2015 UTC,"Walt knows that Lydia is all about routine and control. She sits in the same place at the coffee shop and always has him meet her at the same time. Walt uses this to exploit her: he sets it up so that everything she does is completely in sync with what she ALWAYS does, so there is no suspicion of foul play on his part until it is far too late"
breakingbad,35elyw,natehaskey,8,Sat May 9 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"This is also why she's such a bad criminal. A good criminal would arrange her meetings at random times and in random places. But Lydia's priority is making HERSELF feel safe, and routine is comforting for her, even if, as we see, being so predictable actually puts her in danger.   We won't ever know how Walt re-sealed the packet after he switched out the stevia with the ricin. But the rest is easy: he removed all of the other packets right before Todd got there, then he sat at the bar and waited. I imagine if someone who wasn't Lydia had sat down and gone for the packet, he would have been there to stop them. He only had the one dose and he wasn't going to loose it on a bystander."
breakingbad,35elyw,IdiotsLantern,2,Sat May 9 21:00:02 2015 UTC,He probably just used a little dot of glue and she didn't have any reason to notice it.

Thanks :P I just didn't know for sure if she ALWAYS chooses the same place and time in the coffee shop, but now you say so... you're correct. In the end her desire for control became her downfall. So ironic..."
breakingbad,35elyw,bryondouglas,11,Sat May 9 16:32:58 2015 UTC,"Also, there was only 1 packet of Stevia. If I remember correctly she even asks the server for more. Walt thereby ensured she would use that specific packet"
breakingbad,35elyw,BaconCat42,11,Sat May 9 19:32:10 2015 UTC,Walt knew that Lydia did her meetings in the same spot at the same time and place every time. He also knew that she only puts Stevia in her tea. So knowing that it was pretty easy for Walt to poison her.
breakingbad,35elyw,SpiderTechnitian,2,Sat May 9 16:30:44 2015 UTC,"I thought you question was also asking how he physically got the ricin in the packet, and I have no idea. I know if I was her I wouldn't use some random opened packet, I'd like bitch at the employees and ask for a new one."
breakingbad,35elyw,SpiderTechnitian,2,Sun May 10 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"Well, my guess is he maybe had a syringe or a needle of sorts. The ricin appears to be a very fine powder, so it would fit through a bigger gauge needle I think. This would just leave a tiny hole in the packet, probably gone unnoticed by Lydia. Also, the packet wasn't open. I'm pretty sure she opens it right on screen."
breakingbad,35elyw,GetOffMyLawn_,2,Sun May 10 06:57:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was thinking about how he closed it, but I had totally forgotten how fine ricin is. That's pretty likely; thank you!"

I think it's a fair enough test as some of the questions seemed like they would sway towards Jesse (particularly the kids questions) and I didn't choose them, but I do agree that I'm too introspective and unsure about my ~place in life a lot. Not bad at all. :)"
breakingbad,35ds2b,Spotinella,2,Sat May 9 11:25:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. I also thought at first ""OH I GOT THIS! This question will totally get you Walt/Hank/Jesse/etc."" and I didn't choose those (like for instance the ""does the world owe you or do you owe the world?"" question, the ""The world owes me big"" answer is clearly directed towards Walt, and I didn't choose that one)  So far the best test I found. As most other ones are either totally random (Buzzfeed) or blatantly ask you if you'd kill someone, or ask ""how evil are you on a scale from 1-9"". I think most of us don't consider ourselves to be 'evil' or like we'd kill someone. I sure don't."

See I thought of something like an inflatable object of some sort or like a scissor jack on the other side of the pole under the bike lock. I don't know why but the idea just bubbled up and because it was creepy and scary it grabbed onto some part of my brain and fed it nightmare fuel. So then I thought about it being like an automated gizmo, like some Saw type bullshit with a little timer, a thick rubber inflatable bit, and a CO2 canister.  At this point I'm like, ""No brain! You have betrayed me!"" and my own damn skin feels like it's choking me a little. My brain knows I'm its bitch though and starts thinking of ways to make this incredibly evil device tamper proof, using my creeped out-ness as a sort of hypothetical test subject. So some part of my brain is thinking of how to defeat the device and another evil bit is thinking of how to prevent that escape.  Yeah.

There is a scene where the plate drops and breaks around the man held captive who around the same time appeals to his sympathy.   He almost lets him loose but then something occurs to him.  He reassembeles the broken plate to see if there are any missing pieces.  When the place is reconstructed to look like a shank was taken from thr ground (missing piece) the main actor breaks into tears because he knows he has to go down to the basement and finish off the tied up man (FIRST BLOOD!)  /story

I lived the farm life outside a smalll town for quite a while. It took me a while to 'catch up' on some popular shows. I still havent seen some. Imo spoilers should always be tagged.

When Walt morphs into Heisenberg, he uses his brilliance, his 'magic' as Skyler calls it (""I don't have any of your magic, Walt"" 504) in the game. Walt applies his objective genius to pave his road to empire. This is compounded by his stunted development and unrealized potential along with Walt's bombastic view of what a kingpin is supposed to be (this is really the motif of season 5A) and comparing himself more and more to Gus Fring. To a point, that in 509 Blood Money Walt had really reached Fring's high watermark. Walt, while helping Lydia at the car wash behaved exactly like Gus in Pollos Hermanos. Walt had more money than he needed, he could rest on his laurels and 'hide in plain sight' in a legitimate family business that also is a laundering front. Sounds like Gustavo. Later on in 509 as Walt is kneeling down to throw up from the chemo, he folds and lays down a towel for his knees like Gus in 410 Salud.  Sorry about that sidebar, I could write about this fucking show forever.

Him being a chemistry genius and able to produce really pure meth and do stuff like throwing around phosphor in Tuco's residence and isolating ricine is part of his character, but imo it is given pretty much from the get go. Stuff like the Gustavo killing, the prison killings, the train heist and pulling off the mobile meth lab disguised as pest exterminators is some criminal genius stuff right there, and we have 4 seasons to watch Walt to get to a point where he can plan and do those."

Jesse is respectful, tries to get a conversation going, and is thankful for the food. Walt is just actively trying to aggravate his wife, and Skylar is just resentful towards the entire situation.

Its so much harder to execute a series thats so rooted in social commentary without coming off preachy or unrealistic, than it is to execute a character piece. The Wire and BB are equal on terms of execution (A+ on both counts), but I think The Wire had loftier goals from the get-go. It made crime drama real--and it's a genre that's mostly defined by CSI and law & order so thats a pretty impressive accomplishment to my mind.  its probably unfair to compare them but you know, he said Greatest Show of All Time so if you made me pick.."

breakingbad,34hsb9,Phea1Mike,7,Fri May 1 07:06:33 2015 UTC,Classic Scarface.
breakingbad,34hsb9,KBtheSkeptic,7,Fri May 1 07:26:22 2015 UTC,They even show a small part of Scarface I think somewhere in season 5 on TV.
breakingbad,34hsb9,DaKickass,5,Fri May 1 12:15:57 2015 UTC,Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood is also fairly similar.
breakingbad,34hsb9,PhotonicBoom21,5,Fri May 1 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"The mini series Fargo , the main characters journey has uncanny resemblances to walter whites story , just my opinion"

breakingbad,34hsb9,Natezami,2,Tue May 5 19:08:17 2015 UTC,It was all for himself like Walt admits in the last meeting with skyler. The main character in Fargo was weak at the start and transformed into a almost villain like character and self obsessed like Walt and his urge for a meth empire taking out anyone in his path
breakingbad,34hsb9,No-half-measures-abq,2,Tue May 5 22:43:42 2015 UTC,"Yea I get that; they are very similar in that way. But what I'm asking is what was the ""catalyst""? For Walt it was the cancer and not wanting to leave debt, but in Fargo was it just him feeling immasculated?"
breakingbad,34hsb9,Natezami,2,Tue May 5 22:45:48 2015 UTC,"Hamlet.   By the end he has very arguably not followed his father's ghost's command to ""taint not thy mind""."

breakingbad,34hq4j,JuniorBreak,5,Fri May 1 06:35:03 2015 UTC,"i remember walt saying ""learn to take yes for an answer"" to lydia after mike said it to him in the bar scene"
breakingbad,34hq4j,slowfreq,3,Sat May 2 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"As a resident of Albuquerque I can say that ""beaucoup bucks"" is not a common phrase.. I'd never heard it before.."
breakingbad,34hq4j,Slayer128,3,Fri May 1 09:29:35 2015 UTC,"Both Tuco and Lydia tell Walter ""we're going to make a lot of money together."""
breakingbad,34hq4j,bluestrol,2,Fri May 1 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"""Are you mad-dogging them, Tio? [Tuco laughs.] What, you don't like them?"" - Tuco  ""Combo rang me before it went down. Said dudes were mad-dogging him, trying to run him up off the corner."" - Skinny Pete  I guess they developed the same vocab in their time served at Los Lunas."

breakingbad,34hq4j,seahorsekiller,2,Fri May 1 13:50:54 2015 UTC,"Throughout the series the term ""duly noted"" comes up- just often enough that it sticks out. Characters using the term (from the top of my head) include, I believe, Walt, Mike, Ted, and Howard Hamlin from Better Call Saul."
breakingbad,34hq4j,dimplepinch,2,Fri May 1 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"""Look at me"" said by Gus on more than one occasion and later by Mike in regards to Lydia.  ""All this to say..."" is a popular one I've noticed that the writers use to sorta sum up ideas. I'm pretty sure that's a part of Vince Gilligan's nomenclature.  ""I'm the bad guy"" said by Jesse in 301 and later by Walt to Saul ""I'm not the bad guy.""  ""It's us or them"" or some variation on that line has been used multiple times. First I believe used by Jesse when he takes out the gun as the option to take care of Krazy 8. Then in 313 Full Measure when Walt floats the idea of rubbing Gale out to Jesse in Lazerbase. Then again in 401 Box Cutter in Walt's desperate justification to Gus in the superlab. And I think finally in 506 when Todd is pleading his case to Jesse, Walt and Mike.  There are many others but that's just off the top."

breakingbad,34e9i3,Seksuaali,5,Thu Apr 30 13:05:09 2015 UTC,"At the very start of the show, he struck me as a delinquent type. Had a bit of an attitude, had a pretty ignorant attitude towards science, was more interested in taking drugs.  A lot of people like that have untapped potential that they never fulfil."
breakingbad,34e9i3,thisishardcore_,4,Thu Apr 30 18:45:30 2015 UTC,What comes to mind is the scene where badger and skinny pete are in the music store to buy the cases for the lab and skinny pete is playing the most beautiful music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_974ZusIvhk
breakingbad,34e9i3,Monst3rr,1 point,Fri May 1 06:34:57 2015 UTC,I always felt skinny Petes character should have had a bigger role in the series. Couldn't tell ya when and where he could've fit in but they merged Mike pretty well in there even though he started as a somewhat minor character
breakingbad,34e9i3,SilentAngel,1 point,Sat May 9 05:45:48 2015 UTC,Yeah... I'm gonna need a link.
