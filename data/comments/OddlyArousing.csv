OddlyArousing,3d6qa4,LifelessMC,5,Mon Jul 13 23:21:42 2015 UTC,Seeing this makes me have a question though what is the system that powers these type motions and the other electrical functions. On a car you have an alternator that converts the mechanical energy from the motor into electricity which is stored in the battery and in turn used throughout the car. Do jets and other advanced craft such as the space shuttles have similar systems?
OddlyArousing,3d6qa4,kickin-chicken,3,Tue Jul 14 05:01:56 2015 UTC,"There's almost always a generator driven off the either the main shaft that the compressor is driven off of, or sometimes a separate turbine is used to drive accessory components. If you have a spinning shaft its fairly simple then to generate a magnetic flux, which in turn generates a voltage and thus a current."
OddlyArousing,3d6qa4,R134a,2,Sun Jul 19 17:58:12 2015 UTC,Would that be in line with the main shaft or come off to the side?
OddlyArousing,3d6qa4,kickin-chicken,2,Sun Jul 19 23:44:30 2015 UTC,"Usually the main drive shaft is spinning too fast for a generator givent the frequency you require from it, i.e. 50hz in the US, 60hz elsewhere, or like 400hz in aircraft. That frequency generated in cycles/second is interchangeable with RPM of the shaft driving it. So to that end there has to be some kind of gear box that steps down the RPM to the appropriate frequency for the power you want to generate. Physically you can connect a gear box to either the end of the compressor shaft, or have something like a bevel gear on a shaft so you can have the gearbox down and out of the way."
OddlyArousing,3d6qa4,R134a,4,Mon Jul 20 18:13:41 2015 UTC,This doesn't arouse me so much as hypnotize and/or comfort me.   Weird.   I like it.

OddlyArousing,32rj5f,Kongo204,9,Thu Apr 16 07:15:27 2015 UTC,"Anyone know what they ""say"" while signing? Is the mouth part of the sign language or do they speak what they are signing?  I always see them with such contorted faces with some is expressions and wonder."
OddlyArousing,32rj5f,Money_on_the_table,10,Thu Apr 16 08:34:50 2015 UTC,As far as I know the facial expressions are a crucial part of sign language. In addition interpreters usually mouth the words very clearly so the words can be more easily read off their lips as well.
OddlyArousing,32rj5f,DrPantaleon,9,Sun Apr 19 00:19:12 2015 UTC,They're usually mouthing the words as they translate. It helps you keep your place and separates what you're signing from what you're listening to.
