wine,3e4swr,brokenzion410,7,Tue Jul 21 23:25:42 2015 UTC,"This video really upsets me:   This video is barely about chemistry or enology. Sure, they listed a few categories of molecules that impact wine but that's about it. And then they say that wine is shaped by soil, climate, etc, but that's not really a scientific discussion either. They didn't say anything along the lines of condition A leads to molecule B which leads to effect C. This video leads off terribly: ""Sorry high-rollers, but no matter how much you paid for it, a bottle of wine is about 98% water and ethanol""... This statement was so irritating! SO what if the characteristic part of wine is only 2% of its content by volume? The human nose can distinguish certain aroma molecules at the ppb and ppt levels - that's parts per billion/trillion, aka 0.00000001% This video does such a terrible job of reflecting how much we know about wine (not to say that there's not an incredible amount left to understand). The tone is so ... careless. As if this industry isn't incredibly developed and incredibly high tech. We've known about some of the stuff they mentioned in this video for decades; that green bell aroma? Isobutylmethoxypyrazine. We've known about it for at least three decades. Also, we can perceive it at 2 parts per trillion level.   Fuck this video.   Sincerely,  an irate analytical chemist"

wine,3e5qgf,noblecustom,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:04:25 2015 UTC,"I used to be a member of Sanford and have one or two bottles left, we opened this one tonight, I think I paid around $28 or so for it with the member discount as it retails in the mid $30 range from what I recall. One of the employees told me that they used to sell all their viognier grapes to another winemaker but in 2012 she didn't order as much as she used to so they decided to bottle some of their own.  Nose - I get a lot of chardonnay characteristics from this, you can detect the oak, it needed some more time to open up to be honest, it seemed a little tight. I got some pear/melon/grapefruit hints, a little caramel/butterscotch like a chard, not a bad nose.  Palate - Chard nuances coming through again for me, a bit of the acid shows up, mineral and citrus mouth feel. I feel like this might pair well with Thai food but I am a total novice at pairings so take that with a grain of salt.   It is definitely a pleasant wine but when rating it I have to take into consideration not only the taste but the price and at $30+ this knocks some points of for me, I would give this wine an 86/100. I enjoyed it but don't feel that I would ever buy it again to be honest with you.  I just feel there is better bang for your buck out there and if I am going to spend $28-33 on a bottle, I would be picking up Blindfold over this."

wine,3e2szp,Oldpenguinhunter,5,Tue Jul 21 14:58:32 2015 UTC,"I popped this last night on a whim- I picked the wine up at a local wine store, they had absorbed someone's cellar and this just happened to be one of the bottles for sale.  I know little-to-nothing about the winery; as far as I can tell, the winery is now a producer working with Trader Joe's and doesn't really produce wines like this anymore.  Anyway...  The ullage was at low-neck, a little bin staining on the labels (and peeling off...), the cork was fully saturated.  The cork came out in two pieces, and in two attempts.  The aroma of the wine was very youthful, sweet floral notes, luxardo cherry syrup, black cherry, and black plum on the nose- I kept thinking to myself: ""Is this really 30 years old?!""  The wine looks a little old, with moderate bricking around the edges of the wine.  Taste echoed the aroma, with the luxardo cherry syrup being the most note worthy, the tannins were still prevalent- and added a plum skin like tartness to the wine.  I would have never guessed this wine to be 30 years old.  Impressive.   EDIT:  I did have a chance to look into the winery some more.  The winery was first started up by Bronco (Two-Buck Chuck) with an eye on ""super-premium wines"".  This was only pursued for a few years and by very late 1980's, Bronco shifted towards more affordable wines (cheap plonk)."

Maybe get a couple scratch-offs before you head over there to see if you can bulk up that budget.  Oh well.    Personally, my tastes are pretty simple, and I always feel bad spending too much on a single bottle.  So I would probably do a couple of more affordable wines.  It is nice that they do half-bottles and have a sick BTG offering.  I like easy-drinking, crisp wines.  How about some Rose?  I know I love the Red Car, or maybe that sparkling Alsatian to start off.  Then (especially if you know somebody else is going to get big reds that you may be able to take a small pour of) I would get some Chablis or that Sandhi Chard. to drink with the steaks.  It would be neat to show people a different perspective on pairing without investing too much money.  Contrast can be as interesting, if not moreso, than complement.  Then I would do some Amari with dessert, because I love that shit.    Of course, I would LOVE to do some flights of the different vintages of Bordeaux, Burgundy, even Napa, but that would cost a few thousand at least.

DO NOT do THAT THING that every single goddam business party seems to do where you order a monster Cab from Napa and then have shrimp cocktail. God that irks me. So yeah, The Burgundy to start with or (and I'm surmised I'm saying it) just get the friggin' Veuve Cliquot. You're celebrating after all, and everyone will actually know what that is! With dinner try the Aalto Ribera del Duero, it's within your comfortable range and is really an amazing wine that not many people know about. It has some serious muscle so will match steaks or lamb or whatever heartier stuff you guys order for dinner. If that's too out there for ha, a Chianti is a happy middle ground and is both delicious and pairs well with most cuisine. I hope this reaches you in time and is helpful! Congrats to you!"

From the back of some guys closet, I think perhaps halving the above would be a good expectation.

wine,3e2z2o,Socrates5150,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:42 2015 UTC,Didn't know about wine searcher. None of these are in perfect condition although some look better than others. Even as a non-wine person I am confident none of them would sell for near the full price. I just wonder if perfect is $700 then is there still any value in bottles that are less than perfect.   I have no desire to keep these bottles but since there are about 16 of them I suspect it might be best to find a wine broker and just take whatever they will give me for the lot. Does anybody have other thoughts?
wine,3e2z2o,smutsmutsmut,3,Tue Jul 21 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"Here's what you have to consider:  $700 is the price of replacement. That's what it would cost you in a store, right now, to buy the same bottle.  For you, to sell it, it's different. You probably have to take your bottles to an auction house or a licensed retailer. They will see that the bottles are not in good shape and have less than perfect provenance. That's the first discount. Then they'll offer you a lot less of the actual retail price because they have to make a profit. On top of that, there might be consignment fees and other charges.   At that point, you're better off drinking it."
wine,3e2z2o,Socrates5150,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:11 2015 UTC,I hardly ever drink wine. I realize that any wine broker person would need to make a profit so I would expect to sell them at much less than their already less than perfect price. I am fine with that. I just don't care to own them or drink them so its either sell them or dump them. I thank you and all others for the feedback so far. I added some pics but I just want to make sure if somebody offers me a lowball I don't stupidly sell a gem for pennies and not being a wine person I fear that will happen.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest it was a '13 or '14, fruit bomb, low on oak. The style is typical of the 10-20 price range. Since you said nothing about pepper, I'd guess it was Clare Valley. The Taylor's '14 is very purple with decent fruit, not very complex. Wines on this level are designed to be quaffed, not stored, so acidity and tannins are low and flavour is very upfront. They're simple and approachable.   But that's just a guess, I could be way off.  Easiest way to work it out is to find out where you got it from, go back there and try and find the label. Then we can help you find similar wines :)"

If its a deep purple wine that is bold and mature you are just going to have to try a lot of both syrah and shiraz in order to find out what you like. As you begin to explore the world of wine you will develop an eye for what you enjoy. Your are going to have a hard time finding the exact bottle. but hopefully this helped you find something that you will enjoy.

There's a price point, not so high, where quality is markedly improved. Usually, that's a little above the huge ubiquitous supermarket labels.  Over here, that's 20$ or so. I hear booze is pricey (and heavily taxed) down under so it might be a few more dollars."

wine,3e333w,CondorKhan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:15 2015 UTC,Great! Thank you
wine,3e333w,occasionallyrude,3,Tue Jul 21 16:33:40 2015 UTC,I would caution against listening too much to what other bozos on the web tell you about drink dates.  It's not an exact science.... Nobody knows for sure. We all have different preferences as to when is the perfect time for drinking. To a large extent the rate of 'maturation' varies anyway with things like storage temperature.   There is no substitute for cracking open a bottle yourself and having a test. Personally I'd rather drink a bottle a year of something on it's way up rather than overshoot and end up with a case past its best.
wine,3e333w,jstanderulo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:23:34 2015 UTC,"If you really want to be able to tell for yourself rather than a website, you can try a Corovin. Its basically a hypodermic needle that creates a incredibly small hole through the cork (without compromising it). It snatches up some wine and leaves argon gas so the wine doesn't oxidize. In my experience its an amazing piece of equipment. Only issue is its like 300 bucks."
wine,3e333w,Socrates5150,2,Tue Jul 21 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"And it only works with natural corks. And once you inject Argon the bottle will no longer develop as there is no Oxygen in the bottle. Or am I wrong about that? Does the Coravin leave a small traces of O2 allowing the wine to continue to develop?  I love the idea of the Coravin as well, but only as a means of preserving the wine to drink not to test it's place in the aging process."
wine,3e333w,jstanderulo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:07 2015 UTC,"A wine made of a conglomerate cork wouldn't be worth convining. Haha I have never tried. You have a  valid point about the oxygen. But the O2 in the bottle has already reacted with the wine. The way a wine develops is because small amounts of O2 leak into the bottle through the cork. That's why leaky corks are such a problem. In my very limited experience with a corovin (a friend had used one on a bottle 10 months prior,  and we opened an identical bottle to try them side by side) it worked well. But argon is heavier than oxygen so I'd be inclined to day say you are right because argon won't want to leave and let oxygen back into the bottle."

wine,3e2186,Ozstriker,7,Tue Jul 21 10:18:09 2015 UTC,"Well, tannins, acidity, sugar, and some say alcohol content can help preserve a wine, but not all wines with high levels of these traits are worth cellaring. Quality of fruit is a huge component to the potential benefits of aging. You can take the fruit that goes into a bottle of Meomi Pinot Noir and put it in new oak for 2 years and have a powerful wine with high tannin, but aging it with inevitably give you a wine that tastes like wood for a long time after the fruit has faded away. Good fruit is your starting point. Research and find producers who are known for the quality of their fruit and then look at the ""structure"" (acidity, tannins, sugar, etc) of the wine to see if there is enough of one or the other and it is in good balance with the fruit of the wine. Bordeaux varietals, Burgundy Pinot Noir, Piedmont Nebbiolo, and German Riesling are classic examples of this, but there are others such as high quality Muscadet, or Loire Valley Chenin Blanc which can not only age, but because of the quality of their fruit will actually develop secondary or tertiary flavors with bottle age.   In the end it's a very complicated question with no quick answer, but a good rule of thumb is high quality fruit with a good balance of tannin, acidity, sugar or a combination there of is a good starting point. From there only time will tell if the wine improves with cellaring...and very few will."

wine,3e0i5h,nerdcloset,6,Tue Jul 21 00:40:43 2015 UTC,"I'd be curious about what other films you have heard it compared to.   I think a lot of it was showing some of the absurdity of the wine industry as a luxury product. Essentially you have one consultant, who may prefer a wine of a certain style, and that style may coincide with the style preferred by one of the most influential critics. Now you have people with money who want to make wine, and want it to score well, and sell well, so you hire the guy, and get reviews from the other guy and all is well. The Silver Oak aspect covers the infancy of the wine consumption in this country with the desire for large oaky Cabernet. I still remember that quote about ""putting on the makeup"" and I agree with it completely. I think this phase is waning quickly. Then you have the labor aspect. Migrant/Hispanic labor is the reason wine in the US exists, and they don't/didn't get insurance and it sucks.   All it all it was edited to be incendiary. The Parker/Roland thing probably had a lot of merit. Parker and Advocate seem to have stumbled into the abyss and you are starting to see more consumers use their own judgment on what they want to drink, and aren't afraid to for their own opinions. But, you still have people with money who will hire a well known consultant for instant street cred. Roland still makes the rounds, Heidi Barret is another, Phillipe Melka, etc.  The labor aspect may have changed slightly, but I don't work with a lot of field labor anymore. The ACA might have helped the big problem, but even here in Eastern Washington we have medical clinics and housing that caters almost exclusively to farm labor. Here's what I do know about that part of the film: I worked at Staglin Family, possibly the year after the movie was released. The Staglins are incredibly nice people. Shari Staglin has enough money that she most certainly doesn't have to make me a bagel sandwich for breakfast at 6am, but more often that not, there she was. It's true, they do give the field crew a shirt/jacket every year, but here's the thing, they aren't Staglin employees. They are David Abreu's (viticulturist) employees, so asking the Staglins if they provide them healthcare is baseless. And those vatos are hard. They are up at 3am, picked out by 6am, and then sorting fruit till 9pm or later, and then doing it again 6 days a week. They definitely deserve more than they get.  TL;DR: Some of its points have merit, some are fading from the industry, and editing was meant to incite.  Sorry for the wall of text/rant.  *Edit: To answer your question, it hit right at a high point where wine was becoming more accepted in American society, and was one of the first to get there."
wine,3e0i5h,TheDyood,4,Tue Jul 21 01:25:28 2015 UTC,"My theory (which is mine) (which I wrote): Mondovino is three movies in one: First, it is a polemic against the globalization of wine. Second, it is a comedy of manners about people in the business. For example, I am convinced that Michel Rolland knew that his role was to be the villain of the piece, and he hammed it up accordingly. This part of the movie also invites us to observe the role of family in the wine business, with the De Montille family at one end of the spectrum and the Mondavi family at the other. Third, there is a little movie inside the movie about dogs and what they say about their owners. YMMV."

wine,3dys0w,HornetAttack,4,Mon Jul 20 17:05:41 2015 UTC,"The annual Favre-a-Thon weekend has three parts - Friday night dinner, Saturday lunch, and Saturday night dinner. The dinners are always the more extravagant events, with the themes more rigidly determined. Lunch is exciting because there are fewer constraints and you never know what you are going to get. This year was no exception. The theme was ""luncheon red or white Burgundy."" There were some really great treats in here, and this was a ton of fun.   2012 Schloss Schönborn Erbacher Marcobrunn Riesling Großes Gewächs - This was ordered off the list. Dark fruit and acid. Nice way to start the lunch.   1995 Krug Champagne Vintage Brut - More Krug!? Well, can’t complain. Compared to the Krugs from the previous night, this was hefty and powerful, with toasty and yeasty notes. Definitely a more “masculine” expression of Krug.   2001 Domaine G. Roumier / Christophe Roumier Bonnes Mares -  Lots of dark berry and purple fruit on the nose, and just as dark on the palate. A deep wine that clearly needs more time. Still very nice.   2000 François Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos - This was very Raveneau (which means that it was very good), but according to those with more experience than I have with Raveneau Clos, it did not live up to the potential that Raveneau Clos has to stun and amaze. I still thought it was great, but perhaps a bit muted?   1985 Domaine Jacques Prieur Musigny - Very funky nose on the pop and pour. Some thought it was heat damaged but others thought it was just fine. This wine was definitely on the earthier side of the spectrum, with some dark red fruit underlying the earthy and funky elements.   2011 Maison Ilan Chambertin - Served blind, which should have been my first hint that this was Maison Ilan! It had a nice but delicate nose of sweet Pinot fruit, but it was a bit thin on the palate given the promise the nose showed.  2008 Domaine Armand Rousseau Père et Fils Chambertin - An awesome surprise, as I never thought that a Rousseau Chambertin would be deemed a “luncheon wine.”  This had a gorgeous perfume of roses and sultry red fruit. I could sniff this all day. On the palate this had incredible depth and length, great texture and the finish just went on and on. Really open for such a young Grand Cru, this is a stunner now and will really shine with more time.   1986 Domaine Tollot-Beaut Corton-Charlemagne - Out of a magnum.  This had a nice aged white Burgundy nose with yellow fruit, buttered popcorn, and a hint of natural oxidation. This was firm but with good acid on the palate. A really nice showing!  2000 Bonneau du Martray Corton-Charlemagne - Out of a magnum. This was nice to try next to the ’86, and while it was good, it did not stand out.   2001 Bonneau du Martray Corton-Charlemagne - More lively and exciting than the 2000, though it still didn’t make a profound impression on me. Definitely nice wine, but it was sort of lost in the shuffle.   1988 Domaine Dujac Morey St. Denis - The oldest Dujac village wine I’ve tried, and I was surprised how well it held up! This was nice on the nose with light florals, mild spice, and some earthy elements adding complexity. It was relatively light on the palate, but a very enjoyable drink all around.    1993 Domaine Dujac Morey St. Denis - This was essentially a fresher, more substantial version of the ’88. I actually liked it better, and it’s in a great place right now. Also, a funny story about this and the preceding bottle. A cute young server at the wine bar/restaurant was really impressed by this bottle and the ’88. She said that she had no idea wine could taste like this. So, my friend invited her to the Dujac Grand Cru dinner that night! Pretty fun to see her reaction to bottles several steps above these.   2002 Henri Boillot Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Perrières - Round, open, and very good.   2002 Domaine du Clos de Tart Clos de Tart - I really liked this, perhaps more than most. Elegant red-fruited nose, nice medium-weight palate, and just really tasty.   2011 Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Les Chaumes - Really good Pure and silky with bright cherry fruit and a lively acid streak. It’s just so pretty.   2006 Hubert Lamy Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet - A relatively rare bottling. Fun to try, but not exceptional.   2005 Domaine de Montille Pommard 1er Cru Les Pèzerolles - Really expressive nose of red and dark fruit, with spice, wood and dark fruit dominating the palate."

There are better value options for Barossa that might look classier if you're going to the effort of making a fancy wooden presentation.  Perhaps you have confused it with 'Chocolate Block', which is a stunning south african red?  My advice would be to stick to a theme... Nine SA reds, nine bordeaux-ish blends,  nine of your dad's favourite grape... Whatever. For south african wines... if you're in the UK I'd recommend sawinesonline.co.uk , the prices are fair and some smaller producers are represented.

Some things top of mind for me are:   2 bottles 2011 Ridge Three Valleys (~$50 total) 2 bottles from Mullineux (I think a SA wine??) (let's assume ~$50 total) 2 bottles Italian negroamoro (can't think of any bottles, but usually good value - ~$40)  2 bottles Cotes du Rhone: Arnoux et Fils Vacqueyras Cuvee 2012 (~$40) 1 bottle Jura: Chateau d'Arlay, pinot, 2009 (~$30)"

I opened the Sangiovese last night to go with my tomato/basil/goat cheese stuffed portobello caps and it was fantastic. It has a nice deep almost smokey/spicy taste that mellowed out to a dark cherry fruit flavor. I think it's one of the better done Sangioveses I've tasted out of Washington.   The other one that stood out to me was the Island White. It is a nice blend of Madeleine Sylvaner and Madeleine Angevine with a little Riesling thrown in to sweeten it up. I did try the Madeleine Angevine by it's self and wow, talk about DRY!! I foresee the Island White going with a cheese plate in my near future ;) I bought the Cabernet Franc on a recommendation, but I haven't tasted it yet. (Though it had several silver medals under it's belt, so I look forward to it.)    Hope that inspires you to check them out, it was really pretty out there. My sunburn was totally worth it!!"

Great balance - relatively pale in the glass with very subtle fruit in the front, great minerality in the back. I think we drank a bit early as it was a bit tight, but watermelon and strawberries still come through. The minerality is what gets me on this one - great all around summer wine; particularly as we had just gotten off the lake.  Happy Summer Sunday!"

I had this bottle in the SKYE restaurant in Jakarta with a confit duck leg.  Initially quite hot on the nose, notes of cherries and violets. A faint mushroom/gaminess.  Surprisingly light on the palate, bright red currants and strawberry coulis. A slight velvety tannic grip. Leather, mushroom and vanilla on the finish."

Really don't feel like it's truly the best place to grow pinot... their chard on the other hand is great.  A lot of the pinot seems very light and lacking of much depth, and it seems like many producers compensate by incorporating a percentage of whole bunch ferments into their final blends.  One pinot I loved however was the ""Circe"" label, which is a bit hard to find but done by the head winemaker at DCA there who is a very good winemaker."

The owner is a big wine lover and I did a recent dinner there with 14 bottles. It's Spanish tapas and quite good — potatoes bravas, grilled octopus, etc. it's in Hollywood on Melrose west of La Brea. I'm good with the last place too but I think SOS has more interesting food overall.  Edit: there's another interesting place that would be worth calling, right by SOS called L'Assiette. It means ""The Dish"" in French and they only offer steak frites (or portabella or salmon) in a $25 3-course meal. Steaks are sous vide and come out with 2-day fries in two rounds so they are hot to the last bite. It's usually not too crowded so they may accommodate a big table of winos.

I'm happy to go anywhere from a personal standpoint but I don't want the cost of the meal overall to be an inhibiting factor for people. I will check out L'Assiette though. Any place that can accommodate a group of 8-10, is reasonably affordable, and doesn't mind us sitting there for hours after our meal ends is A-Okay in my book."

wine,3dux9m,CondorKhan,7,Sun Jul 19 18:43:58 2015 UTC,"I posted a small note on this wine on the thread from when /r/ChampagneFloozy came to my house for dinner, but this was so bizarre and distinctive that I thought it required its own post.  This is basically unfortified fino sherry, aged under flor, so in that sense it’s a lot like Vin Jaune. It’s put out by the only producer crazy enough to put out something like this, Equipo Navazos.   When we opened this I was kind of split on it.. the nose was so strange and overpowering… it smelled like a gas station and sea water. The palate was equally pungent… lots of salinity and tanginess along with strong petrol notes, to the point of almost being off putting. It really required olives or garlicky food to be beautiful.   Since it was open under Pungo (a fairly new Coravin competitor… I’ll post a review when I have tried it on more wines) I put it back in the fridge. I took me a full month to finish the bottle. I have to say, though, that after a month, this was positively singing… the kerosene aromas had faded and integrated into the whole, and the tanginess came to the fore, and revealing some nuttiness and citric acidity. It went from being weird curiosity to being an actual enjoyable wine. I could have probably achieved the same effect on the first day if I had decanted this for a few hours.   Still, you want this with food and with food only. All the typical Fino pairings apply: olives, Marcona almonds, garlic shrimp and jamon. Particularly jamon."
wine,3dux9m,camwheeler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:44:14 2015 UTC,"Nice work - I had this last year at a Equipo Navazos masterclass that I posted some really brief thoughts on here. I preferred the florpower #44 to this #53 Más allá when side by side - they are basically the same wine (single vineyard, 2010 vintage etc) but the 53 has 10 months extra barrel age. Though I liked the #53, our bottle of #44 was just a little more expressive on the nose and that saline drive was amped up a notch."

I will admit this was the last wine of the night and I wasn't as ""focused"".    The Ceretto was 2009, and surprisingly soft for Barolo, I will admit as a huge fan of Nebbiolo this one just didn't pop for me.  Good classic style with rose petal and tart red fruits, strawberry, bright red cherry.  This was a solid wine just didn't have enough character.  The winner of the night was the Argiolas, as someone who doesn't normally go for Grenache this thing was singing.  Great notes of licorice and herbs with dried red notes of raspberry, dark slightly sweet cherries and just the tiniest hint of stereotypical greenness on the finish that really brought everything together"

Harvest in NZ kind of blows though when you work for a big place in the Marlborough; it's basically 7×12 hrs, every day, for 5 or 6 weeks.

wine,3dtrrc,WickWine,2,Mon Jul 20 01:46:25 2015 UTC,"I worked in Marlborough, but have been to wineries up and down the country several times. Things get started in about March/April, so if you start putting feelers out in mid- to late February, you should be fine.  Kumeu definitely offers some good options, such as Kumeu River and Cooper's Creek. In Auckland proper, Villa Maria, Babich and Nobilo (Constellation, basically, so they also make Kim Crawford and some other brands in the one facility, I believe) are all good options, too. Though I would say that Villa is much more a corporate HQ and bottling facility than it is a fun, interesting winery to work in, I imagine – just my opinion having been there a a few times.  You might also want to think about Waiheke Island, maybe one of the larger producers there such as Cable Bay or Man O' War. It's easy to get there from Auckland on the ferry, and you're much more likely to have a fun, hands-on experience. Harvest will be short and quick there, though, as the vineyards and wineries are much smaller.  Good luck!"

We will drop a wine for 3 main reasons.    A)  Price changed and we no longer think it has a good value to cost ratio.   B)  Vintage changed and the quality for price dropped.  C)  We find a new wine from the same region that we like more/ think is more interesting/ is a better value.  When we move a wine to clearance we drop it down 10% off our profit margin so 15-20% retail on average.  (there are always exceptions).  We never move a wine over because of a perceived defect in the wine.  If we think there is a problem with the wine we return it to the distributor."

wine,3dqpje,Smarkie,2,Sun Jul 19 06:23:21 2015 UTC,I would probably select a Valpolicella or a Valpolicella Ripasso from 2010 or 2011. They are almost always under $20. The firm fruitiness will work well with acidity from the vegetables.

wine,3dnd5w,HornetAttack,5,Fri Jul 17 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"So I previously wrote about Friday night’s red wines here . However, before we got to the reds, we started with the whites. The white theme was Krug Clos du Mesnil, Clos d’Ambonnay, vintage from good vintages, or Raveneau Grand Cru. For timing reasons, we actually saved a couple bottles of Krug for later in the weekend so that we could get to the reds. I have to say, it was a great time, but I was Krug’d out by the end! Anyway, here are my notes on the whites:    Vintage Krug  1985 Krug Champagne Vintage Brut - Some bruised apple notes and good acidity initially, but this was marred by just a tinge of oxidation that caused the wine to fade over the course of the night.   1990 Krug Champagne Vintage Brut - This was similar to the ’85, but fresher and brighter with some cool nectarine notes.  1989 Krug Champagne Vintage Brut - There seemed to be a group sentiment against ’89 Krug but I thought it was very nice. I think that a lot of people enjoyed the ’89 far more than they expected.   1996 Krug Champagne Vintage Brut - Easily the best of the wines this flight. The nose was glorious with brioche and buttery fruit aromas, and the wine itself was electric with vibrant acidity set against rich fruit. Really great Champagne.     Clos du Mesnil  1988 Krug Champagne Clos du Mesnil - Very nice and enjoyable with some spice (?) and aged Champagne notes. I really liked this, though I think that I still preferred the ’96 from the prior flight.   1998 Krug Champagne Clos du Mesnil - A fine wine but it didn’t stand out.   2000 Krug Champagne Clos du Mesnil - Really nice with tons of fruit and excellent purity. Great acid lift too makes this wine so alive.  2003 Krug Champagne Clos du Mesnil - I was not a big fan of this wine. It was odd, with a cardboard-y note (not TCA), overripe fruit, and some kind of difficult to describe funk on the nose and palate.     Clos d’Ambonnay  1995 Krug Champagne Clos d'Ambonnay - I wish I could say more about this wine, but all I wrote down was “really good!” And it was.     Raveneau  1991 François Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos - This initially had some sort of odd note that I didn’t know how to characterize, though the wine got better and better once that note blew off. I picked up some light petrol, custard, and apple-y fruit too which was nice. Having just come off of drinking a ton of Champagne, I think that the lack of effervescence relative to the prior bottles I had been drinking skewed my perception a bit, because the wine felt a little too “flat” at first, when really it was probably fine from the get-go. My friend wrote a really good note, though, that I think is a lot fairer than my assessment: “Wow - Raveneau Clos is a super wine with age if you can find them. Well, this one found us this past Friday night and ended up being one of the top wines for me. Aged Raveneau custard, touches of anise, salty lime, really complex and perked up nicely in the glass over the evening. Just like a fine Montrachet - this one got better and more interesting in the glass!”  2007 François Raveneau Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos - Really killer nose with white fruit, stone, rain, apples… It had moderate acid and just got better and better in the glass.      General Thoughts  I love Champagne, but it got a little tough for me to differentiate the wines from one another at a certain point. This was my first experience with Clos du Mesnil and Clos d’Ambonnay, and while I think that these wines were very good, I don’t think they are worth the mark up, at least for my palate. It’s possible that they would have really shone on their own, but I didn’t find most of the Mesnils substantially better than the regular vintage bottles, and at their price point I don’t think they delivered great value, at least not for me. Hopefully I have some experiences down the line that change that perception, though!   The Raveneaus were great, though I think that the ’91 was better than I gave it credit for. Don’t get me wrong, I thought it was very good, but I wasn’t blown away, and it seems like a type of wine that has the capacity to blow people away. All in all, this first night’s dinner was a great start to the weekend."

wine,3dm7vq,ExtractedJuice,2,Fri Jul 17 17:52:16 2015 UTC,"From the story:  The classic example of the style is Vinho Verde, a wine that was traditionally bottled young (the ‘green’ verde refers not to the colour – the wines can be red, white or rosé – but to their youth) with a little carbon dioxide spritz from the fermentation. Today, however, true ‘just-fermented’ spritz is perhaps more likely to be encountered at RAW or the Real Wine Fair; in modern, whistle-clean Vinho Verde today it is more likely to be the result of a little carbonation. That, I think, removes a little of the magic; I’m not such a sucker for that kind of spritz. Stylistically, it seems to me to be something of a strait-jacket; I would think it difficult for a producer to say “I’m making serious/rich/flavoursome/ageworthy wines”, styles which might allow them to raise prices a little, when still pumping carbon dioxide into the wines."

There was one bottle at Bastide restaurant in West Hollywood a few years ago and it was priced below retail. My boss, who knew what it was, immediately ordered it for the table. The wine was as nuanced as any grand cru white burg I've had but with floral notes that never show up in Chards. The finish was 60-90 seconds. It completely changed my world in relation to white wine. He now collects Asteroide, which is how I've had a few vintages.  Recently he shared 1990 Daganeau Maudit which was one of 9 bottles in the USA and much more rare than Asteroide. It was made only in 1989 and 1990 as somewhat of a joke but was anything but that in the glass. It reminded me of a late harvest Chenin Blanc with nuttiness and Tokaji-like aromas."

If you are an experienced oenophile, you probably won't get much out of these. Also note, the scores for these wines are for their price point and what you get out of them, if money was no object you can be assured that these would have scored a bit lower.  14% ABV I bought this for $6.99 and opened it up tonight; Berries right off the bat on the nose on this one, ripe and rich. Has a little bit of pepper on the nose. The nose is a bit reticent, can't quite pick up much more. The palate has more dark berries, plum, decent structure here. A bit of currants on the finish, some herbaceous tones and a little bit jammy. A pleasing glass, would purchase again.

wine,3diuhj,CondorKhan,13,Thu Jul 16 17:32:22 2015 UTC,"Last weekend was the annual “Favre-a-Thon” – a yearly event organized by a friend – and what a weekend it was. On Friday night, 13 of us got together for dinner at The Progress in San Francisco for a night of friendship and wine. There was a red theme and a white theme, and each person was responsible for bringing a bottle from each theme. The white theme was Krug (or Raveneau Grand Cru) and the red theme was DRC from worthy vintages. For the time being I’m just going to write about the reds.     A Pair of 1980s from the Same Cellar  1980 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Grands-Echezeaux - I’m not usually sensitive to TCA, but even I could tell that this was terribly corked after a few minutes in my glass   1980 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Romanée St. Vivant - Now we’re talking! Really pretty red-fruited spice on the nose with a silky palate. This really blossomed in the glass and took on tons of spice!    La Tache  2001 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti La Tâche - Really classy nose with liquid flowers and berries on the palate. Beautiful stuff.    Romanee St. Vivant  1991 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Romanée St. Vivant - My note here is pretty sparse: “pretty lace, rose.”  2000 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Romanée St. Vivant - Just an insane perfume here that jumped straight out of the glass with bright red fruit and flowers and spice and everything nice. Lovely. Vastly exceeded my expectations.   2006 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Romanée St. Vivant - I popped this five hours before dinner and this was a lot more open right off the bat than it was when I had this in April. Nice showing now, on the darker side of the spectrum, but will be excellent with more time in the bottle.    Grand-Echezeaux and Echezeaux  1998 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Grands-Echezeaux - Didn’t take notes here. Fine wine but it didn’t stand out.   2002 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Grands-Echezeaux - Really nice, bright aromatics, with gentle plum and berry flavors in the mouth.   2008 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Grands-Echezeaux - Surprisingly open for its age, and obviously very primary. Easy and tasty drinking.   2006 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Echezeaux - Tasty!    Richebourg  1989 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Richebourg - Really lovely wine. Some nice tertiary notes here but also a bright strawberry element that provided a nice counterpoint to the earthier notes.   2005 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Richebourg - Talk about baby-killing! Dark and spicy, this is a big wine. It continued to open up until the last drop but you can tell that this has so much potential and will be killer in a couple decades.   2011 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Richebourg - Apparently I didn’t take notes on this, but I recall finding it very good, especially for a 2011.     Some After-Dinner Treats  1989 Château Montrose - Similar to the one I had at the Spectrum auction a few weeks ago, but with even more prominent bell pepper/herbal notes. This was definitely a change of pace from the silky smooth, perfumed DRCs.   1996 Château d'Yquem - A nice surprise at the end of the night! Apricots, marzipan (?), and nice acidity to balance it out and keep it lively.     General Thoughts about DRC  DRC wines are, on the whole, lovely, pretty, silky, elegant wines. Hedonistic, but not in the Robert Parker sense. Just really classy juice. I am always excited to drink DRC - a good DRC is awesome stuff - but I don't think they are my favorite red Burgundy producer. That said, this was a fantastic dinner with the greatest company and I am very glad to have been able to participate in such a great tasting."

I think that it's fairly disingenuous to point to these as a particularly egregious example of tasting notes that aren't sufficiently ""helpful."" Most amateur tasting notes are intended to convey the taster's experience and nothing more.  If you read the original post, you will see that I said that I was going to focus on getting my notes on the red wines out for the time being. It is time-consuming for me to write notes for an event like this, so I posted when I had at least one full set of notes for a reasonable subset of the wines we drank that night. The Raveneau and Krug notes will follow at some point in the future.  I am glad that your position allows you to taste wines of this caliber frequently. I think that's great, and I wish that I had more regular access to these sorts of bottles. But to say that this type of post inhibits your desire to take this sub seriously, just wow. R/wine is probably one of the most welcoming and non-pretentious wine forums/message boards out there. You must absolutely hate Wine Berserkers, the Wine Spectator forum, etc. What wine forums do you frequent? I'm not great at taking wine notes. In fact, my palate is pretty  mediocre, all things considered. I just enjoy tasting, reading and writing about wine. Should I not post notes because I can't write a detailed paragraph filled with sufficiently helpful information for each wine? Your position is not novel. In fact, there was recently a pretty passionate dialogue on Wine Berserkers about mass tastings, what constitutes ""excessibe"" [sic] consumption, etc. I don't object to that position. I think it has some merit and reasonable people can disagree on the philosophy and ethics of wine tasting. What I object to is the dishonesty of your post. Your issue isn't that my notes aren't helpful - your issue is that my notes aren't helpful and they relate to trophy wines. I strongly suspect that if these notes related to bargain bin wines, you wouldn't have felt compelled to make the post.  It's too bad that you aren't fond of the sub, because I get the feeling that you could add some really cool content."

If you don't realize that the tasting and deduction is about generalities rather than absolutes then you are going to think it's bullshit .   When they did the Beringer Cabernet and nobody identified it as Cabernet, that is the fault of the wine.   And if they can't nail a Cabernet from Chile, then so what.   That would be an impressive guess.    You can tell when they get a wine that exhibits the typical character of a wine from a region they do a really good job.   But I can see if you aren't into wine why you would get that view.   But they have things like Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from Canada which as far as I know of don't show anything super typical of a region versus say a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand or a cabernet from Napa.   I recently had my first Cabernet from Australia (Mollydooker) and was able to pick out the eucalyptus they tall about and was super psyched about that."

I'm not sure what that would entail, since in my experience the wineries typically guide you through the wines and the history of the winery themselves.   The major benefit I would see would be having a designated driver. You could compare other driver services to see if it seems right for you.  Note that you will also need to pay for tasting fees or cellar tours, which are often waived or partially waived upon a purchase.  When I go, I plan to go to two or three wineries in a day.  I do recommend doing a few wine tastings. It's a great way to learn about the region."
wine,3dilql,bananapajama,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:12:00 2015 UTC,The last time I was in the area (3-4 months ago) there were inter-wineries Uber drivers. Driving is the main challenge and cabs or Uber are probably less than $45/hr though that is a reasonable price versus a hired town car.
wine,3dilql,flitcroft,3,Tue Jul 21 03:52:20 2015 UTC,"This sounds suspect to me - it sounds like they're charging you $45/hr to drive you around Napa to some fine, but ordinary wineries (except for V. Satui - that's like Napa's Chuck E. Cheese and should be avoided).  Tasting at most places in Napa will run from $15 to $50 depending on where you go and what tastings are offered (for example, library wine tastings maybe more expensive).  Anyway, given that you say you're road tripping, I'd just drive yourself and set your own agenda.  The people at the wineries are generally friendly and welcoming and you won't need a tour guide to enjoy yourself."
wine,3dilql,fursink,3,Thu Jul 16 21:09:55 2015 UTC,If they want to be just your driver for $45 per hour that is not bad.  If they want to go in to the wineries with you and provide additional info / tour- that sounds horrible.
wine,3dilql,dirtysouthwine,2,Fri Jul 17 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely go to Frog's Leap and Duck Horn, the others I've yet to go.  Other suggestions: Corison (most elegant Cabs ive tasted), Heitz Cellars (tastings are free to public but the wines are good), Clos du Val (all rounder good stuff), Robert Sinskey (pinot and chard from Carneros).   Like others said, $45 to be a driver seems alright and I guess they might have some extra banter here and there about the area if they are locals. But do expect to pay for tastings, and to reiterate what others said, some might be wavered with bottle purchases. Best to make an appointment."

wine,3dilql,Eltonpeace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:39:18 2015 UTC,"$45 is on the cheap end of the scale for a driver, but I would suggest looking into Uber for just being driven place to place (no need to pay someone while they're sitting in the car waiting on you to finish your tasting).

wine,3dilql,vinomenal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:31:28 2015 UTC,"The price isn't bad but it really depends whether the $45/hr price covers the tasting fees for all of those places, if they are knowledgeable enough to give a tour, and if they have connections with the wineries. If not, I wouldn't do it unless you don't have a mode of transportation or if you only go for a few hours. I generally get drunk and tired of wine tasting after about 3-4 wineries so 9 also seems like overkill. Those are some pretty good wineries and you can expect to pay anywhere from $15-$25 per person per winery to taste. Many places will waive one tasting fee if you buy 2-3 bottles which can easily cost you $150-$300 total. The staff at these wineries are generally knowledgeable (but sometimes very busy) so if you have your own car or Uber then you can always do it on your own. The thing to do in Napa is wine tasting and enjoying the scenery and this would be a great way to quickly get a feel for what it has to offer. Hope this gives you an idea!"

You like Pinot, so Anderson Valley is where you should go.  Ukiah Valley is hot. Great for Zin. Saracina is one of my favorites in there. Great wines.  Anderson Valley is gorgeous. At the south you have Yorkville Highlands, which has its festival on August 22nd. It's also fairly hot over there. Haven't been impressed with too many wineries over there though, but I have to do more tastings there.  Anderson Valley is where it's at. Much cooler, beautiful Pinots and Rieslings. Roederer Estate makes IMHO the best California sparkling over there. Toulouse Vineyards, Goldeneye (Duckhorn's outfit), Handley, Husch, Balo is where it's at.  Make a stop at Anderson Valley Brewing in Boonville for a beer. Worth it.  You're a Pinot guy, so there are two regions you need to explore in Sonoma County: Russian River and Carneros."

Yorkville Cellars is also cool, though I didn't taste their stuff at their vineyard. Definitely recommend checking out their sweet Malbec.

The Grand Valley stuff I see on the front range is Two Rivers and Canyon Wind, both of which seem decent but nothing has really impressed me yet. One of the most popular wineries is the Infinite Monkey Theorem, which makes some good stuff but I don't think they have any facilities on the west slope. Maybe /u/masonba can add to this. Please post a follow up to your trip.  When are you visiting? Don't miss the peaches if they're in season."
wine,3dijs5,andtheodor,2,Thu Jul 16 16:24:55 2015 UTC,"Sutcliffe, Two Rivers and Canyon Wind (their Anemoi label wines are super big and luscious) are all awesome and make some really nice wines.

They have vineyards in Palisade but the winery is in Boulder. As far as price point, I think they are making the best wines under 20 dollars in Colorado. You could try and contact them before you go, because maybe they could meet you at the vineyards instead of the tasting room.  If you are in Denver, you must go to my family's winery, Balistreri Vineyards. We make completely natural wine (not filtered, not fined, no SO2, etc.) from grapes grown on the western slope. The white wines are fermented on the skin like a red wine, so they're really unique. There is only a small percentage of wineries in the world that make wine like Balistreri...

Their entire label is pretty hipster-like and they sort of have an attitude of being like a craft brewery. If I'm not mistaken, they don't actually own any vineyards and are simply a negociant winemaker. Personally, I find their wines ridiculously pricey for what you're getting. I always see them around $25 a bottle and I would think $15 is too much for their product.   I know this thread is all about wine, but here in Colorado we're not really known for it. We can make some decent stuff, but nothing that will really knock your socks off. Instead, I would suggest making your way to one of our many fantastic breweries. A lot of the best beer in the country is made in this state. Stranahan's Whiskey is also pretty good, if you're in Denver. They do free tours of their distillery."

wine,3dkfyp,Gwernaroth,8,Fri Jul 17 00:06:53 2015 UTC,"French guy living in California here.  First of all, most American wine lovers know what terroir is. No need to explain it.  The reason why most American wine consumers will go by varietal is simply because when California (where commercial production started), most wines sold (and still are) were single varieties.  It's not imprecise. Stop the condescension right there, because it betrays your ignorance of American wine. What's imprecise about a bottle of California Chardonnay that will tell you on its label not only what grapes the wine was made with, but where the grapes are from? Tell me. How imprecise is it? It's not. Especially if the name of the vineyard is on it, which is the case for many high end wines.  When the first winemakers first made wine in California commercially, they mostly made it using specific grapes. At that point, it was still an experiment. They needed to get that single grape right. And it's not like it's not unheard of in the Old World - Burgundy, Chablis, Alsace, Germany, Austria, many Italian regions make single variety wines.  American consumers just got used to knowing what a single variety wine tasted like - even if many of them are not 100% Cab, or Merlot, or Sauvignon. But that's how they navigate it for most of them. Then many know about appellations - AVAs - and what characteristics a Chardonnay from Russian River will yield, as opposed to one from Carneros. Or the difference between a Pinot from Anderson Valley and one from a Central Coast AVA.  You just need to learn more about American wines, that's all."
wine,3dkfyp,arnaudh,-4,Fri Jul 17 00:40:01 2015 UTC,"ok so you just went ahead and completely ignored the part where I repeated I wasn't judging and had no wish to be condescendent.  Your points are somewhat valid and enlightningd on some aspects but the passive-agressiveness, no, thank you."
wine,3dkfyp,arnaudh,7,Fri Jul 17 01:20:18 2015 UTC,"Well, you did say you were not judging, but you did - it's right there in your post. I came out harsh, and maybe I went overboard. But realize that you did too in the way you formulated things.  American wine is marketed differently.  Also, there is something to be said for its simplicity. The complexity of the French AOC system - even after its reform - is getting in its own way. Most French consumers know a few, but none of them - obviously, save for some geeks and sommeliers - knows about the hundreds of them. Think most French wine drinkers would know how to place Madiran, Saussignac or Tursan? Or what grapes go into those wines? Of course not.  Consumption per capita in France is dropping at an alarming rate. Young French people barely drink any wine. It doesn't help that French lawmakers have outlawed any form of advertising or promotion for wine.  On the other hand, American millennials are drinking a lot more wine than their parents. It's just a matter of a few years before young American consumers drink more wine than their French counterparts.  Maybe there's something to be said for the simplicity of American wine labeling regulation, as opposed to the cumbersome AOC/AOP system."
wine,3dkfyp,madkent,3,Fri Jul 17 01:23:24 2015 UTC,"Australia is the same, FYI. New Zealand too. We still talk about terroir - any wine lover will know the difference between a Margaret River and a Coonawarra cab - but since both regions produce any number of varietal wines, it makes sense to clarify what grape we're talking about.   To be honest, when I started getting into old world wines, I had the opposite reaction - why don't these bottles list varietals? It makes sense for the consumer to have something simple like general varietal characteristics to cling to. An argument could be made that a focus on terroir to the exclusion of varietal labelling alienates the consumer from a fantastic old world of wine."

wine,3dkfyp,CondorKhan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:28:35 2015 UTC,"In the European system of viticulture, there's very little in the way of experimentation. A wine from Chablis will always be chardonnay, therefore if you know Chablis, you know what you'll be getting. However, in the New World, it's generally the case that any varietal can be made in any location and with any wine making techniques. Our laws don't restrict us to a set style or grape based on where we are.   Now, will every grape make a decent wine just anywhere? Of course not. Certain areas are better suited to one grape or another.   Yet there is not a single area in the New World which I can think of that only grows one varietal. Even the Stag's Leap District, which is  only about 500 hectares (which is smaller than all Chablis grand cru's put together), makes wines from Cab. Sauv., Cab. Franc, Zinfandel, Malbec, Merlot, Petite Verdot, and Chardonnay. And all of those can be purchased as single varietal wines. So though it's only about 5 km2 of vineyards, there's 7 wines available on their own.   Add to that, the market in the New World treats varietal names almost like their own brands. Someone here can ask for chardonnay without a care in the world about where it comes from. They just know that they want something made from that type of grape."

The fact that you can find Trousseau Gris in Sonoma, or that the North Fork can change grapes to combat climate change are pros.    Young winemakers are taking chances in technique and making awesome wines with obscure varietals - none of which would be allowed under the European AOC laws.   Of course to take the most advantage of this as a consumer, you need to do a ton of homework, and/or have a great wine shop nearby to steer you."

Resveratrol concentrations in wine are so tiny that by the time you're making a difference in your heart health, you already died of alcohol poisoning.  Someone posted a study recently (I'll look for it) stating what I now think is the obvious: People who drink wine tend to be more affluent and therefore have better diets in general and better access to health care.

Still, wine tops out around 0.65 mg resveratrol per liter; people supplementing it will sometimes take 150 or even 450 mg per day, which is far above any wine.  This said, the benefits ascribed to resveratrol have not been observed with resveratrol supplementation -- only with red wine.  This implies that some or all of the supposed benefits are actually from other ingredients in the wine, primarily alcohol."
wine,3dgwv3,meowmixiddymix,4,Thu Jul 16 04:30:28 2015 UTC,Not in my experience. You want your final number to be your final number. I've added SO2 literally 30 seconds before bottling and mixed. Bottle age will let it settle and integrate/dissipate.
wine,3dgwv3,TheDyood,2,Thu Jul 16 14:00:56 2015 UTC,I run final sulfurs the morning of bottling and adjust if necessary.  It's usually unnecessary though since we adjust them in the days prior when racking/filtering.

My experience is that you do a full composite sample of all barrels then adjust your free SO2 as you're racking into your final tank prior to bottling. I don't know of a reason why you couldn't add the morning of bottling but if you've got a sexy wine that's been barrel aging for 18 months you probably want to agitate it as little as possible so mixing after it's in tank isn't best."

wine,3dgwv3,masonba,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:43:47 2015 UTC,"From the start!  Just kidding...but SO2 is added at many points in the wine making process. This may include:    during harvest to prevent overripe fruits from oxidizing before fermentation to kill off ambient yeasts before they inoculate with their own cultivated yeasts after fermentation to kill unwanted bacteria in the barrel to stop oxidation during racking to stop oxidation before bottling   All of this though depends on the winery, and also, it's sort of complicated because you need to understand the difference between free and bound so2."

The color: dark dark garner with light variations around the rim. The nose. Hello dirt! Lots of dirt. Fruit. Jammy fruit but not overwhelming. Lots of alcohol 14.6%. I can smell some kind of kick to the wine. Like a spiciness. But j can't put my finger on it.  Medium viscosity. Medium tannins. The structure is medium minus. Acidity is medium to medium minus. The finish is short.  Conclusion: this wine has peaked. I'm afraid that it may have only 30-60 more minutes left before it starts to go flat just a gut feeling. We'll find out. It's not s bad wine.

wine,3dg2ih,wtf81,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:35:11 2015 UTC,South to North:  Hess has a very unique experience- lots of cool art and their wines are ok. They do a bit of everything. I'm not a fan of their marketing but still one of my old favorites.  Artessa has stunning views and decent wine. Stop in. Split a tasting and jet.  Del Dotto cave tours are fun and their wine is nice but the tours are expensive and the pours are heavy. The Napa location is much better than the other.  Frog's leap is a cool earthy organic spot. Great zin.   Tres Sabores is similar and much smaller. All organic but delicious.  Stag's (not stags') leap wine cellars put Napa valley on the map and their cabs are great.  The lady and I LOVED Paraduxx. Tons of customizable options there  Hall was ok. Solid but not spectacular.   Elizabeth Spencer is a fun stop too.  T. Vine and Tank (next door neighbors) up in Calistoga were also highlights. T vine makes some of my favorite zins and Tank's prohibition style winemaking in a renovated 1950s style gas station were charming.   In general Calistoga/Healdsburg offer less touristy fare and more local/friendly.   I wish I would have spent more time in Sonoma too.  Hope this helps

wine,3ddzzr,winemule,2,Wed Jul 15 15:08:58 2015 UTC,Been extremely difficult to keep up wine grape production in the SJV. The use of mechanization of vineyard practices is helping to improve the profitability of production but its still hard to break even.
wine,3ddzzr,sobergrad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:24:52 2015 UTC,"It sounds very difficult indeed. From a story that ran last year at Western Farm Press, a summary of difficulties:  ""Low demand for grapes following two large harvests in a row, which has left wineries with ample inventories of wine.  Lackluster sales over the past two years of wines made from grapes grown widely in the San Joaquin Valley. These wines, typically selling for under $10 a bottle, gained popularity during the recent recession. But, with the economy and consumer confidence picking up steam, shoppers have been trading up the price scale to buy higher-priced wines made from grapes produced in California’s more prestigious wine growing regions, like the North Coast.  The relative ease with which winemakers can substitute foreign supplies of bulk wine at the lower end of the price scale due to consumers that are origin indifferent. By contrast, consumers purchasing wines above $10 per bottle are much more in tune to origin and in many cases make that a primary factor when buying wine."""
wine,3ddzzr,GahMatar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"Couple excerpts:  DiBuduo noted that demand for lower priced wines is declining, while demand and sales of wines $10 and above are increasing. “There is still a large base of consumers drinking wines under $10, but it is definitely getting smaller. In most cases, the SJV [San Joaquin valley] is providing grapes for this base, though some of the lower priced wines are being backfilled with imports.”  The North Coast counties of Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino and Lake are another matter. Allied Grape Growers has seen good demand for most wine grapes with strong, fair pricing—even if a few varieties in some areas are challenged. Cabernet Sauvignon is hot. Pinot Noir in Sonoma was in demand but as of late has been flat. Pinot Grigio is desirable because there’s not enough supply for the current demand.  and:  ""We know you are already farming sustainably. The major difference is all the paperwork that accompanies this designation.”"

If you are an experienced oenophile, you probably won't get much out of these. Also note, the scores for these wines are for their price point and what you get out of them, if money was no object you can be assured that these would have scored a bit lower.  Mulderbosch Cabernet Sauvignon Rose - $8.99  The nose hits you immediately with strawberry and grapefruit, you also get a hint of the mineral on the nose, it is quite nice, nothing to write home about but enjoyable.  The palate is much better than the nose for me, you get all the same notes you do on the nose plus the minerality shows up a little more, nice acidity to it as well. Very easy going wine, sure to please most of your house guests during spring and summer. This is a somewhat dry and crisp rose with balance and has a very slight sweetness to it.  This can be enjoyed with most light summer fare in the salad and seafood department. Not a complex wine but a stellar daily drinker during warm months that I drink nice and chilled and for under $10 a bottle I am hooked.

I wanted to share some of the stuff I've bought and enjoyed out here. I have not been into wine very long so all of this has been new to me.   Stag's Leap and Chateau Montelena were some of my favorites in Napa. The 2012 Cask 23 cab from stag's was great. Really liked the 07 and 08 Estate cabs from Montelena. The experience and people at Mark Herald in downtown Napa were wonderful. Wasn't a huge fan of Luna.  Miner had some decent stuff as well.   Dragonette and Zaca Mesa were the 2 wine clubs I joined here on the central coast. The 2013 2013 Radian Hills Pinot Noir from dragonette and the Eight Barrel and Black Barrel Syrahs from Zaca Mesa are some of the best wines I've had. Also enjoyed Au Bon Climat for their Pinot in Santa Barbara. Martian and Kenneth Volk have some interesting stuff and some different varietals that I haven't seen much here. KV had a negrette and Cabernet Pfeffer that I haven't tried anywhere else that we really enjoyed, and Martian had a pretty solid Dark energy Syrah and Mouvedre that I loved.

wine,3d85q1,thewaywardvagabond,2,Tue Jul 14 06:53:23 2015 UTC,"Few questions from a newb: is this style of vine-growing the one I see called 'bush-vine' viticulture? Low to the ground, bushy in appearance, etc.  As a follow on question, seems like this style of vine-growing would make harvesting a little more difficult - is this so? What are the advantages of this style versus trellised or other more vertical styles of vine-growing?"
wine,3d85q1,madkent,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:34:21 2015 UTC,Yes this type of training for vines is called bush vine or goblet training. It does make harvest a little difficult and yields are smaller but the shade from the vine prevents the fruit from getting damaged by sun and heat. I've only really seen this style for old zinfandel vines though.

wine,3d85q1,sobergrad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"There really is no greater benefit to this type of training, it is just a very traditional type. Makes for prettier looking vineyards. Generally lower yielding vines. Easy to prune though!"
wine,3d85q1,Le_Grand_Fromage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:49:26 2015 UTC,I'll give you some benefits:  Price of planting- this is huge actually  Wind resistance- no wire=no wire damage (use a post though)  Can have lower labor costs in hand farmed systems  Works better in steep slope systems- and other low-vigor self regulating planting sites  works well in low density plantings in dry locations but also in ultra high density in depleted soils  Works really well in no-till systems  Easy to walk around vineyard  Good fruit heat retention at night- at least when you keep them cut down all the way to the ground  Fractured light in the fruit zone naturally  Well regulated leaf area for low vigor sites and more even solar distribution throughout the day.

If you are an experienced oenophile, you probably won't get much out of these.  Also note, the scores for these wines are for their price point and what you get out of them, if money was no object you can be assured that these would have scored a bit lower.  for part 2 of the affordable wine threads, I chose Butter by Jam Cellars. I paid $13.99 for this at Bevmo and it is a decent Chard.   The name definitely has a place here, there is a hint of butter on the nose and the finish.  At first I was not interested in this due to the name to be honest, I thought it would be too over the top (and it may be to some) but for a 14 dollar bottle, I would recommend you give it a shot. There is some oak and fruit on the nose (grapefruit/slight citrus/pears). On the palate there is a little more fruit, hint of vanilla and finishes with that butter note with the oak being making a very short appearance. This is a creamy, coating Chardonnay so avoid if that is not your type of Chard. This is an easy drinking wine, I am enjoying it and can say I would buy it again at some point but I would not pay over $18 for this bottle. For a budget bottle, I rate this 86/100"

Way too much artificial oak and sweetness. Though, if you like Rombauer or La Crema (JaM cellars wine maker used to work for both of these wineries), this will be in your wheelhouse.  I find that for the price you're better off with either Rickshaw Chardonnay ($15) (similar style but more acidity, less sweet and more vibrant tropical fruit instead of butter/cream notes) or perhaps even Grayson Cellars Chardonnay ($10). It may not have as nice of a label or marketing as Butter, but it's only 10 dollars and tastes really similar, but slightly less overdone."

I've had plenty of Australian shiraz viogniers and never gotten a smoky hint - am I doing it wrong? Is smokiness associated with age? Any help understanding would be greatly appreciated!"
wine,3d6g4a,madkent,4,Tue Jul 14 05:23:37 2015 UTC,"As with all things olfactory, it's a bit of a blur.. 'Smoke' as a aroma descriptor can mean a bunch of different things, peat-smoke in Islay, Brett associated phenols in wild-fermented beer (and wine), flint stone-minerality in certain white wines and the charred meat/cured meat note that comes with well made Syrah, typically from northern Rhone. Then again, many full-bodied wines who rely on a backbone of heavily toasted barrels can come across as smokey to some, although I prefer to use descriptors as coffe, toast and caramel in that case.   In the case of Syrah, it's seems to me it has a quite small 'window' when going from underripe->IDEAL->overripe. The smokiness and peppery notes asscociated with Cote-Rotie and Cornas wines often become overpowered by massive plummy fruit when growing in hotter Australian areas. If you want to experience that in an Aussie Shiraz, better look for some cooler-climate areas or vineyards planted at higher altitue."

Seems like there are better deals to be had elsewhere.  On another note, anyone have any other recommendations on bottles from '86 that might be interesting to try?"
wine,3d6ji2,andtheodor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:41:37 2015 UTC,"The douche comments were about another commenter, not your post, though the warning about paying a premium in Paris is apt. As far as other '86s go, lots of good Bordeaux still - the tannin structure is hard and unyielding but these are living a very long life - even ""lesser"" growths are doing well. I just had a ch. Beychevelle the other night and it is finally softening a bit and was delicious.   Good Sauternes and some Cali wines, too, if you care to look there."
wine,3d6ji2,redaniel,-3,Tue Jul 14 20:39:49 2015 UTC,"tell me op, what would you think if another op's headline was ""im coming to berlin, where can I buy a porsche?"", ""im coming to bern, where can i buy a rolex?"", ""im coming to rome milan, where can i buy an armani suit?""... it is not just that the product is not made where you are going, it is going to be more expensive there, you can get it anywhere in america and you are buying something retardedly overpriced."
wine,3d6ji2,JBWino,3,Mon Jul 13 23:55:51 2015 UTC,"Provenance is likely to be better in France and depending on where you are coming from, the Euro is pretty cheap right now. Oh, and most Swiss watches are more from Geneva than Bern. Your comment was pretty douchey for no reason."
wine,3d6ji2,arnaudh,3,Tue Jul 14 02:14:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, the euro (no capital required, by the way) is low. But Paris is anything but.  Now I live in the U.S. and will be in Paris next week. I can tell you right now that the bottles I'll be bringing back from France will not be first growth Bordeaux but most likely some hard-to-find Alsace or Loire or small Champagne growers that can't be found in the U.S. Because if I want a nice bottle of Bordeaux, I'll probably buy it here and end up paying less than in Paris."
wine,3d6ji2,redaniel,2,Tue Jul 14 03:19:58 2015 UTC,there's at least 3 great small grower inclined shops near charles hebdo - i found an excellent loire a good champagne but no excellent alsace.

wine,3d4kei,cmde45,5,Mon Jul 13 13:52:31 2015 UTC,"My trick - put the empty decanter in the fridge for 15 minutes before you decant the wine.  After 15 minutes, the decanter should be around 55 degrees."
wine,3d4kei,chicagowine,2,Mon Jul 13 15:00:42 2015 UTC,Great idea...if only I had space for the decanter in the fridge!
wine,3d4kei,winemule,3,Mon Jul 13 15:02:00 2015 UTC,I personally use a Libbey wine carafe as a decanter.  It should fit in most bottle chillers and is ~$4 at Walmart.  http://www.moranusa.com/images/products/detail/libbey_795.png
wine,3d4kei,chicagowine,2,Mon Jul 13 15:07:50 2015 UTC,Now that is a great idea. Anybody want a slightly used Riedel decanter?
wine,3d4kei,winemule,7,Mon Jul 13 16:50:04 2015 UTC,"I disagree with those saying not to decant younger wines. Old wines are decanted to remove sediment but are usually pretty fragrant right away. Young wines, however, can be tight and really benefit the most from aeration and opening up. When you get a chance, buy 2 bottles of the same thing and decant one a couple of hours before you open the other and taste them side by side. I'll bet the decanted one tastes better.  Here are a few articles that agree. There are plenty more, I'm sure.  You're Not Decanting Enough  5 Reasons You Should Use a Decanter – Everyday!  When Should You Decant Wine?  Why Decant Even Cheap Wine?"
wine,3d4kei,legrandmaster,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I enjoyed these reads! Honestly another person suggested decanting for however long needed, then just pouring it back into the bottle and putting in the chiller. I think that's the route I'll take, lol."
wine,3d4kei,wolfballlife,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:45:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I would decant young wine before old wine even... Amazing the improvement."
wine,3d4kei,dcloafer,3,Tue Jul 14 20:56:02 2015 UTC,"1) Decant it. I use my French press carafe or a pyrex measuring cup. I'm not fancy, I'm just a wine snob.  2) Pour it back in the bottle and chill to your liking."
wine,3d4kei,Muppet_Mower,2,Mon Jul 13 15:28:54 2015 UTC,Pour the wine in a decanter then place the decanter in an ice bucket or similar container with ice. I do this for whites and reds.
wine,3d4kei,GahMatar,2,Mon Jul 13 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"I solve this by not decanting most of the time. Otherwise, chill the wine in the fridge for 30 minutes before decanting, it'll raise to serving temperature while it breathes. If you think it's too warm (alcohol overwhelming) then pop in the fridge for 10 minutes.  If you're not drinking a really expensive wine, don't sweat it. If you do, well, decant in the cellar you can so obviously afford ;-)"
wine,3d4kei,Socrates5150,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:31:43 2015 UTC,"I'm with /u/gahmatar on this, although I would put the wine in the fridge for longer. Let it get actually get cold that way as it sits in the decanter for an hour or so it slowly warms. It may be a bit cold as you pour your first glass, but it'll warm up soon enough in the glass.  Also, it can be nice to skip the decanter and simply take your time with the bottle. Pouring from the bottle over 8 hours will give you a great picture of how the wine develops over time."
wine,3d4kei,HRP,0,Mon Jul 13 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"Decanting is overrated.  Make your first couple glasses small ones and drink them slowly.  Appreciate the change as it opens up over the course of even just 20-30 minutes.  If it's a nice, aged wine?  Go ahead and decant.  But your average daily drinker doesn't need it."

Too hard to tell otherwise - will vary between locations, storage conditions, bottle condition etc. Send some photos and a history of how they were stored to a local wine auction house and they can give you a proper valuation."
wine,3d7ii1,camwheeler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:00:35 2015 UTC,"1984 was a miserable to adequate vintage in France. Moet did not produce a 1984 vintage Dom Perignon. If indeed your bottle is labelled as 1984, I'd say it is worth as much as a $3 bill. The 1982 is also suspect if you bought them together."

wine,3d7ii1,andtheodor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"Your replacement cost for both of these bottles is in the range of $350-500 each. If you're trying to sell them, your realized value will be much lower, especially since you're below the minimum consignment for most auction houses. Other resellers will want to know things like: have they been stored in an actively controlled cellar? How long have you owned them? Who originally bought them? What are the fill, color, and label condition like?  With a few notable exceptions, the answer to people who want to sell a couple old bottles is that they're better off drinking them with wine loving friends and family."
wine,3d7ii1,j3w,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:18:43 2015 UTC,"wine loving friends and family   Also, good tip for those lacking loving friends and family - you can drink a fine wine and then pee on someone's grave with it. So...clutch advice for the other half, right there."

wine,3d2oe4,ArsenalZT,8,Mon Jul 13 06:59:41 2015 UTC,"The course itself seems like it's more intended as an overview of what you should be studying for level 2 (certified). The level 1 exam is easier than the course work leading up to it. It's as though the level 1 is just to weed out people who are too far away from being able to study for their level 2 in the next couple years. There's a lot of emphasis on deductive tasting and critical evaluation of the wine. I think we did 22 blind tastings in two days.    DO NOT worry about anything other than wine. The exam is 70 questions and you only need 60% to pass. That meas you can miss 28 questions. There were 5 questions regarding spirits, beer, and sake total. So if you paid zero attention to those and got all the questions wrong, you'd still be able to miss 23 other questions."
wine,3d2oe4,hot_like_wasabi,3,Mon Jul 13 10:35:14 2015 UTC,"If you already have a decent knowledge of wine, you'll do well with relatively little studying.

It's all multiple choice theory questions - no service or tasting required to pass."

If you are an experienced oenophile, you probably won't get much out of these.  Also note, the scores for these wines are for their price point and what you get out of them, if money was no object you can be assured that these would have scored a bit lower.  This wine is one of my favorite house wines that I enjoyed at a restaurant and the bottles can be found for 8.99-10.99 usually. This is an easy drinking red that pairs well with lots of food choices and is light enough in my opinion to be enjoyed by itself. Varietals are; Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Mourvedre Oak regime; 6 to 8 months in 300L barrels of French and American oak  Tasting notes - ripe red fruits, small amount of spice and herbs, a bit of pepper, overall a solid affordable choice, my rating with the price in consideration is a solid 88/100"

wine,3d1u22,HornetAttack,6,Sun Jul 12 21:00:21 2015 UTC,"In a weekend of awesome wines (which I will write about when I have more time), these were a few of the bottles that got me most excited. The wines in this flight, especially the 1986 and 1990, are true unicorn bottles. Top Coche wines from top vintages, well stored and well aged. Really a treat to get to taste these.  1986 Coche-Dury Meursault Perrieres - Although with air the wine showed a bit oxidized/advanced, the nose on this was excellent, with white flowers and fruit and a hint of botrytis. On the palate it was lacking a bit of acid, but I still really enjoyed it.  1990 Coche-Dury Meursault Perrieres - This was just off the charts awesome. The perfume jumps right of the glass and pulls you in, with a lot of the elements of the 1986 but with fresher fruit aromas, that classic Coche matchstick and a hint of coffee on the nose too. This wine was round, wide open, and just delicious.  2009 Coche-Dury Meursault Perrieres - Another fantastic wine! All sorts of white flowers and peach and orchard fruits and flint. Deep and expansive but also pure and focused. Really stunning. Actually, this whole flight was stunning, even with the oxidation on the 1986. Bottom line: Coche rocks my socks."
wine,3d1u22,flitcroft,2,Sun Jul 12 21:01:52 2015 UTC,"I had 2004 Coche-Dury Mersault Les Chavalieres this week for the first time. The closest thing I've had in comparison was 2011 Aubert Lauren Vineyard Chardonnay. The wine was golden, hugely oaked, integrated to an almost impossible level, and bursting with tropical fruit. It's an amazing wine but for half the price I feel like you can get 98-100% of the quality from the best Chards from Napa. Don't get me wrong, I see why anyone would seek them out -- they're stellar -- but the price premium is a little crazy for top Burg.  http://i.imgur.com/9QrYyXb.jpg  Edit: by ""a little crazy"" I mean $450 for a bottle of Chardonnay. :)"
wine,3d1u22,flitcroft,3,Sun Jul 12 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"I don't have enough Napa chard experience other than a few Kistlers and miscellaneous other bottles but every Napa chard I've had has lacked the elegance of too white Burgundy. Still hoping to have an experience that changes my mind because Burg prices are crazy, but I think the climate difference means that Cali chards are just different animals. As far as value and ultra-premium wines, these Coche MPs were mind-blowingly awesome wines but are they worth $1200-2500/bottle? Really depends on how much disposable income you have. I certainly don't see myself buying them but there is no doubting their excellence.  I had a similar experience this weekend with a number of bottles of Krug Clos du Mesnil and d'ambonnay. I didn't think they were that much, if at all, better than the vintage Krugs we had and the prices are insanely high. Still a treat to drink, but on the whole there aren't that many ultra-premium wines that would ""justify"" the price other than being a ticket to great events where other people open similar wines. DRC is fantastic but most of the time I wouldn't want to be paying $1,000+/bottle just for the quality.   There are exceptions though. Old red label Giacosa I think delivers at its price point, as does Rousseau Chambertin and Beze. Dujac Grand Cru from good vintages is $400+ and worthwhile if you have the cash to spend. At our lunch yesterday a server at the wine bar/restaurant we went to was really impressed by some '88 and '93 Dujac village wines someone brought so my friend invited her to our dinner, which had a dozen and a half bottles of GC Dujac from the mid-80s through early 2000s. Her mind was completely blown, and rightfully so. But you do reach a price point where you start to say ""I'd rather have three or four bottles of X than one bottle of Y for the same price."" Where that point is will differ by person and wine.  Incidentally, I think that's a pretty good price on the 04 Coche Chevalieres! Surprised to hear it was overoaked. Good stuff though!"
wine,3d1u22,flitcroft,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to imply overoaked, just noticeably oaked and ripe, which is a style that I love. It was very big, verging on buttery. K&L has the RP98 2012 Lauren vineyard if you feel like comparing and contrasting, or if you host another offline I'll track down something :) These allocated wines come and go quickly but '11, '12, and '13 were all great years in that area.

I tried a 2012 Newton Unfiltered Napa Chard last night, which Spectator raved about in the current '13 vintage, and it was massively disappointing. Just flabby and poorly made with crazy amounts of raw alcohol flavor.  In the $50ish range I'd go DuMol then Rombauer as a distant second. Other than those two I'd stick to solid $25 wines. The $50 range is light years away from Burgundy wines no matter what Parker writes."

wine,3d1u22,ChesterD,2,Mon Jul 13 01:38:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably applicable, at least to some degree, across the spectrum. If you compare a really great $200-300 wine (and yes, this applies at lower price points too) to a really great $2,000+ wine, the marginal increase in quality does not necessarily warrant the additional cost. That said, there are some levels of perfection at that level that are quite the experience, even if the QPR isn't great."

Incidentally, Jadot is or was a minority (about 20%) shareholder in Remoissenet. I would not be surprised if this was a second label either for export or to sell at a discount surplus production from other label (while protecting these labels from devaluation) or possible both. Remoissenet has sold lots of higher end stuff at discounts before under other labels in the past."

If your boyfriend likes the Duckhorn, this will slay him:  1994 Dunn Cabernet Sauvignon Howell Mountain. Less than $200, for sure. Here's Big Bob's review:  The 1994s might be ready to drink within 10-15 years. It is hard to believe these wines spend 30 months in oak casks before bottling as they are incredibly unevolved and backward when released. Look out for the behemoth 1994 Cabernet Sauvignon Howell Mountain. This black/purple-colored wine adds a few more nuances (minerals, licorice, and floral scents) to the lavish display of creme de cassis. Full-bodied, with a blockbuster level of extract and density, this is an outstanding Cabernet Sauvignon for readers with patience, good genes for longevity, or the foresight to purchase it for their children. Anticipated maturity: 2006-2030."

It's a sweeter wine that tastes of apples and stonefruits with beautiful funkiness that will knock your socks off.  Given your enjoyment of sweet/fruity wines this should be a slam dunk and since it only costs 85$ you can grab some 2002 ruinart champagne to start, with the extra 115$"

wine,3czp40,j3w,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"As /andtheodor says, it was a bad year in Bordeaux, and some other premium areas, but not everywhere.  Something that old is going to be quite developed. You'll be happy to know that acidity and tannin die down over time. However, fruit gives way to secondary characters, the animal and vegetal flavours like tobacco (bordeaux), mushroom (Burgundy). Duckhorn merlot is very 'fruit-forward'.   The 1994 Dominus is a great  recommendation. Napa cabs tend to be very fruity - the Parker style of late picked ultra-ripe berries. As they have huge fruit concentration, this should carry through even after all this time. But i've not had a single aged napa cab, but i'd love to try them."
wine,3czp40,ClotheTheTart,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:50:47 2015 UTC,"I'm really leaning toward the Dominus too, but it's really stretching my budget (especially with the Canadian dollar so low).

wine,3cx7o0,GahMatar,3,Sat Jul 11 18:22:27 2015 UTC,"They don't make 100 bottle low quality fridges (below a certain floor) like they do with 12-24 bottle ones. You need high quality because it will conk out way short of 10-20 years, or age them inconsistently because it will start to fail to keep temperature consistent, etc."
wine,3cx7o0,occasionallyrude,3,Sat Jul 11 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"Seriously?! You're asking for a two decade wine storage solution and proposing a 6 bottle appliance gimmick...  I'm sorry but it just doesn't work that way.  I'd suggest you look into the smallest off-site storage in your area to start getting your bearings.    Also, be aware (and you can find stories in this subreddit) that when these fridges fail, they can actually cook your wine - i.e. they become hotter than the surrounding air."
wine,3cx7o0,Muppet_Mower,3,Sun Jul 12 07:36:59 2015 UTC,"Suppose you want to age bottles for 10 years. Suppose you add 2-3 bottles a year that you want to age.  This year, any size will do... But 10 years from now when you open the first bottle, you'd have 30 (3 * 10) bottles in the fridge. And that's just adding 2-3 per year. More commonly, people add 6-12 bottles a year. And so over 10 years you'd need 60-120 bottles. And that's tiny! Just maybe 500-1000$/year in high-end wine purchases.  Serious collectors tend to add many cases per years and so accumulate the large (>200 bottles) cabinets or save money and build a room with room for several hundred to several thousand bottles (again, 60 bottle years, mean storage time 10 years is 600 bottles.)  It's also hard to keep temperature and humidity constant in small volumes. The small 12-24 size fridge are really just designed to store/cool bottles to be drunk over the next few weeks."

wine,3czvgc,chicagowine,2,Mon Jul 13 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"It is very subjective, think of wine like music or art. You will need to try lots of different kinds to have an understanding. Take music for example, how have your tastes changed since when you were a kid? Do you still rock what you listened to when you were 10? No, you heard country, rap, rock, etc... and since then you dove deeper into the sub categories you enjoy. The same is with wine, just try lots of stuff... There is no good/bad wine, there is only perspective. Also, the pretentious part of wine is absolute bs. Its really just about learning and growing, finding out about yourself and the people you care about. Just have fun with it!"
wine,3czvgc,Dubasaurus,2,Sun Jul 12 08:54:43 2015 UTC,"IMO, if you spend much more than $20 on a bottle without enough experience to know why you're paying more you're just throwing money away. Try a bunch of different wines in the $15-20 range and see what you like. At that price, most of the bottles you run into are fairly decent, if not mind-blowing, and you're less likely to run into something completely undrinkable as may happen in the $10 or less range. Go to wine bars and tasting rooms and try what they have to offer, that's why they exist.  I know California wines best so for them I recommend you start by trying (for reds) some Zinfandel, some Syrah, some Cabernet Sauvignon, and some Pinot Noir. Based on what you like best off what you've tried at first try different bottles from different wineries of the same variety.  If there's a shop that specializes in wine in your area, hit them up, tell them what you've told us and what you've tried and liked and see what they recommend. Most shops will be happy to guide you toward decent approachable wines."

In this community $150 on a bottle isn't anything particularly out the ordinary if they've bought a difficult to find wine, probably better not to drop prices down because it can come off looking a little pretentious)"

wine,3czvgc,sorrysary,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:00:22 2015 UTC,"Well, are you partial to sweeter drinks or are fruity drinks too much for you? That would maybe be a good indicator to what wines would be a good place to start.   I would say a $15-20 pinot grigio would be a good start for white. It's a good middle ground.   For red, I started with sangria which is pretty sweet and worked my way to drier (aka less sweet) reds, like cabernet sauvignon or old vine zinfandel.   But like everyone says, just buy some and try some. Research online! There are a lot of infographics on the subject."
wine,3czvgc,dunno260,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:38:15 2015 UTC,"Ask around and look for wine shops in your area.   Mine does free tastings at least once a week with 4-24 wines to sample.   But I don't think there is a universal wine.   I think you can find producers wine people will all agree are top notch, but that doesn't say anything for the wine you like.   But as a start for some producers that aren't expensive, widely available, and make solid wines at their price,  Chateau Ste Michelle, Columbia Crest, Beringer,  and Cline all have wines I have liked. I think Cline's Zinfandel is perfectly nice and easy drinking at $10.  It isn't the greatest, buy it has a lot of nice red fruit on the palate."
wine,3czvgc,osoroco,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:29:45 2015 UTC,"If available in your area, find a wine shop and ask if they offer tastings you could assist to. Best case is they'll have a day with free tastings to goad you into buying. They also might have one of those wine dispensers with a number of bottles and have your own tasting with a sip of each of the bottles there (these work by purchasing a prepaid card and using it to get the samples).    The tasting/classes might be better since you'll have people talking about what they're having and this will add value (and perhaps meaning) to what you're doing vs. going at it on your own, without a mentor."
wine,3czvgc,GahMatar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"Find a good wine shop, let them help you discover what you like. Come back to things you didn't like previously every few years. I didn't like wine when I was 20, I really got into it about when I turned 30. I don't drink much peaty scotch anymore either, used to polish off bottles of Laphroaig in a few sittings 10 years ago...  A good wine shop will be able to help you find interesting, varied and inexpensive wines to try and identify what you like. The sweet spot price wise is between 15 and 25$. Some kinds of wines are expensive to make (usually because land is really expensive or because it takes a lot of land to make few bottles) or highly in demand and can't be had cheap, doesn't mean you can't have something else in the same vein affordably.  Wine is an agricultural product and the quality of the fruit, the type, how ripe it was and even how and where it was grown have impact on wine taste. Wine-making is very much focused on highlighting these differences (outside of the very largest national brands.)  Vodka, Gin or Bourbon producers want to highlight their skills and technique and erase the input of the of the grains they started with. Beer is somewhat in the middle. Distillers and breweries buy their grains indirectly, they have little input on where the grain was from from batch to batch. Grain is also slow spoiling, grapes must be made into wine as soon as they are harvested (the process is long but must start ASAP.)"

wine,3ctqdf,arnaudh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:10:05 2015 UTC,"Nope. It's just that since like many small or medium-sized wineries we don't have our own bottling equipment and use a mobile bottling solution, it's not any cheaper for us to use screwtops. The bottling company needs to switch/adjust their equipment for the Stelvin system, so it's not any cheaper for us. Same for the glass.  We're very happy with the Stelvins for our whites. The only return I or our retailers have seen since we started bottling them that way is one bottle which was only about 4/5 filled - happened during the bottling process and it's our fault for not catching it."

Unsure if they've reduced the taint problem or if that's just a benefit of cork avoidance for every day wines.   I hid some low-end 2008 Oregon Pinots with screw-caps to see what would happen. After about five years, they picked up some allspice/cinnamon notes--basically what I expect when the local Pinots start to mature.

DIAM makes corks in such a way that there is zero percent chance of wine taint.  Btw, even wine under screw cap can still be tainted with TCA for TCA is not limited to cork but can also, for example, come from the barrels wine is aged in. Though of course if that happens, that's a huge problem for the winery while a single cork being tainted isn't that big a deal."

TCA-free cork isn't a basis of choice on the shelf though. The producer knows who made the cork. The consumer doesn't. Screw caps are obvious. Cork sourcing is obscure. At retail, all corks are the same, and the good ones are tainted by association. Thanks to rampant TCA a few years back, the screw-cap cat is out of the bag.

Possibly 8500 years of using twists of cloth, cloth tied over the top, leather, sealing wax, clay, glass stoppers, etc.  The oldest cork importing firm, Rankin and Sons, goes back to only 1813. They may have been the first to mass produce wooden corks from Quercus suber, or the same type we know and use today.

wine,3ctqdf,camwheeler,2,Fri Jul 10 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a pretty big misconception involving corks and cork taint. Cork taint is caused by TCA (trichloroanisole) or TBA (tribromoanisole) and is detectable by most people in the ppt(!) levels. TCA or TBA can be introduced at any point in the wine production process, and TCA can even be formed in wine by microbes using what's left over from chlorine-based cleaning agents (which is one reason why you generally won't see people using chlorine in the winery).  Cork taint's most likely vector has, historically, been the cork, yes, but it's certainly not the only way that TCA can be introduced, and as cork production techniques and treatments become more sophisticated I would wager that it's becoming a less important factor in corked wines than winery practices or barrels. Don't think screw caps are the holy grail to save you from ever having another corked wine."
wine,3ctqdf,oonniioonn,2,Sat Jul 11 04:38:47 2015 UTC,"Over the past 3 years I've had almost 100 wines that showed TCA and were under cork. 0 in that same time under screwcap (with about a 50/50 split of wines under both closures - minimal DIAM, crown seal, ardea etc) So when I hit one under screwcap I'll happily take that over whatever percentage I get with cork."

Many of the bottles in that number aren't my personal bottles though, some are from friends bottles at tastings, trade tastings, cellar doors (which should never happen but it does!).  I can't look up the exact split right now, but I'd guess about 40% European (majority France, Italy, Germany) and most of the rest Australian with a small number of other new world countries making up the total.  Total bottle count probably 4000 or so? Again can't look up exactly now. That includes plenty of tastings where faulty bottles should have been weeded out before presenting though, so no quite as easy as dividing and putting a % on it."

The State Liquor Stores, associated to states where these exist, used to sell it, and according to the Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control this wine has been discontinued.  There are apparently some bottles being sold here, but I couldn't get any of the buy links to work for some reason. I'm not sure if that's an issue with the website, but I would be skeptical that these are currently still for sale if this website doesn't easily allow purchases.   As I assume you know, Principato Rosato was produced by delle Venezie IGT exclusively for Olive Garden. If that contract is no longer in effect then no more Principato Rosato will be produced, but that doesn't mean that, that specific wine is no longer in production. This is most likely the exact wine you're looking for, only under a very slightly different name and a different bottle for contract purposes. I couldn't find a seller in the United States, but the price per bottle is relatively low and if you order a number of them at once then the shipping cost per unit shouldn't be overwhelming.

wine,3cs7cs,Needsmoretractor,14,Fri Jul 10 10:09:51 2015 UTC,It's an old bottle of a 4-5 euros sparkly from France. It will taste roughly like an old low-end NV champagne bottle well pas its prime.

wine,3cs7cs,winemule,2,Fri Jul 10 13:40:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's unlikely to be chardonnay... In the non-champagne sparkling wines of France, chardonnay is a relatively recent innovation, it's only really been used in any great quantity in the past 10-20 years. And the 'methode champenoise' on the bottle dates it to pre-1994 [this wording was banned then].  More likely to be some blend of local white grapes, Roussette or Jacquère or Roussanne, that sort of thing. Maybe some Aligote or Chasselas. Might be some chardonnay in too I guess... But probably in the minority, as it well predates the 'internationalizing' trend of french sparkling wine towards everything tasting like champagne..."
wine,3cs7cs,occasionallyrude,4,Fri Jul 10 21:16:04 2015 UTC,"It's an inexpensive sparkling wine made with the same methodology as champagne (""methode champagnoise""), so expect some biscuity and maybe yeasty flavours.  Blanc de blanc means it is made only with the Chardonnay grape, so maybe a little lighter in feel too with  emphasis on citrusy and apple-y fruit.  However, bearing in mind its likely price point, it may at best taste like a cheap non-vintage champagne; and that's assuming it's stored properly (cool, damp place; laid on its side; undisturbed for an extended period of time).  Its true worth may not so much be in its taste as its sentimental value.  Still, an interesting bottle.  :)"

So, in Woodinville if you go to the Hollywood Schoolhouse area, you'll mainly get the eastern WA wineries that do production over there. Where you'll want to go is the Warehouse Districts. Most of the wineries in the Warehouse District are producing the wines in the warehouse, right there. Some of my favorites:  North (Main) Warehouse district:   Patterson Cellars Davenport Cellars Baer Winery Flying Dreams Barrage Cellars Armstrong Family Winery   Then there's the southern warehouse district, which is just across North Woodinville Way on 142nd Ave NE. Eventually it'll be named ""Artisan Hill"" but I don't think they're there yet. Anywho, over there you'll find some gems like:   Convergence Zone Cellars Two Vintners Stevens Winery Pomum Cellars Pacific Distillery (Go get some Gin and Absinthe... seriously good stuff)   If you're in Seattle, go down to the Seattle Urban Wineries, where many of them produce onsite or at least close by. Some of my favorites from this area (although I've never visited their tasting rooms, I've had their wines and loved them):   Bartholomew Winery Cloudlift Cellars Nota Bene Cellars   Many of the above wineries will often have the winemakers there onsite, pouring the wines for you. Just be friendly, and tell them you're from out of town and would love to see where the wine is made, and if they're available, they may even give you a tour of the back and you'll be able to see where the wines are made. Most people are SUPER friendly there, so just be your happy normal self and you'll be treated right.   Make a plan for Woodinville, pick at most 5 wineries to hit in a three hour period and you may even get to them all. Also, check the hours of the wineries in the Warehouse Districts because many of them are only open on Saturdays. I'll be in the area, since I live here, so if you have any questions or want some tips, just PM me and I'll get in touch with you! Cheers!"

Elsewhere in Paso, I enthusiastically second chicagowine's recommendation of Tablas Creek.  Turley is great if you like big Zinfandels.  Denner makes some awesome Rhone-style wines. I love their Viognier and Syrah. Call well ahead of time and try to make an appointment.   I haven't gotten around to it yet, but I have heard good things about Linne Calodo.   For Cabernet, Justin is generally well respected but I have not tasted in a while.   DAOU is also known for Cab and has an excellent high-altitude view of the area."

We go to Paso once a year for the last 5 years and avg about 5 wineries a visit.   We use Yelp reviews to guide and they have never failed us. Big, beautiful, overbuilt wineries seems to equal more expensive wine that often are not much better than the winery down the road.  One important note is when you do find wines you like, you can probably buy them from the Paso or Atascadero Albertsons for a considerable discount, at least 30% less than at the winery. Also when a winery has been out of a desirable wine, I've found it at this store.  If we weren't in the business, (with industry discounts offered).  I'd only buy from Albertsons. We had a really great experience at Opolo, great family operation and really nice people, lots to try.  Not as fancy as Denner, but Denner had only one wine we bought, and once we brought it home, was not as special as we thought. Justin, while has great wines, is now owned by Fuji water, not worth the drive. Calcareous was a lunch stop (that we packed) as it's beautiful with a good view. Eberle was also worth the trip as it's also family owned/operated and they do barrel tastings.  We didn't make it to Daou but did find this and Calcareous at Albertsons. J Dusi Zins were ok. This area is Zin heavy, if you like Pinots and Cabs, you'll do well to come up to Ridge and David Bruce."

You'd be surprised how many different varietals AZ winemakers are planting and bottling. I'll try to find an article I read with a recent accounting of what we have planted and will edit.

Of the top of my head: cab, merlot, granache, Nebbiolo, Malvasia, Chenen blanc, cab Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Syrah, petit Syrah (I think), and the 2 others you mentioned.  I know I'm missing some and those are pretty much what I've seen with stronghold, pillsbury and Maynard's labels.

Some that are just now being explored as potential vineyard sites. We're very much in our infancy as a growing region, but we're starting to see some really great things coming from a select group of winemakers. One varietal that I did not see on the list that has been making a strong showing is Tannat. Kent Callaghan has been producing delicious Tannat down in the Sonoita AVA. If you haven't had a chance to try it, I would highly recommend it."
wine,3cpwj5,unclefire,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:18:10 2015 UTC,so many different micro-climates   Yeah def.  I forgot to mention that one.  I'm not sure I've had any from Sonoita.  Worth a try.
wine,3cqjwk,TomasTTEngin,5,Thu Jul 9 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about your stance on private labelling/soft branding. I'm not sure it's absolutely necessary that every winery sells under it's own branding. For one there's the economic argument. Marketing wine is expensive... If you don't have to do branding, you can spend more on actually making wine.  In the UK supermarket MSB is inevitably called something like 'Wairau Cove', 'Coolwater Bay', 'Cowrie Bay' etc. Is it really that much of a problem that no winery is named that? (And, indeed, no such place exists). I know all this, and still I sometimes buy them. Because   The winery does actually exist. The grapes were grown in Marlborough and vinified near there. You make it seem like the supermarkets are actually brewing it all in a shed out back. Sometimes you can even find out who makes what (e.g. Tesco's finest MSB is Yealands) but mostly that information is guarded by the winemakers, who don't want to undermine their own sales Usually good value for money, probably linked to the lack of having to pay for marketing Usually very 'representative' of the style. Supermarket buyers aren't looking for weird and quirky. If I want a MSB that 'tastes like MSB' and have £7 in my pocket then the supermarket's a good bet Possibly related, they're never mindblowing but almost never terrible   Finally, there's a double standard at play. What is it bad when retailers make wine, but fine when negociants do it? If I a bottle of Nicolas Potel Burgundy, nowhere on the label does it say where it's actually from - who grew the grapes, who made the wine? Even the 'Nicolas Potel' name is a lie (he left the company in 2009).   I can only really speak for the UK, but in the last 10-20 years supermarkets have been instrumental in raising the quality of wine available, particularly at the bottom end."
wine,3cqjwk,occasionallyrude,3,Fri Jul 10 00:52:30 2015 UTC,"This is a very valid criticism. To the extent that consumers are in the loop about what's happening and satisfied with it, there is no problem whatsoever.   As to the extent to which the wine is ""supermarket-made"" vs ""winery-made,"" much of the Aussie supermarket wine is made in one big facility which does huge quantities by Aussie standards. But it is in a winery region and has a winery name (dorrien estates). It's probably closer to what consumers imagine than a lot of other consumer product factories are to their brand images."

I don't have my notes on it, but it was an absolute treat when I tasted it a few months back. If you can find a bottle in the 1998-2003 range, count yourself lucky as it's probably right in the middle of its drinking window – the '07 may still be a bit young."

Here's the Advocate's review of the 2007:  ""The beautiful 2007 Amarone della Valpolicella Riserva San Floriano already shows the sheer magic of bottle-aging with touches of leather, spice and dried fruit that play perfectly off one another. The wine is so incredibly lively and bright in the mouth: it is teaming with vitality and energy. Dark notes of tar and resin make appropriate background tones. This is a masterpiece Amarone that still has a long way to go. Drink 2015-2028. 95+ points.  Brigaldara holds the Valpolicella banner high and makes some of the best Amarone available today. The 50-hectare estate is owned by the Cesari family and is home to extensive vineyards and olive groves. This beautiful collection of wines is absolutely unbeatable thanks to the excellent vintages (2010, 2009 and 2007) on offer now.""  You should be able to find one for just under $150."

wine,3cnlvg,ourmodelcitizen,2,Thu Jul 9 18:44:16 2015 UTC,"You've probably been told this, but Amarone pretty much falls into two basic categories: traditional style and ""port"" style. The former goes better with food, the latter is a bit sweeter, more pleasing to the palate to drink on its own. So if you spend a lot on an Amarone, you best find out what style it's in so you can fully appreciate it, especially if you're spending that kind of money on it.  And if I was spending that much on an Amarone, I'd do Corte Sant'Alda ""Mithas"" Amarone. Beautiful, stunning wine, one of the best I've ever had from any region, really. So tight and beautiful and supple all at the same time. Definitely will be running you in the $150 price point, maybe more.  As someone else has said, it will be worth it to you if you feel it tastes worth it. And for me, if I'm spending that much on a bottle, I want it to be from a small producer, someone who is hand-picking, hand-making, and hand-bottling that wine. No point in giving that much money to a massive producer that didn't put the love and care into it that it deserves, just for a big brand name."

In recent years I have discovered amazing wines from Portugal, from vibrant whites to exciting reds. Baga grape can be quite tannic and acidic. It reminds me of nebbiolo. This particular wine has some age, and showcases a softer texture. For just under $20, it is really great value!”  Paul Bara, Special Club 2004 $100  “An amazing Champagne! Special Club or Club Tresor is a special cuvee that can only be released in perfect years from Champagne growers. Paul Bara represents quality every single time I open anything he makes. While his Special Club is not cheap, it’s still a value among bigger names in Champagne.”  Barolo Monprivato Giuseppe Mascarello 2009 $135  “I love this wine. It has an amazing balance, and will age for a very long time. Buy a lot, enjoy it all, or put a few on the side to open years down the road.”  Comte Abbatucci, “Rouge Frais Imperial,” Vin de France 2014 $20  “I absolutely love Corsican wines. They are interesting, maybe slightly funky, but perfect for the summer. This one is made from sciaccarello grapes that are only grown on the island of Corsica. Serve this wine slightly chilled and it will go well with pretty much everything on your picnic table.”  Jacques Puffeney Trousseau Cuvée Les Berangeres, Jura 2012 $40  “Grab every bottle you can find of this wine, because 2014 was the last vintage and these wines are amazing! Dark fruit notes with spices and tones of minerality make this wine a great companion at any dinner table. Plus, it is just really cool.”  Argyros, Assyrtiko, Santorini 2013 $18  “Greece is so exciting right now. Wines that are coming from Santorini are fresh, vibrant, and lean. This wine is no exception – packed with citrus notes and light, herbaceous character, it is a perfect alternative for Sauvignon Blanc lovers, but gives you an opportunity to try something new and exciting.”  Celler Piñol Terra Alta L'Avi Arrufi Carinena 2008 $50  “A Grenache and Syrah blend from Catalunya, Spain. This is a superb wine for the money. Silky, rounded, and structured. It is a full-bodied red, but has great acidity that gives the wine perfect balance. A great alternative for Cabernet Sauvignon lovers, and it doesn’t demand a huge price tag.”  Grignolino, Castello di Neive 2013 $16  “It is bright and light-bodied with a beautiful floral and fresh berry bouquet. Another red that is perfect slightly chilled, and is ideal for the summer.”  Domaine Philippe Gilbert, Menetou-Salon 2014 $18  “An amazing rosé from Pinot Noir grapes. Menetou-Salon is an appellation located next to famous Sancerre, and produces amazing value wines. This rosé is unbelievably good!”  Muscadet Sèvre-et-Maine, Comte Leloup, Sur Lie Cuvee des Ceps Centenaires 2007 $17  “Melon de Bourgogne or Muscadet are the biggest values that you can find. This particular wine is made from 100-year-old ungrafted vines and spends years on the lees. It is amazing how good this wine is at just under $20. It is almost a sin to charge so little, considering the amazing terroir it comes from and the work that goes into making it.”  Pignoletto dell'Emilia, Fattoria Moretto, Emilia-Romagna 2013 $14  “It’s no secret I love bubbles, but it is hard to find great-tasting bubbles without paying a lot. This Pignoletto is a true find! Easy to drink with great minerality, it beats any prosecco out there. Plus you have a chance to taste something different without spending much!”  Roc de Cambes, Cotes de Bourg $200  “Bordeaux is expansive, and wines need time before they really show full potential. I try to look for values in the right bank like Lalande-de-Pomerol or Saint Émilion. This wine comes from the lesser-known appellation of Cotes de Bourg. The area Roc de Cambes is quite expansive, but the quality of this wine can compete with a lot of wines from greater appellations in Bordeaux. Plus, you can find older vintages for really amazing prices. 1988 costs $206 and you really can’t find another Bordeaux for the same price and quality.”  Quinta do Crasto Reserva VV 2009 $55  “Portuguese table wines are definitely worth keeping your eyes on. They offer an amazing value and always over-deliver. This wine is made from old vines that give you a full and beautifully rounded red, packed with red fruits, lovely acidity, and silky tannins.”  Castellroig Cava Brut Nature 2012 $15  “An amazing cava! Completely bone-dry, delicate aromas of jasmine, grapefruit, and apple make this wine the perfect aperitif. On the palate the acidity is vibrant and the absence of sweetness is perfect for pairing with seafood, especially oysters. It is best partnered with paella, or with some crackers and cheese.

There are definitely some village level Burgundies that will have that floral profile—hopefully someone here can suggest something specific they've had in the past.   In general, I'd avoid most of CA and OR, as CA tends to be too fruity and OR goes more for the earth than the floral notes (in my experience).  If you're interested in finding the floral notes in some other wines I would suggest trying some Loire Valley reds. Cabernet Franc often has a strong flowery nose and there are some examples from Chinon that can be almost as delicate as a Pinot Noir.  Edit: I'm sure there are plenty of examples of CA and OR Pinots with strong floral qualities (such as Byron), I meant more that they're not categories known for that note specifically."

wine,3cep30,arnaudh,4,Tue Jul 7 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unless the cellar itself (and that has happened) is contaminated, it's extremely unlikely.  When we switched to Stelvin closures for our whites, we stopped having people returning a bottle once in a while for TCA. Better yet, the wine is 100% consistent from one bottle to the next. That's not always the case when using natural cork. It's especially unforgiving for white wines.  We're still using natural cork (Da Silva's) for our reds, but that's purely for marketing reasons. We know some consumers wouldn't take us seriously otherwise, which frankly is a shame. I think it will evolve. A lot of millenials don't give a crap and know you can't judge a book by its cover."

The NZ screwcap initiative in 2001 was embraced by lots of people here (story from Jancis), they had pretty fun parties which helped, and they were as much about research as they were about marketing - until of course the research became totally conclusive.  No-one in the market regrets the change at all any more, certainly not the consumer and it hasn't hurt anyone's sales apart from maybe the folks at Pulltap.  In NZ we've done a pretty good job educating the public that the product reaching them is exactly as the winemakers intended, and plenty of the NZ public are pretty stupid, so there's hope for you Americans and Chinese yet.

I just recork with the original cork, making sure the same end that was in the bottle goes back in.   Funny story,  I was in construction for the better part of 20 years, and one of our clients was a former Marketing Director (I think) for the Gallo family in the 70's-80's and later. Around the time the cork shortage debate began the was a meeting he was to attend with one of the Gallo Bros, during this meeting, many very prominent wine makers and distributors and the like were all lamenting the shortage and sharing ideas. This Gallo brother, who was sitting next to my client, stood up in the middle of the conversation and announces that his company has already solved the problem. Heads turn, and everyone is listening intently as he describes a new bottle that has a glass cork that is grooved to screw on the inside of the bottle. My client is sitting there, bewildered, since he never heard of this. Everyone asks when it will be released, they want to know when they can get their hands on the bottle. The Brother says they are testing in NY, RI, and NJ (I think those were the states he mentioned) but they ran in to one hiccup.  They ask what the problem is; the Brother states ""..Whenever, you go to pour the wine, it splashes all over the place!"" and starts laughing.

wine,3cep30,ferchristssakestopit,2,Tue Jul 7 15:25:11 2015 UTC,"From a chemistry and physics perspective the vacuum corks are nearly, if not completely, useless because you are not achieving a full vacuum and thus at best are mildly retarding the rate of oxidation; the mix of air in terms of o2 n2 etc is the same, you just have a slightly smaller volume of it.   Inert gases are super effective, if used properly. That is, however, a big if. You need to completely replace the oxygen with the gas (or prevent air from ever entering a la coravin). This will certainly prevent the wine from spoiling but it is not easily achieved by simply blowing some argon in the top and sticking in the cork.  Edit to add: I've also heard it said that the vacuums mute the nose of the wine because they suck up the VOCs that provide scent but I don't know enough about how smell works to really confirm that."
wine,3cep30,cnralex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:23:01 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of great info! VOC's are by nature unstable and break down quickly when exposed to oxygen, and will, over time lead to the wine falling 'flat'. The amount of vacuum pressure needed to remove all VOC's?

wine,3cep30,rdmarshman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:03:25 2015 UTC,"co2? I don't expect you to be talking about sparkling wines. Regardless if it sucks out the co2 as well, wouldn't vacuuming aid in slowing the oxygenation of the wine (therefore preserving)?"
wine,3cep30,cnralex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"This person sums it up nicely.   [–]sapereaud33Wine Pro 1 point 3 hours ago  *From a chemistry and physics perspective the vacuum corks are nearly, if not completely, useless because you are not achieving a full vacuum and thus at best are mildly retarding the rate of oxidation; the mix of air in terms of o2 n2 etc is the same, you just have a slightly smaller volume of it.  Inert gases are super effective, if used properly. That is, however, a big if. You need to completely replace the oxygen with the gas (or prevent air from ever entering a la coravin). This will certainly prevent the wine from spoiling but it is not easily achieved by simply blowing some argon in the top and sticking in the cork.  Edit to add: I've also heard it said that the vacuums mute the nose of the wine because they suck up the VOCs that provide scent but I don't know enough about how smell works to really confirm that."
wine,3cep30,osoroco,0,Wed Jul 8 03:14:12 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately screwcaps haven't been used on premium wines long enough to know. Australian riesling is a good place to look, I've had some over ten years of age and the wines have developed fine, maybe retaining a bit more acidity and freshness than their cork counterparts."
wine,3cep30,cnralex,2,Tue Jul 7 14:29:22 2015 UTC,"ideal conditions aside, my concern is the cap itself rusting or deteriorating and imparting rusty flavor onto the wine."
wine,3cep30,osoroco,11,Tue Jul 7 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"All screwcaps have a synthetic lining on the inside, which do have some permeability so oxygen can actually pass through similar to that of a perfect cork (source). No metal will come into contact with your wine provided the cap itself hasn't been damaged by external forces.  Edit: A word"

wine,3cdrlb,CorkTaint,2,Tue Jul 7 07:24:14 2015 UTC,I just finished wset 2 and 3. If you have the spare time to study the text books they are super helpful courses. In level 3 you taste over 80 different wines and take notes. I studied my ass off and know significantly more about wine now as a result. You also learn how to blind taste wines which helps you describe them to customers.   Both are considered helpful for peeping for the court of master somm certifications which are the fine dining somm bench marks.   Everything in hospitality is who you know and doing these courses helps you network and makes you smarter and more employable. But only if you are able to study and pass.

The Level 3 exam goes fairly deep into the detail.  Pay particular attention to viticulture, viniculture, wine storage, food pairing and social responsibility (first 12 chapters of the book - though note my textbook was from 2 years ago), as there are some hard facts you need to memorise.  Sound knowledge on them will really help you understand the main wines section."

wine,3cb7w2,dexcel,2,Mon Jul 6 20:20:57 2015 UTC,Torbeck - woodcutters Shiraz   Teusner -Albert Shiraz (might be a bit more than 30) but most wines from Teusner are very good quality  D'arenberg -the footbolt Shiraz.   A lot of people line Pepperjack Shiraz. I've never understood the hype but I see a lot of people having it.   These should be available internationally
wine,3cb7w2,the_monster_consumer,2,Tue Jul 7 07:49:51 2015 UTC,"John Duval , should available internationally   Two Hands- garden series, but pricer though. By about $10 or so"

Ie hill of grace and grange are stupidly expensive   I like the Langmeil line of wines. They have a Valley Floor Shiraz which is very nice and around the $30 mark  Rockford has a Basket Press Shiraz which is meant to be excellent
wine,3cb7w2,sgarbusisadick,3,Mon Jul 6 21:04:24 2015 UTC,"Halliday, aka Australia's Robert Parker. I'm sick of Halliday points, too many SB's out there at 96+ points, not to mention all the other ridiculously pointed wines. Furthermore are they Halliday points and notes or are they from his virtual army of tasters? It's obvious he can't taste ~35,000 wines per annum.  I actively avoid wines with Halliday shelf talkers. If you want to follow an Australian critic, have a look a Jeremy Oliver.  All that said the Rockford Basket Press is exceptional. Much more fruit driven and less oaked that Grange or Hill of Grace."

wine,3cb7w2,liquid_massage,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:38:44 2015 UTC,"What confuses me about Halliday is just how different his international rep is from his domestic persona. Apparently he's arguably drank more DRC than any other Australian and he's recognised around the world as a Red Burgundy/Pinot Noir expert. His palette is highly respect in places like the Willamette Valley. I just find it strange.  And yes, those eyebrows are next level d00d. Some people have drawn the conclusion that his points have grown in step with those eyebrows!"

The only sub $30 bottle recommended thus far is Langmeil Valley Floor, a good drop but no better than any of the below.  Shanahan's Silence is Golden, beautiful big Barossa shiraz about $25  Mount Langi Ghiran Cliff Edge, lovely refined cooler climate style about $28  Lerida Estate Lake George Shiraz, elegant and highly perfumed very light cool climate shiraz about $30  Kalleske Pirathon, excellent old vine shiraz very concentrated fruit about $29  That should get you started, there are heaps though - all of these will be available at Dan's, if you've got more retail options available there's even more. We don't suffer for a lack of good shiraz down here!  And yes, John Duval Entity is superb but normally about $45.

Most of them are bone dry and don't have the residual sugar levels of their international counterparts. Basically anything from the Eden or Clare Valleys would be a good place to look. Here in Australia the absolute best examples top out at around the $50/bottle price point and you can routinely find great bottles under $20. They're my summer go to and pair magnificently with hot (chilli) foods.
wine,3ca0lv,pluggerlockett,2,Mon Jul 6 07:11:48 2015 UTC,This unofficial map might help too
wine,3ca0lv,tri_wine,2,Mon Jul 6 07:12:25 2015 UTC,"And yes, while I do recognise that the complexity of Burgundy is real I think the amount of analysis of Burgundy either written or translated into English far exceeds the available information in English regarding Barolo and Barbaresco. Basically put if you want to learn about Burgundy you can open a browser and find a multitude of resources that will fit your knowledge base. Comparatively Barolo/Barbaresco is much less well documented.  I'd also state that the changes in classifications in Barolo/Barbaresco have further confounded/confused the region with the labeling changes that were forced in 1980 when the region was granted DOCG status. Conversely Burgundy hasn't markedly changed from a classification perspective since 1935."
wine,3ca0lv,tri_wine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:19:35 2015 UTC,"Part of what makes Burgundy so damn confusing, though, is the whole mess of Napoleonic inheritance laws that resulted in a single family name split into a dozen different wine labels as kids and grandkids inherited smaller and smaller pieces of all the vineyards."
wine,3ca0lv,Socrates5150,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:48:25 2015 UTC,"True. That said the vast majority of Burgundy is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay and everything Premier Cru and above being single vineyard bottlings. Conversely Barolo has historically been about blends with each year's blends possibly being different in terms of percentage of constituent inputs. Then the DOCG change occurred where emphasis was placed on producing single vineyard crus. Some people went with that, others stayed with traditional blending. Basically everyone had to change their labels though."
wine,3ca0lv,tri_wine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:17:23 2015 UTC,Barolo is a blend??  For real?  I thought it was 100% Nebbiolo.

wine,3c8t2z,lechattueur,6,Mon Jul 6 00:32:33 2015 UTC,I Like Whole Foods Three Wishes. Better than two buck chuck.  Other than that I usually walk through Meijer or Kroger and look for heavily on sale wines.   Usually a better quality than those that are always five dollars.
wine,3c8t2z,scomperpotamus,6,Mon Jul 6 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"the Three Wishes is the exact same wine as Kroger's Bay Bridge, Wal-Mart's Oak Leaf, HEB's cul-de-sac, etc. If you look, they are all in the exact same bottle with slightly different labels  Edit: I used to work for an alcohol distributor that was responsible for these brands"
wine,3c8t2z,notgmoney,0,Mon Jul 6 14:43:51 2015 UTC,Well that's exciting!  I've never tried krogers but we shop there all the time and the closest whole foods is ten min further!
wine,3c8t2z,scomperpotamus,-1,Mon Jul 6 15:25:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I find that the sale wines tend to be wines that either suck and nobody wanted, or didn't move and are past their prime. I'd rather go with consistently mediocre Two Buck Chuck than the sale bin death sentence."
wine,3c8t2z,sarasmirks,4,Mon Jul 6 07:59:47 2015 UTC,"As a wine steward at Kroger, i can assure you this is not the case.  All the wines we carry are always offered at a yellow tag ""sale"" price plus the more popular wines like Barefoot and Rex Goliath are on sale in cycles, usually with deeper discounts."
wine,3c8t2z,annisarsha2,2,Mon Jul 6 11:43:45 2015 UTC,I used to be a wine steward for Kroger in Atlanta!
wine,3c8t2z,CouldYouN0t,2,Thu Jul 9 19:56:52 2015 UTC,I'm Mid Atlantic.  Zone G REPRESENT!!
wine,3c8t2z,annisarsha2,-1,Thu Jul 9 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"Yellow tag deals are different from sale wines, though. Because at Kroger (I'm a frequent Kroger shopper), all the wines have a yellow tag price for members.   I'm talking about the corner faceouts where a particular wine is on special this week. Which is actually something I've never seen at Kroger.  Also, sorry, but Barefoot and Rex-Goliath are garbage and not good and it doesn't matter whether they're on special this week or not."
wine,3c8t2z,sarasmirks,3,Mon Jul 6 15:52:08 2015 UTC,"You're not really a ""member"" which would indicate you had to pay a fee of some sort to get sale prices.  The yellow tag is a Kroger plus price that you get simply by having a Kroger card, free of charge.  All this does is allow Kroger to gear coupons directly towards what you tend to buy and yes, it allows us insight into our shopper's habits.  Now, I don't know where you live but here in Virginia we are not allowed to offer alcohol at ""sale"" prices, so the yellow tag price on beer and wine is for everyone.  If you look closely at the yellow tags and signage throughout the store you will see a statement that says ""with Kroger Plus card"" on all other merchandise.  And yes, Barefoot and RG are bottom of the barrel wines but your earlier statement about putting certain wines on sale to get rid of them is not true.  We put these wines on sale because they are our top sellers and they fly out of the store.  A lot of people actually like them."
wine,3c8t2z,annisarsha2,-2,Mon Jul 6 18:16:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, having a Kroger card = being a ""member"". I'm sure that's not what corporate HQ calls it, but that's not a sale, that's a loyalty discount. Kroger also gives you a quantity discount for buying 6 bottles, but that, too, is not the same thing as wine being ""on sale"".   On sale means priced lower than it typically is for a temporary period of time. Routine discounts that always exist for everyone is not a sale, by definition."
wine,3c8t2z,sarasmirks,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"The wine supplier pressures the distributor to move more product. The distributor pushes back saying we need it cheaper. They agree.   The distributor moves down the ladder and offers discounts to the grocery chains if they purchase in large quantities and place it on sale or in the ad, while keeping the margin roughly the same or better.   The consumer comes in, sees wine on sale and thinks, ""Oh, it must be on sale because it isn't good.."" and the consumer is incorrect."
wine,3c8t2z,notgmoney,-1,Mon Jul 6 20:32:43 2015 UTC,"I have to say -- and maybe this is just because supermarket wine is Russian Roulette anyway -- 99% of the time if I buy sale wine at a liquor store or supermarket, it's going to be undrinkable garbage. After being burned many times, I don't even look at anything marked down from its usual price. I'm sorry if that offends you as someone who works in the wine section of a supermarket, but it's pretty universally true in my experience."
wine,3c8t2z,sarasmirks,2,Mon Jul 6 21:16:06 2015 UTC,"Lol, you call Barefoot and Rex garbage, yet you will continually buy Two Buck Chuck. Right. Also, as a former Kroger wine steward, your assumptions about wine pricing are wrong. Just because you think you know it all doesn't mean you do."

The only thing a cork has on a screwcap wine is the romanticism of pulling out a cork - although that goes to shit pretty quick when the cork doesn't want to play ball (or has ruined the wine altogether). This needs to be preached, a majority of the old-school-cork-sealing producers will only change when the consumers/market demands one."

wine,3c5u93,cnralex,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:18:47 2015 UTC,I've spoken to some head winemakers at very large prominent wineries who do lots of experimentation on wines ageing under screwcap versus cork and whilst the screwcapped wines do age they age differently it is slower and apparently taste a little disjointed with the wine not all married together as well.
wine,3c5u93,hugofount,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"A very different point of view: http://www.winefront.com.au/the-great-marius-cork-vs-screwcap-battle/#.VZvtae2qqkp  My personal experience does not line up with what you say as well. Could it be that the screwcap wines they're trying were just disjointed/imbalanced anyway? I mean, that's how screwcap got its 'terrible' reputation in the first place. The best comparison is the one above - same wine, same vintage, different closures. Only thing missing was replication."
wine,3c5u93,cnralex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:03:14 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about head winemakers making top wines in their regions, £40-£400+. They would of course be tasting wines from the same vintage on the same day etc.  Of course this is just anecdotal, but I've spoken to a few who have said the same thing. I haven't taken part in this myself having not had the opportunity yet.  I honestly have no issue with screwcaps and feel that wines can age well under them.  I would so though in relation to the article that I honestly don't feel that an experiment of a case of a single wine is really definitive at all and isn't that useful."

wine,3c5u93,z6joker9,2,Sun Jul 5 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I must find this study and read it for myself.  I thought screw caps were meant more for wines to be consumed within ~1.5 years after bottling, not for long-term aging."
wine,3c5u93,ChalkyTannins,6,Mon Jul 6 00:29:13 2015 UTC,"We are at a relatives house for the holiday and we're drinking a bottle with a cork floating around in it, since they didn't have a corkscrew."
wine,3c5u93,cnralex,5,Sun Jul 5 04:58:49 2015 UTC,"Why do people enjoy purchasing Vinyl records when CD/MP3/flac/streaming are functionally superior in every way?  Because it's beautiful, it's fun, there is a sense of history, and tactile physicality that, analogous with corks and wine, that makes for a very enjoyable experience compared to the modern methods."
wine,3c5u93,ChalkyTannins,2,Sun Jul 5 22:50:35 2015 UTC,"But what if every now and then, through no fault of your own, that vinyl record breaks and is completely unusable, before you had even heard it! And you had been waiting years and years and years to play it, and to go buy another one you would have to pay ridiculously inflated prices on the secondary market (or, it's just not available).  What if your idea of the 'perfect' vinyl record is one that plays a sound that is the same as a high definition MP3 recording. That's the case with wine.  Your example isn't analogous, vinyl delivers a different sound to that of a CD or MP3, which some prefer and is fine, but it's a different story with wine because no one drinks wine to open the cork, they drink it for its contents. For vinyl to be analogous with wine, the sound produced by the vinyl record would have to be perfect, and if you could hear (i.e. taste) any impact from the vinyl record (i.e. cork) it would be deemed flawed. But that makes using vinyl itself completely redundant, hence why corks are also redundant!  I get the romanticism with opening a cork bottle vs. cracking a screwcap, but anyone who thinks the way you open a bottle of wine is even close to being as important as its contents has no appreciation for wine itself - only the superficialities of it."
wine,3c5u93,cnralex,2,Mon Jul 6 09:34:12 2015 UTC,"Vinyl degrades, over time and through repeated use. It can fall off the shelf and break, or dent or get scratched. Different pressings are worth more due to their perceived sonic qualities, and thus is reflected by their inflated price points. Many people collect vinyl and only listen to their digital copies.  Obviously they're not perfect analogies, as wine is a 1x consumable product, but there are very similar qualities. Another being the ritual and specialized tools involved in both cases. It's fun to have a nice pull tap and Ah-So, fancy decanter etc, and the ritual behind opening it is very similar to pulling out a vinyl record from its large beautiful cover, blowing off the dust, setting the needle etc....vs clicking a button on your iDevice or in the case of wine, quickly spinning off an aluminum cap.  Point I disagree on most though is that people drink wine for its contents. Obviously that's a major part, but the whole experience of the wine is important, from the packaging design (of which closure type is a part of), to the label's prestige and brand strength, to the glassware, and also the occasion for drinking the beverage and the people you're drinking with. It would be quite boring to drink wines blindly out of numbered shiner bottles with screw caps."
wine,3c5u93,Canerbry,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:06:41 2015 UTC,"My point was about the method of opening vs the contents. You can keep all of those things you mentioned while using screwcap - label, glassware, company, brand/producer, decanter etc. It's all important, but all of that stays. I'd hope that changing one small and pretty insignificant aspect of the wine doesn't mean the entire wine drinking process is ruined for anyone, but if it does ruin it then I'd say that person is more concerned about how it looks to be drinking wine than the actual wine itself. The only thing that changes is instead of pulling out a cork you're twisting a cap. That, and TCA.   No one can make the argument that that aspect of wine drinking alone (i.e. opening the wine) validates corks as a form of closure over screwcap. The sheer weight of benefits from screwcap makes the choice of using cork seem, if anything, irresponsible as the producer is knowingly sealing their product that they know could destroy everything that wine is supposed to represent. No one has fond memories of corked wines, only ones of disappointment, frustration and 'what could have been'."
wine,3c5u93,ChalkyTannins,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:25:24 2015 UTC,"See for me it's the aroma and flavour of the wine that is the more enjoyable experience than removing of the cork.  Vinyl sounds better than digital to many people, which is not a claim that anyone can try to make about wine sealed under cork with any dignity intact."
wine,3c5u93,iridescentcosmicslop,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:54:47 2015 UTC,"Opinions about vinyl sounding better than digital only exist because of  commonly propagated, ill-conceived misinformation, very much like cork vs screwcaps. Digital is vastly superior in dynamic range and reproduction of the sonic qualities the artist originally desired, and digital does not degrade upon repeated use.  Flavor and aroma matter of course, but so does tasting the label. Opening and drinking a Petrus or Lafite or DRC without knowing that it was a Petrus or Lafite or DRC, would not be NEARLY as special or enjoyable as knowing what you're drinking.  For me, drinking labels is PART of the fun and excitement."
wine,3c5u93,andtheodor,3,Mon Jul 6 09:49:13 2015 UTC,I've had a few corks break in half. Here's what I do:      -wet any exposed glass above the cork. -fill in the missing cork with hotglue. -wait for it to cool and remove it like a normal cork.      Never had cork in my wine since.
wine,3c5u93,sarasmirks,2,Sun Jul 5 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"I just go back in with the corkscrew and gently exert horizontal pressure until I get the tip to bite in and then get a few twists in and pull.

wine,3c5u93,oonniioonn,-8,Mon Jul 6 08:05:35 2015 UTC,"First of all: fuck screw caps.  Second: if you rip off half the cork, you clearly suck at opening them and are yourself an ignorant fucktard who can't open wine for shit. The only way you can do that is if you only screwed the corkscrew in half way and then try to pull it out. You can get away with that on fresh, new corks but an older cork will fuck you right up your ass for being incompetent.   Last: no, it won't affect the wine itself though you may find small bits of cork that broke off floating around."

There are no corkscrews with worms long enough such that if you screw them in all the way this can't happen, unless you're using something that actually pushes the worm through the bottom of the cork like a Screwpull (which works great except for the fact that it gets little bits of cork in the wine from where the worm punched through the bottom of the cork, plus some corks fall apart even with it).  I screw the worm in all the way, this doesn't matter with these corks as the worm is still only about 2/3rds to 3/4ths of the length of the cork at best.   The only people saying ""fuck screw caps"" at this point are those who are ignorant and/or irrationally attached to corks due to sentiment, that's it."

Unless you have corks that go halfway down the bottle, every regular (non-pocketknife) cork screw is long enough to poke through the bottom. And because I'm sure you're going to contest that fact, here's a picture I just made demonstrating as such: http://i.imgur.com/IDmYO18.jpg. This is a long (top) and regular (bottom) cork, along with the cork screw I use almost every day.

The 2011 was tasty, typical of a médoc (and maybe Margaux--I don't know very many of those). Dark, almost ripe fruit. Blackberries. Nice and dry on the palate with all those lovely tannins.

While showing support for the cause is admirable (and I do support the moderators cause), I can't see any real impact from a small niche subreddit like this one. The inconvenience of a closed sub and no content for the majority of subscribers here (who probably don't care about reddit drama) outweighs the small chance of any potential positive impact to be gained in terms of getting better communication between reddit moderators and the corporate team.  If changes are made to how moderators operate here (hopefully in a positive manner), you can bet it'll be site wide.

Let's pretend their is one position in the French government that has to deal with Burgundy. This person is extremely visible, in not just the wine world, but connects the outside world with French wine as well. They get information out to the big wine publications and encourage big names the world over to connect with wine growers and the smaller wine regions. Now let's say the French government has been pretty shitty to all of their wine regions. They don't listen to the regions needs and treat all of them pretty shitty for a long time. They then go and fire that one person in their government that was in charge of promoting Burgundy. Now Alsace can't get in contact with Wine Spectator. Bergerac can't have their big wine festival. It is a major blow to all the producing regions. To protest this, Bordeaux has closed its doors. Champaigne has as well. One after another of the big regions have gotten together and closed there doors until the government changes their current trends, and helped their wine growers versus hurting them. That is sorta what happened. The mods of reddit haven't been getting help from the admins for a long time, and now with the suprise dismissal of Victoria, even the major subs have been drastically affected. Hope that made sense. I am still on my first cup of coffee."

The article states most of the wine tested were in the 50-100mg/L range which is a normal amount of free for a bottled wine.    It really depends on the wine for the sensory threshold, so it's hard to say what would affect the taste, it's pretty safe to say most wines containing over 100mg/L will have a noticeable flavor and aroma, I'm not sure I could guess where total would be detectable."

wine,3bw90d,2sour2sweet4alcohol,6,Fri Jul 3 15:35:16 2015 UTC,"There are a million options here but it'll depend on the salmon really and the best part is there really are no wrong answers.  For stronger flavored Pacific salmon I tend to do a (red) Burgundy but there are some nice Oregon Pinots that are also great. I'd say Burgundy if there are some savory herbs or if baked with mushrooms (which I do and love often). You want white though and that's fine.  For whites with salmon and citrus, you are well set with bubbles (a Crémant de Loire, Blanc de Blanc or similar would be a good start) but I actually prefer still wine with salmon despite the popularity of bubbles. That's up to you.  Chardonnay is still the king here though, be it Chablis or a Fumé Blanc or somewhere in between. That or a Sancerre or similar Sauv Blanc would be ideal and of course a white Bordeaux isn't exactly a stretch. Some people love a NZ SB for salmon but meh, I like their wines but not here unless going for an Atlantic salmon, poached.  Again though, there are no wrong answers. Dry Riesling, Gewürzt, Chenin, Rosé from Garnacha... you can do almost anything with salmon depending on sauce, accompaniments and personal tastes. Nothing too sweet and nothing too tannic, acidity is desirable and herbaceous notes a plus."

It is still a blend of chardonnay and chardonnay musque, but the aromatics are not as pronounced in this one.  The wine is still crisp and acidic, yet has that full mouth feel of an oaked chard.  It tastes of caramel apple, followed by peaches and apricots with honey and vanilla.  OVERALL  Another excellent wine from Marynissen.

Edit: I lied. Latour around $1200 restaurant, 1996 Mouton for 900 (maybe I'm assuming a make-up that doesn't exist). To be fair, I have no clue how long we've had them for."
wine,3btvzm,cork_dork,2,Fri Jul 3 11:18:06 2015 UTC,"I work at a wine shop that specialized in first growth's. Basically, It's going to be very difficult to find a current release for under 500. You could buy what we call futures or pre-arrival, which is to say by a bottle of wine that hasn't been released yet. Most major retailers in the US do these kinds of programs, the only thing is you'll have to wait for it. For example, we are selling the 2014 Chateau Lafite for 350 on pre-arrival, but won't ship that until 2017 probably. You can look at wine-searcher.com to compare prices of bottles easily if you want to verify the info I've given you. Also, the best vintages for Bordeaux are: 1982, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1996, 2000, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2014. But those will also be the most expensive."

As another Redditor said, you're at least $500 short on budget for a good vintage of a first growth, but the second labels tend to fall in the $250-500 range for good years (look for 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2010).  Also, I'd say look at the top wines of the right bank, like Angelus, Cheval Blanc, and Ausone. Under-priced for top-tier Bordeaux, mainly because they're on the other side of the river, they may be in your range.  Another option would be to seek out very highly rated Bordeaux and buy several bottles (eg, the 100-point 2010 Leoville Barton runs $150 in my neck of the woods. Boom, three bottles, and you've got $50 left over to pay for shipping.).  But, yeah, you're not going to find a drinkable, legitimate first growth from a top year for $500."

wine,3brv0h,Fragunov,4,Wed Jul 1 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"If you want to get in to wine as a consumer and not working in the industry, you should by buying 2 books. I've given them as part of wedding gift to almost all of my friends that have any interest in wine. So much information through shops and publications like ""Wine Spectator"" designed to simply push product as opposed to really furthering you understanding your taste and preferences.  1) Windows of the World : This will provide a quality, brief introduction to the ""academic"" aspects of wine. It will tell you a little bit each of the major wine regions of the world, how its produced and regulated, and the aspects that goes in to creating a wine's taste. It will give you an idea of wines that typify a regions style, which I think is perfect starting point. The author, Kevin Zraley, writes in a conversational tone that makes it an easier read than those written in a reference format. There is also a tasting portion based on the course he used to teach. That could serve as a good point of reference for wines to try  2) What to Drink with What you Eat This contains a narrative portion that describes the factors that go in to wine pairing as well as a reference portion. Its great starting point to get an idea of the components of a wine's flavor and how it interacts with other food's taste.  At your age, I wouldn't invest to much in storage units, as there is a good chance you could be moving around a lot, and moving wine and its storage SUCKs. You should be spending you money on being able to taste new wines. The two biggest things are to be able to keep the wine on its side and up against the cork and to keep it at a reasonable temperature 55-65*F is considered ideal, but even room temperature is reasonable so long as you are only storing the wine for a short time.   EDIT: No need to spend too much on glasses. You can decently made glasses for $5-7 a piece. Homegoods is a good source if you live in the US. I know a lot of people new to wine are tempted to get a unique design to show off their interest, but noticing the color, clarity and rim variation on a wine is a big part of a wine's characteristic; it's best accomplished with a clear, traditional shape thats not so large that wash out the aromatics."

Maybe also the Johnson/Robinson World Atlas of Wine, which is better for geography but worse for info.   Otherwise find a specialist wine store in your area and ask them for recommendations in your price range within certain specifications. ""What's your best $20 California Zin/red Rioja/Alsatian Riesling"" etc etc. will usually get good results at a good store that trains its employees well.   You don't need storage gear if you are just buying five or six bottles at a time for drinking within the next few weeks/month. Buy a set of decent Bordeaux glasses (low-end Riedels or similar, about $10-15/glass), which work for pretty much anything. A $10 double hinge waiter's friend is all you need for an opener."

The majority of stores have the wine that, in most other states, appears in average supermarkets. ""Premium Collection"" stores have more off the beaten track wines at all price ranges. In particular, they have what they call ""Chairman's Selection"" wines, which I almost always have been pleased with. That's what I recommend to my PA friends. Even though ""Chairman's Selection"" sounds vaguely Maoist. :-)  There may be privately owned specialty stores out there but I do not know of any and am doubtful they exist. Perhaps there are some in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, but I live in Pennsyltucky so it's state stores, wineries, or nothing."

You can't just go in expecting the normal selection of supermarket wines,  but that's a mixed bag I guess.   Oh yeah and most (all?) of the private wineries are just there to push their own wines,  not a good place to shop to Learn. Some of the stores have Knowledgeable  employees, it can really depend. That's why a larger store is generally  preferred,  possibly  a more upscale one for a larger wine selection.  Also see if any near you have free wine tasting. Not all state store are the same.

wine,3brv0h,dontgetpenisy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:38:40 2015 UTC,Find a retail wine specialist and get to know them. They are in the premium collection stores. The bigger the store...the better the specialist.
wine,3brv0h,Muppet_Mower,3,Sat Jul 4 04:42:27 2015 UTC,"For starters, I wouldn't worry too much at this stage about perfect storage - I would aim to try and taste as mich variety as possible rather than purchasing cases for aging and cellaring. That should come further down the line once you have a grip on your own preferences and know what is best for keeping etc. (edit - not to say you shouldnt keep it at a stable, cool temperature but at this point you want to drink stuff not store stuff so cellar conditions aren't vital)  You should try and taste as much and as different stuff as possible. Varietals, regions, new world/old world etc. If you have the money and the time, courses such as the WSET are good for introducing you to wine and also learning a systematic approach to tasting. Use a systematic approach to keep track of what you have been tasting and you can start to build up an idea of how wine varies from region to region, grape to grape, method to method. Part of the fun (to me at least!) is the link to geography and places in the world.  Next you should find your nearest good quality wine shop and become a regular. Good shops often do tastings, as do good wine bars, for either free or quite reasonably priced, and the more of these you go to the more exposure you get to the variety of wine. Also there are many books to read - good intros are Jancis Robinson/Hugh Johnson's atlas (if you like big and expansive), Oz Clarke (if you like British pseudoiconoclastic laddishness) and more.  Last of all, have a bloody good time! Drinking wine is a beautiful combination of cerebral pleasure and hedonistic abandon and everyone should do it."

wine,3brv0h,Muppet_Mower,3,Wed Jul 1 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of good stuff being posted here, but here's my suggestion.    Buy some nice wine glasses. I default to a red wine style since I drink a lot of reds. They're still usable for whites, so don't worry about it. Find a good book that will start you off. If you are a wine novice and you'd like and easy read, check out Great Wine Made Simple by Andrea Immer Robinson. My fiance and I have been reading this one to improve our wine knowledge and expose us to some wines we wouldn't otherwise drink. My favorite thing about this book though is that Robinson, who is a Master Sommelier, encourages you to participate in numerous wine tastings in the book and she includes a list of various wines you should be able to find at most grocery/liquor stores. Also, you start by drinking the big 6 varietals, so you are better acquainted with their flavor profiles. Get your mom involved! It sounds like she may be into learning more about wine too! But seriously,  it's always fun to drink as a group. Everybody's palate is different, so it can be a lot of fun seeing what everyone smells and tastes. Optional: Smell and taste everything around you. The more you know what things smell like the more you can describe the wine you're drinking.  Optional: Google your city and ""wine school"" or ""wine classes"". If you live in a large city you may be able to find something.    Cheers!!"

So... drink lots of wine... in moderation of course, well mostly anyway (your sense of taste diminishes when you're drunk). There is no right or wrong, just your own taste so again, try to remember what you like and what wines go well with what, for you.

I do have a sort of inside man who I trust 100% to tell me which estates to go for, but many times I just can't be bothered asking him for favors and I'll keep to other areas or wines similar to Pinotage.

Especially off the mark on China's top end wines, which are not that expensive, $60-80 USD, and they hold their own and show much better than many priced international products at that price point.  You can find the EXACT same thing in bumf**k America.

The reason for these specific labels is marketing, they want to have appeal to a large national audience so edgy and cool looking labels are pretty much all they've got. I'm sure they've done their market research and it's currently commercially viable.  People sure as hell don't buy these for what's in the bottle, at least not at those prices."

Nowadays, it doesn't justify its price even when it's on the 5 cent sale at BevMo.  Wineries and labels have had to become quite creative to differentiate themselves. There are fads in that area.

wine,3brjlt,Muppet_Mower,2,Wed Jul 1 17:55:15 2015 UTC,"You have your work cut out for you; the wines are at the bottom of the drinks list, and the selection is perfunctory: a sparkler, a sauvignon blanc, a chardonnay, a pinot noir, a cabernet. Gee, all the bases covered! And all $7-9. And all but the prosecco domestic.   They could create many more profit opportunities for themselves by expanding their BTG program to include at least a few higher end items, but I bet they draw the line at charging more for a glass of wine than for their burger. So not much to do there. They could create even more profit opportunities by selling by the bottle, but even a killer sandwich shop is probably not the place that a party of two or three or four will linger over dinner and consume a bottle.   One last issue: Places that emphasize local ingredients can be really obtuse about wine. There isn't going to be any ""local"" wine in Birmingham, but I bet they favor domestic wines. What I've done in similar situations is brought in copies of the wine lists at some of the top U.S. restaurants that feature local ingredients. Guess what? Most of the wines on those lists are European!  Seriously, these guys started out with a food truck. They probably think the very idea of fine wine is a lot of pretentious baloney. I wish you the best of luck. You're going to need it."

I don't know what your portfolio is like, but try to offer them 'decent' and 'honest' wines that lack pretentiousness, and seem trendy. Perhaps something organic/bio-dynamic (Though that is pretentious in its own way). To be honest I think they won't care too much for whats actually inside the bottle, but rather the story behind it, as they too seem to focus on the story of their business in their marketing."

MVGV is significantly better than the straight NV, and my experience of the 2002 says you have another decade to wait until it really hits stride. Storage is key though, champagne is very sensitive and ideally it needs to be stored in a good cellar. If it's been sitting on your kitchen counter for the past 5 years, you might as well crack on."

I plan on taking WSET level two at the Johnson and Wales in North Miami Beach in September just to get a base in and continue studying and tasting.  There is a place called Wine Watch by me and in July they have a tasting featuring D-Lynn from Somm so I really want to go and try to get ten minutes of his time to pick his brain about the process.
wine,3bmyv8,Muppet_Mower,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"bro if you actually learned to study in college then WSET level 4 is easy, u just have to put in the hours of reading and making notecards etc.  for tasting go to wine tasting events, tastings at local wine shop, splitting costs with classmates (everyone bring a diff bottle, write notes, compare notes) and it doesn't cost that much either.  the entirety of WSET4 is about equal in difficulty to a first-year college science course like bio 101.  just like there's big units on cell bio, evolution, ecology, etc there's units on viticulture, industry, fortified, spirits, sparkling, light wines (""wine""), each unit is not terribly deep but requires a good deal of memorizing.  and just like a practical lab component of bio 101 there is a tasting portion.  again, not too deep as you don't even need to guess the wine right, you just need to write a detailed tasting note with all the necessary components with some time pressure.  and like in bio if you don't take time to study and just waltz into the final you're going to have a bad time, but with the typical amount of studying it's really not that hard.  i say bio and not chem/physics because it's just rote memorization recall on the test, no calculating / figuring out anything.  ultimately for many people the most difficult part of these certifications is finding the time to study, as most have full time jobs and many have families and other commitments that often get prioritized over studying, especially since the test always seems to be ""months away, I'll study tomorrow"".   i dont know about advanced somm, but i'd reckon the knowledge level is about the same as WSET4, but due to the added service component it's probably harder."

Pretty much all of them just said it's the same as the courts certified exam.   Make your note cards, find some tests, taste a bunch.   They recommended preparing for the next class up before you take the one you're on. IE. Taking the level 2, prepare for the level 3. Taking your certified, prepare for the advanced.

I got accepted surprisingly soon after my certified, usually it takes a few applications do get a seat but I was shortlisted the first time and accepted the second. I definitely should have studied more (or at least more effectively).  The difference between 2 and 3 is astronomical. All I can say is, immerse yourself in the reading list and taste taste taste. Also, learn the vintages for ALL major regions at least as far back as 30 years if not 40.  Learn producers and soil as well as winemaking. You absolutely cannot study too much for this exam.

wine,3bmyv8,Icepick1011,7,Tue Jun 30 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"Australian Riesling is a fairly easy blind wine to spot. The wines are militantly dry and generally have a lower pH than any other Riesling in the world, making them incredibly fierce. My signature for them is a Rose's lime juice quality on the palate and a very intense inorganic aroma on the nose, like a ""fresh can of tennis balls.""  It is also the only New World Riesling that has a high probability of showing up on the exam. Other New World Riesling has failed to show a typicity across producers to garner a ""classic"" style.  When you taste Australian Riesling you're really up against Austrian or German Trocken."

The aroma as well as taste of chemical rubber was overwhelming to the point I poured it down the drain. I had written off Aussie Riesling in my mind forever as undrinkable. I did however go to an all white tasting a week or so ago with Rieslings from Austria, Germany and Alsace with one Clare valley Riesling peppered in there. I avoided it assuming it would be just as overwhelming. After we were done with the tasting my wife asked me to grab her one more sip of something so being the coy little brat that I am I got her the Clare Valley as neither one of us had tasted it. I smelled it on the way over to her and after being surprised at the nose I took a sip. It had a background essence of the ""Petrol"" without it being overwhelming but I think in a blind tasting I would for sure be able to spot it as easily as a New Zealand Sauv."

I should mention that these are second hand comments from various winemakers I worked under , and not my own observations.  Clare valley is probably the best area for Australian Riesling (I tasted entry level Riesling back to 1984 that was fully developed drinking fantastically, and reserve level back to 1989 that was developed, but still had fruit).  Sub regions of polish hill is more lime zest, slate, tennis ball in youth.  Watervale is more floral.  Some people like clare valley Riesling young, I find they can be a little austere but drink amazingly with 7+ years on them.  Best producers imo are grosset, jim Barry, and pikes.  All produce exceptional wines, and pikes and jim Barry both produce great wines, even at inexpensive prices.  Barossa valley Riesling is rare, and pretty floral when you find it.  Eden valley is similar to Clare, probably a little more approachable young but lacking the ability to age that"

wine,3bmvg9,tkrens,3,Tue Jun 30 14:31:02 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to give a reliably accurate answer for Chassagne as a whole as it'll vary quite a lot wine to wine, are we talking village level or 1er cru? And what sort of calibre of producer?  In general terms, I would say entry level 2007 Chassagnes are a little tired now, while better examples are mature but would be drinking very nicely. If I had to make an (inevitably not always accurate) estimate of a 'general' drinking window for 07 Chassagne as a whole I'd have said something like 2010-2015, with some going a little longer.  A serious danger with maturing white Burgundies is premature oxidation, but actually 2007 is one of the less effected vintages on the whole, see http://oxidised-burgs.wikispaces.com/  but note that when they're discussing 2007s they're really talking about the Grand Crus."

wine,3bmvg9,claretyportman,2,Tue Jun 30 15:30:33 2015 UTC,"Oh wow it's a red! That's fairly unusual for Chassagne, it's probably about 80% white.  I'm not familiar with the producer so it's difficult to say with confidence, but personally I'd be quite enthusiastic about the idea of drinking 2007 red Chassagne but I'd be slightly wary about having a large quantity of it to sell. It's a lighter vintage than most others and given it's just a village wine my guess is that this while it would appeal to geeks, it wouldn't be for everyone. Probably a pretty light and mature wine, maybe getting a bit earthy now and losing fruit, but that's only speculation having not tasted it. I really enjoy relatively 'humble' 2007s at the moment as I love the sense of lightness, they taste more mature than they are.  All in all I'd say it could go either way but I'd definitely want to taste it before going long on it..."
wine,3bmvg9,sdeha,2,Tue Jun 30 16:06:10 2015 UTC,"Currently about 1/3 of wine produced in Chassagne-Montrachet is red, the number used to be much higher in the past. Based on some estimates as high as 80% of wine 70 years ago was red in the village. However, it is rather rare to see a red Chassagne-Montrachet nowadays outside France, people tend to associate CM with white wines only. Chassagne-Montrachet reds arent generally the lightest wines of burgundy, often showing very robust fruit and earthy characteristics. Naturally like in all things burgundy this is a gross simplification.   The wine definitely could be interesting, I have not tasted any red from 2007 Chassagne, but the few from Santenay which is somewhat similar in style have been from good to average.   But as always with Burgundy, buying without tasting is a gamble. The wine could be excellent, or it could be bad. We rarely take any Burgundy wines on our wine list without tasting them first, unless the wine is from an excellent producer and from an excellent vintage. I am not familiar with the producer, but quick google search seems to suggest that it is atleast above average quality. However the vintage is definitely not the best, and these wines are likely to be in the end of their prime, probably with slightly soft acidity already."
wine,3bmvg9,thewhits,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:19:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice /u/sdeha and /u/claretyportman ! I will see if I can get a taste before purchasing. Usually that wouldn't be an issue but its a very low quantity of bottles and I get the impression from the supplier he also thinks they may be at/over their prime. That said, the lower price may make up for it, as I can also give my customers a good deal."
wine,3bmvg9,sdeha,2,Wed Jul 1 09:24:45 2015 UTC,It really depends on the producer.
wine,3bmvg9,michaelcuz,2,Tue Jun 30 14:54:52 2015 UTC,"All in all vintage 2007 was a pretty mediocre for burgundy whites, definitely overshadowed by the spectacular 2005 and the excellent vintage of 2008. This naturally doesnt mean that there is no good wine made in 2007, just that on average they might not be the best examples of burgundy white. To even more complicate things, 2007 seems to currently drink very well with open fruitiness even though little lacking in acidity.   So to sum up, it is impossible to say if the wine you are offered is good based on just vintage. Some producers made excellent wine in 2007, wine that is now in good condition to drink. Some wine might take a couple of years to open fully, and some producers failed in 2007 completely."

What I dont get is the idea of stones in rocky soils radiating heat back at night so the grapes ""continue to ripen"".

wine,3bkm8s,jasonsnyc,3,Tue Jun 30 00:09:44 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone,  I've been a lurking for a little bit and very much enjoying the wine subreddit.   I thought it would be more fun to share and join in the conversation.   I have been drinking wine for a long time, but am not to really thinking about it.     Tasting Notes on this 2002 Raffault  Les Picasses: After first opening, the nose was STRONG with barnyard aromas that smelled like mostly like manure to the point that I couldn't pick out much else, other than that there was definitely some fruit underneath.  After an hour, the barnyard aromas faded and the nose showed leafy / vegetable aromas and along with fruit that reminds me of cherries.    Question:  Is the barnyard aroma a fault in the wine?   I nearly brought it back to the wine shop, but I am glad I didn't because I'm really enjoying it after it aired out.    I notice this barnyard smell in a lot of french wines and I mostly like it, which is weird because it does smell like sh!t."
wine,3bkm8s,andtheodor,2,Tue Jun 30 00:17:40 2015 UTC,"I find this wine too flawed for me to enjoy, but people really love it. It comes across as ashy and stale cigarettes, not really barny, but it reminds me of sitting in a smoker's car or something, almost sickening. Some vintages have a twist of old Bordeaux vibe that's interesting, but this is one of those wines that I swear I'm drinking something else entirely compared to what other people taste."
wine,3bkm8s,ewilliam,2,Tue Jun 30 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"As /u/stueycal mentioned, the barnyard funk is from Brettanomyces. It's not a bacteria, though, it's a particular form of ""wild"" yeast...and it's not universally considered a ""spoilage"" organism. Many wine styles benefit from a bit of Brett funk; Loire Cab Franc is definitely one of them (and perhaps the most prominent).   The problem (if you want to call it that) is that if wines aren't entirely stabilized in the bottle, the funk can take over.   I'm very familiar with Olga Raffault and the Les Picasses in particular. I still have some 06's and 07's (07 is the current release with our distributor). This wine is notoriously brett-ey and not necessarily stable in that regard. As such, I don't usually age them too far beyond the significant age that they already have upon release from the estate, because what can be a pleasant touch of brett funk (as in the case of the 06 and 07 currently) can overpower the wine as it ages. I'm fairly certain this estate is organic and biodynamic, so you should expect some of this kind of thing, but I also find that a good proportion of org/bio wines are a crapshoot in the cellar for this very reason. Hell, even among the 06's and 07's that I've been drinking, there's some bottle variation.   tl;dr Brett is common in Raffault's Cab Francs, and is typically pleasant when the wines are younger, but due to the continued metabolism by the Brett of certain enzymes in the wine while in bottle, the Brett ""funk"" can eventually overpower the other elements in the wine as it ages, and then it turns from ""feature"" into ""bug"", if you will."
wine,3bkm8s,ewilliam,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:29:35 2015 UTC,Certainly not tl;dr    Thanks for the information.  This was very helpful as I do like Raffault too and now I have a better of which vintages to choose
wine,3bkm8s,Socrates5150,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:51:18 2015 UTC,"No prob. I've worked a lot with Brett as a homebrewer, and it's a funny thing. You can use it as the primary fermenter, and it acts very much like your typical beer yeast, with a slight touch of funk. However, if you ferment with normal beer yeast first, then add Brett afterwards, then you get the intense funk. Turns out it's because the funk, as I mentioned above, comes from Brett metabolizing certain enzymes, and those enzymes are actually by-products of the primary fermentation using Saccharomyces Cerevisae. Weird stuff, but fun to play with.   Anyway, glad you dig Loire Franc, it's my fav."
wine,3bkm8s,stueycal,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:28:17 2015 UTC,"I get more brett notes from Bernard Baudry Chinon. Having had the 85, 87, 92, 02, 05, 07, &  10 of this wine I have never got overwhelming brett. A touch, sure, but never overwhelming. And I have a pretty low tolerance for brett."
wine,3bkm8s,ClotheTheTart,0,Tue Jun 30 22:47:22 2015 UTC,The barnyard can be a little bit of Brett which is a spoilage bacteria that can get into wine in certain situations. French wines from regions like chinon make wines in more of an old world style and it's quite possible the wine maker feels like it is adding a complex element to the wine.
wine,3bkm8s,kevin_k,2,Tue Jun 30 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"Some of the Raffault Les Picasses that I have had have been very bretty. Oxygen encourages brettanomyces growth so, over time, the brett will increase from the oxygen transfer through the cork while the primary fruit characteristics are decreasing. It has been my experience that while a hint of brett may be charming and ""rustic"" when the wine is released, bottle age may make it overpowering."
wine,3bkm8s,piracer,2,Tue Jun 30 06:41:07 2015 UTC,"For me, the barnyard (Brett) comes in two varieties with French wine.  Some smell like rotten / gamey meat and others like manure.   I like the rotten meat smell much more, especially when I drink it with gamy meat like lamb.  I don't know if I'd be this vintage again.  I have had the 2001, 2007, and 2008 by the same make and so far I think the 2007 was my favorite.    The Brett really did seem to disappear after about an hour of the bottle being opened.   Is it that I just got used to it or is that something that's expected to happen?"

wine,3blttx,absolute_banger,3,Tue Jun 30 22:52:54 2015 UTC,Grillet is an enclave geographically inside the condrieu appellation but is technically a separate appellation with different laws. Grillet actually has a different terroir to the rest of condrieu as well.  Grillet is generally more expensive than condrieu. Whether it's better is down to personal taste. Grillet uses long new oak aging and its wine can age about 10 years. Condrieu is more fresh and is better when consumed young.

wine,3bi85b,flitcroft,0,Mon Jun 29 19:42:53 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. The nature of a good gift is the thought. The way I've approached the same scenario is to seek out something unique that the hosts may want. Knowing about your gift recipient is a must, as always, so assuming you know something about their tastes go to a top tier locally owned wine store and talk to the staff for a while. Perhaps there's a regional bottle that is halfway decent or a wine that OP has enjoyed him/herself. Story goes a long way toward sharing a memory and creating a new moment.  That said, there are great spirits out there too. I'd apply the same logic but wouldn't shy away from wine even to someone with a 10,000 bottle cellar. Generally that's a sign the person REALLY likes wine!"
wine,3bi85b,OMGBADBEATZLOL,2,Mon Jun 29 19:55:28 2015 UTC,"That's fine, but you need to know more than just ""gift for wine dork, have a Benjamin"".. just imo"

wine,3bi85b,kafkian,3,Mon Jun 29 16:12:46 2015 UTC,Why not twist the Champagne advice a little and buy a good Franciacorta like Bellavista or Ca del Bosco which should be widely available everywhere but a little off of the beaten Champagne path. If you go for spirits maybe a nice grappa such as something from Nonino should do it.
wine,3bi85b,winemule,4,Mon Jun 29 22:29:42 2015 UTC,"Not everyone loves Veuve! Ask your wine merchant for a Champagne made by the people who grew the grapes (yes, in most places the people who grow the grapes make the wine, but Champagne is different). There are several ways to ask:  1. I'd like to see a Récoltant-Manipulant Champagne, please. 2. I'd like to see a Grower Champagne, please. 3. Dude, got any farmer fizz?

It's a special occasion and a good reason to go fancy, without having to break the bank. Have you heard of Moët Ice Impérial?

wine,3bi85b,skippgil,3,Mon Jun 29 16:09:09 2015 UTC,"I took a peeksie at your profile and came to the conclusion that you live in the Boston area. The Boston Winery offers wine making classes, which could be a good gift if that is something they might be into. Otherwise, I would second u/half_glass and get a few bottles for a tasting experience. If you're hell bent on buying a fancy bottle, first find out what type of wine they prefer and then go to a shop or winery to buy. Often times, at least in Washington, the wineries are more expensive than a typical wine/beer shop, but you'll get better advice and direction from a winery most of the time."
wine,3bi85b,zodar,3,Mon Jun 29 15:21:08 2015 UTC,"Haha nice ""detective"" work. I wouldn't say I'm hell bent on buying an expensive bottle I, more or less, just want to do the right thing because they are literally providing everything this weekend. As I said, we don't know much about wine but wanted to express our gratitude as best as possible, but also don't want to make fools out of ourselves by spending an exorbitant amount of money only to find out we gave them something they don't like. I'm trying to see if my SO remembers what they like. I appreciate the reply!"
wine,3bi85b,skippgil,2,Mon Jun 29 16:05:40 2015 UTC,"I think you have two options... Buy something that is locally produced so it is more personal or purchase a nice bottle of something other than wine -- perhaps a bourbon, scotch, tequila etc.   If you'd like a recommendation, I recently tasted Two James' Grass Widow Bourbon, and I really enjoyed it. If you want more classic, then a nice, sippable bottle of whiskey they could nurse for a while. Something like laphroaig 18, lagavulin 16, Yamazaki 12 . I personally think it is better to avoid the ""name-brand"" and oft overpriced scotch that is usually bought as a gift (macallans, johnnie, balvenie etc).  If they have a cellar and are very into wine, chances are they are very particular and have no issues spending a decent sum on a quality case. If they know you aren't into wine, it would be a little weird bringing a bottle unless it was from around your hometown and had special meaning to it.  Have fun on vacation!"

wine,3bi85b,smallerthanhiphop,2,Tue Jun 30 10:03:39 2015 UTC,Is there a type of wine that you and your SO have particularly enjoyed? Typically - people who are in to wine are into trying new or different wines. For instance - I dislike 90% of cabs (hold your fire commenters) but I'm always interested in trying a new one!   Another idea I thought of is perhaps getting them a kickass white wine. It's summer! They don't need a big bossy red. Ridge Chardonnay is extremely an extremely well structured wine for around $60. Go to a local wine shop and give them your price range and tell them you want something for a gift that will complement the season well - a nice summery wine! Bandol Rosé wine is awesome.   These people will be flattered with whatever you get them.
wine,3bi85b,jmhemming,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:57:57 2015 UTC,"My SO and I typically enjoy white wines. But there isn't one I would say is our favorite because we've never been ""blown away"" to get a name.

wine,3bi85b,budissy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:59:18 2015 UTC,Oh give the Ridge a taste if even just for yourself. It's probably not one you'd pick in a restaurant (it'd be MUCH more than the $60 while dining out) and they do a wonderful chardonnay.

First, the question: what do you usually spend on a bottle? You will generally see a big jump from $7 to $14 to $21, and then less of a jump as prices go up from there.  Second:an idea... think about buying two bottles of the wine, hiding one, and serving it to your wife over a steak dinner a few weeks after you get back.

If it had a worm (metal wire spiral) it would not be shit.  Augers destroy the corks but they're cheaper to make as they can be cast. Worms must be formed from drawn metal wire and heat treated but they don't displace and tear up the cork anywhere near as much.

The list was broken down by region and is still my most favorite list I've worked with.  Anyway, Before I started working there, my italian wine knowledge was ""Uhh, Chianti comes wrapped in straw, right?"" My best study tool was the book Vino Italiano by Bastianich and Lynch (You can get it on Amazon for less than 20 bucks) Easy read to get the base idea of each region and what they produce mostly.  Our wine director during training said for us to learn regions, then varietals then producers. Regions: Huge, lotsa stuff going on. Varietals: More focused, why does Sangiovese grow best here and Nebbiolo better there? Producers: Thats great if you can tell me about Sassicaia or Ornellaia; but how about this Bibi Graetz Soffocone di Vincigliata or the Nino Negri Sfursat Cinque Stelle?   Italy is the toughest growing region out there. They have 100 names for the same grape in some places.   As for tasting, focus on your btg placements first. Get those down, then see if they can get some sample bottles of the more lower to mid range items for you to try/training. Outside of that, google tasting notes from places you trust. Once you get a feel for the region; you'll start to see the pattern.  Also, Pronunciation of everything is important. Italian is a kooky language.   http://balenachicago.com/bcwp/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Balena-Winelist-03.6.15.pdf  Heres the wine list I worked with. Its changed a bit, but the layout is fantastic and theres some easy educational things in the first couple pages that were really helpful.   Best of luck!"

Balena's list is great, def check it out (I worked there too..hello).  It's incredibly comprehensive, especially when you're trying to learn the different regions and more obscure grapes.  The rosetta stone at the beginning is super helpful. As I'm sure you know, being able to help a person who is unfamiliar with Italian wine by comparing more common new world varietals is one of the best tricks.  And as annoying as i find the three descriptors below each wine, they actually do give you a reasonable idea about what it might taste like.  I just started working at Spiaggia -- it's another big italian + champagne list that sounds more like what you might be getting into.  We've got a bunch of Barolo, Brunello, Amarone, etc, and that's the bulk of what most people are buying.  Learning producer styles and vintages has been key. Get familiar with the big names-- pore over Spiaggia, Del Posto, French Laundry, EMP, and any comprehensive wine list you can think of.  You should be very familiar with the wines you see across all the big lists.  Also, learning varietals/blends (Supertuscan, Friulian wines, etc.) will be big too.  People love it when you can point out a wine that has Cabernet in it (cringe).  Vino Italiano is great, but a little outdated at this point.

wine,3bdw4d,Sazerac1850,3,Tue Jun 30 02:52:34 2015 UTC,"I'd simply start with broad knowledge and work from there to narrower. The major styles and regions first so you aren't making huge gaffes, the history a bit and how it relates to 'modern' Italian production, the big name producers and so on. Memorize some basic vintage charts so you can talk up the differences between offerings in a general manner. Most casual wine consumers with a bit of knowledge will focus here more than they should likely but it can be a perception issue.  From there, find out what has sold well in the past and try to get to taste some of them. You want to get a small stable of ""go to"" wines. Read up tasting notes from respectable sources on a few wines. You won't start out knowing them all, nor should you. There's nothing wrong with saying ""I haven't tasted this one but it is in this style and Michelle (the Somm) swears that it is the richest ages Amarone he's tried in years!"" It is fine to not know everything about every wine when it's not your list. As well, talk to your chef and see if there is input to be had there. There may or may not be but it's nice to involve that end of things whenever possible.  Besides, let's be perfectly honest here. Guests that are drinking Italian often have a pretty good idea what they want anyhow. They will likely have in mind a region and a price and only be looking to you to clarify some unknown (to them) bottles or to help narrow selections. If you can say that of these here, you recently tasted A and B and were impressed by this in B then you are likely good to go. This isn't a Court grilling you are in for, it's just service and making people happy."

Or even examples you don't sell. Just make sure the producer is decently reviewed.  In some DOC/G there are multiple styles of the wines being made like in Barolo where there are old-school super tannic wines and new-school more approachable, oakier wines, then you might want to seek out an example of each type.  EDIT: Also, try to get introduced to your rep(s) and they might be able to hook you up with opportunity to try some of their portfolio.

wine,3bc4iw,HornetAttack,5,Sat Jun 27 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"quick notes  89 montrose: Too tannic on the palate. Green Pepper was way too aggressive. Needs a lot of time to be palatable.   85 Ampeau Combettes: Butterscotch and umami on the nose. Juicy caramel apple on the palate. Looking down from its peak but still enjoyable  96 DRC La Tache: A flawed bottle. Very very tired. No power, barely any fruit, lots of stewed earthy flavors.   02 DRC 1er DB- awesome 02 DRC. One of the best 02 reds I've had in awhile. Incredibly forward and full and big time power  93 Pichon La: Basic on the palate, a bit thin. Peppery on the nose  86 Heitz Martha: Copious amounts of fresh mint on the nose. Deep dark fruit on the palate, a bit thin on the finish, but an EXCELLENT wine for the vintage.   76 nicolas CSD: On its last legs. Soft, clean wine but not really giving up much.   76 Bonneau de Matray Corton: Big burly tannic wine. Surprised how structured and dense it was considering the age. Still has fruit but at some point the tannin needs to integrate or it'll completely outlast the fruit.   89 Domaine Drouhin Oregon: Flowers, five spice, light soy sauce on the nose. Long clean acid on the palate with cooling bright fruit. Delicious wine.  45 Faiveley Corton Clos des Corton: Meaty, dark fruited on the nose. Clean and pure on the palate with fully integrated acidity. Earthy tones of dark fruit. I guessed early 70's cdb and was off by 30 years. Incredible wine for the age."

wine,3bc4iw,Muppet_Mower,3,Sun Jun 28 20:06:45 2015 UTC,"Last night I went to the Spectrum wine auction (in Los Angeles) with several friends from my wine crew. Each of us brought bottles to pop and, as usual, Spectrum opened a number of exciting wines that they poured throughout the night. For an auction, it was really about as wild and rowdy as it gets. There were a lot of wines there, but the ones below are the ones that stood out/for which I took notes.   1989 Chateau Montrose - A gentleman from a table over poured this for us and we shared our wines as well. Very good, strong fruit but mild tannins. Maybe a hint of green pepper (though my more Burg-oriented friends thought it had way too much green pepper for their palates). I liked this a lot and found it way more open than the last time I had this a couple years ago.   1985 Robert Ampeau & Fils Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Combettes - Wow, this wine looked incredibly fresh in the glass for its age! Awesome nose with all sorts of umami and mushroom scents. Fresh on the palate too. Very nice white Burg.   1996 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti La Tâche - Some flowers (roses?) and spice on the nose, with sweet but soft red fruit on the palate. Fred compared this to an aged Dujac Combettes.   2002 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Cuvée Duvault-Blochet - I didn’t take any notes on this but I think I liked it more than the La Tache.   1993 Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande - From a 6L. Dark fruit, some peppery and savory notes too.  1986 Heitz Cellar Cabernet Sauvignon Martha's Vineyard - Classis Heitz Martha’s with mint and eucalyptus aromas and a nice dark-fruited palate. Yum.  1976 Nicolas Clos St. Denis - Aged soft fruit nose that was initially quite lovely, but after a couple minuets in the glass it started to take on a metallic taste and smell, kind of like coins.  1989 Domaine Drouhin Oregon Pinot Noir - A very cool wine to try. It was floral on the nose with a spice and cherry palate.   1945 Faiveley Corton Clos des Cortons - Crazy tasting wine. Sadly I didn’t write down notes for this, and it was towards the end of the night, but I remember it being meaty and wild.   1999 Domaine du Clos de Tart Clos de Tart - Awesome nose of meat, red fruit and all sorts of umami complexity. Somewhat thin on the palate but still really nice. I do think that I liked this more than my friends did.   1993 Domaine Tempier Bandol Cuvée Spéciale La Tourtine - Really pretty floral and red fruit nose but kind of meh on the palate.   1982 Chateau Musar Blanc - An interesting and hard to describe wine. There were some savory notes on the nose and palate and it was a bit funky, but not in a bad way. My friends did not like it, but I thought it was pretty neat.   2008 Domaine Roulot Meursault Les Meix Chavaux - Roulot is so ridiculously pure. This was like drinking crystalline water – that tastes like wine – from a clear mountain spring. To be honest, it was a bit too pure for me at first, but it opened up later in the night to some buttery tropical and yellow fruit.  2008 Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrières - Once this opened up it was fantastic. Really fat yellow fruit and perfect oak integration at the end of the night.   2012 Henri Boillot Meursault 1er Cru Les Genevrières - Nice orchard fruit and good depth.   1980 Mount Eden Vineyards Pinot Noir - Chinese medicinal herbs and coffee. Super spicy nose."

wine,3bd25j,drew_fire,6,Sun Jun 28 01:52:58 2015 UTC,Background: Blah blah blah girl blah blah blah life blah blah no real problems to speak of  So I've turned to wine. 1999 Clos du Val Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon. Found at a joint in my hood that I've had mixed results in...but so far so good.  The color is an extremely deep garnet. Viscosity is medium to medium plus. On the nose- an ash tray. Wait a second. No. Ugh. Dude sitting next to me at the bar is a smoker.  Okay he's gone. Lots of oak. Tobacco (normal wine tobacco). Light fruit. Lower alcohol. 13.5%. Immediately on the palate I notice the oak the tobacco. Minimal fruit. Medium minus tannins. The finish is pretty short. Complexity is medium minus. It's drinking pretty well but I'd say the wine has passed its peak. I can't tell how long ago though. The structure is noticeably weak.  It might not sound like a great write up but the wine is pretty enjoyable. 120 price point. 10 dollar corkage. There's an art show here so that's kind of cool I guess. If you like girls with blue hair and people who listen to music that I've never heard of. I guess I'm just old. Paired with prosciutto wrapped dates with blue cheese. Outcome: eh.  Cheers.

wine,3bc0xk,winemule,3,Sun Jun 28 10:20:40 2015 UTC,"I recall being called ""an irresponsible hedonist"" in these precincts a year or two back, because I felt then--as I do today--that the first duty of wine is to be delicious. Nicolas Joly's ""the wine must first be true"" was an interesting vote for the primacy of terroir but as an actual winemaking philosophy--let's just say it's a money-loser and leave it at that.  The mention of Jenny & Francois is appropriate. Ten years ago, I tasted through part of their portfolio, and it was like a museum of wine faults: Reduction, volatile acidity, brettanomyces, refermentation...ten years later, I've retasted some of these wines, and the quality has improved hugely. Which leads me to infer that making wine via minimal intervention is not for amateurs."

Same with the folks over at the Pursuit of Balance.  ""Parker and is 100 point score are ruining Californian wine!!!!""  Oh yea?  Didn't he give your anti-Parker wine a 97? Hmm...  In my humble opinion,  there is nothing special about low-alcohol wines.  They are everywhere.  They aren't a rare commodity.  Go to the store and pick out ten of the cheapest bottles on the rack.  They will all be 13.5 or less.  Lower alcohol means that you are paying less taxes and therefore your margins are improving.  There is nothing supernatural about it."
wine,3bc0xk,Indesertum,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:39:14 2015 UTC,"i am more of a moderate on the issue but 13.5% ABV isn't particularly low or representative of Pursuit of Balance. Obviously a lot of the cheapest wines at a supermarket will probably be 13.5% or less because most wines are 13.5% or less.  Also you're completely wrong that the 10 cheapest wines are all 13.5% ABV or less. The Trader Joe and Yellowtail reds for example regularly go into 14, 14.5% ABV  This is a dumb argument to begin with. The cheapest wines having low ABV has little to do with why many people prefer low ABV wines. Nobody is saying they're a rare commodity. Nobody is talking about the quality of cheap supermarket wines when talking about natural vs parkerized wines. Great strawmans all around. I mean just the fact that you think 13.5% ABV wines need to be bashed because in your opinion they're low says a lot about you"
wine,3bc0xk,HelenHuntsAss,0,Tue Jun 30 05:29:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe to put us on the same page I'll say this:   Every month I read a new article that demonizes Parker,  every month I read an article that says Californian wines aren't nuanced and are too alcoholic.  My circle of Moustachiod Hipster Somm friends regurgitate the same buzzwords and they make my head spin back to 2004.   I'm right there with you.  I don't care what the alcohol of a wine is and don't think it is nearly as important as our Hipster Somm friends make it out to be.  I've had high alcohol wines that were balanced and nuanced and low alcohol wines that were unbalanced and not so nuanced.    To your yellow tail point,  that might absolutely kill my point of cheaper wines tending to have lower alcohol or it might not pertain at all to my point as I was speaking about Californian wines.  I don't know a thing about Australian wine laws or if our trade relationship with Australia is favorable or unfavorable to the market here in the states. I'm still trying to figure out how to ship wine to Utah.  Certainly true to the label,  Yellow Tail is actually smuggled into the country on the backs of kangaroos. And I know what you're thinking;  I'm no idiot, I know kangaroos can't swim-  they obviously float over on Tony Abbott's empty head- plus kangaroos are perfect,  their marsupial pouches keep the wine at a steady 57 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius)   I'm also not bashing low alcohol wines, I don't have anything against low alcohol wines,  I've got all of their albums.  I think what happened is I took one paragraph that I read in the article and rambled.  But then again,  I'm a drunk,  and that's what drunks do.  Now you're arguing with a drunk,  and you know what the say about arguing with drunks,  right?  Listen to your father."

wine,3bc0xk,HelenHuntsAss,0,Mon Jun 29 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"To my point about alcohol content,  we have groups like ""in pursuit of balance"" who have been marketing their superior lower alcohol wines,  simultaneously bashing Parker and going as far to say that HE is what is wrong with Californian wine (as if there is something wrong with Californian wine!)- you know,  using broad brush statements like “everyone is making high octane,  punch you in the mouth wines to appease the Parker God! "" so I guess I say sarcastically that low alcohol Californian wines are literally a dime a dozen because most of the cheap shit you can get at your supermarket is below 13% as margins in the volume market are slimmer.  And you're right about Parker being antagonist towards ""natural wine"" but in my opinion they make themselves easy targets because they are the ones claiming year after year they reinvented the wheel and are ""reclaiming the true methods that have been long lost"" - whatever that means.  I have a few friends that dabble in natural wine making-  as i guess many of us have in our earlier years when we didn't have the resources for oak,  yeast,  nutrients,  ect and would just take free shit some grower gave us out of pity and fermented it in a tarp lined truck bed- I often joke that the ""real money""  in the natural wine market is making and selling ""natural,  biodynamic grape concentrate"" to the natural wine makers of the West.

I would recommend trying Nalle,  Lambert Bridge,  Limerick Lane,  and  Carlisle (If you can get it) among others.  Zinfandel to me is one of the most compelling varietals to try here in California because of how much it changes stylistically."

I work at a winery in VA, and we sell a partner VA winemaker's sparkling that I'm 95% sure says that. Didn't Dom Perignon create the bottle, not the Champagne?   Yeah, this visual, shareable content that's getting churned out isn't really doing any beginners favors if the facts are questionable."

wine,3b9rq2,LeepaTime,2,Sat Jun 27 03:41:26 2015 UTC,"Preface: this was my first short trip to the Finger Lakes. I manage a Fine wine store in a mid-Atlantic city that carries a few well known FLX wineries (mostly white).  Knowing and experiencing the region’s reputation for its whites, i wanted to explore the reds.  That being said, i went with my girlfriend and didn't want to spend the entire trip dragging her from vineyard to vineyard. There are probably dozens of amazing wineries in the FLX region I did not get the opportunity to visit or sample.   i have a few more complex notes for bottles i purchases or received larger samples while some notes are brief impressions i gathered from the on site vineyard tastings.   i'll start with the note i posted yesterday in another thread  Ravines 2013 Cabernet Franc: Young and a bit severe at this stage, but enjoyable.  Medium body, not as lean as other FLX Cab Francs. big dose of cranberry preserves upfront with tar, acidic tobacco, and black pepper. leafy black cherry and blackberry. pine, menthol, and some added richness from the classic french oak aromas. lots of tang, pepper, and spice throughout.  hot, acidic, and tannic on opening. i can appreciate a young cabernet franc but this still needs time. the fruit is not too green or underripe but rather the tannin overpowered the ripe red and black fruit without a lot of air.  Ravines is a great winery and this is a well made wine, just give it time.  i have a bottle of Ravines 2012 Pinot Noir i've yet to open. the sample i received at the winery was small but it ranked high on the finger lakes pinot noirs i sampled at this price point.   next, the Ravines 2014 Pinot Noir Rose i enjoyed the small sample so much i purchased a bottle.  great acid upfront, sharp but refreshing.  despite the pale color and brief skin contact, this had some of the richest and ripest red fruit of FLX roses i tasted. think watermelon candy, ripe strawberry, and a hint of tart cherry. big thumbs up.   overall Ravines Experience Very Positive. polite and knowledgable staff, fair prices, albeit small pours. one of the more stylish tasting rooms i visited.   Herman Wiemer 2013 Cabernet Franc super green and youthful at this stage but one i need to return to. bright cherry, bell pepper, almost effervescent acidity. screams summertime. i tasted from a fresh bottle and i imagine it vastly improved with air. that being said i love the brightness and slightly underripe character. earns the ~$20 price point.   2012 Wiemer Magdalena Cabernet Franc surprise sample from the incredibly friendly and helpful older lady pouring at Wiemer. tasted alongside the 2013 entry level, this has a fuller body, much more refined texture, and rich oak presence. much more dense black fruit. riper, but still seemingly old world. little pyrazine. quite good, but a hard sell at $40.   Overall Wiemer Experience: extremely positive. free samples, friendly staff, beautiful tasting room, and non-pretentious atmosphere for one of the region's most well known vineyards.   2012 Heart and Hands Pinot Noir 150ml pour from a new bottle at MicroClimate Wine Bar in Geneva.   medium body, ripe mouth coating texture with sweet tannins but a dry juicy finish.  Pomegranate, cherry preserve, red apple skin. Clove orange peel, present but silky French oak. Touch of acidic tobacco.   One of the best Finger Lakes Pinots i was able to taste. ripe and fruit driven but with a balanced and fun structure.  Red Tail Ridge Sparkling Teroldego 2011 150ml pour at Microclimate Fine bubbles, full body, youthful acid with tremendous ripeness.  Black currant preserves, cassis, ripe blackberry, rhubarb, charcoal minerality, pine sap. Decadent but dry. Nice oak presence but very well integrated. must try.  overall Microclimate Wine Bar Experience extremely positive. the owner and bar tender Stephanie(?) is a total wine geek and knows how to do a wine bar right.  hand picked quality wines, reasonable prices, healthy pours, and a great ambiance. she was passionate and personable without being pretentious. i've been to wine bars all over the east coast and found most of them overpriced, snobby, and with staff who don't understand the importance of freshness and pouring etiquette. Microclimate is one of the best wine bars i have ever been to.   Red Tail Ridge 2012 Pinot Noir solid expression of the grape. enjoyable, competative price wise, but didn't standout much beyond that from the small pour i had.   Red Tail Ridge 2012 Blaufrankisch  one of the most interesting reds i had during my stay. big wild red fruit with an old world tobacco acidity. loads of spice, pepper, and tang, without any harsh tannin or structural defect. wish i bought a bottle of this.   Overall Red Tail Ridge Experience: neutral. the wines were great, but the staff was unorganized, and frantic despite only a half a dozen patrons tasting, and i found the older lady pouring to be distracted and at times condescending. After trying to talk with each pourer and learn about the winery, i politely explained that i work for a wine store in their distrubution area, and asked if they offer an industry discount. Red Tail was the only vineyard not to give me any sort of discount. that being said, the tastings were cheap so i can't complain. RTRs wine is impressive and i will politely conclude my experience was the exception, not the rule.  2012 Damiani Cabernet Franc drinking the bottle i purchased as i write and compile these notes.  well done new world CF. shows the 2012 vintage well.   medium body, obvious oak presence, and juicy ripe red fruit.  fresh picked raspberry on the nose, with supporting cherry and a hint of tart cranberry. whiff of cedar.  while the 20% new American oak adds some sweetness and texture to the palate, there must be some french oak in here given the big dose of black chocolate, coffee, and charcoal.   medium body but packed with ripe fruit and sweet gentle tannins with just enough acidity. black pepper and graphite minerality show cabernet franc's trademarks but this is a super approachable and fun representation of the style.  not far off the reserve and single vineyard finger lakes cab francs that command twice the price. Drink now.  2012 Damiani Cab Franc Barrell Select tasted alongside entry level CF at tasting room. this showed denser fruit, more rich and refined oak, and overall complexity, without feeling overdone. CF's characteristic spicy aromas were on display while the hot 2012 vintage made for succulent ripe fruit. this reminded me the most of Wiemer's 2012 Magdalena, but i recall thinking this had the slight edge at a similar price point. one of the standouts of my trip.   2013(i think) Damiani Syrah  one of the rare syrah's being produced in the fingerlakes. more in line with cooler washington state syrahs than a thick boozy shiraz.   somewhat lean medium body, very expressive tangy red and blue fruit with hints of cured meat, smoke, and menthol. very young and acidic at this point but i bet this turns into something special. fun to try.   2013 Damiani MC2 (Merlot/CF/CS Blend) definitely young but well priced for the region. big cherry and plum, gentle tannins, but obvious baby fruit. reminded me of a 2013 california meritage or claret at the same price point. glad i tried but didn't wow me.   2011 Damiani Meritage Estate from what i understand, 2011 was a sucky year for FLX reds. considering that, this was a well made bordeaux blend. good balance of old and new world. Cabernet Sauvignon dominant shows itself on the palate with big brambly blackberry, graphite, and ashy minerality. the generous french oak helps soften some underripe fruit and add some richness. this actually reminded me of some 2011 reds from napa, where the vintage was also cool and difficult. all things considered Damiani managed to pull out a solid blend even if the price point has alot of competition (~$26)  overall Damiani Experience extemely positive. vineyard has a fantastic view from the east side of seneca lake. the young lady that poured for me and my girlfriend was charming, interested, and knowledgeable despite being new to the vineyard. big thumbs up.   Bottom Line The Finger Lakes are producing some world class reds. look for 2010, '12, and some '13 vintages. Pinot Noir and Cabernet Franc seem to be the go to grapes while Lemberger(Blaufrankisch) has solidified itself as extremely suitable for the region. i'm curious to try more syrah from the region(microclimate was out of Elements Syrah) and i've heard whispers that Zweigelt is on the radar for some talented Finger Lakes Growers.   OK that's all for tonight. i'll add more notes from memory or bottles in the cellar when i get the chance!"

Fulkerson (on the West side of Seneca) does, too, but I've had bad experiences there in the past.  It seems like you had a good trip! I found myself nodding along with your tasting notes -- though I've yet to try much of the '13 Cab Franc yet. The last time I went around most were still pouring the 2012s."

wine,3b9rq2,Indesertum,0,Sat Jun 27 04:26:10 2015 UTC,"the reds are decent to mediocre and mostly mediocre. the cab francs tend to have intense pyrazines that i'm not a fan of. IMO the bordeaux and rhone varietals are the worst and the PN and blaufrankisch are the most acceptable. i feel like especially the bordeaux varietals struggle to fully ripen. There's so many forgettable to mediocre wineries in the area.  heart and hands (maybe Ravines) PN is the only FL PNs I'd be happy to buy and only in some vintages. Ravines is possibly my favorite in the region  it's a beautiful area tho. Next time stop by Dano's Heuriger. Really friendly chef/owner, food is great rustic Austrian fare, and the view is fantastic. IMO best restaurant in the area is in Trumansburg and worth a stop by."

wine,3b7chc,GahMatar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:50:15 2015 UTC,"Curious, why not just use a contract bottler? 115 bottles/hour seems like a pretty slow way to go.

wine,3b7chc,peterpanwashere,2,Fri Jun 26 20:10:10 2015 UTC,"I was bottling 2 barrels, which is <600 bottles.  No contract bottler would even bother to take that contract. My total production for 2014 was 6 barrels, and I made 4 different wines, which will be bottled at 3 or 4 different times depending on when they're ready.  So, the economics of scale aren't there to pay for a contract bottler.  I may be able to tag onto the bottling run of the larger winery I'm renting space from at a future bottling, but the Albariño was ready to be bottled now."

wine,3b7chc,camwheeler,4,Sat Jun 27 18:47:49 2015 UTC,"I am in Canada for a few weeks so have had a bit of time to get to a few Niagara wineries - have been impressed with a number of the Riesling and Cabernet Franc based wines (some good Chardonnay around as well but a bit more inconsistent). Some of the better wines I've tried have been from Tawse, Hidden Bench, Thirty Bench, Cave Springs and Vineland. I will post my notes on Cellartracker at some point when I get home.  Seems to be a lot of improvement from some of the previous wines I've tried from here, I guess a combination of older vines, more experienced winemakers, better sites being located and so on.  The industry seems to be booming, there are now around 50 wineries on the Niagara Escarpment and another 40 around Niagara on the Lake. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.  Have had a few issues though - if there was ever a good advertisement for screwcap it'd be the number of slightly corked wines I've hit going around tasting (and the indifferent responses some of the staff have given was of further concern - a number of them weren't removed from tasting, with the staff not even rechecking them). Scary to lug some of these bottles back to Australia when TCA is obviously an issue.  Also the tasting fees are not well publicized on many wineries websites, so you are going in blind to a lot of them and some of the fee structures are totally overcomplicated. That said, most wineries are very generous once they realize you are not just there to get drunk - I think only one place has actually stuck to their published fees for me, with others waiving it or happily pouring as many wines as I wanted to try for the base fee."

Here is an example of a wine cooler that was successful for me.  I actually purchased this model to replace one from Edgestar which wasn't cooling bottles fast enough for us.  Think about it like this:  If you are expecting it to be a high volume operation and you are expecting the cooler to cool the wines down quickly (vs just hold them at the temp they enter the cooler) then I would suggest something with bigger fans, and a better coil system.    If you anticipate this cooler just holding for a few bottle services per night you should have no problem with the Edgestar."

Cab Franc and Pinot Noir are arguably the signature grapes of the region though i was pleasantly surprised by some lemberger, syrah, and dornfelder.   in a few days i will do a longer post with my best notes of the best reds i was able to sample and purchase including wines from Wiemer, Red Tail Ridge, Ravines, Damiani, Heart and Hands among others. be on the lookout!  NOTES: young and a bit severe at this stage, but enjoyable.  medium body, not as lean as other FLX Cab Francs. big dose of cranberry preserves upfront with tar, acidic tobacco, and black pepper. leafy black cherry and blackberry. pine, menthol, and some added richness from the classic french oak aromas. lots of tang, pepper, and spice throughout.  hot, acidic, and tannic on opening. i can appreciate a young cabernet franc but this still needs time. the fruit is not too green or underripe but rather the tannin overpowered the ripe red and black fruit without a lot of air.  Ravines is a great winery and this is a well made wine, just give it time."
wine,3b5j27,scag315,2,Fri Jun 26 03:39:25 2015 UTC,I grew up in the area. I can't recommend Lucas enough. Their Semi-dry Reisling is great. Also Dr. Franks is always great. Wagner is fun especially if you like beer as well. Thirsty Owl is nice place to have lunch. I'm not crazy high on their wines but their food is good and you can buy a bottle at cost with your lunch. If you want to try something different Montezuma has spirits made from honey. Goose watch is a nice spot to stop as well.   I hope you're enjoying your time in the region.

Goose Watch you go to more for the nice view and nice place to have a bottle. Thirsty Owl's cafe is rather good for lunch considering you can have a bottle with lunch at cost (all of what $8?). Montezuma wines are not my thing but again, I recommended it for the honey spirits as something different to try. Wagner has a great beer (Sled dog) but the wines aren't remotely great and frankly we usually only stop there because they are the last to close."
wine,3b5j27,sheaness,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:18:34 2015 UTC,"I'm at school in the area and plan on doing a wine tour later in the summer. Could you give me your general thoughts on which wineries are notable for which varietals? I'm planning this for my gf's parents so I'm not quite sure what style of wine they're into  Also, I did a tasting of whites with Damiani at triphammer wines the other day. My friend was really fond of their 2012 dolce bianco which is primarily riesling and not too sweet; their sauvignon blanc also had really great tropical fruit in the nose but didn't really deliver on flavor IMO. And I think we tried the cabernet franc but something taste pretty wrong, but I might chalk that up to being a bad experience"
wine,3b5j27,jojodancer5,2,Fri Jun 26 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"Few wineries focus on specific varietals. Many will offer at least a Cabernet Franc, several types of Riesling, and Chardonnay or Gewurz. If you don't want to spend a lot of time visiting every winery, you should be able to find decent examples of those wines at most places.  Besides that, here's something I typed up before:   For red wines, I'd say that you should stop at Red Tail Ridge, Damiani, and Kings Garden. (Kings Garden also has a late harvest Chardonnay you should try.) If you want a port style, go into Red Newt Wine Cellars and try the Hellbender. If you have time on the weekend and someone serious about wine is with you stop into Bloomer Creek -- and don't miss his whites, either. For sweet wines, go ahead and visit Earle Estates Meadery, Three Brothers, Fox Run, and Penguin Bay. (I prefer Earle Estates and Fox Run out of all those, but the others are tourist traps, which might be what you're looking for.) For food you have to stop at Jerlando's in Watkins Glen and the Stonecat Cafe in Hector. Otherwise, as another poster said, Beef & Brew is all right. Then if you want to experience some great whites, book appointments at Kemmeter Wines and Boundary Breaks. Then stop into Hermann J. Wiemer and, if you can make the trip out to Keuka Lake, Domaine LeSeurre. Riesling is our crowning glory, but Chardonnay and Gewürztraminer from good producers (like the ones I've listed) are also great.  PM if you're interested in more."

I was at a tasting recently, had that exact moment you're describing, and said ""wisteria"" where everyone else said ""violet"". I probably either mixed them up in my mind or the word ""violet"" just didn't come to me as fast. The smells are very, very similar. Purple floral. It's fine.  Also, just speaking freely and giving yourself permission to not always be right will help with this. You won't feel as on the spot about it."
wine,3b2q3m,cultiverjardin,2,Thu Jun 25 14:19:49 2015 UTC,"Reinhardt's book was a disappointment. I got the feeling that selection for inclusion had more to with how photogenic the winemaker was than anything else. Although to his credit, he makes a point of saying that the 70 winemaker profiles were not meant to be a ""Top 70,"" but were his own highly subjective choices. And his introductions to the various regions are very good.  While it is not exclusively about Germany, Terry Theise's ""Reading Between The Wines"" has a lot to say about German Riesling (Reinhardt quotes him in his own book's introduction.)"

On the weekends or when I open something special I'll reach for red burgundy, domestic cab, cote rotie, CdP, BDX etc)"
wine,3b2pxa,Oldpenguinhunter,2,Thu Jun 25 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"Most Italian wines that are food friendly and approachable in the way you seem to be looking for aren't going to cost you $125. That may be why you've had no luck. Most of the heavy-hitting expensive bottles from Italy are going to be big crazy old complicated shit like Barolos, Brunellos, etc.   I'm not sure I can make good recommendations for you, because I've never spent over $100 on a bottle before, and even my all-time favorite out of my price range wine (Schoolhouse Pinot Noir from Napa) is like $60. But we have very similar taste in wine styles, so I'll give it a try.  Right now, having just come back from Tuscany, my favorite wine I had on the whole trip was a Rosso di Montalcino from Fattoria dei Barbi. Just whatever their current release in Italian supermarkets is. In fact, I later had their 2007 Brunello and I also fucking adored it. And that might be more in your price range (actually probably still significantly under, but the Rosso was under 20 Euro in a supermarket). If you're going for Brunello, supposedly 2010 was a fantastic year.   In Italian wine in general, I tend to strongly prefer wines from the Veneto to the big heavy reds Italy is known for. You might want to try Soave (which is a white), Valpolicella, and Amarone (which is probably your best bet for high-dollar wines from the Veneto). I've not had Bardolino, but it's another well-known wine from the Veneto.  I don't know what wine in Texas is like, but here in California I've been pretty disappointed with Italian wines only to discover that most of the shops have last year's releases. Which I think can be deadly for simple food-friendly wines that aren't meant to be aged."

It's less thanks $125 (but you can probably buy some past vintages that can get up there).  I'd say that, or Amarone- but Amarone can be an acquired taste.  I like Allegrini's Amarones (Bertani is great too)- but again, this isn't costing you $125.00.  I mean you can spend the $125.00, but it isn't really necessary to knock your socks off."

Anything delicate like high end pinot Noir, Fino sherries or single pasteurized sake, I would even store in the fridge just to keep the temps constant. The thermometer recommend is a good idea as temperature fluctuation is worse than constant high temps, but being in NY myself, I know these apartments can get damn hot in the summer.

If you love strong, red wine then Italy has a plethora of choices for that basic structure. As for a simple, basic infographic, try this (remember, things can vary depending on region, producer, but can be used a general rule):  Red Wine Cheat Sheet"
wine,3b080v,draymond3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:54:27 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, this is a pretty large request and I don't think most of us could break that down to all the varietals and all the regions.  I don't know if really anyone could in the world.  Wine is a massive, massive world.    But to start off, all of the grapes you mentioned are ""Bordeaux"" grapes (from France) and aren't typically planted in Italy as Italy has many many incredible native grapes itself (Sangiovese, Nebbiolo for examples).  There are exceptions of course (the IGT super tuscans in tuscany) that do use Bordeaux grapes .  What region are you in Italy?  For example Tuscany, Piedmont, valpolicella??  I can try and explain some of the varietals if you give me a particular region."
wine,3b080v,Slippyy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:00:24 2015 UTC,"Take photos of the bottles, that way they can be deciphered for you!  Italian wine uses a lot of indigenous grape varietals. The big ones are Sangiovese, Nebbiolo, maybe Barbera. For more information try the FAQ, introductory wine books like Windows on the World or The Sommelier's Prep Course, and google. Your questions are pretty impossible to answer with anything less than a book!  As for countries...France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Chile are the major producers of quality red wine in all manner of styles. You'd have to be more descriptive to get more specific answers :)"
wine,3b080v,madkent,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:27:37 2015 UTC,"The bad news here is that this is a difficult question to answer as it's very broad.  The good news is that it sounds like you're at the start of a journey of discovering wine where learning is (at least) half of the pleasure. You will indeed find that different grapes have different characteristics but it's difficult in this format to anyone break them all down. You will also find particularly in Italy that there are a huge amount of local obscure grapes making lovely wine. It's maybe the most complicated wine country in the world but there's a lot of wonderful wine there though so a perfectly good place to start.  As /u/CondorKhan has pointed out, the newbies guide has a good basic run down of varieties and regions which is well worth reading. I also found these revision cards https://quizlet.com/15043629/wset-level-2-grape-varieties-flash-cards/original which I like for giving a basic indicator of how the climate makes a difference to the basic style of the grape too which I think is a useful 'basic' principle to get used to."

She just spreads to much misinformation, and her ""interviews"" are obnoxious. She spends the whole time interupting and talking over people instead of listening and giving these actually knowledgeable people a chance to speak."

If it is something that might fill a hole in my list, I'll at least taste it. If it is something I'm likely to enjoy then ditto.  All of the listed points though are pretty irrelevant. I am especially unlikely to be impressed by polished and prominent marketing."
wine,3ar2mn,NorthernerWuwu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:40:32 2015 UTC,"If it's good tasting wine, does presentation matter?  At Whole Foods in Houston this one time, there was this very energetic young lady doing samples of wine.  It was a decent bottle, don't remember the brand, but she was so optimistic.  Me and my husband chatted with her for a moment, and learned her car broke down and she was 30min late for setting up the tasting and we were her first people to taste that day.  We bought 3 bottles.  The experience was a very small table, with enough room for 3 wine bottles and several plastic cups.  But the engaging sales rep & the wine that sold us."
wine,3ar2mn,SilverWingsofMorning,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:15:04 2015 UTC,"Right but we are coming at this from different perspectives here.  I buy wine for the restaurant and I'm sampling them not so much to see if I like them but to see how they might fit into my list and if they are capable of earning more money for the place than the alternatives. I simply cannot be swayed by the rep's enthusiasm and frankly, after a while you doubt the sincerity there anyhow.  What do I want in the brand representative? Information at hand, not pushy, capable of answering any and all questions and not trying to (overly) bullshit me. Save the marketing speak for the retail crowd. I don't really want to be engaged; I don't have time for that and I'm going to filter it out for the most part anyhow.  It all depends on why I'm there of course though. I do attend a number of tastings where I'm there to just taste wine for my personal education and enjoyment. Then, engage away! I am an enthusiast after all. If it's business though, just let me do my thing and be a resource but not an obvious salesperson."

wine,3ar2mn,SilverWingsofMorning,2,Tue Jun 23 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on who you are catering your sales to. We've been trying to be mindful with our branding and events that women account for something like 75% of wine sales (beverage sales, not collecting sales). That has certainly informed our labels and setup for events: which really means we ask our wives what they think of our designs and listen to them :) I would spend some time searching wine on Instagram and Pinterest for good ideas"
wine,3ar2mn,mowineco,2,Mon Jun 22 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"I really like tasting verticals from some good producers, so I guess that's one thing."
wine,3ar2mn,NOLAWinosaur,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:03:56 2015 UTC,"I did a vertical tasting one time for a French wine.  We tasted 4 wines, and it was 4 to 6 verticals of those 4 wineiries.  17 glasses total.  It was very interesting, you could really taste that 1 year where a Wine Maker took a year off and they had another Maker in that year.  But unless you just tasted 8 wines from the same neighbourhood, and then that 9th, I wouldn't have noticed.  Verticals can be a fun experience."
wine,3ar2mn,SilverWingsofMorning,2,Tue Jun 23 16:17:59 2015 UTC,"These are my own personal impression : 32 year old dude, former restaurant owner.  Following your order :  1 ) Table looks : Physical aspect of the table has zero impact on me whatsoever. I'm used to just regular folding table with white linen on top.  2) Branding : Actually, I'm gonna take back what I wrote in one. Anything that helps me to anchor my mind, so to speak, helps. Wine tastings can be very overwhelming. Help me situate your before I say hi. Help me remember you.  3) Many wines :  I've seen some agency that would have 4-5 pourers on a super long table with like 35 different wines. I will actually avoid these tables. I can't ask a single pourer to walk me through the 35 different wines. And I can't just drop my pourer and go speak to the guy/girl standing right next. Should I just randomly pick a couple of wines?  4) Few wines : Yes. The setup described above could be slightly spaced out, with 1 pourer dedicated to 5 wines. That's it. I don't feel like I'm taking too much of the person's time. And I can just move on to the next when I'm done (or comeback later).   5) Rare wines :  Yes. But then I understand why you wouldn't want to pour away 6 cases of your most expensive wine. Back when I used to go to tastings (left the industry), I'd search for wines I could sell; i.e. wines I would pay between $12 and $30 a bottle for. The nice stuff was just for my own personal pleasure.  6) Commentary pourer : Yes. I mean I want someone knows his shit. Don't care for your tasting notes. I want to know what varietals are in, where it's from, how it was made; what makes every bottle different from each other. I'll have to admit that I love love love beautiful women. Passion, though, meh...  7) Pour and STF : Not really no. I often feel these people hate being there and I'm an annoyance for them. I need at least a couple of words.  8) Size of the pour : Small please! I don't need more than 2 sips to taste it and I hate, hate, hate to throw away wine that haven't touched my lips in front of the people who sell it/make it. But then again, I've never paid for my pours (industry tastings) so maybe that would be different at a tasting with coupons.  9) Medals and scores means absolutely nothing. I mean a 99 Wine Spectator, sure let me know, but otherwise; meh.  10) Varietal : I'm from Quebec where French wines occupy at least 33% if not more of the shelf space in our state run liquor store. Wines are organized by French regions and country. It was very peculiar to me to see wine  organized by varietals in an American wine store. All that to say that I mentally approach wine by region first, varietal second. But the market in which I ""grew up"" can be the reason for that. Unusual varietals are awesome; anything I learn is amazing.  11) Packaging : Packaging is paramount, but that is something that is I find a bit outside the scope of tastings. I mean, you should have labels that reflect the style of the wine. If it's something funky, don't go for the Old French Chateau look. If it's a serious, complex wine; don't put animals or bicycles on the label. I mean... this topic could warrant 10+ articles. I suck at Design, but I recognize it has huge effect on me.  12) Large format : Makes absolutely no difference whatsoever to me.  13) iPad : Eeeeewwwwwwwwwww"

I absolutely hate being told what flavors I should taste. Everyone's palate is different and tasting notes very from taster to taster. What I want to know from a pourer is how it was made, what varietals, where it was made, and how long it should age."
wine,3ar2mn,inphx,2,Wed Jun 24 16:18:39 2015 UTC,Library wines and verticals get me going
wine,3ar2mn,CondorKhan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:10:34 2015 UTC,"Library wines always get people stirred up. They're usually rare or unavailable to the general public which gives them additional perceived value and it allows the pourer an opportunity to talk about the winery's history which leads to present and future. Now you've got the taster engaged and the pretty pictures of the cellar/vineyards on the tablet lend further identity to the place where this piece of history hails from and you're selling them on the story.   I'll roll my eyes at medals but any score over 92 from a known critic will catch my attention.  Humans are herd animals. If the pourer can tell a fun story/maintain conversations people will come over to see the popular table. Showmanship is, IMHO, the most important thing a table can have (#2 is good wine). Inviting but not aggressive or desperate."
wine,3ar2mn,LueyTheWrench,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:15:40 2015 UTC,"What I look for is something new. If I go cellar door crawling I won't try the same varietals over and over again, I'll look for what the different wineries are doing that is unique.   I do also love interesting commentary, particularly if the pourer can offer some history of the brand/winery and some insights into the winemaker's decisions."
wine,3ar2mn,SilverWingsofMorning,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:29:07 2015 UTC,"I am imagining you are asking for almost an industry level event.  I am non-industry.  But at food tastings and social events where is more options then space in my tummy:   I don't want an ""experience"" where I have figure out how to get the sample.  There was someone doing Chili in Frito Chip Bags and it was self serve.  There was an expectation that everyone knew that you served Chili in Frito Bags.  As a non-America, I was still figuring out what Fritos were. I am generally novice in comparison to many in this forum.  I don't mind a very brief explanation of the wine.  I don't mean educate me on the fermentation process, but say a topic fact about the wine. If everyone working the table is all suit & tie, and looking very serious.  I'd probably try the wine, but remember the stuffiness of the group.  I like Nickle & Nickle wine, but I haven't purchased a bottle since remembering how serious everyone was at the vineyard.  Maybe, because if I am picking up a pricey bottle I want to remember happy fun times. At a wine dinner one time that was a retirement party, something that worked really well was people signing a large format bottle, and at the end of the night the retiring guy took it home.  A lot of people enjoyed the interaction of signing the bottle.   The Seven Learning Styles    Visual (spatial):You prefer using pictures, images, and spatial understanding.

wine,3ar2mn,Socrates5150,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"Weather I step up to a table or not has so many variables, but the most important thing once I am there is a person who is knowledgeable about the product. What are the growing practices, Lutte Reason, organic, bio, conventional and why. Also is it machine or hand harvested (None of these necessarily make a better wine, but I want to be able to give my customers as much info as possible)? And in the cellar, native yeasts or commercial, oak usage, cement, amphora, steel? how much is produced, will I be able to run with it for a while if I pick it up or is this a one or two time order?"

wine,3aoo2o,stlunatic15,4,Mon Jun 22 06:25:29 2015 UTC,"We decanted it for a good 2, maybe 2 1/2 hours. So incredibly soft and delicate. Not much fruit was left but I still tasted some black currant and spice notes, with very soft tannins. Peak drinkability says anywhere from 2009-2029, according to Parker. The cork broke when we opened it, but luckily it didn't drop through. Overall, it was a great experience to have on this Father's Day."
wine,3aoo2o,idog73,15,Mon Jun 22 06:32:04 2015 UTC,"That's way to long to decant a 25 year old wine IMO but if you enjoyed it that's all that matters. It probably would have retained a lot more fruit, though."
wine,3aoo2o,cmshort21,7,Mon Jun 22 15:56:39 2015 UTC,"I second this.  Edit: just to add a little info in case you are wondering how to handle older wine, typically you're going to want to wait to open and decant for sediment right before serving so the wine doesn't oxidize. Obviously there are exceptions to this rule, ie. Old Port and things of that nature but in general the less oxygen the wine is exposed to the better."
wine,3aoo2o,claretyportman,3,Mon Jun 22 16:34:52 2015 UTC,"Just to add a different opinion- I find serious 1990 Bordeaux (as this one is) still very much benefit from pretty lengthy decanting. I've actually had the chance to play around a fair amount with this and I find something like 3 hours is about what i'd aim for. I would say similar for top end 1989s too, though the other few vintages either side wouldn't be the same.  I would agree with what you say for the vast majority of 25 year old wines, but would add that I think the key is not how old the wine is- but how much life it still has in it so you need to take each wine on its individual merits. If you ask me this still has many years ahead of it, at least another decade, and opens up very nicely with some time in the decanter."

If you really want a whimsical vintage, I would recommend one of the less good more recent years like 2002 or 2007, both of which show poorly on a vintage chart but there are great wines and great value from both, which both tend to drink as if they were 5 or 10 years more mature than they are due to the 'lightness' of the vintage. Try Grand Puy Lacoste from either, or Haut Bailly and Pontet Canet from 2007, all wonderful."

Here are some issues off the top of my head for our area: disease, pest management (2 new fruit flies in the last few years, this can be linked to globalization: one is from Brazil), following the current wine fashion (we have to be ahead of the game on this as it takes at the very least 3 years to plant a new varietal and make wine from it), WEATHER (weather will always be unpredictable, and climate change is one thing, but many people don't consider that climate change seems to be bringing more extreme single season events more often, like the derecho of 2013, or the arctic vortex pwning n. America this past winter), growing a local winery at the appropriate speed (can't make too much and can't make too little wine), the ever changing marketing world (knowing how to cater to each social media), etc. I can provide more thoughts if you pick a more specific topic, just send me a message :) edit: added the arctic vortex"
wine,3aqxbp,azdak,2,Mon Jun 22 20:59:24 2015 UTC,"You can make amazing wine, but if you don't know how to market it and sell it, you're hosed. Dudes graduate from UCD thinking they're gonna make the great american cabernet and score 94pts on their first vintage, and the shit's just going to sell itself. You probably won't and it probably won't. Or you hit the lottery, ride a boost in sales, fail to build a brand or a loyal following, and then you hit a bad vintage, you're forced to discount, and you're hosed because you can basically never jack your prices up again."

After an hour of decanting, the more complex aromas were able to reveal themselves in blackberries, ripe red fruit and well-integrated delicate oak. It is a light-bodied Merlot, developing firm tannins on the mid-palate, leaving a spicy, sour cherry finish along with some heat.  Well done Barboursville, well done."

wine,3amojx,TheLadyLawyer,14,Sun Jun 21 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"Dude. If you like that, wait till you've had a proper Greek wine, and not just an international-style wine grown in Greece.   The Greeks, of course, have been growing grapes and making wine for thousands of years, so there are tons of grape varieties native to Greece. But in the second half of the 20th century Greek winemakers found that these native varietals didn't sell as well as the classic French varietals, which were better known internationally. Indigenous grapevines were ripped out and replaced with Merlot and Chardonnay and other exportable grapes.  However, in the last 20-30 years, the native Greek grapes are experiencing a resurgence.  The big red ones are Agiorgitiko and Xynomavro, and the classic Greek white is Assyrtiko. Check them out next time... I particularly like Agiorgitiko. Someone more experienced in Greek wine can give more specific recommendations!"

Wine retail is sweaty, boring, frustrating work. For every customer you connect with, for every awesome wine loving customer, there are 50 to 100 that just don't give a fuck about you. At a smaller store, or a wine specialty store, this ratio will be lower: but expect to be treated like shit regularly.  For every moment you get to taste a nice wine and get paid for it, for every moment you get to have an insightful conversation with a rep or brand ambassador, there are a thousand where you're sweatily passing crates from the back of a truck or building the nth display for the morning or dusting shelves or changing tickets etc. Expect to be working your ass off for not much pay (better here in Australia but still not much).  For every moment where you learn something new, where you get to take the time to read the back of a wine label, there are another thousand where you're mind numbingly facing every row of the store until it looks perfect for the next day and you're getting hounded by someone like me (probably younger than you) because you're not turning bottles just so.  My point is that retail is hard work. Just because it involves something you're passionate about, doesn't mean you'll like it. Good way to get your foot in the door, but be ready for the shit that comes with it! And if you're used to making good money where you are doing whatever you're doing, remember that retail will pay nowhere near that. Any idiot can stand on a register and 'sell' wine, etc."

I guess it really depends what you want to do. Do you want to work in restaurants (sommelier, winewaiter), bottleshops, as a sales rep, as a cellar door manager or in wine production (lab tech, cellar hand, winemaker, bottling supervisor, vineyard manager). I've done pretty much everything. Waiter, bottleshop customer service, vineyard hand, cellar hand, assistant winemaker, labbie, vineyard manager. Haven't been a rep or a cellar door guy though.   I guess before we can progress, we need to know what your goal is. Do you want to sell wine, make wine or promote wine? Do you want to work with customers, clients, winemakers or vignerons? Do you see yourself living in the city or the country? Do you like regular hours, hospitality hours or seasonal work? Do you want to study or work your way up? If I could have it over again I would have studied oenology straight out of high school, but it's a bit much to expect a kid with no family wine heritage to be into wine at 17 and a half...   So yeah, answer those few things and then I can make some suggestions. That said, there's no RIGHT way to have success in this industry, and I don't pretend to be the be all and end all on this subject. I got to where I am by a very circuitous route..."
wine,3alwq0,Wicclair,2,Sun Jun 21 21:53:36 2015 UTC,"Can I ask some questions? I graduated with my bachelor's in philosophy from sonoma state university. Wanted to bring nor.cal back home with me (live in so.cal and developed a love for wine, because I lived in wine country haha) so I decided to planted a small backyard vineyard (40 vines). It was a great success, I read every book I found on how to grow grapes and make wine.  I have decided to move back up north and go to santa rosa junior college who offers associate degrees in oenology and viticulture (I'm planning on doing both, which will take me a year and a half since I don't have to take general education). Is an associates degree enough to enter into this field? I looked into davis and other universities because bachelor's > associates but they don't accept students looking for 2nd degree seeking students. So I'm stuck with associates unless I take much more math and science classes to be able to apply for their masters program. I really really enjoy growing my vines these past 4 months. But I think I would really enjoy making wine as well and creating something truly special. Im not 100 percent sure which side I want to go into. I'm leaning towards oenology but I think growing the grapes is more fun, being outside, not sitting at a desk all day (I guess making wine isn't really like that anyways). Can you describe the pros and cons of each of these two and why you liked one over the other? I'm really really excited about getting into the wine industry but I feel a little lost. I don't know how I feel about being a vineyard manager because of having to take care of dozens-hundreds of acres of grape vines. It seems a little overwhelming... Also what does an assistant winemaker do? Is it just a glorified cellar rat? Haha"
wine,3alwq0,dirtysouthwine,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:38:53 2015 UTC,"I guess an associate degree is like what we call a post graduate diploma in Australia? At the end of the day, a degree or technical qualification only gives you so much.   I'd go the oenology stream, even though I too really love the vineyard and would prefer to spend my days out in the sun than in the cellar or lab. Unfortunately, vineyard guys get very little of the kudos when a wine does well at a show or in the press, and generally you'll be payed a lot less. Also, from what I've seen online (and I could be mistaken so tell me if I am) a lot of vineyard work is performed by south american immigrants in Cali, yeah? And probably they're notoriously underpaid for their labour. You could aim for a vineyard manager's role, but that would usually require an agriculture qualification. Soil science is a big deal in the vinyard, and if they're cover-cropping you'll need a pretty good agronomy background too. Not too many vineyard jobs that pay well in Oz, and a lot of it is managing teams of workers (can be quite the handfull!), maintenance issues and water stocks (if they irrigate). Pretty dull stuff. At vintage you'll be pulling harvester shifts almost always at night, since it's better for quality to pick when the temps are low, especially for whites. The vineyard manager where I worked was even more frazzled during vintage than us winery staff on midnight to midday shift. That gives you an idea...  Oenology is interesting from a science point of view. Especially when you make ppm additions that transform a wine into something unexpected. Seen some chardys post-malo that stank as all f**k for example and then after a simple PMS add brightened up something amazing. That was cool the first time I saw that happen. Lab work can be boring sometimes, but I like looking at the numbers. Seeing numbers for TA pH VA Malic molecular SO2 etc are great analysis tools that really show where your fruit/juice/wine/whatever is at, and it's fundamental to know when it comes to quality, unless you're lucky enough to have awesome fruit every year no matter what and a great team of cellar hands who know their stuff, which not many of us are. Also, you feel like you're part of the inner sanctum in some ways. Even if you're ""just"" an assistant winemaker, you'll get to take part in blending trials and addition trials, which is an awesome way to build your palate and really fine tune your analytical tasting skills. Nothing at university ever gets close to hands on experience in the winery. Making press cuts of juice is something you only get to do for a few weeks each year, and it's just something you'll learn in situ during vintage, and it's just so damn important.  And assistant winemakers are definitely more than just glorified cellarhands (though an irrelavent argument could be made to suggest a sommelier is just a glorified waiter...). Being Vintage Assistant Winemaker in a medium to large winery means you create job orders for additions and transfers, and you'll be managing a team of cellarhands. You're a conduit between the Senior Winemaker and the cellar team. If there are issues with a wine (clarification, smells, stuck ferments etc.) you need to identify it and bring it to the attention of management who may be on a different shift to you too. It's quite a responsible role, and very eye-opening. An Assistant Winemaker outside of vintage would be creating most of the job orders too.

wine,3alwq0,dirtysouthwine,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"Is an associates degree enough to enter into this field?   No and Yes.  It isn't enough to get you hired, but it might help with getting an internship which if you are the last intern standing is the most common way people get hired.   Also what does an assistant winemaker do?    In most cases the Asst.actually makes the wine (with the direction of the winemaker).    Don't knock cellar rats."
wine,3alwq0,Wicclair,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:43:14 2015 UTC,"I don't see how my comment knocked on cellar rats. I had read the winemaker is the one who actually makes the wine. And the assistant winemaker does everything the cellar rats do plus helps the winemaker out. If my comment came off that way, it wasn't my intention at all. Why would I knock a job that I am trying to get??"
wine,3alwq0,dirtysouthwine,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:40:26 2015 UTC,"""Also what does an assistant winemaker do? Is it just a glorified cellar rat? Haha""   Your comment made it sound like a cellar rat was a low unglorified position.  To the outside world maybe it is, but coming from someone that is asking advice on positions and enrolling in school, it is something you should aspire to.  You would be very lucky to be hired on as a cellar worker with or without a degree and less than a couple vintages under your belt."
wine,3alwq0,MarcellusF,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:51:42 2015 UTC,"Well, we can have a difference of opinions on it on how it sounded because to me, that is not what I would believe it meant. It wasn't my intention for how it came across and I apologize that it offended you.  Maybe instead of assuming what I had meant, you can ask me? So we don't have an argument and have misunderstandings<3  edit: When I had googled what assistant winemakers do before I had asked you, and what cellar rats do, everything the cellar rats do is under what the assistant winemaker does, but the assistant winemaker manages a little bit more (making sure the cellar rats are doing everything theyre supposed to plus some things on the business side, setting up tastings, tours), which is the reason for my comment. It isn't saying the cellar rats is a low position at all, it's saying that an assistant winemaker is doing exactly what a cellar rat does but a little bit more. Of course, this is all from google. Which is why I asked for your opinion. And thanks for your input."

wine,3alwq0,Lady_Bluebeard,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"OK. I'm just going to answer all of the quoted questions as best I can, because to be honest I'm not sure where I see myself in terms of selling, making, or promoting.   Do you want to work with customers, clients, winemakers or vignerons?  Clients and/or customers most likely, second would be winemakers. I can most easily see myself as an importer or someone else who works with both winemakers and consumers. While I've loved my time working in the vineyard, my aptitude does not lie in agriculture. I'm happy to do whatever the vigneron says, but the idea of eventually being that person scares me. Similarly, being the winemaker scares me, and also I'm pretty sure you have to be good at sciencey stuff for that. In fact, that's the main deciding factor for a career in wine -- what can I do that doesn't require me to become a scientist first?  Do you see yourself living in the city or the country?  No significant preference, though I currently live in a city and have done so my entire adult life. I grew up in the country, and I've really enjoyed the time I just spent working at a winery in the country.   Do you like regular hours, hospitality hours or seasonal work?  This is a hard question since, in my current career, I work all hours. I like knowing where I'm going to be tomorrow morning, and what days I have off next week. But I'm not bothered about whether that's morning or evening, or whether I have weekend days off, or whether I'm done by 6pm. I would enjoy anything where I don't have to work 14 hours a day all the time, which is standard in my current line of work.  Do you want to study or work your way up?  Ideally work my way up, or find a way in that uses qualifications I already have (A BA in the social sciences, 10 years of experience in film production). But I'm not afraid of hard work. I'm leery of getting a degree that might be useless.   I'm curious to know what advice you'd give me."
wine,3alwq0,Wicclair,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:23:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. Been in the vineyard this week, and it's been stinking hot and quite draining.  It sounds to me like you're not too keen on the production side of things. If I were you, I'd go into wine repping. Working in a wineshop even as a manager doesn't remunerate as well as working for a distributor, or better yet starting you're own distribution of interesting wines you're passionate about.   Winemaking is my passion, but I don't expect it to be for everyone who's interested in wine. With out passionate advocates for our product, we don't make any money, and there's only so much a winemaker can sell out of the back of their truck on the weekend! haha (though there are some small producers who resent paying a distributer a cut and sell all their wine online or from the trunk of their car to restaurants and bottleshops! They're usually the very tired and weary looking ones...)  You should probably do a WSET wine course, and try to get as many of those under your belt as you can. Working a vintage as an intern would give you great insight into the origin of what you're selling, but it's not essential. Taste as much as you can. Visit all the wineries in your area. Build your palate. You can't sell wine if you can't talk about it meaningfully, so you need to study up.  If you're keen for a more settled life, maybe try applying for a cellar door role and work your way up to cellar door manager. That can be pretty satisfying, and you meet a lot of interesting people when they come through for tastings.   Where I work, the cellar door manager is also responsable for sales in the region where the winery is situated, while a wine distribution company handles state and interstate sales. She gets to mix up a bit of cellar door work with on the road sales as well as organising promotional events in the region. Also, her hours are sweet. 8.00 till 16.30 Monday to Friday, and she gets to boss around cellar door staff. Sometimes I resent how easy she has it, and how well she gets paid for what she does. But it's unfair of me to say that. Her role is important and deserves to be remunerated generously.   Working in this industry is more a lifestyle choice than a money making guarantee. It's fun, and you get to drink awesome wine and eat great food and meet like-minded people. Repping is a tough gig, as you're basically a salesperson, so you need to be pretty confident and know how to take rejection. But if you're good, you can move a lot of stock, and that translates into cash. Having your own distribution company someday is definitely a goal to aim for, if you want to be a passionate spokesperson for wine producers you genuinely like. It's definitely doable, you just need to get into it and start learning.  Not much more I can say really."
wine,3alwq0,Wicclair,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:36:26 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thanks for the thoughtful response! I am definitely thinking more along the lines of cellar door/distribution, probably more towards distribution considering that I don't live directly in a major wine-producing region. Also, I have to admit, if I have one really great passion about wine, it would be discovering interesting new wines and sharing them with people. Which sounds like being a distributor/wine rep! Also, of the wine jobs I've learned about, that side of things seems the most interesting to me."
wine,3alwq0,square_mile,3,Sun Jul 5 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"Relationships is key in this industry. As people have said - frequent wine bars and tune in to possible opportunities or advice. Keep saying - I want to get in this business, how'd you get started? Any advice on what I could do?  Be resilient. When people aren't giving you much ground - try and take what ground you can.   Also: it's hard work! First day of work my employer told me ""if you think you're gonna be swirling wine and relaxing a lot then Youl quit within the year. If you're ready to work hard, be confident, humble, resilient - and willing to study and learn - then Youl probably stick around."" The wine swirling and relaxing is there I PROMISE but consider it a reward for your hard work and not something you're entitled to.   Don't forget how much you love wine - that's what got you started with this interest. When you're down or tired and kinda just like wow this is hard or blah blah - remember how much joy wine has given you and then think about how cool it is to be on the other end doing the work that allows other people to find that same joy you found."

Deep garner color. A little funk on the nose which scared the shit out of me since I just had a corked bottle. There's still a little funk but it's not bad. Makes me wonder...can a corked wine be 20% corked? 50% corked? 100% corked?  The nose still has a funk kind of smell. The viscosity is medium. Acidity medium. I taste high alcohol, blueberries, and eh. Its finish poor.   Fuck. Can a wine be 50% corked? Is that a thing??? Honestly this wine is okay but it has issues.   Am I the only one?"

Still, I'd kinda like to get a bottle that would cost me more than $200 on my own!  I don't mind paying a large amount for the total bill but I'd rather not feel like I'm getting ripped off.

With the proximity of vineyards to eucalyptus/gum trees, there is a possibility for a transfer of aromatics from the trees to the fruit, or by getting leaves into the fermenting juice. Italy might have a more refined, austere profile, maybe some brett, but I'm sure there is a cab running around there that could be a ringer for Napa if it tried. If you're in the US, these should be pretty easy to find, even if you can't get the same vintage. Would be a good tasting."

Italy makes very few varietal cabs that I am aware of, happy to be corrected, but in general - from my experience, yours may differ - Coonawarra cabs will show strong jammy black fruits and often hints of mint, menthol, or eucalyptus in the background. White pepper is another common theme from the region. Margaret River cabs, far enough away to be in a different country, tend to show a little more complexity in their fruit (IMO) and the odd chocolatey note.   I have no experience with Californian cabs so can't comment as to the comparison - but as you can see, within a country, even within a region styles can change dramatically. Margaret River has six or seven proposed sub regions. So from country to country you can expect wild differences in style. Hope this helps!"

That helps a lot, some of their cheap wines are worth it if you know what to get!  First, introduce your friends to how Chileans treat carmenere, a grape they claim as their own. Try the Panilonco Carmenere, it's $3.99 here in California at TJ's. You can learn more about Carmenere here  Next, try comparing some affordable wines from one country with the same varietals from another country. See if your local grocery store or large liquor store carries wines from Lindemann's, from Australia. Their Shiraz is pretty good for the price (less than $8), and you can compare that to the Trader Joe's Coastal Syrah (~$5), which I think is probably the best under $5 bottle you can find.  You can do the same with their cab sav or merlot.  Another comparison you can make is between a really cheap wine, like the Trader Joe's Charles Shaw merlot, and an $8-$10 bottle of California merlot. See if anyone can deacribe what makes them different, or even cover the labels and see if anyone can tell the difference.   I'd stay away from French or Italian wines if you're looking in the under $10 range, unless someone can recommend a really good one.

I also avoid young California cab. That's my PREFENCE and clearly different than the majority of Americans. I just don't find it interesting. There are far more entertaining wines to be had at the same price point.   Famille Perrin cotes du Rhone are awesome and super super easy to find. If you can find two vintages of those I like to taste them side by side or as its referred to as a 'vertical'.   Another fun, interesting, and summery wine is Gewurtztraminer. Producers I like are villa wolf and brooks.   All the wines mentioned should be under 15 dollars.   Also Charles krug Sauvignon blanc is something I've found fun recently. Can't remember the price.   Fun stuff for me is to find same style, same region, same year, different producers and taste them back to back. You can vary this any way you want. Same producer, same region, different style. Same style, same year, different region. Same wine, same producer, different year  Have fun."

Brand new to me:  I have a customer who says she has a nickel allergy and can't have wine that has ever seen the inside of a stainless steel tank. I know that's not impossible, but it's annoying as hell. Is this even a real allergy?  Fun times."
wine,3aenh3,winemule,3,Fri Jun 19 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"It's a real skin allergy. I can't find anything about ingesting nickel. I suspect your customer has confused the skin problem with an overall problem. If your customer can drink pasteurized milk, she can drink wine fermented in stainless steel tanks."
wine,3aenh3,JaySin777,2,Fri Jun 19 17:37:10 2015 UTC,It's also in old pipes and ground water from time to time. At some point in time nearly everything a person drinks was in a steel container.
wine,3aenh3,Cunt_zapper,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"Except that milk is not acidic and probably spends much less time in SS than a wine that might be fermented and stored in SS for a year or more.   I'm not a metallurgist, but it seems like wine might be more likely to leach small amounts of nickel out of the steel than milk?"
wine,3aenh3,ChampagneFloozy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:59:19 2015 UTC,"But no wine is gonna sit in stainless for a year. A couple months, tops. Less if they are moving it to a barrel after fermentation.  Winemakers correct me if I'm wrong here."
wine,3aenh3,Cunt_zapper,3,Sat Jun 20 00:53:50 2015 UTC,"You're (sort of) wrong here.  I probably should have phrased it as ""up to a year"" because more than a year is probably rare.   Lots of wine never sees barrels and will be fermented and aged in tank. Sure, the cheaper wines probably will be sent to bottle long before a year has passed, but I have personally seen Chardonnay sit in steel tanks (with oak staves) for at least six months. When it's finally transferred off oak and lees guess where it goes?! That's right another SS tank! Until it is blended with other wine in barrel and then bottled a little over a year later."
wine,3aenh3,ChampagneFloozy,2,Sat Jun 20 01:36:24 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, and I am happy to stand corrected.

wine,3aenh3,winemule,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:14:13 2015 UTC,"Stainless steel in the presence of acidic substances apparently will leach chromium and nickel, but not in amounts considered harmful:  ""The concentration of nickel leach out in food products probably do not constitute hazard to consumer as the amount of nickel leached out is lower to that of recommended values of EPA (0.02mg/day)."" Source.  Is this information trustworthy? I'll say only that the study quoted was from the website of a business that sells ceramic cookware. Obviously, they have an axe to grind. The study quoted was of ""stainless tumblers and bowls used in India."" Is stainless made in India the same as stainless made elsewhere in the world? Beats me."
wine,3aenh3,Cunt_zapper,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:21:35 2015 UTC,"There is a particular grade of food safe SS required for wine production (I can't remember it at this moment). There are also certain things you should do when cleaning and prepping a tank to put wine into it in order to passivate the surface (restoring a later of chromium oxide, if I recall correctly) If you do all of these things I would assume that the amount of nickel and chrome leached is very small, if not immeasurable.   If care were not taken, or welds and other fittings were not made from the proper grade of SS I could see leaching being a problem if someone has some serious sensitivity. But, like I said, I'm no metallurgist and I'm a little rusty (no pun intended) on the relevant  chemistry (and know even less about the human/allergy/sensitivity part of things)."

wine,3aec1j,flitcroft,2,Fri Jun 19 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe try a smaller shop with more passionate staff or a California specialist. There are so many options. This is one of the most popular styles in the US and beyond. Here are some names that come to mind, in roughly descending order of recommendation:  To try to win: Joseph Phelps (Insignia is a traditional match to Caymus Special Selection) Opus One Dominus (note this is great but will be a slightly more old world profile in some years)  Solid choices; Silver Oak (Napa) Stag's Leap (Fay, in the closer to $100 range) Paul Hobbs Cain Dunn Chateau Montelena Cakebread Duckhorn Pride Heitz Togni"
wine,3aec1j,flitcroft,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:11:51 2015 UTC,"I've had and have loved wines with a Bordeaux style blend before, mainly the Insignia, but do you think that it would be noticeable having the other grape varieties when tasted right next to a complete cab? Silver Oak was probably my dad's favorite winery for a very long time (he has an Arvid painting of it in his basement), but I think the recent vintages have disappointed him. I'll consider getting it to see if they can tell that it's in there.   Your suggestions were completely on point though, almost too good, as I think that they've probably had almost of them, but it's always fun to throw in a favorite to see if they will spot it. I may go for the insignia but that price tag is steep for a wine that they won't fully appreciate until the blind tasting is over"
wine,3aec1j,winemule,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:49:43 2015 UTC,"No, I doubt that group (or most any) could identify a new world Cab blend if the style is geared toward rounding out and accentuating the Cabernet Sauvignon flavor. Legally in the US the TTB only requires 75% of a varietal to label it as varietal-specific so there are plenty of Cabernets that have Merlot, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot, etc in them without disclosing it. Unless they say 100% Cab on the label or website I'd assume it's a blend.  Here are some specific wines to consider that they may not have had (all from klwines.com). For some reason I think they'd like mountain fruit - which to me generally tastes better than valley fruit and may be interesting blind - so the list is heavy toward Spring Mountain at the north end of Napa in the Mayacamas Mountains:   1996 Pride Mountain Reserve Cab 2006 Pride Mountain Sonoma/Napa Reserve Cab 1999 Pride Mountain Cab ($80) 2004 Sherwin Family Vineyards Spring Mountain Cab ($85) 1991 Diamond Creek Volcanic Hill 1997 Dominus   Obviously, the other way to compete is with proper aging. I wouldn't go out and buy a 2012 Napa with 16% alcohol that will need six hours of decanting. But, if they're used to that style, wines circa 1995-2005 will provide a nice contrast and allow you to taste more complexity and often more fruit, after the tannins and alcohol integrate with slow oxidation.  Edit: I've been assuming you're okay with Caymus Special Selection pricing, which is unfortunately pretty typical of high-end Napa pricing. The 2012 is now $170 and properly aged bottles like the 1992 run $190+. I marked a couple <$100 wines above just because it seems a bit crazy, as you mentioned, to go too far over $100 blind for Napa juice. Another great budget choice is the 2010 Amici. With 2 hours of decanting it will compete with the big boys and runs $44 at K&L: http://www.klwines.com/p/i?s=14E0DC67CC6E&i=1129478. If you go with a current release vintage I'd highly suggest posting here or combing Cellar Tracker notes to see how long to decant before you pour the wine back into the bottle with a funnel and shove the cork back in. I do it all the time when I bring wine to dinner. Just be careful not to pierce all the way through the cork or it could leak on the car ride over.  Have fun!"

wine,3aec1j,Emperor_TaterTot,2,Fri Jun 19 15:01:39 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the group likes more fruit-driven cabs - a couple that come to mind:  Altamura, O'Shaughnessy and Realm.

wine,3ady45,HelenHuntsAss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:23:15 2015 UTC,very interesting and helpful. thanks! i always wonder about age ability with these wines. did the 97 WS gain weight?
wine,3ady45,Muppet_Mower,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:42:49 2015 UTC,Weight?  Not necessarily but it became more lush and generous on the palate.
wine,3abxpk,CondorKhan,9,Thu Jun 18 21:18:13 2015 UTC,Floozy is alive? and you guys in VA and didn't extend the invite? rude. We should do a Mid-Atlantic meet up

wine,3abxpk,ChampagneFloozy,6,Fri Jun 19 20:14:29 2015 UTC,"Hi y'all. Yes, the Flooze is alive, albeit very, very busy these days.  I had a blast visiting with u/Condorkhan. He's a fantastic cook and made both me and my girlfriend feel right at home. On top of that, he has a fantastic wife, an awesome dog, and the happiest freaking two year old I've ever met. I will add, too, props to both his wife and my lady for graciously humoring our supreme wine geekery.   For me, I'm not sure I could name a wine of the night. Maybe the Tondonia Blanco. Maybe the Gruner. Maybe the SGN. So much fantastic wine was had.  I feel very fortunate to have had this experience. Thank you Condor, and do let me know when you open the Kesselstatt I left behind."
wine,3abxpk,onehitwonder92,3,Fri Jun 19 02:35:09 2015 UTC,You are kind.  And many thanks for the Kesselstatt! It will die a swift death along with some panang curry.
wine,3abxpk,winemule,5,Fri Jun 19 03:05:59 2015 UTC,"So last weekend, it was my honor to invite for dinner  my co-mod /u/ChampagneFloozy, who was swinging around the DC area. Dinner had a completely Spanish theme. The menu was:  Appetizer 1: Jamon Iberico De Bellota, aged Mahon, olives Appetizer 2: Patatas Bravas Main Course: vaguely Valencian style Paella with pork, monkfish, chicken and chorizo, and a veggie Paella with mushrooms. Dessert: Apple Pie  2002 Lopez De Heredia Vina Tondonia Reserva Drinking fantastically well at the moment.  It smells like an oak paneled study full of old leatherbound volumes that have soaked up decades of fine cigar smoke.  On the palate, the taste of black cherries, smoke, leather and wood. Tannins perfectly integrated. Deliciously old school. I should have decanted this because it was by the last glass that this was starting to really, really sing. By the way, Patatas Bravas with red Rioja is one of the greatest pairings in the universe.  2000 Lopez De Heredia Vina Tondonia Reserva Blanco Pours deep gold tending to amber. Nose of almonds and apple. On the palate, flavors of almonds and hazelnuts along with red apple and pear. Supremely complex, and constantly evolving once its open. A fantastic bottle.  2004 Tegernseerhof Grüner Veltliner Bergdistel Supreme Gruner with some age on it. Pours golden. Aroma is a rush of peach and pepper. On the palate, immense concentration, peach, pineapple, red pepper, stony minerality and dare I say, some petrol? Outstanding. After having this, I don’t want to touch my 2012 FX Pichler Smaragd for another 10 years.  2007 Beck-Hartweg Gewurztraminer Selection de Grains Nobles A veritable hen’s tooth. Selection de Grains Nobles means botryitized grapes, and is the rarest and possibly finest category of Alsace wines. This bottle I purchased from Florian Beck Hartweg himself when I visited the domaine in Alsace. Pours deep golden. Intense lychee and tropical passionfruit aroma. Thick body with lychee, passionfruit, peach and some tangerine. Lots of complexity and length.   2010 Attilio Ghisolfi Barolo Bussia Bricco Visette Believe it or not, the first 2010 that I dare open, and it’s an incredible Barolo value.  Beautiful aroma of cherries and roses. On the palate, enormous black cherry, tar, violets. Loads of acid and massive tannins that soften up with air time. Actually drinking quite well now but this has decades ahead of it. Killer.  2012 Markus Molitor Haus Klosterberg Riesling A nice simple young Riesling. I had this open previously so we just finished the last remaining glass or so before moving on to the other stuff. Peaches, orange peel, smoke. Light body.  Equipo Navazos La Bota De Florpower “Mas Alla” This is, without a doubt, the single weirdest wine I’ve ever drank. This is basically unfortified sherry aged under flor, put out by the craziest and most experimental negociant in Sherryland, Equipo Navazos. I’m still trying to put words to this. Kerosene, nuts, seawater? Crazy good with the Jamon, the olives and the cheeses. This will have its own post in the next few days.  It was a beautiful evening. I’m glad that I had the chance to have these beautiful wines with someone who geeks out on it just as much."

wine,3abxpk,Vitalstatistix,2,Thu Jun 18 21:47:45 2015 UTC,I bought a bunch of the '12 Tegernseerhof GV Bergdistel Smaragd for $21 per from Floozy. It's been a crazy value I wish I could get more of. I would love to taste it with some more age.

wine,3adbwy,DangerSwan33,5,Fri Jun 19 04:46:23 2015 UTC,Why were you smelling the cork? Of course it smells like cork. It's cork.   But I do think you got a bad bottle and Mouton Cadet isn't awesome to begin with.
wine,3adbwy,CondorKhan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:23:17 2015 UTC,"I should clarify... when I opened it, I got a whiff of the cork, so I smelled it."
wine,3adbwy,madkent,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:45:24 2015 UTC,"Vinegary at all? Acetic acid might explain your sensation of burning, although you'd be very likely to smell the vinegaryness before you taste it.  Can you provide any more information? Pictures of the colour, more descriptions of the nose... or I'm sure one of the pros will have an answer for you.  I should add that there's a possibility the wine is just shit. Overextracted maybe? Could be shitty young tannins you're feeling. I've only tried the regular Mouton Cadet Rouge but boy was it rough."
wine,3adbwy,madkent,2,Fri Jun 19 05:04:08 2015 UTC,"The color is a pretty standard color.  Not brown at all.  Without a bottle of good wine next to it, you wouldn't be able to tell.    My first thought was vinegar taste, but honestly, I only know what vinegar SMELLS like, so I can't really pin it as that, but acidity certainly makes sense.  The wine has relatively good reviews, which is one of the reasons I tried it.  All in all, I may have actually come to the bottom of this... figuring there was no way I could drink more than this glass with it tasting like this... I mean, I COULD, but I'd be pushing myself, I figured what the hell, and tried the saran wrap in a bowl trick.  Whether it was pouring it in a bowl, essentially acting like a decanter, or the actual saran wrap itself, the taste is NOTICEABLY different.  So, yes, I think I got a bad bottle.  And yes, now I'm going to drink my bowl of wine."

The only sparkling wine producer I have much experience with is Quartz Reef, which is great stuff. (Actually, I've had some Rippon, too, but they stopped making bubbles a while ago.) I have to say the name made me chuckle to my punchy, early morning self: ""One man disgorged all these bottles by hand. He is... Alan McCorkindale.""  On the Daumas Gassac, their wines cellar magnificently, both red and white, and are well worth the extra time/cost to get them with some extra age under their belts."
wine,3a9avs,drew_fire,10,Thu Jun 18 06:36:19 2015 UTC,"Whew! Okay. Let's see here. It's been a while since I shared with you all. It's not because I've been sober....it's because the wine I've been drinking has been shit! Sucks to be me I suppose!  So here we are. I'm on a staycation in lovely San Diego. Went out to eat at this joint in La Jolla that has half price wine on Wednesday nights. Decent menu. Sommelier present. I was excited. My friend and I ordered the same dish...a braised short rib something or another with mushrooms and some other fancy stuff I have never heard of. It was tasty.  I had really been craving an older Napa Cabernet Sauvignon so we got the 07 Jarvis. We talked to the somm a bit about what was available. There were a couple of other things that were older but for the price...knowing what was a good vintage...we went with this. Before I go into details...I'm fucking hammered right now. It's 1144 pm and I'm sitting in my hotel room in my superman underoos...okay that's not true...and I'm trying to make sense of life and wine and love and everything right now. Hashtag dedicationyo. I took down a few notes since I haven't played with you all in a while. The color was a common garnet. Viscosity was a medium to medium minus. Alcohol on the nose but stronger than the number would dictate. 14.1% but smelled like a solid 15%. Definitely modeled in the old world fashion. Earthy nose. A little chocolate. A little blueberry. Some hints of herbs.  The tannic structure was decent. Medium tannins. Medium plus alcohol. Just enough complexity to make things interesting. Same notes as the nose with an added.........pungent flavor. A tartness. A bit of pencil shavings. I've noticed this before with a few other 07s. I don't know if they're too young or what. Medium minus acidity. A slight hint of tobacco before the pencil shavings. It wasn't pleasant but it wasn't good.  Finally the food arrived. Unsurprisingly, the dynamic changed. The fattiness of the braised beef melted well with the tannins of the wine. Yum! It was all kinds of yummy goodness that resonated in my mouth.  It was all shenanigans after that. I pontificated (slightly) that I knew a bit about wine and the somm wrapped a second bottle of wine in aluminum foil for me to blindly guess. I was soooo wrong.  I guessed Washington, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, 2008-2010. It was Chilean 2009 Malbec and some other Bordeaux varietals. I wasn't happy I got it wrong. I was less pleased I didn't care for the wine. She hooked it up with the price though...so I kept it to myself (until here). We drank and we drank. Started rapping to some cougars at the bar. They were a good 10+ years older but it's La Jolla...those cougars are still fine.  After all was said and done....I don't have enough game to tame the mighty cougar. I have purple teeth. I'm alone typing on a computer in some Hilton by the beach. But...I'm not going to work tomorrow....so the man can kiss my ass for the next four days!!! Tomorrow I'm planning on another special wine....standby to standby."

wine,3a9avs,ChalkyTannins,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:08:50 2015 UTC,Honestly the 07 needs about 2-3 more years but it has good potential. It definitely needs food. It's not a cocktail wine.

My girlfriend just won two awards from Law School today so we are going to celebrate with some steak dinner. I was hoping to drink this with it.   Any help is appreciated.   Cheers!

wine,3a8jr7,TheDyood,2,Thu Jun 18 03:43:52 2015 UTC,Good tips. Thank you! I am a student at UC Davis studying viticulture and enology. The department has a lot of resources for finding internships and work. I'm looking forward to actually get to work in a winery since my background is really more in agriculture and production rather than book learnin'
wine,3a8jr7,TheDyood,2,Thu Jun 18 04:35:07 2015 UTC,"And now for some actual advice. What took the longest for me was to ""synch"" the theory with the practical. Davis is known for producing lab coats, and assuming you are going to spend some time on the cellar floor,  it will be a departure from class. I would ask questions, but be sure to do so in a manner that is inquisitive, not combative. Since this is your first harvest, you may know very little. Your job will be to make sure you know the proper way to setup and sanitize equipment that is thorough and efficient. Once that's taken care of, you can worry about nutrient metabolism and tannin polymerization. Look, listen, learn. Don't argue, that's the French intern's job.  Welcome to the greatest three months of the year."
wine,3a8jr7,NorthernerWuwu,3,Thu Jun 18 05:21:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yes, I have heard how UC Davis students/alums can kind of act like know-it-alls and can rub some people the wrong way.

wine,3a8jr7,Wanderlust13,2,Thu Jun 18 06:50:41 2015 UTC,"That's really the key.  Stay humble and allow yourself to be led. Still, ask a few questions but make them poignant and topical.  Keep in mind that they see you as both cheap labor and potential allies. Most will have been where you are now and all are very political animals by nature. They'll exploit you and you should allow that. They also expect you to return the favor and you should, just never in a way that pisses them off or makes the job harder for them.

wine,3a8jr7,Le_Grand_Fromage,0,Thu Jun 18 03:18:32 2015 UTC,I'd really suggest waiting until the job starts.  In a company like Chandon (and many in Napa) the HR department will give you $150 or so as a boot stipend.
wine,3a8jr7,Le_Grand_Fromage,2,Fri Jun 19 07:52:54 2015 UTC,Not a chance. You'll get $50 gum boots.
wine,3a8jr7,Vitalstatistix,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:58:08 2015 UTC,"And a refund for any boots you buy on your own dime.   It is common practice in any medium to large size winery. I'd be surprised if Chandon didn't offer this. Steel toe boots are required ppe and employers, by law,  need to provide them. Any place with a decent HR department will tell you that up front and not make you ask.   There are countless business accounts at the red wings shop in Napa for this reason.   Perks of corporate winemaking"
wine,3a8jr7,Vitalstatistix,2,Sat Jun 20 00:56:43 2015 UTC,"Unless there's a new  California state requirement for safety toe boots, that's left up to individual company policy. I've seen permanents get a new pair of boots when new policy was put into place (after a forklift incident) but interns are either explicitly expected to show up prepared for the job in appropriate workwear or you get gummies/maybe $50 reimbursement. In two states, three countries, corporate, family owned, large, and small I've never experienced or heard through peers of casual vintage crew getting shiny new Red Wings."
wine,3a8jr7,piracer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"Steel toe has always been mandatory in US wineries under OSHA. That is why you will always get the gum boots. Some employers go a step further and offer to pick up the tab on work boots too. Not universal, but it is fairly common in Napa.   I'd feel pretty dumb showing up first day of work with new boots only to find out I can get a pair comped if needed. YMMV"

I worked at a large scale facility once where we crushed 22,000 tons in New Zealand. Crazy in terms of wine making scale (processed 750 tons in one 12 hours shift once) but it was a lot of fun. You meet tons of people from all over and pick up a few things or two from their experiences.   If its large scale try to keep some equipment yourself, not that they'll necessarily get stolen but can often times be ""borrowed"" by others (a spanner here, a fitting there).

wine,3a86r4,RatsLiveInPalmTrees,7,Thu Jun 18 00:05:39 2015 UTC,"In simple terms wine ages better with higher levels of tannin and acid as they are preservatives apparently.  I have heard elevated levels of alcohol can help ageing too, but I'm not certain if this is case or the science if it's true.    Over time, tannins will also form long chains and drop out of the wine , forming sediment and softening the texture of the wine.  You also want to make sure the wine has enough intensity (flavour).  Flavour compounds change over time, and a wine with weak dilute flavour, even if high in acid and tannin, will fall over shortly.  A wine with plenty of fruit, stores correctly, will see the fruit flavours slowly fade and secondary (or tertiary depending on your definition) flavours add complexity.  And just to make it even more confusing, some wines just age badly.  NZ Sauvignon Blanc is a good example of that.  Compare them to a good Riesling - Similar intensity of flavour and high acid.  Rieslings will generally age fantastically.  The sauv will taste like cooked peas after a few years, deterring even people who likes NZ Sauvignon to begin with."

wine,3a86r4,GahMatar,5,Thu Jun 18 03:47:30 2015 UTC,"Generally, high-sugar, high-acid, lots of tannins (possibly from oak), lots of alcohol (fortified really >= 18-20%) are signs of a wine that can age. Either in combinations or when some parameters are particularly high.  Also, packaging as an impact, high-end corks or screw caps closure can age. Low-end / synthetic corp and shitty screw caps cannot. Bags (or Boxes, which are really bags) are meant for short term use only.  All of this can be offset so some extent by how the wine is made and the trend has been to make wines as approachable in youth as possible since few people can afford to and have adequate condition to hold wines for years or decades. A lot of traditionally ""age-worthy"" wines have a reputation for not being enjoyable in their youth. As the French say, you figuratively have to chew the tannins."
wine,3a86r4,Ganzer6,3,Thu Jun 18 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"It can be a very long list.  As a very general summary, acidic whites (semillon, reisling, oaked chardonnay) and heavier reds (Cab Sauv, Shiraz) will age longer than 5 years, but it can vary on a case by case basis."

wine,3a86r4,Socrates5150,2,Thu Jun 18 11:30:48 2015 UTC,"That's a complicated question. Bordeaux varietals, i.e. Cabernet, Merlot, Cab Franc, can age longer than 5 years, but not all. Lighter wines like Pinot Noir, Gamay, Nebbiolo can also age longer than 5 years, but not every wine made from these grapes, even from the same region/producer/vintage can necessarily age that long. For White wines, Riesling, Chenin Blanc, Melon de Bourgogne (Muscadet), even Sauv Blanc in a Sauternes can age due to the acid and sugar. But that's not to say that all wines made from these grapes are worth aging as most will not develop any deeper flavors.   There is no quick guide to knowing what wines will age and develop well. Even price doesn't really mean anything. Many Muscadet whites can age for 10+ years and cost less than $20.  The only real way to know if a wine has aging potential is by tasting the wine and understanding the structure of it. Is there high tannin/acid or sugar? And just because a wine has a lot of tannin or acid it doesn't necessarily mean it will improve over time it just means it will keep for longer.   All that being said, /u/CondorKhan is right saying that 95% will simply degrade with time. Which means that if you are looking a t a wine in a shop and wondering if it i worth aging, the answer is most likely ""No."""
wine,3a86r4,dcloafer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:11:46 2015 UTC,"That whole figure of ""95% won't age well"" is true, but deceptive. 95% of wines produced, in terms of volume, are kind of crappy and are sparse in the tannin and acid department. They are designed to be drunk young and don't have the structure to age.   But dedicated wine shops usually don't stock a heck of a lot of that sort of swill. I'd say 50-80% of the bottles in my go-to wine shops have the sort of structure that would allow them to age pretty decently in the medium term at least. It's more rare to have something that will age well for 20 years, but many high-quality old-school wines will probably benefit from a few years in the bottle."
wine,3a86r4,WesStrikesBack,2,Thu Jun 18 18:52:30 2015 UTC,"The geek answer is higher pH and high dissolved oxygen at bottling.  High dissolved o2 makes wine very fruity and forward, but the wines don't age well."

wine,3a7h37,Qweniden,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:13:35 2015 UTC,"Just as with movies, wine is a matter of personal taste, I hope we agree. If a movie gets a 'thumbs up' from 95 out of 100 critics, it's probably worth watching and I'm gonna buy the DVD or a movie ticket.  I understand what you are saying about finding a producer which matches my taste preference but just as with movies no film director makes only good or only bad movies. I'd like to see overall picture when all producers are mixed up and put head to head. Maybe you find a gem.  Here's the list of top 250 movies just to illustrate what I'm looking for: http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=nv_ch_250_4    There are similar ratings/charts for books and other art.

wine,3a7h37,goats_are_orange,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"Its easier to get a real consensus with movie critics because they are so many of them.  There are very few wine critics that really ""matter"" and most them have a strong stylistic preference.  If you don't like the same kind of wine they do, the ""points"" are virtually meaningless.   Beyond that, wine tasting methodology is fraught with peril.  Its pretty ridiculous that someone can taste a wine at its evolution at one moment in time and narrow their preference consistently down to one number in a blind setting.  And speaking of ""blind"", that has its own problems.  Generally the riper, bigger wines will stand out in those situations.   But if the wines aren't blind then label bias and relationships come into play.   Most people who get serious into wine eventually come to understand the extreme folly of wine critics and wine ratings.  At best, you may find a critic who shares your palate preferences and they can turn you onto new producers,  but even then you need to learn your own palate then.  Lastly, Ive enjoyed enough poorly rated movies and vica-versa that Im not particularly impressed with movie critics either."

wine,3a2wde,agtcool,15,Wed Jun 17 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"My limited understanding: tartaric acid dissolves better in grape juice than in wine. When you turn grape juice into wine,  the tartaric acid starts to precipitate out. Some wineries chill the finished wine before bottling to force this precipitation. Some filter the wine. Regardless, the crystals are (mostly) odorless and tasteless, but go ahead and lick that cork to find out for yourself. At most they are texturally and visually unpleasant.   In the restaurant business, customers occasionally want to send back a wine when they see a cork like this. Or they'll complain about the last glass of wine from a bottle that includes these crystals. I think some people like the feeling of superiority they get from telling a waiter that he/she has not measured up. Me,  I'd rather drink the wine and enjoy the company of my dinner guests.   I don't work with a California wine list these days, but if memory serves, Grgich Hills Chardonnay used to be a bottling with the most noticeable tartrate deposits at the bottom."
wine,3a2wde,fermenter85,4,Tue Jun 16 20:50:25 2015 UTC,"Tartaric crystals occur when potassium and tartaric acid meet under certain circumstances.   Cold stabilization something that a lot of (especially old world) producers do to avoid this. You see it mostly in sparkling wines due to the strong desire to have clear and pretty wine. But those crystals do add flavor, in fact many producers feel that filtering out the crystals or stabilizing the wine takes a lot away from it.   My preferred method of dealing with them is to decant the wines that are likely to have them. Generally they're California chardonnays, which could benefit from that anyway."
wine,3a2wde,agtcool,2,Wed Jun 17 02:43:21 2015 UTC,"The wines shouldn't be going to bottle with crystals in the wine. The crystals are precipitating in bottle. There is no mechanical filtering method that prevents tartrates, the wine needs to be cold stabilized via refrigeration, altering the suspension factors of the solution via additions or technology."
wine,3a2wde,fermenter85,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:07:01 2015 UTC,"Wait what?   Cold stabilizing doesn't exactly do that. The winemaker cools a vat down to like 30 degrees and all of the crystals that can form will and they will stick to the sides of the vat and/or be filtered out.   I'm not sure where you thought I said filtering might stop the formation of crystals, but what I meant was that filtering would get rid of crystals that have already formed."
wine,3a2wde,agtcool,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:36:15 2015 UTC,"in fact many producers feel that filtering out the crystals or stabilizing the wine takes a lot away from it   You said ""filtering"", I was clarifying that the filtering itself doesn't solve the stability problem, you only filter once you've stabilized (if you do that, for us the vast majority of the tartrates settle to the bottom of the tank and we simply rack the wine off of that like lees).  I am a full time winemaker, I know how to cold stabilize, I was just clarifying your comment because there are technological solutions to cold stabilize or force precipitate, but a traditional mechanical filter is not how that's done."

wine,3a2wde,SilverWingsofMorning,2,Wed Jun 17 02:47:32 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'd change about your post is that the words ""dissolve better"" aren't accurate and betray the rest of your great comment.  A better way to say it would be that tartaric acid and potassium are more likely to precipitate after the juice has been fermented.  Cold stabilizing can also be done with natural product additions that affect the stability of the wine, though refrigeration is the typical method of cold stabilization. Use of gum arabic and other natural gums is becoming more common.  I personally like using gum arabic, it's incredibly effective, has a positive effect on mouthfeel, is a comparably minor addition (usually 0.5-1.5 ml/L or 0.05-0.1%), and saves us a couple thousand dollars of electricity running the refrigeration when we otherwise wouldn't."

What do you plan to do with it-- are you going to live there, run events, have a fractional ownership deal?  Is it a place to go and stay for a week or weekend where you could rent it out.  Way to many questions to be asked and answered before you lay out $1.5MM  I ran into some people (and the wine maker) at a wine pairing/dinner a while ago.  What was amusing is I asked them if they frequented the restaurant and they respond with -- yeah, we own it.    In the course the conversation they indicated that they bought some acreage in the wine growing region in Arizona but one of the other wineries/vineyards were actually going to deal with the grapes themselves.  Regarding AZ wines:  don't knock 'em until you try 'em."

wine,3a4id7,GahMatar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:07:24 2015 UTC,"They make sweet wines with native grapes. The winery website talks about ""2700 muscadine vines"". Muscadine is an hard-to-sell native grape. It's quite telling that most of what they have to say about their 5 wines is about the local artist who's featured on the label.  EDIT: Found news article with accurate production volume since the vineyard website did not provide enough info:   Ann and Jim Irvin in 2001 purchased property on Wadmalaw Island and planted 11 acres of muscadine grapes. Irvin-House Vineyards, which hosts a series of annual grape-related events, last year produced about 3200 cases of wine and welcomed 40,000 visitors.   3200 cases = 38400 bottles. They're selling to focus on the Distillery.  Two more things, this quote from the website of the winery:   the vineyard offers walking trails, a petting zoo, a garden, large pond, winery, Firefly distillery and gift shop.    So it's a tourist / day trip operation. If that's what you're into, that's cool but it's not going to be all glamour, though you'd end up having to smile a lot.  And the fact that prior to the current 1.5m$ listing, the same property was listed for 347k$ in 2011. The vines were initially planted in 2000 so the extra 1.15m$ did not come from either the house (built 1982) or the vineyard or winery itself..."

wine,3a6g4b,HRP,11,Wed Jun 17 16:45:44 2015 UTC,You should be looking elsewhere in your life and diet if what you're looking for are health benefits.  You know why wine provides health benefits?  Because it's fucking delicious and calms you the hell down after a stressful day.  Stress relief goes a long way towards living a healthier life.
wine,3a6g4b,GahMatar,2,Wed Jun 17 16:48:01 2015 UTC,So you are saying that wine does not provide any health benefits other than stress relief?
wine,3a6g4b,CondorKhan,6,Wed Jun 17 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"Here's a quote from the Mayo Clinic:   Red wine seems to have even more heart-healthy benefits than do other types of alcohol, but it's possible that red wine isn't any better than beer, white wine or liquor for heart health. There's still no clear evidence that red wine is better than other forms of alcohol when it comes to possible heart-healthy benefits.  Antioxidants in red wine called polyphenols may help protect the lining of blood vessels in your heart. A polyphenol called resveratrol is one substance in red wine that's gotten attention.   Notice the amount of hedging in that wording. And this bit, same source:   Some research shows that resveratrol could be linked to a reduced risk of inflammation and blood clotting, both of which can lead to heart disease. More research is needed before it's known whether resveratrol was the cause for the reduced risk. However, one study showed that resveratrol may actually reduce the positive effect of exercise on the heart in older men. It's also important to know that resveratrol's effects only last a short time after drinking red wine, so its effects may not last in the long term.   So it might not be good, or maybe it is but not if you exercise, but we can't really tell yet."

Have a look at vintages and defective return policy. http://www.lcbo.com/content/lcbo/en/corporate-pages/about/aboutourbusiness/returning-products.html You do however raise a good point when it come to how the lcbo ships products; it was my understanding that they moved products through their network ""in house"" as opposed to using a courier service. Something I'll have to look into.

wine,3a412n,goats_are_orange,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:24:49 2015 UTC,"Besides the odd bit of damage as you experienced and of course the risk of bottle shock which is true with any mode of shipping wine there's no real problem.  From Ottawa to the GTA its air freight which is in pressurized aircraft. The pilots  don't arrive dead or in pressure suits after all most modern jets are climate controlled.  The package will be sent at night picked up and sent to an air conditioned sorting center.  The postal hub is in Mississauga right near Pearson and it was a domestic package which means comes around 1-3 am - so hot days don't matter in the slightest. Why in the middle of the night? day is for passenger planes. DHL, UPS and FedEx have their hubs at or around Pearson so there are a lot of freight planes. More freight runs through Pearson each night than people during the day ;)  The massive Canada post hub is very well air-conditioned, actually they all are, so there is a reason Canada post looses so much money ;).   Canada post itself moved to many smaller trucks years ago to save fuel costs from the old boxy bread vans still used by UPS/ Fedex. What does this mean? minimal cargo room.  Packages to commercial entities get priority, personal package get shipped out with the mail. What does this mean? it's out the door by 9 am or it spends all day hanging out in the huge AC flooded sorting center. What does this mean? minimal time in truck.  When you pay for different speeds it has very little to do with actual time in transit. The difference is how much time it spends idling in an air conditioned sorting center. You pay to jump the cue that's about it.  So beyond the damage caused by sorting machines there is no real concern its about as harmful as driving home from the LCBO on a warm day.   The Canada post sorting center for the GTA is huge I suggest you go check it out. When you see it you'll understand that its mechanized because if they took their sweet time doing it manually it would take months to get anything out as a massive amount of material is shipped every single day.   Let's face it compared to the post office DHL, FEDEX and UPS are rank armatures. Canada post delivers material to nearly every residence in their region daily within the same time constrains while the ""big three"" send the occasional package ;).  Ship via post it's the best option short of driving up there and getting it yourself."

I love Montsant - if you can find them, the wines from Orto Vins are incredible - made by the former winemaker for Alvaro Palacios, all biodynamic and super elegant renditions of Montsant - they come in at like 13.5-14 abv, which is damn near unheard of.  Also Pinyolet Seleccion - mostly Garnacha with some Carinena thrown in.  Another one to seek out if you can find it (very rare) is the Raul Perez Vino de Familia from Castilla y Leon.  As far as Tempranillo, UKWineGuy gives a great rec for Lopez Heredia -I'd add Antigua Classico Reserva and the wines of David Sampedro (specifically Phinca Lali or Abejera).  Good luck!"

wine,3a1ipx,JmoneyOSH,-6,Tue Jun 23 07:10:40 2015 UTC,"The most important thing to say about a wine is that it's delicious. I sell a lot of wine and I just express a wine's relative dry/sweetness, relative texture/mouthfeel, and that it's delicious. If you can taste wine in the shop then you don't even have to say that much. You'll find yourself saying things like ""this wine speaks for itself, try it"" and then just stare at your customer until they comment on it somehow, agree firmly with whatever they say, take their money, and make them promise to come back and tell you how they liked it at home.  Few of your customers will know more about wine than you, so just say what you know. Compare wine you want to sell with wine you know because your experience is probably pretty accessible.   If a customer is considering a wine and immediately gives you the impression that he or she knows more about wine than you then you say something like ""sounds like you know what you like, I would never try to talk you out of that""   Read a few blog posts about food pairings and in your interview insist that you are great at pairing food and wine."

wine,3a1ipx,bouncy_ball,-1,Tue Jun 16 19:50:03 2015 UTC,"Now hang on a second. This is advice for someone who is new to selling wine. I have years of experience as a professional cheesemonger, and a few years in retail wine as well. I have led classes on food and wine pairings, and wine tastings. My sales are tremendous and I have never worked in a commision-based environment, only hourly rates with no tips and just an assignment to take good care of my guests and to give them honest advice.  My advice is this: don't bullshit, just focus on guiding your guests to delicious wine.  I don't see how this is terrible advice.   Maybe u/Muppet_Mower wants you to tell him or her what the wine tastes like: ""This Languedoc Syrah has a medium body, tastes like moderately ripe red plums, freshly turned garden topsoil and a bit of roasted meat with mushroom.""  I don't do that. I don't have the context and experience to do that. However, I do sell wine well by saying things like ""This Languedoc Syrah is delicious when you drink it on your porch with your best friends. Grill a pork tenderloin while you drink it""  I don't know. I'm not a Sommelier and I don't want to be. I just got lucky and turned a shitty retail/food service job into a good job as a professional cheesemonger, wine advisor, and wine brand representative.  My advice is supported by the men and women who have been my wine mentors over the past few years. People with decades of wine experience as Sommeliers, wine buyers, and entrepreneurs. I have always had an aversion to telling people what they were tasting, and my mentors supported me ethically and professionally.   That all being said, I just drank a bottle of Riserva of Montepulciano D'Abruzzo made by my friends Antonio and Amadeo at Collefrisio vineyards and winery in Chieti, I have been drunk before and could be drunk about all this."

I would pour you a sample of whatever was most relevant-to-your-interests based on what you said.  I would wait while you sniffed the tasting glass, tasted the wine inside, rolled it over your tongue and swallowed it. I would slide you a small bowl of nuts or a bit of bread and olive oil, and a glass of water. Maybe we would taste something else or maybe not.   You would buy it."

wine,3a1ipx,fddfgs,-2,Wed Jun 17 05:08:55 2015 UTC,"Okay fine. Read Windows on the World, or Wine for Dummies as much as you can before your interview and also try to memorize appelations and flavor profiles for various varietals, vintages, and regions. Regurgitate as much of this information as you can during the interview and forget that wine is an expression of not just the earth and biology, but also of people and culture. This is my advice now."
wine,3a1ipx,leonburger,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:20:18 2015 UTC,"Well the OP was asking for advice about getting a job, not how to go about selling the wine. The best thing he can do before is obviously try to brush up on general wine knowledge.  On the topic of your sales style, maybe you have a ton of charisma and can pull it off IRL, but some of the shit you were typing made me roll my eyes. If someone told me ""its good to drink on the porch with your best friend."" I'd have laughed hare enough to shoot the wine I was tasting out my nose(BTW pouring tastes is great.) That tells me fuck all about the wine, and makes me think you iust use corny lines like that on everything. I dont need detailed notes on a wine, but tell me something that will give me an idea of what to expect. Is that Languedoc Syrah more similar to a Northern Rhone or an Australian Shiraz?  I'm glad your sales methods are supported by your management. You can probably sell tons of wine, but I feel like your method is more suited to a grocery store section than a boutique wine shop that has more knowledgeable customers."

wine,3a0zwb,RoyalAristocrat,3,Tue Jun 16 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"Wherever you go, try the wines from the local grapes: if you can, visit the wineries, taste the wines and buy directly there. In small towns it's hard to find wine shops, better to buy in winery: in the cities like Venice or Florence, you'll find for sure some good retailers. Although at the beginning it could be odd, try to eat and drink what the local people eat and drink: the wines of a place always pair with the traditional local food, because in the history they've been grown up together. Pay attention that in Italy, everything can be expensive: avoid the traditional tourists places (bar, restaurant...) even if they seem to be cheaper: the general quality could be low. The cheapest wines with good value for price are the basic ones: the last vintage was not good in Italy, mainly in the North/Centre, so if it's possible, ask for 2013. In Lazio, look at wines like Castelli Romani, or Frascati, or even some unknown autochtonous grape. As for the visits in the wineries, I wrote a book about everything is good to ask, and know...the handboik of wine tourist. but unfortunately it's only in Italian language for now, does somebody know an English publisher? 😉"

A well organized overview of everything you're looking for, except specific vintages, and at a good pace in simple, direct language. Far from comprehensive and not always the most up to date but a good place to start.  The Oxford Companion to Wine is a brilliant resource. Be warned - like Wikipedia it has a way of luring you from page to page for hours on end ('just one more tangent...')

The Saltram was from my house warming, but can't remember what it tasted like - remember it being nice though!   And the grand daddy! A 2002 Bollinger La Grande Année.

wine,39zzfk,rjudd85,2,Tue Jun 16 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"There are good books recommended, but you can probably find plenty of stuff online by searching the major grape varieties.   As far as what to Google, things like what are the typical characteristics of whatever grape variety you are interested in or what are the characteristics of cabernet from Napa.   Also plenty of good YouTube videos.  One I quite like is WineAlign out of Canada where they have blind tastings with wine experts.   You get to hear the people talk about what they taste and why they think it is X wine.  But yeah, all that you see people talk about wine is important.  Varietal of grape is probably the most important, but Pinot Nair grown in California is different from Pinot Noir from Oregon.   Cabernet from Napa is different from Cabernet you get from Australia.  So check the sidebar and read some books.   Windows of the World is really nice.   Might be the best intro I have read.   The Wine Bible is much more dense, with a lot more information in it, but it can still be entry level as well (and be  better book to have around later)."

There aren't exams for you or anything like that so poke around for resources you like and find interesting.   Ultimately the knowledge will help you better define what you like, probably get more enjoyment from wines you don't love (I had a new Zealand sauv blanc recently and it is the first time I had one with the typical grassy note for that region.   I didn't love the wine, but was thrilled to run across that tasting note).   Eventually you will get better at buying wines you like blind and that is nice."

Traminette is a stronger version of Gewurztraminer (one of its parents) so very few people like it.  Marquette is decent, but it will take another 10-20 years to people to figure out where it grows best and how to vinify it.  It has a terrible problem of skyrocketing pH during malolactic.    My issue is that not everyone has to make a red wine.  If your climate doesn't allow it, I don't see why the issue has to be forced."

It's good in the same styles as Pinot Noir and pairs with the same dishes.  Some of the local wineries have made off-dry versions, and those aren't great.  La Crescent is also a promising grape.  It's made in styles from dry to icewine, and often compared to Riesling because of that, but I wouldn't say they taste similar.  They're not even related; La Crescent is bred from Muscat of Hamburg."

All are immediately nearby to Chassagne-Montrachet and produce excellent quality wines at far more reasonable prices.   For me, Burgundy can be such a crapshoot when spending top dollar that I am far happier to spend $50-100 on a bottle of Meursault and find it delicious than to drop 500 bones on a Bienvenues-Batard that though incredible, will never live up to the expectations set by its price."
wine,39x7sq,deepfriedbutter,4,Mon Jun 15 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"Are there any more affordable Chardonnays that would provide a similar experience?   As pointed out already, look for Premier Cru wines in Puligny-Montrachet and Chassagne-Montrachet.  The nearby 'Les Pucelles' (the virgins) still ties into the mythology surrounding the Mont Rachet hill and will give you options in the sub $100 price range.  Puligny-Montrachet Le Cailleret is also particularly good.  However, if dropping $75 on a bottle of wine is still above your pay grade, I would look to Saint-Aubin which occupies the valley on the opposite side of the Mont Rachet hill.  Though nowhere near as prestigious as its very close neighbors, the vineyards in the Saint-Aubin En Remilly Premier Cru designation are blessed with a similar soil composition to Montrachet, and will provide more than whisper of the area's greatest wines.  There are plenty of options here in the in the mid-$20s to $50 range."

Grand Cru is considered the best of the best because over time, has gained and maintained consistent excellence of production. Many producers have access to this vineyard, but it all comes down to soil, climate, terroir, and how well the grapes shine there. It's a special place that has made wine for hundreds of years.

Although I must admit that I think Jancis Robinson was rather spot-on about this wine (http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/rafael-palacios-as-sortes-2011-valdeorras) - however, it's not Chardonnay so it might not help your question."

wine,39x33u,pbrooks19,4,Mon Jun 15 14:39:54 2015 UTC,"I unfortunately didn't take a great picture of either wine as they were both had amidst other wines and with food.  NV Louis de Grenelle Saumur Corail Rosé  100% Cabernet Franc  Clear Pale rosy pink color. Delicate aromas of red berries and a faint herbal note. Light fizz made up of smaller bubbles which I liked because I didn't feel like I was frothing at the mouth when taking sips. Very smooth mousse, more strawberries, and good acidity in the mouth.  I had this at a Sichuan restaurant and it worked well with all but the spiciest dish, though I think I prefer something with a bit more acid and citrus for this type of food(I usually have Riesling or Chenin Blanc).  For $20-21 this is something I would certainly buy again as it was  a pleasure to drink. There was no noticeable flaw, though it wasn't terribly complex.  2012 Château Rives-Blanques Blanquette de Limoux Brut  90% Mauzac - 10% Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc  Light straw color, maybe just off-clear. Super freshing nose of white flowers and pears. The palate seemed to have more apple than pear, with delicate bubbles.   Had with some cheeses, and it played well with a triple cream. For $17, I will certainly buy this again.  Just a note on the Blanquette de Limoux AOC- It is considered to be the oldest sparkling wine producing region. It differs from the more recent Cremant de Limoux AOC by requiring a much higher percentage of Mauzac. ""It has the lowest permitted maximum yield of any sparkling wine in France, and is made exclusively from hand-harvested grapes. Whole, unblemished grapes are pressed within two hours of harvesting.""   Edit: I had a Cremant d'Alsace a month or two ago I can post notes for if anyone is interested and nobody else has one this month."

Taste: strong acidity, delicate bubbles, very dry with a slate like minerality. Dry orange and lemon are the primary fruits, with some almond. I know this wine has seen oak, and that makes a real difference, even if the barrels have seen plenty of prior use. A really nice value for a step up from a nv cremant. I really like this, it's unapologetically not champagne, and I like that difference.  Bailly Lapierre Crémant de Bourgogne Brut Pinot Noir NV  See: Golden color, large bubbles in a steady stream.  Smell: raspberry and apple really stand out, but it also has a nice creamy funk as well.  Taste:On the palette the apple follows through with strawberry and almond. not as complex as the vintage, but much more fruit.

Taste: Tastes very dry, larger bubbles, strong mouthwatering acidity. Tastes like, green apple, lemon peel, raspberry, hibiscus and grapefruit.   Verdict: I like this one, in the same way i like most prosecco. It is easy to drink and enjoyable on its own. it is very floral, and is very much the polar opposite of yeasty/bready champagne."

Taking a sip, the wine seemed to spontaneously erupt into bubbles on my tongue, filling my mouth with an explosion of strawberries and cream giving way to raspberries on the finish with a very faint, bitter, herbal note. Good acid and probably better with food.   I think this sells for under $20, and is definitely worth picking up. It does nothing incredible, but what it does is done well.

First off, I have to say again that I'm not a fan of champagne, so I wasn't looking forward to sampling a Crémant. Nonetheless I am committed to our Challenge and expanding my wine horizons, so while in Atlanta this past weekend I booked it to Total Wine and found this Crémant d'Alsace.   Upon initial examination, the color is straw yellow, and the wine itself has a light but pleasant viscosity. Primary aromas include white florals, like lilies, and light citrus fruits.  The varietal used is a Pinot Blanc, and the flavors definitely come through here. The taste is very fresh and juicy - strangely enough for a brut. Again we have the light citrus - particularly grapefruit - but also some crispness from the dryness. There was an interesting balance of slate and fruit.  But, Crémant is all about the fizz, and this Anne de K is full of the anticipated mousse. The bubbles really made this a lively wine, and I have to say I was intrigued by it.   I paid $18 for the bottle, and was surprised to really enjoy it. It would be perfect for a romantic picnic or luncheon - especially for girly folk such as myself.

I don't know if I've ever had a champagne that wasn't really, really dry, and I've had a few that were pretty limp by sparkling standards.

If you'd like to try one, Moët & Chandon Nectar Imperial is a demi-sec Champagne and is pretty generally available."

Pierre Sparr Cremant d'Alsace Brut Reserve  APPEARANCE  Pale yellow, highly effervescent.  NOSE  Bread dough is the first note i get right off the bat.  Under the yeasty bread scent, there is a crisp clean mineral scent with hints of apricot and honey.  TASTE  Very dry!  I was expecting it to be a lot sweeter than it was, as I was expecting some Riesling in this, but this is 100% Pinot Blanc.  There is a slight sweetness when you initially sip the wine, but that quickly gives way to a crisp, clean acidity on the finish.  A slight lemon taste on the finish.    OVERALL  Surprising!  It was no where near as sweet as I thought it would be, especially compared to other Alsatian wines I’ve tried in the past.  At only $20 per bottle, I wouldn’t hesitate to pick it up again!"

The wine is highly acidic, more so than the other two Cremants I tried for the month.  The wine uses chardonnay from around the Burgundy region including the Maconais and Chablis.  I can taste the minerals in the wine.  OVERALL  Much different than the other two i tried this month.  I wish I was able to sample other cremants, but i suppose I was lucky to find these.  Of the three, I think this was my least favorite.  Its tasty, but i like my sparkling wine to be sparkling!  I found this one to go flat in the glass very easily.

Nice nose of apple, pear, a bit honeyed, some funky Chenin verve too. The palate is where this really shines as the acidity this wine once had has mellowed and rounded off while the texture is getting supple, with some appealing yeastiness, even biscuity, chalky, lemon mineral water.

wine,39zpb5,Edgarallenbroo,5,Tue Jun 16 02:25:14 2015 UTC,"To me it's a fairly pedestrian list. Not bad for a first time.  My notes:   A lot of national/grocery type brands (Hess, Bonterra, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Barton & Guestier, Banfi, Newton, Avalon, etc) - all those familiar brands don't show creativity or value to me. Only two sparklers by the glass, and they're both from the same appellation AND winery? I get limiting the options to prevent spoilage, but a little diversity would be nice. Casteller is a fine Cava house, so I'd drop one placement and find a cool replacement. Kudos on including an interesting producer like Sean Thackrey and Janasse.  As /u/madkent said, Languedoc and Bordeaux are not the same place. The more I look at it, the more grocery brands I see. Depending on the ambitions of the restaurant that may or may not be the proper direction. Most of your wines are ""brands"" that are tied to liquor suppliers, and thus, liquor discounts on major ""brands"", which I understand (and cannot stand). The somms of Chicago and other major markets would not be impressed with this list.   My advice, if you want it, is to start tasting with your smaller distributor partners. Get past the big 2 (or 3) and start looking at wines that are not controlled by a multinational conglomerate supplier."

I know it is your first one (and you have asked for feedback)- The list looks like it was put together by someone who does not know a lot about wine. There a tons of errors (regional, spelling, placement, pricing).  The list is mostly blah stuff. Is it all from one supplier?   Im moving to Chicago in a few weeks and was wondering if anyone in the industry was looking for someone to do this type of work   I would not use this list to seek employment.

wine,39zpb5,dirtysouthwine,2,Tue Jun 16 22:43:31 2015 UTC,"It's hard to assess the quality of this list because wine availability is relative.  I wouldn't think much of this list here in San Francisco, but I've travelled to plenty of places where this would be an excellent selection (I'm looking at you, Nashville).  A few random comments:  1) I see plenty of generic picks that I personally don't find exciting - Norton Privada, Prisoner, Caymus, Cakebread, Montes Alpha - I'm not saying these are bad wines, simply that this is what you find here at, say, Costco or BevMo.  2) I like the inclusion of the Two Messengers and the Au Bon Climat.  The Realm and the Pahlmeyer are excellent selections and prices, while on the higher end, are reasonable prices versus retail.  (Note - It looks to me like your prices range significantly from 1.5x retail to 3x retail.)  3)  The Meiomi.  How do I put this?  I think it's awful.  But, I know that some (many) people enjoy it.  To me its overly sweet and syrupy and has more in common with an Aussie Shiraz than a CA pinot.  I wouldn't put it on my list but I can also see it selling well - in part because I think it appeals to wine drinkers with more limited experience.  4) It's ""Beaucastel""  (Nice choice, btw)"

Other than this there are a few very interesting wines on here and, as others have said, some uninspired ones. That being said, the ones I find uninspired are no doubt wines that will sell themselves by virtue of being big ""brands"" and there is always a balance to be found between carrying interesting hand sells and wines that need no help moving.  I would definitely switch one of your bubbles by the glass options so they aren't both Cava. Also, you might want to add a grower champagne to your list of big houses and maybe a cremant of some sort (great by the glass option).  Also, as /u/oonniioonn said it is odd there are no French wines by the glass."

wine,39v7zz,AlviseFalier,3,Mon Jun 15 18:06:10 2015 UTC,"Organization is most important to me. I'm most comfortable with geographic organization for imports and grape variety organization for U.S. wines. I'm cool with separate sections for sparkling wines and for dessert wines. I feel no burning need to separate California from Oregon, Washington, etc. I know that Malbec comes from Cahors and Mendoza, and that these days Pinot Noir can come from almost anywhere.   The other thing I look for is whether the whole store is kept cool. If I walk into a wine shop and it feels warm, I turn around and walk out. The master of temp control is Greg Moore: His Moore Bros. stores are kept at 55 degrees F, and you'll be offered something warm to wear while shopping if you ask.   Cleanliness counts, too. I used to wash the glass doors on the cold boxes every day, and any retailer who doesn't is suspect to me.  Almost forgot: Employees should have something they wear that identifies them as employees. A name tag. Something. Customers shouldn't have to ask ""Do you work here?"""
wine,39v7zz,winemule,4,Mon Jun 15 20:14:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like I might not be the best person to answer this question as I actually own a wine store and have a vested interest in the question, but here's what I attempt to achieve in mine...   Sensible/logical arrangement of stock - all Shiraz/Syrah in one section, then Shiraz/Syrah blends, then Shiraz/Grenache blends, then Grenache blends, then straight Grenache; all Italian or Spanish varietals/wines together, etc etc... (I do arrange beers by brewery though and not by style, which just appeals to me more) I like attaching tasting notes and that sort of thing to favourite bottles as well, like so. Sort of makes everything feel more personal and warm, which is defs what I aim for. Layout is simple and easy - whites and sparkling on one set of shelves, reds on another, beer and cider on another. Our only problem with organisation is that we don't have a great deal of fridge space; we've got one of everything needing chilling in fridges scattered around the shop so customers usually look at the shelves and then ask us to find a chilled version for them. Staff-wise, it's just me and my biz partner... We're both friendly and chilled out but we know our shit. We don't upsell or harass people; we're happy to let them know we're here if they need us and hang back until they do. We also don't have uniforms or anything. We're a casual little store. We're chatty and cheeky, though, and 99.9% of the time, customers respond really well to what we do. (The odd person who doesn't like it is usually someone who's a bit confused, like the guy a few years ago who read 'New - Mountain Goat Brewery Red IPA' on our sandwich board and came in demanding to know how much we were selling the ""goat milk"" for...) Music - haha... I'm a bit of a folk/country fiend so that's generally what plays here. Nothing too loud or offensive, for the most part. And my BP loves Elvis and Chuck Berry and the like, so they get a good guernsey too. We get a lot of comments on the music, actually. Probably because we are giant hipsters with a hipster shop in a hipster neighbourhood...   In all of that, the most important thing for me in my own store and when I poke around in other stores is the staff, though. You can have the most amazing range in the most beautiful store, but if you're served by an asshole, it makes you less inclined to go back there. I guess in general, what WE aim for is warmth, amiability, really good product knowledge, and ease of experience for our customers. I have a Master of Wine and Wine Appreciation and have worked in the wine industry for most of my adult life, but I try really hard not to be a wanker. Like I want people to enjoy what they buy from me, and not feel judged for their tastes or their budget (which is why the range starts at around $8 - pretty cheap here in Aus - and ends at $100+), and strive to put people at ease. I think it works, for the most part. But there's always room for improvement..."
wine,39v7zz,excessiongirl,2,Mon Jun 15 07:56:30 2015 UTC,Your sensible/logical arrangement sounds similar as to how my store is set up however if your Italian and Spanish wines are separate than your Grenache where do you put Garnacha?   My store is a bit different as we separate via region not varietal. Just curious
wine,39v7zz,Ranger_Rose,5,Mon Jun 15 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"Traditionally, it makes sense to separate by region - Old World wine stores still do so. Many U.S. stores do so as well.  I think however in 2015 in the U.S. that separation doesn't make sense anymore given the way consumers shop for wine, especially millenials.  Putting your Argentinian Malbecs and your Cahors wine in separate areas of the store would for instance IMHO be a big mistake. First of all because many Malbec fans wouldn't think of a somewhat pricier French Malbec - whereas if it's right there next to the South American wines they will go for it - and second because most consumers still shop by varietal.  I might do special sections for Burgundies and red Bordeaux, but I would definitely mix my Pinot grigios or Sauv blancs or Rhône varietals - regardless of region - together.  Of course it all depends on your local market. If your consumers are old-fashioned wine connoisseurs who know everything there is to know about Rioja and Pomerol, then organizing by region makes sense.  But if it's a bit more mainstream and young, I would forego the breakdown by region in most cases. But in that case I would obviously have shelf talkers for every wine."
wine,39v7zz,arnaudh,2,Mon Jun 15 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I operate. For example, there's a lot of Grenache in Australia, lots of people like it but so they're more likely to spend an extra $5 on a CdR they've not seen before if it's sitting in with a bunch of wines they do know and like.   Also, the labelling laws here are obviously very different to the AOC laws and the like, so if someone has no clue what a Vouvray is but the recipe they're cooking tonight recommends one to go with the meal, and they walk in and see Vouvray with my other Chenin Blancs, that question is answered for them immediately, ya know?"
wine,39v7zz,excessiongirl,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:16:18 2015 UTC,The Malbec example is me. I'm newer to wine and want to see all my options. Wandering across four large aisles to compare prices and tasting notes of one type of wine is not the way I prefer to shop. I like the type together. If it's subdivided by country from there so be it.  I also ended up loving a French Malbec!
wine,39v7zz,Dances_With_Cheese,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:35:48 2015 UTC,"For Old World, in many cases organising by region almost is organising by varietal. The various AOC laws nearly all specify certain (combinations of) grapes to be used. It's certainly nice for the less-informed buyer if you add that information somehow though, especially since  Bordeaux and Champagne for instance allow a number of grapes to be used but don't mandate they all be used.  And if it's not because of AOC laws, it's just that in certain regions they mostly grow certain grapes. It's hard to find anything other than Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier in the Champagne region for instance, and the other way around you'll find Altesse pretty much only in Savoie and Bugey (which neighbours Savoie).   In any case, to me as a European primarily Old World buyer, organising Old World wines by region makes more sense than by varietal. For New World that doesn't quite hold though. A smaller store could just get away by organising entirely by country and colour though rather than anything more specific."

wine,39v7zz,excessiongirl,2,Mon Jun 15 22:06:35 2015 UTC,"When buying, not very important.   When tasting I prefer someplace nice and quiet with friendly staff who are willing to talk about the wines for a few hours.

wine,39v7zz,Dances_With_Cheese,2,Mon Jun 15 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"We generally each buy 2-3 bottles of our favorites that are pricier, and a case or two of everyday wine. So not a whole lot, but we don't just eat, drink and leave. We also don't bring food to anyplace that serves it's own food obviously, and we always bring enough to share with the wine steward and the people around us.

wine,39v7zz,Dances_With_Cheese,2,Mon Jun 15 20:28:04 2015 UTC,"Really one of the most important things for me is what the store stocks. I like going to a store where the manager has picked the selection himself, where I can talk to the staff about the different wines, etc. It goes with the knowledge I imagine.  I'm lucky enough that I live in a wine making region, so most of the wine stores in my area have actual bonds with the producers most of the time.   I will say, though, that I like it if the store has an identity.

wine,39v7zz,jfp51,2,Mon Jun 15 14:23:02 2015 UTC,"Layout: Ideally case displays up front which should rotate, look fresh and be decked accordingly with POS. Standing shelving preferably 3-5 high with room for overstock on top. Shelves should be kept full, bottles show no dust and are categorized appropriately. I prefer and suggest California to be laid out by varietal and the rest done by region (Spain/Portugal/France/Italy/Australia/Germany.) Try and keep all bordeaux's, rhones, riojas together.   Bargain rack: I've seen Great & Under 8 racks located in the back of the store listing all rated wine within a price category. These are ridiculously good for offloading wine.  Decor: Don't be cold and antiseptic, make the store warm and inviting.  Music: Classic rock works well, soft percussion even. (STAY FAR AWAY FROM TODAY'S HITS.)  Associate's Attire: Matching polos displaying store name, name tags for associates optional. Jeans & shorts, lugging cases in and out of the warehouse can be a dog for floor peons so you want them to be comfortable and cool (I had regularly restocked 80-100 cases on a typical 8-hour shift.)  Employees are your GREATEST ASSET as a legitimate store. Have intelligent, well-spoken individuals with a good work ethic. College students work incredibly well for this and OFTEN find that they want to get into the distributor-side of things. You can teach wine knowledge but, you cannot teach hard-work.   Other notes: Every customer should be greeted by on-floor employees, a simple ""Hello"" or ""Can I help you find anything today"" makes all the difference. Employees should be attentive and willing to help and if they don't know the answer, they need to admit that and refer the customer to another employee that does."

The craft beer movement has done a lot to create this. With more interesting, explorable beer out there, wine people are taking notice and choosing to see what it's about. And as the craft beer crowd continues to expand their palates with more interesting and expressive beer, wine becomes something that's not so foreign a concept.  Granted, maybe I live in a weird circle, but I'm watching it happen. Beer guys drinking and exploring wine more often and vice versa.....spirits too. So if people are exploring across the drinking spectrum, why wouldn't apps across the spectrum work as well.  With all that being said, do I think and Untappd wine app would be as popular as Untappd, no I don't. Which is probably what you're whole point was, at which point I just made this whole response pointless. LOL"
wine,39rp30,Terza_Rima,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:19:40 2015 UTC,Vivino is good - I like how you can scan the front label but i think the reviews seem to be pretty unhelpful most of the time.

wine,39q7rf,guyleedon,2,Sat Jun 13 18:11:28 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty neat!  Did you notice any particulars blends/varietals/styles that seemed predominant, either in volume or at least in quality of product?"
wine,39q7rf,theultrayik,2,Sat Jun 13 18:39:10 2015 UTC,"Volume - varieties: there was a lot of Riesling (Czech and German varieties), Gruner Veltliner, Pinot Noir and Frankova (Blaufrankisch). Muller-Thergau also had a decent showing.  Volume - blends: Almost all of the wines were single variety. Exceptions to this were sparkling, which was often Champagne blends (possible with Pinot Gris / Blanc).  Volume - styles: off-dry to moderate-sweet whites dominated. There was little truly dry white, and the reds seemed around 1/3 to 1/4 of production. As mentioned above orange / amphora wines were (relatively) common.  Quality: This gets trickier, as, frankly, a lot of the wine didn't seem that great. I'm also personally not the biggest fan of slightly sweet whites, which didn't do my notes and favours.  I'd say that the most consistently good wine was the sweet desert wines (made from a variety of grapes, including Muskat Moravia and Sauv Blanc). Perhaps 1/3 of the producers had one, and they were all quite tasty and had enough acidity to not make it sickly sweet.  Apart from that the Pinot Noir and St. Laurent seemed to have a degree of consistency toward nice wine. The white varieties were too inconsistent all around for me to make recommendations."
wine,39q7rf,I_See_Wrong_People,2,Sun Jun 14 07:49:26 2015 UTC,Did you notice any international or foreign wine press around? I'm curious as to how these Eastern European wines are being received internationally.
wine,39qib9,DarehMeyod,14,Sat Jun 13 19:43:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Try a full bodied Chardonnay. Something with a lot of butter and toasty oak. I normally shy away from this style, but it will taste good with a fatty ribeye."

wine,39qib9,theultrayik,6,Sat Jun 13 21:59:17 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy mentioned, oaked chardonnay would do the trick.  Also, if it's a ribeye, something with strong acid would cut through the fat (although I would avoid sweet or herbal flavors).  I would be remiss if I didn't also mention sparkling wine and roses, both of which are super food-friendly."

wine,39qib9,square_mile,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:07:16 2015 UTC,"I can't say I've tried a heavily oaked Chardonnay with a steak before, mostly because I cant stand that style, but I still can't imagine it being a great pairing.  For a steak, especially a ribeye, I would go for a dry rose. These are really refreshing and have good acidity which help it stand up to the fatty meat. You can get very high quality examples for $20-30. Any decent wine shop near you can help you select one that will work.  Alternatively, you can look at sparkling wines with good acid. Sparkling Gruner Veltliner, Chenin Blanc, or a sparkling rose would be good I think."
wine,39qib9,Wormsy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:28:08 2015 UTC,"A premium Viognier or Chenin could also work, but as mentioned the most important thing would be a huge amount of oak treatment."

wine,39qib9,petit_cochon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:37:34 2015 UTC,Several. Before I can go any further and recommend a specific wine and region for that wine I need a few answers from you  What cut of beef is the steak in question? what else will be in the meal? do you leave on the fat? lean or marbled meat? and most importantly how exactly will you be preparing it?   If you want something general yeah there's Riesling but don't overlook a good Gewürztraminer especially if you like a little spice on your steak ;). I wouldn't chose one from Alsace as those tend to be on the sweeter side but something from Germany proper.
wine,39qib9,goats_are_orange,2,Sun Jun 14 02:34:11 2015 UTC,"OP mentioned that it's a ribeye, so I'm assuming a fair bit of fat as that's typical of that cut."

Here are a few — all wines available in the US for under $300 and drinking beautifully today:  98pt Cellartracker, 100pt Parker from a great vintage (and my choice!): 2007 Pierre Usseglio Reserve des Deux Freres Châteauneuf-du-Pape  If you're after huge amounts of age you can try this 68 year old Barolo. I've had the 1952 and it's still kicking. I believe the 1947's are supposed to be holding up even better: 1947 Borgogno Barolo Riserva  If you're after Napa Cab try: 1991 Dominus Estate, by the esteemed Christian Moueix  If you want a white wine that will make you permanently rethink white wine try: 2012 Aubert Chardonnay Lauren Vineyard  And, if you want the wine that the French government calls the best wine in the world (note: it's a sweet/dessert wine): 1988 d'Yquem, Sauternes (375ml half bottle)  And, if you want to wait 10 years try: 2010 Casanova di Neri Tenuta Nuova Brunello di Montalcino  This is supposedly the vine of the vintage, from the best Brunello di Montalcino vintage in history. 100pt Parker, 99pt Suckling. Some bottles have hit the U.S. but I'm still waiting on mine. The brave few who have committed infanticide on Cellartracker have averaged out to 97+ points but it needs a decade in the bottle to blow your mind. if you open now decant at least 6 hours.  99 pt on Cellartracker from a great vintage: 2010 Poderi Aldo Conterno Barolo Romirasco The tasting notes on this may have tricked me into thinking this was approachable now with tons of decanting.

wine,39kxh9,winemule,2,Fri Jun 12 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"The obligatory back-label hype is to be expected. But the ingredient list seems very straightforward:  ""Ingredients: 35% Grenache, 18% Mourvedre, 16% Grenache blanc, 12.5% Roussanne, 8% Carignane, 8% Cinsault, 1.5% Marsanne, 1% Counoise grapes, tartaric acid and sulfur dioxide. In the winemaking process, the following were utilized: Indigenous yeast, yeast nutrients and bentonite. At the time of bottling, this product contained 60 ppm total SO2 and 25 ppm free SO2."""
wine,39kxh9,arnaudh,2,Fri Jun 12 13:21:42 2015 UTC,"This is where it becomes tricky for many smaller wineries. Since this data - if we believe its phrasing - was collected at the time of bottling, it means that they affixed the back labels a while back after bottling. That means added costs.  Consumers might need to pay a bit more to see this kind of information generalized to all American-made wine.  EDIT: nevermind - ingredients list is not mandated, so no COLA approval needed."
wine,39kxh9,youngchunk,2,Fri Jun 12 20:51:22 2015 UTC,"At most production facilities, free sulfur and total sulfur numbers are tested literally the same day that the wine is bottled and labeled. It all happens in one big go. I'm not sure what you mean by affixing the back label after the wine had been bottled. The back labels are affixed to the wine bottle the same day the wine goes in the bottle, which is also the same day the wine was tested for free sulfur and total sulfur. It is also tested for CO2, alcohol, dissolved oxygen and temperature.   Edit: If the winemaker is having this wine bottled at a facility, they basically give instructions to the facility on how to manipulate the wine before its labeled so that the information on the already approved label is not false. The wine is held at the facility for some time, sulfur numbers are adjusted to the right number on the label just before bottling, and the labels are affixed all in one go."
wine,39kxh9,arnaudh,2,Sat Jun 13 04:10:31 2015 UTC,"You know what - forget what I said. I just realized that since the ingredients list is not mandated, the back label doesn't need to be sent to obtain COLA approval (which usually takes about 25 days) even if for the following vintage the list changes."
wine,39kxh9,arnaudh,2,Sat Jun 13 05:37:25 2015 UTC,"I just realized that this wouldn't be a problem. The ingredients list (as presented here, or the kind Ridge Vineyards also uses) is not mandated, so no need to send for COLA approval in case you wanted to change it, even if the list or some numbers were different in a subsequent vintage. You probably don't even need to get COLA approval if this is a new vintage of an existing wine that you just added an ingredients list to."
wine,39kxh9,NOLAWinosaur,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:50:39 2015 UTC,"The labels must be approved by the government through the TTB before affixing to bottles. That takes a lot of time, and adds cost."

wine,39kxh9,domestic_dog,2,Fri Jun 12 16:56:49 2015 UTC,It's pretty straight forward in that it is a fairly common practice. There are a variety of reasons for which you would need to add tartaric acid.

wine,39kxh9,pipocaQuemada,3,Fri Jun 12 14:29:30 2015 UTC,"That is the main reason. Would you rather put out a subpar wine that people wont like and buy, tarnishing your brand for the future, or just add some acid to balance the wine?  Controlling pH is another concern. You need your pH to be below a certain threshold for sterility and stability. Would you rather have a significant portion of your wines arrive to the consumer flawed, or add some acid?  Sometimes, you just don't get the acid you need in the grapes. This can be due to weather mostly, which can affect picking decisions."

It is the tin-foil-hat meets the-Earth-is-6k-years-old and jet-fuel-can't-melt-steel-beams with the addition of burying horns filled with dung at the right time and in the right place can make your wine taste better. It's nuts.  Now, that said, many people that embrace this odd philosophy do make great wine and largely because all of the trappings still have at their core a respect and love of the land. It's a totally misplaced and insane way to express that love but they also tend to be the same people that have excellent land management and extreme levels of attention to their grapes. The effect isn't due to biodynamics at all but I look at their wines with interest. I don't believe in crystals or mystic energies but I do trust hippies to grow good weed.  Organic?

So in practice, most online liquor stores are run out of regular stores rather than being huge box-mover warehouse-type operations.   At the same time, it's perfectly fine to order wine online from outside the country, but since that is typically a lot more expensive (shipping charges and of course duties added when from outside the EU), not many people do it.

wine,39kygg,jjstunner11,3,Fri Jun 12 13:28:57 2015 UTC,"Shipping wine is expensive because it's heavy, delicate and temperature sensitive.  My advice would be to acquire some wine shippers (the cardboard boxes w/ styrofoam inserts that hold a case of wine) and ship them using UPS 3-day select when the weather is right, which may require waiting until the Fall.  In my experience, 3 day select is your best tradeoff between speed and cost.  It will travel by air for the long haul which is critical.  Note - You'll have to also check the legality of shipping wine between various states - it is not legal in many instances, though you can choose not to disclose what you're shipping."

The west side has higher elevation and cools off more at night. The east side gets some great heat and is a little drier. The wines follow accordingly.  On the west I love Halter Ranch, Minnasian Young (big, ripe zin), Opolo, and Justin. They're closer to the coast than the east side. It's a pretty drive up 41 from morro bay.  If you venture to the ready side I like Sarzotti and Cass. But the east side is further from the cost. There is some great food in the Paso square, just yelp whatever looks good to you. Justin also has a nice restaurant if you time it to be there at lunch. I recommend planning out the drive since some of the wineries (Justin especially) is far out. Have a great day!

Wine is like art - completely subjective in terms of preference but there are guiding principles, that when applied, lead to a more positive result.   For example drinking a white wine that is warm.  It won't kill you but you are not experiencing the wine in it's ideal form.   I say don't get caught up in rules but applying some basic knowledge leads to more enjoyable wine drinking experiences."

On the other hand it is possible that the wine is wanted because it's all some people may feel comfortable drinking, because they don't know much else. I don't know a lot about scotch, don't drink it much, but I know I like Dalwhinnie. Am I wrong? Are there others I'd enjoy? Probably. Certainly. But I don't involve myself with Scotch the way I involve myself with wine. It's just not that important to me. For a lot of people, especially in the United States where an alarming proportion of the adult population doesn't drink any alcoholic stuff at all, that is probably the case. It's not that they're wrong, or uninformed, it's just not part of their world."

wine,39hyvv,funmobile,2,Fri Jun 12 01:57:21 2015 UTC,"Of course there are wrong answers.  Taste isn't subjective at all it's biological. Since it is biological it can be categorized, examined and quantified. The problem is you're thinking in a simple yes or no binary so you throw your arms up and say ""its subjective"". There are a plethora of wrong answers just as there are a plethora of right answers. The problem is your scope is too narrow.   You are unlikely to do what is required to give the definitive answer therefore you have to use what's in front of you ie your experience and observations and then play the odds.    What do I mean?   Well I doubt you'll do a detailed genetic analysis of the person to check if they are receptive to certain compounds and a detailed analysis of both their medical records and hair, bone, blood and tooth matter. So you have to use your sense and reason to determine what the wrong answer is for this person. A bit of knowledge of human of human biology would be a help.  Take a good hard look at the person, ask a few questions and then think.  What will that do?  give you datapoints of course  Ask them what they usually eat, if they prefer coffee or tea and how they take it. What beverages they like. Take note if they're male or female as females have stronger noses therefore can easily taste more nuanced flavour profiles.  These all are sign posts which rule out certain wines  Tea and coffee compounds which are in wine coffee. These compounds are found in many wines.  If they like coffee over tea then you can rule out a large swath of reds as unappealing especially old vine zinfandel. Coffee drinking habbits can tell you about the level of toast a person finds appealing, the  darker the roast means a higher char as both are carbon.  Ask them about cheese why? SALT levels. Side note: Avoid mixing Riesling and Saint Andre's or a similar triple cream cheese the result is putrid sulfur and notes of rotten mule anus.  Ask them about what types of fruit they like. If someone hates raspberries  they will not like a wine with those notes.  Ask how they take their tea/coffee.   If they douse everything with sugar well they've infantilized their taste buds so a dry wine would be the wrong answer. If they're addicted to soda forget anything dry they've destroyed their tastebuds.  What a person eats affects their sense of taste so ask them about their favorite foods. A person with a high sodium diet will not have nuanced taste therefore they will not like a great deal of wine. Most people live off packaged food which is loaded with salt ;)    An older person will usually prefer a dryer product to a younger person why? our sensitivity to sugar tastes is supposed to diminish. Look at their physical condition to determine if they have properly developed taste buds.  Do they smoke? or live with smokers? there taste buds are shot or at least crippled.  Are they male or female? females have a more sensitive sense of smell therefore they will note more delicate flavors in wines as the majority of your sense of taste comes from your sense of smell.  Of course there are right and wrong answers.  A person who says its subjective isn't paying close enough attention.   Are you gathering data? asking questions?   No? then how do you expect to get any answers? All you're doing is spouting wines that appeal to your physical condition, genetic makeup and diet.  Why do people say taste is subjective? its a hell of a lot easier.  You may never find the right answer but you'll find a shit load of wrong ones to rule out."

You'll eventually take Dr. Bondada's viticulture class and he's a hoot, loves to help out students in getting placements though his exams are ridiculously long. Not hard, just... unnecessarily long.   You''ll also most likely take wine microbiology with Dr. Edwards, great instructor but tough class. He's got a few contacts here and there that might be able to help.   I understand that a lot of those kids do either minimal credit load, or just part time studies during vintage.   That being said, I've been disappointed by a lot of the wines in that area although Barnard Griffin makes a really good rsv merlot that is probably one of the most interesting wines from WA ive had.  Most of the really good stuff comes from Walla Walla so definitely go down there to check it out."
wine,39hkzx,lyrelyrebird,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:59:33 2015 UTC,I brought back a bottle of Barnard Griffin's rsv cab and loved it. Met a couple of the students up there and actually sat in on a class.

But if your girlfriend's father really does know what's what about wine, this will impress him:  For under $100 you can get a bottle of Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle Champagne. It is a great value, thanks to the prejudices of those who see vintage Champagne as the only reliable hallmark of quality. Grand Siecle is made from three different vintages; 94 points from the Spectator. Until 2008, hardly any came into the US, and when it did it was more than $200/bottle!

wine,39cyza,HornetAttack,2,Thu Jun 11 06:27:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I think that Raveneau 1er is probably more widely available than the other two - at least what's what a winesearcher search tells me - so I'm not sure how attainable they are if Raveneau is out of reach. On the whole, I think the key is to stick with quality producers. Boillot, Ramonet, Leflaive, Niellon, PYCM and their ilk are pretty safe bets, although I would definitely read the applicable CT notes before buying as a lot of 1ers can be pretty variable vintage to vintage. As far as specifics go, the higher end PYCM 1ers come to mind (e.g. Perrieres or Charmes). If you want to go a bit crazier maybe go for a nice Roulot 1er. If you want to get really crazy and don't mind blowing your budget by a multiple of 2 or 3, you could go for a Coche 1er. Hell, you could go for a Coche village and possibly give the other bottles a run for their money.   Also, do you know what Monty you're buying?"

However, my friends just had the '04 last weekend and said it was outstanding. 2010 is a great vintage, so I imagine it will show well too, although given its youth it probably will require a substantial decant. Very nice re the Raveneau! Whether you bring it to the Monty dinner or buy it for your cellar, I definitely recommend it."

Visited last week and has a phenomenal time believe they have a tour each day around 5pm or so but you would have to check.  Also if you make it down to Beaujolais please visit Chateux des Jacques (owned again by Jadot) the wine there was stunning somewhere between cote de nuits Pinot and northern Rhone Syrah - certainly not what I expected,  also the scenery in Beaujolais is fantastic"

Bouchard Père et Fils (don't confuse with Bouchard Ainé et Fils). The tour of their cellar is great, and they have the monopoly on ""Vigne de l'enfant Jesus"", which is one of my favorite wines ever.  In Morey-saint-denis there is a great Cave de Vigneron (selling wine from smaller producers from Chambolle-musigny, Morey-Saint-Denis and Gevrey-Chambertin ...Nice people, great tasting, awesome wines, good prices...)

wine,39b4mv,dmbream,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:24:40 2015 UTC,"Personal recommendations for Burgundy from Ms. Geri Tashjian of the Burgundy Wine Company wine shop in NYC:  https://www.burgundywinecompany.com    It's really hard to get appointments with the ""must-do"" growers. They have become so overwhelmed with visitors in recent years (and have so little wine, with recent crop shortages) that they're saying no a lot more.   My suggestion would be to make an appointment with one of the larger ""houses"" - who have the staff to handle visitors. And - the wine. May be the more impressive tastings.   My top list would be Joseph Drouhin, Faiveley, Bouchard Fils et Pere (careful, not Bouchard Aine) or Louis Jadot.  On the small scale negotiant side would be Lucien Le Moine. If you can get an appointment - it would be THE MOST entertaining, informative and delicious tasting. It's owned and managed by a husband and wife team, Mounir Saouma and Rotem Brakin. They're great and so are their wines.  Some of the top (smaller) growers you could try would include Comte Lafon (Meursault), Chateau de la Maltroye (Chassagne-Montrachet), Marquis d'Angerville (Volnay), Armand Rousseau (Gevrey-Chambertin), Meo Camuzet  (Vosne-Romanee).  I could go on, but don't want to send you spinning your wheels. I would go with the first group mentioned.   Or if you want to wing it - there are lots of small growers who are open to the public for tastings. You'll see them in every village - plenty of signage - and probably fun.  Hope this helps!  Best, Geri"

wine,39c2i9,thisnicelady,2,Wed Jun 10 22:42:41 2015 UTC,Another vote for Waiheke. Plenty of choices of vineyards. Catch the ferry over and taxi between them. (much more cost effective than the bus if you have a group.) Wild on Waiheke is great for a lunch stop if you want to try archery or laser clay bird shooting.
wine,39c2i9,IndefiniteStudies,2,Thu Jun 11 00:41:11 2015 UTC,Waiheke is great for a day trip. Look up Kumeu too. I don't think it's more than 30-45mins drive out of the city and has quite a few good vineyards.

wine,39c2i9,vinonymous,2,Thu Jun 11 10:28:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely go to Waiheke. Get yourself a rental car and visit: Man O War, Te Motu, Passage Rock, Jurassic Ridge. I'd say skip Cable Bay because it's super crowded and it's not even the best wine on the Island. A rental car is a must, as the island is actually really large and very spread out. It's worth staying overnight, it's absolutely beautiful and a great place to spend time."

wine,39bbst,SmileTolerantly,4,Fri Jun 12 21:15:42 2015 UTC,"Most large bottle shop chains do regular tastings on Fridays and Saturdays so it's always worth going in if you have time to broaden your palate. Usually a mix of 'own brand' products, some beers or RTDs and one standout but some stores will often put on something interesting.   South Melbourne has a number of awesome independents, and they all do regular tastings. Cloud Wine and Prince Wine (SM), Toorak Cellars (right near Prahran), City Wine Shop (North CBD), Boccacio's (Balwyn) all have awesome tastings.   Buy fruit forward wines when you're starting out. Try a juicy Yarra Valley Pinot Noir, a South Australian Merlot or GSM (a blend of Grenache, Shiraz and Mourverdre), and other similar fruit forward styles. You don't have to buy the 'chick wines' as the 'fruit sweetness' of those suggested varieties will often give the impression of sweetness without actually having alot of sugar (not a great quality in a red outside of Vintage Port).  Tl;dr: Try everything once, don't make up your mind about anything as often nothing is 100 per cent consistent in style or flavour."
wine,39bbst,Send_Lawyers,2,Wed Jun 10 20:40:39 2015 UTC,"I'll drop by Dan Murphy's today, I think they have one red on this weeks tasting according to their website. Definitely going to give those independents a try when I have time, benefit of large chains is that they are a lot more accessible but obviously won't be as good.   It's great having all these reds to try since I can look them up on the wine guide in the sidebar which makes a lot more sense now :) I think I know at the very least that I would prefer light-medium bodied wines but going to have to try some before I can even settle on a preference! Thanks  Edit: Any specific suggestions for a Yarra Valley Pinot Noir or a South Australian Merlot <$30?"
wine,39bbst,vinonymous,3,Fri Jun 12 21:22:51 2015 UTC,Two wines to dry that can highlight the range of styles across Australia is a Shiraz from the hunter valley like brokenwood. And a Shiraz from the Barossa like penfolds or 1857.   This wines will both have a fruity and pepper varietal expression with hints of oak. But the acid is much higher in the hunter and you will be able to taste the difference.   In Victoria compare a Pinot from the Yarra and one from Tasmania. Again the difference will be noticeable and will give you an idea of your personal preference.

Dan's do tastings, too. Don't be afraid to ask for service at the tasting cart. Independent bottle shops tend to have much better events though.  Grill your local bottleshop guys. Find the ones that know what they're talking about - at independent shops this will be most, at places like Dan's ask for a wine expert. Don't be afraid to ask questions, here or in person."

Cheers for the openness, what are the usual questions? Or is it more of a case of there being no such thing as a stupid question and just ask stuff about the wine out of curiosity.  Because of the value, I might actually give them both a try tonight and see how it goes! Thanks :)"

wine,39bbst,vinonymous,2,Sat Jun 13 07:06:34 2015 UTC,"Great suggestions here - you'd probably like some of the lighter, fruitier wines like Pinot Noir, Merlot or GSM, or even ask for some light Spanish or Italian wines. As others have mentioned, there's some great small wine shops around Melbourne; apart from those, Dan Murphy's has a good selection and some of the best prices around.  If you're totally unsure and just want a cheap decent red, Aldi stocks a $6 Spanish Tempranillo (I think), which is very quaffable."

While they were interesting they were almost waxy and the clay covered any fruit flavors that were probably present in the wine before aging. It was different but not something I would recommend to anyone besides maybe a mescal drinker looking to switch to wine.

The single greatest resource I have found for studying wine is guildsomm.com and you get a free years membership when you sign up for the level 1 exam. So basically read through your booklet and study all of the material on the website as you go.   Also if you plan to take level 2, which is basically a no-brainer since level one is pretty much a waste of time if you don't, there is no such thing as overkill. Study as much as possible and use the level one class/test as a guide, join a tasting group, and practice service."

I found the world atlas of wine by Johnson and Robinson to be very helpful. The best thing I did before the exam was showing up to the class focused, rested, and prepared to soak up all that information at a terrible time in the morning.

Language won't be as much of an issue, and you can work on your French there, and do regular, quick trips to France.

You can always identify the region a person is from by how they speak.   There are things you can say which will make you stand out like a sore thumb in every region and will confuse in every region.  OP want to blend in learn the dialect.  Everywhere has a regional dialect and foreign influx as this is the regions history.   To say it doesn't is utterly foolish as it ignores well the last few thousand years of history.   You studied literature? that's nice.   Formalized language IS NOT living French nor is it even historical French.   Interestingly enough the closest one to formalized French, which you tote as the only French, is Algerian French. Why? French is still the first language of the upper classes therefore it is highly formalized as a status symbol.  Regional dialects are living language there isn't a populated place on this planet which is free from this.  You've spend way too much time studying books and not enough time living life and experiencing.   You might as well be German."

You're talking about accents, vernaculars and colloqualisms that vary a bit here and there, but anybody learning French in Paris or Bordeaux or Lille will be understood anywhere else in the country.  I also never said anything as ""formalized French"". I think you must have confused me with another poster. You used dialect in its other definition. We just misunderstood each other. I used it from a linguistic perspective, you use it from a cultural perspective. That's all. No need to get nasty.  (I studied literature AND linguistics.

Every region has a dialect to argue otherwise is silly.  People are most comfortable around people who talk like themselves.  Now what does this mean? think back on what OP asked.  The theme of the thread is how to make the most of a year in France in relation to wine.  OP wanted to fit in and experience the local life.   I told them learn the dialect repeatedly.   Why? so you'll make them comfortable of course!  Talk to a dock worker and talk to I don't know a proctologist. What will happen? You'll get wildly different speech patterns and these vary from region to region. What happens when you attempt to speak to the proctologist as you would a dock worker? they tune you out.  What does this mean?  Learn the living regional language for what you'd like to do.  Then you went on your spiel about that French is a monolithic block which is utterly asinine. I actually did a spit take, my first, on seeing that.   Try actually going out to these regions rather than relying on mental abstracts you may learn a thing or two.   I suggest you find another vocation if you can make such silly errors. You're reading comprehension is quite low as it appears you can't stay on the OP's topics.  Your linguistic training is rather suspect at the moment which causes me to doubt your claims.  Side note: I should mention I come from a wine producing family so I know the lingo quite well to be frank it's not formal French at all.

Methods that teach European French do so usually with a soft Northern French accent. In Europe, most French classes - in universities, at the Alliance Française or by other organizations - are generally taught by native speakers, usually from France, and they could be from all over. You don't get to choose a ""dialect"". You are taught conversational, contemporary French. Your teacher might have a thick Parisian accent, or a strong Marseilles accent, but they are taught common, colloquial French as spoken in France.  I grew up around Paris and have no problem understanding my friends from the Rhône Valley, my brother-in-law from Toulouse, my relatives from Brittany, and never had to make anybody repeat anything when visiting or living in any other area of France. I never had any problems understanding my Belgian friends either, save a couple of misunderstandings on the different words they use for ""towel"" or other local expressions.  So unless you can provide more specific advice and explain to us what ""dialect"" he's supposed to learn and how and where, enough with that. He'll be just fine starting at the Alliance Française, for instance."

I can understand French speakers from Quebec to Queensland but that doesn't mean I speak the same as they do.   It's a simple truth people react better to the familiar.  It's a simple truth speech varies region to region.   Attempting to redefine and contextualize away is pointless as that's not what the OP asked for.  Now what did OP ask?  OP asked how to make the most of their experience.  I told them a simple way how to repeatedly.  You went off on a tangent.   Your tangent is not the topic.

wine,39704p,phauwn,3,Tue Jun 9 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"huh... there's quite a difference between ""not big wine collectors"" and ""do not enjoy wine whatsoever""... yet, they have a wine cellar so they must either enjoy it or collect it ;)"
wine,39704p,CondorKhan,7,Wed Jun 10 06:39:49 2015 UTC,"Did you ask them already? You should tell them what it is and let them decide whether to drink it or not. A nice dinner with your parents would be a good time to open it.  If you want to sell it, you could try something like winebid.com  However,   a) you will be charged a nice percentage of the price as commission  b) You have no idea how the bottle got there, which already is a strike against you, as far as getting full market value for your bottle. The bottles that fetch better prices have verifiable provenance. Likewise, I hope your parent's cellar is actually a good place for wine storage.  So basically you won't see nowhere near the $800-$1000 the bottle is potentially worth.  If I wasn't hurting for cash, I'd just drink it."
wine,39704p,NorthernerWuwu,3,Tue Jun 9 18:52:44 2015 UTC,Yes they are aware of the perceived value of the bottle. I am just seeking advice on what to do with it. We certainly are not hurting for cash but I think selling/trading it for 2 or 3 lower valued wines would be more enjoyable to us.
wine,39704p,winemule,2,Tue Jun 9 18:55:24 2015 UTC,Gift it to one of their/your friends or bring it over for a special occasion.   You'll likely not get any special value out of selling it but it definitely would make a nice present for any of your oenophile friends!
wine,39704p,rawdealbuffy,2,Tue Jun 9 21:27:05 2015 UTC,"This is true!  The $800-$1,000 price is the retail price. It is not the price you will get. If you can't prove provenance--which you probably can't, if it was a gift--any buyer will insist on a large discount.   When I worked for a very large New England retailer, the policy for buying wines from individuals was to offer half the going wholesale price. I'm not saying this is a common practice, just that you shouldn't expect to get a big payday out of it."
wine,39704p,hsfrey,3,Wed Jun 10 12:54:27 2015 UTC,Just pop the cork already! You may not fully appreciate the wine from a tasting standpoint but the meal and company you share it with are what really matters anyway. Just decant and take small sips.
wine,39704p,moviedude26,3,Tue Jun 9 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"If you DO drink it, don't drink it by yourself."
wine,39704p,ChalkyTannins,2,Wed Jun 10 02:33:51 2015 UTC,"Realize that until you try that bottle of wine, you and your parents have no idea whether or not you might actually appreciate how great that bottle is! You'd be throwing away a potentially amazing experience, just drink it!  This is hardly on the same level, but when I graduated high school, my friend's parents opened up a bottle of some particularly good vintage of Opus One that they'd been holding onto for just that occasion. I'd had a lot of pretty decent wines by that time, as I spent a lot of time at these folks' house and they had good bottles a few times a week, quite a luxury for a teenager! I didn't know anything about wine at that point, but I had tasted a broad enough variety with enough attentiveness that I certainly appreciated a good glass.  I'll never forget that night. My friend (who spent much of his youth in Switzerland eating at some of the worlds best restaurants and drinking a lot of good wine) and I probably had only two sips each but both of us were just floored. We didn't really know what we were drinking at all, we had just been offered a sip of some special wine, whatever. No. Not whatever. As we're both tasting, we look at each other, our eyes going wide. Holy shit. This is the best fucking wine we've ever had.   The mouthfeel and flavor profile are what I remember most. So smooth and creamy, like actually creamy, it was like drinking perfect hot chocolate. Not just in texture, but in flavor too, it was chocolaty in a way I'd never tasted at the time. All that was perfectly counterbalanced by this rounded electric cherry that was penetrating without being sharp, between which was a whole spectrum of other qualities I couldn't identify at the time but which were beautiful nonetheless.   It's like looking through a fantastic telescope at a well selected swath of sky on an exceptionally clear night. You don't have to know a thing about astronomy to experience the power of that celestial beauty, and similarly I can't imagine anyone with the slightest interest in taste not appreciating the power of a great glass of wine like that."
wine,39704p,moviedude26,2,Tue Jun 9 22:13:43 2015 UTC,Oddly enough Opus One is the best wine I've tasted myself. I also got a bottle of Opus One out of cleaning out the house. My experience and first sip of Opus was similar to you.

wine,395vxs,spacedude86,6,Tue Jun 9 14:03:18 2015 UTC,Why not look next door in Oregon?  The Willamette Valley is home to the best Pinot in the US (my opinion).  Elk Cove is one producer with a number of excellent options.  Big Table Farm is another....
wine,395vxs,liquid_massage,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:29:10 2015 UTC,My favorite Willamette Valley pinot is Rex Hill.

wine,395vxs,ifeelhome,2,Tue Jun 9 23:46:22 2015 UTC,Excellent suggestions. Are you from the area? I'm from Newberg.

Also - ""lost a brow"" actually was supposed to be ""Kosta Browne"" lol. I guess drinking wine at a Marriot has burdened by typing!"
wine,395vxs,ifeelhome,4,Wed Jun 10 00:04:00 2015 UTC,"If you go looking at Oregon & the Willamette valley, you should consider Bergstrom, they are our favorite OR pinot producer and not super well-known.    From CA I'd suggest 'Small Vines', they are hard to find, however.  Depending on your ability to get around, I am in Kirkland/Bellevue have a fairly deep cellar for both of those and would be happy to pull something out for you to give as a gift, something with a few years of age.   No markup or anything, just what it cost me.  PM me for more info.  edit: because me grammar good."
wine,395vxs,radiofragments,3,Tue Jun 9 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"Well, the good news is that you live in a fantastic area for fine wine.  The bad news is you're giving us almost nothing to go on.  If you want a pinot noir, look to Oregon.  Willamette pinots are well-known for excellence."
wine,395vxs,theultrayik,4,Tue Jun 9 15:50:31 2015 UTC,Patz & Hall makes a nice Pinot Noir for around $50. Belle Glos (same maker as Meiomi) also makes a nice one. Both are from California.
wine,395vxs,hossboss69,5,Tue Jun 9 14:13:28 2015 UTC,Belle Glos is a polarizing wine (like Meiomi) and atypical for pinot noir.  I would advise against it given OP's lack of specific knowledge about his/her coworker's wine taste.
wine,395vxs,fursink,2,Tue Jun 9 17:32:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that Oregon has some great Pinot, however it seems like you prefer California since you and this co-worker tastes there together. Rochioli and Papapietro Perry both make some terrific pinots for $56, or Macrostie for right in the $46 range. Can't go wrong with any of the three, honestly, and they're all smaller places in Healdsburg."

They bottles are ridiculously attractive and they are on the upper end of your price range. I met the owner a year ago, he's a real down to earth guy and stands behind his work. One of the best pinots I've had!"
wine,395vxs,ferchristssakestopit,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"You're looking for too many things - there isn't a lot of ""local"" pinot noir in Washington, nor are there too many rare gems in the $30-50 price range.  That said - take a look at some pinot's from Sojourn, MacPhail, Rivers Marie (and if you really want gems - find some Kosta Browne, though you'll need to double your budget)  EDIT:  winesearcher.com and cellartracker.com will be helpful as people give you suggestions."

wine,3962ed,KDB82,4,Tue Jun 9 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"I went to Alsace and had a blast.  We drove from Strasbourg to Colmar stopping at villages and visiting producers along the way.  Apart from the big names (Trimbach, Zind-Humbrecht, Marcel Deiss, etc) I suggest visiting small producers Florian Beck Hartweg and Boeckl.   Be mindful that this isn't California... most wineries are small, family run and they don't have tours and tasting rooms. You'll be tasting in the barrel room with the owner, who lives on site and probably has his fingers dirty from working on the vines outside. It helps to call ahead. Also, don't interrupt their lunch. I did this at a domaine and got a dirty look.   As far as food, I don't know your budget but the best meal of my life was at L'Auberge de L'Ill in Illhausern, just outside Colmar. If you're sure you want to go, call NOW to get your reservation. Bill was 450 euro for 2 people.  Le Maison des Tanneurs in Strasbourg is touristy but it was awesome.  A lot of things are closed in August, by the way. Make sure the places you want to go are open.  Take your time and don't try to do too much. You don't want to rush. Every village in Alsace is ridiculously beautiful. Soak it all in with no pressure."

wine,3962ed,CondorKhan,2,Tue Jun 9 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't call and it was a bad idea.  In any future trip, I will call. I was lucky that Florian was open and available.  I arrived at the village of Otrott just about lunch and knocked at a Pinot Noir producer and they were having lunch and got the dirtiest look. They agreed to take me in and I made sure to buy their stuff. Had I called ahead, I'd know what their availability is.  I'd call a few days ahead just to make sure.  The bigger producers do have tasting rooms with staff. You can just walk into Trimbach pretty much."

In Alsace like /u/condorkhan said take your time and make appointments. Eat a lot of Tart Flambe and in Colmar find this joint they will take care of you when it comes to wine. In Burgundy stop in Dijon and hang out and the drive down slowly and hit every village.

If you're able to score 80% consistently first off you should be okay if you have 3 weeks to cram and you seriously know your wines and tasting protocol (40 hours a week should do it). App is much, much easier than exam.   Some tips - you should be able to freehand most of the maps in the coursework along with wine regions, soils, techniques. Know your techniques and minor regions for things like sherry and obscure Spanish grape varieties. Be able to memorise the entire checklist for tasting notes. Be able to identify each major wine by flavour profile (and by this, I'm including things like pinotage and torrontes).  Also, in the exam, they usually cover everything so if you're really stuck with a question, and it's the only one left, cross off all the topics you've covered and take a punt (this is what got me through).

It's essentially lvl 2 with more depth.  Don't even worry too much about the tasting, just make sure you can write a good tasting note (getting the wine right is only like 1-2 pts out of 25).  Don't neglect port / sherry / madeira / VDN / spirits.  It really depends on you...

Yes, there might be a dog in the mix, but given the DTC game now they probably wouldn't risk losing a customer with a bad offering. And to those commenting they wouldn't give away good wine at a loss, just remember these producers are used to selling the product at 30-50% of retail to distributors so anything above that is a bonus in some cases."

wine,38z1df,heavyhandedpour,2,Mon Jun 8 01:30:41 2015 UTC,"You always get what you pay for. No retailer is going to jus give away good wine at a loss to themselves. Maybe they'll take a hit on a couple bottles, but nothing crazy."
wine,38z1df,diamondsealtd,2,Mon Jun 8 13:08:42 2015 UTC,"While the distribution company doesn't do this, we do obviously mark down wine for clearance from time to time.

wine,38zydy,splashtonkutcher,-2,Mon Jun 8 18:56:39 2015 UTC,"Know Your Wines - Some Tips That Can Help  Drinking wine is something people enjoy doing for many different reasons and occasions. But, to truly get the most out of wine, you need to do your research. In the following piece, you will be given advice to help ensure you know everything about wine, thus, improving your experience with it.  Particularly if you are just discovering wine, don't buy too much of any one thing. You may want to grab several bottles of whatever you enjoy, but as you continue learning more, you are going to start to like different things. You probably won't be interested in the wine that you enjoyed several months ago.  If you are looking for a good deal on wine, try to purchase it from the rack at a liquor store. Generally, you will find that these are the items that are on sale or the dealer wants to get rid of the fastest. The quality of these wines has not dissipated though, so you can score a great deal this way.  Wine cellars are a wise investment for the serious wine drinker or collector. This can really be important when you spend a lot of money on a wine and you wish to have some later on. A wine cellar will preserve and enhance the quality of your wine over extended periods.  Sometimes, you will find that cheap wine can do the trick. If you want an excellent and affordable wine, purchase a bottle from Chile. A lot of their wines have good prices. Be sure to really look at Cabernet Sauvignons and Sauvignon Blancs. Other international favorites include labels from New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.  If you have a cellar or even just a rack where you can store wine, do not fill the space completely with the wines that you like right now. Your tastes are bound to change over time. You don't want to be stuck with many cases of a brand you no longer drink.  If you are trying to find a way to drink a less-expensive wine, consider making it into a punch or Sangria. Adding some fruit, a bit of sweet soda and a little ice can completely change the taste. This makes for a nice addition to a baby shower or birthday party, and one of your guests is sure to enjoy.  Every true wine lover needs to explore wine country at least once in their life. Wine country is very beautiful, and you will learn much more about your hobby.  Don't fall for the trap that cheap wine is bad and expensive wine is good. There are exceptional inexpensive wines and wines that cost a small fortune that are difficult to drink. Experience as many different types as you can, no matter the price. WHo knows - you may find a favorite that is well within your everyday drinking budget.  Believe it or not, the glass you choose to drink your wine out of can have a major affect on your drinking experience. You want a glass whose bowl is round so that the aroma can develop. Also, the top should taper inward; this prevents its essence from getting out.  Have a basic idea of what kind of wine you like. Even if you are not sure of what brand, winery or region you prefer, it is pretty easy to determine if you prefer a blush, red or white. By knowing just this basic fact, you can more easily determine which wines are worth trying for your next meal.  When tasting wine, you should avoid distractions as much as possible. Keep in mind that the presence of a strong smell in the room might influence how you perceive the aroma of the wine you are tasting. The temperature of the room and of the bottle you are tasting will also influence your impressions.  Look around your local area for good wines. Wine is produced in ALL 50 states. You may find a great vineyard that you can take a day trip to. Supporting your local wine growers is great in itself; however, there are many gems being made right here at home that often go overlooked.  As the beginning of this piece discussed, people like to drink wine for a number of reasons. To really enjoy wine though, you need to be sure you have conducted research about it. If you use the advice this piece discussed, the next glass of wine you drink will be the best you have ever had."

wine,38yg9w,drunken1,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:38:56 2015 UTC,"On March 25, the Association des Viticulteurs d’Alsace (AVA) voted almost unanimously to require the word “sec” or “dry” on a wine label if it meets those standards. The proposition will now be taken to the Institut National de l'Origine et de la Qualité (INAO), which oversees all French appellations.   As of right now there is no change to the current regulations.  The Association des Viticulteurs d’Alsace sounds like a growers group that can make recommendations to the INAO.   The INAO is the governing body of French wine regulations.  This is like a US congressional committee voting a bill through.  This does not mean it becomes law.  It would now go to the main floor for a vote.  It is a step in the process."

I know it's not actually law and if passed won't take effect until vintages that haven't even happened, but at least we are working towards more clarity in Alsatian wines which I appreciate.   One thing I don't think was fully addressed in the article: I get that certain produces think that this will be hard on producers that make off-dry wines, but I really think this will be better overall because it's will be so much easier to sell their wines! Dry or off dry, they might be awesome but if there's a way to tell the difference it makes the wines easier to sell."
wine,38yg9w,vinomenal,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:52:44 2015 UTC,The only way I can reason that producers wouldn't want this in place is if they know that there is a trend for dry wines and they don't produce them. This means they kind of are hoping to sneak their wines into people's carts.

wine,38yx0q,sunglasses85,5,Mon Jun 8 00:44:39 2015 UTC,The best way to start learning about wine is to start learning about wine.  Pick up The Wine Bible by Karen MacNeil and get reading!
wine,38yx0q,theultrayik,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:40:31 2015 UTC,"The Wine Bible is a great reference to someone studying for an exam, I wouldn't recommend it to someone just getting started though  It reads like an encyclopedia.  There are some great movies, both fiction and non, on the subject of wine. Bottle Shock is a great story about early California wine makers. Mondo Vino is a good watch as well. Netflix recently had Red Obsession on, which profiles the riae of the Chinese middle class and the effects on the global wine market.  Ifni were to recommend a book, it would probably be Wine and War. It chronicles the second world war and the wine market in that time period...  But I'm a bit of a military history nerd. Very interesting stuff to combine the war and the juice that all of Europe loves."

I would say just the opposite.  Windows on the World is written for someone doing professional study, and it's more like a textbook.  However, The Wine Bible is much less formal and is written with a lot more personality.  It has more of a guidebook feel to it and has lots of flavor text, and it's accompanied by a lot of little photos and cultural/historical sidebars.  It's great for the non-professional who just wants to get a handle on the world of wine."

Take some time and go out to a few local wine shops; it's closer than wine country and you can pick up some nice bottles while you're there. Two of my favorites are: Arlequin on Hayes street & Noe Valley Wine Merchant on 24th. The staff there are super knowledgeable and friendly, please do ask them questions. Hope you have fun!"
wine,38yx0q,AdvancedAlgebra,2,Mon Jun 8 02:25:42 2015 UTC,"The people that work at wineries want you to learn about wine and are ready to answer questions. Just see if you can get a tour with someone who knows about wine. Some of the people at the tasting bar don't have a ton of knowledge, some do. Your girlfriend will probably be more impressed with your ability to be forward and willing to discover and learn. See if any of the wineries can hook you up with a nice tour with someone in wine making or production. Don't worry about not knowing, that is the journey of wine."
wine,38yx0q,Wineguy33,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"Don't feel intimidated! Most of the people who are pouring wine in Napa are still learning, too. They remember what it was like to know nothing, and they'll be happy to make you guys feel at home. You don't need to now anything, unless you're interested.   For tasting, the major thing to do is be mindful. Think about the color of the wine, the smell, the taste, the finish. Ask questions about anything you experience.   In terms of getting around, Uber is an option, but do realize that the valley has far fewer drivers than San Francisco, which means we often get surge pricing. If I were you, I'd check out the cost of renting a car (if one of you will be sober) or hiring a driver.   The general rule of thumb is, the bigger the vineyard, the more likely it is that you'll be able to show up without a reservation. For big places like Caymus or Rombauer, you can just show up. However, if you want to got to Ballentine or Casa Neuestra, you should make a reservation."

The wine  Bible is good and I am going through it right now, I found Windows of the World to be less dense though (though it has less information).     But go explore.   Just taste and be open.   There are styles of wine I don't like and manage to find bottles I like.     Where I started was a wine tour in Sonoma on a trip in  San Francisco.  Then did some more tasting in a wine shop.   Then I read online, watched videos (Gary Vaynerchuk's wine library series on YouTube is good, though I can people not liking him).  It is all over the place too, it isn't structured, but a ton of content.   But yes, there is tons of information but just jump in.  You are going to find wines you like and don't regardless of how much you know.   By learning more you get to articulate why you like and don't like something, but at least early on you can still enjoy it.  Also one thing to note, outside a few flavor notes, most of the smells and flavors of wine are subtle.   If you don't pick out honeydew, don't sweat it.  There are times that people will tall about a glass and I wonder of we are drinking Wine from the server bottle.  Oh, and remember sweet and fruity in wine are not the same thing.   That is probably the most common mistake I see made and certainly one I made early on too."
wine,38yx0q,dunno260,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:25:58 2015 UTC,"Good advice so far.  I'd also suggest the following: when you want to start exploring and go wine tasting, forget about Napa and Sonoma for now. Those tasting rooms are expensive and can be intimidating. Go to emerging wine regions where the tasting room staff is going to be more approachable and casual, and tasting fees (if any) will be more affordable. Look into Amador County, El Dorado, Lake County, or San Luis Obispo."

wine,38xnre,PapiRugby,3,Sun Jun 7 18:48:41 2015 UTC,"Ruffino is the largest producer in Chianti, and they offer wine at many different quality levels. But the vintages are the giveaway: Chianti in the 1970s, with the exception of the very top producers, was uniformly dreadful. For reasons that would take too long to explain here, a lot of low-quality Sangiovese was planted, beginning in the 1950s. I mean like if you'd gone to Home Depot and bought vines. Italian vineyards in the 1970s were in shockingly poor condition, due in part to the quantity-over-quality mindset. Most of it got grubbed up and replanted in the '80s, which is when the wines of Chianti began to restore their quality. (This is a gross simplification of what happened...but it happened.)"

At 20$ retail, that often leaves 5-7$ for the producer after transport, markups (retailers', importers', brokers' and distributors' and US law usually requires at least a retailer and a distributor who must be separate licensed businesses), taxes, duties and excises, all of which vary dramatically from one place to the next as ""sin taxes"" are very popular...  A good place to look would be Reserva Riojas although a lot of producers elect to release them with already a lot of the aging done. Also lower end Barbarescos like the basic from Produttori del Barbaresco or similar price point approaches 20$ in some markets (online searches often find the Langhe from them instead of the Barbaresco, buyer beware though it drinks very well as well.)  How long do you expect to age the bottle? 5 years? 10? 25?"

Most of the comments here seem to be saying that a wine worth aging under $20 isn't possible, but I don't think I agree. I've had some awesome wines in that price range that drank well after 10-15 years. Now, if you're talking about aging the wine 20+ years, everyone here might be entirely correct.   Rioja is a great place to start, like others have said. Extremely undervalued.   Riesling is another grape that is massively undervalued but ages well. I've had GREAT German Riesling for around $20 with 10-15 years worth of aging on them.   You can find some good Australian Shiraz that ages nicely for just over $20, but you need to be careful. Lots of crap coming out of Australia, too.  Zinfandel isn't normally thought of as a wine that ages well, but I've had some beautiful bottles that were 10+ years old. And Zinfandel is pretty cheap!  Again, take my comments with a grain of salt. This is all based on my limited experience. But I do think that, with some luck, you can score a $20 of wine that will drink well for a decade or two."

You can use the extra money to try out a Beaujolais if you like. They're made from the Gamay grape, which is a grape that makes even lighter and easier to drink wines than Pinot does. Even the best Beaujolais will be sub $20, so they are an excellent bargain and could easily fit in your budget.

Gifting it to someone? Enjoying with dinner? Out on the patio?   If you're new to wine, take that $60 and put it toward a few different $20 bottles. If your first thought was Pinot, put $20-30 toward an Oregon bottle and $30-40 toward a Burgundy. Determine if you like Old World or New World styles. If you want to try a few different varietals, go for a $20 Oregon Pinot, a $25ish California cab, and a $15-20 Italian bottle - Barbera is really approachable and fairly smooth.   As a general rule, spending a healthy amount of money on a bottle is going to be largely unappreciated by someone new to wine. Since you're not sure what you like yet, you'd be better off trying new things than going all-out on one.   To answer your question, my first choice for $60 would be either a Margaux from an under-appreciated vintage (probably '08) or something amazing and Italian. '04 Barolo if I could find some close to that price point. Age is going to mellow tannins, which is probably what you mean by smooth."

New World = North and South America, Australia/NZ, South Africa. The ones who haven't been growing grapes quite as long.   Large generalizations ahead:   Old World wines tend to be more acidic, tend to pair better with food (because of high acidity). Tend to be have more earthy/mushroom-y/barnyard-y characteristics. Reds tend to be less fruit-forward, more nuanced. Tend to age much better.   New World wines tend to be much more extracted. Big fruit up front, usually higher alcohol. Tend to be more approachable when young. For the price point, tend to have less complexity and are easy-drinking. Many New World wines are aged in American oak, which imparts a much stronger woodsy character than French oak does.   I often say that Old World wines pair best with food, while New World wines pair best with friends.   If you're in SoCal and have a Total Wine near you, go there on the weekend. They should offer a tasting at low to no cost. It will allow you to try up to six different wines and start educating your palette so you can better identify maybe not what you do like, but definitely what you don't.

White has less alcohol by volume, so maybe it's easier to get into trouble with red. For me the symptoms are waking up after about four hours, but with a mental clarity that you wouldn't normally expect at that time. Although my mind is clear, the wakefulness is fairly fragile; it's not as if I can take advantage of being up. Three things help me break the alertness and fall back to sleep. 1.) Cold shower. Counter intuitive, but somehow being too warm and being wakeful seem related. 2.) Another glass of wine. I've found that if I can break the alertness, I can go back to sleep. It's not ideal, but it's better than not sleeping. 3.) As an alternative, the prescription medicine zaleplon is amazing. It stays in your system only a short time so in about 3.5 hours you can wake up feeling pretty normal. I'm not sure about driving though, so you'll need to be careful.

To add, I've always found it ironic that the review structure for a complex, nuanced, and sophisticated product like wine (or beer) is shoehorned into a uni-dimensional system."
wine,38t9zm,Averagejoeqpublic,2,Sat Jun 6 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"This is why I prefer cellartracker.  If I'm buying blind, I typically trust the notes posted by reviewers -- they're not casual wine drinkers, they're tough-to-please winos who tend to judge a wine based on what it is rather than against wine as a whole.  A $12 bottle that gets an 89 on CT is going to be spectacular.  A 95 point wine by Parker?  Regardless of price, who the fuck knows."
wine,38t9zm,HRP,0,Sat Jun 6 21:17:01 2015 UTC,"Eh, let's be fair though. I can't say I've had too many 95+ pointers that actually disapointed.   For the price? Quite possibly. As a decent bottle of wine? None that I can think of."
wine,38t9zm,NorthernerWuwu,2,Sun Jun 7 08:17:15 2015 UTC,"I've always hated how people use a numbered scale and don't even use the bottom half (or bottom 4/5). Maybe the best wine I've ever had, on a scale using all 100 points, is still only a 60? That's much more impressive to me than a 93-point Bordeaux."
wine,38t9zm,enforcetheworld,10,Sat Jun 6 22:55:27 2015 UTC,"As an American wimemaker, I couldn't be more annoyed with it. It amazes me how a ""score"" makes such a difference to people's perception of that wine, both consciously but even more so unconsciously. There is pressure to get scores of a certain caliber to please the owners (so they don't feel like they are wasting their money), the sales team (cause it is sooo much easier to sell wine with a good score), and even your customer base (because even if they already love your wine, they may love it less if it didn't score well and they may want to impress their friends with scores when they share the wine with them). And yes, when scores are about to be released, no matter how hard I try not to care, no matter how confident I am in the wines' quality, it still feels like school when they are handing back midterms and you are about to see the grade that will determine 25% of your final grade. There is just so much riding on it, it is hard not to get caught up. I know some winemakers try to make their wine in a certain way in order for it score well, and I think that is the saddest part of the whole thing.   Now, to show both sides, I have to speak about the necessity of scores in the wine industry. In a sea of different regions, varieties, styles, etc, no one knows what to try. Especially with the price of wine these days, people want some kind of guarantee that at least somebody liked it enough to give it a good score. This is why the majority of wine consumers rely on scores to make purchasing decisions. My father is a good example. When I visit, he says ""try this,  it got a 92 from WS and only cost $28"" or something like that. He wants to pour me something good, and that is an easy way for him to do so without going to a while lot of trouble. The people use the scores to buy the wine, so the sales team wants the scores to sell the wine. The ownership likes to sell the wine, too, but usually it ends up being a oneupmanship game with their other winery owning friends.   All this ends up focusing pressure back at the winemaker which IMO, is bad for wine in general. It's like pushing for your kids to get good grades in school rather than learning to think for themselves. Unfortunately, this is also a problem in our schools which leads to cheating and people with degrees not knowing much of anything, but that is a discussion for another thread. Perhaps it is Americans' obsession with being ranked and winning that is the root of it all.   TL;DR - Scores are deeply ingrained in the wine industry and help sell wine, for better or worse. It is probably indicative of a deeper social obsession with winning."
wine,38t9zm,winemakerpete,2,Sat Jun 6 17:30:02 2015 UTC,It's like pushing your kids in school to get good grades instead of learn for themselves.  That's a brilliant analogy sir/ma'am.

And that comes at a much lower search cost than figuring out whether you like Parker, Tanzer, Robinson, etc.'s preferred styles.

For me, 9.5 times out of 10, a 95+ rated wine is significantly more enjoyable than a 90-91 pointer. However, I've also found ratings above ~94ish points to be of little value to me as a consumer, E.G. 95 points vs 100 points...all down to personal preference and magic voodoo, but at the very least I know it will be a quality wine."

wine,38t9zm,goats_are_orange,2,Sat Jun 6 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"Its confusing as someone new to the wine game because its not consistent enough between people.  It seems that some have a universal scale, others rate within the variety style, etc.  And then I have had 90 point wines from the same reviewer and had significantly different experiences with them.  I know that you are going to get different scores by different people for the same wine, thats not an issue on my end.  But when I taste two 90 point wines that I find aren't even in the same league with each other I just sort of shake my head (this happened recently when I tried a 90 point red blend that was $15 and a 90 point Barolo that was $50, the Barolo was fabulous, the red blend was enjoyable enough and I bought a bottle, but I just can't fathom comparing the two).  I also wish we would redo the scale.  It seems 98% of the wines you see scored fall between 85-96 points or so.  There is probably somewhat of a selection bias, I don't see a winery wanting to have Parker review a terrible wine for example, but that is too small a range IMO.  Now that my complaint is over, I don't want wine ratings to go away.  Its a nice thing to look at and understand, it helps me to read a wine review after I have tasted a wine to help formulate what the critics are rating a wine for based on what I taste because that helps me select wine I will like just from a review."

The first two points made a bad impression and it didn't get much better from there. And it's not just that I disagree with a lot of what's written here, but it's also just poor, unclear writing.  The extreme dichotomies on the point of ""Wine-Dumping Waiters"" versus just having an empty glass. It's one thing to make sure that there's always wine in a customer's glass, and that their glass is never empty. That's just good service, I'm sorry if that offends the writer. But as bad of service as I've heard of I've never legitimately seen or heard of anyone actually filling a wine glass as described here. That just seems like a made up observation. And also, it's just a waiter's job to pour the wine for the guest. If you don't like it, just tell them not to pour for you. I do this all the time and honestly waiters seem relieved because they don't have to worry about it anymore.  On ""Wine curators"" - ""seemingly unsatisfied with the perception that all they do is buy and sell wine."" Even the most basic wine professionals do far more than just buy and sell wine. Anyone who knows the first thing about sales or restaurants knows that wine or beverage directors or somms or whatever you want to call them have far more responsibilities than to just buy and sell. They have to provide a certain level of service, manage the cellar and inventory, determine cost and provide a viable wine program for the owner, and that's just the biz side. Any good somm will also make certain selections that will also help drive biz to the restaurant. If you think that the word ""Curate"" is pretentious, just say that, but don't just diss a somm who takes their job seriously. I think ""mixologist"" is kind of a pretentious word, but honestly, thank god for them. Decent cocktails and bartenders who are professionals are amazing.

From the closing paragraph:  There’s no separating the anti-intellectualism about wine knowledge from other kinds of anti-intellectualism. The idea that knowing about wine is stupid and you can prove it is exactly the kind of thinking that is gutting our universities of their humanities programs. “Oh, this doesn’t do anything for anyone, Oh, this is just for snobs, Oh, you can’t get a job or produce revenue doing this, so screw knowing about it..."""

I think she focused too much on price; maybe her point would have been better served by saying that, ""contrary to what a lot of these 'wine people are clueless snobs' articles are hinting at, bad wine does indeed exist, and a lot of times that bad wine is also very cheap, while good wine, which also exists, may tend to be more expensive.""    But she absolutely hit the nail on the head with the anti-intellectualism that fuels all this shit.  The notion that you only want to know about something--whether that's wine, art, literature, history, or really anything at all--because you're trying for some sort of affect, or because you're simply a pretentious twit is so damn infuriating.  It's portrayed as if there is something wrong with you because you want to educate yourself about a certain topic, and it's ridiculous.  There is simply so much to know, and life is so much more interesting if you're constantly learning.  The fact that so many people seem to have a problem with that maxim is frankly sickening."

I had a pricey merlot last night that initially had me making a face but the more I drank it the more I liked it. You get past the initial funk and then flavors start to make more sense. In contrast I had a cheap moscato tonight and the drinkability sorta decreased the more I drank. the simplicity that made it so drinkable to start with became overwhelming.

Nice complexity, very bold, most likely fairly high alcohol, and definitely had a strong tannin presence.   I honestly loved it, most of the people drinking it however didn't.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrantino_di_Montefalco For the region of origin that is famous.  Another are some Peidmont wines made from the Nebbiolo grape. A lot of similarities, as they are dark and full of tannins. Highly recommend as well.   People probably wouldn't expect this from Italians wines but they certainly fit the bill IMO, although with the bitterness this a bit closer to an black/dark/roasted IPA. Good luck in your search. If you are looking for bitterness, these wines are a step up from the ""bold tannins"" that often get labeled in even Cabernet Sauvignon."

wine,38huau,gothic_potato,2,Thu Jun 4 11:04:19 2015 UTC,"That's very unfortunate to hear; screws offer way more security over nails, and such a simple change could have saved so much wine from going to waste. It's not a great silver lining, but at least only one side came down instead of both."
wine,38huau,Cutoffjeanshortz37,3,Thu Jun 4 11:07:37 2015 UTC,"screws and nails provide different functions and both do a great job when used correctly.   Nails have a much higher shear strength than screws. So if your load is going to be trying to push down on the side of fastener, in like in floor joists, then nails are much better.    Screws are way better at compressive forces.  In the case of this wine rack screws would have worked better as they prevent things from pulling apart.  However with shear loads they will tend to break/fail much easier than a nail.      Just a little FYI."

But as you will find, wines made in Burgundy (The regoin in france where it is made) has a specific climate (or Terroir) that is the reason why both the red and white wines are so special.  So although you may love Chablis which is a chard, you may not like a chard from California.  This is also due to the fact that usually the wine is not matured in oak barrels in Chablis but a lot of califronian chards are.  I always say it, there isn't anything like a good Burgundy (red or white).  I'm hooked on them."

There are exceptions, though (a good Mosel Riesling will age for decades, for instance.)  However, a vintage chart will only tell you generalities -- for the best year for a specific wine, you'll probably need to seek out reviews of that wine, or see if the winemaker has recommendations  (some wineries that produce fine age-worthy wines will give advice on when to drink them.)"

wine,38inbu,VTStevesy,9,Thu Jun 4 13:48:07 2015 UTC,"If you want to do this right, I think you should increase the budget a bit."
wine,38inbu,CondorKhan,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Not only that, but 2013 in California is shaping up to be the best vintage ever."
wine,38inbu,ChalkyTannins,5,Fri Jun 5 15:24:48 2015 UTC,At that price the California cabs you find may age for 5 to 7 years but not long term. How long were you wanting to age them?
wine,38inbu,enforcetheworld,3,Thu Jun 4 14:32:14 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, most of the stuff that's worth aging hasn't even started to be released yet. I bought a bottle of Palermo from Orin Swift a few weeks ago and it seemed like you could sit on it for a while, but nothing past five years.  You're going to have to increase your budget significantly and plan on spending at least three times what you're planning now.  Most of the big guns start at around 125 and quickly escalate to horrendously expensive.  The 2012 Stag's Leaps are 125, Monte Bello is about 165, anything out of To-Kalon is going to be somewhere in between it.  I imagine the prices will hold somewhat, but no promises."
wine,38inbu,thefoolwhofollowshim,2,Thu Jun 4 15:27:20 2015 UTC,"Ya, you'll have to wait another year or so for the 2013 releases. Any 2013 out now will be of poorer quality (unless from Southern Hemisphere I guess...). If you wait about a year you can research some scores, or check in here again at that time for better advice.   Also, $50-75 is going to be your minimum for an age-worthy cab. On in that price range that I haven't seen listed here is Long Meadows Ranch Napa Cab. Well made wine, not too expensive and will age 5-10 years just fine. 2013 was a good vintage too, lots of wine should be of high quality and very age-worthy."
wine,38inbu,heavyhandedpour,2,Thu Jun 4 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"My two inexpensive, long term agers: Clos du Val Cab (sometimes Merlot too) Kendall Jackson Grand Reserve Cab.  They're more of your old school style wines that are ripe but not overripe, with excellent structure and acidity. I've had a few 2000-2002 Clos du Val cabs recently and they were still singing."
wine,38inbu,wawino,2,Thu Jun 4 14:42:42 2015 UTC,"Bernardus Marinus out of Carmel Valley, California.  It's on the northern end of your scale and the '13 hasn't been released (and wont for another few years), you can probably get a discount on a full case as well.    Another winery that makes some stuff that can sit for a good price is Pietra Santa, their Signature selection is a pretty good value if it is on special.  Again, even their entry level cab wont be out for another few years.  I really like these two wineries, and I feel like I mention them a lot, you should really check them out as it is anyway.    Pietra Santa is doing $50.00 off off of purchases over $250.00 on their Signature wines- they have their '07 Signature Cabernet for $30.00, down from $50.00; so it's a pretty nice deal."

wine,38inbu,andtheodor,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"I'd either look outside of Napa or avoid Cabernet(or both) since Cabernet that will age long-term is out of your price range and Napa itself is expensive.  Mount Eden's Domaine Eden Cabernet is about $30-35 and amazing. Easily my favorite Cabernet in the price range. It is from the Santa Cruz Mountains. It is certainly made to be more enjoyable early, but should age well for 10ish years at least. Possibly longer. The 2007s which seem to be one of the first vintages of this bottling, are still drinking well according to cellartracker. The 2013s aren't out yet.  Another option which I would do is buy some Ridge wines. They are a classic representation of California Cabernet and Zinfandel, and they make a variety of ageable bottlings in the $25-50 range(and more expensive). See recent post about some of their wines here. Some of their 2013s Zins are out. I dont think the Estate Cab is though."

wine,38hfgc,theultrayik,3,Thu Jun 4 06:37:19 2015 UTC,"Well, good luck to you.  I know a lot of ex-Mormons, and it's a difficult adjustment.  As to your question, I grew up in a family that gave me wine even as a young child (small servings, mind you), so I can't remember ever not liking it.  However, my experiences with other alcohol may provide some better perspective.  My dad started giving me beer around 12 or 13, but I remember hating it.  I thought it tasted like piss.  I tried it off and on again over the years, but I didn't end up liking it until I was 18.  However, 18 was the age where I started trying liquor, and then I hated that.  I thought it was too strong, and that the only flavor I could discern was noxious, overpowering alcohol.  It took me until about 24 to start really enjoying liquor and cocktails.    It takes a while to get used to the flavor of alcohol.  It is a powerful chemical that you're putting into your body, and it requires some familiarity to accept.  Pairing it with good food helps, and so does drinking with good company.  If you stick with it a bit, you'll find over time that you start enjoying it."

Viognier, Chenin Blanc, and Riesling would all be good wines to start with as they have varying degrees of sweetness and even when dry they are abundantly fruity and have very little bitterness to them. If you are determined to drink red wines try Gamay (Beaujolais) or Grenache based wines. I would avoid Bordeaux or any of the heavier reds as they have more tannin (bitterness) and are going to be hard to start off with."

wine,38dchn,MathBio,18,Wed Jun 3 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"In short, I don't but there's a reason.  Minerality in wine and minerality in water are very, very different things. In water it comes from minerals and, although mineral water is discernable from non-mineral water, is debatable in terms of impact. In wine it has nothing to do with actual minerals themselves and certainly has nothing to do with the mineral content of the soil (there is no mechanism for transport to the fruit). Terroir can and does produce minerality in the wine but it doesn't do it by any simple mechanism like ""chalk in the soil makes chalky tasting wine"".   Minerality coming directly from the minerals (nutrients) in the ground remains something that’s impossible to happen. Professor Alex Maltman, of the Institute of Geography and Earth Sciences at the University of Wales said “although the notion that minerality is the taste of vineyard minerals still sweeps all before it, I have further reasons for saying that minerality is not literally the taste of vineyard minerals. Whatever it is, it’s indirect.”  He explained “I have more analytical data corroborating mineral elements in wine are incredibly small. Even potassium rarely exceeds a few hundred parts per million (ppm) with a few tens of ppm for calcium and magnesium; most of the rest, such as the metals copper and zinc, are in parts per billion.” Additionally he said “these are tasteless anyway, and their concentrations in wine are below sensory thresholds measured in water.”   As well, it is hard to define what we mean by the tasting note, never mind if it has a basis in a specific compound.   In 2010 Ballester started sensory analysis from which results showed that experts simply don’t agree on minerality. There were some shared words when freely describing minerality immediately after some blind tasting exercises. He said “cues such as fresh, acidic, the smell of stones, salty, seashore, chalky things. Actually they described not that many ideas, and the ones that everyone thinks.” But in the tasting prior to their defining the term, the results show no trends or correlation. No agreement at all. He said “my impression was a lower disagreement in the declared definition than the level of disagreement in the tasting.” There should be no surprise by this result, minerality means different things to different people, and the industry lacks consistency of interpretation and communication about minerality.   Now, this doesn't mean that minerality in tasting is a myth. We've found a number of thiols that directly produce specific mineral tasting notes (although I would note that the very idea of minerality as a tasting note is very modern) and this is reproducible. I wouldn't want to try matching that to a mineral water though."
wine,38dchn,NorthernerWuwu,3,Wed Jun 3 15:50:28 2015 UTC,"Excellent comment. I will keep using it as a tasting note to be able to discuss and compare, but it's time people understand this and don't keep talking about the actual soil in the wine. I hear this many times a week around customers.  I'm also thinking some phenolic aromas with white-peppery and smoky qualities contributes a lot to what people associate with minerality in wine. Easier to pick out in crisp white wines than any red. In reds the aroma of Geosmin can come across like minerality."
wine,38dchn,fromscratch404,3,Wed Jun 3 17:06:18 2015 UTC,"I believe it was Jamie Goode who coined the term ""mineralic"" as descriptor for wines, in the chapter of Authentic Wine that discusses terroir. I've also seen it used as a term of art in perfume formulation. I used the word for a while in my reviews, but I guess I've given up on it now--it seems to just create additional confusion on the part of readers. I still think it is a more appropriate descriptor, in that it moves away from the idea of actual minerals in wine. For more on this, here's a link to the study cited in the original post by Alex Maltman, who helpfully points out how recent the phenomenon of ""minerality"" as a descriptor actually is."
wine,38dchn,winemule,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I do use it as a descriptor and I absolutely do think that it has a place when used in that way. The tricky bit for me is to ensure that I'm not being dishonest and slipping into the territory of ""terroir becoming a tasting note directly"".  It is too easy to stray and start on about how Chablis has this soil and hence... and that's bullshit. I mean, not bullshit bullshit (it does and yes, as a result) but the idea of using gravel from your vineyard to make your cement egg so that the wine will have more minerality is straight-up shite. It's still a cool (and efficacious!) thing to do of course but fuck off pretending that it will make your wine taste like gunflint.  I walk a close enough line without further temptation."

Over here in France it seems like all cavistes and growers I talk to, in addition to all the literature, pay a lot of attention to minerality.

There is a whole world full of less expensive (and better quality) wines than stags leap 60$ range. My typical price range is 15-50$ and I believe it should be a rare exception to spend more or less than this range in a retail store.  For what you're spending and the volume you're buying you can do so much better. 60$ is a single vineyard Ken Wright Pinot Noir or a really nice village level Burgundy. For 10$ more or less you can get Chateau Malartic (Le Graviere for more, le sillage for less). You can get grgich hills wine, same grapes, better quality.   For whites you can be buying smaragd gruner veltliner, alsacian reisling and pinot gris, AMAZING california chardonnay or white burgundy, margret river chardonnay...etc etc  Do yourself a favor and next time you go to buy wines ask around for the best wine shop in town (who does a mixed case discount preferably), get a cart, and just grab a bunch of wines like the ones I mentioned above and you can try a new wine every night instead of drinking the same boring (and frankly overpriced) wines you're drinking now.   Final thought: I couldn't help but notice you're a lawyer. I work in the restaurant industry and I love lawyers. You guys spend a ton of money, tip appropriately and are typically very down to earth. Wine knowledge for you guys/gals is important. I've never seen a group of lawyers shut up and pay attention quicker than when another lawyer knows a lot about wine and starts explaining.

wine,388oxz,kidhumbeats,7,Tue Jun 2 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of decent Syrah from California that you would probably really enjoy. Qupe is a well know brand you might really like. It is lower acid and full of lovely red fruit flavors.   I'll also make a small suggestion for you to enjoy your wines more fully: as you drink wine, hold it in your mouth for longer before you swallow. You don't have to swish it around like a professional taster, just make sure it touches your whole mouth before you swallow. I find a lot of people who prefer very smooth or low acid wines tend to sip a little more quickly. The acids in wine tickle the mouth and give a very enjoyable texture, and harsh tannin (which is the chemical that causes the puckering sensation with some red wines) is harsher when you only feel it in the back of the throat. Taking your time with the wine in your mouth will mellow those sensations and give a more full tasting experience.   Also, holding even very smooth or fruity wines in the mouth a little longer will condition you to the sensation of acid and tannin, and soon you will have an easier time with more astringent varietals.

A quality winemaker in Burgundy will produce great wines in good and bad vintages and across all quality levels.

While Bruno Clavelier's wine are pretty distinctive from vineyard to vineyard and as you step up in quality you definitely feel like you're getting a better wine.  This is a good book to become acquainted with some of the most highly regarded winemakers of the region (also some very expensive wines).  A great way to hone in on your preference for a specific producer is if Large tastings are offered in your area (although, I'm not sure this happens anywhere but on the coasts), this way you can try a number of wines from different producers and decide how you feel about each.

Consider trying some 'aux cras' from 'clavelier' wine maker ( not the seller, uh ? They're all cousins :D ). This wine gonna be a hit in the next decade. ( and all the clavelier, imo ).

For example, Leroy decided that their 2004 grand crus weren't worthy of the name so they blended all of them and sold the bottles as basic Bourgogne.  But I agree with you.

I suspect it is nothing like the big Tannats he makes in Madiran, but it's almost certainly well-made. Not sure it will stand up to Cassoulet, but worth sampling a glass, anyway."

As for the markup, unfortunately living in Canada booze of any kind is taxed to death and far more expensive than the US. Two quick searches (Marechal and L'oratoire CdP) are almost exactly 2x retail at BC Liquor stores.   What would you say is an average markup for a not-so casual bistro?

wine,384s3a,theultrayik,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:29:39 2015 UTC,That's nonsense. Majority of fruit in WA doesn't go to small scale or boutique wineries. Most fruit goes to Ste Michelle. What large scale operations like Gallo bring to growers are options on who they can contract fruit with.
wine,384s3a,Iamfarmer,3,Tue Jun 2 01:39:55 2015 UTC,"Even CSM's cheapest wines don't come down to the level of Gallo's jug wines.  At worst, they make good budget wines, and some of their nicer stuff is fantastic.  Also, if Washington gets to be a popular spot, it's also more likely to fall victim to trends (aka, shit), and our wineries are more likely to be bought by big companies.  Look at Washington beer.  Our craft scene got too popular, and now Anheuser-Busch is buying up craft breweries (R.I.P. Elysian).  Edit: How could I forget!  It could also drive up prices and turn our rustic wine country into a tourist trap."
wine,384s3a,theultrayik,2,Tue Jun 2 02:44:46 2015 UTC,"It has a long way to go before turning into full-blown Napa. Two things though:   1) People already know WA has good wines, there's no putting the stopper back on that bottle.  2) If you actually like these wineries and think they have good products, it's in your interest for them to be successful. Will some be bought by the big conglomerates? Sure. But a lot will retain the quality that makes the wine great, which by the way isn't cheap. When it comes to people buying wine or considering a general area to be quality, having the perception that Washington is building helps ALL the wineries, not just the ones that will inevitably be sold for lots of money. Consistent quality, other than terroir, means lower yields, hand inspection, chemical analysis, canopy and vine management, possibly more workers to pay, and all sorts of things that are easier to do when money is coming in.  And by the way Gallo is a gigantic company, of course their lowest quality stuff is terrible. But if you think CSM doesn't make crap low-end wine just because Gallo jugs are worse, then you're kidding yourself."

It's probably oxidized as hell and will most likely be nutty flavored vinegar, but open it up and see how it tastes. Might need to decant off some of the sediment."
wine,384fr9,andtheodor,2,Mon Jun 1 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"Since you are curious, they ask for a few reasons. Primarily because if it is stored improperly (anywhere not cool/dark is usually a bad spot) and standing up. If you stand the wine up rather than lay it down, the cork can dry and shrink, allowing air to enter and the volatile alcohol to possibly evaporate. Also depending on the alcohol content, certain wines have a shorter shelf life. But almost always I say go for it."

Life's too short to feel guilty about drinking good wine.  Not wanting to drink a bottle of wine because you won't appreciate it fully is a little bit like not wanting to read Ulysses because you won't appreciate it fully. And yeah, you probably won't get as much out of that book as, say, a professor of English Literature, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it if you're interested."
wine,385ovn,caseyjosephine,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:43:53 2015 UTC,"No.   Though of note - it looks like your label is slightly different than the one pictured here on cellartracker.  Yours doesn't have the varietals listed below the year - which i think says 2009 though the photo isn't real clear.  I don't know if there's any significance to that.  Anyway, while the bottle isn't terribly cheap, the reviews are mediocre.  I'd recommend giving it at least a 90 minute decant. Reading the CT reviews will give you an idea of flavors that others have noted."

wine,385ovn,CorkTaint,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:01:46 2015 UTC,"Some history about my pallet, Never been huge on wine. I even grew up with my mother working for San Saba and now Wrath after the label change. I enjoyed San Saba's products and Wrath's even more so. That being said, I primarily drink bourbon and adore cognac. However, one of my mothers friends gave me this bottle and it sounds very nice.   I am afraid of not fully appreciating it. I prefer red wines but have no compunction against drinking yellow tail or even barefoot, they go down easy and have a wonderful red flavor even though they lack complexity. I think the only white I have ever enjoyed was a muscat blanc (sp?) from wrath and white haven a Sauvignon Blanc.   Should I spend some time diving in to different wines before trying this bottle?

wine,382qj5,CondorKhan,3,Mon Jun 1 12:54:52 2015 UTC,"Found a new independent store local to me and saw that they carry a bunch of fringe stuff for decent prices, so I decided to pick up this 2013 Jean Perrier et Fils Savoie Abymes “Cuvee Gastronomie” for a very fair price.  This is the first time trying the grape variety Jaquere, but not the first time trying Savoie wine (previously tried Bugey Cerdon, a sparkling semi-sweet red wine based on Gamay and Ploussard). I’ve read that these wines have an “alpine” quality, which seems to me like something you would “detect” because you know that this comes from the Alps. But it somewhat makes sense.. there’s a piney, resiny quality to it.   Removing the artificial cork produces a loud pop of escaping gases. The wine itself has a slight fizziness, much like a young Muscadet or Gruner. It pours a pale greenish yellow. Fresh aroma of pears and green apple. On the palate, big pear taste. Possibly the most pear-like wine I’ve had. Some green apple, pine and minerals. Finish is super dry and crisp, like tonic water. Comes in quite light at 11.5%.  It’s called “Cuvee Gastronomie” which basically tells you to drink it with food, so I whipped up some pesto pasta with serrano ham and grilled asparagus. It was a prefect match, the piney qualities being a great match for the asparagus particularly.   It’s definitely a nice wine, and it’s definitely meant for gulping on a hot summer afternoon, despite its cold weather origins."

wine,383flo,unclefire,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:36:33 2015 UTC,"We stayed at the place below a couple of years ago.  It was a great place.  A family owned vineyard and olive place whose family apartments were converted to agriturismo.   I think there's maybe a dozen apartments/rooms.   Great grounds and accomodations.   Scenery is fantastic.  It is a bit rustic but nice and clean.  Had a kitchen, multiple baths, tennis courts, pool.    It was close to the town of Montespertoli which makes has a market, laundry and other stuff for supplies and restaurants.  In ""supermarket"" market I bought some food and wine for dinner one night.  It was a fantastic local organic wine and paid like 3 EUR for it (I tried it on a whim when I saw the price and what it was).   As part of your stay, this place will give you one or two bottles of their own wine (white + red) + their olive oil.   They also have a weekly dinner made by them by reservation only.  It is a multi course family style meal with unlimited wine/food and a different wine for each course.  At the end they served vinsanto and I think grapa was on hand too.   About a mile down the road is another tiny town (if you want to call it that).   There are two resturants there which had fantastic food.  One was called ""Osteria dell'Ignorante""  (Osteria of the Ignorant one).  The owner was hilarious.   The other one was called ""Era Una Volta"" (There was a Time)  Great place-- I'd go there again in a heart beat. http://www.lepianore.com/  We did wine tasting at the place below (which was near where we stayed).  They also had rooms and apartments plus an on site restaurant. http://www.tenutadisticciano.it/  Both places are reasonable driving distances to Florence, Pisa, San Gimignano and other places in that area.  If you're into agriturismo there are plenty of places in Tuscany.  There are certainly hotels and stuff in the cities, but staying out in a vineyard is a totally different experience.  Unless you're staying in one of the bigger cities getting around w/out a car will be a pain.  I'm pretty sure you can do bus/van type tours for wine etc."

The current wholesale COST of the item is $60US. That's the laid-in U.S. cost from the winery to a distributor. To be generous, we can say that shipping per bottle is $5, and taxes are only $.26 (generous again), so the actual value of the bottle leaving the winery is $54.74 US, or 50 Euro."
wine,383l4u,andtheodor,3,Mon Jun 1 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's suspicious, it's probably just a store with poor inventory management and that's what it cost when they originally bought it.

wine,383l4u,andtheodor,2,Mon Jun 1 18:21:35 2015 UTC,"I doubt they bought it on futures either, but 39 Euro probably reflects what was originally paid for it and the fact that it's been sitting around a supermarket for 5+ years. I wouldn't hesitate to try one if I was interested."

wine,381cjf,LeepaTime,3,Mon Jun 1 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"shows the region and 2012 vintage very well. ripe, rich, but not overdone. stands out at the $20-25 price point.   nose of leafy blackberry, cool cassis, and cocoa powder. whiff of oak and graphite minerality. deep but straightforward.   full body and enough acid structurally. dusty tannin leads to a long finish with surprising grip considering the ripe fruit.   palate of black fruit preserves, creamy dark and white chocolate, charred oak, tangy river stone, and pine sap. touch of seasoned salt on the finish makes this the perfect steak wine.   a bit boring on opening, but the Roth develops into a textbook Cabernet for this 2012 vintage. Big, yet restrained with the oak. succulent but not overripe.   drink now through 2020. Very competitive at this price point."

The vast majority of wines are made for more or less immediate consumption and won't really get better with age. Aside from the Stag's Leap and the Sausal (and possibly the Peynaud Bordeaux, though I'm not familiar with it) are probably the best of the bunch. I'm guessing the old Fetzer is unfortunately dead by now, unless it's been stored well. I'd love to taste it, though.  Here's what I'd do: invite a bunch of friends over for dinner and have a little blind tasting: put the bottles in bags, number each one, have everyone vote on their favorites, and then do a big unveiling. Fun, possibly delicious, possibly gross, but fun."

wine,37zjez,CondorKhan,5,Sun May 31 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"Based on the Pinots that you said you like, I would recommend Banshee Pinot Noirs. Their basic Sonoma County goes for like $25.00, and it's a nice, richer style. I also find them to be pretty well-made Pinots for the price.  For the best $15 Pinot that is the style you like, look for the Pinot Project Pinot Noir. It's really good for everyday drinking"
wine,37zjez,heavyhandedpour,2,Sun May 31 19:11:22 2015 UTC,I believe Ross Cobb of Hirsch and Cobb consults for them. Their rose of pinot noir is amazing for $10-12.

wine,37zjez,thewhits,3,Sun May 31 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"Two off the top:  Philippe Gavignet Bourgogne Rouge 2013 goes for around $25 and is meant for early drinking--like right now. All fruit from the Côte de Nuits, and an excellent introduction to the region (Côte de Nuits is not an Appellation).  Michel Sarrazin Bourgogne Rouge 2013 even a little bit less, but still needs maybe another year in the bottle. Mostly fruit from the  Côte Chalonnaise (southern end of Burgundy).  And one Oregonian: Ayres Willamette Valley 2013 is around $30 and showing very well right now. Not sure, but I think all or most all of the fruit is from the Ribbon Ridge area."
wine,37zjez,winemule,1 point,Sun May 31 20:18:53 2015 UTC,I had assumed that Burgundy was out of reach because most of the time when I see one mentioned it's pretty expensive. Thanks for the tips.
wine,37zjez,dardar1829,3,Mon Jun 1 02:27:28 2015 UTC,"I think Oregon Pinot Noir is some of the best wine out there. I recommend Cameron Pinot Noir or Bethel Heights. Brickhouse has some amazing stuff and they're certified biodynamic, but I cant remember if their stuff goes for under 30 bucks."
wine,37zjez,wineandseams,2,Sun May 31 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"I second this. Oregon Pinot has such a fantastic sense of place and is incredible value as far as that variety goes. A few of my favourites are bethel heights, purple hands and brooks."

wine,37zjez,concentration_cramps,2,Mon Jun 1 22:51:05 2015 UTC,I would recommend trying AtoZ Pinot at around 20$ it fits your described profile quite well.   The best 30ish Pinot imho is the Melville Santa Rita Hills but it will be more extracted and fruit focused.

This bottle may have been produced before Constellation purchased the label.  Back in the day, they were one of the better producers in New York State.

wine,37uo55,CondorKhan,6,Sat May 30 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"Zind-Humbrecht tasting in my local independent store. Obviously I can’t miss this.  For those who don’t know, Zind-Humbrecht is arguably the top domaine in Alsace, along with Trimbach. While Trimbach is known for their steely, austere wines, Zind-Humbrecht is known for their old oak fermented, voluptuous wines. Their policy of non-interventionism means that the wines are as they come, which means huge variations in sugar levels from vintage to vintage. To aid the consumer, ZH has established a dryness scale that goes from 1 to 5, with 1 being bone dry to 5 being highly sweet. This number is noted on all labels.  2012 Zind This I reviewed at home a few weeks ago, and the notes still hold. I asked about the rep about the oxidative character, the official answer was something along the lines of “no, this is not oxidative! what you are tasting is terroir!”, the store owner, however, agreed with me that this has some of the Jura character. What I can conclude without the shadow of a doubt, is that it showed here and at home a few weeks ago exactly how Olivier Humbrecht intended.  2012 Herrenweg Riesling From 46 year old vines in a warm microclimate. Aged on lees on old oak for 18 months. Pours pale yellow. Intensely aromatic. I detected a good amount of petrol just as the rep was saying “you will note that this has no petrol!”. Loads of stone fruit flavors, with a fairly heavy body. Crisp minerality on the finish, which is dry dry dry. This is a 1 on the ZH dryness scale. Clearly a Riesling from a superior site.  2012 Goldert Grand Cru Muscat From the Goldert Grand Cru, a late ripening site with limestone soils. Pours golden yellow. Incredible Muscat nose of orange zest, flowers, honeysuckle and musk. On the palate, citrus rind, peach, blood orange. Has a slight fizziness to it. Finish is dry as it gets. I think this is also a 1 in the dryness scale. Vibrant and full of life. In the running for WOTN.  2012 Pinot Gris Calcaire From the Heimburg vineyard. Aroma of smoke and honey. On the palate, peaches, honey and a bit of almonds. Thick, round body. Finish is moderately acidic but less so than the other wines on the tasting. This one is one for the heavy sauces.  2013 Gewurztraminer From the warm Herrenweg site. Intense Gewurz aroma. It might be the most obviously lychee-like Gewurz I’ve had or it might be that I ate a bag of lychees 2 days ago. Flowers and peach on the nose as well. On the palate again more lychee and peach. Lots of body and power, this would beat Grand Crus of lesser producers (it’s also priced like one).  2011 Gewurztraminer Herrenweg de Turckheim Vielles Vignes Vendages Tardives Pours deep gold. Amazing aroma, even more intense than the regular Gewurz. Lychees, stone fruit, musk, flowers. The body achieves exactly what I want from dessert wines, power without weight. Intense flavors of overripe peach, lychees. Plenty of acid in the finish to balance out the sugary sweetness. An outrageous wine and possibly WOTN.  Kinda bummed out they didn’t bring out the Clos Windsbuhls and the Rangen de Thanns, but a fantastic tasting nonetheless. The Goldert came home with me, being that it’s excellent and as rare as a hen’s tooth."

I thought they were only Chardonnay or Aligoté. Woops...  So this is Dampt Saint-Bris Sauvignon Blanc from 2012.   It poured very very pale. Took a little time to open up as well. The nose was quite promising at first, very fruity. On the first sip, it ended up being very mineral and extremely acidic, not as pleasant as the nose had promised it would be.  Gave it a bit of time to open up, and it turned out to be very fruity, notes of passion fruit.   Unlike New Zealand Sauv Blanc, it wasn't grassy. It was a mix between mineral and fruity. It retained this high acidity that I look for in Sauv Blanc personally. Perfect summer wine. This was not paired with anything, it was opened up as an aperitif, before lunch. A perfect sipper.   I liked this a lot actually. It's a style of Sauv Blanc I hadn't experienced a lot before. It's worth a try.   I wish you fine folks a great weekend."

It is a white wine that is slightly sweet. I remember some bubbles, but not enough to call it sparkling. The label was a whimsical mosaic type picture of a man/person drinking wine on a yellow background. The outline of the label was blue.   It was relatively cheap at the time (<$20/bottle). But I cannot remember the name or the type of wine that it was.   I found this wine while studying in Italy. It brings up lots of good memories. I have been looking for this bottle ever since I got back. I cant believe I never took a better photo of the bottle, but this was before camera phones were anywhere. I would truly appreciate the help identifying the bottle."

wine,37wcp8,6119,7,Sat May 30 23:11:14 2015 UTC,"If you're giving Champagne to people who really know their wine, I would avoid most of the wines that can be bought from a big box store (i.e., Veuve Clicquot, Moët Chandon, Perrier Jouët, Nicolas Feuillatte).  Go to your local wine store and ask for ""Grower Champagne""; these are wines made by guys who actually grow their own grapes, so they're invested in every step of the winemaking process. These are some of the finest, most meticulous artisans out there, and at the same time they are humble farmers with a very deep connection to their land. To my taste, the wines are better and more distinctive than the big producers listed above. Though their production is much smaller, the wines stay generally in the same price range.  If you don't have a store that can help you, the label on a bottle of Champagne can help you find out who's a grower and who buys their grapes from contractors. Look for the letters RM followed by a series of numbers (this is often in tiny lettering at the edge of a label). For example, one of my favorite producers, Champagne Guy Larmandier, is registered RM-26751-01, which appears at the bottom of the label. RM stands for récoltant manipulant; producers who purchase grapes are registered as NM, for négoçiant manipulant.  tl;dr If your friends are really into wine, buy a grower Champagne like Guy Larmandier, Francis Boulard, Cédric Bouchard, Pierre Peters, or Tarlant. If your friends are brand chasers, bite the bullet and buy them a bottle of Cristal, because the label will matter more than the wine inside."

wine,37se7g,sourcenyne,7,Sat May 30 03:05:03 2015 UTC,"Although it's early, Happy Birthday!  I think that generally speaking, white wine is more approachable, especially if you like things on the sweeter side and if you like moscato. A few white varietals that are accessible and often made in an off-dry, semi-dry, or sweet style would be riesling, gewurtztraminer, and sauvignon blanc.  If you're just starting out in wine, I don't think that it's really worth your money to sink cash into really nice vintages or well-known wineries. Personally, I don't think I really appreciate the complexities as much as someone who has tasted a lot of wine would. I can taste the differences in a side by side but wouldn't necessarily prefer the more expensive wine.  If you're willing to try to branch out past sweet wine, I think bubbly or kinda crisp, tart wine is a good place to go. Cava and prosecco are bubbly wine styles from Spain and Italy, respectively. Vinho Verde is made from underripe grapes so it's low in alcohol, not usually sweet, but is usually kinda crisp and refreshing. There's also lots of cheap vinho verde for the college-kid budget ;) I really like it in the summer, chilled, especially with grilled food.  I hope you have a great birthday! :)"

wine,37se7g,sourcenyne,0,Sat May 30 03:06:59 2015 UTC,Sauv Blanc can be fruity but it is rare to find one that is sweet.   Sweet means there is residual sugar present.

wine,37qpog,MuzzyIsMe,2,Fri May 29 23:44:03 2015 UTC,"That's a ridiculous comment. Vivino and its like are perfect for the situation you just described at the supermarket. Sure there is getting recommendations from people when you're planning ahead of time to buy wine, but if you find yourself in the shop and fancy picking up a bottle, you're hardly going to have a wine professional on speed dial or shopping with you, just in case you've got a wine query.    It's no different from looking anything else up on the web when faced with a choice and you want a second (or third etc) opinion. Especially if it is an impulse buy."
wine,37qpog,dexcel,-2,Sat May 30 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Wine is way too subjective. What some people say is great, I might hate.  That's why I put no real value on wine critic ratings, either, unless I happen to find a critic whose taste closely aligns with my own.  You can't tell Vivino ""I like this type of wine, this is my budget, I'm eating this type of dish, the weather outside is like this"" etc. etc. How can the ratings possibly ever be relevant?  A big fruit bomb Zinfandel can score high on Vivino because that's what most people like, but it's not going to help me when I'm having oysters for dinner.  On the other hand, someone in my local wine shop can (or should be able to) pick a wine for me based on all those criteria.  Now, if you actually pore over the comments and study what people have to say about the wines on Vivino, you could glean some useful info.  That's not what happens in the store though.  People scan a bottle, and if it has a good rating they consider it.  If not, they move on.    I have some amazing wines that don't get especially good ratings on Vivino, because quite frankly, they aren't easy drinking or meant for an inexperienced palate.   I guess what I'm trying to say is a point based system is a really bad way to rate wine, and many other products that are based on subjective opinion.  If Vivino only provided reviews that you could read through, I'd have no problem with it.  As it is, too many people are swayed by a number that really means nothing."

wine,37lqzs,vinomenal,6,Thu May 28 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, I agree 100% that people should buy and drink what they enjoy. Wine isn't a test or a measure of one's value; if your jam is Sutter Home White Zin I'm stoked that you're happy! But I don't think that this is just about branding for millennials (who, btw, I don't think do counter-culture at all. Fuckers are all about inclusion and anti-bullying).  But I was in Sonoma last week and had an internal dialogue nearly identical to this from one from the article:   Like other Rhone wines, it impressed him less with its fruit flavor than with its hints at things that couldn’t possibly be in the wine: roasted meat, freshly turned soil. He liked how the wine felt in his mouth, crisp rather than weighty, and how the wine evolved as he drank it, one sip after the next. These, he knew, were hallmarks of bottlings from the finest regions of Europe. When he wondered aloud why similar wines weren’t made in California, the other sommelier said it simply wasn’t possible.  “That stuck in my head,” Parr says. “California is a big place. How was it not possible?”   I buy and enjoy plenty of wine here in CA. But I think it's fair to say that much of what's made-- at least in Northern CA-- is made to a familiar style and somewhat similar. I have 0 problem with a collective of wine makers trying to change expectations. Fuck, without people at least pretending to be iconoclasts the last 3 decades would've left us with nothing but KJ-style Merlot, Butter-bomb Chardonnay and the 16% Zinns currently exciting the market.  Again, for anyone who enjoys those styles I'm excited for you! I also like enjoying things, so I totally feel you! But I'm happy to see people appealing to the minorities and maybe trying to change the attitudes of the majorities."

Raj and the IPOB group are kind of a counter-culture like vinomeal said, but I understand why they created the group. The majority of California produces wines in the Parker style. They are trying to show that the state can do more than that. Sometimes they may poopoo on Parker too much, but I like what they are trying to do, which is to focus on terroir and produce food friendly wines."

There's a philosophy about wine, a certain way it speaks to us, like art or love - unless you disagree with me, then you hate good things.  In the Old World, you're only allowed to make a certain varietal or blend of grapes based on where you are, at least if you want to join the club.  Now it seems the old guard in the new world would benefit from such laws - minimum alcohol, brix. And it needs to taste the same as it did last year too.

The guy is incredibly passionate about wine and a sincerely genuine and nice guy.  I think the misconception comes from him being passionate and a hard worker. He wants to have his hand in everything in a good way, to further his understanding of wine and get the wines that he likes to drink out to the public.  He doesn't seem to want to reinvent the wheel. He is simply drawing attention to the more restrained styles of wine he and the IPOB crew produce which are certainly overshadowed by the traditional CA style."

wine,37lqzs,arnaudh,14,Thu May 28 20:16:54 2015 UTC,"I get it, but that's also what annoys me a bit.  Here's the thing: I'm French. I love French wine. I like Pinots who smell like a barn covered with horseshit. I like the structure and greenness of a young Bordeaux. I like the dirt in my Rhône reds. I love those bone-dry Condrieux.  But I also love California wine. Good California wine. The style doesn't matter, as long as it's good.  I'm also annoyed by the stupid generalizations those people make all the time. Like all those California wines Parker loved are fruit bombs? Oh yeah, you know what's a fruit bomb? A young Pomerol. A Gigondas. Pretty much everything Southwestern France grows - the largest wine-producing and exporting area in that country.  And again, there has been European-influenced wine produced in California for decades. Dry Rieslings. Deeply structured Cabs. Poopy-smelling Pinots.  Do your own thing, California. Find your style. Find your tradition. The great thing is, everyone here can do whatever the fuck they want, unlike in the Old Country, where laws regulate in the most granular way how you make your wine or what you can grow. Emulating wines from another region can be a way to find direction, but it's not something you can do anywhere.  Similarly, I fucking hate those neo-Tuscan tasting rooms everywhere. I mean, Chateau Montelena is pretty. They got rid of the Disneyesque schlock. It's got personality now, and history. But those wineries that try to get that European, Old World cachet? Get the fuck out. This is California. You've got street cred in the wine world already. Don't try to be French, or German, or Italian. Be yourself. You're in ranching country, so build or restore a tasting room that looks like a goddamn California barn. Or a ranchhouse. Or a stagecoach stop. That's what it is. That's your identity. Argh. I'm ranting.  So people should do whatever they want, as long as they don't take giant dumps on those who do otherwise and yet are still obviously successful. The consumers will decide."

A young Pomerol. A Gigondas. Pretty much everything Southwestern France grows - the largest wine-producing and exporting area in that country.   Not sure what point you are trying to make. I don't think people think CA is the only place that makes fruit-forward wines. Parker likes wines in other warm regions too, and some producers in thoe areas certainly changed thier style to be a bit more along the lines of what Parker looked for.   Do your own thing, California. Find your style. Find your tradition.   This is what I am most interested in, people planting non-Cab, Chard, Pinots and trying to find what does best in their area. They also tend to be cheaper which is nice for my wallet. CA is such a young region and I dont think we have found all of the best terroir-to-variety pairings."

But it's not - as you point out - it's the only region doing that.  I think it's awesome that so many regions are finally figuring out what does well in particular regions. Instead of planting Cab or Pinot where it doesn't belong. California is still young and there is still so much to figure out. But styles are emerging in particular region - terroir, essentially.

It's like going to the movies with nothing known: no title, no trailer, no reviews: just a movie.  It could be good, but it could be complete waste of time and money.  The review system to me is just a guide that a wine should be pretty good.  The rest is up to my palette.  Would I buy a wine that rated 70 points? Probably not.  Neither does a 90 score mean I'm going to love it, it just means it's not going to be a complete piece of shit wine.  Ratings help consumers, but if I see a bottle of BV that got 85 points or something,  that's also not going to turn me off because I love those wines out of Rutherford.    This Parr sounds like his main goal is to shit on Parker and promote himself.  I say drink the wines you like.

I do not think anybody is against reviews, but as the article points out Parker has made a handful of wineries famous essentially for appeasing who else but Parker which is fine except for the fact that Parker and wine advocate seem to like blends and big fruit bombs that Parr's style of winemaking does not produce by design."

However, sweet wines will generally be the majority, at least for now, of what will come out of NY due to the cold long winters and shorten, fairly temperate summers. Plus the young, glacial till soils make it different."

wine,37mz70,instantkarmagonnaget,1 point,Fri May 29 13:40:14 2015 UTC,"To add to what has already been posted:  The further north you go, the less sunlight there is to ripen the grapes. Days are shorter, light is less intense. In order to ripen the grapes have to stay on the vine longer. This takes them into colder weather. Without the requisite sunlight and long days, cab sauv or grenade (For instance) cannot create enough sugar and convert malic acid to properly ripen. The grape will not be balanced and will not be capable of creating quality wine. As you mentioned, the pH will be too low.  Riesling, on the other hand, is naturally balanced at high acid levels and the fruit will get ripe enought in cold weather, provided it does not get too cold and there is enough sunlight. The finger lakes are very similar to thE mosel in germany. Vines are planted facing south to maximize sunlight.  The mosel river and the finger lakes moderate the temperature and keep the vineyards warmer, reflect critical sunlight onto the vines,  and also help protect the vines from frost (which can ruin a crop).  Add for terrior... That really has nothing to do with this discussion terrior is a sense of place or a typicity that is consistent in a vineyard. It can be picked out of a lineup and is unique, similar to an accent in language. Meursault has a broadness and oaty/mealy quality that is different than puligny montrachet which is not as broad, is leaner and has more racy acidity. The vast majority of wines from these two villages typically taste this way. It takes an exceptionally skilled winemaker to allow terrior to show in his wines much like it takes a skilled and exceptional musician to make their voice or instrument really move you. Miles Davis played a horn as did countless other horn players buy no one sounded like him. Terrior is elusive and rarE and a treat to find. Typical is different and happens on a much broader scale   *edit for spell check errors"

Just like in the mosel, I would imagine that the vineyards that have the most southerly aspect will be of higher quality. While the lakes run NS, having the vineyards as s, se, or sw as possible is likely   with the right soil, vineyards with the most southerly orientation will produce better grapes.igrapes.im sure there a some note able exceptions in the finger lake just there there are in every wine region."

wine,37mz70,instantkarmagonnaget,0,Sat May 30 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"FYI - sorry but I think you are a bit confused or maybe you are also speaking in general terms. Riesling is normally considered an early ripening variety. in warm climates it ripen too quickly and early And suffers from a lack of complexity. Riesling, in cooler climates like we are discussing, in new York and in the mosel,  it needs the sunniest, most protected sites, ssteeper angles and the help of large water bodies. Only in coover climates is it a late ripener and just happens to produce it's highest quality wines when it ripens late.  its easy to make little mistakes when posting a quick response here via your phone."
wine,37mz70,Le_Grand_Fromage,3,Sun May 31 03:07:40 2015 UTC,"Wow. You really have no idea what you are talking about. I'm not here to make you sound dumb or anything, but ITT you sound like a tool soapboxing a spew of misinformation.   Agronomically speaking Riesling is slow to mature. It experiences flowering and veraison not particularly late, but from there is late to actually ripen (flavor up). Yes, ripeness is highly subjective. Nobody with any type of viticulture background would call Riesling early. Go farm Riesling or open up any agronomic text on vines and read about it for yourself.  Grow it in a warm climate and, among other things, it wont have any flavor until the sugar is through the roof and the acid has dropped out. A cool climate allows sugar to accumulate slowly in balance with ripening.   Hope that is clear enough for you.  Posting from the Mosel where there are plenty of vineyards planted away from water bodies- and even some on north facing slopes."
wine,37mz70,instantkarmagonnaget,0,Sun May 31 09:27:16 2015 UTC,"Lol. Soapbox, eh?  You just made a mistake and stated something that was not a completely accurate. Your statement was not properly qualified. You are quick to call out others in the same situation. Technically, riesling tends to ripen early. Go back and visit your Jancis and Oz. As I said, it will not produce high quality wine if it ripens early. Yes, it needs coaxing to ripen late and produce outstanding wines. You repeat what I already said. Sure there are vineyards away from rivers but the highest quality are along certain spots on the river. Surely you understand this.  You are one of more belligerent and opinionated people I have seen on this sub reddit who seems to prefer arguing over discourse, quick to name call and sound righteous. Fortunately, personalities like you are in the minority here.  you haven't offered anything to contribute to OP's post or any useful contribution to this thread and are trolling."
wine,37mz70,Le_Grand_Fromage,2,Sun May 31 13:03:38 2015 UTC,"What mistake did I make? I'm not trying to be belligerent, i'm not trolling, and I'm not that opinionated and have very little ego. I just really don't like misinformation- which is what you have provided in spades. We can have a discourse, but there is no point in doing that with misinformation and gross generalization, which are the only things you have really provided so far. I don't know where your information is coming from or why you are so stubborn to stick to your factual errors, misunderstandings, and generalizations. It really sounds like you are regurgitating information you have heard at one point in time, without applying any form of critical thinking or analysis- much less any actual experience with the subject.   Jancis and Oz are not agronomic resources, they are not experts in the subject, they are wine marketers and promoters. To suggest them as sources in this topic is humorous. They don't farm grapes, they don't plan and design vineyards, and nobody comes to them for questions about what is happening (and why) in their vineyard. Their writings aren't taught in formal education and are actually advised to be avoided (wine writers in general, not them specifically) as they are common sources of poor conventional wisdom and erroneous misinformation. They are puppets for the wine trade. Nobody that spends time in vineyards gives a damn about who they are or what they have to say- unless of course they are promoting that individuals wine. I've met and enjoyed a glass with both of them, they are both nice and important people in this industry, but I've never bothered to read anything they have written more than a blog post. I take my knowledge from the large international network of practitioners, consultants, academics, and scientists I am fortunate enough to call colleagues.   Back to the subject of Riesling's ripening patterns. Like I said before, look into any agronomic text on viticulture- if you are really interested there is a whole sub-field of penology and maturity modeling that uses globally fed climate and agronomic data.  And FWIW, everything else aside, wikipedia is on my side.   All of the vineyards of saar and ruwer (tributaries of the mosel) are far away from anything that could be called a large body of water- including the mosel's ""most well known"" vineyard Scharzhofberger."
wine,37mz70,instantkarmagonnaget,0,Sun May 31 18:55:14 2015 UTC,"Look man, you were trolling and belligerent in your tone. There was no discussion or questI on in on your part. The OP asked a question and was looking for a general answer. Degree days are shorter in cool northerly climates like NY. This makes it hard to ripen many grapes. Riesling does well in theSe climate provided it has the proper conditions. If not in these conditions it will ripen quickly and early.   The mosel, many would argue, is higher quality (in general) than ruwer or saar.  Bottles used to have Mosel-Ruwer-Saar on the label but now it is just Mosel. guess mosel wanted to go solo. And which is the best known vinear is pretty subjective. I would say piesporter if not just because of the bastardization. A dozen of vineyards could be best known.  Sounds like you might be well educated in viti. You could give a scientific detailed and extensive answer to the OP'S question (which you never atttempted) but what he/ssee was looking for was a general layman's answer.   There are plenty of books that one can read (like Oz and Jancis) to get a working understanding of viti and vini. I haven't the time (at the moment) to Read anything deeper than wines and vines and the occasion tech paper from journal of vine.   You should read Jancis and Oz before you condemn them. It is not very astute from a science perspective. You are making broad generalizations again by doing this. They are not Parker or Spectator. I have met many with the narrow view that all big wines are bad and journalists are puppets. That is the most unscientific statement.  At this point, I am fine to agree to disagree. I wish you the best and many bountiful harvests."

I imagine one could have some interesting results with gamay. Most vinifera reds will not ripen in that climate. I would be interested to try Pinot and CF from finger lake to see how they compare to Loire reds. CF probably is the best red to pursue in that region. With enough experimenting with ways to control its vigor and tweaks to help it ripen better (mostly trellis and canpoy management). CF might be kind of a hard variety for a region to hang its hat on.   Is there much distribution of reds outside of NY and close proximity?

wine,37mz70,splashtonkutcher,0,Fri May 29 05:01:38 2015 UTC,"white wines are often more about the crisp acidity and freshness / purity of flavor, while reds are more often about phenolic ripeness and deep flavors - the former is achieved with enough sun while keeping temps low, while the latter is more about having tons of sun and plenty of heat during the day while keeping nights cool to keep acidity in balance.    remember it's a business and producers will produce wines that sell - well, very ripe californian wines have been preferred by major critics and casual drinkers alike, while the niagara region is famous for its high quality icewine (vidal or cabernet franc).  it would take a very rich, brave, or very stupid (usually 2 of the 3) estate owner to grow grapes and make wines that fall outside the typical ones from the region.  can you grow syrah or cabernet sauvignon in upstate new york?  sure, but the flavor profile will be different than what people expect from typical examples of those wines, which means sales will likely struggle outside of local distribution from tasting room activity.    and don't apologize for the question, you seem like the kind of person that could really get into fine wine and the whole subculture behind it, probably exactly the kind of person the pros in this sub would love to talk with."
wine,37mz70,ArsenalZT,-1,Fri May 29 11:46:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know too much about the east coast, but I believe its because of the extreme climate. You get heavy snow that could freeze the grapes, concentrating sugars and throwing off balance. Then you have really hot weather that late in the season will cause grapes to over ripen, where I think you'll end up with way too much alcohol.  There are some places I've read on the east coast that can do OK because they have a microclimate that protects them from extremes, although I can't name any of the top of my head. I do know the Niagra area is kind of known for sweet wines, so cold temperatures are a plus.  Part it is also the grapes grown. Native grapes like Concord are more resilient, where as well known varietals like Cab Sauv and Pinot Noir are more susceptible to extreme weather."
wine,37mz70,nmott,2,Fri May 29 04:04:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how any wines around here could be described as having too much alcohol. Whites tend to hover around 11 percent, while reds sit at about 12 percent, at least in my experience. That's pretty low.  Snow also doesn't tend to freeze the grapes -- they're harvested long before that would be an issue. It actually provides insulation for the dormant vines and helps protect them from the cold and the winds.  You're dead on with Cab Sauv. It struggles to ripen, at least in the Finger Lakes, and often tastes ""green."" Pinot does fairly well, though, especially considering its reputation for being quite a fickle grape."

wine,37luvm,undergroundaleroad,5,Fri May 29 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"Evaporation in wine is largely due to water and ethanol loss, along with minute quantities of volatile compounds which we will ignore for the sake of time, discussion, and context.  It is a long, slow chemical process which has no effect on letting a wine breath.  Evaporation of water and ethanol is directly related to temperature and relative humidity (RH).  The higher the temperature, the higher the rate of evaporation of water and ethanol.  The rate of water evaporation will decrease up to 100% RH, where the rate of condensation is equal to evaporation.    Evaporative loss can be calculated using the following equation (Blazer 1991, Block and Boulton);  Evaporative loss in mL / month = 180 * VPw * (1-RH/100)  where VPw is the vapor pressure of water at a given temperature (°C) and RH is the relative humidity.  Ethanol loss is calculated using its own vapor pressure but I believe I can get the point across using just water.  Let's say /u/AshtonC1985 wants to open a new bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon for dinner tonight and decides to let it sit for 24 hours prior to serving.  We'll assume the kitchen is a comfortable 20 °C (68 °F) with a relative humidity of 60%.    We can then refer to this psychometric chart to determine VPw.  At 20 °C and a relative humidity of 60%, our VPw appears to be around 10 mm Hg.    Thus;  180 * 10 mm Hg * (1-60/100) = 720 mL / month.  Divide by 30 days and we get 24 mL / day.    24 mL of wine is 3.2% of the bottle by volume and even that strikes me as too high.  Although ethanol may have a higher evaporation rate than water, the majority of that 3.2% is still water simply due to their relative proportions in wine.  I would estimate a mere 0.5 of the 3.2% is ethanol.  That comes out to roughly 4-5 mL of ethanol per day.    If /u/AshtonC1985 wanted to evaporate a whole 1% of alcohol by volume then the wine would evaporate entirely before they even get close.  But what do I know, I'm just a wine chemist.

A $20 tasting from Silver Oak was considered very high.  But now there are tastings up to $100 for a few pours and barely anybody has coupons.  But at least Sonoma has quite a few for people."

But to me (and this is just my opinion) some of these 'natural' techniques seem to mask and obscure terroir/varietal expression. And so the marketing and selling of the wine becomes more about a winemaking technique (or otherwise skipping a step in the traditional winemaking methods), than expressing a place or a grape through a wine.  Especially when seeing an article like this, which is otherwise well written, use persuasive rhetoric in attributing more 'honest' and 'authentic' descriptions to this sort of vinification.   These descriptions are the soapbox upon which 'natural winemakers' stand to make themselves feel more superior to everyone else, and that's why the word 'hipster' in this context is apt.  This category of wine remains relevant only to a niche market of special snowflakes in the wine world: those who come in to the winemaking industry not to learn anything, not to express a variety or a place and a time through their wine, but solely to express an ideology."

Some geeks are discovering it and now that's all they talk about.  Here's why some folks are rolling their eyes about it: those wines are nice. And their price point is alright. But what used to be a well-kept secret (like Sancerre rouge, Jura wines, etc.) is now getting a ton of attention. And it's nice for the producers and importers. It really is. (I'm a huge Loire Valley fan.)  But the attention often turns into overhype. For the past two years I keep seeing pieces about it with clever hooks. Writers are discovering it and getting excited. Suddenly everybody wants to try it. Not a ton is produced, so in the U.S. it's not easy to find except in large cities, contributing to its cult status.  How great is pétillant naturel?

I have an extensive background in cooking, and I was already a pretty serious cigar aficionado.  But, picking out the notes in wine did take a little practice.  I definitely started out in that ""this tastes red"" phase.    One thing to keep in mind is that you shouldn't let other people tell you what you're tasting.  Get some good sniffs in, and then keep it in your mouth for a good long hold while you breathe slowly and let the wine do its thing (at list for the first couple sips).  Try and name your own aromas and flavors, then compare notes with other people afterwards.  Otherwise, you won't be training yourself to taste, you'll be training yourself to taste what others are saying."

wine,37iu3y,agtcool,1 point,Thu May 28 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"It takes a ton of practice. I and many people I know, who take blind tasting very seriously still struggle with it, but you gradually start to see improvement. I've found that doing it in a group with a grid is the best way. You need someone there to tell you when you're wrong and the grid helps to separate all of the various elements of assessing the wine.   Also if you want your wines to by typical and nuanced 15-25$ is a good price range to stick to. Yes it can be a lot, but if you're already spending 12$ you'd be surprised how much better the 17$ wine is on average."
wine,37iu3y,quixologist,1 point,Thu May 28 06:28:14 2015 UTC,"My two pieces of advice:  1.) Take your time when tasting.  Close your eyes.  I often drink with people who are more interested in other things than what the wine tastes like. It's great when I ignore them, get into my zone, block out the outside stimuli.  2.) Start smelling everything.  The more conscious your are about smelling things in the world around you, the easier it will be to identify and name smells.  As Tom Petty says, the naming is the hardest part."
wine,37hczc,Bacchus87,12,Wed May 27 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"I knew I enjoyed wine but I had no idea about it, and I got tired of going to restaurants and feeling like an idiot when confronted with a wine list.  So one day I was at the souvenir shop in Monticello and they were selling The Wine Bible so I decided to buy a copy. After a couple of weeks, I had a pretty good grasp of what the different regions were and what the major styles were so I began attending tastings and my local independent wine shop. Most of my tastes in wine were formed during those tastings.  Not a long time later, we took our first trip to France and decided to visit Alsace, and that's where I really got into it.   You have the advantage that you already liked Scotch ahead of time. Likewise I was (and still am) a craft beer nut before getting into wine. What that does is that you don't have to acquire the taste for dry beverages. People who only drink sweet drinks can never fully get into wine until they shed that idea. Lots of people post here thinking that they want to get into wine because they tried a Moscato and they liked it.. they're at a disadvantage.  So yeah, buy a book like The Wine Bible and go to as many tastings as possible. If you go to a restaurant that offers paired flights, choose it every time. If you can travel, visit a wine region and get to talk with winemakers and get a feel for the culture of the place and how the local wine and food fit into it. To me, a bottle of wine is a liquid time capsule, with a slice of a specific place and a specific time in delicious drinkable form. To me, that's a big part of the enjoyment."

wine,37hczc,unclefire,5,Wed May 27 23:14:56 2015 UTC,"1) Most importantly, stop buying wine at the supermarket. You simply will not find interesting wine at the grocery store at any price point (I’m sure there are some exceptions). Grocery store wines target people who don’t drink much wine, don’t care much about wine, and/or have incredibly pedestrian taste. Even if you spend $30, you’ll get Orin Swift. Find a good wine shop with people who can discuss your tastes, suggest new things, and respect your price point. My favorite shop is always eager to point out bargains in the $10-15 range.   2) It’s nice to be forced to try new things, have an excuse to spend a bit more than normal on a bottle or two, and to think about wine in a new way. I’ve had a ton of fun doing the New York Times’ wine school over the past year or so. This has been a big part of me getting into wine – it’s exposed me to higher-quality wine than I usually drink, led me to discover some new styles, and given me a framework for how I think about wine. I would highly recommend finding a friend or three and buying the three recommended (or similar) bottles each month. Tasting variations of the month’s style has taught me a lot – much more than simply drinking one bottle would have. Plus, Eric Asimov is such a great and unpretentious wine writer. It helps that my personal taste tends to mesh pretty well with his.  3) As for my own discovery of wine, it’s been a multi-year process, but two things really made me a “wine lover.” One has been doing the “wine school” (and subsequently becoming a regular consumer of other good wines). But my “road-to-Damascus” moment was a pair of meals I had in Portland last year: The seven-course tasting menu with the “reserve” wine pairings at Le Pigeon, and the six-course meal at DOC with the wine pairings (Le Pigeon was, hands-down, much better, and the best meal I’ve ever had). These exposed me to some old stuff (1988 Oregon pinot gris! 1997 Washington State merlot!), weird stuff (orange wine made by Italian nuns! Renegade producers of sparkling wine who eschew any DOC!), and eye-opening combinations (lobster and truffles with vintage champagne! Foie gras ice cream with Sauternes!). So, if you can spare the money, do a crazy meal like that sometime."

My sister took me out to Majestic, a UK proper wine shop at Christmas to get some stuff in and picked pretty much randomly.

And that's a pretty mainstream dealer, once I know my stuff I can go to an actual specialist."
wine,37hczc,unclefire,1 point,Wed May 27 18:46:32 2015 UTC,It kind of depends really .  If you know what you're looking for the supermarket might be ok.  e.g. Cline Ancient Vine Zin is pretty good can be found in some supermarkets (in AZ that is).  So are SOME other brands.    Some higher end markets could have decent wines too.
wine,37hczc,dcloafer,1 point,Wed May 27 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"Re: Cline, that's actually what I'm talking about. Spend $15 on a grocery store wine, and you're almost certainly not going to get something that's really rough or has obvious fatal flaws. Winemaking technology is such nowadays that even for $7, you're not likely to get complete and utter plonk. But you won't get subtlety, acidity, or character. You're paying almost exclusively for concentration and ""smoothness."" Hence the most expensive bottle at Safeway is typically ""The Prisoner."" Cline and similar wines have a nice mouthfeel if you like that style, and it's definitely very smooth - but that's about it."
wine,37hczc,ourmodelcitizen,3,Thu May 28 15:16:40 2015 UTC,"Taste, taste, taste. Find out where public tastings are, whether paid or not--they are almost always worth the money. The people holding them will usually be able to answer any questions you have or have the resources to do so. For the price of one bottle you can try multiple. You can't lose.  Secondly, take notes. They don't have to be detailed. But what strikes you about a wine? Do whatever works for you, whether that's just a little shorthand about a wine, take a photo and jot a few things down, get one of those apps to help you organize, buy one of those notebooks that is themed around wine tasting, or whatever! But truly, writing it down or taking a picture will help commit it to memory. It'll feel super dorky and geeky when you first do it but it helps so much.  Use a simple resource like winefolly.com to help get you started on the basics. Once you go, ""Oh, okay, so in Burgundy I'm going to find Pinot Noir and Chardonnay,"" go try some Burgundian Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Once you have 5-6 of each kind, then try other Chards and Pinots from around the world. Compare. Contrast. Splurge on a pricey one from each region at some point.  Above all, trust your wine merchant--or find one you feel you can trust on recommendation from a friend. As someone who spent a few years working at one, I can tell you, nothing pleases them more than someone just coming in and saying, ""I just want to learn about wine."" Because you're not coming in saying, ""Well, I need a white, under 20, but DON'T GIVE ME SAUVIGNON BLANC AND DON'T UPSELL ME."" Or whatever. You're putting your taste in their hands. A good wine merchant will never steer you wrong on purpose.   Once you feel you know everything, accept that you will probably be proven wrong at some point. And that's the fun of it. We're always learning. Welcome to the club!"

My eye opening experience was a trip to San Francisco and I tasted a good bit of wine in Napa and then at a Wine Shop there and we'll that was it for me.   It is almost an obsession for me.   As for what to do, taste as much as you can.   I try not to blind buy.  It is too random and expensive.   There is a wine shop in town that does tastings at least once a week and I go to all I can.   Also have gone to some classes, read books, watch videos, etc. I like to learn as much as I can though.   So just dive in.   If you can find tastings, that is more ideal as they are free at most shops and you can start to tell what you like.   I also try to look at reviews of what I like to see what the professional descriptors of what I taste are as I am poor in describing what I taste.   The helps because I can better anticipate what I will taste in a wine  when I go to read reviews.   One type of wine to recommend to you would be a Chateuneuf du Pape.  Similar to Rio but less oak (that us what I taste, and I know that dovetails with what I have heard some somms state)."
wine,37hczc,CondorKhan,2,Wed May 27 17:50:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah will have to look up tastings, i'm a regular at whisky tastings, so it can't be too hard.

Maybe with a bit of a particular fruit or spice in there sometimes, then I see the tasting notes on here and am astounded. But then I guess people are the same when starting out with scotch."
wine,37hczc,unclefire,2,Wed May 27 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"I was at a tasting a month ago on a cruise ship and we were tasting one wine.   I was at a table with a couple who were avid wine drinkers and I could tell pretty decent at tasting/smelling.   I was struggling with a Malbec because all I could smell was alcohol.   The ship's sommelier was waxing on about the fruit on the nose and this and that.   I am aggressively swirling and smelling and all I get is alcohol.  Then the lady across from me States that is all she smells as well so I felt better.   The next wine was funny too.   Carmenere from Chile.   Somm goes on about the awesome fruit in the wine and doesn't mention the dominant flavor of the nose and taste is of smoked bell pepper.   Your tasting is probably better than you think.   If you are into whiskey you probably will pick out packed flavors readily in a wine.   But there are plenty of blah wines out there.   I have a had a number of white wines that I can only say taste of green apple and plenty of red wines that are mediocre enough to just say they taste like red wine.  And reading others tasting notes helps as well.   You are tasting everything, you just don't describe it well yet."

Weird.  I've also tasted/smelled wines where I recognized the smell, but could name what it was.

Learning a structure for tasting will help you advance your tasting skills quickly.   Don't sweat the notes. I'm in the wine biz in the US and taste very often. I just use shorthand to note acid, residual sugar, tannin, color, aromas, flavor, oak, intensity,  etc. Writing wine spectator notes, in my opinion, is useless. Those notes usually don't convey a real idea of what the wine is like. They usually only give you an aspect or two of the wine.   We all process wine differently. Unless it is necessary for others to read and comprehend your notes don't worry about iT. The more cryptic the notes are, the more advanced someone will probably consider your palate (kidding, mostly)  Most important, as long as you are having fun, furthering your enjoyment and satisfying your quest for wine knowledge you are on the right track"

wine,37i7ka,theultrayik,1 point,Wed May 27 21:09:58 2015 UTC,That is good to know. But this applies in general to Old and New World wine for most regions?  A French wine is more likely to be good if it is from a small or medium size producer?
wine,37i7ka,theultrayik,3,Thu May 28 00:58:44 2015 UTC,"This applies to everywhere.  Basically, good wine comes from grapes that come from low-yield plants that are taken care of very carefully and planted on the best vineyard sites.  Large commercial wineries can't be as site-selective when producing huge amounts of wine, nor can they afford to keep plants at low-yield.  And, if they want the price to stay low, they can't afford to give grapes the same careful hand treatment as small producers.  Much of the work is automated and done in a massive, scientific laboratory environment."

But, I'd say in general you can usually find decent wines in the $12-20, really good wines in the $20-45 range, and fantastic wines in the $45+ range.  If you've gone over $100, you've probably goofed."

I've many diners that enjoy giant cabs from start to finish (or at least think they do) even when they start with scallops and a salad before steak and potatoes. There's nothing inherently wrong with that.  If I can convince them to do a well-paired white into pinot into meritage or the big cab or whatever, they tend to like it even better though. Sometimes it is good to have a progression not only in the food."

wine,37f81n,FantasticMrWooly,8,Thu May 28 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would be more concerned if you weren't changing wines. Serving a big, ballsy Cab-sav with delicate seafood like scallops would be a major faux pass, as the heavy flavors and tannins would completely overwhelm your otherwise well thought out fish course.   As a very general rule, red wine goes with red meat and heavy dishes, where as white wine goes with white meat/fish and light dishes (also most spicy dishes, but lets not over complicate). Its perfectly acceptable (I would even say encouraged) to match a different wine with each course, something like sparkling wine or an aperitif for your Hors d'oeuvres, White wines with fish/salad courses, red wines with steak or roast and a port or sticky wine with desert.  Often fine dining restaurants will do wine matched degustation menus, witch can sometimes include well over ten individual courses served over several hours, with each dish having its own accompanying wine pairing.  Hope this helps and enjoy your dinner party!"

wine,37f81n,ourmodelcitizen,4,Wed May 27 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Usually you see curries done with lighter meats anyway, like chicken and fish--which you'd probably do with whites in any case. Then, off-dry whites are often lower alcohol, and lower alcohol is the key to pairing with spicy foods. The often inherent sweetness in them balances the spicy in the curry.   I once did a very basic (but tasty) spicy chana masala. Paired it with a Alsatian Pinot Blanc. Was one of the most amazing pairings I've had."

wine,37f81n,rozenda,2,Thu May 28 06:45:19 2015 UTC,I've done dinners like this thru my job. When ever you are doing a multi course dinner you want to start off with the lighter courses first ie a salad/vegetable course is usually first then a soup course if you want one then a fish followed buy a heavier meats like pork beef and lamb. It is very similar to wine tasting you dont want to start off with merlot if you are going to be trying a sauvignon blanc as well you will lose the nuances of the sauvignon. For the wine if it is a 5 course dinner we set out five wine glasses and fill each one along side the course usually a few minutes before the food comes out to allow the guest to try the wine and let it breath. also if you are serving wine with dessert remember that when you are pairing wine with dessert that the wine must be sweeter than the desert or it will get lost. try trockenbeerenauslese if you want to go all out its a classic dessert wine

wine,37f81n,jimmydarmody,1 point,Wed May 27 13:20:51 2015 UTC,"For this sort of dinner, I would recommend you serve the fish prior to the steak.   Typically, you want to start with lighter wines and gradually move towards your heavier reds like cabs.  At a restaurant with a tasting menu that includes wine, they would always follow this rule as respect to the pallet of the customer.    Hors d'oevres with aperitif, Starters with white wine, Fish with white wine or something light like pinot noir, Red meat with Cabernet Sauvignon,  and Dessert with a port or sherry  Keep in mind however, that all of this is subjective. Nothing wrong with trying something new :)  EDIT: I cant make lists apparently :|"

wine,37f81n,unclefire,1 point,Wed May 27 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"As others have indicated you want lighter ""stuff"" first followed by more bold stuff (wine and food).  Even if you were doing all reds, the typical path is lighter reds to bolder reds.  You probably don't want to go with a cab followed by a lighter white.  Now on pairings-- I frankly don't stick with the traditional whites-fish/sea food,  reds- meat.    But that's me.  I'm partial to reds so even with fish/seafood a lighter red will be ok IMO.    In fact, last weekend while in Cali, we had fish twice with reds and it was fine.   Now- they weren't big bold reds (like cab though)."

Much healthier than drinking the entire bottle each night.thats not to say that on Friday or Saturday with the really good bottle you don't always spit.  My rationalization is that I am drinking wine for the taste.  If I just wanted a buzz, vodka would be the way to go. If I spit, I still get to taste the wine.  And perfecting your spitting form, as odd as it sounds, is fun. And finally, I always smile when I am at a tasting event and you see people spitting.

I feel like habits are formed very quickly and for the sake of health in later life, should wine be used less for de stressing and more for an enjoyment state of mind?"
wine,37ds3e,HingleMcringleberry1,1 point,Wed May 27 08:57:42 2015 UTC,"1-2 glasses in a night, 3 times a week isn't excessive at all and falls within all health guidelines.  It's more about dependence, if you're using wine as a tool among many to help you de-stress then I think that's fine, but if it becomes the only way you can de-stress or have a good time that's when it becomes a problem."

I think I got the only doctor who doesn't drink last time I went, they weren't impressed, but I've had worse vices in my life so as far as I'm concerned if I can afford it, then a bottle of red a day is fine after I've quit cigarettes and party drugs.

wine,37foc8,CondorKhan,1 point,Wed May 27 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"So much of the way that wine is treated in England revolves around how easily they could get it from France (be it by special agreement during wartime or specialized negociantes when the industry was growing).   Seems to me that if a nation's historical stance toward wine is how best to get it from other places, there's not much of an infrastructure present that really facilitates scaling the industry.  Sure, there are ex-pats who can come into a place and bring some of that foreign infrastructure with them, but all in all, I'm still skeptical about English sparkling wine (especially when you compare across varietals and price points)."
wine,37foc8,quixologist,2,Wed May 27 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"The reason England never really made a significant amount of their own wine is that it never really had the weather, technology or viticultural knowledge to cultivate vines for high quality wine. Now that's all starting to change.  Yes, english sparkling is pretty expensive in the overall context of wine. However, for what they're making, it's not very expensive for the style. They're making vintage wines from classic champagne varities in the champenoise style, usually with 2-4 years of aging on lees; all of which requires a significant amount of overhead. I think it's pretty impressive considering the best examples cost around £25-30, the same as an average NV champagne, and it's excellent stuff. The question is will it ever gain a reputation and become more than a novelty to the rest of the world."
wine,37foc8,absolute_banger,2,Wed May 27 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"One of the best sparkling wines I've ever had was from Nyetimber, last year we had a magnum of their 1996 BdB and it was absolutely gorgeous and at just over £80 I don't think anyone could accuse it of being overpriced when you consider the age, quality and the fact that it's 2 bottle's worth and the extra cost in terms of glass etc.  There are some World Class sparklers coming out of England, Nyetimber, Camel Valley, Gusbourne, Hambledon are all terrific in my opinion and when stacked up against readily available Champagnes in their price range (~£22-30) are rarely beaten."

wine,37czmi,ourmodelcitizen,3,Tue May 26 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"Hungarian oak barrels are largely made from the same species as French barrels, Quercus robur, with an occasional Quercus petraea thrown into the mix.    Hungarian barrels suffer from the same problems as American and French barrels in that there exists so much variation between trees, forests, and cooperage practices that no general rules of thumb can be applied to their sensory contributions to wine.  Different oak trees within a single parcel of land can have significantly different chemical compositions.  The different conditioning treatments, wood working techniques, and eventual toasting styles, times, and temperatures within each cooperage facility leads to further variation in barrel composition.    It is because of this variation that we can't say that French/Hungarian oak gives a wine A, B, and C qualities, while American oak gives D, E, and F qualities.  It sounds nice for the winery tours, but scientifically it doesn't hold up."

Even in places like Rioja where American oak is prevalent, the oak isn't as pronounced.   Is this still just marketing? Or is it just how grapes grown in a certain terroir interacts with the oak?

wine,37cey9,undergroundaleroad,3,Tue May 26 16:32:17 2015 UTC,Just drink it. It doesn't need to age.  What didn't you like about the Village wines?
wine,37cey9,Muppet_Mower,1 point,Tue May 26 16:48:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't take notes, so this is more of a gestalt memory of not being too into it.  I didn't spit it out or anything, it just wasn't to my taste.  Perhaps it seemed sweeter than I cared for?  That was certainly an issue I took with the nouveaus, but I'm aware that non-nouveau Beaujolais isn't really a fair comparison."
wine,37cey9,Ausonius89,2,Tue May 26 17:42:40 2015 UTC,You might be averse to the carbonic expression of Gamay - there's a certain enzyme that's created by carbonic maceration that smells kind of bubble-gummy or like ripe bananas.  Many Cru Beaujolais on the other hand are semi-carbonic or simply traditionally vinified.
wine,37cey9,fromscratch404,3,Tue May 26 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know if enzymes smell like much, but if you're thinking about ripe bananas we are talking about isoamyl acetate, an ester. And I dont think it comes primarily from the carbonic maceration, but rather from what yeast culture you are using. Bubble-gum aroma is also from an ester, although I can't recall it's name.  Have heard lots of rumours about how Beaujolais producers pick certain yeast strains for their ability to produce these fruity almost candy like esters. Not sure how true this is, but I don't think I've ever tried a beaujolais nouveau without being hit by banana up front."
wine,37cey9,Laplandia,2,Wed May 27 07:01:21 2015 UTC,"Isoamyl acetate is formed by yeasts during fermentation. The concentration formed is yeast-dependent. Carbonic maceration, must aeration, and must clarity also play a key influence on the amounts formed.   So it's both actually."

wine,37cey9,Socrates5150,1 point,Wed May 27 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"It doesn't need to but it's worth pointing that it definitely can and probably will improve. It's worth trying these wines at their youngest at some point though, as it's a pretty important reference point for this particular style."
wine,37cey9,megapurple,3,Tue May 26 22:51:22 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. Foillard is a great producer and Morgon wines have the capacity to age. But I would just drink it. Especially if you haven't had any luck with Beaujolais in the past. If you love it, grab another bottle and and lay it down for a few years, but there's no reason to age it before you've had it."
wine,37cey9,benchley,3,Tue May 26 17:43:53 2015 UTC,i find most Morgon's and Moulin-a-Vent's show better with 3 to 4 yrs of age since they tend to be in a more structured style than lighter cru BoJo's (like Fleurie or Julienas) which are more fruit-centric pop & pour bottles. Some of the best examples of Morgon/Moulin can be easily confused with medium-weight Pinots.

I was in your position a few years ago, sent out 300 CVs to wineries and received one offer. Directly emailing wineries seems more effective, I've gotten nearly all my vintages this way.  Alternatively, you could work vintage in New Zealand quite easily. They start hiring in August, shouldn't be too hard to get a visa if you're under thirty, and vintage is easy to find in Marlborough. Flights are about $1,500 RT, but they pay $13/hour US, and you'll work 70-100 hours per weeks for at least 2-3 weeks.  That said, go tasting, with weekends off surely some wineries are open."

Also the wine will probably not be as good as it could be if you're ageing it like this, but provided you don't leave it too long shouldn't be too bad.  Hope this helps."

wine,37br4u,beuk,11,Tue May 26 13:35:40 2015 UTC,"This bottle appears to from the Lustau Almacenistas series. Almacenistas are smaller producers who usually sell their wine to larger houses to be bottled and shipped. In the 1980's Lustau started to highlight some of the better examples keeping individual wines separate from larger soleras and featuring the Almacenista's name prominently on the label. The fraction refers to the number of casks in the solera (or butts). In this case it is an extremely small solera of 2 casks, pretty unusual. Viuda de Antonio Borrego is the almacenista. They went on to bottle their own wine as El Maestro Sierra due largely in part to the attention garnered from these Lustau releases. It appears this particular bottling was for a specific wine club. Pretty cool bit of history you have there.  From what I understand oloroso can benefit from some bottle aging. It certainly won't damage the wine, as others here have pointed out.   Note: I pretty much plagiarized most of this information from a book called Sherry Manzanilla and Montilla: A Guide to the Traditional wines of Andalucia by Peter Liem and Jesus Barquin.

If a bottle gets too hot for an extended period of time, it can ""cook"" the wine, turning it into a stewy, jammy mess.

It might not be a long lived wine though. IDK, I'm just thinking about weird stuff."
wine,37chvs,Twerp129,1 point,Tue May 26 21:18:12 2015 UTC,There's a reason many people say quality wines need to age: their tannins are too harsh and haven't integrated with the rest of the wine.   How does that integration happen? Through exposure to oxygen. This is why most quality wines are still done under corks -- cork allows some oxygen exchange between the bottle and its environment. (This is why some bottled under screw-cap end up with reduction flavors.)  Barrels do the same thing. The tannins are broken down and integrated by (controlled!) exposure to oxygen. That's part of why many reds see extended barrel aging while many whites -- even those which do see some oak -- aren't kept in barrel for nearly as long.

wine,378o91,Sazerac1850,3,Mon May 25 20:23:08 2015 UTC,Were they upright or on their sides? Chances are they're no good. The liquors/whiskey should be fine. Wines are probably oxidized all to hell. Port should be drinkable.

wine,378o91,kaseycarpenter,1 point,Mon May 25 20:33:37 2015 UTC,"Oh no! Are they supposed to be on their side or something?  I found one with the cork eaten away by the alcohol, I figured they'd be better upright  where the alcohol couldn't get to the cork."
wine,378o91,Muppet_Mower,8,Mon May 25 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, corks that aren't moistened by liquid will dry out and crack, which lets air into the bottle."
wine,378o91,smutsmutsmut,2,Mon May 25 20:43:37 2015 UTC,Good to know! We actually threw out one bottle because the liquid was seeping through the cork; that one was probably around 60+ years old.
wine,378o91,BourbonScotchWhiskey,4,Tue May 26 02:47:36 2015 UTC,"It was probably ""eaten away"" by dessication, i.e. drying out and falling into the bottle, alcohol doesn't really eat away at corks - the idea is that you want some contact with the cork to retain shape and elasticity, and therefore the seal, but not too much contact (say storing your wine bottles upside down) where gravity might exert undue force on the cork and allow wine to percolate through the cork.    All that having been said, none of the wines you listed will benefit from any further aging, even the '70 port - though as other have noted, it is the one most likely to have survived and will likely continue to survive, declining at a slower rate than the others assuming they haven't hit rock bottom which the in all likelihood have).  Open them up, worst case scenario is that you have some vinegar, best case is you might get some caramel/nutty/vegetal aspects to a tired but still fighting wine.  Sparkling Burgs, true sparkling burgs, are fairly uncommon, and would be worth a try just for academics."

I think we're going to try and open a few up this weekend, I will make sure to write an update if we do.  I was afraid of opening them before because I assumed they would have ""rotted"" and stank.  It's good to know that the worst case scenario is vinegar tasting wine.  From now on we will invest in a proper wine rack for the basement, and no more hoarding wines from 60+ years ago."
wine,378o91,Yurcoxafailin,2,Tue May 26 02:46:29 2015 UTC,Dont open them with a corkscrew. Buy an ah-so which is made to open older bottles. A corkscrew will destroy those older corks.

wine,378o91,kaseycarpenter,3,Tue May 26 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"The Dewars is a cheap blend and white label is their cheapest blend so hardly any worth there. Maybe $20 to a collector and youd have a hard time finding someone who would take you up on it. Nothing special. Personally Id dump it out and try it for shits and giggles.  Now..that Old Forester is a different story. Thats a killer find. It was stored upright as it should be. Its corked so if you open it be careful, the cork may have dried out and trying to open it will make it all fall in the whiskey. And the greater concern for opening it is also with the sudden bourbon craze people have been trying to hunt down older bottles. People want to drink what their grandparents drank. Dustys are what they are called and if you head on over to /r/bourbon youll see people touting the older bottles of stuff they find. Your bottle is tax stamped so that tells me at the very earliest its early 80s but based on the age of everything else with it I would say 70s or late 60s which that makes the bottle worth in the area of $200-250 at the bare minimum I believe. I saw a couple postings for $400 but they may be special bottlings from the same time period Im not sure.   If you wanted to sell that bottle there would be plenty of people who would want it. Go post in /r/bourbon to see if anybody else can give you more info or a more accurate pricing. Someone will prob want to buy it from you."

Or we could just drink it anyway and I can tell him that he was completely right about not just throwing everything away in the basement; he'd probably like that just as much :)  Thank you so much for the information, it's really appreciated and I did not expect this at all!

wine,377iak,sector61,6,Mon May 25 15:01:29 2015 UTC,"There's sparkling Rosé and then there's sparkling red, such as ones based off Shiraz. Sparking Shiraz is quite popular in Australia, and bloody delicious too. Some have a touch of sweetness to accompany the fruit, but only a hint. Others are quite dry, but almost all have at the least a dry finish. Turkey Flat, Charles Melton, Joseph, Rockford and as a cheap and cheerful option Syn make really nice sparkling Shiraz/Shiraz blends. These have the typical flavour profiles of a Shiraz/Syrah, but are best served slightly chilled to help with the carbonation.  Rosé has more of a white wine-ish kind of flavour profile. Strawberry's, bright red fruits, touch of sweetness, hopefully some more complex flavours with an off-dry to dry finish."
wine,377iak,cnralex,3,Mon May 25 14:55:11 2015 UTC,How is sparkling Shiraz generally treated? Is it usually sipped by itself as an aperitif? What do people eat with it?

""Mousseux"" means ""sparkling,"" but unless the label says ""grand mousseux"" it is a bit less sparkling than Champagne. My memory is that the wine was a lot lighter in weight and more refreshing than sparkling shiraz. I do recall tasting the Seppelt Sparkling Shiraz and being floored by it--except for the Syrah aromas and flavors, I'd have guessed it was a red Champagne.

But for that amount of money, you could get a spectacular still or sparkling wine. The Rockford black is not spectacular. The d'Arenburg is pretty cheap and cheerful ($30). The ebst value is probably the Lehmann ($50), but it is again overpriced for what it is.  TL;DR: Interesting but Overpriced."

wine,377ym3,bitcoinfan87,6,Mon May 25 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"Well in the CMS blind tasting gird that they use in the Somm film, you are almost always going to lock down a varietal and region first. Then most students can at least ball park an age based on development of the wine. (1-3 yrs old, 3-5 yrs old, 5-10, and 10+). And once you feel confident about the region of origin, and age range, at that point, students at the Masters level should be able to identify 1 or 2 vintages in that region that showed the characteristics of the wine they are tasting within those general age ranges and rule out 1 or 2 that don't show the wine's characteristics. And there are many factors in wine that can clue you in to the climate for its vintage, like acid, tannin, sweetness, extraction, green notes etc. At that point you have pretty good odds of getting it right.  But all that doesn't do much good unless you are tasting a lot, a lot, a lot and comparing climate for that year with style."

wine,377ym3,Nightninja76,1 point,Tue May 26 05:23:28 2015 UTC,"Both. Even if you've never had a particular wine in a given vintage you still might be able to hone in on the year by what (you think) you know about the wine, its composition, and age. For example, I served an '81 Torres Gran Coronas Reserva double blind to a couple friends a few months ago. They immediately identified it as Cabernet or Cab-based but didn't think it was from Bordeaux or Cali. They started looking at other origins; Italy? South America? Spain - one mentioned it reminded him of the Torres style so they started down that path. They knew it was pretty old from the color and development and one asked the the other if he thought 80s or 90s and they agreed it was probably 80s so they guessed '81 just based on longevity and aging potential of the vintage."

wine,37358k,coffee-cake,4,Sun May 24 12:51:36 2015 UTC,"I can tell you the TTB doesn't care what's on the pretty label. They just want brand name, appellation, Alc. % by Vol. , wine type (red/white), importer name and state, and the surgeon general warning. Though it's very specific for size of font and such. The pretty front label is actually normally considered the back label and the boring text filled info with importer information is the Front or Brand label. Not that this has anything to do with the argument in this article, I just always think it's funny how much goes into the design of these labels when 90% of the time a white label with black text is good enough and of course doesn't make anything inside the bottle taste any better. Though when I was working retail I did go by the ""no critter"" wine label rule of thumb. This normally ruled out any cheap, high volume, low quality wines of mass production but then again look at wines like Duckhorn who makes a killer Decoy with a ""critter"" on the label. It just goes to show that you can't judge a book by its cover or a wine by the label."

As /u/filledevin mentioned, legal requirements are a huge part of what goes on wine labels. In the US and EU there are half a dozen or more things required to be on there, and because these markets are so large any vineyard of considerable size is going to adhere to these requirements. They may have separate labels for foreign markets, but if you're trying to establish a global brand they're usually pretty uniform.  The article also doesn't mention regional traditions. Compare Bordeaux wines to Burgundy to Alsace and you'll find that there is definitely a certain style.   I mentioned the influence of label in my post about my visit to Château Angélus. Long story short: they printed a special label when they were moved up to the highest class, and that particular bottle sells for 200 euros more than a normal bottle.  Okay I'm done rambling."

wine,3730mn,skeeter_valentine,2,Mon May 25 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"I'll do my best to synthesize what has already been said about AdB: It's price tag comes from its perceived exclusivity, not its quality.  It's hard to accurately quantify price to taste, especially when you get into the ""exorbitant"" stratosphere of wine. Can you truly taste the difference between a $200 bottle of wine and a $2000 bottle of wine? In my opinion, the answer is most usually no. I was lucky enough to get a taste of a 1976 Dom Perignon Rosé without knowing its actual price; it was delicious, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't $1,500 delicious.  Which gets us to the AdB. The people who are drinking Ace of Spades aren't drinking it because they are looking for exceptionally quality champagne, in the same way that people aren't looking to drink DRC for its quality (although I'm sure it's fucking delicious). They're drinking it for something else, be it the the history, the prestige, the exclusivity, or the fact they have never drunk anything that expensive before in their life.  For me, I've had one bottle of Ace of Spades and can confidently say that there are better bottles of Champagne out there for $40. If you go to a reputable wine store and ask for an informed opinion, I'm sure everyone would say the same thing. The same goes for newer vintages of Dom Perignon and Cristal as well: where the large champagne houses take grapes from many different sites, the small producers usually source from one vineyard or plot, providing much more definition, strength, and flavor. And since they aren't name-brand or have shown up in a music video, they're going to sell their wine for cheaper.  With that said, it's exhilarating to drink something that exclusive or historic. At times, I want to drink something like that. But if I'm looking to geek out on a champagne that is complex, rich, and unique, I can definitely find something for way cheaper.  In the end, much like many answers to questions like these, it boils down to what you want out of your wine drinking experience.  Hope you get to form your opinion on it soon enough! Cheers!"

Most drinkers have an idea of what a Chardonnay tastes like. When they are presented with a $50 Chardonnay that is Burgundian in style their palates are startled and probably will rejects mineral qualities where they expect oak, (for example.) So perhaps the median bottle will be the ""better"" bottle, it is actually just the more palatable bottle. But I guess this video, and cheap wine in general, caters to an inexperienced palate.   That said, however, anything above a $50 bottle of Pinot is pretty much a gimmick. I have yet to try one above that price point that truly surpassed a craft Pinot that I could find for around 50.

This is Moscatel (Muscat or Moscato) of Alexandria  from old vines in the mountains of Axarquía, near Malaga. Fermented in stainless steel, with fermentation arrested by means of cold temperature at 10% abv. #1 is the most inexpensive, and it goes all the way to the expensive and rare #4. It's a collaboration between importer Jorge Ordoñez and Alois Kracher of Austria.  But you wouldn’t know this is inexpensive. Pours pale greenish yellow.  On the nose, intense and spicy Muscat aromas of flowers, must and a bit of lychee. On the palate, absolutely amazing syrupy concentration, with a combination of sweetness and a slight bitterness that is really not unlike biting into a tangerine or even a grapefruit. Some apricot and spices show up as well. The finish is long, with some minerality and some medicinal bitterness. Maybe blind I could completely mistake this for a really good late harvest Gewurztraminer from Alsace. This is significantly better than the 2011, which was excellent to begin with.  And absolutely decadent with the passionfruit sorbet.   This is a wine of ridiculous concentration and complexity that is not really that much more expensive than some of the big selling sugary supermarket moscatos. At 16 bucks, I feel like I stole it.

wine,371uz8,huxley2112,7,Sun May 24 19:01:39 2015 UTC,"If you came in to my shop with a bottle that you bought somewhere else (or didn't buy from here) and wanted me to swap it over for you because it was corked I would respectfully show you the door, especially if I had never seen you before and you weren't planning on buying anything.  If you are a good customer of mine and explained the situation and had demonstrated loyalty as a patron of mine, I would certainly give it my best shot for you.  In other words, don't show up to any old shop and try to get a bottle replaced if you didn't buy it from there, it's kind of rude unless you have a relationship with the merchant already."
wine,371uz8,sgarbusisadick,1 point,Mon May 25 03:54:02 2015 UTC,"I would respectfully show you the door, especially if I had never seen you before and you weren't planning on buying anything.   Wow, your customers are so lucky that you allow them to buy wine from you! /s  Like I said, it's no skin off the retailers teeth because the distributor should credit them the bottle.  It's just a bit of paperwork and not a big deal at all.  I thought I also made it clear that it isn't an expected service, rather a favor being done, hence:   I'd make a purchase from the retailer if they do this to show appreciation.   I don't get why you would pass on the chance to offer good customer service at no extra cost to your store.  It's something I've seen done before, and no issue was made of it so I'm not sure why you would 'show someone the door' for asking."
wine,371uz8,huxley2112,2,Mon May 25 05:37:43 2015 UTC,"Well actually, in the real world it's a bit more complicated then that.   Firstly, not all suppliers do credit bottles back.  Also, many will want to see and inspect the wine to make sure it is faulty, and there have been countless occasions when someone has returned a wine believing it to be faulty when it is actually completely fine. So in that scenario, someone has walked into my store, with a perfectly fine bottle and I have refunded it at my own cost no questions asked.  Now add the fact that they didnt purchase the wine from me and I've lost a bottle for no reason.   Now add vintage wine to the mix and it becomes even messier. What if someone buys a bottle of wine 2 years ago and claims it's corked and wants a refund from me?  Maybe 'show them the door' is a bit strong but I would explain to them my situation and hope that they would understand.  And no offence, but the type of person that expects a retailer to replace a bottle of wine bought from another store without question is not likely to buy something else for the hassle."
wine,371uz8,winemule,1 point,Mon May 25 12:46:59 2015 UTC,"Well actually, in the real world it's a bit more complicated then that.   well, actually I work in the industry and it isn't more complicated than that.   Firstly, not all suppliers do credit bottles back.   The supplier may not, but I'm sure the distributor would replace it.  Any distributor that is worth a damn will at least.   What if someone buys a bottle of wine 2 years ago and claims it's corked and wants a refund from me?   You shouldn't be refunding anything, and that's not at all what I am suggesting.  Please understand that I am saying they should replace the bottle with the same product.  Different vintage?  Too bad, they will just have to get the newer vintage.  If you don't carry it, then there is no way to replace it, so it's a moot point.   And no offence, but the type of person that expects a retailer to replace a bottle of wine bought from another store without question is not likely to buy something else for the hassle.   Actually, the kind of person willing to go out of their way to give a brand another shot because the first one was corked is exactly who you want as a customer.  It's a simple service issue.  If any of my retailers asked me to replace a bottle that was brought to them in the above scenario, I would do it without question because I know the supplier/winery would want me to.  Their customers are my customers.  If those aren't the kind of distributor relationships you have, I'd suggest asking for new reps :)"
wine,371uz8,huxley2112,1 point,Tue May 26 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"One other point: There's no credit, no anything, if the bottle came from a distributor the store doesn't do business with. I've taken back many a bottle that was actually fine (we'd drink it after closing, or someone might volunteer to take it home), but taking back something I didn't sell and have no connection to? There are limits to goodwill."

wine,36yu4s,Send_Lawyers,4,Sat May 23 07:20:32 2015 UTC,"I did my level 3 a few weeks ago and the blind exam wasn't too hard but I enjoyed practicing for it. Have a friend go out and buy a few of the tier one wines from differing price ranges and blind taste them.  Compare your blind notes with the notes you write in class. Most of the marks are placed on structure and aromas at this level, so don't worry if you don't guess the wine.  Also, study the characteristics of the tier 1 wines. In the exam (at least in the london school) they gave a list of three possible wines each blind wine could be. Don't pidgeonhole yourself to one wine, but if you've studied the characteristics of each wine, and you have an idea of what it might be, it can help."
wine,36yu4s,absolute_banger,3,Sat May 23 11:15:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I took the test last month and its key to know the profiles of what the grapes should taste like. We practiced writing ""blind"" tasting notes. We got 3 choices and 2 of them were close with 1 outlier.  All that being said i think guessing the wine is only 4 points of the 50-60 so make sure you are focusing more on the structure and not forgetting anything. You get ""gimme"" points just by remembering to write the wine is clear, clean, and most likely dry.   You get more time than you need so work through it at your own pace!   As far as the test goes i found the multiple choice to be the most difficult where i had thought it would be the easiest.  Good luck!"

I've known people with a beaujolais in front of them produce a barolo tasting note due to this sort of thing."
wine,36yu4s,grapejuicedrinker,2,Sat May 23 11:12:04 2015 UTC,"Agree with comment about the freebie points: the wine is clear, the nose is clean, the wine is dry and has legs/tears. Just have your general descriptors ready to go (citrus fruit, tropical fruit, red fruit, black fruit, etc) and correct acid/alcohol/body terms and you'll do fine. It seems intimidating but looking back I should have been more focused on studying for the theory portion. Best of luck!"
wine,36yu4s,splashtonkutcher,2,Sat May 23 16:49:19 2015 UTC,"Level 3 tasting is probably easier than the theory. It depends on how much you study. (I did level 3 all in a single week so didn't have a lot of time to get into the theory, so I found the tasting much easier.)  As someone else suggested, do not look at the 3 options you are given, cover them up, evaluate the wine and come to your own conclusion. Then look at the options."
wine,36yu4s,_toreador_,2,Sat May 23 19:33:24 2015 UTC,"Make sure you know how to write a standard tasting note, as long as you hit all those points you are pretty much guaranteed to pass that part.  Getting the wine right is only like 2/25 pts, and you only need 55% to pass."
wine,36yu4s,madkent,2,Sat May 23 20:41:15 2015 UTC,"Been several years since my wset advanced exam, but I did do pretty well on the tasting portion.   Pay attention to alcohol content and acidity, and also think in terms of general flavor profiles (red fruit, black fruit, etc). These will be your best clues to placing the wine in a region. New world, old world, etc. From there you should be able to figure out which option is correct out of your choices.   What I remember most is that it's really easy to overthink it. Just stick to the basics and trust yourself and you'll be fine."

I love wine. I love learning about it, drinking it, tasting it and so on and so on. I am a geek first (my degree is a BSci but not a bit of that had anything to do with viticulture) and a wine guy second but never, ever, ever is that apparent to my guests.  I love my team and I love my guests. Still, my whales get fed a steady diet of Parker-scored wines and I'll gush about them appropriately. My job with those guys (and many of them really are pretty great) is to make them look good. I know, generally, their personal palates but still, it isn't about what they are drinking, it is about where, how and with whom.  And, that's completely fine!!  I never shed a tear when another bottle of the Screaming Ego goes out nor even the Silver Joke. You like it and want to pay for it? I love you!  I only get sad when a pristine DRC or a 50+ Bordeaux gets lost in the show-off. Spend away my friends but please, drink the juice you like rather than making me fight over how fucking fantastic that wine is versus your perception. You picked it on the price and nothing else.  At this point I kinda want a deal with the good counterfeiters. Just fill everything with Meomi or Caymus and I can sell it as whatever I like!  /rant"

I frequently hear, ""Oh I don't care for Bordeaux… Except Cos d'Estournel, of course…"" or ""How can people drink CA Pinot?"" and then they order a Calera.

wine,36qw9q,jaded76,12,Thu May 21 12:16:13 2015 UTC,"Goose Island is now ""craft"" beer? Um. No.   I also disagree that having a full beverage program is any threat or challenge to having a good wine list. ""Good"" in this case meaning it has a variety of styles to suit the theme of wherever the wine is being served. Beer, spirits and cocktails are all complimentary to the experience in their own way. They don't replace wine's role, unless we want to lump them all as alcoholic beverages. (Which is crap.)  While I can see that the idea that a deep wine list, with ""boring"" tasting notes may have less appeal, much of that is due to the limitation of paper and the consumer. If a guest doesn't know wine, few wine lists in the world are going to help them make a good choice, and certainly won't help them get past the stale old staples they may have heard of. If details are provided as to taste, an already long list just gets longer and it's a sea of words. Few customers want to spend the time reading these descriptions, no matter what insight they may provide.  It's the sommelier's role to provide insight, suggestion and point-education to help the guest arrive at something they will enjoy and remember. With a few questions, they should be able to guide the guest to something that fits the guest's flavor profile, budget and experience.  edit: pronoun fail."
wine,36qw9q,wineshark,1 point,Thu May 21 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"Hear hear.  You can have a 2 page list or a 80 page encyclopedia but if the sommelier can't sell the wine, it's a crappy program."
wine,36qw9q,Ausonius89,2,Thu May 21 14:57:44 2015 UTC,"I, for one, could not agree more. In most cases, the sommelier's role is to curate a list that best reflects or complements the restaurant's personality.   Too many buyers are still content to list the ""recognizable"" names and ""reliable"" categories and call it a day. I'm not saying don't have Napa cabernet on your list, but putting Caymus or Silver Oak on your list does not make your list exciting or even special. It's quite the opposite, in my opinion."
wine,36qw9q,Muppet_Mower,3,Thu May 21 12:20:07 2015 UTC,"Though I agree with you, the article seems to be implying something else entirely. It is saying that a beverage program should be more than just wine. It needs to have quality cocktails, beers, and other products.  Lists full of boring old recognizable wines do suck though. Unfortunately they are everywhere."
wine,36qw9q,zandytreats,1 point,Thu May 21 13:04:17 2015 UTC,"I read this as ""restaurants need to be more innovative with their beverage lists.""  Silver Oak and Caymus are staples on the most steak house wine lists. The average Jo recognizes them and will buy them. If owned a steakhouse you better believe I'd put those on the list.  We are in the business of making money! Like it or not people buy Silver Oak. I think the point of the article was ""live a little."" Hire a a good beverage buyer and put some unique stuff on it.

The point of the article is to say that a restaurant should have NOT ONLY good wine, but good drinks. This does not mean less good wine, it means more good non-wine drinks.  The website and the lecture it was talking about were delivered in London. As a resident in the trade here, I can confirm, everywhere is opening up to craft beer, cider, more younger whisky and other spirits drinkers, and even sake. And as the millennials are starting to dominate culture (and restaurant covers), people in London are seeking 'interesting' wine."

Similarly, we have restaurants that offer ticketed dinners, where a brewery sends one of their brewers or a cicerone to provide some education and limited-release beer for each course.

I took the dare to have a sip first, but we all did by the end.  Taste – Rough Polish vodka, leather, LEATHER, nail varnish/artificial pear flavour (closer to nail varnish), surprisingly not as bad as the nose. The smell wasn’t quite as terrible after taking the first sip.  We had a couple more sips and tried to convince each other that it was still drinkable for about 5 minutes before tipping it down the sink."

One of my tasting groups just did a theme of ""taking a gamble"" and we had some mixed results too - but nothing near this bad."

wine,36qerc,clarinettoclaret,2,Fri May 22 01:21:54 2015 UTC,that's a shame.  I had a 1980 Millers and an '81 St Huberts last year. both cabernet though so better structure i spose.  Both bought from auction but a hell of a lot cheaper than $40.  which auction did you buy from? how has it been stored since?  It's a shame as these old yarra wines can provide some lovely drinking if stored reasonably well.  better luck next time
wine,36qerc,smallerthanhiphop,2,Fri May 22 10:02:41 2015 UTC,"shame.  I also took a gamble during the week with an 1985 pol roger vintage (my parents wine, I wouldn't hold out hope on a vintage wine that old but apparently 85 was an epic vintage).  It was just awful.  There is also an 85 bollinger grand année that I found yesterday.  I am more hopeful with that."

People who weren't into their wine also commented that it was reminiscent of poo."

wine,36oezz,franzinator,2,Wed May 20 21:31:35 2015 UTC,"I've been using a Pungo for 10months and I love it. It's the best wine investment I ever made. Though similar to Coravin, it does play a slightly different role. I use it only on one bottle at a time as a means to extend that bottle out. Often I will only have a glass of wine every few days and this will allow the bottle to last without issues. The argon is cheaper and it pours great. You can theoretically use it one bottle then plug the hole and move on, but I have never tried that. If you want something to access multiple different bottles over extended periods get the Coravin. If you are looking for a wine preservation system (one bottle at a time) get the Pungo."

wine,36oezz,vinomenal,2,Thu May 21 17:06:32 2015 UTC,It's great. A bottle repeatedly drawn from for 6 months showed no change at all.

Here's the problem: to truly pronounce it properly you have to say it like a French person. It's a French word, after all.   Can you do a French R? It's basically the sound you make when you start hocking a loogie. Almost like you're clearing your throat, but a little farther forward in your mouth. Like this.  Make sure the O sound is a real O. Like ""Oh my god."" Like the word ""so.""  The S is pronounced like a Z.  The exact way you pronounce the ""é"" will depend on the particular accent you are imitating. Parisians apparently pronounce it like the E in ""jet"" or ""net"", while folks elsewhere pronounce it like the end of ""pay"" or ""gay."" There are certainly other ways native French speakers pronounce it as well.  They say the whole word a whole bunch in this video.  Don't want to sound like a twat? Just pronounce it the way you already were. Some folks do talk about rose wines or even pink wines though, so don't judge them too harshly for that. But if he corrected you he's a twat."

wine,36n6sw,rawdealbuffy,2,Wed May 20 17:56:20 2015 UTC,"I have thoughts although asking the Somm is never a bad idea!  34679 - Krupp Brothers “Synchrony-Stagecoach Vineyard” - 2009 - $195  Might be the single best bottle of wine I've had with a steak.  36952 - Quintessa - 2011 - $300  While I prefer the 2010 for it's tasty blackberry and crushed wet rocks quality. I think the 2011 is widely considered superior. Had both at the winery last year. This is a near perfect Napa wine for me and with a big juicy steak... Hopefully you're with your SO because their will be some hair pulling going on at the table.  For Bordeaux, I'd go St. Julien as they're typically very tannic reds.  Although they'd be off years you could go with the:  52788 - Leoville-Barton - 1995 - $300  52008 - Leoville-Las-Cases - 1999 - $300  or the on year:  52470 - Château Léoville Poyferré - 2000 - $350  Hope that get's the juices flowing at least."

As an example, the last time I was in there I was commenting to one of the Somm's about how many wines I get as a winery member that I'm surprised made it out into the public, much less on their wine list.  I asked for a recommendation based off of those small batch/exclusive wines in a similar price range and I was treated to a a wine that now I buy direct from the winery as a result of that experience.  Additionally, I asked for recommendations of places to visit while in the Champagne region of France, as I'll be visiting there this summer.

wine,36jsou,ourmodelcitizen,6,Tue May 19 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"Short background: at the wine store I worked at, we were only able to get a hold of 2 cases total, and I grabbed one last summer. I held off trying it until now. I bought it to a regular tasting group my friends and I formed, and we drink each Monday night.  Nose: Initially, it was really funky on the nose, barny. But this gave way to white flowers, oranges, fennel, fresh herbs like rosemary, sausages (or something undeniably meaty). There was a berry note of some kind there too but honestly, it was mostly savoury notes.  On the mouth: I have hardly tasted a wine with a more sensational mouthfeel. The acidity bounced off the mid palate but meanwhile there's just this silky-ness that is making it just slide around no problem. The finish just keeps going. It does feel a little hot on the alcohol but somehow it's not a problem because it's all so balanced. It reminded me very much of the feel of a beautiful red Burg, but without the same taste profile.  It went very well with some cured sausage. I think it was the favourite of the night by far, though there was one girl who said she didn't enjoy the savoury-ness of it.  I have reserved a couple of bottles of the next vintage. I'm going to try and save one to age it just to see. This is apparently one of the only roses known to age well.  Note on the alcohol: The bottle actually states 11-14% alcohol. I have never seen that before! Anyone else?"
wine,36jsou,omfgregg,1 point,Tue May 19 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to weigh in on the alcohol %. A lot of Kermit Lynch imports come in this way from all over France: White Bordeaux and Loire Valley are sticking out right now but I'm sure other regions do too. I'm not sure why but I've noticed it myself. I'm guessing it's a labeling issue, each new label must get approved by some sort of governing body so I imagine it's easier to not worry about the abv every year...?"
wine,36jsou,Socrates5150,1 point,Wed May 20 01:41:22 2015 UTC,"It's done this way because wine is taxed differently if it's under 14% or over. Not sure why they don't put the actual % on the bottle, but from tax purposes they only need to state if it's under or over 14%."
wine,36jsou,idog73,1 point,Wed May 20 02:02:41 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I know that here we can't make beer over 10% or else it gets taxed differently, too."
wine,36jsou,iwillnoteatgreeneggs,1 point,Wed May 20 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"It's interesting: at least in Canada, when wines (made here) are released, it can be within 1% of the actual ABV. So if you label your wine as 11.5%, it could actually be as high as 12.5% or as low as 10.5%.  It's really odd. My collection of go-to's is almost entirely Kermit Lynch (I really do need to branch out) and this is the first time I've seen the huge variance in ABV.  Or perhaps it's like you say, and rather than make new labels every year this is what they do. I've noticed French producers to be notorious for not caring as much about the labels--even though Tempier actually has quite a beautiful one--and maybe this is just one less thing to worry about."
wine,36jsou,iwillnoteatgreeneggs,1 point,Wed May 20 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"When a winery or importer has to submit a label to the TTB it's well before the actual alcohol is known usually.

wine,36jsou,jmhemming,2,Wed May 20 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"Not New World, but Juan Gil does a fantastic rendition of his Mouvedre --but of course, since it's from Jumilla, Spain, he calls his Monastrell. I think it would make a good substitute for a New World loving individual.  He has several pricing levels--mostly to do with how much oak aging the wine gets and what parcels it's from--but he has a great intro level one called Honoro Vera at $17.50 tax in (in Canada). I'm sure it's cheaper in the States if that's where you are.  Way, way different than Bandol of course. No comparison. Juan Gil will be less restrained, less elegant perhaps, and much bolder and fruitier. But it's always fascinating and even very important to see different takes on grapes in different climates and terroir."

wine,36lg55,Wicclair,12,Wed May 20 06:48:04 2015 UTC,"I'm finding that the more my palate develops, the less I like oak, especially in whites.  It just covers up the taste of the fruit, dulls all the great acid/tannin, and makes everything taste the same.  It's kind of like the equivalent of dark-roasting with coffee.    Don't get me wrong, it is important in the right application, but it has to be used judiciously.  And, yes, it can be used to cover flaws in low-quality wine."
wine,36lg55,theultrayik,7,Wed May 20 08:15:58 2015 UTC,"As everybody else said, when used judiciously it adds complexity and interest.  But it's fairly obvious when it's used to mask shitty wine and it becomes easier to spot the more experienced I become.  Sometimes, when you're tasting wines in a flight situation, a super-oaky wine will smother more balanced wines and will come out as ""the winner"". I've been fooled like that a couple of times... I think a wine in a flight is the best one, take the bottle home only to find out that it doesn't really taste that good in a real life drinking situation."
wine,36lg55,CondorKhan,5,Wed May 20 14:17:02 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the taste of good quality oak, at the right level, balanced with the fruit in the wine."
wine,36lg55,cnralex,4,Wed May 20 07:53:41 2015 UTC,"Think of it as a seasoning.  When used in the right amount, it adds complexity and harmony to the wine.  Too much, and that's all it tastes of.  Compare over-oaking to those dishes over in r/food where the OP tosses tons of garlic powder, dried herbs, salt, and pepper onto everything and calls that cooking.  But it really depends on the wine. DRC uses 100% new oak and the wines just swallow all of it up."
wine,36lg55,Ausonius89,3,Wed May 20 13:39:30 2015 UTC,"It's not just the oak that differentiates most producers ""$10 vs $30"" bottles - it can be multifactorial.  Source vineyards, yields, sugar levels of the fruit, fermentation technique, aging, etc.  While true most higher value wines may end up in oak barriques, while the lower end may be bottled straight out of stainless steel, it's important to consider all of the other variables.  That being said, I find that ""oak"" seems to be becoming the ""msg"" of wine making for too many."
wine,36lg55,liquid_massage,2,Wed May 20 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"I absolutely admire the taste of oak in good Burgundy, and pretty much all my favourite reds have a decent oak influence.  But there are notable exceptions. Some German and South African producers (Waterford, for example) make great reds with very little oak.   And then there are some cheap wines like Tour de Mandelotte Bordeaux Supérieur which have way too much oak. I wonder if they actually use chips or staves and overdo it."
wine,36lg55,Laplandia,2,Wed May 20 12:25:54 2015 UTC,"Oak barrels are expensive. A new American oak barrel will run you $400, and double that for French oak. That's why an oak-aged wine (assuming it's using new barrels, at least partially) will cost you more than a steel-fermented wine."

We opened an '04 not long ago; it had just a bit of volatile acidity but was otherwise a kaleidoscope of aromas and flavors. Slightly O/T: It must be nice to have your very own appellation."

wine,36jqu2,andtheodor,2,Wed May 20 09:31:52 2015 UTC,"Briefly, ever so- unfortunately, I think we caught it at the end of its window as it descended gracefully, but it took a nosedive around 40min. into drinking and lost its acidity almost entirely. At its peak, it was bright and floral, flirtatiously bold, but never quite reached that peak spot for me. However, I'll coup to being more of an Huet man myself- I'm still spoiled from a 1989 moelleux we had last winter."

wine,36jr40,Static90,6,Tue May 19 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"From the list you've given, I'd go with the Barbera.

Haut Brion, Dominus, Hundred Acre, Roy Estate, Moone Tsai and more, Philippe was an incredibly down to earth and humble guy. Tried his cab franc/merlot blend, which had tremendous structure and depth as well as his Melka cab which was jammed back with deep, dark fruits and subtle oak on the back end. I ordered his Sauvignon blanc which spent a ridiculous 24 months in French oak, so I'll let you know how that was.   He is strongly committed to keeping his own wine label small, preferring the freedom it allows him. That being said, if you're in Napa Melka is a stop well worth making (as is Roy Estate, which was equally accommodating and impressive during my stay)."

wine,36g4le,CondorKhan,3,Tue May 19 03:05:06 2015 UTC,"So heres’s an unusual one: Cara Nord Conca de Barberá 2013. Conca de Barberá is an up and coming appellation in Catalunya located northeast of Priorat. It mainly cultivates the usual suspects: Garnacha, Cab Sauv, Tempranillo, etc. This bottle in particular is a blend of 52% Garnacha, 34% Syrah and 14% Garrut, which I just found out this very second is actually the Catalan name for Mourvedre/Monastrell (this is a bit of a disappointment, as I bought the bottle just because I had no idea what Garrut was) . So this is basically a GSM blend and stylewise is squarely in the Southern Rhone style.   Pours inky deep purple. On the nose, violet and blackberries and some garrigue-y herbaceousness. The first sip was fantastic: the first thing that jumped out at me was its juicy freshness… it’s full of life and verve, with that sort of fresh acidity that makes the wine feel cool on the palate despite it being at room temperature. Loads of brambly berry fruit, along with licorice and herbs, with a touch of mint. Finish is very softly tannic. This is not unlike a really good Cotes du Rhone. Priced like one, too.  While we’re in Catalunya, I decided to whip together some roast chicken with Romesco sauce and it proved to be a fantastic pairing. If you haven’t tried Romesco, you should. It’s delish. I made a nice quantity of it so I’m working on the leftovers while I work down this bottle. I can’t complain."

There's something to be said about the experience of observing a great wine evolve in the glass minute to minute, or in the bottle over several hours or even days.  I remember opening an 03 Pontet-Canet a few weeks ago and having a glass a night. Day one was primary with almost spicy black fruit and scorched earth. But it evolved and mellowed over time, and by day five the profile was all sweet cedar and violets, and the fruit had taken a back seat. It was a great experience to watch the microcosm of the life of this wine over the week, seeing it take on an entirely new personality.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, the idea of decanting is one that's based on the idea of getting the perfect expression of a particular wine, and that, to me, is not nearly as interesting as the three dimensional perspective that you get by allowing it to evolve at its own pace.  At least, that's my two cents on it."
wine,36epnx,AnInquiringMind,4,Tue May 19 00:25:45 2015 UTC,"When I was in liquor retail and we had to push a batch of mediocre wine, or something from a poor vintage, I always used a decanter. It gives an average wine a fancy impression for the customer, and its like reaching in and dragging out every hidden scrap of flavour and bringing it up to the surface. To folks like us it will make a mediocre difference to a poor wine, but it makes a huge difference to its sales potential.  I actually never did it at home until recently. I didn't think I needed it. I got a spinner top for my birthday and have used it a few times. Standouts were a 2001 GSM, a 2008 Shiraz, and a 2013 Chardonnay. The Chardonnay in particular was one I'd had many times before but the decanting just transformed it, it really smoothed the oak and warmed the flavour. With the Shiraz it really brought out the New World characters (and I love a big jammy red). The GSM I can't really remember - it didn't last long at all."
wine,36epnx,LueyTheWrench,7,Tue May 19 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"There are two main reasons for decanting:   To open up wines that are closed either aromatically or on the palate (usually young wines but even some wines with age can need it for this reason). These wines can stay in the decanter for some time, up to a few hours (even 6 or more hours for extremely tight wines). You can serve them either from the decanter or pour it back into the bottle (""double decanting""). You usually see people decanting reds but many whites, especially from slow-evolving vintages, can benefit as well. To remove sediment from older wines. You should serve it immediately when doing this unless the wine is still closed, as many older wines can be fragile. Just make sure to rinse out the bottle if you double-decant. Obviously, older open whites never need decanting.   Decanters are also useful for:   Serving wine efficiently from large format bottles Serving wine blind"

wine,36epnx,Ausonius89,3,Mon May 18 21:00:27 2015 UTC,"A closed wine is one that isn't showing its potential, aromatically and/or on the palate.  A decant, which is basically just exposing more of the wine to oxygen, will usually reveal more of a wine's complexity (assuming it is hiding the material to begin with)."
wine,36epnx,caseyjosephine,5,Mon May 18 21:07:25 2015 UTC,"To add to this, I always think of ""tight"" or ""closed"" wines as being somewhat similar to wine tasted on a day when my allergies are acting up. That would mean less fruit on the nose despite obvious alcohol and tannin. In other words, the balance is off and the wine kind of hits you in the face with its more rambunctious qualities."

wine,36ffco,PistolMancer,3,Mon May 18 23:36:17 2015 UTC,"Washington wine is competitive with California. There are stellar Merlot, Syrah, Reisling & Cabernet wines coming out of WA. The pricing doesn't always max out like it does in California yet there are still some cults. The wine producing area is much smaller than CA so a lot of the production area is focused on finer wine compared to bulk wine. I am comparing WA to CA because it is my personal opinion that Washington ranks second only to CA. I would say: CA, WA, OR, NY, TX...   Waters Winery has a badass style of Syrah. It's more French style than Californian but definitely screams Washington. The fruit isn't overripe and the wines are higher acid which is a more reserved style.  Other great wine producers: Pepperbridge, Leonetti, Rotie Cellars, Charles Smith stuff is fun and creative, Quicelda Creek, J Bookwalter, Mark Ryan Winery."

It's mostly big, commercial producers, and only one or two. I think it's changing, but slowly. But for the minute, I would say that Washington wine finds its market at home."
wine,36ffco,Drunkenestbadger,2,Tue May 19 01:46:58 2015 UTC,"Washington comes across as a ""budget"" California.  The wines are competitively priced but lack the ultra premium producers that Napa/Sonoma are known for.  Oregon is limited in plantable vineyard area and in possible grape varieties due to climate (unlike Washington), but will make it on to more restaurant menus because of high regional quality.  Washington is still fairly new and has many impressive producers.  I look forward to seeing where the industry goes."
wine,36ffco,Doomaise,1 point,Tue May 19 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"As a Canadian on the Eastern side of the country, with a government controlled wine distributor (LCBO), I am exposed to maybe 25 different bottles of Washington wine a year.  Many of which are of lower/commercial quality.  That being said, I have had many Washington wines in restaurants, and in travels to the West side of the country.  And I'd say I actively seek out Washington wines.  I prefer cooler climate wines in general (same reason I'll seek out wines from Victoria, Australia).    I prefer a more balanced style of wine, and I think the cooler climates in Washington (relative to California), are more likely to yield a more balanced wine, or at the very least, less likely to yield a fruit bomb.    I perceive Washington wine, in general, as a high quality growing region (in the same light as California).    My favourite WA winery (and one of my favourite wineries period) is Gramercy Cellars.  I like their wines for their balance, food friendliness, and flavour intensity."
wine,36ffco,edwicks,1 point,Tue May 19 04:22:40 2015 UTC,"Hi I work in the UK wine Trade and have just finished my WSET Diploma.  My thoughts on WA wines and how they are perceived in the UK.  Firstly among the general population they are almost unheard of and i have never seen a WA (or even Oregan which is slightly more popular in the UK) wine in a major retailers.  Among more discerning UK consumers Pacific North West wines WA and OR are known to be of a high quality but the quantity imported is always very low.  Interestingly although WA has more land under vine it is more common to see a wine from Oregon.  Pinot Noir is king on imports from the Pacific Northwest any producer with a Burgundian link has an advantage; Domaine Drouhin Oregon is a great example - the link reassures the consumer.  What excites me personally about WA wines is the more diverse offerings (Syrah especially, but nice minty Cabs more poise than some comparably priced Californians).  The Wine merchant i work for stocks wines from Charles Smith and they are received well by our customers - but they are a small addition to the US range.  TL;DR  The wines of the Pacific Northwest have a tiny market in the UK.  Unheard of by the general public and untouched by the major retailers.  Connoisseurs and quality wine merchants know the wines to be of high quality but they are still rarely seen/purchased.  on the whole Oregon wines have a higher profile ATM with Oregan Pinot Noir with a link back to france being in vougue.  WA with more land under vine and a more diverse offering of wines available could do well in the future."

That might be a popular opinion, but I think that as a whole if someone asked me if I'd like to try a random Cab from CA, WA, or Boredeaux and they were all similarly priced, I'd go with Washington.   I'm in Northern California, so I'm inundated with juicy cabs with no character. Washington seems to have the fruit characteristics I like, while having enough minerality in general to give wine some balance and elegance.   That being said, I haven't had a lot of low priced wine from WA, so my view could be skewed. I just get tired of the same Napa cabs that aren't really memorable."

wine,36drg0,unclefire,11,Mon May 18 17:17:30 2015 UTC,"A wine cabinet isn't just a fridge. The reason standard fridges aren't suitable for long term ageing of wine is that the humidity in them is too low, leading to cork shrinkage, ullage and spoilage.  Purpose built wine fridges control the humidity as well as the temperature (and have higher set temperatures as the circa 5 Celsius temps in standard fridges will retard the ageing process).  Having said all that OP should easily be able to find something suitable at that price."

But maybe that all disappears when everything gets super sweet.  Anyways, taste-wise, lots of honey, raisin-y qualities.  It reminded me of a less complex German TBA.  BUT I thought the super fascinating thing about this was the tannins!!  I'm not good at describing tannins, but this was clearly tannic, much like some dry red wine.

wine,36bsfl,fishsupreme,5,Mon May 18 04:10:37 2015 UTC,"Two approaches: real world practical advice vs ""proper"" wine service and traditional knowledge as presented by reidel et al.    Who gives a fuck, pour wine in it and drink.  Go to Reidel, Zalto, Schott-Zweisel etc. websites, and look at the shapes for their various varietal-specific wine glasses. Generally, large bowls for red wines to promote aeration, aromatic expression, narrower glasses for white wines to focus aromatics at your schnoz, as whites are typically served at cooler temperatures, which limits the volatility of aromatic compounds. ""Flutes"" for champagne/sparkling, as they keep the carbonation in the wine longer (limited headspace). Is this legitimate? Are these differences detectable in a double-blind scenario? Is it even better to have better aromatic expression? Should I spend hard earned money on ""nice"" stemware? That's all for you to decide, but the theory is as stated.    Personally, I'd use the glass on the left as my ""personal"" wine glass (at home with me alone, or SO, minimal risk of breakage), and the stemless for company (likely cheaper wines, less focus on the product itself, thicker glass, etc.) You can use the stemless as water/drinking glasses as well.   My approach at home, for the gigantic wine-nerd with no qualms about wasting money. My ""nice"" glasses are zalto universals: http://i.imgur.com/v3WIHBv.jpg - they're smaller than what you'd expect for a red wine glass, but they're the thinnest stems I own, surprisingly durable, and feel great in your hand. Just have to go with smaller pours as the lower bowl portion is narrower. My ""company"" glasses, parties and the like, are Schott-Zwiesel Burgundy and Bordeaux: http://i.imgur.com/GEBLUhe.jpg .. also durable, thicker stems/bases. Also I use these for Napa Cabs or other huge young red wines that I really want to beat up in the glass to get them opened up. On the cheaper end of the ""nice"" spectrum, so if some drunk idiot drops one I'm not really worried about it. The zaltos ARE expensive, and I wouldn't put those in the hands of a drunk. Anything more casual (outdoors, crazy, beach, pool, whatever), I just bust out red solo cups. You can get plastic stemless, but they're really crappy and not worth the cabinet space imo.   I think Crate & Barrel have some knockoff that's very similar to the S&Z for a much cheaper price, but I haven't held them so I cannot personally attest to their quality/feel.   edit: various typos/clarity fixes because more coffee pls"

Your hand will warm the wine, so if your wine is a little too cold to start you might want to try to the glass on the right. Your hand will warm up the wine faster. That is also possible with the stemmed glass, but if you don't want your wine any warmer then definitely use the stemmed one, because avoiding having your hand right next to the wine is not possible with the squat glass (without setting it down, anyway). Temperature is always something to be mindful of."

wine,36b3vu,CondorKhan,2,Mon May 18 03:53:13 2015 UTC,"Feminine pinot is rare coming out of the new world regions the others have suggested. My experience is that if the regions are hot, like Russian river (on average) then they make bigger, bolder pinot. Of course it depends on the year. The regions that are cold, like central otago (on average) tend to leave the grapes out on the vine so long that they can end up with more heavy, bruised fruit characters. Of course that depends on producer and year.  One of the reasons (amongst many) Burgundy can make lighter, more feminine styles is they pick earlier and chapitalise to boost alcohol.   End result, ask at your local shop for pinot from cool climate regions and you will have a better chance. Look for lower alcohol (around 12-13%), bright red colour (colour deepens with a higher pH as a rough guide) and have fun!"
wine,36b3vu,bobjimthethird,2,Mon May 18 09:21:37 2015 UTC,"Russian River is a cool climate, cooler than Burgundy during the growing season. RRV has a maritime climate moderated by the ocean which results in a looong cool season. So on average RRV is cool, giving winemakers a large target of ripeness from which they can pick at a variety of acids, alcohols, and ripeness.  Central Otago is actually quite hot during the summer with frigid nights. New Zealand happens to be under the hole in the ozone layer That coupled with high elevation and aggressive sun exposure means Otago pinots see hearty tannin development. During harvest frost and rain can cut the harvests short.  Bruised fruit?  Burgundy picks at ripeness. Burgundy doesn't have the pleasure of an ocean to moderate the climate. Burgundy picks as late as they can generally speaking. In an optimal year they don't have to chap.  Very few producers consider 12-13 percent ripe, even in the old world.  Color is affected by lots of things, sun exposure, soil type, etc."

If you want to improve you need to learn your product, more that a few brand recommendations. Start to take some stuff home. Drink it. Learn what you like. Learn what you don't like.

Most wine in 5 cent sale are vineyard partner wines that you will never see for sale anywhere else. This doesn't make them bad but sure doesn't make them good. The QPR on these generally pretty average on these wines at the 5 cent sale price and awful at the normal price. This is a rule of thumb and not 100% true. When I first started drinking wine I found enjoyed quite a few of these but as time went in and started going to wineries and getting a taste for quality wine my enjoyment of these vineyard partner wines lessened.

wine,3654bk,agtcool,3,Sat May 16 07:53:56 2015 UTC,"To expand just a bit:  White: The miracle of the Assyrtiko grape is that it produces acidic juice even in the hot climate of Greece. The wines that result are both powerful and fresh-tasting. The best ones come from the island of Santorini. Like a lot of things, the wines used to be cheap. A good one will now set you back around $20, maybe a little more, and worth it.   Red: The Xinomavro grape, in the best hands, makes a red that might remind you of Barolo. The best ones come from the Náoussa appellation.   Yes, most of the retsina available in the U.S. is pretty awful, but there is such a thing as fresh, well-made retsina, and it can be delicious when served along side Greek cuisine (what a surprise, right?). I recall gulping Kourtaki Retsina at Santorini in the Greektown neighborhood of Chicago, and it was very good--reminded me a bit of a fresh fino sherry."

I could be wrong on the weight of the wine inside but I figure the whole bottle to weigh similarly.   The weight of the wine inside would depend on the specific gravity of the wine.

It will be more than 1 which is the sg of water.    yeah, no.  alcohol, as i'm sure you're aware has a SG way lower than water, and seeing wine is ~15% boozeahol, the SG of wine is less than 1.0; typically it's ~0.995 which doesn't sound like it's much lighter, but in winery setting, in a large 15000L tank, it's quite significant.  the dissolved solids and other large carbon chain chemical content of wine is not nearly enough to tip the scales against the 15% booze content.  the SG of grape juice is over 1.0 (1.070-1.100ish) before fermentation, but then there's a looooooot of mass lost to CO2."

wine,362itx,drawsmcgraw,4,Sat May 16 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"Silver Oak is a very popular cabernet producer that produces two wines, an Alexander Valley and a Napa Cabernet.  They only use American Oak and is often derided because the wine often has an overpowering jolly rancher taste to it.  It used to be a very expensive and culty wine but now is sort of a midrange high end Cab ($85 price point, which hasn't changed in years).    The wine maker Dan Baron actually says he tries to think about the wine over the course of the entire glass and sort of ignores the rating systems that are based solely on a single sip or so.  Though Coke is by far more popular than Pepsi, Pepsi regularly beats Coke in taste tests.  However, over the course of a full bottle, Coke is preferred.  Dan Baron says he tries to make his wines in that manner - focusing on the development of the taste over the entire glass.  However, many say that the overly aggressive use of 100% American Oak and the typical fruitbomb Napa Cabernet style leads to an overwhelmingly jolly rancher taste to the wine."

wine,35yzht,Gnjd_85,10,Thu May 14 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"This is a bottle we have on display at the restaurant I work at (we keep it next to a bottle of 1929 Dom Perignon) and there's a couple things we've found a little puzzling about it. More on that later.  The official story is that it was a party favor given to guests at a party hosted by Princess Stephanie of Belgium. However, we are a bit puzzled about the 1889 written on it. Our best guess is that the true vintage of the wine is from 1889 and it was re-labeled for the party in 1906. Whoever possessed this bottle probably wrote the proper vintage on it so they could keep track of it. But that's really just conjecture. If anyone happens to know anything about it or have any sources about antique wine from European royalty that i might be able to dig through, i would love to read it."
wine,35yzht,blas3nik,6,Fri May 15 01:57:11 2015 UTC,"I see interesting bottles quite a lot as part of my job and this is one of the most interesting I've ever seen. I know it's not yours but the restaurant's, and don't know where you are based but I would really recommend someone going to an auction house with a wine department and seeing what they can find out about this. What I can tell you is that both 1899 and 1906 were fantastic vintages for Tokaji. Tokaji also lasts extremely well and the proper stuff is still drinking very nicely from even earlier than this, I've never had the pleasure but apparently the 1811s are fantastic! The tricky thing here is not knowing exactly what quality level this was to begin with but I would be surprised if Princess Stephanie was serving any old crap I guess, and really anything that was a half serious Tokaji from either 1899 or 1906 should be fantastic to drink now really. Is it known when the party is supposed to have been?"
wine,35yzht,Gnjd_85,3,Fri May 15 08:50:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, in the five minutes I've spent on this, I could dig up this for you, mostly from wikipedia.  The wine is probably from Bodrogolaszi, a Hungarian little town right next to Tokaj, the center of the Tokaj wine region. Princess Stephanie was married to a guy named Elemér Lónyai (See the bottle) in 1900, who was heir of the count family of that exact town (they still have their mansion there btw, see the bottle for the picture as well, although it does not look that nice today). As far as I know ""Grand cru"" type wines from there were made solely of Furmint grapes, and they are excellent material for the famous Aszú wines, so I'd guess this was (or is?) a very sweet one.  I could not find any interesting events about the couple from those years though, but since they got married in 1900, I'd guess that the number 1889 is not directly related to them (they hadn't even met by then). My guess would be that this wine were not made for a party, but rather as a ""usual"" drink for them.  I'll try and dig out more, if you want.  Source: wikipedia and Hungarian school systems teaching history :)"
wine,35yzht,hendricks_,1 point,Fri May 15 10:33:23 2015 UTC,"What's confusing me slightly is the fact that as far as I know most serious Tokaji even from this far back would traditionally say which level sweetness it was in terms of a number of Puttonyos (or an Essencia, which I'm sure it would say if it was as its the top level so I don't think this would be one) assuming its a proper aszú wine. On the other hand, the use of the term 'Grand Cru' really should mean that it comes from one of the absolutely best vineyards (I think there might only be two of them)  and it would be surprising if they would be used for many non aszú wines. A problem is that words like Grand Cru would not have been very strictly controlled at the time so its hard to know for sure that it is what it should be, but I would say the royal connection makes that very likely.  In short- unfortunately I don't think there's any way to be absolutely sure but I would be 90% confident this is a pretty high level sweet aszú wine from a great vintage and a top vineyard, that would be absolutely marvelous to drink now. I hope someone gets the chance to."
wine,35yzht,andtheodor,1 point,Fri May 15 12:24:14 2015 UTC,I'm just guessing here but the grand cru part of the label perhaps suggests that the wine is perhaps from alsace where historically the pinot gris grape was known as tokay d'alsace.
wine,35yzht,kaseycarpenter,2,Mon May 18 14:30:16 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought, but then I googled the placename ""Bodrog Olazsi"" and it's literally in Tokaj."

You'll notice that the article didn't even try to define it concretely.   Minimal intervention in the vineyard and cellar with low or no sulfur? Ok, I've had some natural wines that were absolutely brilliant - a bottle of Domaine de la Grande Colline Cornas 2011 last night had a fantastic aromatic nose and beautifully pure fruit (if a slightly rustic and short finish)  But you are far more likely to get a bad bottle of natural wine than ""normal"" wine, especially if it has traveled far.

But I feel like a large share of producers of higher-end wines - and perhaps most producers in places like Spain - take a relatively hands-off approach, in terms of not adding powdered tannins and such.

Or what constitutes artificial flavor?  If you want to take a gamble on a wine that maybe spoiled/premoxed, and which shows no winemaker influence...by all means buy natural wine."

But for some of the things they're asking of wine, it's a little ridiculous. Look at hydrogenated soybean oil in the Snickers bar. Production of cooking oils require hexane solvents, chemical degumming, bleaching and alkaline washes. That's along the same lines as using bentonite as a fining agent in wine. I won't even touch on production of corn syrup.  For most wine products out there, ingredients would be what? Grapes, water, acid, and maybe natural food coloring? Fining, stabilizers etc...those are all used to (probably) a greater extent in production of the milk (and subsequently cocoa), soy, corn syrup, lactose etc that's in a Snickers bar...and they're not required to be listed by the FDA."

wine,3607hl,pbrooks19,7,Fri May 15 00:04:39 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/lbiFdUa  Feudo Principi di Butera Nero d'Avola 2012 (Sicilia DOC) - $17 AUD  Wine pours a beautiful deep garnet with purpleish tinge, the first sign of youth. Good legs. Nose is clean with notes of plum and bitter chocolate, a pleasant if strange metallic hint, and a little spice competing in the background. On the palate, pleasing acidity but overwhelming young tannins, a little stemmy, quite chalky, very coarse. Needs some time in the bottle. My first time tasting a Nero d'Avola - would have guessed Merlot.  Overall opinion - well priced, easy drinking red, but unfortunately flat and chalky. With 5-10 years in the cellar could be a winner, but I'm unlikely to ever find out. Would not recommend to anyone but a merlot drinker looking for something different - better options at that price for most palates."
wine,3607hl,madkent,4,Fri May 15 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"Campo di Marzo Nero d'Avola, 2013  First off, I want to say that I was really disappointed that I couldn't find a frappato in my region. I searched and searched. I've heard so many good things, and now it's become my quest.   Nonetheless, I was happy to find the Nero d'Avola I tasted. Upon inspection, the wine was clear but dark ruby red. Thin body with light legs. Odors were not strong, but fair - blackberries with an astringent tone. Not complex, and largely fruity.  Initial sips brought the fruit - blackberries and red grape - very juicy. A pretty simple wine, with little complexity apart from the alcohol. Further sips and then gulps confirmed the light body but no real secondary flavors. This was the Popeye of Wines - It was what it was.  Not that it was bad - on the contrary, it was quite drinkable. As an accompaniment to a light lunch or an afternoon outing, it would go well. I paid $12 for the bottle, and was not disappointed. If I were to find a red wine for someone who would have trouble with more complex wines, I'd have no trouble getting this one again."

I also had a preconception that this would be a light red wine, but it isn't.  It's more similar to Rhône blends.

You fine folks were super kind and pointed me towards something you thought I would like: Rioja Gran Reserva.  So this is what I went for! Bodega Classica, Hacienda Lopez de Haro Gran Reserva 2008.  The colour was deep red, almost purple. I'm not sure if this is a characteristic of Tempranillo? I like it, though.  And it was AWESOME. Lots of jammy black fruit, blackberries, blueberries. The tannins were smoothed out, once again I don't know if this has to do with the (relative) aging, or the grape itself.  It had notes of mushroom and leather behind the fruit, that were very pleasant. It's what I really like about older wine.  Acidity was balanced, and the wine was quite lenghty.   I had paired it with ribeye, and a tomato mozzarella salad. Honestly, could not have asked for more! It held up with the meat perfectly well, did just fine with the tomato's acidity as well.   It was a really good experience. I'm looking forward to being a Spain aficionado, from here onwards!"

wine,35ztnj,my_stats_are_wrong,6,Thu May 14 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"The dryness is due to tannin. Pinot Noir is a thin-skinned grape, which means it's not usually that tannic, so you should be asking for a fuller-bodied Pinot Noir with more tannic structure.   The fire you feel might be alcohol. Higher alcohol usually means longer growing seasons and warmer climate, which translates into New World.  I love spice in Pinot Noir, and I believe that might be the best descriptor for the special bite you tasted. Ask for a spicy Pinot Noir and you should have that covered.  tl/dr I'd ask for a fuller bodied, higher alcohol, spicier California Pinot, and my recommendation to you would be to try some from Carneros (Southern Napa/Sonoma) and Russian River (Northern Sonoma). Some specific ones to try: Domaine Chandon, Acacia, Saphhire Hill, and Cartograph."
wine,35ztnj,caseyjosephine,2,Thu May 14 22:48:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all of this.  Also, certain NZ Pinots might deliver. I have found Craggy Range Pinot Noir to do me well if this is the style of Pinot I want, or sometimes Oregon Pinot."

wine,35ztnj,agtcool,2,Fri May 15 03:25:07 2015 UTC,"Any idea what the price of the bottle was?   If it was under 100$ you can rule out Burgundy. Most red Burgundy that would illicit this sort of a response, have tannins, and enough alcohol to leave a burn would be pretty specific and expensive.  If you gave us a price range on this and we are correct in our assumption that it's Napa/Sonoma pinot, there's a good chance we can figure out producer as long as you'd recognize the label if you saw it again"

They were doing Art Series Chardonnay in 1980 so it probably was available then, so this is therefore not their top wine of this grape.  In terms of value? Limited in my view. Drinkability? Hard to say - this isn't going to blow minds I'd expect but you might get a pleasant surprise. It probably has peaked already though I'd think. Older aussie pinot can go a little bit vegetal and mushroomy in my experience but if you're a pinot boff you'll probably find a way to enjoy that."

I can't actually find much info on the wine, I don't think a lot of it is made and it seems very difficult to buy.  It therefore might be more valuable than I originally already proposed, but you aren't going to be a millionaire from it.

If memory serves, Leeuwin were one of the first producers to plant Pinot in MR. Quite a few others planted Pinot Noir as well and quickly realised that the climate and conditions are not making good wine.   I am worried this won't show well as the Pinot I've tasted from MR, even crafted by some of MR's great winemakers (Moss Wood) for example are pretty disappointing and lack acidity and structure. They tend to be fruity but rather dull and not conducive to ageing.   Most of the wineries that planted Pinot back in the day ripped their vines up or grafted them to other varieties. Leeuwin don't make a Pinot currently for good reason. Would love to hear back from you once you open it.  It's not worth much however, except as a curiosity to a Leeuwin Estate fanboy."

As u/sgarbusisadick said many producers in the region initially planted Pinot only to rip it out or graft over later. Whilst Leeuwin does still grow Pinot they use it for their sparkling white.

wine,35wxxw,OBAFGKM17,2,Thu May 14 09:56:32 2015 UTC,You'd pick pairings over the chance to drink bottles with 30 years of meticulous aging? I love a great pairing but they usually don't hold up to an $800 wine budget.

wine,35wxxw,Muppet_Mower,2,Thu May 14 18:13:01 2015 UTC,Fair enough but you could certainly bounce ideas off your somm.  I was at the French Laundry recently and had an idea of a $600 for 2 wine budget. My friend had the vegetarian tasting menu and I had the traditional omnivore courses. The pairings were uninspired even at several hundred dollars per person. Even three Michelin stars and a Coravin with endless cartridges doesn't always equate to truly luxurious pairings that match the food. We ended up eviscerating our wine budget (hello 16x markup and $150 corkage!) but had amazing wines that were beautifully aged.

If memory serves, we housed a 1986 red Burg and a Chassagne-Montrachet from 2004, maybe. Their Burgundy list is even better now, so personally, I'd get a white and a red Burg if I went there again, and just drink those through the meal."

wine,35wxxw,VAGINA_MASTER,1 point,Thu May 14 08:16:41 2015 UTC,"I'll play.  Start with a dry or off-dry Riesling. You'll need some somm guidance - $125 Or 2004 Blain-Gagnard White Burg (Chardonnay) - $350 Then E.Guigal La Mouline 1993 Côte Rotie Syrah - $625 Or Château Léoville Las Cases 1983 Bordeaux - $405  As others have said, you'll want to talk to your somm. For the final choice you'd be between the 1970, 1978, and 1983. I've had the 1970 out of a 375ml recently and it was long gone. You may get lucky and have a somm that has recently tasted one or more vintages and can weigh in.  Sounds like you're in for a treat!"
wine,35wxxw,flitcroft,2,Thu May 14 14:56:34 2015 UTC,I did something very similar the first time I went to EMP.  We started off with a 1989 La Mouline and then moved to the 1990. Worked very well with the food.
wine,35wm0e,pandashpace,3,Thu May 14 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"Winejobs.com for employment even though networking is way more effective.   If you are a member of the guild of sommeliers, the website shows you who is also a member near you.   I also go to local tastings as much as I can. Get on local wine store email lists to find out about new products and tastings. That will lead to other tastings and it will snow ball from there.   Doing this, I went from passing my level one somm test to tasting with some of the best in Dallas and becoming a wine distributor rep in six months.   Hope this helps. Cheers!"

I am currently working in the industry but what my goal was with this post is bringing up the idea of the creation of a thread or maybe even a separate subreddit like r/winejobs , r/wineindustry, or r/winebusiness   I have used wine jobs, am certified with the court, and am fairly active in the wine community where I live, but I was thinking of something less formal. Like a section or subreddit more dedicated to the industry and learning about different sides and roles of the wine business. What is your opinion on this?"

So if you want to pour more, think about 4-6 bottles, which will give you about a glass or two for everyone.   What you can buy is so dependent on where you live and what's available in your state. I would find a good wine store and ask them for a $40-50 suggestion and get 4-6 bottles depending on how much you think you'll need.  If you ask your retailer for ""Grower Champagne"" these are typically better value. For instance, you could get an NV Chartogne-Taillet Brut for around $40. These wines are stunning and I think outperform your typical bigger brands like Veuve Clicquot."
wine,35wqij,heavyhandedpour,2,Thu May 14 04:27:14 2015 UTC,"Would 2 magnums work?  I found a Magnum of Veuve Clicquot NV for $90.  Is this a good quality champagne?  I don't need it to be super nice, but something respectable and enjoyable."
wine,35wqij,budissy,1 point,Thu May 14 04:33:01 2015 UTC,2 magnums would work.  It's like getting 4 bottles. Veuve Clicquot is a very respectable brand. You can also chose Moet.

If you just want a Champagne style sparkling wine, you can look at New World regions using Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grapes and méthode traditionnelle. They'll taste great and be a better value than something like Veuve or Moet.  If you have access to California wines, check out the Carneros region (which spans both Napa and Sonoma; big producers include Mumm, Domaine Chandon, and Domaine Carneros)."

Anyway, your safest bet is to get yourself to a small, local wine store with knowledgeable staff, tell them that you'd like to find something similar to Smoking Loon in the $20-$50 range, and see what they suggest. Wine stores tend to be surprisingly inexpensive: my favorite one has a table of well-curated bottles from all over the world under $15.  You might have some luck with the ""big"" Napa reds, especially those that have spent a significant amount of time in oak. Caymus comes to mind, although it's just above your price range. Also, maybe check out some of Beringer and Mondavi's higher end stuff, as well as Coppola's Claret: the style will be similar, but a little more refined."

I've been told that some of those really cheap wines have other additives in them to get the taste right.  A few I can think of that are not too expensive: - Cline - Ancient Vine Zin  (usually awesome!!!).  Cashmere ( a blend)

That is absolutely incorrect and comes across as a personal disliking rather than a legitimate issue with the glasses themselves.  If you can better describe this apparent lack of enjoyment then we might actually be able to get somewhere with this discussion.

wine,35v9ud,drew_fire,1 point,Wed May 13 21:00:51 2015 UTC,"I did, that was that initial burst of flavor. It calmed down a bit now. I was very excited to try it as it's butique  (370 cases made) but I prefer more restrained and balanced cabs. Regardless it's smooth, easy going and hides 14.5 alc well. Pairing wise, anything with bold flavors; red meat with a heavy sauce like blue cheese."

I think it's a vanity project/contract wine.  If you look at their website they try to give the impression they actually have vineyards, but later they mention ""sourcing"" fruit (from vineyards in the same areas as other Napa Wine Co wines)  I have a bottle (it was one of the last while I was a member of the club there) so I'm not hoping that it's bad... I just don't expect much out of it.  I found the wines at that tasting room nearly universally disappointing, with a few exceptions (Blackbird, Hoopes)  Edit: Parenthetical"

wine,35wqrs,fresasandcrema,6,Thu May 14 03:43:44 2015 UTC,"I double u/LueyTheWrench on the dry riesling and creamy chardonnay.  Have you tried pairing white wines with food? Oysters and Chablis, foie and sauternes, grilled lobster and buttery chardonnay, shellfish and Sauvignon blanc. Red wines generally do not have the synergy with these dishes accomplished by whites. I usually have more fun pairing white wine with my food, though if I'm pounding bottles on a night I'm feeling froggy, I am right there with you slamming down (red) riojas and prioratos.  Also, I will take txakolina if I'm trying to pass out in the sun, over any red wine any day of the week. What I'm saying is you can probably find some contexts within your lifestyle in which going white is more appropriate, if you are motivated to appreciate white wine."
wine,35wqrs,atleastbepolite,5,Thu May 14 05:18:31 2015 UTC,"Just like others have mentioned, if you want to stay within Spain, Albariño is a great bet, and many will have incredible acidity, complexity, and not a drop of sugar. You could also try Godello, another grape from Galicia, a fairly new (past 20 years) varietal in terms of popularity that is sometimes blended with Treixadura (a common varietal in the vinho verde you like.)   Verdejo's from Rueda & Txacoli are also good ideas.   Some aged whites from Rioja will be incredible wines but many won't have the bang/buck compared to these other wines and regions."
wine,35wqrs,LaRoja1837,1 point,Thu May 14 12:57:45 2015 UTC,"You just haven't found the one you like, if you're into the Spanish reds you probably just have a higher standard.   If you're feeling like opening your horizons, you'll have to take risks. My go to whites are either a good Chardonnay with a couple of years and some oak, I like them creamy and full bodied, or if I'm feeling something lighter, Riesling offers similar texture/flavours and more acidity, which makes it really good with food.   If you're into Spanish reds I would say look at dry-style Rieslings, but be sure they're right on dry end of the spectrum, I find a lot of local (Australian) Rieslings are trending slightly sweeter and it's driving me insane."

I'm sure other redditors can help out.  If you ever have the opportunity, try one from Margaret River, Australia. The Leeuwin Art Series is my favourite, its about 20 bucks and if you can get your hands on an 09 you might just find heaven. Other notable regions are Mt Barker or the Eden or Clare Valleys."
wine,35wqrs,agtcool,1 point,Thu May 14 04:35:13 2015 UTC,I really like rebholz (green bottle) it's like 16$ and it's pretty sweet awesome. Donnhoff trocken is my favorite for about 20$.
wine,35wqrs,agtcool,1 point,Thu May 14 06:27:59 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say since I don't know you, but most of getting to know wine is to just drink it. Fortunately for you white wine is significantly less expensive than red, so experimenting shouldn't be too costly.   If you're into Spanish red wine it could stand to reason that you'd enjoy the white. Try some Lopez de Heredia viura. It's not cheap, but you can get some delicious aged white wine that will be impossible to classify as bland. Albarino is also great, slightly floral and mineral driven (many available for under 20$).   Also, to sum up, if you are a red drinker heftier whites might be your thing so definitely try California chardonnay, viognier, and Australian Chardonnay at some point."
wine,35wqrs,mvicsmith,1 point,Thu May 14 06:34:50 2015 UTC,I have had vinho verde and liked it a lot. I think I'll try Albariño.

If you lean towards dryer wines, I would definitely suggest sauvignon blanc (this took me a while to adjust to, but over time I have appreciated it more and more. Now I love it.) or Godello. I would also recommend trying some dry roses.  Have you had Tranche's rose? Here is a picture."
wine,35wqrs,kibble,1 point,Thu May 14 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to reds as well, but I do like a white or rose' on occasion.  There are some good varietals that are worth trying beyond the typical Chardonnay or Savignon Blac, etc.   Clearly a different taste from many reds.     I like Malvasia and Chenin blanc and there are some blends worth getting.  There is at least one good Dry Riesling from the Temecula region in Cali as well.  I tried a white Gamay in france last year that was pretty darn good too (I think it was Gamay)"

wine,35tmii,agtcool,5,Thu May 14 03:07:34 2015 UTC,This website is the single best resource available for studying wine. It's geared toward people working their way through the court of masters (if you sign up for level 1 you get a free year membership).   Also $150/yr is very little in the grand scheme.

They are now adding even more comprehensive guides for select regions. I use this site every day, not just for studying and I don't know of another resource that quite touches the site's level of updated content.  That being said, it's usually quite dry, designed more for people who are in the industry (specifically those who are preparing for the CMS certifications) and the maps kind of suck. If you just want to get more in depth knowledge, but want a more casual approach, there are countless books that I would start with. What books do you own so far?   My first two recommendations - Kevin Zraly's Complete Wine Course is absolutely hands down, the best first book you can buy imo, and then I would get The World Atlas of Wine for the maps and there's lots of good info too. You can get an ereader version for ipad or whatever that's interactive and very reasonable price wise, though the physical book is easier to browse."
wine,35tmii,atleastbepolite,3,Wed May 13 14:18:39 2015 UTC,"As already mentioned, if you sign up for the Level I through CMS, you get a year free membership. If you plan to enroll in this, but money is as issue, I would just save up and check out the recommended reading for the exam first. The study guides are very well-written, but having the background provided by a source such as the World Atlas of Wine or Zraly's text would definitely give you more traction as you use GuildSomm's guides, which I found to be a little more thorough and less of an easy read. In the meantime, they put out a fantastic podcast that is open to the public, in case you weren't already aware.  I am certified, and I would certainly pay for membership in preparation for Level III, but I am planning on exhausting all of the study guides before my membership expires, though they do add new expanded study guides. They do publish articles much more frequently and some of them are good, though the articles alone certainly do not justify the membership the way the study guides do. I do not plan on renewing my membership unless I find the updated content and networking features more useful to me than they have been."

Wonderful Barolo 2000 that had aged a lot slower than I had expected. Impressive acidity that still let the fruit feel ripe.   A comment on Andrea Oberto: These wines strike me as enjoyable, balanced wines cast in a decidedly modern style with jam-like sweetness and a sheen of oak.

You have some pretty special bottles. If you are planning on drinking them yourself, don't be afraid to open them for a taste and then reseal. The wine can handle it.  The vintage on wine 2 either refers to the year it was bottled or when the solera was started.

wine,35pvhl,whiteynumber2,9,Tue May 12 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a geologist and wine drinker so hopefully I can help! As far as earthquakes go I imagine there will be little change in the terroir of a region. At the most it will sort the soil by the movement and possible leave you with a coarser band of surface material, but I doubt the effect is that large.   One interesting factor may be liquefaction. This is where the frequency of the earthquake seismic waves causes the ground to effectively behave like a liquid, causing some of the weird phenomena you see associated with the ground during earthquakes. Whilst this produces some cool structures for a geologist to look at, I doubt it will have much of an effect on the terroir.  As others have pointed out, the products of an earthquake are more likely to have an effect. The influx of material from landslides could introduce a new soil profile and severely affect what a vineyard has to work with. The terroir will be inherently linked to the bedrock geology, in that if you have a rock such as granite, you may expect to see more potassium than in another area where the rocks are different. An earthquake won't help to change this in our time span.  So in summary, it's not really going to have a massive effect. Old world producers aren't suddenly going to be killing themselves because their distinctive terroir has been taken away by an earthquake. Although it could have interesting local effects. I'm not expert on the wine side of it, but would really love to get into that industry if there's actually any prospect of employment or study into these kind of questions."

It would most likely ruin a soil profile over a very localised area and would be quite unlikely to give a specific trend to anyone one vintage in the earthquake zone."
wine,35pvhl,Muppet_Mower,3,Wed May 13 05:55:57 2015 UTC,I dont think so. Maybe if the grounhd split open and lava gushed forth.
wine,35pvhl,winemule,2,Tue May 12 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"This one can probably be easily answered by any winemaker with vineyards/structures on Mount Etna, which never seems to stop erupting."

wine,35pvhl,Young_Zaphod,3,Wed May 13 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"The earthquake itself probably wouldn't have much impact but I imagine things like mudslides, sinkholes, etc may result occur and shift soil structure. After the earthquake in Napa some places saw shifts in well locations, so that could have an effect as well."
wine,35pvhl,winemule,3,Tue May 12 15:28:03 2015 UTC,"Based on the earthquake in Napa in August 2014, the massive effect was mostly property damage. There's a lot written about the effects of soil liquefaction, but almost exclusively in terms of the stability of the ground after a quake and what that means for construction/reconstruction. I can't find anything on what it might mean for the physical structure and mineral makeup of the soil and the critters that live in it."
wine,35pvhl,thefoolwhofollowshim,2,Tue May 12 15:57:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like the people at Hirsch could answer this question, seeing as their vineyard sits right on the San Andreas Fault.  My guess is not much, outside of potentially shifting water resources.  After the Napa quake, a bunch of streams that had dried up because of the drought started running again."
wine,35pvhl,GahMatar,2,Tue May 12 16:38:10 2015 UTC,I would assume that minor repair to trellising might also be in order.
wine,35pvhl,ChalkyTannins,2,Tue May 12 18:22:11 2015 UTC,"If there was a big enough earthquake, i'd imagine dense material (big rock, iron?) goes deeper and less dense material floats to the top?"
wine,35pvhl,skyshadow42,1 point,Tue May 12 17:23:26 2015 UTC,That isn't really how earthquakes work.
wine,35pvhl,zombiegodzilla,2,Sat May 16 02:08:28 2015 UTC,"As another geologist, basically with an earthquake you are just shaking around the stuff that's already at the surface so most of the time nothing is moved in or out of your vineyard.   In some extreme cases you might raise or lower your vineyard by a couple of metres in elevation which could affect things a little.  A landslide,  mud flow or volcanic eruption  could bring in totally different materials and affect your terroir.  If you are near a bug fault it's possible salty water might come out of it during a quake and wreak havok with your vines."
wine,35pvhl,skyshadow42,2,Tue May 12 20:58:56 2015 UTC,I think the main impact of an earthquake would be more in winery equipment getting wrecked and fewer blending options due to barrels being destroyed.
wine,35q5ev,nutsngum,4,Tue May 12 16:27:23 2015 UTC,"""The Wines of Burgundy"" by Clive Coates is a great reference and provides an excellent and thorough introduction to the region as well as short profiles of a huge number of domaines. It was most recently updated only in 2008 but the info in general is still good (it's not like *** growers like DRC, Roumier, Rousseau, and Mugnier have suddenly declined...)  In a nutshell, Bordeaux is all about Châteaux blending and creating a consistent product that follows the house style.  Burgundy is the extreme side of terroir-consciousness where the grower's style is important but not as important as the personality of the vineyard.  These mentalities are quite apparent in the classification systems of each region - Bordeaux is classified by châteaux, Burgundy by vineyard.  Of course, this is a simplification - there are numerous exceptions and it really is more of a spectrum of philosophies but that is how I would describe the main differences."

The result is similar to that of the ice wine process, but suitable for warmer climates. The classic method dries clusters of grapes on mats of straw in the sun, but some regions dry them under cover, on roofs, or on modern racks, while some hang up the grapes or leave them to dry on the vine. The technique dates back to pre-Roman times, and most production of these wines has been in Northern Italy, Greece, and the French Alps. However producers in other areas are now starting to experiment with the method.

That said, Silver Oak in general is not very well respected for the reasons Grandpa mentioned.   Just as a side note, I would probably move into trying Old World wines from where you're at now, if you haven't already.

wine,35nb5r,jm2222,1 point,Sat May 16 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"We stopped at four different wineries. Goldeneye had the nicest tasting area. The back patio had a spectacular view of the vineyard, their tastings are setup like table service. The wines (mainly Pinots) are excellent but definitely not value priced. Tasting fess was 20$ a person. We stopped at Brutocao next. The tasting room was nothing special but they had a ton different options, a little something for everybody there ranging from cabs all the way down to several desert wines. Tasting was free, staff was nice and prices were very reasonable. We stopped at Navarro next. Tasting room was laid out to attract a younger crowd with rock music blaring. Again lots of choices, we ended up buying some interesting whites here (we are not normally big white wine drinkers). I have had some nice Pinots produced by these guys and some of the reds were tried pretty good but didn't knock our socks off. Prices were mid range. Last stop was Husch. The tasting room was small, a couple that we met in their loved their Chardonnay, which we did try and was pretty good however they were serving a Cab that was relatively full bodied with a very smooth finish and was well worth the $24 price tag. Theses wineries are all on the main drag and there were plenty more to hit we just ran out of time. If you are in Santa Rosa, you have both Alexander Valley close by and Dry Creek as well. Lots great wineries in those areas too. Enjoy your trip."

Try to get a appointment at Kosta Browne which is right at that intersection. Head North up 116 and there you'll have Dehlinger, Merry Edwards, and Russian River Vinyards. Take 116 all the way to Guernville and then turn back East, where you'll pass Korbel (amazing lunch spot), then in that vicinity: Williams Seylem, Gary Farell, Joseph Swan, Sonoma-Cutrer, and Hook and Ladder."

wine,35lsv2,andtheodor,22,Mon May 11 15:38:32 2015 UTC,Tokaji. I think the high acid could cut the cream and the ginger aspect of the botrytis would lend an Asian flavor profile.
wine,35lsv2,burnsbrightest,4,Mon May 11 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"+1. Similarly, Sauternes would also work. You absolutely have to go with a very sweet wine, and noble rot would help.

wine,35lsv2,Kujo_A2,9,Mon May 11 22:03:38 2015 UTC,"It's funny to see this question. I create wine pairings at a restaurant known for tasting menus and a matcha dessert came on recently creating a similar dilemma for us. My knee-jerk reaction was a dessert sake. We tried it with a fairly high end one and it worked pretty well, but then we tried a sparkling sake and it was magic. It complemented the matcha very well and the bubbles cut through the richness.   If it's just ice cream by itself I'm not entirely sure any wine it going to knock it out of the park, but if you have like a cake with matcha ice cream I suggest looking into this option.  Full Disclosure: We did, after a while, start using a cadillac wine when we ran out and it worked pretty well for different reasons (it had a goofy astringency to it that may not be typical of the region though)"

wine,35lsv2,michaelcuz,2,Mon May 11 18:02:51 2015 UTC,I think typically when you're eating something sweet you want the wine to be as sweet if not sweeter than the dessert.  Otherwise the wine would taste foul and fall flat in comparison.  I would suggest a late harvest pinot gris.
wine,35lsv2,thewhits,2,Mon May 11 18:14:53 2015 UTC,Or ice wine like Inniskillin

But why go to an expensive restaurant then? There are plenty of places where the food is great and plentiful and the wine is cheap. Better to go to a less expensive restaurant and get the bloody best of everything than a pricier joint and play it safe."

wine,35m838,agtcool,7,Mon May 11 18:44:22 2015 UTC,Saying the word split has certain connotations in restaurants and pouring wine for two in one glass is a little tacky. I suggest just getting the two pairings. Like I said if you're already spending 300$  on dinner (assuming no supplements) it seems silly to quibble over a 70$ wine pairing (which is a pretty damn good price in this atmosphere).

We paired with 2 of the 5 courses and the first pairing was made to work well with the second and 3rd course.  May or may not be an option though.  It wasn't the full experience, but it was really nice as well.  The full pairing probably provides some better value though."

wine,35m838,shiversaint,-1,Mon May 11 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with getting half glasses. Otherwise just get the paired wine for the course that you think you will enjoy the most. Don't forget dessert, they can be phenomenal with the right glass of wine :)"
wine,35m838,Ausonius89,2,Mon May 11 18:48:29 2015 UTC,Paired glasses are almost always partial pours.
wine,35m838,heavyhandedpour,8,Mon May 11 23:34:17 2015 UTC,"A good wine pairing with a tasting menu can be a revelatory experience. I've had a couple disappointing experiences where the pairings were ""decent"" and the portions skimpy, but I've had some mind-blowing, eye-opening meals this way as well.  Plus, most importantly, no one wine will go with everything."
wine,35m838,bwilliams18,3,Mon May 11 18:39:26 2015 UTC,"WHOA WHOA WHOA.  The Ledbury has one of the best picked and well priced menus in the country. Do not buy standard big names and you'll do well. There are plenty of gems on that list.  But speak to Anja, the Sommelier there - you can pay £50 and take your own bottle.  I would take the pairings if you aren't that into wine though."
wine,35m838,heavyhandedpour,5,Tue May 12 08:18:34 2015 UTC,"I'm often wary of wine pairings unless I know the Wine Director or sommelier personally and know they're pouring cool/interesting things. That's often where the heaviest markups lie (relative to their beverage cost per glass).  This list has pretty average markups for a restaurant of this caliber.  If you don't want to drink a lot, half bottles are always an option.  3 half bottles will give around 4 glasses of wine for each of you and you'll be able to try a few different wines.  Go for half bottles of the Chartogne Taillet Cuvee Saint Anne Brut (great grower Champagne) for £39 , Billaud-Simon Chablis Vaillons 2010 for £35, and the Pierre Gonon Saint Joseph 2010 for £39. All of these are delicious wines and you'll be well under the cost of the wine pairings. If you want more wine, then you can order a second white or red by the glass and you'll have enough left in the budget for dessert wine too."
wine,35m838,jeebidy,1 point,Mon May 11 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Unless the somm has opened some wines up special to go with the menu, I would opt out of the tasting. So many nice restaurants  recently just select from their BTG, and the markup is higher on the tasting menu (in other words you could pay less by just ordering half glasses). That being said, if the reverse is true, and the somm opens up wine not on the BTG specifically to go with the tasting menu, it probably would be interesting and good.  Their half bottle list has some good options. I usually dine with my wife and we go half bottle white, maybe champagne (champagne is one of the most surprisingly food-versatile wines, red or white) then go with a full bottle red... you'll find something that will carry through multiple dishes if need be."
wine,35m838,jeebidy,3,Mon May 11 21:53:16 2015 UTC,Any two or three michelin restaurant is almost certainly opening bottles for their parings.

wine,35m4z3,Algernon_Moncrieff,4,Mon May 11 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"Generally a wine that is very tannic and acidic would be good for cellaring.  Most wines, especially lower priced wines are made to be drank young.  If you are buying a Pinot Noir from Oregon, it probably isn't something you want to cellar but there are exceptions."
wine,35m4z3,joecom,1 point,Mon May 11 19:20:27 2015 UTC,Thanks.  See my response above.  So would you say you look for a wine that might be a little tannic and acidic but otherwise good?
wine,35m4z3,Twerp129,2,Mon May 11 20:21:12 2015 UTC,"Since Pinot is not particularly tannic you're looking for good acid. St. Innocent, Bethel Heights, Soter spring to mind as good options for ageable Oregon Pinot."
wine,35m4z3,megapurple,5,Mon May 11 23:28:00 2015 UTC,"The main question should be how long do you plan to cellar? There's short-term aging of 1 to 4 yrs where you allow tannins to become more integrated & the wines soften, and then long-term of 6~20+ yrs in which the wines evolve, the fruit recedes & secondary tastes & aromas bloom.   Most fine reds over $40 will benefit from short-term cellaring, but choosing which bottles can go the distance & become distinctive after a decade is a crapshoot for newer wineries with no proven track record. That's one of the reasons well-known producers from Bordeaux, the Rhone, Burgundy & the Piedmont command such high prices. You're paying for that age-ability.   As far as Oregon Pinots, i'll be honest and say that I hardly ever encounter bottles more than 5 or 6 yrs old, with the exception of a few of Tony Soter's Beacon Hills from the 1st half of the 00's that my friend collected. Those have evolved quite nicely with great earth/mineral notes & foresty aromas & fading fruit."
wine,35m4z3,IlluminatedWorld,1 point,Mon May 11 19:37:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response.  I read an article somewhere that said that Oregon Pinots should wait 7 years before drinking.  I've tried that with my wines and have had good luck with it.
wine,35m4z3,initialgold,3,Mon May 11 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"The majority of wine being sold is mature and ready to drink (all wine is ""aged"" after it's bottled, usually  at least 6 months to a year prior to being released for sale). This doesn't mean that wine can't or shouldn't be aged for longer, but it does mean that most wine won't necessarily improve with ageing. If you prefer the profiles that older wines tend to have, I would simply buy older vintages. There are plenty of affordable older wines out there, where you will more or less know what you're getting.    If you're really set on trying to age wine yourself that's fine, but it's going to be a very inexact process. Picking out wine that will actually improve from ageing, (not just in terms of preference), is difficult. Your wine may even, (usually with long term ageing), lose complexity, or other positive characteristics.   The easiest thing to do is just buy a full case of wine and each year pull a bottle out and sample it. You could also use a site like Cellartracker, assuming that the producer is well known enough that the wine is consistently tracked."
wine,35m4z3,dyuhas,2,Tue May 12 06:05:55 2015 UTC,For people answering: will it say on the bottle if its meant to be cellared or not? How else would you know?
wine,35m4z3,fursink,2,Mon May 11 21:17:16 2015 UTC,The label won't tell you if it's meant to be cellared.  Another thing nobody selling wine will tell you is that not all bottle of the same wine will age the same way.

What I'd suggest though, before you splurge on a first or second growth, is trying a couple of mid-price wines first. Ch Poujeaux 2010 for example is US$30-50 and generally a good buy (IMHO).   If you're used to Cali reds, a Bordeaux will be something quite different and I'd hate for you to buy, store, and open something on a special occasion that's just not to your taste."

It's definitely the superstar grape up at Chelan, and a lot of them will knock your socks clean off.  Bring extra socks.  -Vin du Lac Winery: makes fantastic reds.  Even their little tables wines (called ""Red Cafe"") are excellent.  -Nefarious Cellars: This is a little winery owned and run by a husband/wife pair, and they make some very fine, long aging wines.  Of particular note are the syrahs and a red blend called something like ""RX-3.""  -Karma Vineyards: The reds are so-so, but they make excellent chardonnay and rose sparklers.  -Tsillan Cellars: One of the bigger and more well-known wineries in the area, but its reputation is well-deserved.  Pretty much anything there is good.  Again, I took home some syrah, but they also have a very German-tasting gewurztraminer, as well as a rose that tastes like explosive bubble gum and tropical fruit.  -One place I would avoid is ""Hard Row to Hoe.""  It's a very touristy and popular spot with lackluster, overpriced wines.  Their bit is more about telling you a story of crossing the lake for hookers in the gold mining days and selling you branded panties.  Other suggestions: Stay in Leavenworth.  It's a little bit of a drive back and forth, but it's super fun to come back from wine tasting and do German food + beer.  The sit down German restaurants are all good, albeit super overpriced.  However, our favorite spot was the sausage and beer garden run by a butcher shop called ""Cured.""  It's definitely better than the nearby Munchen Haus.  Also, try and stop in Wenatchee and taste at Chateau Faire Le Pont.  It's an excellent winery with my absolute favorite of syrahs (Milbrandt Vineyard Free Run), as well as a host of other fantastic reds and whites, and a gorgeous, delicate pomme de glace.

Also left with a case, shipping a case for $15?? Um Yes Please!  -Oh and Vin du Lac has a 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cab Sauv that is an absolute delight, it's an 07 that stands tall.   Also if you're in Chelan and in the mood for Italian fare,  Andante is absolutely fantastic. Big Bold and Expressive wine list, with some of the best pasta's and flavors you could ask for.

wine,35jjfr,Sazerac1850,5,Mon May 11 01:05:03 2015 UTC,"Also, thanks to TABC law; its legal for your parents to give you alcohol under their supervision, in a restaurant. if they're open to that idea of you drinking while you're out to dinner, they can tell the server to pour for you so long as they remain visible.   Sec. 106.06.(b) of The Alcoholic Beverage Code Sections Referencing Minors of TABC: A person may purchase an alcoholic beverage for or give an alcoholic beverage to a minor if he is the minor's adult parent, guardian, or spouse, or an adult in whose custody the minor has been committed by a court, and he is visibly present when the minor possesses or consumes the alcoholic beverage.  Drink with food. Spit without. The more you drink, the duller your palate will become in a day (I.e. drunk)  Learn about the core varietals before getting I to the weird/nerdy stuff. That's cool if you are super psyched about Austrian Zweigelt or Sicillian Frappato; but if you don't know how a pinot noir from Napa tastes then what's the point?   Books that are my go tos:   Sales and Service for the Wine Professional by Brian K. Julyan. Windows on the World by Kevin Zraly Atlas of Wine by Hugh Johnson.  The Wine Bible by Karen MacNeil Wine Grapes by Jancis Robinson * Setting the Table by Danny Meyer**   *Relatively costly, bout $150, but it is simply amazing at breaking down the almost 1,400 vine varieties.   **More about hospitality from a great restauranteur.   But seriously, find a gig as a food runner or backwaiter in a nicer establishment like Oxheart or Hugo's. Express interest and ask if you can sit in on staff tastings. I love when kids give a shit about the industry.   Good luck!"

wine,35jjfr,heavyhandedpour,6,Mon May 11 06:04:33 2015 UTC,"Before you go crazy on the literature, get a job in a restaurant... you have to know whether or not you actually like woking in restaurants and serving people. If you want a career as a somm, expect to spend 10+ years there at least 40 hrs a week. The most useful knowledge that you'll gain will come from your experience at the restaurant.  Also, everyone has to start at the beginning. Being ambitious and having read a lot won't land you a somm job right off the bat, and it's really important that you learn basics about service. All the best somms were bus boys and bar backs once upon a time..."
wine,35jjfr,burnsbrightest,4,Mon May 11 04:10:46 2015 UTC,"While theory and tasting are important, service is the key to being a Rockstar somm. A sommelier (versus say, a certified specialist of wine) is a service position; get a gig in a restaurant or wine shop. Depending on the laws in your area, you may or may not able to pour  but you can get a feel for service and start to garner an understanding of hospitality. Service, theory, tasting, in that order, got me to level 2 cms certification."
wine,35jjfr,sr784,8,Mon May 11 02:57:24 2015 UTC,"A cover to cover read of Karen McNiel's 'The Wine Bible' is probably the logical place to start and it could very well take you 4 full years to read it! Really though - read a lot, taste when you can, but realize there is a lot of life after 21 so don't feel the need to be in a rush. If being a Somm in a restaurant is what you're really after, find entry level work at a joint nearby and learn all you can. Cheers, man."
wine,35jjfr,theultrayik,2,Mon May 11 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"910 pages, jeez! I see 'The World Atlas of Wine' is similarly popular, would that be good to read alongside 'The Wine Bible'?"
wine,35jjfr,theultrayik,2,Mon May 11 00:57:18 2015 UTC,"The read actually goes faster than you might expect.  It starts slow, as you have a lot of technical stuff to learn, and Western European wine regions are kind of a pain in the ass, but as wine regions get smaller (or you get into more familiar US territory), it picks up in pace.  I started the book with little wine knowledge, and even doing college and work full-time I completed it in about four months."

wine,35jjfr,you_did_what_to_whom,2,Mon May 11 15:12:39 2015 UTC,"I started in Austin when I was 17, got a gig in production with a winery in the Hill Country, became friends with the somm that worked there and started going to his blind tastings/events in Austin.  Honestly starting with a job in production would be easiest I think since it will provide you with opportunities to not only get your hands dirty but probably even taste a bit (at the very least taste what you're working with). I'm pretty familiar with Hill Country wineries but not too much with Houston area, I drove 45 minutes each way for my first harvest job, and an hour each way for my second, so don't be afraid to look for work a few miles away. Feel free to shoot me a PM if you have any questions :)  The first wine book I picked up was ""The Sommolier's Guide to Wine"", which I bought after I had been accepted into a Wine and Viticulture program for my bachelor's degree. Having parents that are supportive are going to be incredibly helpful (my mom or dad would usually switch off coming to tastings with me so it was legal)."
wine,35jjfr,Muppet_Mower,2,Mon May 11 04:28:20 2015 UTC,"I'm taking my certification test in June, and I would say, since you're so young, is to read as much as possible about wine regions and grape varieties. A large portion of the tests will be about this, so you can focus there.  Maybe if you can have your older sibling or friend help procure you some wine to taste (safely at home) you could start to develop the ability to distinguish and describe aromas and flavors of different types of wine. To do this, you would want to taste flights of wine in one setting, for example a Cab, Pinot, Malbec, Sangiovese, Syrah, and Zin."
wine,35jjfr,dirtysouthwine,2,Mon May 11 06:18:30 2015 UTC,Another vote for The Wine Bible (revised edition coming out this fall).  Easy to read and not pretentious.  It is the first book I recommend to friends asking the same questions as you.

Make sure to get a reservation for there, though.  I also liked going up to Chateau Montelena, if just for the historical relevance. If you want to go to a place with lots of tourists, Robert Mondavi is fun (and huge pours for the tastings), but again, touristy.  If you go through Yountville, make sure to get a snack and a coffee at Bouchon Bakery  and stare longingly at Thomas Keller's French Laundry.  And if you've got the time, try to find some delicious Lodi area wineries!  Oh and in Sonoma, Ram's Gate is tasty (get a reservation) and Cline was fun because it has lots of animals (and a cheap tasting)."

wine,35i6wk,lizzzellzzz,6,Sat May 16 12:23:38 2015 UTC,"It depends a lot on what you're looking for.  Napa has a lot to offer.  There's the ""Wine Disneyland"" run, 29 from Yountville to St. Helena.  Big names, lots of tourists.  Pricey tastings.  Everyone should do this at least once.  Hop over to the other side of the valley on the silverado trail and check out the Stag's leap district.  Less tourists and more boutique wines.  That area still typically has formal tasting rooms and pricey tastings.  If you're looking for more low key tastings, my personal recommended trip would be a drive north from Oakville on the Silverado trail.  Start with Conn Creek, or Rombauer (these are the most touristy places on this drive), then stop by Casa Nuestra, maybe Paoletti if you have a sense of humor (the wine isn't great but their wine caves are really a sight to behold), stop at Lava Vine and then end up at (my personal favorite producer) Vincent Arroyo.  After all those tastings, head to Calistoga, where you can get a nice dinner.  That's a great day in the valley and you won't break the bank or be surrounded by tour buses and none of those places could be described as ""pretentious""."

Those two places with a lunch at Solage in the middle is just about everything I love about Napa.    Another winner in that area if you have time for a tour is Storybook Mountain.  It's a little out of the way, so I probably wouldn't recommend it for a tourist, but they do an awesome by appointment tasting in a really unique location."

No shit... burger joint with Ferrari and Aston Martin in the parking lot, and the burgers where $10-ish.

We got a private lunch with their chef, which included  an in depth a tour of the winery and a 5 course meal. We even got to play with the goats and pick our food from their garden. It was amazing, but pricey. Schramsberg cave tour - We did a few cave tours. This was the best, especially if you like sparkling wine. We learned a ton on this tour. Pride Mountain - There is a grocery store in Napa that is great for picnic items.  Go there and load up, and then climb the mountain to Pride. They have a picnic area that is gorgeous. Their tasting is a lot of fun, very informative, and the cave tour is solid. They do a fun barrel tasting as well.   Much more to add, but those were our highlights."

wine,35i6wk,PayMeNoAttention,2,Sun May 10 22:29:11 2015 UTC,"The wine at Pride was good, but we were more impressed with the atmosphere and the cool facts we learned. Sorry, I'm a nerd. For instance, the winery sits on the Napa / Sonoma County line, so they have to keep the grapes separated for tax purposes. Also, they have a vineyard that sits on the apex of the mountain, and you can taste the difference of the morning sun wine vs the evening sun wine from the same grape. Cool stuff."
wine,35i6wk,t-who,3,Mon May 11 00:14:05 2015 UTC,"The wine is fine, it just seems like it is the most common suggestion on spring mountain because if the view and the grounds. There are a lot of better options for views and wine on spring mountain, but that's just my opinion.  If you are a nerd in the normal sense, palmaz is worth looking at. It is owned by an ex medical engineer who took a very over the top technical approach to the facility. The main fermentation room reminded me of the command center at JPL. The wine is good too, but not amazing."

wine,35i6wk,k_ing_lucas,1 point,Mon May 11 15:30:10 2015 UTC,"Spring Mountain AVA.  Plenty of wineries (and one distillery!) scattered on throughout the mountain.  Personal favorite is Paloma Vineyard.  The owner, Barbara, has to be in her early 70's.  She welcomes you into her home that looks over the entire valley.  The vineyard itself is only 16 acres, 15 of which are merlot grapes.  The other is cab.  The operation itself is only 3 people.  Barbara, her son (the wine maker), and the vineyard supervisor.    My girlfriend and I had no idea what to expect.  We drive up to a typical ranch-style house and we see only the front door.  We walk to the front door and out comes Barbara.  She escorts us to her balcony and just talks with us about everything for 30 minutes.  No wine has been introduced.  Finally she brings out the wines, which are all merlots except for an '06 Syrah.  They used to grow Syrah, but a bug came in and wiped all of the plants out.  Tasting fee: waived with a single bottle purchase.  We got a merlot for about $35.  Excellent price and an excellent experience.  No pressure to buy, no pressure to join a wine club which is something I've never experienced again in Napa."
wine,35i6wk,GiovanniSierra,1 point,Mon May 11 15:30:22 2015 UTC,"Hi OP a bit late, but a Napa native here. Some nice lowkey area to go eat are: Big D's burgers, Gott's, Nations- those are all like burger joints in close proximity. Pizzeria Tra Vigne is a nice place to go if you like traditional kiln pizza with a nice setting in St.Helena. A good small Italian place that nobody would know about unless you're a local is clemente's Italian take out, which is by far the best small business Italian place. It's inside of a liquor store next to nations which further explains why nobody knows about it, but by far the best Italian food. All of these places are relatively cheap with everything costing less than 20$(since Napa can be pricey) If you're looking down the winery route you can't go wrong with Robert Mondavi or Sterling Winery for that iconic basket thingy ride over the vines. For scenic areas for locals you can go hiking up skyline park, which would take about two hours to get to the top, but a very scenic view(if you want pictures I can send some), or go driving up to lake Hennessy, you can also go driving past Silverado trail and past Silverado middle school to an area that locals know as ""the view"" for a reason. A very short hike is up Westwood hills that would take about 30 minutes to get to the top with a semi-scenic view. There is also Alston park which is a nice place to walk around and explore, you might even see people on horses and definitely a lot of dog walkers.I tried to focus on small areas only locals really know about, if you would like more info let me know."

You have to make an appointment, but they're really attentive and friendly.  Vincent Arroyo: I think the tasting is free?  You have to make an appointment, but they'll give you a small tour.  They also let us do a barrel tasting.  If you bring some food, they're also happy to let you picnic outside with a bottle of wine.  Whetstone: Really old, cool stone building.  Also really good Pinot. :)  Odette: Bought not that long ago by the people that own Plumpjack and Cade.  Last time I was there, they were just starting to produce their own wine, so the tasting was filled out with wines from the other properties.  It's small and relaxing.  Mumm: A bit touristy, but if you like sparkling wine, this is a great place to sit outside and relax.  James Cole: Small tasting room, good atmosphere.  I don't remember a lot about this place, other than the singer from Lifehouse was there and we piggy-backed on his tour. :)  Stag's Leap: One of the Napa winners of the Judgement of Paris.  Used to have a membership here, but they just built a brand new, ultra modern tasting room, and I feel like they lost a lot of character as a result.  I still love their Cabs, though.  Honorable mention: Black Stallion: First place I ever went in Napa. We got a membership because the employees were incredibly nice and generous with the pours.  Their wines probably aren't the best (though I do really like their Zins), but they're relatively affordable."

Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot are used in the blends however. Even though you are technically allowed Carmenere and Malbec for example. For the whites, they tend to go for Sauvignon and Semillon, except Sauternes that is a bit special.   Left bank is Cabernet dominant. Right bank is Merlot dominant.  St Emilion is awesome. St Julien is awesome. St Estephe is awesome. (But that's just me being completely subjective here.)   Sooo.. yeah. That's that. It isn't a lot, but then again in 2 hours you probably won't get much more. Enjoy your trip."
wine,35hpjg,Martinsimonnet,4,Sun May 10 14:21:45 2015 UTC,"Lots of red grapes allowed in their red wines   Another way to say this is to say Bordeaux is all about blending, whether white, red or pink.   There are examples of 100% varietal wines, but they are fairly rare.   they tend to go for Sauvignon and Semillon, except Sauternes   Sauternes is Sauvignon and Semillon as well, just affected by botritys.   Left bank is Cabernet dominant.   This is also not entirely true. What is true is that most of the Cabernet that is grown in BDX is grown on the left bank. BDX as a whole is actually merlot-dominant."
wine,35hpjg,jaded76,2,Sun May 10 14:39:11 2015 UTC,What? No.  Left bank wines definitely traditionally have a Cab Sauv majority in their blind and right bank wines traditionally are merlot dominant. I would say that is true for 9/10 wines. That is reflected also by the quantity grown in the respective regions.
wine,35hpjg,shiversaint,1 point,Sun May 10 23:10:32 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that the Cab-based wines do come from the left bank, and from the gravel-based soils there. However, the left bank is not entirely gravel, so it's not entirely covered in Cabernet Sauvignon. There are plenty of left-bank producers that grow and use a majority of merlot in their blends. I have several in my portfolio now.  BUT, Bordeaux as a whole is Merlot-dominant. It is without a doubt the most planted red grape in the region, left, right and middle."
wine,35hpjg,jaded76,1 point,Mon May 11 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"That's really because of the vast quantity of base quality wine that the french and belgians glug on a daily basis as it's earlier ripening and easier to work with. It isn't really representative of commune typicity when we look at serious bordeaux, and when discussing BDX plainly for a newb, anomalies aren't helpful IMO."
wine,35hpjg,shiversaint,1 point,Mon May 11 00:13:09 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but as far as commune typicity if that is the vast quantity of wine produced in the region, than to me that is typical.   IMO, the famous chateaux of the Medoc/Graves/Grand Cru Classé are outliers, as they are definitely the exception rather than the rule. I don't know many people who only consume these types of wines on a daily or regular basis with their own money.  Also, I'm personally tired of correcting somms, buyers, reps, and consumers with their overly-reductionist view of Bordeaux of just saying, ""oh it's from St Estephe so it's Cab right"". That to me is like saying only Cab grows in Napa, which is also clearly not correct. Maybe I'm just tired of lazy buyers..."

Many laughs were had.  But yeah I see your point as well - I guess I am looking at this from a traditional stand point, and really what you would want to actually go to BDX for. Do people go down there to buy 7 euro plonk that's just overoaked merlot that the vigneron pisses on for irrigation? I'd say visits are more about the apogee of BDX and that's where this kind of thing comes in.  (if you didn't guess, I'd happily reduce the BDX output by 60% to normalise quality and price)"

wine,35hpjg,Martinsimonnet,3,Sun May 10 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"Bordeaux is bisected by the Gironde. The left [of the river] bank consists of the traditionally grander houses, within the Pauillac, St. Estephe, St. Julien, Margaux and (technically) Graves (Pessac Leognan if you want to get specific) communes. These are traditionally Cab Sauv heavy wines in a typically 3 grape blend of CS, Merlot and Cabernet Franc in that order. Occasionally you may get Petit Verdot in 5-10% tops amounts. Malbec and Camenere are allowed but rare.  The left bank wines are encompassed by the 1855 classification, which denotes 5 levels of quality, or ""growths"". It's generally horseshit nowadays, First Growths are the only ones that seem to consistently keep the reputation throughout every vintage (although not always). But they are priced accordingly. These wines will have ""Grand Cru Classé"" on the label, first growths having ""Premier Grand Cru Classé"" (sometimes). It's worth reading the article on wikipedia about the 1855 classification. But generally aim for GCC wines and you'll be doing ok.  Right bank wines come from two major (I use that word tentatively as the latter is tiny) communes called St. Emilion and Pomerol. There are loads of satellite communes mind you but these are the major ones and have some very prestigious wines. Neither fall into the original 1855 but St. Emilion has its own (fucked) classification - these are also denoted GCC. They can also be denoted GC but don't have many quality restrictions like the GCCs do. All right bank wines tend to be Merlot dominated.  There are also dry whites which are somehow a minority (as they can truly be world class) but these tend to be Sauvignon Blanc and Semillion blends, the best being from Graves and most specifically Pessac Leognan.  Sauternes are noble rot based sweet wines that use similar grapes to the dry whites and are a whole class of their own.  Particular vintages to look out for in reds (my faves) are 58,59, 61, 62, 66, 70, 71, 78, 82, 85, 89, 90, 94 (pomerol only) 95, 96, 00 (low end only) 01, 04 (lower end only will be drinking). Any others are either shit or quite closed at the moment. Of course this is very general and there are exceptions everywhere.  My advice if you have to pick one Chateau: Domaine de Chevalier. Excellent dry whites (nearly top of the class) and great value reds. 2007 and 2011 dry whites are excellent across the board. 85 also lovely in both colours. 2002 red is a cheeky bargain that is so lovely to drink right now.  If you have the opportunity to drink some first growth wine I would go for Haut Brion. 1985 again is a stunner in red and white. 1988 red is a good exercise in old school bordeaux too, nice and austere and will put some hair on your chest. 1989 will bankrupt you.  If you want to try some garagiste freaky new world style reds, try Le Dome in St. Emilion. Not at all representative but it's a classic ""parkerised"" wine and possibly one of the first of its kind in BDX, starting in 1996 (which is a shit example incidentally).  Anyway now I'm getting specific and digressing. Hope that helps - have fun! St. Emilion is a gorgeous town by the way, most peoples favourite for good reason. Fronsac is my shout for the best value satellite commune that isn't too famous but makes lovely wines."

wine,35f68m,CondorKhan,6,Sat May 9 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"Jura, how much do I love you?  Here’s an unusual and interesting wine, 2007 Philippe Bornard Savagnin Côtes du Jura Les Chassagnes Ouillé .   This is, as far as I know, a “natural” wine made with native yeasts and with no sulfur. Despite its age, there’s nothing funky or off about it. It tastes as it should.  I’ve previously reviewed Cotes du Jura Savagnin in here. This one offers a nice contrast because of its age.   Savagnin is the signature grape of the Jura, and the grape of Vin Jaune, which is made much in the same way as Fino Sherry, fermented under a layer of yeast crud called “flor” which protects the wine in the barre for a number of years. It is also made into fresher, lighter styles. Savagnin is the same grape as Traminer, which is the progenitor of the aromatic Gewurztraminer.   Savagnin was famously one of the targets of Robert Parker’s famous “Anti-flavor wine elite” rant. I really can’t see why, because this is very tasty and distinctive. Nothing bloody wrong with it. I wonder if he’s even tried it.  This one shows its age as it pours deep amber color. Aroma is of peaches and orange. On the palate, peach, sweet apple, butterscotch and blood orange, along with notes of almonds. The finish is massively acidic, tooth peeling even, with a subtle salty tang. I’ve said it many times: if you like Gueuze or Fino Sherry, you’ll love this stuff. It’s generally in the same flavor ballpark. I imagine that if Cantillon made an orange lambic, it would taste pretty much like this.   Again, it’s not weird or challenging. If you’ve already acquired the taste for wine, there’s nothing strange about this. There’s no further taste to acquire. The acidity and strong fruit keeps it from going into weird oxidized land.   As far as food pairing, this was absolutely brilliant with flounder meuniere with asparagus. I also bought a chunk of Comte, thinking that it would be a natural pairing, but it was a bit more challenging… take a sip of wine and a bite of Comte and it tastes great, but the next sip of wine tastes like water until you clean your palate with some bread.  In any case, I love this stuff."

wine,35gg60,Twerp129,3,Sun May 10 03:06:59 2015 UTC,"If we're honest, dry red wine is really the best option if you want to drink ""healthy."" However, plenty of dry wines have 1-10 grams of sugar or more.  Sweet wines can have 25 to over 100 grams of sugar per liter.  Healthy drinking is about moderating the intake."

wine,35gg60,GahMatar,2,Tue May 12 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"If you want to start drinking wine for health reasons instead of other sweet alcoholic beverages, I'd suggest going for German Riesling before fortified wines.  German Rieslings that say Kabinett, Spätlese, or Auslese on the label (WITHOUT the words Trocken or Halbtrocken) will have enough residual sugar for your taste but are only in the 8.5-10% alcohol by volume range so you can drink a lot of it.  Fortified wines will be closer to 18-20% ABV and are nice as an aperitif or digestif but not so pleasant for most people to drink over the course of a meal or an evening. They will also be the most caloric because they have both high amounts of sugar AND added alcohol (hence ""fortified"")."

So he wrote a ""textbook"" for students that were interested but couldn't get into the class, but it's a kindle book instead of a textbook-priced-POS. His whole philosophy is that you can become a wine lover at any price point and you don't have to be a certified expert to really learn how to enjoy wines. You can learn to describe wines, but only by drinking them, so get to drinking them already. Seriously. You can read the intro on the amazon.com page for the book.

The guy that wrote it does run a blog that he occasionally updates, and he does respond to emails (at least he responded to mine). here's a link.  Texas wine is frustrating, but I've found it to be worth exploring. Some of it is great, but it can be hard to even find wine by Texas winemakers that's actually made from Texas grapes. A lot of the stuff on the shelves is shit because it's made from grapes or juice brought in, often frozen, from California or wherever. It's hard growing grapes in Texas, so even winemakers who set out to only make Texas wine find themselves having to bring in grapes during bad years. The pickings on the shelves now (2013 vintage) are very thin, due to a freeze that killed off a lot of grapes.  You have to be careful. Some of the stuff from Becker and Llano is pretty great, but it's subsidized with plonk made with imported juice - and it all has the same brand stamped on it. Just make sure that when you're buying it says ""Texas,"" or the name of the Appalachian, on the bottle before giving it a shot. Don't fall for shit like ""TEXAS STYLE WINE"" from guys like Comal Creek, they really try to trick you into thinking it's actually Texas wine with little slogans like that.   Duchman, McPherson, William Chris, Brennan, Kiepersol, Pheasant Ridge, and Pedernales are all worth considering. Again, just make sure you're actually buying something from Texas. And as a general rule keep away from traditional varietals like Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay, they're hard as shit to grow in Texas and usually (not always, but usually) end up bad. Try some Tempranillo, Syrah, or Viognier."

There are plenty of books out there, in fact there is a recent feed that lists a few great ones, but the best place to start is just to start tasting wines. If you can't find a shop near you that hosts tastings I would recommend simply buying a few bottles and tasting them together to compare and contrast the differences. Perhaps a California Cabernet, a French Bordeaux, and Maybe a California Pinot Noir and a French Pinot Noir (Red Burgundy). Just to see how the styles differ across different regions. I also wouldn't go for the cheapest bottles. If you don't have a shop that has knowledgeable staff that can recommend bottles that have varietaly correct typicity, then I would buy bottles in the upper teens to high twenties as you will get a better representation of the wines in that range.   Finally, pay attention to what you're drinking. So many people drink wine without thinking about what they do and don't like about it. You can learn as much, if not more, from a bottle you don't like than a bottle you do!"

Using the four wines types you listed, would you compare them all in one sitting, or do them in pairs?   When you say don't get a cheap wine, what qualifies as cheap? $5-10, $12-20?"
wine,35eozv,Socrates5150,3,Sat May 9 18:43:05 2015 UTC,"I would compare the Cali Cab and Bordeaux in one sitting and the Pinot Noirs in a separate sitting.  $5-$10 is cheap. You can definitely find good wines in the $10-$20 range, but you will find more consistent quality in the $17-$30 range. Also, you may find a delicious bottle of Bordeaux for $12 but chances are that it won't be as typical of what Bordeaux wines taste like as a bottle at, say $25. If that feels expensive to you (and it is as you're looking at a $40-$120 investment for four bottles and you may not even like them all) then your best bet is to hold out a bit until you move and go to as many tastings as you can to get a sense of what you like."

The first provides so much information to novices regarding smelling and tasting wine; she describes wines herself, informs the reader of the typicality of different varieties, offers vocabulary words of aroma and taste, but at the same doesn't force opinions on the reader (you shouldn't be trying to smell or taste anything). The second book gives the reader a tour of nearly all the world's wine regions, providing information on their grape varieties, soil, climate, wineries, practices, etc., as well as general information regarding grapegrowing and winemaking, presented in a manner suitable for non-professionals.   Wine for Dummies is also pretty good. Get the version that includes all the major wine regions of the world in one volume.   As far as building a sensory foundation goes, smell anything and everything you can and really try to ""memorize"" that smell and put it in your vocabulary bank. If really you want some intense practice, get a whole bunch of ingredients, the ""notes"" that you might find in wines like green bell peppers, strawberries, papaya, vanilla, etc. and put them into glasses of ""neutral"" base wines (perhaps unoaked pinot noir or chardonnay), so that you can get a feel for these aromas in the context of wines. That way, you'll be better equipped to identify them later on."

So confused as to what the fruit is, but this is incredibly flavorful. More honeysuckle. White peach? But the reddish part, around the pit.   Not quite peak, but pretty amazing. Really geeky. Lingers forever.   Paired this with a carrot ginger curry and it was amazing. Roasted duck, also perfect pairing. Then a curry with daikon and shrimp. Also great. My first experience with Musar, and I'm glad I have another one still at home!   Stolen from Decanter mag:    The Château Musar white is a blend of 60 per cent barrel-fermented Oibaideh (Serge once thought this a progenitor of Chardonnay, but now considers it a progenitor of Chasselas) grown in Ain Arab, and 40 per cent barrel-fermented Merwah (considered by Serge a progenitor of Sémillon) grown, ungrafted, at Baquaâta."

I read that white Riojas were all produced like this one but the people worldview preferred whites like Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay so Spanish winemakers changed their production to satisfy the international market. Viña Tondonia is the only one who stuck to the old style and their wines are incredible, particularly their whites. They age them until they deem them drinkable and then release them when they're ready to drink, although I believe most can be aged an additional ten or so years.

It was still nice, definitely an 87-88 point wine, that paired well with pasta and meatballs in marinara sauce. Good wine, just not mind blowing. Would still recommend!"
wine,35a09o,franzinator,9,Fri May 8 10:42:05 2015 UTC,I dont know and never heard this producer... and reading your notes i think you got a lowlow profile Barolo. How much have you paid it ? btw 2009 is a too much young. Generally for medium good vintages as 2009 it's better to wait at least 8/9 years imo.
wine,35a09o,franzinator,2,Fri May 8 11:48:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I imagined it wasn't the greatest Barolo haha, which is why I am going easy on it. I also know that 2009 is a bit young, but I wanted to know if I liked Nebbiolo, and that's all my local wine store had in stock.  I didn't pay much for it, around 20 euros I believe. So not entirely surprised."
wine,35a09o,Muppet_Mower,11,Fri May 8 12:05:24 2015 UTC,"ok. 20 € for a barolo you got the superlowlow range ... probably isn't a producer but just a bottler. for the nebiolo you should try maybe the younger and easier (and cheapier) Langhe doc, same grape but usually ready to drink. Comes in mind Vietti for example, you should get at the sampe price but much a better wine."

wine,35adox,Steillage,5,Fri May 8 13:23:49 2015 UTC,"He's right that he at least has the balls to give 100 points and put himself on the spot.  To declare perfection, even in a moment of a wine's life, requires some huge nuts.  I have never tasted a 100 point wine, and probably never will.  They tend to be so extracted that I have no use for them at table, and I'd rather buy 6779 cocktails with the same intensity for the same tariff.  Now, I will say that I respect Parker's palate as being 100% accurate for what he loves.  He's a tool.  If his palate matches yours, you will never go wrong reading and buying vis a vis the Advocate.  I've heard tons of stories of Parker's photo-memory-palate--he really is a world class taster.  But because I disagree with what RP believes a quality wine is, I don't use the Advocate or submit my wines.  It would be like submitting a symphonic recording to Rolling Stone.  Wrong genre.   But blaming Parker for over-wrought wines is like blaming Disney for retarded Dalmatians.  Popularity has unintended consequences.  Robert Parker is an American Wine Hero, regardless of how his palate matches with yours.  No one besides Robert Mondavi has encouraged more Americans to pick up a glass of fine wine."

So rating barrel samples as ""100 points"" is a bit irresponsible."

wine,35adox,mistersippycups,5,Fri May 8 20:21:32 2015 UTC,I know what an average is. What is an example of a rating system where 50 is considered average? I can't think of one. That was my point.
wine,35adox,Muppet_Mower,3,Fri May 8 20:26:43 2015 UTC,Then it is not really a very good rating system is it?   At-lest not an unbiased one.   Or the system is really a 30 point rating system that just happens to start at the number 70 and ends at 100. Which would give you an average score of 85.

wine,35adox,gimpwiz,1 point,Sat May 9 10:26:28 2015 UTC,"You're totally right. I don't have sources on this but I have seen a few documentaries (i.e., Mondovino) in which they demonstrate how over the last few years, ratings have gone up considerably.  There are a couple potential reasons for that. I've heard many people condemn critics for only giving great ratings to full bodied wines with lots of rage, oak, and heft. There seems to be a correlation between the increase of high scores and that style of wine.  It could be, instead, that the style is more naturally occurring due to climate change. Champagne has had a hard time keeping the alcohol down in recent vintages, and in even hotter areas 14-15% isn't uncommon anymore.  Or... is it a combination of all of these things?   I personally believe that it is. It's no secret that the Bordelais don't price their wines until Robert Parket et al. have rated the vintage. Accidentally or not, the well known producers are totally in bed with many of the best known critics.  And why not? It sells wine. Having worked in a great wine shop for years, there are many occasions when people are willing to pay top dollar for the best wines--so long as they were rated 95+."
wine,35adox,ourmodelcitizen,1 point,Fri May 8 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"It's more than that.  Think about how much terrible wine you'd have to drink in order to accurately distinguish a 24 point wine from a 31 point wine for rating purposes.  The Advocate would have to add a staff position for this!    In actuality, the scale has effectively been set to 20 points, 80 - 100.  And I have to agree with OP here.  When considering the complexities and nuances of wine, it's almost ironic that the rating system is one-dimensional."
wine,35adox,Averagejoeqpublic,0,Fri May 8 20:52:16 2015 UTC,"Isn't that because a wine that bad would not be sold? It is, however, perfectly possible to make a wine that is just piss-poor, and there needs to be some room in the scale to rate them."

This dude's ""emotional"" state on any given day can do serious damage to - or give credit to - wineries that don't deserve it.  I don't want to go into this topic too much, because I've expressed my opinion against the 100 point system many times before, but comparing wine to a piece of art is not doing you any favors in arguing for the scoring system.  How often have you heard of people looking at a Picasso or Rembrandt or Monet and saying ""that's a 96pt painting ya got there"". It would seem completely absurd. But for some reason it's acceptable and downright the norm for the wine industry...  I'll never be able to wrap my head around that one."

I think 100s should be reserved for the best of a certain style or ""perfection"" of a style. I find it hard to believe that there can be multiple bottles year in and year out that are the best or perfect.  I think numerical ratings are pretty stupid in every industry I've really been exposed to them in: wine, restaurants, movies, videogames, etc. I'm definitely willing to read a reviewers write-up and thoughts about something, and over time I will find people who think about these mediums in the same way I do and I'll start to give them more credence.  Reducing any of these things to a number(whether it is 100 point scale, three or four stars, or 1-10) is what I find irresponsible."

The 50-100 scale is a 50 point bucket rating system though in reality it is 75-100, 25 buckets, for non-flawed wines. If it were A-F (5 points) would you only give an A to the greatest essay ever written? Of course not. If the scale was 10-1 would you never give a 10? What if you had 20 buckets, allowing for 9.5 ratings? Still object to a ""perfect"" 10?  So, here we've effectively got 25-1 which is only five buckets more than you get on 10-1 if you allow for 0.5 ratings. Why is it bad to have a bell curve distribution with a blip in the 25th bucket because we're fallible humans and perhaps the scale should have gone to 32 buckets, 75-107, or some other arbitrary number? That is, whatever number you end with is going to have a concentration of wines there.  I think 100 should be defined as really, really great and NOT best. Then, a few more people would have a little less to argue about."
wine,35adox,flitcroft,-1,Fri May 8 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"Perfection is literally unattainable, whether it's in wine or movies or  art. Nothing in reality is a perfect 100.

I agree that long term perfection is not sustainable nor possible  but I fully believe that things can be perfect at one point even for just a moment. So if your tasting a wine and you happen to taste the bottle at a perfect moment than there is nothing wrong with awarding a perfect score."

And he knows exactly what he's doing when he gives that perfect score. He's a game changer for wineries and their products, and what does that mean? Do they continue to make wine to suit his taste so their production and sales can keep up? Or do they keep doing things their own way?  Probably not the latter."

This is a bit ""irresponsible"", because readers will not take it that way, instead they will likely suppose that a perfect wine is perfect anywhere and anytime (if not faulted or damaged)."
wine,35adox,Ausonius89,2,Sat May 9 01:02:41 2015 UTC,"Sure, a 50 pt or 30 pt scale might make more logical sense, but remember that Parker began writing for Americans.  Culturally, a 100 pt scale is most familiar to us.  Compare to the French/British 20 pt scale for rating wine (which reflects France's 20 pt grading system in their educational system).  That said, I do find it galling that many of today's consumers think that a wine rated under 90 pts by Parker or anyone else is not worth drinking.  Parker himself writes: ""80-89 is equivalent to a B in school and such a wine, particularly in the 85-89 range, is very, very good; many of the wines that fall into this range often are great values as well. I have many of these wines in my personal collection.""  These are wines for every day drinking and for immediate pleasure!"

They feel they don't know enough about wine so they will go with whatever an ""expert"" tells them.  Parker's system was important when it began but its influence has reined far too long. As you say, many people think a wine under 90 pts isn't worth drinking. To me, this is one of the indicators that the system has been rendered irrelevant, and current times mean we have to start looking at and tasting wine differently.  Parker isn't unimportant. I just think he needs to move over."

And the best way to get your name out there is to give high marks, so that producers and wine shops can put little stickers and tags with big numbers on them to let the public know how good the wine is.    It's basically a conflict of interest.  High marks = more exposure = more money = keep giving higher marks.  That's why we're at the point where anything below 90 points is not worth it.

I was stating that there shouldn't even be a point system, but a open dialogue about wines (accurate descriptors: acid, body, tannin, fruitiness, and whether the taster liked it or not).    The buyer argued that Parker and Spectator are his sales points, rather than the actual merit of the wine.  Basically, he can move 5 cases of Napa cab rated 93 by Parker or Spectator faster than he could 5 cases of Napa cab that hasn't been rated, but he's very impressed with the product.  He went so far to say that if you're going to keep a point system, that there should never be any 100 point wines, because wine is subjective.  He instead suggested a 97/100 system in which the highest rated wine could only be a 97- because everyone's pallet is different.

Let me know if y'all think it'd be better to just publish tasting notes right here. Lord knows we need 'em.  It's been far too long since I last posted to this subreddit. I could blame it on the back-to-back wine tours my fiancée and I took last month. I could blame it on some personal issues. Instead I'll blame it on my desire to drink wine outweighing my desire to write about it.  On to the bottle. The label is actually kind of confusing, as Bloomer Creek produced two Vin d'été wines in 2011. If I remember it right, one is a varietal Cabernet Franc; this one is 80 percent Cab Franc and 20 percent Gamay Noir, all of which was grown in estate vineyards.  Both wines are good. This wine is better. It's light and refreshing, with just enough acidity to leave you wanting more with each sip. Raspberries burst out of the nose and on the palate, and there's just a slight hint of the vegetal characteristics often found in Cab Franc.  But the real reason I'm writing about this is to extol the virtues of Bloomer Creek's owner, vineyard manager, and winemaker, Kim Engle. Plenty has been written about him -- Google ""Finger Lakes wine"" and you're likely to find many stories mentioning Bloomer Creek -- yet I want to focus on his mastery of the region's wild vintage variations.  Some producers in the Finger Lakes don't seem to realize they're in a cold climate. They try to force their wines into a specific mold; when it doesn't work out, they blame the weather or use far, far too much oak to mask any faults in their wines. It's a sad practice that has probably helped facilitate the myth that the region can't produce nice red wine.  Engle doesn't do that. He takes what the vintage gives him and he works with it instead of fighting against it. This wine isn't as powerful, tannic, or complex as the varietal Cab Franc he made in 2010. The horrible 2011 growing conditions made sure that couldn't happen.  So what did he make? A light, refreshing wine that's true to the Finger Lakes. Engle didn't hide the faults with new oak, and he doesn't have to make excuses for attempting to force the grapes into a wine they obviously didn't want to become. He respects each vintage's novelty.  Some other producers realize this as well, and they don't try to force a specific style every year. I hope more wineries start to do the same."

There's a lot of people who buy wine because the wine maker has a reputation, and there name carries value for the consumer. And I don't spend a lot of time trying to break people's illusions, but my experience is that when your average consumer finds out that the winemaker no longer has anything to do with the wine with their name on it, (and most of the time now owned by a big corp.) they feel at least a little jipped or misled. They are a lot happier to be in the know and feel like more educated consumers, whether or not they continue to buy the brand. Which imo is awesome."

wine,354ol3,Iamfarmer,3,Thu May 7 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"Different measurements for essentially the same thing, is the way I understand it. pH is the scale of acidic/basic, from 0 to 14, with things like Coca-Cola at 1, water is 'neutral' at 7, and I can't think of an example for something alkaline right now... Essentially this scale is the measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. There's a formula to work out this concentration from the pH number, but it involves logarithms and I'm on my phone typing this... This measurement is mainly used to hone in the microbial stability of a wine. TA is a measurement of titratable (or total) acidity, expressed in grams per liter.  Both are measurements of acidity expressed in different ways - they are related but measured differently.  I'm still learning about this (training to be a winemaker), so I may have gotten some of this wrong."
wine,354ol3,dotheneurotic,3,Thu May 7 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"Fun fact, coke has a pH of 2.52.  A pH of 1 is battery acid and the like.  A common alkaline substance is drain cleaner (around pH 14) or baking soda (pH 9.5)."
wine,354ol3,Ganzer6,1 point,Thu May 7 11:33:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the correction!
wine,354ol3,dotheneurotic,2,Thu May 7 11:57:50 2015 UTC,"pH is a measure of the free protons (H+ ions) found in wine, unbound to any acids, such as tartaric acid. It serves as the ""backdrop"" for many physical, chemical, and microbial reactions in wine, which are either directly or indirectly influenced by the proton concentration. Color, oxidation, flavor, and much more are all affected by pH.  Total acidity is the sum of all acids (with bound protons) and their neutralized salts (typically with potassium K or sodium Na) found in wine. Total acidity, however, is actually a useless term and measurement, providing no useful information with regards to wine flavor, stability, etc.   What is significantly more important is titratable acidity, which is just the first portion of the definition of total acidity, simply the acids with bound protons. Titratable acidity is measured by reacting (neutralizing) with a strong base (typically NaOH), the amount of which used indicates how much acid is present in a wine. Whereas pH is the backdrop for a variety of things, titratable acidity is the actual source of perceived sourness or tartness. It is these acids with bound protons that are sensed by our palates.   It's worth noting that many, many people, esteemed winemakers included, will say total acidity when they actually mean titratable acidity. Hardly anyone in the industry actually measures those neutralized salts yet call their measurement ""total acidity."""

wine,354ol3,hazzyk,3,Fri May 8 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"As a winemaker, I find the best way to think of it is that pH is the number of free hydrogen ions native in the wine, while TA us how readily you will gain more hydrogen ions when you expose it to a more basic environment (like your mouth!!).  Of course the ramifications of pH are huge, with free H+ ions being utterly fundamental in all sorts of chemical and biological processes but i think the above analogy gives you some idea of how it plays against TA, and why TA is a better indication of the taste of acid. To give a quick example, a wine with high pH and high TA (the worst) will have few free hydrogen ions, with most of them bound up (probably mostly to potassium), but many will be released when the equilibrium is changed, and the wine is exposed to a higher-pH environment, such as your palate.   One criticism of TA, for me, is that we use it to simulate the ""taste"" of acid, and yet we look at how many H ions disassociate in a titration to pH 8.2 (from memory), while our palate is pH 6-7. Why not try and simulate palate pH and see how many H ions disassociate at this pH? Alas, I am but a humble winemaker, but maybe a chemist can clarify this."

You'd be hard pressed to find much difference between all of the producers making 95+ point wines out of To Kalon. Even the winemakers there come harvest time scratch their heads and go, ""Is it time to pick yet? Nah a couple more days."" And then they all look at each other as if one of them knows something the other doesn't. Or some make their picks based off of available tank space, but at the end of the day it doesn't even really matter because the fruit and place it came from is so special.   At the very best, wine makers are caretakers, of the land and the fruit, and if all goes well, they don't' screw up a years+ worth of work.  Can you tell me the name of the winemaker for DRC? How about the winemakers out of To Kalon? Maybe people know Hobbs and T.Brown, but who else? Who are the winemakers making wine from Eisele, Dr. Crane, Martha's vineyard, Shafer's hillside vineyard?"

It's been cellared properly since I've had it, and I figured it was time to open it before it started to go downhill.   Wow! What a beautiful bottle! I decanted and drank after about an hour. It opened up nicely and completely. And it didn't change much over the hour and half we took to finish the bottle. And, in a good way, not quite what I expected. Soft and developed tannins, and pretty mellow red fruit. Hints of smoke and peat. But no bitter flavors like pencil lead. In fact, the most enjoyable part of this bottle seemed to be that it wasn't overwhelming in any way. It was just a subtle example of a perfectly crafted California Cabernet.

I prefer to think not in terms of absolute price but relative price. There's no such thing as decent grand cru burgundy or high-end napa cabs much under 100$.  So while a ""400$"" Chambertin is a normal price, it's excessive for a Corton and it's downright excessive for a village cru. So if you could get a Mortet Chambertin for 400$, you're getting ""good value"" but a Leroy Volnay for 200$? Well, you're paying that much because it's a Leroy."

wine,34y3nf,CondorKhan,5,Wed May 6 01:07:42 2015 UTC,"In my experience, quality increases somewhat linearly with price right until the $70 mark or so. After that, hype, rarity and prestige are the main drivers in price. And Screagle has a lot of hype, rarity and prestige.  Of course, that number varies a lot, especially according to region. In Burgundy, you're just about starting to get consistently decent wine at $70.   In Rioja, $70 gets you the best of the best.  But even within the same region the name carries a lot of weight. For instance, Chateau D'Yquem might be 5x to 10x as expensive as Chateau Climens, but it's certainly not 5x to 10x times better."
wine,34y3nf,Williamfoster63,3,Tue May 5 18:19:53 2015 UTC,"For instance, Chateau D'Yquem might be 5x to 10x as expensive as Chateau Climens, but it's certainly not 5x to 10x times better.   At that point it becomes a matter of how much you're willing to spend for that little bit extra quality. Is something 2x better than Climens worth a 10x higher price tag? In my experience, it depends. If it's something I may not get again, or for some reason a unique experience, it may warrant the extra high price because at that point, like you said, it's not the quality of the wine driving the price - it's the cachet and the circumstance."
wine,34y3nf,FlemishPrimitive,5,Tue May 5 19:12:49 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of split on that...  The day I actually splurged on Chateau D'Yquem it was kind of underwhelming, because I was expecting a religious experience but it was merely a really good wine.

wine,34y3nf,midgetlotterywinner,1 point,Tue May 5 20:06:03 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly! Many down to earth wine-lovers I know (in Europe) even say you cannot get more intrinsic quality above the 50 euro mark (= 56 $). And by intrinsic quality I mean that you could taste the difference in a blind test.  If you watch the following video (9:56 min) you will see that even the top wine critics cannot tell the difference between a € 1.500 Chateau Pétrus and a € 14.90 (yes, a hundred times cheaper) bottle of Chateau Reignac. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1leRdKluE7I  This is good news for all not-so-rich wine-lovers, because it's indeed just hype, rarity and prestige..."
wine,34y3nf,ChalkyTannins,2,Wed May 6 13:22:21 2015 UTC,"I think what a lot of people struggle with is identifying the line where you start paying for the name instead of the wine, because at a certain point, there's only so much care you can put into a wine.    Screaming Eagle doesn't have some magical process that no one knows about that allows them to produce a better quality wine than other high end Napa producers. They don't have a particularly notable location in Oakville, and there are over 50 other producers making wine from grapes grown there.  They do a great job, but at the end of the day you're paying a lot for the name."
wine,34y3nf,ChalkyTannins,6,Tue May 5 19:37:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on ""paying a lot for the name"".  One of my favorites (before the winery owners closed shop) was Showket, who sourced their fruit from a vineyard adjacent to Screaming Eagle's vines and had the same winemaker as SE (Heidi Barrett).  But they didn't have the ""mystique"" and were selling bottles around the $60-$75 price range.  Their Cabs were basically a budget Screaming Eagle (particularly the 2003).  I have a few bottles still in storage.  You're right...you're paying a lot for the name and for the label.  But nowadays you can get any number of Napa cabs made by Herrera or Melka that cost 1/20 the price of Screaming Eagle and have a similar profile (some even less, like a bottle of Parallel).  Anybody looking for a huge red made by Heidi Barrett right now but doesn't want to pay the ""mystique"" pricing would do just as well plunking down ~$45 for the 2012 Lamborn anniversary zin.  But hey...if I had the cash floating around, I wouldn't say no to Screaming Eagle.  But I don't, so off to Parallel I go..."

(which is why it wasn't replanted several years ago to more common 10""(?) crossbar VSP.  It is a particularly notable location in Oakville, with red-volcanic hambright-complex soil type that fell down from the Pritchard Hill area in a landslide eons ago, which you only really find there and neighboring Rudd on the valley floor.

wine,34zfv8,Laplandia,1 point,Wed May 6 01:24:17 2015 UTC,Kanonkop is absolutely delicious. You can also try Barista which is a good wine in lower price range.
wine,34zfv8,anative,3,Wed May 6 12:54:50 2015 UTC,"Well made Pinotage can be incredible.    From South Africa look for Kanonkop (not their Kadette), Simonsig (I love their Redhill Pinotage), Ashbourne Red (not made every year), Chamonix (as square_mile mentioned) and Beyerskloof (especially their Diesel Pinotage).  From the US (yes we grow Pinotage in the US) look at Loma Prieta from CA (their Pinotage blend won best Red Wine in 2012 from the American Wine Society), Lovingston from VA and Melrose from OR.  For a full list of US grown Pinotage visit http://www.pinotageus.com  From New Zealand (Pinotage has been growing in New Zealand since 1959) look for Muddy Waters and Te Awa.  I always tell people to at what they are paying for the bottle.  You wouldn't expect much from a $15 CA Cab so don't be disappointed in a $15 Pinotage.    If you buy in the $30-$60 range you will be getting a significantly better bottle of wine."
wine,34zfv8,winemule,1 point,Wed May 6 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"Cheap Pinotage is awful. The big Kanonkop is a nice wine, as are others you've listed from South Africa. I'd add Warwick. I have to say, the best Pinotage I ever tasted was made by McNab Ridge (Founded by the great John Parducci) in Mendocino County."
wine,34zfv8,c0ldbl00d,1 point,Wed May 6 11:55:08 2015 UTC,+1 for Kanonkop and Chamonix. Another one on my list is Moreson.
wine,34zfv8,MsLailla,2,Wed May 6 13:35:27 2015 UTC,"I had my first Pinotage experience recently (2012 Spier 21 Gables), and when I poured it into the decanter, it reeked of stale cigarettes.  The scent was overpowering and nauseating.  I let it sit for an hour or so, and when I came back, it was a totally different wine in all the right ways.  Pleasant tobacco notes, dark fruit, and a really well-balanced wine.  I would definitely buy it again, but there's no way I'm getting anywhere near it without a good decant first."
wine,34zfv8,c0ldbl00d,1 point,Wed May 6 02:31:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, for me the only Pinotage that is palatable is old Pinotage. When it is primary and fruity, it is so often incredibly chewy and yes, often exhibits that banana, burnt rubber, volatile component which puts a lot of people off immediately."
wine,350la6,mentallo,6,Wed May 6 02:42:39 2015 UTC,"I think this is mostly happening in your head. No way all wines you open ""lose all punch and liveliness"" within 2 hours."
wine,350la6,arnaudh,2,Wed May 6 15:22:00 2015 UTC,That really depends on the wine. If it's ripe and ready from the get go then I would expect a decline in quality.
wine,350la6,fursink,-1,Wed May 6 03:30:11 2015 UTC,But there is a decline in taste after an hour no matter what the wine is right?
wine,350la6,ChalkyTannins,10,Wed May 6 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not - there are plenty of wines that benefit from longer decants.  Very young, tannic cabs may be best at 7-8 hours.  I routinely decant large CA cabs and bordeaux for 2-3 hours. I do the same with concentrated rhones from central coast (like Saxum and Herman Story).   Even some pinot, like Kosta Browne, really doesn't hit it's stride until 90 minutes at a minimum.  What sort of wine are you drinking that you find fades so fast?"

wine,350la6,Ganzer6,2,Wed May 6 06:15:28 2015 UTC,Very little can happen to a wine over the space of an hour unless you're deliberately trying to change it.  The hole in the top of the bottle doesn't really allow much oxygen in to oxidise the wine over such a small period of time.
wine,350la6,heavyhandedpour,1 point,Wed May 6 11:40:51 2015 UTC,"There is a change for sure, it's up to your perception whether it's a decline or not."
wine,350la6,dcloafer,2,Wed May 6 04:10:53 2015 UTC,"I would suggest this is perceived, not something changing in the wine. Especially because your first taste and glass of wine will be far more intense than it will if you wait an hour after your first glass. That said, this is a completely normal, natural way that most people experience wine. There's only a handful of types of wines that I like beyond a couple glasses. Your palate needs contrast for things to pop.  Lots of wines fall flat after time but it will take 12 hours at the very very least. In contrast, only super old wines with very little structure or remaining tannin will change that much in an hour.   Maybe monitor the temp of the wine? If you open a red wine at a decent chilled temp (under 60F) then it heats up to your house temp (maybe your at like 70F?) this could greatly change the flavor of the wine, though I don't know that it will make it go flat.  Or maybe try an experiment where you open two of the same wine an hour apart from each other. You could taste the first one, then open the second an hour later. Taste the first one a second time before you taste the freshly opened bottle. See if there is a difference.  Edit: clarity"
wine,34xabw,franzinator,3,Tue May 5 09:34:56 2015 UTC,"so this is a real gem. Producer is ""Villa di Capezzana"", from the northern part of toscana, in the Carmignano zone. It's a syrah, they've made only twice in their history, this is 2004, and 2012 is planned to be commercialized in 2018. it's a special edition for 1200 years of the first document referred to capezzana and carmignano wines. btw i've opened 3 bottles in last week and i would really share this because i've found this one of the best red ever tasted. despite it's 11 years old the wine is ready just opened; color is full red on the darker side. very fresh, perfum of pepper, leather, tobacco , all of them very clean and precise. Mouth is ""pulpy"" , you can almost bite it. very long persistance , beautiful in every aspect. a real surprise for a sangiovese voked zone.  the price is on the ""tignanello"" area, i 've paid it 37+ vat and i think you can find it 60/70 in stores."

wine,34yq30,CondorKhan,3,Tue May 5 18:26:09 2015 UTC,I actually don't mind spending $15-$20 on a bottle of wine.  Fortunately I make enough money to waste it on stuff like that.  So if anyone has suggestions in that range don't hesitate.
wine,34yq30,CondorKhan,3,Tue May 5 19:23:15 2015 UTC,"Fortunately the wines you want are in the sub $5 range, usually.  What you are asking for is wine for people that hate wine. Such wines tend to be very cheap and not very well regarded.  Brachetto is a rarity: a crisp, refreshing sweet red wine that is actually considered a quality product. You'll love it.  But I postulate that unless you have more context with a lot of different wines, sweet and dry, the difference in price between a nice Brachetto and a cheapo sweet red from CVS is not really going to get you more enjoyment.  By the way, you should have chocolate cake with your Brachetto."
wine,34yq30,GahMatar,3,Tue May 5 19:49:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the context!  Unfortunately for me I live in Utah and can't get wine shipped and I can't get wine from anywhere except state controlled liquor stores.  Lame.  But I figure they have to have some of the cheap fortified wines you were referring to.  Going to have to give those a shot!
wine,34yq30,fursink,7,Tue May 5 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"Explore white wines. I know a lot of newbies think white wines are not serious, not manly, not anything... But they're wrong. And whites are less bitter (no tannins), tend to have high acidity (crisp), nice fruit notes (from pears to apricot roughly) and a wide gamut of sweetness.  BTW, grapes and grape juices are way sweeter than almost all wines. All that alcohol in wines (usually 8-15%) used to be sugar."
wine,34yq30,GahMatar,4,Tue May 5 21:29:52 2015 UTC,"Your description really doesn't sound like you want to drink wine... at least not reds (which would rarely if ever be called crisp or refreshing).  For one, the process of turning fresh fruit into wine involves the conversion of sugar into alcohol (via yeast), hence why much of the sweetness of fresh fruit is gone in a wine.    You might try an off-dry riesling and see if you like that.  Otherwise plenty of cocktails will meet your criteria.  Edit: coherence"
wine,34yq30,fursink,1 point,Tue May 5 18:14:06 2015 UTC,"I think you meant conversion of sugar into alcohol. The yeasts are the little one-cell organisms that eat the sugar and shit it out as alcohol, until they run out of sugar, die of cold or drown in too much alcohol."

Just wanted to throw that out there because I often hear people claiming you don't have to pasteurize a sweet wine or cider if you ""cold crash"" the yeast...this is the kind of thinking that results in bottle bombs.    Likewise, alcohol (at levels seen in normal fermentation) doesn't actually kill yeast, they just cease growing and fermenting at an observable rate."

Pretty much any state  that grows North American hybrid varietals (the midwest does a lot of this) will have wines made from concord at the wineries and distributed to local grocery chains.  I have a friend with whom I've judge wine with who says ""you know you're drinking a concord if it feels like you are french kissing a jam jar.""  Some wineries will also have sweet red blends. Oliver in Indiana has a wine called soft red similar to what you are describing. I do not care for it, but it sounds like it fits the flavor profile you are describing."

Cliff Creek Cellars; these guys are Southern Oregon producer, but they have a tasting room in Newberg. I'm not sure if it was just nice because we had nothing but Pinot all day, but their Cab Franc and Merlot was amazing.   Food:   Recipe in Newberg (we actually ate here twice because it was so good). Red Hills Provincial Dining; amazing food, husband and wife run the restaurant out of the first floor of their home. Really fun experience. The Dundee Bistro (run by Ponzi); good lunch spot. Babica Hen Cafe; perfect for some eggs, bacon, and potatoes before drinking all day ;)   Other fun stuff:   Red Hills Market in Dundee; serves Stumptown coffee and has a great selection of Portland beers in case you want something different when you get back to where you're staying.

Most international forwarders offer LCL.   JF Hillebrand might be worth a look. We use them for some EU lanes. Their attentiveness is not all that great sometimes, you may have to be on their ass to make sure things are done properly and promptly, but they may have the network and service you're looking for. More importantly, they specialize in shipping wine and are familiar with many suppliers and what it will take to import/export wine, but they also can be expensive."

First I would determine exactly what your shipping needs are. Do you need pickup from supplier? Do you need delivery? Do you need customs clearance? Are there special compliance issues that need to be addressed? Will you need warehousing space to store? All of those questions and probably more need to be addressed.   Make sure you tell them exactly what you need so they can accurately quote you, learning incoterms will also help as that determines a shippers & sellers responsibility."

wine,34sqda,atleastbepolite,11,Mon May 4 06:16:03 2015 UTC,"Unless the wines are that exclusive or expensive, it's not that big of a deal. It's largely the same as when a bartender is pouring a glass of wine, there isn't enough to fill the glass, so they open another bottle to complete the pour.   It's kind of weird if they're pouring the wine back into another bottle, but again, unless we're talking ultra-premium wines, it doesn't really matter."

There is a hefty fine on the establishment as well as on the person.  Not including suspension or revocation of the establishments liquor license
wine,34sqda,GahMatar,1 point,Mon May 4 16:52:22 2015 UTC,"This is a MAJOR VIOLATION of alcohol laws in any state.   On what grounds?   Edit: So I used the Google machine to really look into the legalities of this. In most states there are laws dictating the practice of marrying spirits - precisely that any form of marrying or refilling liquor is illegal. That's not the case with wine. It is illegal to mix two different wines, pour a wine into a different bottle, or add another substance to a bottle of wine, but I found nowhere that it states the same marrying laws apply to wine."
wine,34sqda,arnaudh,1 point,Wed May 6 00:55:42 2015 UTC,"Meh, if the bottle are checked for defects and if they're open recently apart, it's a mild sin for cheap wines. Expensive or old wines however, that's pretty shitty. The different bottle thing is mostly to avoid fraud (cheap wine in expensive bottle) and tax dodging (in my jurisdiction, restaurants pay more then retail for booze, wine is a bit of a wash with sales tax but spirits are a different ballgame.)"
wine,34sqda,onehitwonder92,1 point,Tue May 5 00:14:19 2015 UTC,"Many restaurants and wineries I know do this as long as the bottles were opened on the same day.  I don't know about ABC regulations against this in California for restaurants, but I can tell you that even most high end wineries do this at the end of the day in their tasting rooms. Consolidating those bottles will require less argon and will minimize oxidation for re-use the next day.  I really don't see the issue as long as the wine was fine in each bottle. Unless there was a bottling or storage flaw, there shouldn't be any detectable difference between those wines, and there is no health violation I can fathom doing this."

I'm sitting here kicking it at the San Juan airport on a layover coming back from the British Virgin Islands. I had some time to kill so I thought, eh...my liver probably shouldn't endure anymore but YODWO (you only drink wine once). That's probably, not going to catch on.  So, I'm at some tapas restaurant where the list was slim. I ordered one wine...they were out. Ordered another, and they were out. The third time is the charm! Cillar D Silos. 2010. Ribera del Duero (whatever that means). I like Tempranillo, I wanted this Spanish beef stew, figured it would work.  It took about 20-30 minutes to open up. I was LESS than impressed at first. But honestly, it's not that bad. Price point: 50 dollars at an airport restaurant so I'm guessing it's a 15 dollar bottle of wine.  Solid garnet color. Medium viscosity. 14.5% ABV. The nose isn't complex but it's not one-sided. After you tread across the alcohol you can find some dried black fruit. Herbs. Maybe even a little licorice.  The structure is medium to probably more medium minus. Acidity medium minus. The berries on the nose don't exactly transcend onto the palate. They're there but more...tart. I'm not sure if that's the best explanation. There's a touch of earth. The tannins are pretty disappointing. It's difficult for me to believe this wine would last longer than 5 more years. The finish is interesting. Short. Then long. Then short. Then you realize...oh that's still going on afterwards. Kind of a roller coaster. It was definitely better with the food.  All in all its not bad. Not worth the price at a restaurant but come on...there's always a mark up. Should you see this at your local market...and you can let it sit for 30 minutes...and it's 20 dollars or under...I think you should pull the trigger."

However, I did note something.. if you want Spanish wine, Puerto Rico is as good a place as any to get it... we were on the way to the beach and stopped by a grocery store to get like, chips and beer. Decided to check their wine selection for shits and giggles and noticed they had like 4 aisles of Spanish wine. No store that I've seen here in the East Coast has such a good selection as this small beach grocery store in Puerto Rico. A full aisle of Albarino. All the Rioja and Ribera you could want. Toro, Bierzo, you name it. I ended up buying 2005 Vina Alberdi, and drank it at the beach from a coffee mug.   A few days later, we were doing Christmas shopping at the mall in San Juan, and there was this popup wine store selling ALL THE VINTAGES of Vega Sicilia Unico. And they were just lying out there for anyone to handle! I almost bought one but then remembered that $400 is $400."

wine,34ncut,walt_bishop,5,Sat May 2 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"Congrats on finding something you like and hopefully getting into wine.  Many people on this sub, myself included, are big fans of Rieslings, so welcome to the club.  I find that there is generally a big jump in quality going from £5 to  £10-13.  You can try other Rieslings in dry and off-dry styles. The most famous regions are the Mosel in Germany and Alsace in France.  For a different type of wine, try a Gewurztraminer. I think you may like it."
wine,34ncut,Muppet_Mower,3,Sat May 2 19:32:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate the advice! I'm very lucky to live near a wine shop where you can put money on a card and then try little glasses of lots of different wines, so I'll definitely go and try some more Rieslings and Gequrztraminers."
wine,34ncut,Muppet_Mower,3,Sat May 2 19:36:04 2015 UTC,"If you've got access to a shop like that, you are set. Just tell them what you posted here, and I'm sure they can make some great suggestions."
wine,34ncut,huxley2112,2,Sat May 2 19:40:06 2015 UTC,"Wonderful, it was actually a sommelier from that shop that I got the wine from today - they had a bar at an event I was at. I'll make sure to check it out."
wine,34ncut,GahMatar,4,Sat May 2 19:41:32 2015 UTC,If they are in a store they are not likely a somm. We in retail know more than those chumps.   Also try halbtrocken rieslings. It is a category of sweetness not a brand but it's equivalent to Kungfu girl
wine,34ncut,suchanjv,5,Sat May 2 22:05:11 2015 UTC,"If you like WA Riesling, I'd suggest Alsace Riesling, especially if you liked the minerality.  Just off the top of my head, I'd suggest Trimbach.  Readily available, affordable and has what I think you are looking for.  Welcome to the world of Riesling, its a great place to hang!"
wine,34ncut,wepoozel,1 point,Sat May 2 23:36:29 2015 UTC,"I loved the minerality, Trimbach is on the list. Thank you."
wine,34ncut,deliaaaaaa,4,Sun May 3 11:36:43 2015 UTC,"Kung Fu Girl is generally off-dry. That means that it is a little sweet. The natural acidity of Riesling can often mask the sweetness however.  There's a sea of fantastic riesling out there and your best bet is a good local retailer with a nice selection and good advice.  Welcome to the club.  Austria is an off-the-beaten path source of nice (usually) dry Riesling with perhaps a lower acidity then a Kabinett from Germany. Hirsch is a personal favourite producer, but the overall quality in Austria is good and you can rarely go wrong."

wine,34ncut,gluontunes,3,Sun May 3 11:37:13 2015 UTC,I feel like you may enjoy viogners. They have a very nice minerally quality to them. I find they have similar qualities to both chardonnay and sauvignon blanc. You also might like the torrontes variety native to argentina.
wine,34ncut,benchley,1 point,Sun May 3 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I've added Viogners and Torrontes to the list!"
wine,34ncut,gluontunes,2,Sun May 3 11:35:47 2015 UTC,"Other North American Rieslings are generally going to be much sweeter than Kung Fu Girl (that was the first wine I fell in love with,  too)  I would next try some German Kabinett Riesling (might be a teensy bit sweeter than Kung Fu but you'll still get that minerality) or white blends with grapes like viognier, chenin blanc, or torrontes.    If you're looking for a bit of a splurge,  I'd also recommend the Merry Edwards Sauvignon Blanc.  It's made with a tiny bit of the sauvignon musque grape so it has a light hint of sweetness & a lovely honeydew melon flavor.  That's my fave stuff at the moment."
wine,34omu6,themayker,1 point,Sun May 3 02:43:54 2015 UTC,Looks like a flight of wines from the 10 to 12 dollar range in Ontario.   The Sauv blanc from Jackson Triggs (Third from right in second flight) looks pretty heavily oxidized.
wine,34omu6,spaceballs-1,1 point,Sun May 3 02:49:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the price range! Yea we're in Toronto.  What does oxidized mean in relation to wine? is that a good thing or bad thing? is it safe to drink? all the bottles were stored in the garage for a while, going through winter."
wine,34omu6,spaceballs-1,3,Sun May 3 02:58:18 2015 UTC,"Oxidized means that the wine has been subjected to excess air and or heat. It's safe to drink but not very tasty. It will be full of off flavours that are tough for me to describe. Toss that one.   If the wine was stored in the garage for last summer none of it may be very good as it's possible that it got cooked.   Oh and toss the ""Botticelli"" and the ""Domaine D'or"". They were shit the day they were bottled."
wine,34omu6,huxley2112,2,Sun May 3 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"Oxidized means that the wine has been subjected to excess air and or heat   Not necessarily.  Some wines turn brown over age without oxidizing, e.g. sauternes.  It's not a smoking gun for poor storage conditions, but it's a smoking gun for old undrinkable sauvignon blancs."
wine,34omu6,spaceballs-1,1 point,Sun May 3 05:32:15 2015 UTC,"Good to know, I'll dump those bottles. The rest is good? I mean good enough to drink and enjoy even if cheap?"
wine,34omu6,A_different_era,1 point,Sun May 3 03:15:23 2015 UTC,"Good enough.   But in case you don't like one or another, do what my Italian friends do. Add some Ginger Ale!"

wine,34omu6,heavyhandedpour,1 point,Sun May 3 03:43:39 2015 UTC,It's the brownest Sauvignon Blanc I've ever seen!
wine,34omu6,sempronialou,1 point,Sun May 3 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know what kind of details you are looking for here, the brands, vintages and varietals are all on the labels.  Look them up on Cellartracker.com if you want specifics.  u/spaceballs-1 said that the sauv blanc looks oxidized... I'd go further and say that most of those look shot.  Go ahead and try them, you won't get sick or anything, they will just taste awful.  I don't recognize anything age worthy there, and there are lots of old vintages (and brown chardonnays... that's not good).  That BV Coastal is funny, that's about 3 label changes ago.  I'm surprised it isn't as brown as the Jackson Triggs."
wine,34nh2i,ScalaZen,8,Sat May 2 19:45:24 2015 UTC,"Look for Paso Robles blends. The Prisoner typically had a lot of Syrah, Petit Sirah, and other big flavor grapes in them. Paso is doing similar wines but really high quality. McPrice Meyers, Epoch, Booker, Linne Calodo, Torrin, ... there's quite a few that are fantastic."
wine,34nh2i,jd7509,1 point,Sat May 2 20:54:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the list. I'll have to see if my local store has them!
wine,34nh2i,flitcroft,5,Sun May 3 02:34:03 2015 UTC,"If you like the style and aren't hung up on replicating the exact blend, check out Sans Leige The Offering.

It's worth seeking out— don't let the lower price dissuade you.  http://www.sansliege.com/product/2012-OFFERING"
wine,34nh2i,fursink,2,Sat May 2 22:39:34 2015 UTC,"I came here to say check out the offering.  As it creeps up in price, there's also the Groundwork line and Field Recordings.  I think there's (some) overlap in wine makers in all three."
wine,34nh2i,I_See_Wrong_People,1 point,Sat May 2 23:50:04 2015 UTC,Sounds interesting. I'll have to give it a try
wine,34nh2i,heavyhandedpour,1 point,Sun May 3 02:36:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't care if it's a replica or something else that's similar in blends. As long as it's smooth and flavorful.
wine,34nh2i,heavyhandedpour,4,Sun May 3 02:36:04 2015 UTC,"Michael David wines are a great, similar style for someone who likes the big, extracted style California red blends.   Earthquake Cab and Zin, 6th Sense Syrah, and Petit Petite are some decent ones from that line. They should be widely available at almost any decent store. A few Earthquake wines can get pricey, but the rest are all under $20."
wine,34nh2i,mocollin,7,Sat May 2 22:02:43 2015 UTC,Ridge makes Zin-based blends that are waaaay better made than Prisoner ever was. Similarly priced and really good winemaking. Give them a try.  Edit: One of my favorite bottlings that's relatively easy to find: http://www.ridgewine.com/Wines/Zinfandel/Geyserville
wine,34nh2i,masonba,5,Sat May 2 19:53:09 2015 UTC,Except they aren't like the prisoner.
wine,34nh2i,Brownielf,1 point,Sat May 2 21:56:42 2015 UTC,I'm totally fine with them not being like the prisoner. It just was very nice to have that fruitful smooth taste before dinner wine. Thanks for sharing.
wine,34nh2i,draymond3,2,Sun May 3 02:37:47 2015 UTC,"Ridge is incredible but very different. Draper, the winemaker who created Ridge, has a style that is very natural. Dave Phinney who created the prisoner is more apt to use modern tech and his wines have a riper profile.   The prisoner's sweet tannin is something you won't find in Ridge. It's not that I don't recommend them, I do strongly, just they aren't that similar."
wine,34nh2i,LeepaTime,2,Sun May 3 03:12:23 2015 UTC,I'm definitely going to try ridge someone else recommended it to me it has to be good.
wine,34nh2i,protovince,1 point,Sun May 3 03:22:40 2015 UTC,"Ya It's definitely not the same, so sorry I didn't answer the question directly, but it's what I would recommend to a friend if they liked prisoner and wanted something new to try."
wine,34nh2i,Pr0clivity,1 point,Sun May 3 15:08:24 2015 UTC,I would go with Bogle Phantom. It is much more modern and has some durif in it IIRC.

It's a Napa Valley, about half is Cabernet Sauvignon, throw in some Merlot and Malbec with dashes of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, adds some great depth and fruit.   It may not be as chewy as The Prisoner, but had some nice cherry and vanilla that reminded of The Prisoner.   I got it for 18.99 in upstate NY."

wine,34oawu,KayakAndTonic,2,Sun May 3 21:41:45 2015 UTC,Many many articles have been written about these clubs such as the WSJ wine club and Zagat Wine Club etc. Many of them are just rebranding of the same service from a single company.   All your value is in the first intro shipment of 12 bottles for a discounted price. All future shipments are break even or worse.   I recommend you instead find a local independent wine shop and join their club. You will get higher quality juice and you can pick it up instead of paying for shipping. Also joining a local club will typically get you store wide discounts from that shop.   If you have no good local shops I recommend the wine club from Kermit Lynch who imports a lot of good values from France.
wine,34oawu,mocollin,1 point,Mon May 4 14:16:13 2015 UTC,"Well, at least it's not one of the big guys that do private labels / branding.  BTW, Plonk does not do CA wines (or at least, rarely)."

wine,34m8qv,easymz,7,Sat May 2 12:38:32 2015 UTC,Just FYI in CDP they believe that 2010 will be one of the most historic awesome vintages so it has lots of aging potential. But drinking it now would be pretty delicious too. Probably couldn't go wrong either way.
wine,34m8qv,Lets_put_a_smile,3,Sat May 2 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"Well luckily I called the store I purchased the one from, and they had two left put aside for me. So I guess I should age the other two?"

wine,34m8qv,HRP,2,Sat May 2 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"2010 vintage should go down as a very classic, age-worthy vintage. If you can buy 3 (why not for $20) drink one now, then keep the other 2. CNdP for $20 although this Paul Jourdan isn't one of the better known producers. 5 years on a decent CNdP is not too young so now it should be pretty good, but I wouldn't go more than 5 more years."

It isn't an expensive wine. In fact, it was probably well past its ideal drinking window.  You can go to a wine shop and buy a similarly priced Gigondas(so what if it's younger), or shop around online for an old Gigondas.  I found this."

wine,34jirw,JrDot13,1 point,Sat May 2 04:11:15 2015 UTC,High quality marijuana can be very flavorful and nuanced. The flavors alone would be interesting to match with wines. You also have the mental and physical changes brought on by the marijuana which can make anything involving taste more enjoyable imo.
wine,34jirw,vinothrowaway,1 point,Sat May 2 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"I've done it, but haven't documented it at all. I usually enjoy a hit or two from the vape and then a glass of wine.  The article is correct, you'll want to start slow with this in order to avoid getting caught off guard. For me, they tend to amplify each other, especially if I'm smoking an indica/indica-heavy strain.  I would def recommend vaping it though, the taste of burnt plant matter will destroy your palate for the wine to follow."

wine,34hgqb,Socrates5150,3,Fri May 1 04:36:31 2015 UTC,"So, we got our allocation of the Ganevat wines a couple weeks ago and I've been dying to try one but the prices are a bit steep this year so I kept putting it off. Well, tonight I finally brought home the Jean Francois Ganevat Julien en Billat 2013 which, as far as I can make out is a cuvee made from two plots of Pinot Noir: the first is the plot that usually makes up the majority of his Cuvee Julien which consists of 38 year old vines planted on clay and limestone and the 25 year old plot that usually makes up the En Billat which is planted on schist and marl. This particular parcel was planted by Ganevat at a high altitude and the very low-yield grapes are destemmed by hand and allowed to macerate for an extended period.  The wine is definitely dynamic and changed immensely over the course of five hours or so. The color is awesome and the photo doesn't do it justice as it has a glowing magenta core with shades of pink near the rim. The nose is a bit more simple than the palate with focused cherry and a slight earthy note. This shines on the palate with a beautiful core of cherry with edges of cinnamon and dried leaves and a wonderful menthe note. After a few hours a nice mineral note shines through in the mid palate that feels like a mix between stones and and a metallic sense. Well structured but seamlessly integrated so that this is pleasurable from first sip and the tannins are only felt slightly as a dusty sensation on the rear palate and the acid provides more lift to the fruit than any tartness.  This is one of those wines with obvious flaws and yet they all work well together and produce a well balanced and beautiful wine. When first opened there was a touch of effervescence that was a bit worrying but it blew off in 15 minutes or so and the wine continued to develop beautifully over the course of the evening. I'm going to vacu-pump it and revisit it tomorrow to see how it develops over night."
wine,34hgqb,Muppet_Mower,3,Fri May 1 04:38:23 2015 UTC,This is one of those wines with obvious flaws   What are the flaws?
wine,34hgqb,cmshort21,3,Fri May 1 11:08:44 2015 UTC,"The effervescence at the beginning was a big one. I don't think it was bottle fermentation but it was very off-putting, especially considering the price ($75). Also, it's not quite a brett smell or taste to the wine, but there is something that I get with a lot of biodynamic wines were it's almost a slight yeasty note. It's subtle, but enough so that if I had it blind I'd peg it for bio immediately.   edit: had to make my words make sense."
wine,34hgqb,HRP,3,Fri May 1 12:22:35 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not bottle fermentation as there is no residual sugar in the wine. If this was the case, you would also have a lot of dead yeast cells at the bottom of the bottle as well as much more pronounced bubbles.  No, in this case, these wines are fermented at cool, controlled temperatures to retain as much fruit and aroma as possible. Also, the cellars are kept very cool as well so when the wine is bottled it still retains some dissolved CO2 from the primary fermentation."
wine,34hgqb,andtheodor,1 point,Fri May 1 16:00:49 2015 UTC,"This makes the most sense since the ""bubbles"" blow off so quickly and completely."

wine,34hgqb,chapster1989,1 point,Fri May 1 13:14:19 2015 UTC,How does it command that price? Is this a well known Jura producer that I'm just unaware of?
wine,34h6vp,mrfisk14,3,Fri May 1 03:00:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry that should be Gabriele Rausse, not Pausse. My bad.  I got this from a friend so it's not normally one I would pick out myself. I've been wanting to try more Virginia wine since it's where I'm living right now. The Gabriele Rausse is an Italian-influenced wine.  The Old World influences are clear in this wine: cigar box, pencil shavings, green pepper and the slightest hint of the milk chocolate make their appearance known on the nose. On the palate, it is medium-bodied at 13% ABV, with lighter tannins and red fruit flavors. It has a sour cherry finish that's thrown off-balance by a good amount of heat. It's a solid effort, but not well balanced in my opinion.  If you're in the mood for a lighter Cabernet Sauvignon, I'd check this wine out."
wine,34h6vp,clbarnes,1 point,Fri May 1 03:08:06 2015 UTC,I don't think you can get it outside of Virginia. Gabriele is a super interesting guy and head of the grounds at Monticello. They sell his wine in the gift shop there.

wine,34h6vp,Muppet_Mower,1 point,Fri May 1 13:33:26 2015 UTC,That's the problem with budding states such as ours (even though Finger Lakes Riesling has made a name for itself). There's not really a demand for it so prices have to be high to get any sort of ROI.

wine,34dg1p,Ganzer6,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"True true, but the mere act of pouring the wine into a decanter can give the whole bottle a nice bit of oxygen before you eventually pour individual glasses."
wine,34dg1p,norwegianatheist,12,Thu Apr 30 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"Nah. Not for me. Everyone's lifestyle and drink style is different and I would never say having an aerator is wrong or unimportant for a particular person!  But as for me, I am lucky enough to have a good stock of every day bottles along with my keepers, and I have a decanter. I just use that baby if I need a bit of an aerate. I find it more interesting to watch the wine develop as it opens and if I'm having a bottle, I take time for that.  I know a lot of people say aerating cheap wine makes a difference, but I've never tried and if I'm having very cheap wine, I am probably having it with friends and we're just out for a good time. So long as the wine is halfway decent, I probably won't care. :)"
wine,34dg1p,ourmodelcitizen,2,Thu Apr 30 11:41:52 2015 UTC,My girlfriends mother gave us an aerator as a gift. Lucky I can use it to sit ontop of my beautiful decanter to keep the dust out. Great gift!
wine,34dg1p,FrodoUnderhill,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't use an aerator ever really. I'll decant most wines however (either for sediment, presentation or effect) and have been known to double decant if I think it's needed. In general though a properly sized glass is all you need.  I played around with hyper-decanting (sorry, the term amuses me) and while it does change the wine, I'm far from sold on the idea that it improves most. Plus, I think it is more fun to let the wine change over time on it's own.  Now, if it makes a guest happier and plays to their anticipation of a wine then sure, I'll use one. It's a gimmick though."

I can also just use it as a regular decanter which is often what I will do for older wines.  http://www.amazon.com/Menu-Deluxe-Wine-Breather-Carafe/dp/B00FG4TXPI

I think the aerators work well, however I've a had a decanter long before I started seeing aerators in the markets. Perhaps my preference is bias.

Aerator can literally taste fine 2 minutes after pouring but if the bottles been open an hour then using an aerator is too much. Again, I'm talking cheap bottles here, less than £10, 13.5-14.5%. Usually merlot, cab sav, new world, chile my fave."
wine,34dg1p,Muppet_Mower,4,Thu Apr 30 16:09:14 2015 UTC,tastes best between 30minutes to 90   This is entirely dependant on the wine. Some can require 2+ hours to come around.

wine,34dg1p,kojenja,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"You have to taste the wine first to see if it needs it.  If it's tight, (muted flavor, aroma, overpowering tannen) I ususally just throw it in a decanter, taste every half hour or so until it's where you want it to be.    If you don't have a ""proper"" decanter, fret not.  Any sort of water pitcher, preferably glass, will do the trick."

In Barcelona, if you're at all into natural wine, Bar Brutal and L'anima del Vi are both less than a minute from each other and excellent. They both have good food too. I love the goose rillettes at L'anima del Vi. It's owned by a French guy who imports all the wine himself, and cooks the food. It's mostly classic French, but with jamon and all that too. I'd also recommend Vila Vinateca for buying wine, they're my favorite wine store in Barcelona I think, and they have a store next to it where you can drink wine by the glass and have awesome cheese and charcuterie. General suggestion, anchovies are a hugely underrated Spanish food. Them, some pan con tomate and a good vermouth is one of life's great pleasures."

You keep it out of the sun, and keep it sideways.  Of course a climate controlled, humidity controlled room is ideal but it can be done otherwise, I don't know why it would need to cost more than the bottle to cover the bottle in tissue and put it in a box under your stairs."

Didn't you just describe most basements?  That is exactly what every basement I have had has been like-  Doesn't freeze (or really, even get very cold) even in the most frigid of winters (like, -20 Fahrenheit) and it is no more than 70, tops, during the hottest (90+) summer days.

wine,34a99z,RowanStewart,2,Sat May 2 01:47:43 2015 UTC,"Ya, must be a regional difference. Nearly all homes here in Maine have basements.

I thought the states was supposed to have modern housing, but even in the days before climate control everyone kept there bottles in cellars, which are basically basements. Wine is not going to give up and throw a fit because of a bit of seasonal variation. Most wineries I know don't even have humidity/temp control for there archive rooms, its just a basement/barrel hall room."

wine,34a99z,Doomaise,3,Wed Apr 29 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"My suggestions would be: Chateauneuf du Pape - at your price range, those bottles will come from producers that can make an age worthy and delicious bottle of wine even if 2015 is a less than ideal vintage in Southern Rhone.  Vintage Port - you'll have to wait to see if it's declared a vintage first, but if it is, this is a wine that you can not only drink on your son/daughters 18/21st birthday, but also his/her wedding day, and likely the day that your first grandchild is born.    You mentioned sweet white wines, so with that in mind, I'd suggest a Sauternes for a dessert wine that can last that long, or if you still want sweet, but in the 'table wine' type, you could get some incredible German Reislings that would age well."
wine,34a99z,andtheodor,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:02:58 2015 UTC,"20 years is a pretty long time for CdP from most producers, even in a good year. Beaucastel is probably your best bet in that regard as they always age very well."
wine,34a99z,Doomaise,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:35:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, most producers won't push 20 years unless it's a historic type vintage, but I think at the $100 - $300 range, unless it's a disaster of a vintage, there will be a bunch of the top producers that can make a 20+ year age worthy wine.  I'd look at Beaucastel, Beaurenard, Henri Bonneau, Bosquet des Papes, Clos des Papes, La Janesse, Le Vieux Donjon, Vieux Telegraphe, Rayas...and I'm sure there are others."

Holding any bottle for 20+ years is going to be somewhat of a crap shoot, especially since it's unlikely that the OP has ideal cellaring conditions.  So many things can go wrong over that amount of time.  At the end of the day, no one really knows how well a wine will age.  Especially considering the evolution that many classic wines have taken in terms of style from both winemaking changes, to climate change.  Will today's CdPs play out the same way that the 95's did?  That's a interesting question."

Philippe Foreau  The tricky part is that you can't really buy wines from his/her birth year before he/she's born. So, if you're going with any year I would recommend his goutte d'or from 2011. Goutte d'or is his top bottling that is only made on perfect harvests. To date this includes only 3 vintages (1947, 1990, 2011). The 2011 I bought last year for $220 and was told to cellar it for up to 100 years.  I've had his moelleux before and it's beautiful and some of the best drinking experiences I've ever had. I can't even fathom how good the goutte d'or will be."

Plus you need to add the risk that the wine might be corked. So I'd maybe buy a couple of bottles each. I know Italian wines so I'm going to suggest:   Barolo or Barbaresco: Giacomo Conterno or Bruno Giacosa or Cappellano  Sagrantino di Montefalco: can't recommend any producers I just don't know this wine well enough but I do know it can age well Taurasi / Aglianico: some Riserva from Mastroberardino or Cantine del Notaio. One of the very best wines I've ever had was a Taurasi Riserva Radici Mastroberardino that was 20 years old at the time I drank and still had the tannins of a baby wine"

wine,34a99z,AsthmaticMechanic,2,Wed Apr 29 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"My father bought a bottle of Penfolds Grange for me and my brother to have on our 20th/21st birthday. I can honestly say it was one of the greatest wines I've ever tried, but I don't put it down to grange being the greatest wine in the world or anything. I think the atmosphere, the wait, the story about it, these are the sorts of things that are going to make the bottle memorable and as long as you pick a bottle that can last 20 years and still taste good (doesn't have to be great) you're going to be fine.  Remember that its going to be important to store it properly especially if it has a true cork. IMO these days I'd go for screw cap, some great NZ pinots, CAN/US wines, and South American wines are under screw cap, and it would make the risk and storage a little bit easier.   In fact this is probably a great excuse to put in a little wine cellar! I remember going down to the cellar to chose a wine for the adults, (I couldn't drink yet) and I'd always have to take a look at the Grange, for some reason just seeing 1992 on it made it feel unique. Also by cellar I really mean basement with a bunch of wine racks, so its an achievable prospect :)"
wine,34a99z,sckewer,2,Thu Apr 30 00:28:42 2015 UTC,"While you wait for for the wines to age, mature and be released, maybe in 3 years or so, try to drink more wine and develop your palate to find more wines that you like. If you buy sweeter Riesling of Spat or Auslese quality, you might not really like that in 15 years, and reds are usually more fun too age anyway. What you like about young sweeter whites, I don't think you'll like about aged sweeter whites."

wine,34a8st,TheToolMan,23,Wed Apr 29 15:19:40 2015 UTC,Go to tastings at wine shops nearby. Trying lots of wines against each other is the best way to figure out what you like.

I usually start the youth around me with entry level whites like maybe a slightly sweeter one (California or German Gewertztraminer, Italian Moscato, a better brand of it, or a Reisling) then we progress to less sweet whites and onto reds that are smooth, sometimes sweeter reds just to make the bridge over to reds, then we move on up from lighter to bigger.

wine,34a8st,unthused,4,Wed Apr 29 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with this; my introduction was with whites and sweeter reds, then gradually progressed to dryer/heavier reds as I developed more of a taste for it.

wine,34a8st,creon,0,Wed Apr 29 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"If you like softer sweeter reds You might like a Hungarian Blaufränkisch .. also try a South African Pinotage , then maybe try Malbec and move more toward cabs and merlots after youve started to try a few varietals.

wine,34a8st,Ziggy_A,3,Thu Apr 30 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with visiting your local wine shops. Not only can you figure out what you like, but also why you like them, so you can find others like it. Pairing helps, as well.   But I'd also start with identifying what flavors you think you'd like. Tart, zesty, sweet, smokey, etc. then research some wines in your price range that might fit the bill. I like buying 2 of the same wines from different areas and comparing them. You'll figure out quickly what characteristics/flavors you prefer. If sweeter Moscatos are your thing, find a few & see which you like best!"

wine,34a8st,HamletElsinore,3,Wed Apr 29 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I also like unsweet tea with Lemon. For something a bit tangier/citrusy maybe try a Sauvingnon Blanc from New Zealand (my favorite white). Also, while there are inevitably ""good"" and ""bad"" wines, cheap and expensive wines, just try to focus on what you want. One of my favorite go-to bottles is an $8 Clos du Bois Pinot Grigio.   The thing that makes a wine ""good"" is if you like it or not. :)"
wine,34a8st,Dave_Hulud,3,Wed Apr 29 21:27:30 2015 UTC,"Try every varietal you can (i.e. - Merot, Pinot, Zinfandel) - A lot of times i see new wine drinkers jump right to Cabernet because that's what they have heard of before and know is supposed to be ""good"" but it might not be right for you, nor what you would be looking for in wines. Try EVERYTHING you can, and don't skip over the Whites"

That would have likely mellowed the flavors and made it more enjoyable.  What did you not like about it?  As others have said, you can try wine tastings at local shops.  I'd also recommend going to a nice restaurant, sitting at the bar, telling the bartender what you like and then asking for a taste of a couple wines before you commit to a glass (or better yet, ask if they will do a half glass.)  Tell them what you like about it and grow from there."

wine,34a8st,ourmodelcitizen,0,Wed Apr 29 22:05:22 2015 UTC,"If possible, steer clear of California wine as your starting out.  You can always return to tasting in this region.  Especially California Cabernets.  You have the rest of your life to decide that you (might) like that style.    Cali Cabernet is a BIG wine.   It has: High level of tannin (that is the gripping sensation you get when you taste oversteeped tea..it is more of a tactile fuzzy sensation...tannin and bitter are actually different things) which comes from both extended NEW OAK barrel aging + the Cabernet grapes themselves.  This is sorta like the beer equivilent of a Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout. Heavy, not refreshing, full bodied (almost has the texture of milk).  These are styles that frankly, I do not enjoy.  And I think it can be very detrimental to beginners in wine to start with wines of this style.  Why don't you start with reds on the lighter end of the spectrum:  1) Find a GOOD shop that specializes in wine.  2) Seek out some ""Beaujolais-Village"" (Christophe Pacalet is a killer producer).  While your at it, ask the attendant to show you a bottle of ""Cru"" level Beaujolais: ""Fleurie"" is the name of one of the more common Crus.  Taste these two side by side.  The Beajolais-Village will be lighter in body.  The Cru will be heavier.  Same grape.  Both are fruity and refreshing compared to that last bottle you had. They both are killer with just about any dish you can have (from steak to spaghetti).  (**Beaujolais Nouveau is likely to be the thing the clerk points you too, BUT avoid it for now.  Come back to it when you know what it is later.  It's not even really wine although it has its time and place...but I digress...)  Shoot me a PM if you want advice.  No question is a stupid question."
wine,34a8st,Doomaise,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:30:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you so much for the reply. I am going to a local store that specializes in wine this weekend. I will follow your advice. What do you recommend spending per bottle?"
wine,34a8st,square_mile,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:31:21 2015 UTC,"not who you're responding to, but 20 bucks will get you into solidly nice ""village"" level and cheaper cru-level. 15 bucks will probably get you fine ""village"" level, would be my guess knowing absolutely nothing about booze prices wherever you live."
wine,34a8st,ourmodelcitizen,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"No worries mate.  With regards to pricing, j_patrick_12 below is spot on.   I would do this:  Grab a Beaujolais-Villages for under $12-15 or so.  (Christophe Pacalet is a killer producer, and his B-V crushes it.) If you have extra coin to spend, get a Cru Beaujolais.  Fleurie is a common one you'll see.  Ask a worker for help if need be.  Shoot me a PM and I'd be glad to give you some futher advice so that you can start to learn what YOU LIKE.  That's the most important thing after all, since it is YOUR money and YOUR palate.  If you flip the bottle around and see Kermit Lynch listed as the importer on any bottle, your in good hands.  If you let me know what market/city you live in, I can give you more specific advice.  And trust me on this:  stick with it.  I can promise you that there is a wine (many actually) out there that you will absolutely adore.  You just don't know what it is yet since you haven't had many.  go to the LocalWineEvents.com (I think thats the URL) and lookup events in your area.  If you can find an event that lets you taste 20+ wines for less than the cost of a bottle, you are well on your way.  Good luck!   PS: Shun the snobs.  Most of them don't actually know what they are talking about."

wine,34a8st,square_mile,3,Wed Apr 29 22:03:42 2015 UTC,"A lot of Beaujolais is definitely at the end of the spectrum on the light side, definitely. Probably the majority of it. But there are cru Beaujolais--like this person is recommending--that are a lot heavier than typical and are more like a Pinot. I've done blind tastings using Cru Beaujolais and often no one saw it coming.   A big favourite of mine is Moulin-a-Vent (Domaine Diochon, especially)."
wine,34a8st,ourmodelcitizen,2,Wed Apr 29 23:13:25 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I've had a few Moulin-a-Vent that I could have sworn were Pinot that I really enjoyed, and I don't like Gamay at all."

wine,34a8st,scuba_davis,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:03:57 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I'm biased because Cru Beaujolais was my introduction as a beginner a few years ago and I felt it was my ""aha"" wine, the wine that brought me to understand why people spend money on wines that are higher than the old $10 and under.   Additionally--at least in my area--good Bourgogne Pinot is difficult to find at an accessible price point unless you know the right places/people to talk to, and that's what I've heard from many in other places.

The only trick - which really isn't that tricky - is to know if you should go for white or red. Seafood? White's probably your best bet. Poultry? The sauce will decide if you should go for white or red. Red meat? Red's usually your best option. In doubt, rosé always works with pretty much everything.

wine,349hez,winemule,3,Wed Apr 29 10:58:50 2015 UTC,"I like this article... As OP says, wine isn't mentioned in it, but I do feel it sort of applies as the word 'natural' has been somewhat hijacked to describe what I, personally, would term 'minimal intervention'. Wine doesn't just 'naturally' happen - vinifera vines don't 'naturally' train themselves onto a 2-wire trellis and drop canes or thin their own shoots, they don't drop leaves when vigour is too high, they don't magic water or nutrients into the ground when they're under stress, they don't fling their berries into presses and then oak barrels or stainless steel or terracotta amphorae or big cement eggs or whatever and they don't bottle themselves once the (admittedly sometimes totally natural) process of fermentation has taken place. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against minimal intervention wines and am all for taking more care in the vineyard AND winery, but I really think 'natural' is a misnomer.  ...sorry, got carried away, and it's probably not even that relevant... Clearly I've got a bee in my bonnet about this :/"

wine,346tw2,HornetAttack,11,Tue Apr 28 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"On Saturday I had a dozen people over for my wine birthday celebration. It was a great group and we drank some great wines as well!  2002 Bouchard Montrachet - This was a great white Burgundy, showing copious yellow fruit and great power. Despite the concentration, there was a sense of precision that really rounded this wine out. This really blossomed into something special with lots of time in the decanter, with enveloping aromas and flavors. Lovely.  2010 DRC Echezeaux - This was dominated by dark fruit, dark florality, and a certain spiciness on the nose that I associate with DRC. Lots of structure here, but still supple in the mouth. Despite its youth, I thought this showed very well, though its potential for substantial improvement is incredibly obvious.    2006 DRC Romanee St. Vivant - After spending a couple hours in the decanter, this was showing a really pretty nose of flowers and bright red fruit. The palate was very tight initially, but I thought that it opened up appreciably with air and by the end of the night was drinking very well, with a silky texture and nice fruit presence.    1996 Coche-Dury Meursault 1er Cru Caillerets - Initially, I wasn't terribly impressed, especially next to the Bouchard. Throughout the night - and after a double decant - the wine really opened up, and by the time I got to my last glass this was really something, with that classic Coche matchstick, a hint of spice, and generous white fruit and flowers.  1986 Roumier Ruchottes-Chambertin - One of the noses of the night to me, with an alluring perfume of flowers, strawberry, and gentle spice. This was a bit light on the palate, where it showed its age somewhat, but it was still terrific. Definitely a fan favorite, despite one vocal detractor ;-).  1990 Dujac Echezeaux - Characteristic Dujac perfume of stem-driven spice, flowers and snappy red berries. Oh how I love that Dujac nose! This had very nice fruit on the palate, and I thought it firmed up over time. Where initially it seemed a little light at first, it became fleshier and more substantial throughout the night. Fred set aside a small glass early in the night and it was showing incredibly well hours after being opened. Great stuff.  1988 Salon Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut - Oxidized or not oxidized, that was the question. The answer was ""slightly oxidized."" There was apple, a very slight breadiness, and some nice tertiary components alongside the oxidative notes. Minimal effervescence, but still an enjoyable drink. I'm glad to have tried this, but I think that there are probably better bottles out there.  1997 Alain Hudelot-Noellat Romanee St. Vivant - This was a great surprise. Really nice spice and chunky dark fruit on both the nose and palate. This had a solid palate presence, and had great acidity to balance out the fruit. I really liked this!  1997 Leroy Beaux Monts - This had a pretty nose of dark fruit and spice, but it was a bit clunky on the palate. Still enjoyable, but a bit disappointing for a Leroy BM.  1995 Pierre Morey Meursault 1er Cru Les Perrieres - This was a nice Perrieres, showing round yellow fruit and slight florals, although it could have used a bit more acidity.  1954 R. Lopez de Heredia Rioja Gran Reserva Vina Tondonia - This was a real treat. Initially this was dominated by dried flowers, berries, and earthy notes. These eventually softened into a really pretty mix with acidity adding a nice bit of freshness to the mature earthy elements. Great.  1999 Domaine d'Auvenay (Lalou Bize-Leroy) Auxey-Duresses Les Clous - Despite looking a bit dark, I thought that this was remarkably fresh, with pretty, round fruit, hints of citrus and some lovely white floral tones. Not on the same level as the Bouchard and Coche, but a really nice drink that kept getting better with time in the decanter.   1999 Salon Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut - Citrus, flowers, brioche, yellow fruits, great minerality and fantastic precision. Really effervescent and electric. This was a total crowd pleaser.      2004 Domaine Amiot Guy et Fils Montrachet - I think this may have been premoxed :-(. If not totally gone, it definitely was showing overly honeyed. A shame, because you could see potential under the oxidation.  2006 Domaine Denis Bachelet Charmes-Chambertin Vielles Vignes - Apparently the multiple half full bottles lying around weren't enough, so Fu grabbed this out of my cellar at the end of the night. Really awesome perfumed nose of strawberry and flowers. One of the noses of the night for me. On the palate this was round and supple, but also with a bit of crunchiness to the fruit that really made the texture interesting. Great wine.  2001 Bernard Dugat-Py Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru Petite Chapelle - Unfortunately at this point in the night my palate was a bit shot, but I recall this being a very nice drink.   2010 Finca Allende Rioja Martires - Served blind, I thought this was a New World chardonnay. Nope, it was modern-style white Rioja!  1960 Fonseca Porto Vintage - Raisins, dark toffee, and some spice. A nice way to cap the night."
wine,346tw2,Nucleus_Lockbox,4,Tue Apr 28 19:36:27 2015 UTC,"Always a great way to celebrate a birthday! Glad I had the chance to make it out to LA for this and catch up with everyone! I haven't had the time to write formal notes yet, but here are my thoughts.  1990 Dujac Echezeaux was my clear WOTN. Such an intense perfume of stemmy spice, florals, and earth with an elegant, fully resolved, savory palate. Just beautiful and so pretty.   2010 DRC Ech showed tons of potential and was surprisingly open all night. Incredibly spicy with great intensity.  2006 DRC RSV on the other hand was fairly closed as expected. Really pretty nose and the palate even started to show some promise after a few hours in the decanter. This had a great weightless, silky texture.  1986 Roumier Ruchottes was ultra-lightweight but quite lithe with a nice floral nose  2002 Bouchard Monty showed as excellently as last year with intense mint on the nose and superb balance of mid-palate density and acidity. Just really complete and precise white Burg.  1996 Coche Dury 1er Caillerets offered typical Coche aromatics and intensity. Probably tied with the Bouchard for best white.   2004 Amiot Monty was premoxed. Some argued it was merely advanced, but the strong oxidative notes made this no fun to drink. :(  1997 Leroy Beaux Monts had one of the best noses of the night, but was disjointed on the palate.  2006 Bachelet Charmes-Chambertin was summarily ripped from its place in the cellar late in the night (the earthquake safety zip-tie was no match for Charlie). Incredibly young, but offered super crunchy, crystalline red berry fruit with a great primary nose. Should be special in 20 years!"

Tarara is doing some great things with weirder stuff like Petit Manseng.  The best Virginia wine I've had, though, has been 2006 Breaux Merlot, which is a dense, structured wine a la St. Emilion.  Cedar Creek makes a fantastic Cab Franc.

If you have a non chain wine shop near you look there. Just ask what they recommend. With 260+ wineries in the state it's hard to know what they might carry.   I'm on my phone so I won't go to far into the varietals. The state grape is Viognier, which confuses me. Norton was a grape developed here. Dr. Norton never wrote down what parent vines he used to create it. It's a very distinct red. Chrysalis is a big producer of it and you should be able to find it in stores. We also have a lot of Cab Franc here. If you like a peppery wine you should love it. You also find a lot of Chambourcin being produced. The flavor profile can change immensely from place to place. One will offer a jammy wine while the place down the road has one that's spicy. I'm a huge fan of Petit Verdot as a single varietal that many places produce i this area. Then there are the fruit wines or fruit blends. You can find some decently complex fruit blends so don't write them off right away.   As far as what wineries to visit just hit me up when you want to are planning a trip. I've been to almost all of them in this area (NOVA) and a more than a few south of here."

wine,348d68,Sparkle_Chimp,2,Wed Apr 29 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"Virginia loves its Cab Francs, though many aren't that great in my opinion. I'd say the 'classic' Virginia grape is the Norton. I've heard some wineries (especially near Charlottesville) say that Massa Jefferson cultivated it himself, but I believe it came a little later.  Also, I would agree with the other posts here -- the Charlottesville/Albemarle area is likely your best bet to do some tastings, and you can take beautiful Skyline Drive through the Shenandoah National Park to get there! There are also some good places to the west of you, sort of along I-66."

Go high enough up in the mountains and you will even find some Pinot noir and pretty good sparkling stuff."
wine,348d68,uphillemu,2,Wed Apr 29 14:00:17 2015 UTC,"Linden vineyards. Jim Law built the framework for serious wine in Virginia. Do their cellar tasting.  $25 well spent. Maybe not available at whole foods, but local wine shops should have it. Their ""hard scrabble chardonnay"" is an amazingly crisp, focused old world style wine.  RdV is making a serious run at making world class Bordeaux style wines. If you can put out $50 for their tour and tasting you should. They self distribute and are already collector wines so you'll need to actually visit their winery to pick anything up... and expect to pay for it. It's not cheap.  They are a relatively new winery though so picking some bottles up from their first vintages could be a long term investment."
wine,348d68,uphillemu,1 point,Fri May 1 05:52:15 2015 UTC,"Also forgot the answer to your main question...   Single varietal cab franc is popular and fun. You won't find many regions in the  world (any?) doing single varietal petit verdot, but you see quite a bit in VA. I think I like Virginia viognier better than any other region it's produced. It seems to have more freshness/acid in VA.  I've had some decent hybrids out there as well. There seems to be a lot of chambourcin and seyval blanc. Hume used to do good versions of both, but I dont think they make wine anymore. Another winery buys their grapes and bottles under the Hume label so I can't speak to quality. I think they stopped making their own in 2013."

It can be misleading, though, because even though it might be vinted in Napa, doesn't mean that's where the fruit comes from. The majority of the bargain wines from California get their fruit from the Central Valley because it's a very good place to grow produce. But because it has such a warm climate, the grapes get very ripe, and the wines tend to be extremely fruit forward and low-acid."

The functions of wine buying, restaurant sales, and wine service came first; all my theory and the courts deductive tasting method were learned later.   I was in a tasting group with Master Robert Jones at 9 am today. I would recommend tasting with a master or advanced Somm if at all possible--his depth of knowledge on deduction from sight alone was incredible.   At this point, I am wait listed for the 2017 advanced course and examination. But my knowledge has increased so much simply by tasting with others--my tasting group now includes 4 certified Somms, and when we started there was only one. The group tastings certainly helped me pass the level 2 exam--and 14 years of floor experience has helped as well!  TL, DR; get a tasting group together and study your theory everyday.

wine,346pzp,digne94,3,Wed Apr 29 01:14:58 2015 UTC,"The best way: either be in a position as a wine buyer to sell yourself bottles at cost, or get a group together and split the cost of more expensive bottles. Even better, find a tasting group with at least one person who has access to wines wholesale and buy (and taste) the classics; left and right bank Bordeaux, NZ sauv Blanc, S Australian Shiraz, Napa cab, Mosel Riesling, etc."
wine,346pzp,burnsbrightest,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:59:08 2015 UTC,Congratulations! That is probably the level I'll end up going to. What was the test like? How much theory studying did you have to do? How did you practice for the tasting portion?
wine,346pzp,burnsbrightest,3,Wed Apr 29 04:09:44 2015 UTC,"What was the test like? I'm sworn to secrecy. But it has 3 parts: tasting, theory, practical. Since I'm a wine buyer procuring samples to taste blind wasn't an issue; studying theory in all my free time (the guild Somm text, Karen MacNeill's the Wine Bible, and Kevin Zralys windows on the world helped me most) was hard. The service exam was harrowing for my friends who work in sales/management, but if you work in service on a daily basis it's where you have your chance to show off to the masters.  A tasting group--even made up of amateurs--is a solid tool in learning the courts deductive method. If you can couple the deductive method with theory, ie ""the rim variation on this red wine transitions from ruby to red, indicating red fruit, indicating higher acid, indicating moderate/cool climate, allowing me to eliminate certain countries/regions"" you are golden. If you're like me and freeze up, having experience tasting the archetypal wines of the world is an immense help. Practice practice practice! Don't be afraid of doing service wrong or giving wrong tasting notes in your groups. And if you're going to go wrong on your exam, go bold and back up your answers with amazing tasting notes and you'll come out alright."

But the advanced has cost me a lot of money so far and if I had to add up the dollars, I'd say it's probably not worth it on face value. I think you need to really make the call on your own.

To grossly over-simplify: Cool climate (e.g., Northern Rhone, Washington State) wines tend toward a lean and savory style. Warm climate wines (Australia, Southern Rhone) can be quite big, with lots of dark fruit character. And I'm sure there are wines from each region mentioned that aren't ""typical"" even on this simple basis. I like Eric Texier's ""Brezeme"" which sort of splits the difference between Northern and Southern Rhone styles. It's 100% syrah, and available in the U.S. for around $20.  As for Malbec, being a Francophile and an old fart, I'd look for Clos La Coutale from Cahors, the original home of the Malbec grape. It's less than $20, and unlike the Cahors of old, you can drink it with pleasure even when it's only two or three years old.   As for Argentine Malbec, there are so many to choose from--salliegardner's post mentions three good ones.

wine,3459cb,nmott,6,Tue Apr 28 12:18:13 2015 UTC,"That will vary from taster to taster. A big part of wine for a lot of people is the ""sense of place"", that you should be able to detect the particular features of terroir and variety. A Chardonnay from Burgundy, from the Cote de Beaune, from Chassagne-Montrachet, from the vineyard Les Chaumes, should have detectable differences from La Boudriotte, right next door. It should taste different than a Chardonnay from Jura. It should taste different from a Chardonnay from Sonoma County. If your winemaking obscures those distinctions, you're hiding what makes that wine unique.   On the other hand, some people just want the wine to taste good and present a good value for the money.   There's value to both approaches."
wine,3459cb,OMGBADBEATZLOL,3,Tue Apr 28 15:39:30 2015 UTC,"If varietal context didn't matter, we could just label everything ""table wine"" and be done with it. Varietal character is significant to the wine's producer. Every bottle is a chance for he or she to showcase the ability of the grape grower and the winemaker. For a quick instance, Sauv Blanc. French winemakers suppress the tropical fruit flavors and choose not to oak to showcase the austere clarity that can exist in a variety. Many California winemakers will oak SB to round out the acid and provide a spiced nose and palate. New Zealand winemakers with leave the fruit notes unsuppressed, but still pure, to allow for a completely unmistakable bouquet that you can smell across a room.   So on that note, what does varietal typicity matter? When you're a casual drinker, perhaps not much. Drink what you like, like what you drink. As we drink more and begin to understand the wine world at large (which, in my opinion, is where the real fun comes in) varietal typicity helps us to understand what's going on. What does that part of the world like to drink? What are some challenges faced by that region? What is the distinct mark of the land, and how it is expressed in this wine? Typicity gives us a baseline to move forward  and further understand this big and exciting world of wine."
wine,3459cb,candyman49,6,Tue Apr 28 18:57:50 2015 UTC,Are they really dinged?  Are you overthinking this?  Plenty of syrahs that taste nothing like Northern Rhone have commercial success and critical acclaim.
wine,3459cb,CondorKhan,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:09:19 2015 UTC,"I don't hear of many wines that aren't inevitably compared to another region. Perhaps they aren't dinged, but it certainly seems like they're compared to the ideal of another region's grapes instead of being met on their own terms. Maybe a better question is: How useful are these comparisons to the average wine drinker, winemaker, or distributor?  I don't think so, but then I'm not in the best position to know ;) It's not like this makes a huge difference to me -- I try to take wines as they are, not on some preconceived notion of what it'll be like -- but I was curious to know how important this is to others on this subreddit.  Syrah might have been a poor example. But have you honestly never heard of someone comparing a varietal wine to another place, and then being disappointed when that wine doesn't match expectations? (Burgundy with Pinot Noir, Alsace with Gewurtztraminer, etc.)"
wine,3459cb,CondorKhan,2,Tue Apr 28 15:06:03 2015 UTC,"You're probably correct as far as more niche grapes like Gewurz and Gruner, which are so heavily associated with a single region and a single style... Nebbiolo is probably another good example... you drink Nebbiolo from VA or wherever and you're always thinking how does this compare to Barolo?  But I think the Pinot for Cab drinkers style also has commercial success and critical acceptance. My biased opinion is that true Pinot is made in a restrained Burgundian style, but the popularity of Meiomi and their ilk suggests that my opinion doesn't matter."

To answer your question - to me varietal typicity is not important, but if youre a winemaker and going to put some sort of extreme influence into your wine that you are labeling by varietal, its probably fair to tell the consumer what your process was and/or what to expect in the aromas and flavors on the label."
wine,3459cb,Le_Grand_Fromage,0,Tue Apr 28 13:37:43 2015 UTC,"I think the suggestion of putting aromas and flavors on the label, especially with the current system we have in the United States, is spot on. It drives me nuts when that information isn't included, especially since there's so much variation between different wines."
wine,3459cb,CondorKhan,5,Tue Apr 28 15:07:45 2015 UTC,Really? Often it comes off to me as being incredibly cheap.   When/if I read a back of the label tasting note it will almost always lower my perception of that wine.   Important to know your customer
wine,3459cb,CondorKhan,3,Tue Apr 28 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with the big cheese, it just makes wines look cheap.  But I do think there's a big problem with New World type of labeling. For example, if I buy Chablis, not only do I know that it's Chardonnay, but I know in what style it is made.   I'm terrified of buying California Chard blind because it can be made in just any style, from steely and crisp to a huge, flabby butter bomb.   There's really no easy solution to this."
wine,3459cb,hendricks_,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:48:03 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, why do you think it makes them look cheap?  And I'm right there with you on worrying about buying a wine blind -- especially Chardonnay -- because I don't know how it was produced. Apps like Delectable can help with this, but this is part of the reason why I tend to stick with local wines. I've tried 'em, I've liked 'em, and I'm not gambling quite as much as I would with an unknown wine.  Yet I think it would be a shame for New World wines to be made in a specific style and named based on their region. So many places are experimenting with what does or doesn't work that it would be hard (impossible?) to try and impose any semblance of order on the chaos.  I like your takeaway. No easy questions, no easy solutions."

Through practice you'll get better at not only describing things, but smelling subtleties. And you'll build a huge library of scents in your head."
wine,3456m7,choco-early,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:11:02 2015 UTC,"There are some good free resources for this. Check out the free ""Learn"" section of Jancis Robinson's site, and the ""Essence of Wine"" section of Alder Yarrow's. Both offer good descriptions of the things you might smell or taste in various wines based on region and variety.  (Here are the links to those sections. I hate adding links via Markdown. http://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn http://www.vinography.com/archives/the_essence_of_wine/ )  Another suggestion: Taste! If you have the opportunity, do it in a tasting room with knowledgeable staff. Ask questions. Do you smell a whole lot of vanilla? Welcome to American Oak. Does this Chardonnay have an interesting texture and smell a bit like butter? Ask if it was aged on its lees and/or went through malolactic fermentation.  It's all about drinking more, asking questions, and learning your own palate. Plus, you know, enjoying a mild buzz from all of the wine."
wine,3456m7,nmott,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:06:41 2015 UTC,"Don't try to mimic tasting notes that other people write or what you see in magazines.  Just describe what you smell, see and taste in your own words.   Practice and experience will hone your senses.  I've read notes where people say a wine tasted like burnt rocks.  I can't say that I know what a burnt rock tastes like but that doesn't make the note writer correct or incorrect.  In my opinion, it is more important to be able to truly identify flaws in a wine.  So many people pass off a corked wine as 'this is just bad wine' and never try it again instead of realizing that the bottle they tried is actually flawed and that the wine might actually be really good."

After a couple rounds of that you will probably be ready to write your own.  Keep going on there, and in time you will have yourself a nice, digitized wine note database.

wine,344tgd,tryit-earp,2,Tue Apr 28 08:39:57 2015 UTC,"Depends on the winery size and country. If its you're own winery started with your money you can be anything you want, as its you're winery. But if you plan to get hired as a winemaker by a larger company they sometimes have rules in place where winemakers are required to have some degree of tertiary education (could be chemistry, microbiology, etc). Also some countries care more about degrees than others (USA/Canada vs. Argentina/New Zealand).   What were you doing during the four vintages? have you had any experience working at a winery year round? There is quite a bit to wine making that happens outside the vintage schedule as you probably know, and in particular blending can be a huge component of a winemakers job. This sort of knowledge can only be gained on the job though, and so working as an assistant winemaker is usually a step most people have to take. Assistant winemaker is definitely possible without a degree and depending on your timeline and how long you've been out of school might be a better option for padding out your experience/knowledge than school."

wine,344tgd,Le_Grand_Fromage,1 point,Tue Apr 28 09:47:31 2015 UTC,You will only be hired as a winemaker if you start low and move up through a single winery or have developed some very close relationships within your network.

wine,3448kq,InsertUser487,3,Tue Apr 28 04:16:41 2015 UTC,"In my (very biased) experience as a wine lab tech with a background in genetics, chemistry is quite useful in a winery!  Larger wineries will want a more wine-specific degree in their techs and enologists, while smaller wineries may be willing to hire people with no science background at all. But every winery needs tests run.  Sulfur, alcohol, pH, acetic acid, sugar levels. Mostly quite simple, but interesting.  Viticulture, winemaking, and any other specialization will need more training but there's many paths to those jobs.  I'd recommend looking at a harvest internship.  There's a lot of grunt work to be done during harvest, and it's a great way to see what you think about the industry and if you want to commit to more education (and you don't want to be someone with a Master's and zero experience).  Also, it's super fun."

Having you background in biochemistry I would guess that you'll be surprised just how much of your background is applicable to wine making, as it is essentially just chemistry, tempered with palette and experience.  I know a few winemakers as well that have only a degree a in chemistry and they make amazing wines. So if you felt like it you could also look at that road one day!

wine,340soa,ILikeTheCoochie,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"You can make a balanced wine at that alcohol level,  believe me. Picking earlier for the sake of lower alcohol =//= better wine.

wine,340soa,HelenHuntsAss,0,Mon Apr 27 21:37:12 2015 UTC,"Climate change probably does play a part in this, but I tend to agree with you. Whenever I heard winemakers in California claim that they have no choice but to make 15+% wines because of the heat, It always makes me wonder how winemakers from the 19th and earlier 20th century seemed to have no problem making sub 14% red wines in California."
wine,340soa,brettyv82,0,Mon Apr 27 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"By picking earlier.  Anybody can pick early,  it is more a matter of making a good balanced wine.  You can make a balanced wine at 16% alcohol.  Hell,  I've had a Pinot Noir from Paso that was 16.4  on the label and it tasted decent and still had some lively acidity to it.  Right now low alcohol this and that is of the many buzzwords that your local Hipster sommelier is peddling to sell 5.5% abv Bullemic Pinot from Nebraska.    Believe me,  if the French and Italians had warmer weather for longer,  like California,  they would be making a similar style to what we make."
wine,340soa,HelenHuntsAss,2,Mon Apr 27 21:33:49 2015 UTC,"But so many of the wines in the range aren't balanced. They're over-extracted fruit bombs. And if that 16.4% Pinot had any ""lively acidity"" to it, the winemaker added tartaric acid, because the pH of grapes picked with that much sugar is very high. Plus when the ABV gets that high, you start to lose varietal character. I've also been to Paso, and I had plenty of 15-17% Zinfandels and Cabs that were just hot messes, with wine makers insisting they had no choice, but then I went to Caparone where they've been making 13.5% reds for 35 years in the exact same climate, so that argument doesn't hold water.  France and Italy both have regions that are warm enough to get really ripe grapes. The Southern Rhone puts out reds that sometimes push up to 15%, and even Piemonte in Northern Italy sees 14% Nebbiolo based wines. But I don't think that even if the whole country had a warm enough climate that they would make wine that way. Food and wine are inseparable in places like France and Italy, and high ABV, low acid wines just don't pair as well with food. Drinking wine by itself is more of a convention of the New World."
wine,340soa,brettyv82,2,Tue Apr 28 02:54:04 2015 UTC,I agree with you.   But to be fair they lie all the time about the abv in Europe.   I've had many wines from the south of France or Corsica known to be at 16 abv  with 14 written on the label.
wine,340soa,Le_Grand_Fromage,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:02:32 2015 UTC,"Good point! And I had heard that before. I was in Corsica 5 years ago, and wasn't particularly impressed with anything I tried there, but I knew precisely squat about wine in 2010, so my opinions from that era should certainly be taken with a grain of salt."
wine,340soa,brettyv82,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:50:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying fruit bombs don't exist,  they do,  what I'm saying is that it's possible to make a good,  well balanced wine at higher alcohols.  You don't start your wine out with ""I'm going to make a lean,  low alcohol X""  no,  if you want to FIND the varietal character of what you have planted,  your first couple of vintages you do phase picking,  some experiments with fermentation in separate lots,  and constant analysis. A good winemaker does this to some extent every vintage because it's how you can grow as a winemaker and finding out what your vineyard is doing. Doug Nalle,  for instance,  makes a lean,  pretty zinfandel from his dry creek Valley vineyard at like 12.5% on the bottle.  It's nice and it's pretty but you would say that his zinfandel falls outside of zinfandel varietal character is.  Really what his style does is gives his zin more longevity. About a year ago I had a magnum of Quivira zinfandel that he made back in 1988 when he was their winemaker that held up EXTREMELY well considering it was over a quarter century old.  I'm not saying it wasn't over the hump- it was,  but not nearly as much as I expected.  I'm guessing had I drunk that wine new,  it would have been far too acidic and undrinkable. That Pinot that I had from Paso  was drinking well young,  obviously not something to hold on to longer then six or so years, but what it did well was express the full bodied nature of the 777 clone.  You drank it and said ""oh yea,  that's a 777"".  However,  you might have guessed the alcohol to be at around 14%. Tartaric acid or not,  that's neither here nor there. Another example of a wine that shows its varietal character well at higher alcohol is Viognier.  Again,  I'm not saying that all Viognier needs to be picked at high ripeness,  but I have had many very well balanced Viogniers that were above 14%. I had one just the other night that was 14.8 on the bottle.  Would have fooled me. Viognier is a tricky one,  and not many people make it well. I had one that was at 12.5 that smelled like diesel fuel,  had zero mouthfeel,  it's acidity tasted like the winemaker was trying to make Sauvignon Blanc. Bleh.   Don't get me wrong I know there are plenty of wineries that are making over extracted fruit bombs.  Highway 29, cabs are all starting to taste the same. Someone brought over a bottle of cakebread cab the other night that tasted like mega purple. So much residual sugar that we remarked that it was ""Napa Auslese.""  I take issue with the fact that these buzz words in the wine world are so black and white.  A wine can be more balanced,  pair better with food,  and be more and interesting at a higher alcohol level than a lower alcohol level.  Sometimes.  Sometimes a wine can be more balanced pair better with food and be more interesting at a lower alcohol level.  Sometimes.  It all depends on the vineyard,  the varietal,  the vintage,  and the winemaker.  Broad brushing alcohols importance in how a wine tastes and pairs with food puts you in the same camp as the people that don't drink Merlot because they heard some mid-life crises baldy in a movie say it was bad."
wine,340soa,HelenHuntsAss,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:46:24 2015 UTC,"Fair points all around. I don't want to come across like I don't appreciate higher alcohol wines. Some of the best wines I have ever tasted have come out of California, and have certainly been over 14%. But it is true that wines from cooler climates (or grapes picked earlier) have better naturally occurring acidity, and acidity does make for good food pairing wine. That is not to say higher alcohol wines never pair well with food (high ABV wines can also be high in tannins, which bind to the proteins in meat and make for an excellent choice for steak,) or that lower alcohol wines are never good on their own (there is never a wrong time for a 12.5% Blanc de Noir.) Let's just agree that no one is a hipster simply for having a preference, whether it is with or against current trends."
wine,340soa,brettyv82,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:47:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about high ABV mostly being a reflection of picking decisions, but hanging grapes longer isn't always going to produce a balanced wine.

All the indications make it sound like it would be either unremarkable or downright vile, but I gave it a go and I'm pleased I did.  Even though it was topped with a crown cap and was a fairly heavy bottle, I was suprised to see it had so much carbonation. It poured bright pale ruby with fairly small and persistant bubbles. On the nose it had a very intense aroma of cherryade, fresh strawberries, bubblegum and violets with an unexpected note of game and barnyard funk. On the palate it is medium bodied, with low tannin, good acidity giving it freshness, a slight touch of minerality and a surprisingly long finish. I would hazard a guess that it underwent some carbonic maceration. The mousse was also very creamy. It kinda reminded me of a very funky, sparkling version of a beaujolais cru.  Overall I really enjoyed it and would consider buying it again. If I could say anything about this wine, it is that it is very loud and fun. Relatively fresh, I would guess this couldn't age much longer. However, it just has so much more attitude than you'd expect from a Grolleau from the Loire. I'm not sure if many people would share my sentiment however as it's very funky and tastes very much still alive and organic, but that's part of what makes it so interesting.  (Apologies the picture doesn't do much justice, was at the end of the bottle and doesn't show the verocity of the bubbles)"

If its small I can speak to that. Certain winemakers are very good at what they do and given the right space and time and weather they can produce beautiful wines. Wines that will go for 100s a bottle because with a certain name comes an assumption of a certain quality. There are good people out there that make niche wines but scarcity drives price.   Then you have small vineyards run by people with money who may our may not have any idea about wine. Look how many musicians own vineyards. I have personally worked with one of Dave Matthews vineyards and he has a female winemaker who is on top of her game. Fantastic wines, the tasting room is a bit ""hipster""and ask Dave does is pay the bills and paint the labels but they are good.   Then you have the people that don't know shit and want to be farmers/vintners. I could go on for days.  Every now and then you'll hit on a gem.

Sometimes it's a total bust, but every now and again you find a couple of gems and it's nice to be reminded of the romanticism of wine. Very few regions start up as money makers. A lot of them start up because they love wine and they want to share that with others.

wine,343ec4,ourmodelcitizen,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"Here in CA, and maybe elsewhere outside of Europe, there is a growing movement among young and up and coming winemakers who produce ""old world"" style wines - low alcohol, low oak, higher acid, terrior-focused wines. This is achieved in a variety of ways (i.e. Picking early, dry farming, high yields, whole bunch fermentation, etc..) but is definitely counter-culture to the traditional big, bold, powerful wines which dominated the past few decades here. Also you see a lot of grapes which have been long forgotten or written off to jug wine (at least in the states) now being featured by a lot of these places - grapes like Carignan, Counoise, Picpoul are just a few I see popping up more and more. Personally I dig it, but can see how these wineries can be considered ""Hipster"". Anything Jon Bonne is pushing right now will fall in line with this and I'm glad he is speaking up.

You should be able to get some great ones for $13 to $20.  Tasting Notes from Wine Searcher:  Everyday Valpolicella wine is a bright, tangy, fruity red with aromas of blueberries and banana, and the distinctive 'sour cherry' note found in so many northern Italian reds. It is as enjoyable at room temperature as it is slightly chilled, making it ideal as a refreshing red for warm summer afternoons. Montepulciano d'Abruzzo.  $15 will get you a decent one, $20 a little bit better one.  Tasting Notes from intowine:   The grape has a deep purple and ruby color to its juice. It has lower acidity (especially for an Italian varietal) and mild sweeter tannins. The resulting wines tend to be softer and more accessible than Chianti or Nebbiolo for example. Accordingly, the young wines are nice pleasurable reds that go as well with food as without it."

I find that once you reach the $50 or $60 threshold the wines become too structured & tight to really drink on release. While under $25 there's a certain formulaic generic up-front taste dominates (at least for reds).

wine,33yncd,oonniioonn,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:23:19 2015 UTC,"wat  That is a complete reversal of what they themselves have been saying for years. The reasoning, which I'm now having to get from Wikipedia because of this, is such:   While most wines can benefit from lying on their side, Champagne and other sparkling wines tend to age better if they are kept upright.[1][2] This is because the internal pressure caused by the trapped carbonic gas provides enough humidity and protection from oxygen.[1] The preference for upright storage of Champagne is shared by the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) who conducted an extensive study of Champagnes that were stored in various conditions and orientations. This study found that Champagne stored on its side aged more quickly because oxygen was allowed to seep in after the Champagne corks lost their elasticity due to contact with the moist wine.[9]"

wine,33uv73,CondorKhan,10,Sat Apr 25 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"So a few weeks ago, I complained that I had opened a completely premoxed bottle of 2005 Zind Humbrecht “Zind”. It seemed like in its prime, it would have been a very nice wine, so I proceeded to order a 2012 just to see what it would be like fresh.   Well, after trying the 2012, I’m not sure pronouncing the 2005 as premoxed was entirely fair or accurate… The 2012 is clearly fresh and in perfect shape, but it’s basically indistinguishable from Cotes du Jura. It seems to me, although it’s mentioned nowhere, not in notes nor in Zind Humbrecht’s website, that this is clearly an intentionally oxidative Chardonnay in the Jura style. So for the note:  2012 Zind-Humbrecht “Zind”. This is a blend of 65% Chardonnay and 35% Auxerrois from Clos Windsbuhl, one of the greatest sites in Alsace. Due to Chardonnay not being an approved noble grape of Alsace, this wine is labeled as Vin de France. Fermented in large oak foudres for over a year.  Pours pale golden yellow, clearly young. The aroma is the first thing that shocked me… exactly like that of a traditional Belgian gueuze like Boon or Hanssens. That toasty whiff of funk, if you’re familiar with the style. On the palate, citrus, apple, toast, barnyard funk and almonds. Finish is incredibly long, mineral and super acidic. Contrast with the 2005, which had absolutely no acid left. Closest wine I can think is Les Granges Paquenesses Cotes du Jura which I reviewed some time ago. Note how I kept mentioning Gueuze in there as well. Funnily enough, the night I opened it, I was debating between this bottle or a bottle of Boon. And being that I love both Gueuze and Cotes du Jura, I have no alternative but to pronounce this wine stellar.  Tried a couple of different pairings over the course of a couple of days. Thai food was a complete catastrophe. An omelette of duck eggs and portobello mushrooms with purple asparagus, however, was basically sublime."

For me, it was important to not look at it like a great tasting fruity drink and look at it for what it is. Wine.  Try to really figure out the different aspects of the flavor and mouthfeel. After that, it started to grow on me to where I really enjoyed the taste of wine.  Francis Coppola Merlot is also awesome for some strong fruity notes. As well as Robert mondavi miertage (spelling?)"
wine,33vytj,ModestBadass,3,Sun Apr 26 05:26:56 2015 UTC,"Here's a great way to find something you like: 1) Go to a good restaurant i.e. somewhere with a reserve list that makes you say, ""Why the fuck would i pay $100+ for a bottle of wine?"" 2) Sit at the bar, tell the bartender exactly what you wrote, and ask for a 3 glass flight of white wines and then a 3 glass flight of red wines. Each should cost you around $15. 3) Decide what you could drink more than a glass of. 4) Return at a later date or go to a good liquor store and ask for suggestions based off what you liked."

wine,33vytj,MasterofWhine,2,Sun Apr 26 06:49:08 2015 UTC,"Seems to be that the reds you have had so far must have been unbalanced and a bit big for you. I'd say stay away from Rhone and Bordeaux or anything Shiraz or Malbec until your palate is a bit more used to wine. There are many light reds out there that might suit you better. The most approchable styles would be:   Grenache for lighter and very fruit-intense. Look for Spanish Garnachas maybe. Pinot Noir from South Africa or Burgundy. Also SA Pinotage. Gamay from Beaujolais or Moulin-a-Vent (try them slightly chilled) Nebbiolo from Piedmont (more tannic, but more intense for cherries, spicy too) Cinsault reds, a few good but rare ones in France, quite a few in the US Mourvèdre reds, for example from Bandol And more. For more information on light reds, visit: Wine Folly on Light Reds   Lastly, I would recommend giving a few good rosés a try, as they are much lighter than reds but often have lovely acidity and fruityness. Why not try:   Cinsault/Grenache from Provence Tavel from Rhone (more earthy) Pinotage from South Africa And much more. For more information on rosé, visit: The Flying Winemaker on Rosés"
wine,33vytj,j_patrick_12,4,Sun Apr 26 09:34:36 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, a nice approachable Bandol. Nothing says ""mild, smooth, and fruity"" like faceripping tannins and light aromas of literal horseshit.   And I like Bandol."
wine,33vytj,MasterofWhine,1 point,Sun Apr 26 13:33:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think we have been drinking the same Bandol then, my friend. I had a Château Pibarnon 2008 just last week and the tannins were nothing short of soft and velvety. And try to get your hands on a Domaine de la Vivonne if you can and haven't, it may also change your perception. There is no shortage of fruits, and I can't fell the slightest hint of harsh tannins. I am not quite certain where you pick up the horseshit either."
wine,33vytj,j_patrick_12,2,Sun Apr 26 13:47:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sure one can find soft, fruit-forward Bandol. I just don't know if it's a great recommendation for a new drinker, because soft, fruit-forward Bandol isn't typical of the region. Mourvedre is a high-tannin grape by its nature (thick skin, etc.) and especially hot-temperature Mourvedre tends to develop ""gamey"" ""farmyard"" aromas (which is the polite wine critic way of saying it smells a little bit like dung.)   EDIT to clarify that hey maybe I'm totally wrong, but my experience with Bandol is in line with what I'm saying here, as are articles on the region that I found googling around to cross-check my memory before doubling down."
wine,33vytj,MasterofWhine,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:12:26 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see what you mean. I think maturiy may be playing a part in our disagreement. I seldom drink bandol over 6 or 7 years of age, bought directly from producers as it is in my vicinity, for the very reason that I like its fruit-forwardness. That's also why I go crazy for Mourvèdre rosés. I'd think that the Mourvèdre palate you are mentioning would be more common from Spanish Monastrell or older Bandol, which have formidable aging potential (Vivonne's vintages spread over several decades). I am not extremely familiar with these wines however and would need to taste a few before having an opinion on them. Thank you for your input, cheers!"

wine,33vytj,fox_mulder,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"First, to address the headaches, you may find this article helpful. I might also suggest drinking between 8-12 oz of water a little while before having the wine to help hydrate your body and prevent it from trying to hydrate via wine (which because of the alcohol content is more likely to act as a diuretic).  As to finding one to your tastes, I have seen some folks already recommended both Gamay and Pinot Noir, both of which I recommend to my customers entering the world of red wine. I also recommend a Garnacha (or Grenache) from Spain. That's a medium bodied, fruit forward wine that's relatively light on the tannins.  If none of those suit your fancy, you may want to look into a nice rose from Provence. They're absolutely beautiful wines."

In my experience, the wines that score between 88 and 91 on CT can be good, or even pretty good, but seldom am I ever blown away by those wines. In my own ratings - though I rarely give number scores anymore - mid to high 90s is reserved for only the most exceptional wines. If a solid/very good wine garners 93 points, you really are reducing the utility of the 100 point scale. I think that many people who care enough about wine to regularly rate wine on CT may take a similar view.   I also agree with what andtheodor said about favorite tasters being a useful metric. I do look at community averages though, and weigh them in context."
wine,33s40w,HornetAttack,4,Sat Apr 25 04:47:00 2015 UTC,"I think they just cluster around 88-91, plus it only takes one or two people to give a 70 to bring the average way down. Community averages are pretty useless but favorite tasters can carry some signal."

For one, when you see a published score from a professional critic, the score is more likely from one of the best scores given to the wine among possibly several professional scores, because this information is most likely reported to you - if you are a consumer -by an institution that has an interest in you buying the wine. There are certainly professional critics that score any given wine lower than the points advertised on the liquor shelves.  But I have seen nonsense on CT too like 92-point wines scoring 75s by somebody for being corked - enough to drag down most averages. Also, it may be possible the wines tasted and reviewed by professionals are more likely to be handled correctly before consumption."

Just have the retailer ship to your local facility (if FedEx, ship to a FedEx facility, if UPS, ship to a UPS facility) and sign the package out in person when you have the time. I've never had a retailer ship via USPS,  and I buy a lot of wine online, so I wouldn't worry about USPS policies."

wine,33qm6f,RoundersRob,2,Sat Apr 25 01:00:41 2015 UTC,"Nothing unfortunate about it. I am relatively new to wine and often buy based on labels, and honestly I am learning what kind of wines I do and do not like in a fun way. To me the labels tell a story, I will spend an hour in a market looking at wines reading labels deciding what to get. Some times it's a bust, sometimes I get an unexpected gem.  Now that I have learned more about wine and refined my palat a bit I do have wines that I like to keep stocked,but most my wine purchases are still impulses based on thinking a particular label was cool or had a good story. And because of that my wine drinking experience is exciting because I always am trying something new."
wine,33qm6f,cherlin,7,Sat Apr 25 23:35:35 2015 UTC,"I think that entirely depends on the consumer.  Everyone has different tastes, priorities, loyalties, and levels of knowledge.  It also would depend on why they're buying the wine (specific meal?  throw in the cellar?  gift?).    Pretty much any answer you're going to get would be speculation."
wine,33qm6f,theultrayik,3,Fri Apr 24 19:58:55 2015 UTC,"I don't consider myself a well educated wine geek or anything like that. I know the basics between old world and new world, the major regions and grape types, and generally good pairings.  What drives me is price followed by region/grapes. $10-$15 range and I'll buy a Malbec from Mendoza or Syrah/Grenache Cotes du Rhone. Sometimes I'll pick up California Zinfandels or bottles from Sonoma. Honestly, I can't tell you the specific importers, but I know a few key words to look for and generally recognize the labels for what I like. $20+ and I generally start looking for Bordeaux if I want old world, Napa valley if I want new. I can't pick out every fruit and signature taste like many of you, but I know when I'd prefer a cab vs. Merlot vs. zin vs. Pinot noir. I also quite enjoy Rioja Tempranillo.   I'm less well versed in whites, and really just stick with Rieslings (<$10 and I buy Chateau at Michelle and more than $10 I start looking from imports from Germany or France). I need to learn more about whites"
wine,33qm6f,Distance_Runner,2,Sat Apr 25 01:23:38 2015 UTC,"In our case, customers typically have a  price point and type (red, white, sparkling, etc) in mind. From there we usually ask weather they like full bodied, medium or light bodied wines. At this point they may give examples of grapes they like or say one of the options we list. Then we ask if they are pairing it with food and usually make recommendations from there. We may be a little different than your typical shop as our clientele is very open to recommendations and are very open to trying things they are unfamiliar with. From what I understand a lot of shops have a problem convincing customers to try wines other than the major and we'll known varietals."

wine,33p7je,clbarnes,2,Fri Apr 24 11:15:38 2015 UTC,"I've never been able to get into sherry. I've always been a big fan of fortified wine—port, madeira—along with oxidative wines—Jura, madeira—and appreciate dry, funky products along with huge sugar bombs in dessert form. So the allure of sherry is obvious to me: from a dry, oxidized Manzanilla to a gushingly sweet PX. And yet, it does absolutely nothing for me. Dry sherries end up tasting dull and without character, and PX is a sugar bomb with no sense of balance, no acidity. I've gone through 7 or 8 bottles now, searching for just one sherry to finally be I guess what I'm actually looking for, and it just never happens. Here's what inevitably happens:   Go to the liquor store, buy a new bottle of sherry more expensive than the last one, because I must just not be buying the right stuff 6 months later, wife tells me she needs sherry for some recipe Tell her she can use what's sitting in the corner She tells me she doesn't want to use my expensive stuff Think about it, think ""yeah that makes sense,"" then tell her to use it anyway because I'm never going to drink it.    I guess this just isn't a beverage for me."
wine,33p7je,adremeaux,2,Fri Apr 24 15:47:19 2015 UTC,I get it 100%. Love the stuff. But I can see why people don't get it. I went to a big Sherry tasting once and about half the attendants were totally put off.   I love the Amontillados and Palo Cortados especially. That's where my sweet spot is.
wine,33p7je,CondorKhan,2,Fri Apr 24 17:06:57 2015 UTC,"Amontillado is what is normally recommended when I ask people and explain my conundrum, so as such I've bought more of that than anything, but it's still the same story."
wine,33p7je,adremeaux,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:53:09 2015 UTC,"I'm also puzzled by a lot of dry sherry; I often get new car kind of off-gassing plastic and new shoe smells that I can't handle. I just bought a few Equipo Navazos Palomino and Manzanilla that are highly regarded so maybe my perception will improve.  There's plenty of flat, cloying PX but good vintage stuff like Toro Albala should have balancing acidity. Some VORS PX has been among the very best dessert wines I have tasted."
wine,33p7je,andtheodor,2,Fri Apr 24 16:53:57 2015 UTC,"Fresh manzanilla sherry is my favorite. The best ones have sell-by dates on them; after a year, they're still okay to drink, but they are no longer the same wine. As for the rest, I appreciate a great Amontillado, but it's not something I'd reach for on my own. I think it really is an acquired taste that I've just never acquired.   As for why so many wine-drinkers don't go for it, I can only repeat the only wine joke I've ever come up with: If you like it, it's oxidative, if you don't like it, it's oxidized. Well, not that much of a joke..."
wine,33p7je,winemule,2,Fri Apr 24 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"39 was a completely different liquid from the avg sherry. a wine i'd bring for winos. pleasant for the uninitiated, complex fruits, almonds, salt, balanced as in not crazy oxidated, original - very sweet nose and then you take a swig and wait a minute, wtf.  where did you buy them ?"

wine,33p7je,andtheodor,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:43:45 2015 UTC,they do have a crap load of navazos - but if you can get it cheaper....
wine,33p7je,redaniel,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"Manzanilla isn't really oxidized, quite the opposite, and much of the appeal is the intense freshness of the wine which had been protected from oxygen by the flor.  Some older wines, which may or may not be labeled manzanilla pasada, can have oxidative tones because the veil of flor is becoming weak.  Or, you might not be getting fresh bottles off the shelf.    Either way, I'm sorry you haven't found the one, yet.  Manzanilla was one of my eureka wines.  If there's a big difference between Sherry and the Jura and Madeira wines you mentioned, it's that those two have very high acidity while Sherry has relatively low acidity.  Hot region, and all...basically a sun baked desert.  They still have freshness and balance imo but they come about it in a different way.    I would recommend Lustau Puerto Fino, El Maestro Sierra Fino, and Valdespino Inocente, if you haven't tried those already.  I think they have a little more intensity or ""drive"" behind them.  And the really old sherries, which do in fact have high acidity (thanks to everything else evaporating).  PX, for example, has great acidity when it's older and is a really classy, wildly complex, velvety drink, but you're not going to get that from a standard bottle pulled off a shelf at an average store.    Thankfully, if you're near NYC, there's a Sherry Fest in a couple months."

wine,33kfbm,lordhuggington,9,Thu Apr 23 11:45:29 2015 UTC,Tool fans are exhausting and obnoxious at times. I'm an avid fan of his music and his wine. You try promoting your wine and have thousands of people only ask about your music and for pictures. Sounds pretty irritating to me.
wine,33kfbm,davidbowiedavidbowie,4,Thu Apr 23 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"Understood, but I've been to several of tastings with him with maybe a crowd of 40 people. Out of that number, maybe a handful knew who he was. Of those, they chatted him up about his wine.   I get that he's ""accosted"" by people who genuinely respects his music and pay money for his albums and his shows, but he's notorious for being a dick. That's his shtick even before Tool became the monster that it is. It just strikes me as different when you're there to try and buy his wines and he's still irritated. Who else in the wine world is like this?   I tried explaining this to my girlfriend, who didn't know who he was, who refused to believe he'd turn down a request like you were asking for his vital organs when there were so few people around. Well, she learned."
wine,33kfbm,lordhuggington,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:48:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I would use the word ""dick"".. He simply is a man who values his privacy in a completely un private business.  Imagine if every where you went there were many people who knew who you were and immediately had preconceived notions about you..  It would kinda suck. At least I would hate it.  He seems reserved and private and I respect that. I've listened to interviews where he talks about how places like LA drive him insane and being in a small town in Arizona where he is just another guy is valubule to him.  I just think he wants to be treated like a normal human being rather than as Maynard the guy from a massive rock band.  If I was in his position I would probably be doing the same thing."
wine,33kfbm,RyanBDawg,3,Fri Apr 24 10:32:59 2015 UTC,"I take it you're basing this on interviews and ""if I were in his shoes?"" My base is having interacted with the guy on a few occasions and having it in line with the experiences of friends.   Whether or not he wants to take a photo with someone doesn't inherently make him a ""dick,"" but his attitude and reasoning give off that impression. I'm actually a fan of his and I'd think that would give me more reason to give him the benefit of the doubt, but it's a sentiment common within the Tool community. It's accepted and people move on if not joke about it.   I understand privacy and being reserved, but it's simply not that black and white. He's not the Howard Hughes of metal. This guy pushes his wine routinely and personally at events all over the country. While that might help sales, we're talking events that may have a couple dozen people, wine people at that who aren't his musical demo."
wine,33kfbm,lordhuggington,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:37:50 2015 UTC,Maybe he was having a bad day when you met him or something.

So many former rock stars slap their names on a bottle of wine and call it a day, but it was so clear from this class/tasting tonight that Keenan is the real deal. He is active in the vineyard and in the cellar, and has an intimate relationship with everything he produces. There was no question anyone could throw at him tonight that he couldn't answer in a heartbeat, no matter how technical.  And the wines are good! He strives for an old world elegance that isn't always easy to find in the US, especially from warmer climates (although he insists the elevation of his vineyards makes for cooler climates that most of Central California.)  The Caduceus wines were kinda pricey in the $50-$60 range for current vintages, but his wines from the Merkin vineyard were also pretty tasty, and were all under $30. We went home with a bottle of the Merkin Shinola Bianca, which is a blend of Malvasia Bianca and Moscato from New Mexico. It was light and peachy/apricoty with a creamy mouthfeel, although he says he uses no malo whatsoever.  If you get a chance to taste wines from Caduceus, I recommend doing so. The American Southwest is still very much under the radar, but I think it will have its day."

wine,33niew,NZ0,3,Thu Apr 23 23:32:44 2015 UTC,"A grape quality index is really difficult to make... for a lot of different reasons. And an index which combines a number of important metrics will always beat the hell out of a single metric.  The best research for you to read would be on pricing programs for co-ops and other large operations with many growers. They have the same problem of defining grape quality at the crush pad. For them they need to pay grower bonuses then and there and also define the wine program depending on the perceived quality.  There are lots of metrics you can use, the problem is that rapid analysis is difficult. Do you actually mean every individual grape?... like optical sorting...  You need to explain your project a little more to get any meaningful feedback. Are you trying to sort spatially in the field, at the truck, crush pad, at a table, in line on the way to tank.... You will use a different analysis depending on where you are splitting lots, and what type of data you are able to collect. Lots of cool quality indicators if you can fire up a GC/MS or HPLC- but these aren't rapid methods. Custom made FTIR (wine-scan) programs are the best for rapid analysis. These aren't open source and take a number of years of robust data inputs to successfully create. machine learning is cool.  All that said, any data you can collect spatially is king. Better to define picking lots based on the chosen metric(s) rather than sort it off the truck. Like everything else in wine, it is best done in the vineyard.  Sorry, I'm sure that wasn't very clear."
wine,33niew,Le_Grand_Fromage,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:53:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the direction re: pricing programs.  I do mean every grape, not necessarily optical sorting, there may be more appropriate ways to measure the attribute, depending what it is.  The logical place, I feel, for a sorter like this to go would be after a destemmer before the manual sorting table. Our approach at this stage is to use traditional wet chemistry to relate the attributes to measurements that can be taken rapidly, like IR as you say. We have a lab and I have a couple of lab lackeys at my disposal so collecting data over a number of years is not out of the question, its something we have done for other crops and have started for grapes.  An interesting point you make at the end, how would you say a sorter would have an advantage by doing this kind of streaming in the vineyard?"
wine,33niew,winemakerpete,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:26:25 2015 UTC,"I get what you are after, I would only add that it would be far easier to approach the problem this way: Focus on what to reject rather than what to accept.

Berkeley rules, but still very expensive (upwards of $2500 for a 1bedroom apartment) and Oakland has a bunch of great little pockets along with some glaring flaws. San Diego isn't much cheaper but it's an amazing place with enough to keep you occupied for a long time, but still a step below SF in options and proximity to wine country (pretty much everywhere is). Wine is very much a part of San Francisco life, and it's not uncommon for the average person to belong to a few Napa or Sonoma wine clubs.

You are also a day trip away from Sonoma, Napa, and pasa Robles.

wine,33lr1n,jsmaster99,3,Thu Apr 23 15:34:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that many laws regarding the importing and selling alcoholic beverages in the United States are archaic, and no longer serve their purpose. And perhaps the industry shouldn't be so focused on the status quo and accept that the industry may need to change.  However, I think that the wholesaler side of business provide a lot of services to all sides of the business - to the producers, to the retail shops and restaurants, as well as to the consumer. For instance, wholesalers are often responsible for so many of the logistics, marketing, brand building, managing markets etc that would be so hard for retailers or producers to maintain. I don't think that they are just middlemen because the status quo says there needs to be middlemen and they get to make a profit.   I could go into a lot more, but was hoping to hear from some wholesalers?"
wine,33lr1n,heavyhandedpour,2,Thu Apr 23 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head.  Wholesalers provide a level of service that allows wine retail to properly serve customers.  If you didn't have wholesalers coming in, how many small wine shops could afford to hold their own regular tastings?  How many would have a proper set of promotional materials?  My guess is that a lot of smaller wine shops simply wouldn't be able to hold a nice product mix, and they'd have to carry more ""big sellers."" We'd see something more akin to the selection at Target.  I know the tiered system seems counter intuitive, but it prevents wine retail from becoming a cost-cutting, plonk-pushing race to the bottom."
wine,33lr1n,theultrayik,2,Thu Apr 23 18:18:03 2015 UTC,"I am a salesman for a wholesaler. The term ""middleman"" has become a derogatory tag, and not without reason. But wine wholesalers exist for a reason, and that is to absorb inventory from suppliers and then move it on to retailers. This is a tangible service, and it has value to both producers and retailers. As long as actual, physical wine shops and restaurants continue to exist, the world will need wholesalers. Wine is not software. It is tangible stuff, from specific places around the planet. Which is why I don't understand why wholesalers are so defensive. We really don't need monopoly power to continue existing. We actually add value. Even new developments like SevenFifty still depend on the participation of the wholesaler. If wholesalers really believe in free markets, then the three tier system should stand or fall on its own merits, and not by law. I really do believe that the world of wine is so large, and so various, and safe from digital reproduction, that wholesalers should not need legal protection to operate profitably."

wine,33hpge,Twerp129,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:05:15 2015 UTC,We're in Michigan so we have a tough time really ripening reds some years. We participated in an experiment with our grower to try this style with some semi-ripe Cab Franc grapes picked near the end of harvest. It'll be fun to see how it turns out!
wine,33hpge,nmott,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:17:04 2015 UTC,"Why does Michigan try to ripen these big reds when aromatic Alsatian whites and Austrian varietals seem to do exceptionally well there?  Is it a product of demand from the Michigan consumer? It seems like acid retention seems to be a big problem, how do you deal with this and still achieve ripe fruit?"
wine,33hpge,Twerp129,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:17:54 2015 UTC,"Well first off our little experiment is far from the norm. Michigan focuses on varietals like Pinot Noir, Gamay Noir, and Cabernet Franc primarily for their vinifera reds. These are classically light bodied grapes that exemplify the fruit forward reds Michigan strives for. Whites are the main focus on Michigan production. Red vinifera varietals are not common here."
wine,33hpge,snugglebuttt,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:11:17 2015 UTC,"My impression is that Michigan has a similar climate to the Finger Lakes, and I believe both are currently experimenting to see what works and what doesn't. Sometimes this is great -- Red Tail Ridge's Teroldego is amazing! -- and sometimes it's less wonderful, like when you try a Cabernet Sauvignon grown during a bad year like 2011.  I don't think experimentation in small regions is something to be chided. Aromatic whites work in cool climates. Great! Any winery that doesn't play into those strengths better have a good reason. But damn, why not see if some red grape varieties can do well, too?"
wine,33hpge,snugglebuttt,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"I've had some good reds from Wyncroft, but it seems only certain vintages obtain physiological ripeness. I've tasted a fair bit in Michigan, but I don't have the perspective from the back end.  When I taste in MI I'm constantly thinking, what if this was picked a brix or two less, but with a bit more more acid? It's such an interesting region, I'd love to see some winery go the opposite route and pick at lower sugars for a more high-toned structure.  Either way, keep up the good work. It's great to see the rapid changes in the local industry!  Edit: Ohhh, and some methode sparkling! This should Michigan's MO, the state needs about a dozen more Mawbys!"
wine,33hpge,HelenHuntsAss,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:02:03 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't picking them at a lower brix increase the problem of them not reaching physiological ripeness? My understanding is that usually they're determined brix-ripe before they're physiologically ripe.  And it's funny that you mention needing more sparkling wines. A lot of critics -- and a fair number of producers -- out here have said the same. I expect to see a lot more methode champenoise, pet-nat, and ""Well, we have a carbonator..."" wines in the next couple of years."
wine,33hpge,snugglebuttt,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:17:28 2015 UTC,"Physiological ripeness can be a somewhat broad target depending on climate. Generally speaking, early picks have more acid and savory aromatics at the cost of alcohol, potentially high acid, and undeveloped flavor. Riper picks exhibit more fruit, less acid, and higher alcohols. The risks with this approach are weather excessive alcohols and flabby acid."

I am not sure what I was supposed to look for with this one but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I never had an Italian wine before and may have to consider buying more Barolos in the future. I do want to say that my notes were influenced a bit by food, so keep that in mind.  Terra da Vino Essenze Barolo (2005)  Barolo, Piedmont, Italy, 100% Nebbiolo, 14% alcohol  Nose: blackberry, cherry and plum fruits, spearmint and confectionery sugar, licorice, rosemary and a1 steak sauce, leather and tire rubber, cardamom and nutmeg, rice pudding, grenadine  Taste: similar dark fruits in the nose followed by creamy root beer, baking spices, menthol and balsamic vinegar; dry, medium acidity and heavy body that is a bit grippy on the palate, but very easy to swallow as the tannin has been tamed by the age  Finish: medium length of creamy oak and dessert spices, cocoa, dark fruit compote, mint, butter pecan  Overall: Outstanding stuff. Rich and complex dark fruit nose with some rubbery funk and old time soda shop flavors. Reminds me a lot of a Zinfandel, which I love. It was a bit grippy and vinegary on the palate but nothing too overwhelming. The tannin was smoothed out towards the back of the palate, making this very easy to drink. A fantastic finish.

wine,33jafp,jake40509,2,Wed Apr 22 23:40:20 2015 UTC,"The vacuvin system works fairly well.   I see about 5 days or so using it with the wine sitting on the counter.   This is probably helped though because it won't stay open for long though, so less exposure.   Could probably get more time in a fridge as well."
wine,33jafp,dunno260,3,Thu Apr 23 12:49:16 2015 UTC,"I recommend buying a bottle of Private Preserve. It is an aerosol can of inert gas that you spray into your bottle. It displaces oxygen and helps opened wines last longer.  Until you get that, storing in the fridge is probably best. Just pull it out 15-30 minutes before you plan to drink it again."
wine,33jafp,Muppet_Mower,2,Thu Apr 23 00:33:06 2015 UTC,"Private Preserve is what I use and it works fantastically. A bottle is good for about a week, usually.

wine,33jafp,winemakerpete,2,Thu Apr 23 00:37:29 2015 UTC,"Private Preserve is the best option, but barring that just put the cork back in and leave it on the counter, not the fridge!  The fridge preserves food by inhibiting microbiological growth (ever heard of the 40/140 rule?) however microbes are not responsible for the wine spoiling (usually) after you open it, oxygen is. The wine ""opens up"" from exposure to Oxygen (think decanting) but then eventually dies from the exposure. Oxygen is actually more soluble in liquids at colder temperatures so putting the wine in the fridge overnight just accelerates it's death. Private Preserve works by displacing the oxygen in the bottle with compressed inert gasses like CO2, nitrogen, and argon. It does work well, but I don't find it necessary. A well made red wine that is not aged long can often survive a day, sometimes 2 or 3 with the cork being promptly reinserted after pouring a glass. I like to open a bottle, have a glass or two and then try it the next day after it sits on the counter. Often times I prefer it on day two."

For example: growers in Montalcino will, if permitted, first choose to classify their wines as Brunello di Montalcino. If they can't make that level, then there's Rosso di Montalcino. After that, Sant'Antimo Rosso, and then maybe IGT Toscana. Only after all these other possibilities have been excluded will they use DOCG Chianti.

wine,33dq41,snugglebuttt,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:31:11 2015 UTC,They get cleaned of any leftover wine/lees or whatever and then the barrel is gasses with sulfur dioxide gas to prevent any growth of anything bad and then bunged and stored in our barrel room that is temp and humidity controlled.
wine,33dq41,snugglebuttt,2,Tue Apr 21 23:48:52 2015 UTC,You gotta knock those things up mate.
wine,33dq41,snugglebuttt,2,Wed Apr 22 01:41:17 2015 UTC,"So how long does it take to do one barrel? How much will the wine be exposed to air?   You mention that you're removing the lees completely but also that the client doesn't want filtering, how does that work? I imagine that there's a little floating around even if it's quite settled.  Could you describe the process a little? I've seen pictures, but I don't have any practical knowledge. Where is the wine while you're cleaning the barrel? How exactly do you get the lees out? Does the wine go back in the same barrel always? I assume you have to top off the barrel after removing lees--does that mean there are a few empty barrels at the end after filling others?"
wine,33dq41,snugglebuttt,4,Tue Apr 21 19:49:35 2015 UTC,I'll explain the whole process. Let me know if I don't answer all of your questions. I'm on mobile. 1st step is to lay out all the barrels. I then clean a pump and hoses and a special designed barrel wand that allows me to suck out the wine from the bottom of the barrel. Lees settles at the bottom so the barrel wand has a small adjustable stainless steel rod that puts the the inlet above the lees. I suck out the wine from the barrel into a stainless steel holding tank. Once the barrels are empty they get flipped over and I use a barrel cleaner that gets put into the bung hole and when water pressure is applied the tip spins. Cleaning the barrel. After they are cleaned and drop dried I flip them back over and fill them. There is a bit of oxygen exposure but it is necessary. And I will have either empty or partial barrels at the end.   It is almost impossible to completely rack off all the lees. Some winemakers want that as long as there aren't too many solids in the wine. It gives the wine a heavier taste and feel. If the winemaker doesn't want that the wine can be filltered. We filter a lot of our wines.
wine,33dq41,scuba_davis,2,Tue Apr 21 20:08:15 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, thanks!  Is there any sulfur involved or some other resterilization before putting the wine back?  I imagine there's a fair amount of juice in the lees--is that just thrown out? Could you press it somehow? Also, do you compost the lees or what happens to it?"
wine,33dq41,Young_Zaphod,2,Tue Apr 21 22:22:48 2015 UTC,Yes there is sulfur involve. I do a test on the wine to determine how much unbinded sulfur dioxide is in the wine. Depending on how many parts per million there are I will adjust it. (Usually to 30ppm)  There usually is some wine left in the lees. The lees can't be pressed it is much too thick. I could put it into another container and let it settle out again and get what I can from it that way but it's not worth my time.   The lees is just rinsed down the drain to our waste water system which makes it safe and environmentally friendly. Then it gets pumped into the field next to our winery.
wine,33dq41,Young_Zaphod,2,Tue Apr 21 22:42:02 2015 UTC,Really interesting!  Do you do any other tests on the wine? Residual sugar? Alcohol? Other?  How are the barrels moved around prior to removing the lees? I assume you can't roll them around or stand them up because the lees would be disturbed?
wine,33dq41,Young_Zaphod,3,Tue Apr 21 22:52:21 2015 UTC,"We do as many tests as we can. Residual sugar, alcohol content, VA, and many more. The barrel are on barrel racks. There are two barrels on each rack and we pick the racks up with a forklift. When the barrels are stored. They are stacked 5 or 6 racks high"

wine,33dq41,Muppet_Mower,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:03:35 2015 UTC,No. It's just faster. It also allows me to push the wine back into the barrel after it's been racked. The downside to using a pump though is that it's a lot more rough on the wine.

wine,33dq41,Vitalstatistix,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"It is a wide range. We have so many different clients and they all buy different types. For these barrels there is a mix of boutes, ermitage, taransaud and marcel cadet. I believe all are medium- medium+ toast but they are older barrels. Most 2010 or 11. As for the totes we use ether nitrogen or aargon to gas the headspace to reduce oxygen contact. And all the barrels are French oak"
wine,33dq41,Vitalstatistix,2,Tue Apr 21 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"We do the same in our totes, but they just bleed Sulfur like none other. We really only use them for a few things and transfer though. Do you use a mix of new barrels to introduce new oak or alternative methods? Or are you just using the barrels as a Micro-Ox/aging method?"
wine,33dq41,megapurple,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:06:11 2015 UTC,Not the barrels have been used only once or twice before so they will still give off oak. Just not as much or as fast as a new barrel. Where do you work?
wine,33etp1,basaltgranite,9,Tue Apr 21 23:08:20 2015 UTC,"People drink with their eyes, and with pink wine's they are more likely to by something that is unique.  Think about the blue bottle craze from a couple of years ago.  As a for instance on this whole mess (I worked Corporate winemaking FYI), we started getting complaints about a certain bottling run of white wines and they kept coming but it was intermittent.  There was no lab difference, materials were the same, even the bottling line, then we figured out that the bottle itself was the same but from different manufacturers.  The difference ended up being the slight green tint of the ""good"" bottle being ""clean, refreshing, crisp"", the bad bottles had more of a brown tint and were described as ""old, aged, lacking in character""."
wine,33etp1,nathism,5,Wed Apr 22 04:53:25 2015 UTC,"This is an old practice in Provence, with several notable producers like Minuty and Ott that have been doing this for years, if not decades.  I cannot possibly know exactly why they do it, but I can speculate: Marketing. The Rosé market in France is huge, highly-competitive, and the season for it is very short. During the months of July and August, where nearly the entire country takes a holiday, these savvy producers have utilized unique packaging/glass to stand out, both on the shelf AND on the table-tops of outdoor cafes, etc.  Look out over a busy St. Tropez patio in the summer and you may quickly recognize several distinct bottle shapes, aside from the generic high-shouldered Bordeaux bottle. People order wines for various reasons, and one of them is that they like the packaging. The marketers have won.  As far as its effect on price, I would guess that with the quantities that these producers are buying that the cost differential is minimal. It could potentially come off the price, but it would probably harm the brand's overall recognition-factor on the table-top and on the shelf.   As far a ""lack of quality"" goes, I get where you're going, but it's hard to paint with such broad strokes in this regard. I'm sure there are some cheaper producers may be utilizing unique bottle shapes to cover-up their inferior wines in the minds of easily-influenced consumers. But in the two famous Provence producers I've mentioned (and I'm sure there are others but it's late and my brain isn't working) make very good examples of the category, and so you cannot just write off a wine simply because of its glass.  Like anywhere else, it's what's in the bottle that counts."
wine,33etp1,jaded76,2,Wed Apr 22 05:43:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Knowing that ""fun"" trademark glass has a context and history in South France for an ephemeral summertime sunshine product does make it look less like downmarket bling.

It's just that I would never get that feeling, almost jealousy, when a customers walks out with a great bottle thats perfect for their situation.

wine,33egj7,nmott,2,Tue Apr 21 21:27:28 2015 UTC,"I swear I won't do this for everything posted to that sub. But I figured Reddit could use something devoted to a specific region; and even if Reddit can't, I'd like to post somewhere besides Delectable. Win-win!  Original tasting notes:  This bottle was one of several kept in a cellar where a fair number of bottles were out-of-whack in some way once they were opened. Whether this is because of where the wines were purchased, how they were stored, or some other factor will likely remain a mystery.  Yet I wanted to start this subreddit off with this wine for a few reasons: it’s representative of the 2011 vintage; it’s a good indicator of Sheldrake Point’s general quality; and it’s hard to find someone who will argue that Cabernet Franc isn’t one of the region’s best red grapes.  But on to the wine. The 2011 vintage is the middle brother to the excellent 2010 and 2012 vintages in the Finger Lakes. Here’s what Wine Spectator said about the 2011 vintage:   Finger Lakes vintners were put to the test in 2011, as the region dealt with its most difficult growing season in recent memory. With heavy rains falling from mid-August through harvest, New York's upstate wine region struggled with disease pressures and uneven ripening that could result in a very inconsistent set of wines.   This shows in the 2011 Cabernet Franc I’ve tried. As opposed to the deep red fruits and plush mouthfeel of the 2010 and 2012 vintages, I notice more pine and tobacco flavors cut with a more stringent mouthfeel from the 2011 vintage. This wine is no different.  Sheldrake Point did what it does best — creating an accurate representation of the vintage without pushing people away. With the exception of their dessert wines, this is the hallmark of Sheldrake Point’s portfolio: rarely mind-blowing, just as rarely disappointing. Consistent, quaffable, and more bang-for-your-buck than some other wineries.  Would I buy this again? No. There are too many 2010 and 2012 Cabernet Francs available for me to choose something from the 2011 vintage. (I even prefer Bloomer Creek’s 2011 Vin d’Ete Cabernet Franc to this wine.) But I’m not upset that I bought this bottle."

wine,33c3vs,fairtonybeta,21,Tue Apr 21 09:03:43 2015 UTC,"Orange wine is the traditional wine of Georgia. Most certainly the oldest style of wine made in the world. This is the birthplace of vine cultivation after all.   Grapes go in to an amphora underground, in 6+ months you bottle the liquid. Wine comes to a sort of microbial and oxidative balance. They have been making wine like this for ~6000 years."
wine,33c3vs,Le_Grand_Fromage,4,Tue Apr 21 11:40:55 2015 UTC,"He's right. It's not a new category. It's just a winemaking technique. A friend of mine makes a skin-fermented SB in addition to a more traditional one. Abe Schoener is well-known for his experiments in that technique.  And no, it doesn't have to be fermented in a clay vessel.  The current orange wine fad won't last. They'll still be wine imported from Georgia or other places using that technique, or winemakers experimenting, but it's neither a new or different category, nor is it bound to soon be found in every wine store."
wine,33c3vs,arnaudh,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:18:20 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. The wines are scarce, they're expensive, and many of them require a very open mind when it comes to aroma and flavor. Here's a sample tasting note:  The nose offered a strong note of apricot, and also of camphor (“Vicks Vapo-Rub!” said one taster. We agreed.) There were floral notes and what our colleague Cara Freije called “vitamins.” The palate resists any kind of conventional description; there were some dark, spicy, fruity notes, and a whole lot of tannins.   Here's another:  “Of all the wines, this had the most vinegary quality; it reminded me of a gueuze [a style of Belgian lambic ale known for its dry, cidery, musty, sour, acetic/lactic acid flavors], and even looked like one—kind of cloudy. Did you ever eat a cantaloupe that was just past its prime? Still sweet, but with an extra funk to it? This had some of that, also.”   As always, YMMV."

Saša Radikon, son of Stanko, grandson of Franz Mikulus, explains: “In 1995 we started making white wines with lengthy periods of skin contact. This was a technique that my grandfather used because he wanted to preserve his wine for a whole year. Before my father started selling our wines, my grandfather would make wine for the whole family from our vines, but this was for personal consumption only and it had to last an entire year until the next vintage.”"

Tannin is technically an acid, and during the course of preserving a wine it will start to lengthen in it's molecular size. when a long chain of tannin becomes too long, it will precipitate as a solid, and BAM! you have Sediment. you're drinking a 1998 Gattinara. Gattinara DOCG is in Piedmont, and the grape is Spanna, which is just Nebbiolo. If you've ever had Barolo or Barbaresco, you'll know that Nebbiolo is Chemical Super Freak of Tannin; A traditionally made, young Barolo will literally return your tongue to you bound in electrical tape. (Yes I made a ""the Nebbiolo is assaulting your tongue"" reference with sex tape). Something with that much raw grape tannin helps it preserve over time. Nebbiolo is a thin skinned variety so its going to have medium minus concentration  (you can read a book through the wine) and it naturally has an orange tinge to the Rim of it Which will just intensify with time You sir had some good juice. For the future, if you know you're going to open something old.... lay it on it's side for a few days, and then gently decant it so you can leave all that crust in the bottle. Bobby Stuckey has a service video on Vimeo that will show you how to decant an older wine, so you can look like a complete stud to your lady. Good luck man  (you know it's coming...)

wine,33ayf7,ifeelhome,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:06:53 2015 UTC,"Hm. There are a lot of factors at hand here - it could be a wine that simply doesn't age well (some just don't hold up to extensive aging) it could be that your parent's wine cellar is sub-optimal, it could be that it was stored for too long at 72 (which is usually a bit warm for wine). But the taste is telling - if it tastes sour and ""off"" to you, it could very well be."
wine,338ify,readbetweenthelol,8,Mon Apr 20 14:26:38 2015 UTC,"Ok before we get too far into dialing you in, lt's consider structure in wine.  Acidity is sensed as making the mouth salivate. the quick answer is that when the wine enters the mouth, it alters the pH. The brain senses that this acid can remove the enamel from your teeth and ups the saliva production to restore pH and dilute the acid to keep your chompers in tact. Tannin on the other hand is a polyphenol that will actually tan leather (hence the name tannin). This guy reacts with proteins, so the proteins in your saliva are fair game. When this happens, it will actually remove moisture and your mouth is dried out. (with Merlot, you'll deal with more tannin) So in short, when your tongue sweats, that's acidity - When you feel like you put cotton balls in your mouth, that's Tannin.   There's a couple factors to consider with price. On the low end, money thrown towards a bottle of wine will actually make a difference cause you'll be paying for specific facets of wine making at that point. (Oak is damn expensive) Most Merlots in my opinion benefit amazingly from oak... so spending a touch more money will make the difference. Pinot Noir on the other hand; I don't think it's as dependant on the cooperage as say Cabernet and Merlot... but it does make a pretty interesting style when used judiciously.   So somewhere in the vein of the near $30 price point these are some labels I would look for;  Pinot Noir: Wind Gap, Claiborne & Churchill, Soter, Macphail, Peay, Penner Ash.  Old World: Domaine Pedrix, Latour, Drouhin (There's a lot of variance in burgundy depending on locale so it would depend on your taste. Learning burgundy is like drinking the ocean a cup at a time)    Merlot: Paradigm, Peju, Clos Pegase, JAQK Bone Dance, Duckhorn (textbook), Ehlers, Seven Hills, (if you want it real big) Swanson.  Old World: Château Lasségue, Château Bellevue (Look for St.-Emilion and/or Pomerol for good examples of Merlot based Blends out in Bordeaux)  Happy Carousing"

Time and storage conditions may be a factor. Also try decanting the wine. If you ordered a glass or had a tasting somewhere that bottle may have been open for awhile. If you eliminate those factors then maybe umm... well... you have a confused mouth.
wine,338ify,Owl_ist_Eule,5,Tue Apr 21 00:34:10 2015 UTC,"If your palate is not reacting well to high acidity, I would avoid pinot noir Willamette Valley or Burgundy for now. Those places are known for a leaner style of pinot noir, which translates into high acidity AND the decent ones are expensive to boot. Try pinots from Sonoma and merlots from Napa. You might even look into zinfandels from Paso Robles.   Consider how much you are spending at a restaurant (I'd guess $30-$40 a bottle or $6-$10 a glass) and half that in order to find some decent stuff at the wine store. Also, it would help to know which wineries you enjoyed and what bottles you bought at restaurants. Keep a list, and focus on those regions in your future experimentation.  Finally, drinking wine in restaurants can give a significantly different experience than drinking wine at home due to the food. Restaurant food is often rich and made for wine pairings - stuff that an average Tuesday night meal wouldn't really live up to. If you were eating rich food while drinking pinots and merlots in the past, this could vastly affect your perception of their acidity. Try roasting some salmon and sauteeing some mushrooms with butter next time you drink a pinot. That's always my favorite combo."

wine,338ify,Owl_ist_Eule,2,Mon Apr 20 15:04:28 2015 UTC,"On my smartphone, I keep a list in the notes app called ""Wines I Like"".  Then when I have a great wine at a restaurant, or at a friends house, I just open the app up, and take a photo of the lable.  Then, when I get a chance, I look the wines up on the internet for pricing or try to find them locally at a wine shop."
wine,338ify,ro4snow,2,Tue Apr 21 12:41:35 2015 UTC,"There's a great app called ""Delectable"" that has a function where you take a picture of the label, and the app will identify the wine and let you rate it based on a easy Happy Face system. Once the wine is identified, you can see what others have thought of it. You can also search wines by name. It works really well and is very useful."

wine,338ify,mcindathouse,2,Wed Apr 22 13:10:33 2015 UTC,Warmer climates often suffer from a lack of acidity in their grapes.  attempts to correct this are often obvious. Pinot Noir is the most expensive grape to grow that is commonly found so when looking for PN spend at least $20ish.
wine,338ify,deepfriedbutter,2,Tue Apr 21 15:29:52 2015 UTC,"I find both Willamette and Burgundy very hit and miss.  My suggestion is a bottle from Santa Maria Valley, CA:  Byron, Cambria are both large and make very consistent wines.  Or for about $30, a Melville Sta Rita Hills Pinot Noir.  If those wines still seem 'sour', try off dry reds that are blwoing up right now.  Cupcake, or anything labeled as 'soft red'."

Columbia Crest's estate Merlot is relatively inexpensive and approachable while their H3 (Horse Head Hills) Merlot is a little pricier but more interesting and complex.
wine,338ify,Define_It,2,Tue Apr 21 12:40:02 2015 UTC,"First thing that comes to mind is the delineation between acidity and tartness of the fruit coming through in your wines.   Acidity, as /u/CalmlyRaging5 mentioned, is a property of the structure of the wnewine, and not a 'taste.'   Tart fruit character is commonly found in Pinot Noir (especially grocery store and budget brands), and I often find thin, insipid Merlot to be defined by it whereas better Merlot wines have plush fruit flavors. I will echo others here in terms of a solution to seek out better Pinot, like ~$30-$40 bottles from the Russian River Valley or the Right Bank of Bordeaux. If you want a slightly cheaper option, meaty and 'riper' Pinots from New Zealand can often be had for ~$20-$25, although a little harder to find.   Try also looking for a Mencia Joven from the Bierzo region of Spain. They are friendly, lively wines suited for Pinot and Merlot drinkers looking for softer, fruit-driven wines, and they will almost never let you down with a too-tart palate.   Cheers!"

wine,338twr,winemule,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"agreed. weird that you have this job without much experience - not bad, just curious. You have a lot of research to do - if youre looking for just adjectives and are selling to experienced tasters, your customers will see right through that. start tasting wine and researching/learning as much as you can about the different types and regions. Wine For Dummies is actually a great resource. The World Atlas of Wine is essentially an encyclopedia for wine and wine regions. things like this - like i said, you have a lot of research to do. Good luck!"
wine,338twr,scuba_davis,4,Mon Apr 20 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation just over a year ago. I had been brewing and exploring beer for a bit, and my SO wanted to go to the wine/beer/homebrew store to pick out a bottle for her moms birthday. The owner approached me and offered me a job there, I was speechless and accepted. I had good experience with beer and brewing but had almost zero wine experience at that point and felt lost in the wine world. I now consider myself at least decent in selling wine. So here's my advice.  Read and watch: Start reading about wine, especially about the wine your drinking while reading. I love The Wine Bible because she breaks it down by region and varietal, discusses grapes in context of one another, and gives you a good basis for starting your exploration of wine. You pick up a lot of terms and bits of info that are easy to drop in conversation and build confidence in yourself and with your customers. Watch Somm to get an idea of the wine world. It follows a few people attempting to get their Somm certification and shows you how intense wine can be. Don't let it scare you, you don't have to know wine the way they do, but it will help build an interest in wine.  Talk: Talk with the people you work with who know wine, this helps immensely with picking up on wine lingo and terminology. It also helps build confidence when discussing and describing wine. That's the main point here: confidence. Customers know when you're not confident, and even if you aren't you'll get better at hiding it. But, don't lie. Don't ever lie because they're going to know if you tell them a white is acidic or jammy or bright and they try it only to find that it's not.  Drink more wine: I get the pleasure of tastings with our distributors and get to have a preview of wines before we are selling them. When a wine stands out during tasting and then it comes in to sell you have a lot less trouble describing that wine because it made an impact in your memory when you had it before. When I buy wine, I'm either buying something I really enjoy or something I'm completely unfamiliar with and reading about it while I drink it. Hell, I thought I didn't like whites, turns out I just don't like really acidic pinot grigio. Don't get caught assuming all wines that look similar on the labels are similar in the bottles.  Keep trying new wines, reading, watching, talking, listening. You'll get there. It might take some time, but you'll start hunting for new information and wines you aren't familiar with effortlessly. You'll find what you really enjoy and build confidence. It just takes time and effort.  Really hope this helps. Good luck and welcome to the community."

wine,338twr,NOLAWinosaur,2,Mon Apr 20 16:45:56 2015 UTC,I sell wine for a living in a face to face retail environment so can completely understand feeling overwhelmed by the large amount of information you need to absorb.

wine,336xzg,brokemedstudent,32,Mon Apr 20 02:49:20 2015 UTC,"Hey there, welcome to the wonderful world of Nebbiolo from Piemonte! Not sure how much you've researched, so pardon me if my information is too basic!  You've probably already realized that Barolo and Barbaresco are the most prized Nebbiolo producing zones in the Langhe. Both are incredibly prestigious and delicious wines, however Barolos are more notable and usually more expensive. The downside to these wines is they are typically very tannic and take years to age and settle in. Most people will tell you not to open a Barolo or Barbaresco for 10 years +. If you can't wait that long, decanting for an hour or two will do wonders.  Barbaresco is usually a little less expensive but a lot more consistent. If there's a $50 bottle of Barbaresco vs. a $50 bottle of Barolo, your odds of getting a better tasting wine lay with the Barbaresco. $30 buys you a very good bottle: Produttori del Barbaresco is a co-op that takes combined yields from the whole region and bottles a very consistent wine every year. I've never had a bad bottle and they age incredibly well.  Barolos are typically more expensive and can hit or miss (imho) – however, the most exciting wines I've ever tasted were Barolos. It's tough to get a decent bottle for less than $60. Pietro Rinaldi is a good bet, as is G.D. Vajra. Both will run you around $50.  If you're looking for some wines that are little more budget oriented, it's good to keep in mind that all of the top Barolo producers usually release standard bottles of Nebbiolo as well – these will typically be labelled as Langhe or Piemonte table wines and might sometimes be blended with some other local grapes. They won't have the barrel aging that Barolos and Barbarescos go through, but are often much more accessible at younger vintages. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the G.D. Vajra Langhe Rosso. All of that amazing Nebbiolo acid and structure from a great provider for about $15/bottle. I buy a case every few months and it's my go-to wine for dinner on weeknights.  Sorry for the ramble, hope this is helpful!"

wine,336xzg,smallerthanhiphop,3,Mon Apr 20 11:13:53 2015 UTC,"Great info!  I really like Ghemme DOCG and Carema DOC for Nebbiolo at a better price point than Barolo(typically). Both are more approachable earlier than Barolo. I think Ghemme can blend a small percentage of other varietals in with their rosso, but most producers tend to use almost all Nebbiolo."
wine,336xzg,Muppet_Mower,4,Mon Apr 20 14:50:53 2015 UTC,"Look for Langhe Nebbiolo from good producers. It's a wider appellation but still similarish in style.

Also Michele Chiarlo makes a Barbaresco which is pretty darn good and won't break the bank. If you're going to go Langhe Rosso, Vietti Perbacco I think actually out performs Vajra Langhe Rosso (And I used to champion the shit out Vajra on my list) Robbndahood, check it out. I love the Vajra, but the Perbacco is pretty killer.   As for Barolo; you're going to pay money. if youw ant some bang for your buck, I love the Renatto Ratti Marcenasco (single Cru Barolo) and it will not break the bank. Good Juice.   Be careful though, before you know it, you're going to trade in your Produttori Barbaresco for Giacosa-Asili/Gaja Sori Tilden.  Another cool random tidbit about Nebbiolo; it's a truly Aromatic Red Grape (it actually has Terpenes).  Happy Carousing!"

wine,336xzg,robbndahood,4,Mon Apr 20 17:59:34 2015 UTC,"unfortunately most big Barolo/Barbaresco are rarely under $35 and aren't typically considered value wines for weeknight sippers. But then again they're built to age, so they're more structured & tight and don't reveal much when popped & poured on release. Saying that, i've found that are some underappreciated Nebbiolo's which are more open & fruit-driven with tannins in check... they're lighter & less complex, so their prices reflect that. Porro's Barolo & Luigi Pira's Serralunga come to mind, as does Pelissero's Barbarescos. Also outlying communes offer good value: Vallana's Gattinara, Massimo Clerico's Spanna, Corregia's Roero are some wines to search out."

Lots of fresh, ripe green pear. Candle wax, fresh white flowers and lots of minerality. Just a slight bit of menthol herbal tones.  Bright citrus fruit on the pallet and a focus on acidity and minerality. A bit of of that juicy fruit gum even. Medium body and light texture.

wine,33655y,StayPuft12,3,Mon Apr 20 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"I buy wine for the restaurant, arrange tastings and educations for the staff (often with the winemaker or winery staff, I live in NorCal) and help staff sell wine on the floor.

I wont say im a wine salesman because mostly im stalking wine and helping people find something they like.  My question for you is how do you buy wine for the restaurant? To me this is very interesting because if I had a somm come in and buy wine from me id probably freak out! Do you work directly with distributors or are you going to stores buying cases?

wine,33655y,hot_like_wasabi,2,Mon Apr 20 07:32:31 2015 UTC,"Self-study for theory, blind tasting, and sparkling service. That's really all there is to it. Look at your local Meet Ups website to see if there's a blind tasting group in your area. Join the CMS and watch the message boards for events. Read the recommended supplementary books. Open a ton of sparkling wine while getting asked questions simultaneously. That's for Level Two - Certified Sommelier.   For Level One - Introductory Sommelier you really just need to have some previous wine knowledge and show up for the two day course. It's all multiple choice theory questions that are covered in the seminars. It was pretty damn simple if you have even a moderate familiarity with the wine industry."

I've made flash cards for all the test questions from the WSET and am halfway through the Zraly book making flash cards from all the end of chapter Q's. I am also taking that online course from University of Adelaide that somebody posted on here. I recently met an advanced level Somm and he told me to forget about the WSET which I was going to take at Johnson and Wales in the spring, do you agree? I have been in the restaurant business for close to two decades and certainly know more than the average person about wine but I want to make sure I'm not plunking down what to me is a large chunk of money to take the tests, just to find out I'm way off course in terms of knowledge. I've opened countless bottles of Champagne so I feel quite comfortable with that. My biggest fear is blind tasting so I suppose I will look for a meet up group for that to get some practice under my belt."

There's a mandatory two day seminar before the test - they tell you pretty much everything you need to know to pass. Read Karen McNeill's Wine Bible and you'll be more then good to go. After that you'll have a better idea of taking Level Two and becoming a Certified Sommelier.   WSET: It really depends on what part of the industry you want to stay in. CMS is great for working within a restaurant. WSET, CSW, and CWE are great for being in the wine industry without working in a restaurant (wholesale, education, wineries, etc).   There is a noted ""rivalry"" between certain certifications. My company employs 8 Master Sommeliers (think we're trying to collect a whole set?) and they are distinctly favorable towards the CMS. That's OK, but it's a bias that doesn't necessarily need to exist.   My boyfriend has been in the wine industry for years and runs a wine bar. He decided to jump in with both feet and take WSET 3 without any other prior certifications. He's challenged by the course so far, but it's in no way beyond his ability.   Honestly, your mileage may vary with all of these things, but it's likely not nearly as hard as you think it is. Until you get to CMS Advanced or Master, of course - that shit is no joke."

I lucked out into working for my supplier and haven't looked back since. It helps to have great wine knowledge, a flexible personality, a moderate level of intelligence - and you must be almost entirely self-motivated.   There's also a significant difference between working for a supplier and working for a mainpad distributor. Mainpad has quotas, stress, full-commision compensation, and a truly unprecedented amount of competition and bullshit. You're also likely selling a full book - wine, beer, and spirits.   When you work for a supplier you sell only their product - whatever it may be. I sell only wine from a single parent company, 90% of it is over $10 per bottle wholesale, no box wine or commodity bullshit, and it spans the globe with a heavier presence in the New World.

Also keep in mind that age-worthy wine is the exception not the rule: only some varieties, from some producers on some vintages can age, better check ageing potential on Wine Spectator or Wine Advocate. Speaking of Italian wine you could search for Nebbiolo based wines (Barolo, Barbaresco, Ghemme, Valtellina), Brunello di Montalcino, Taurasi, Aglianico and Sagrantino di Montefalco."

The level should be well up into the neck of the bottle - have a look at new bottles for a guideline. If there is significant ullage, it may have been in less than ideal conditions, heat may have caused some wine to evaporate through the cork, and with it, oxygen has been allowed into the wine, and it's probably vinegar.  Have a look at the top of the cork, the foil may have a hole or two in it through which you can see the cork. If it looks red or there's leakage/staining on the foil, avoid.   If it's a gift, look for staining on the label, that may also indicate poor storage. Any rips or tears are probably just aesthetic."

It's bad enough you run the risk of TCA but to have it get cooked, oxidized, etc really sucks. inspect the capsule. if there's any stickiness around it, avoid that wine. you can usually see runs of wine caked onto the neck/shoulders of the wine bottle. A cool trick also (besides pushing the cork, that's a good pointer, nice call Kafkian) is to spin the capsule. Not all capsules will rotate, but if you can spin it, then that's evidence that there's nothing ""glue-ing"" the capsule to the bottle.   How's the label look? if it's beat to shit, or there's long gouges, it could mean someone moved it around a lot. That shit should be left in the dark! around 55-61 F, and for the love of pete on it's side so the cork is constantly wet. You have all those conditions then swing for the fences. As for regions in 1994 that produced some pretty good wine i'd stick with:  Napa Cabs, Bordeaux Sauternes, Cote D'or Burgundy, Vintage Champagne from '94, and Piedmont was good (Barolo + Barbaresco)  Happy Carousing!"

Unfortunately most of the climate in the great white north doesn't allow for wine grape growing of any particular quality.   Almost all the grape wine comes from B.C. and Ontario with a little bit coming out of the maritime provinces.   There are appellation provisions can't remember how they all go. More importantly is the VQA designating wine made in Canada from grapes grown in Canada. If it is Canadian wine with out the VQA then the juice source could be from anywhere in the world.

Due to licensing fees (and some disagreement regarding the value of the label) there has been some backlash against the brand in many circles. Now, it's still strong in Ontario and somewhat used in BC but not yet applied to Nova Scotia or Quebec. There are some advocates pushing for them to set compatible standards but it is a bit of work yet.

wine,333irs,snugglebuttt,2,Sun Apr 19 14:38:22 2015 UTC,"Lees (fermentation):       Lees refers to deposits of dead yeast or residual yeast and other particles that precipitate, or are carried by the action of ""fining"", to the bottom of a vat of wine after fermentation and aging. The yeast deposits in beer brewing are known as trub. However, yeast deposits from secondary fermentation of both wine and beer are referred to as lees. This material is the source for most commercial tartaric acid, which is used in cooking and in organic chemistry.   Normally the wine is transferred to another container (racking), leaving this sediment behind. Some wines (notably Chardonnay, Champagne and Muscadet) are sometimes aged for a time on the lees (a process known as sur lie), leading to a distinctive yeasty aroma and taste. The lees may be stirred (bâtonage in French) in order to promote uptake of the lees' flavour.  The lees are an important component in the making of Ripasso where the leftover lees from Amarone are used to impart more flavour and colour to partially aged Valpolicella.

If you have a client base with deep pockets and sell 90% of your wines direct, then you might just be fine selling those bottles.  Let's wait for the Napa Cab '12 vintage to come out though, and see how it does. If it does well, then it's going to be another big score for Beckstoffer.

wine,3313oq,arnaudh,2,Sun Apr 19 19:33:46 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I'm seeing the '12s already selling strong because those same publications dumped all over the '11s so the restaurants and retailers tried to skip the vintage. Caymus released their '12 40th Anniversary nearly a year ago it feels like haha. But I think this subset of 2012 (Beckstoffer To Kalon) will do just fine given in the DTC world and will continue to do so. He's achieving the equivalent of Grand Cru status whereby vineyard is more important than producer for the consumer.

The former is a ""marque domaniale"" or ""marque de château,"" what we might call the vineyard brand, and the latter is just a normal brand that could be used for anything the parent company wishes or could be sold independently.   I'm sure you're all thrilled by this... I need to find more hobbies =("

wine,333x4q,Muppet_Mower,1 point,Sun Apr 19 11:56:06 2015 UTC,"All the wines were served blind, just 3 of us to start, using a coravin on most of the bottles. New to writing notes...  1 Mazone Barolo 2006: Very closed off, little to no aroma. Put to the side to let it open up, but even after about 45 minutes in the glass it was still closed. Soft tannins surprisingly, very red fruit forward, cherry, raspberry, little to no oak. Was just average.  2 Cascina Ballarina 2010: This wine was very accessible, tons of ripe red fruit, nice earthiness. Tannins were a little more aggressive than the Manzone. Put to the side and revisited about 25 minutes later. Really opened up, I think the wine has serious potential.  3 2012 Rivers Marie Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir: Took about 2 minutes for my boss to call Sonoma coast Pinot, Riper than I want, but I am just starting to get to know Pinot. Not as textured as some of the other Pinot I have drank recently. Cherry, little bit of Raspberry, the oak was there, and a little bit overbearing of the fruit.  4 Dante Rivetti Bricco de Nueis Barberesco 1996: This stuff was incredible, tons of complexity in the nose, ripe red fruits, sandalwood, herbs, little bit of mineral. On the tongue the wine was so awesome, texture was beautiful, lots of fruit, menthol. Tannins were very soft at this point. One of the best wines I have had. My first introduction into aged Nebbiolo. I loved it.  5 Tablas Creek Rouge 1998: Tablas Creek is one of the few wineries I have actually been to. I really enjoy their wines, my buddy gave this bottle to me for my birthday. We didn't blind it, just popped and poured. Unfortunately it was over the hill. Little bit of oxidation, and very dead in the mouth. Was a bummer, but still fun to try.  6 Franciscan Napa Valley Merlot 2005: My neighbor gave me this bottle when they moved out. You could tell it was stored a little hot, but it was showing pretty decent. This wine was a beast. The tannins were incredibly grippy, high acids and tons of oak. Nice aromas, roasemary, red fruits, and oak.  7 Reyvaan The Contender 2012: This wine was close to WOTN for me, if you take the 96 Barberesco out of the picture it was the best wine we tried. Tons of smoked meat, bacon fat, dark fruit and scorched earth. Ripe blue and black fruit with high tannins and great minerality. This wine was a little bit Primary, I imagine in 5 to 10 years it is going to be absolutely stunning. Was a pleasure to try, hoping I can pick up a bottle or two to lay down.  8 St. Supery Reserve Rutherford Ranch Cab 2009: This wine was awesome. Ripe blue and black fruit, loamy earth, sweet tannins.  I  have notes for some of the other wines, palette was starting to get fatigued after the cab. Very fun tasting, can't wait to do another."

You said you have a Purple Pin seeking his green; have him administer Service exams for you. For tasting, i'd do two at a time and give yourself 15 minutes. Go on Court website to get the tasting sheets and get 'em dialed in. With the CSW, I think in 3 months you'd be top of your class for Certified with practicing tasting and service once a week.

France is much more consistent across regions in terms of good character and balance.   However, that is probably due to things that can be changed easily, vineyard practices, etc. It's funny to read about how a booming harvest led to collapsing prices, when you could just drop the fruit on the damn ground before it ripens and improve quality at the same time.   But it's that ""bulk wine"" mentality. The growers are trying to get every last grape they can, and honestly are probably plumping the fruit before harvest to increase the weight, which lowers quality. It's going to take some pioneers in La Mancha to shake the growers by the collar and force them to adopt different practices related to yields and irrigation."

The law is setup this way because each city has its own local laws for liquor stores, how many, and where they can be in TN. It's to regulate competition as much as anything. I'm sure it's the same in other states.  The good news for Tennesseans is that a law was passed a year ago making wine for sale in grocery’s legal, and will go in effect in 2016.

wine,32z3fo,dennycee,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"Go to any of the wineries' tasting rooms. Nectar, Barrister, Arbor Crest, Patit Creek, etc. They should be able to guide you through different wines and teach you a little bit. You'll probably have to pay a tasting fee, but that is usually reimbursed or discounted with purchase of a bottle.   I honestly doubt that she understands what it takes to become a Sommelier... Additionally, most red wines are dry. She is probably thinking of tannins, which can make the mouth feel dry.   I suggest a date for both of you at Arbor Crest. They have a beautiful location."

Everything interesting was either ""sold out"" or not very competitive compared to the best pricing on winesearcher. The one cent first time shipping could make for a decent buy I suppose.   If you're going to start buying online, look around some, don't just buy through delectable because it's easy. There's lots of great retailers."
wine,32x9la,andtheodor,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:17:14 2015 UTC,"There's your convenience fee though. I mean, yes you can get a better deal probably but then you have to put a bunch of effort in (or just get really lucky.) Delectable has done all the searching for you and will sell you the wine at a reasonable (i.e., not necessarily the best, but certainly not bad) price.   It's sort of the same as when I go to my local wine stores: yes I can get the same thing online for less usually, but then I'm doing all the work myself. That is, I have to find something that might be nice, order it (paying for shipping), and try it and from start to finish it's a giant guess as to whether or not it'll be any good. The guys at the store have done that for me and then for a small fee I can use their expertise to save me a bunch of effort and potentially money on wines I might not like."

wine,32z2r7,mattolson,2,Fri Apr 17 22:38:26 2015 UTC,"Hang out at Oxbow Market in Napa. Great food (oyster bar, hispter coffee, excellent pizza, etc.). The Model Bakery and the Fatted Calf next door are great stores too. Killer burgers at Gott's. Have a beer (and maybe some BBQ) or of course wine at the Bounty Hunter downtown Napa, where lots of industry folks meet over there are the end of the day. Good wine lineup too. Backroom Wines across the street is a good wine store too. Wineries I'd hit: Trefethen (3rd generation Napa winery, excellent wines, hit hard during the earthquake), Inglenook (Coppola's joint) for the history, Chateau Montelena (again, for the history), make an appointment at Maisonry for more tastings, and have a tasting or two at a by-appointment only places in the mountains like Pride, Altamura... just explore the mountain districts. And maybe Darioush because of the unique ambiance: place is nothing like other tasting rooms. It looks like the inside of a fancy club. It's ridiculous. But the wines are good. It will just be a nice break from the standard neo-tuscan/faux French architecture from other wineries. Have at least one tasting at a sparkling producer. That means either Domaine Carneros, Mumm Napa or Domaine Chandon. All 3 places are great. Don't follow highway 29 - drive Silverado Trail, like the locals. Quicker during the day, and much prettier. Plenty of great restaurants. Bouchon in Yountville, Miramoto in Napa, etc. If you don't have a reservation, many of them will allow you to dine at the bar. Often a better experience than a formal table. You can connect with the service folks who will have plenty of recommendations.   My best advice would be to alternate low-key and fancy destinations. That's what wine country is about."
wine,32z2r7,arnaudh,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"Great advice.  I wish I could upvote each bullet individually.  I would add:   the restaurant Redd in Yountville is worth a stop.  their house red is really good.  I was told it's made for them by Dominus. Castello di Amorosa is a very cool tour of an Italian castle including torture chambers.  And pretty good wines, too. If you do go to Morimoto's in Napa, do the Chef's Tasting Menu.  It's 10 courses of pure decadent food heaven. Vi Sattui is a place we stop for picnic supplies.  Chateau Montelena has two islands on their lake where club members can have picnics.  You could call and ask about availability, and maybe they will let you use one.  Bring a picnic lunch from Vi Sattui, and have it on an island in the Jade Lake. Cole's Chophouse is a very good steak house, if you want that sort of meal, or if you're staying somewhere you can cook, pick up some 42-day Dry Aged Ribeye's from the Oxbow Market, and have it with an amazing bottle of something.   edit   For breakfast, go to the Boon Fly Cafe.  They make the most amazing corned beef hash with a jalapeno hollandaise sauce.  NOM NOM NOM.  And they make their own doughnuts. (So good.)"

wine,32z2r7,flicman,2,Tue Apr 21 02:27:37 2015 UTC,"All great advice so far. I'll add this:  Pick a particular sub-AVA and spend a day or two there. Try as many different wineries' offerings as you can (spit!) and you'll have the opportunity to really learn about a specific region. The Carneros is one of my favorite places on earth, and they happen to make great Pinot Noirs and Chards, too - bonus!  I also suggest Dry Creek almost at the very opposite end of wine country - Zinfandel. It's finally shrunk back from its 10,000% alcohol days of a few years ago to something much more respectable (and drinkable) these days.  Also eat everything in the world. Every place is almost better than the place before it.   Man, I wanna go now."

wine,32yym0,Renzulli,7,Fri Apr 17 22:01:23 2015 UTC,"It's a good rule of thumb that you shouldn't cook with a wine that you wouldn't drink.  If it tastes gross, then it will make your food taste gross.  If you need something cheap to cook with, I would recommend getting a box wine anyways, since it will stay good after being used.  An opened jug will let air in and spoil the wine, but the bag/spout inside the box is airtight.  Black Box is decent enough and won't run you too much.  If you need a cheap jar for making tea, I'd recommend just washing out a large pickle jar."

wine,32swob,CondorKhan,8,Thu Apr 16 13:26:53 2015 UTC,"So I spent last weekend in NYC and without there being a plan or anything, our drinking for Sunday ended up being 100% Italian.   First up, while having a late lunch at the ultra crowded and overpriced but otherwise fantastic Eataly, 2013 Le Vigne Di Zamo Friuli Colli Orientali Friulano from a classic producer of Friuli.  This has notes of pear and peaches, and a nice, almondy finish. It has considerable weight in the palate and a good acidity. It was a fantastic match for the breaded swordfish I was having.  Later on, for post-dinner drinks at Alla’Onda which is a wine bar with a crazy Italian selection. 2010 Coste Della Sesia “Tera Russa” Pietro Cascina from the Piemontese appellation of Coste Della Secia (which barely gets a sentence in the Sotheby’s Encyclopedia of Wine) was a rather expensive Coravin pour, yet I can’t find enough information online to know if I was stiffed or not. I was my first experience with pure varietal Vespolina, which usually is a blending grape with Nebbiolo in Gattinara and Ghemme. Anyway, the first impression is the absolutely incredible nose, full of red fruit, spice, vanilla and herbs. Extraordinary and intoxicating. On the palate, very light bodied, with notes of mostly red cherry, cranberry and a slight herbal edge. Classy and elegant. This drinks like an expensive Burgundy. I’m wondering why this isn’t more popular.  Lastly Albana di Romagna “Santa Lusa” Ancarani 2012 from Emilia Romagna. This is amphora fermented orange wine (white wine made with extended skin contact like red wine) made from the unusual Albana grape which I’ve never had before. Aroma of sweet orange and a slight hint of fino sherry tang. On the palate, dried figs, orange peel and black tea, with slight Sherry oxidation. Finish is long, with significant but well integrated tannins. This is like drinking a very well brewed cup of orange tea. Mixed with Belgian Gueuze. The somm told me that this is their gateway to get people into orange wines. It is indeed a very friendly and welcoming example of the style. Unusual but not weird."
wine,32swob,GahMatar,3,Thu Apr 16 13:27:07 2015 UTC,"I thought Le Vigne Di Zamo's Pinot Grigio (bought at Bishop Cellars in Halifax, NS) was fantastic and highly distinctive. It's an orange wine with half the grapes spending 4 days on skins. I didn't take any notes however (had it in late Feb.)"

It doesn't take much wit to understand the implications go far beyond what you stated in your first comment. It takes some humility to think that you might not be above the ideas expressed in this article, and that you just have to think about it and engage it a little more seriously. Maybe you're an experienced wine importer and it's not that complicated to you, but it seems more likely - based on the analysis you provided in your first comment - that you just didn't take the care to understand the complexity of what the author was explaining.  Please think about shedding your hubris before commenting, at least to my posts and comments.

wine,32w678,Cailyus,5,Fri Apr 17 05:23:57 2015 UTC,"I expected it to take me a few years to get accepted to the advanced test, but it took me just about a year. I may be a rare case, but you never know. So I ended up sitting for my exam less than two years after my intro. This is not advised unless you're a wunderkind or prodigy (let's face it most of us are not).  So my advice would be to not apply for at least another year or two and just read, taste and enjoy for a while. Don't dive into the studying too quickly. The most important thing I learned from my first test attempt (I passed tasting and service, missed theory) is that experience is paramount to success, and studying is secondary. Use your new credentials, look for new positions, move your way up and just gather experience. Let yourself use the books and studying as a way to help you in your work, and don't make your primary goal passing the next test.  Otherwise, your question about forming a grid to help you study, that's a crazy complicated question, and it's super personal. Use the guildsomm.com site's study guides to base your focus. If it's in the study guides, it absolutely fair game for the advanced."
wine,32w678,MindTheVine,3,Fri Apr 17 14:57:45 2015 UTC,"I know people who have been in the industry for a long time and have been rejected from the advanced sommelier program multiple times. It may take you a while to apply for it.  For now, study the most well known producers from top regions in every major continent. Study the soil, climate, mesoclimate, and microclimate for each, and finally the viticulture practices in each (biodynamic, sustainable, etc.) Keep fresh on your blind tasting and start narrowing down your wines to the above mentioned criteria."
wine,32w678,onehitwonder92,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:24:29 2015 UTC,"The best thing you can do is find your 3 MS mentors/references that you will need for your advanced application. I spoke with Sur Lucero at a tasting a few days ago and he said if I had not applied yet for advanced that it would probably be 2017 before I get in. So I say find those references before November when applications are due, start tasting, and just apply.   Worst case scenario you don't get in this year. Best case you get advanced course only no exam. I'm kicking myself for not applying last year when I had the resources."
wine,32tmrh,Lawnfrost,4,Thu Apr 16 16:49:52 2015 UTC,"My advice would be short and sweet, as many have already provided substantial and quality suggestions.  Get involved in the community, and help with local events and pour wine. Help throw tastings, pour at charity things, donate wines for auctions. The retail stores that I find to be the most successful put on or participate in at least a couple events per month outside of the store . It's great advertising, it helps build the community, and it's a great time to make connections.   For instance, at the resorts near where I live (since you're near the beach I assume you have some resorts nearby), they will throw little social wine tasting get-togethers where a local shop brings a selection of wine, usually donated by the distributors, so mostly zero cost to the store. Then the store or the supplier pours the wine, take orders for discounts, and even offers delivery.   Things like this don't necessarily sell tons of wine during the event, but it certainly makes people want to come to your store, as they'll get to know you and probably find some favorite wines that you carry. So while you guys seem more than willing to host events at your store, try and do some of that in the community, and build a report."
wine,32tmrh,MindTheVine,3,Thu Apr 16 20:53:33 2015 UTC,"My two pence:  None of the wine is lying down. It looks a bit walmart with a load of wine stood up. I would think twice before buying premium wine from this store - at $350 i'd want it in temp and hum controlled condition.  The shelves do look bare.  Having talkies on every bottle and free enomatics machines discourages your staff from having to interact with customers. Good customer service from well trained staff will always beat the other two. If someone is looking for a food pairing, even if they are shy or unsociable at first, they'll enjoy more being given some bespoke options or working through preferences, rather than reading until they get bored. The internet has more and better talkies than your store!  Do events (as above)  Charge for enomatics samples. You can turn over more bottles on the machines and stop freeloaders wasting your time. Also you can offer credit as a loyalty or reward system.  MY BIGGEST turn-off is the reliance on rating and faith placed in he who must not be named and other ignominius publications. If people want points, they can get better prices online. Your customers will assume that you stock wine that you think are good and interesting. Lose the training wheels.  Lastly - kudos on carrying the Billecart-Salmon Rose. I wasn't expecting that!"
wine,32tmrh,square_mile,2,Thu Apr 16 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"Bottles standing up are for display only (on the front of the shelves) - bottles we sell are lying down behind them (and anything premium is in CC storage in the office [Mayas, Contadors, etc]) - but I do appreciate your concern!      Unfortunately the store layout is pretty fixed as of now - there isn't really an option to remodel significantly at this location to optimize storage & display  Luckily it's just me here 6 days a week - I have a part timer to help cover classes/tastings/events.... the shelf talkers offer a nice 'snippet' of information for the layman consumer - they don't know crap about wine and are too afraid to commit to answering staff member lest they reveal their ignorance... but again I appreciate your comments - there's no reason to remove the shelf talkers - I can talk for days about the wines but not everyone wants that - so this way they have options.    Charging for Enomatic samples is something we have discussed - maybe offering 1/2 oz free samples, 3 oz mid size pours, and 6 oz glasses as well. Bottle turnover is never really an issue - the bottles get used up before they start to go downhill, but there are a decent amount of freeloaders that could be culled (not many repeat offenders thankfully, but there are some)  To be honest. I hate the reliance on the rating system. The owners are open to the idea of changing the concept (it was their idea to focus on rated wines only in the first place) - but it will be a process - the brand has been in existence for 3 years. The reliance on ratings are absolutely training wheels - and it's probably my biggest issue with the brand as a whole, and definitely our biggest hurdle to overcome.  Thank you so much for your feedback, I appreciate it greatly."
wine,32tmrh,ourmodelcitizen,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:58:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but...  The shelf talkers can be streamlined. Price, region, little icons with food pairings, point ratings (e.g., R.P. 91 pts).  /u/square_mile is right when he/she says that shelf talkers are training wheels. If you take them away--or only use them when you're trying to feature a wine--it forces the customer to talk to you, ask you questions, and then you can do hand selling, which will totally bring people back.   The people who are too uncomfortable to talk to you aren't going to talk to you anyway. Those who might talk to you are given an excuse not to, since they can read the shelf talkers instead.  Enomatic: great tool. Charge $5 for a tasting, something small. If they buy a wine that's featured in that tasting, no charge. Easy."
wine,32tmrh,dzs_wine,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:44:47 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with /u/square_mile as well re: the point system reliance. By focusing on 90+ rated wines, you are catering only to one realm of wine drinkers, and that limits your potential revenue streams. You should certainly have some highly rated wines for score chasers, but there are plenty of wine drinkers who don't care at all about that stuff and would rather get to know you and buy wine that is recommended by someone whose palate they trust and who knows what they want to drink."

wine,32tmrh,Carl_Schmitt,2,Fri Apr 17 15:17:21 2015 UTC,"Caveat: I've only managed shops in large cities with tons of foot traffic. So I'm not sure my advice will be entirely relevant to your situation, and every state has very different laws. And your collector's shelf picture isn't working--can you try to fix the link?  Your plan sounds good so far--in addition to outright case discounts I like the approach of giving a discount card that is scanned or punched (something like 12th bottle of comparable price is 99 cents) so people have an incentive to stay exclusive. And physical coupons can still be worth it if done right, both mailed out and in local papers.  1) Local same-day delivery service.  2) Your shelves look pretty bare. I know it's trendy, but I think it's psychologically off-putting. Create a sense of abundance by overflowing that shit--not the vibe of barely staying in business.  3) Floor-stacks of cheap, but still good shit. And a discount/odd-bottle bin if you don't already have one.  4) I hate those tasting machines. Make your lazy reps earn their commissions by coming in and pouring their shit at a table--at least a few tastings every week during peak traffic times.  5) I don't see anything that boutique-y in the working picture, but there could very well be no market for obscure stuff where you are. Maybe put out a suggestion box or just talk to people to try and gauge where your market is at right now. Look at what the big shops in big wine markets are selling on their websites and try to get ahead of the trends, but still keeping in mind you're probably in a place a few years behind them.  6) If you have some hard to get, desirable stuff make sure to take advantage of wine-searcher.com if you're willing and able to ship."

I do have reps come in and pour (every 2 weeks) 5) I use the term boutique as a generalization; it's not that we carry  obscure wines, just wines the local populace will not find at the local grocery chains or Costco... 6) Excellent idea - I can get us listed on wine-searcher.com, we ship domestically and have a fully functioning online store."

Occasionally a rep comes in and does a more professional tasting that is also typically successful.   the other store i go to has an enormous selection and a very strong relationship with their suppliers so the suppliers will come in and do tastings at their store to represent the clients that they are trying to push to the community.   the key that i notice from these two stores (and I'm sure you're working on this) is customer loyalty. These guys know their customers names and establish awesome relationships with returning wine drinkers. My advice would be to earn the communities trust by FIRST selling what they definitely want to buy (the obvious stuff that sells itself; i.e. Meiomi) - while they're learning that they can buy the stuff they want from you, use that time to establish a dialogue and relationship that will make them feel comfortable returning. Once they trust you - then you can use your knowledge and expertise to show them what they SHOULD be drinking.  have good substitutions in mind for wines that they want but you don't have or might be out of - oh you're looking for wine A? sorry we are out of this right now but id definitely recommend wine B, if you like wine A then you should try wine B its a big seller here.  Gain their interest by gaining their loyalty. Once the know they can buy their table wine from you - youl be in a better position to introduce new, exciting, and more interesting wine to your community."

wine,32t8xt,Muppet_Mower,2,Thu Apr 16 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I own and operate a cheese and wine shop, if that validates my opinion at all.  I assume by ""goat cheese"" you mean a fresh chevre.  There are many kinds of goat cheeses, in a huge range of flavor profiles. Anyhow, assuming you mean fresh chevre I would usually suggest something tart, acidic and clean- Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc, maybe Gruener Veltliner.  However, you are not really asking for a pairing with goat cheese, you are asking for a pairing with pizza and all these toppings.   With the jalepeno and sausage, I think something a bit richer like Anjou or Rioja Blanco might be nice.  If you were to do a red, maybe something heavy on Cabernet Franc for the peppery aspects, or Carrignan for the earthy/dirty flavors.  You could possibly get away with a lighter bodied Bordeaux with a high proportion of Malbec and some Merlot, for the earthy/dark olive notes."

wine,32svaw,FatTonyTCL,6,Thu Apr 16 13:14:37 2015 UTC,"I once had a Danish apple wine. It was made on a Danish apple variety (Ingrid Marie).  The vinification is that they make an apple eiswein add eau-de-vie up to 20%. It is then aged for 8 months in 220 liter white wine barrels.  It was more of an aperitif wine or could go with an apple heavy desert. The aroma was of apples (surprise!), honey and caramel and had a quite good balance of sweetness and acidity, considering the purposes above.  (It might be worth mentioning that I'm from Denmark, so I didn't go to obscure lengths to try this)  Edit: I forgot to mention that a 50 cl bottle of this would set you back roughly $50. I wouldn't put off buying it at that price, however the only reason it could be worth that much is because it's from the same region as me, so the value lies more in the novelty of the wine than the actual quality, which was still very good, but I reckon I could get other wines that did the same job just cheaper."
wine,32svaw,a_esbech,6,Thu Apr 16 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"There are several reasons.   Lack of consumer demand. Possibly the most radical change we've seen in fermented beverages in the U.S. over the past few years in the mainstream consumer landscape is the rise of hard ciders. Angry Orchard is on the tap in tons of bars, and plenty of breweries are now making a cider - using processes which much more closely resembles winemaking than brewing. But that's about it. The fad for ""orange"" wines was just that - a fad. Most consumers are not interested in those. It's not a commercially viable thing. It's a nice little novelty item for wine club members, period. There are plenty of fruit wines made in the South or Hawaii. They are still also mostly a novelty, even to locals. They're usually pretty boring after the first sips. There's a reason barely any of it is exported to other markets. At least in the U.S., breaking away from grape wine making means licensing issues. For instance, in California, a bonded winery may produce a mead. But if it were to include grain (like some meads do), then it would require a brewing license as well. Which is why in the U.S., meads are mostly produced by breweries, not wineries. Besides the licensing issues, the investment in equipment can be significant. The risk of contamination using a new set of ingredients can also be a problem."

wine,32svaw,winemule,3,Thu Apr 16 20:57:33 2015 UTC,"Some of the more unusual ""wines"" I've had were made with flowers rather than fruit.  Elderflower and lavender come to mind.  Elderflower is interesting for sure.  But while lavender of course smelled lovely it reminded me of drinking perfume.  When it comes to wine I find many people are not willing to go outside their comfort zone.  Beer drinkers seem to be willing to try new things.  But then there's a lot less ""risk"" if you buy a beer and don't really like it.  A bottle of wine represents a much bigger investment for most people, if only a psychological investment.  This is one of the reasons I'd really like to see more wines in kegs.  Offering these unusual wines by the glass might help people get over their inhibition and explore these little wine niches.  But in my experience many BTG menus are stocked with perennial favorites that are sure to sell, as to minimize the risk to the restaurant/bar.  Which is understandable."

I think you've got a good point about the BTG for weird ones in a keg, I think a lot more people would gamble as /u/WigwamTheMighty put it, on a glass at a bar than a whole bottle anytime, especially if the bottles are in the $15 price range.

You are not going to spend money on land in traditional wine making area's (Napa, Bordeaux, Pfalz, ect.) and plant a crop you will be gambling on. Its also why those area's only plant certain grapes. They know it will sell. Its also the expectation of people going to or buying from those area's are going to get certain type of wine. Personally i'd like to see more places trying non traditional wines to that area. Its fun to me.   Here in VA you can get a traditional sweeter fruit wine at a lot of places.

It's just not going to catch on unless they first try to emulate 'standard' wine more to draw people in. That said, here in Europe wine drinkers are more 'conservative' and they highly favour wines that are traditionally known to be of good quality."
wine,32svaw,kaseycarpenter,2,Thu Apr 16 15:12:38 2015 UTC,"I've had the pleasure of trying a lot of 5-10 year old dry meads as well as making my own dry mead and they are fantastic. I feel mead definitely needs to make a comeback.  Wine is very easily imparted with flavour from anything it is exposed to. Just see how much it takes from oak or oxidation. If ordinary wine is infused or made with extra ingredients, it will lose a lot of its original character and it'll mostly taste of whatever it was infused with, not far off from flavoured lambrini. Higher end wines might stand up to added ingredients, but there just isn't a market currently for expensive adulterated wines. There are notable exceptions like Barolo Chinato and Vermouth.  However, I would argue wine is so excellent because it is a pure expression of the grapes with which it is made. And there are so many styles and variations made all over the world, many of which are only made regionally and often don't make it to the local shop."

wine,32svaw,kaseycarpenter,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"I keep trying pumpkin wine but something about it in wine form just hasn't worked for me yet. B. Nectar Meadery in Detroit is making phenomenal fruit, cider, and spiced meads that I recommend to anyone. They price their 12oz bottle a bit high so they aren't for everyone. New Day meadery in Indianapolis is doing some really interesting things with mead (both still and carbonated), and cider. They'll add spices, fruit, and I've seen hops additions. I had a wine that was finished with Lime Juice from Prairie state winery in Illinois, it was semi-sweet crisp and refreshing, a great summer drink. I had a Tomato and hot pepper wine from FL that I thought had a lot of tomato flavor but something else was going on that wasn't for me.    I've heard of some wineries in Kentucky that are aging their wines in bourbon barrels but haven't had an opportunity to sample one yet but I'm really curious.  It seems like mead is branching out more than wine, maybe because they are already making something different? Though there are plenty of wines that could easily lead themselves to adding fruit or spices added to them like Pino Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Seyval Blanc, Rose, and some lighter flavored reds from cooler climates as well."

The Grenache-Shiraz I tried was 'The Green Room'. I bought it thinking it would be a lighter style, since when you hold it up to the light, it's fairly transparent. But no, the glass used is clear. Which is bad news for trying to keep a wine stable, especially one which is proudly 'minimal sulphites'. I gave it plenty of time, and returned it to the store the next day. The manager of the store re-opened it, we both tried it, and yep, still smells like oxidised moscato, yep, still dominated by unpleasant bitter astringency. Manager opened another one, exactly the same. Got my money back.  Since you know Taras so well, you refer to him by first name and all, maybe tell him to include some actual information about the wines on the website? Instead of this peripheral rabble about driving across the country in a Volkswagen van, and their logo representing 'a labyrinth of flavour, texture and emotion'.   Literally everything on his website, and everything you posted about him using egg shaped fermenters, etc... Is so obnoxiously hipster, that the only thing missing is some square-framed glasses and a red flannel. You just had to throw in the comment about him being too good for the aussie wineries he'd worked for, bashing them as gloopy or whatever.  Doesn't matter if we agree on that or not, saying that is straight up unprofessional and disrespectful to the people who made his career. And wholly, unabashedly Pretentious, with a capital P.  Oh, he's too laid back to be pretentious? Oh but if he wasn't so laid back, he'd 'deck' me? I'm confused.  Sounds like you need a glass, champ. Don't get worked up about some guy on the internet disagreeing with you. I'm glad you posted here so we could have this dialogue. Your review is interesting, I hope you post more.

I haven't had such a good experience with the wines, and thought I should also share that. I didn't mean to shit on your parade here, but this is a discussion forum. You bought up the whole hipster-winemaking thing pre-emptively, and I thought that warranted some further discussion, as I define a hipster (in the context of winemaking) as someone who shoehorns their own ideologies into an otherwise neutral and humble agricultural industry free of statements of ego, and uses these ideologies as a soapbox to make themselves feel superior to those who follow a different path.  We joke and exaggerate about how the word 'hipster' intrinsically has something to do with aesthetics, but to me it's really an attitude. Having a website like that, espousing your beliefs all while making the statement that the people who helped his career produce, to him, wines that are undrinkable, is the height of pretentious douchebaggery and lands this winemaker square in the middle of what many would define as a 'hipster', in this context.  There's a big difference from me, some guy on the internet, calling a spade a spade, and a famous winemaker rubbishing his peers and former colleagues.

Also, it's incredibly hyped. Apparently, at some point, sales of it were by allocation. I saw this at my local supermarket for what I thought would be a fair price so I snapped it up.  2014 Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc   pictar  Pours very clear pale greenish yellow.  On the nose, cat pee, skunk and what I suppose gooseberries smell like.  On the palate, green herbal flavors, bell peppers and grass balanced against an impressive array of tropical fruit, passionfruit, grapefruit, lime, starfruit. Significant body and concentration. Finish is long and acidic with some mineral notes.  Is it worth the hype? Well, yes, it's a fantastically made wine. Obviously classy. It had me going back for more even though it's not ""my style"". I got it for $23 bucks which is more than fair. I've seen it, however, at >$35. At that price, yes, it would be overpriced. For the right price, I'd buy it again and again."

wine,32onhz,brewstah,8,Thu Apr 16 01:42:32 2015 UTC,"Grey Rock Sauvignon Blanc Reserve 2013, $17 Marlborough NZ  Smells of apples, honeydew melon, grapefruit, lime and peach. Much less ""green"" than most NZ Sauvignon Blanc that I've had, though it does still have a hint of a Vegetable/grassy scent behind the more powerful fruit and citrus.   Just slightly off dry, Very well balanced acidity.  Tastes like green apple, underripe strawberry, lime, peach, honey and slightly of pineapple  I would Buy this again, especially if i had to buy my mother a bottle(she pretty much buys nothing but sauvignon blanc) It really needs food because of the acidity, though with a roasted chicken it pairs quite nicely. i enjoyed how it was very fruity, with citrus backing it up and the grassy and green flavors and smells just there enough to remind you of what you are drinking. and there was no sense that i was drinking cat pee :)  There is a non reserve version of this wine for about $5 less, I'll have to compare the two and see if I should add this to my weeknight wine list."
wine,32onhz,enforcetheworld,4,Thu Apr 16 01:03:22 2015 UTC,"Girlfriend and I bought the non-reserve version to see if it was a ""standard"" NZ sauv blanc for a wine dinner she was putting together last September, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. We found the non-reserve version at Total Wine for around $10."
wine,32onhz,PhoenixRising20,9,Mon Apr 20 07:26:09 2015 UTC,"So, since NZ Sauvignon Blanc is relatively easy to come by here, I decided to choose wines from two different regions of NZ.  One from the more popular Marlborough region, and one from somewhere else.  I chose one from the Wairarapa region.  The differences were astonishing, and there was definitely a winner, so to speak!  Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2014  Marlborough, NZ  APPEARANCE  Pale straw yellow, long legs that cling to the glass.  NOSE  Passionfruit, melon, apricot and berries.  Herbal notes of tarragon and jalapeno.  TASTE  The green pepper notes are strong in this one.  There is some residual sugar left, giving it a slight sweet taste.  Strong, peppery acidity in this wine, it was the perfect foil for the chicken breast with blue cheese mushroom cream sauce I had at supper.  This wine has a long finish, and flavours of peach, passionfruit and melon really come through.  OVERALL  Refreshing and crisp, it made a great sipper to have with rich food, but the bell pepper flavour was a little strong for me.  I don’t think I would buy this one again.  Matahiwi Estate Sauvignon Blanc 2013 Wairarapa, NZ  APPEARANCE  Pale straw, long slow legs.  NOSE  Strawberry-banana milkshake, with hints of apricots, pear, peaches and sour apple Jolly Rancher.  Smells wonderful!  TASTE  The fruity nose gives way to slight green pepper on the palate.  Not as pronounced as the Oyster Bay, the green pepper and herbal notes quickly give way to peaches, passionfruit and apples.    OVERALL  This is a complete 180 from the Oyster Bay Sav. Blanc, and is what I assume the difference between north and south Island sav. Blancs.  I must say, I prefer the riper fruity notes of a more ripe Sauvignon Blanc, which is why I prefer some Canadian wines.  But this is nice.  It strikes a balance between the the green herbal notes of a less ripe grape, with the tropical fruit flavors of one thats more ripe.  I would definitely purchase this one again!"
wine,32onhz,jensvanavondt,8,Sat Apr 18 06:16:56 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm kind of new over here, but I wanted to participate this month because I've never had a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. I'm a big admirer of Sancerre and even Chilean Sauv Blanc so I was really stoked to try some as I heard NZ makes really good Sauvignon Blanc.  The wine I went with is the: Flaxbourne Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2014  (€7 - $8)  There was a lot of choise in my local grocery store, all in the 8 to 15 USD price range, so I went with the one which had the nicest label!   I could smell some wet stones, some hints of bellpepper and passion fruit, but the most prominent on the nose was the grapefruit smell. I didn't smell any grass, or asperagus, which I had expected finding somewhere.   When I tasted the wine the first thing that straight hit me was the big acidity of this wine. So much lemon zeste! The wine also has minerality and notes of passion fruit and some grassiness. Although the acidity was really big on this wine, it still was really well balanced.   If you like a fresh and dry wine, than this is the one for you. I love this wine, because it's so simple yet so complex and balanced. I will defenitly get some more of this to enjoy in the summer!"
wine,32onhz,911991,9,Mon Apr 20 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"2012 Elephant Hill Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay, North Island)  I'm relatively new to the world of wine, but I thought I'd give this a go.  As I knew nothing about Kiwi wine OR Sauv. Blanc, I decided to ask my friend who lives there what her favourites are for not too much money.  I ended up tracking this bottle down as there were less than 10 left in the province (yay for Monopolies).  Saga over. Here are my notes:  Very pale green-yellow  Moderate aroma with grapefruit, melon, herbaceous notes, and possibly gooseberries   Grass is the first thing that comes to mind when it hits your tongue however it's immediately followed up with citrus and a lovely peach.  Rather acidic, but I quite like that part of it.  It's the peach flavour that sticks around the longest.  I quite enjoyed it, and I'd definitely buy another bottle even though it's a tad over my self-imposed regular 20$ limit.  I learned that Kiwis know best when it comes to their wine, and I look forward to my second month doing the challenge.  Cheers  Edit: As it warms, I notice a tinge of minerality as well as some more pronounced veggie flavours"
wine,32onhz,SofiaFairborne,8,Wed Apr 22 03:41:48 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/Kvpz1kc  Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2012 - Marlborough, New Zealand  We had this white served alongside poached halibut. On the glass, it had a very pale, lemon hue. Looked wonderfully unctuous as I saw it being poured.  On the nose, its bell pepper characteristic isn't as dominating so as to obscure its apparent pear, apple, grapefruit notes.  On the palate, it is dry, full-bodied, with vibrant acidity. Gentle mouth feel I might add. Medium length finish with the capsicum lingering for a little while before slowly fading.  I would pour another glass were it not for its price point. Wonderfully made but high price point around $35 USD gives me pause."
wine,32onhz,dexcel,4,Wed Apr 22 06:15:11 2015 UTC,I agree the price tag on Cloudy Bay does seem unreasonably high for my taste buds. I like it but I have struggled to figure out what justifies the price
wine,32onhz,boogie96,8,Wed Apr 22 20:04:48 2015 UTC,"2013 Nobilo Icon Sauvignon Blanc, New Zealand (Marlborough)  Color was pale yellow and clear. The aroma was light; I had to really inhale to get the details, but did get notes of lemon, honeysuckle, and botanicals/grass. The wine was off dry verging on a light sweetness with light body and legs. It was fairly smooth but not syrupy, with just enough acid - a nice balance. The flavors weren't intense, but an interesting mix of pineapple, lemon and green grasses - reminded me somewhat of lemon verbena.  I must say, I wasn't expecting much when I bought the bottle. $15, and I'm not the biggest sauv blanc fan (I do prefer reds). But I enjoyed this one. It would be perfect at a warm spring picnic, or with a light seafood dinner. it would be nice for someone who's new to white wines, as it's quite balanced on all the senses and nothing's overpowering. A relaxed sauvignon blanc, if you please."
wine,32onhz,A_different_era,7,Thu Apr 16 01:41:37 2015 UTC,"2014 Ranga Ranga Sauvignon Blanc, Marlborough NZ, $13  First, I know nothing about NZ wines, nor am I much of a Sauvignon Blac drinker. So this took me out of my comfort zone a bit. I also didn't have a chance to get to a wine shop, so had to go with the limited selection at my local grocery store. What caught my eye about this particular bottle was the ""Certified Sustainable"" note. Not that I think that would make the wine taste better, it was just something I saw.  I've never experienced a wine this clear in color before, almost water clear.  I got big pineapple on the nose, just a really tropical smelling wine.  Upon first sip I was hit hard by the sourness of it.  It was undrinkable, and I feared I had a bad bottle (although it's a screw-top, so I don't think those can become ""corked""). But after letting it breathe for a little over an hour, I gave it a second chance and found it was mellowing out a bit. It was still tart, had a strong green apple taste with a bit of an acid finish. Overall, not my style of wine and would not buy/drink again."
wine,32onhz,dexcel,5,Thu Apr 16 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"I forgot to take a photo of the wines in a glass, but here's the empty bottles: http://imgur.com/3rjPS5W  Producer: Villa Maria  Region: Marlborough, New Zealand  Vintage: 2013  $15.99  Appearance: Very pale, almost clear yellow, slow legs  Nose: tangy gooseberry, tropical fruit, some rocks, white pepper? Flour. Kind of sour aroma overall.    Palate: High acidity, dry, no tannin, light body; Very crisp and fresh, with light flavors, maybe some pineapple, a little citrus.  Some green bell pepper.  It has a simultaneously metallic and mineral finish.  Comments:  A good pairing for sauteed tilapia and salad.  It would probably be nice with light, acidic foods in general.  Producer: Dog Point Vineyard  Region: Marlborough, New Zealand  Vintage: 2014  $22.99  Appearance:  Almost completely colorless.  Slow legs.    Nose:  Lots of rocks.  A little grassy, herbal.  Gooseberry.  Palate:  High acidity, dry, no tannin, light body.  Indistinct tropical fruits.  Some green bell pepper.  Very juicy. I want to say there's a little bit of butter on the finish.  Comments:  I can't help thinking they let a little bit of MLF happen to this wine.  It's really subtle, though.  Seems to be more mineral than the Villa Maria.    I did a little side-by-side comparison with these two and found only very subtle differences.  Not enough to justify the price difference.  I think I'd pass on the Dog Point and choose the Villa Maria if I were looking for another bottle of SB.  I've also had the Whitehaven SB before, and I liked it.  That's another one I'd buy again.  I just figured I should try some new ones for this challenge, instead."

Color: Very pale straw with hint of green in the glass.   Nose: Pink grapefruit and touches of fresh cut yellow grass.   Palate: I really love this SB. It's got all of the intensity that you would expect from NZ SB, but with acidity that fells really well integrated into the wine. It's still present, but not jarring like so many of them can be (and I love high acid wines). Deep and focused grassy notes and pink grapefruit and vibrant minerality with a surprisingly long finish. There is also beautiful lift and delicacy to the wine that reminds me of Pascal Cotat's Les Monts Damnes Sancerre.   If you get the chance to try this I highly recommend it.

These are meant to sit for at least 5-10 years IMO. The 2010's were beautiful, I'd call the GIII more feminine and elegant and the Sigaro a little more masculine and rugged.  The GIII for both vintages showed more bright red fruit and the sigaros were both leaning toward black and blue fruit with a little more depth.

wine,32ke2e,tkrens,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:44:33 2015 UTC,European here. What's the American obsession with needing to have grape species mentioned on the bottle?
wine,32ke2e,November19,20,Tue Apr 14 19:14:53 2015 UTC,"New World wines (not just north america) generally include the variety on the label because we do not have the 1000-year-old traditions of winemaking and the associated sense of place that European wines do. It has to do with the relative newness of our countries.   It doesn't make sense to label a bottle simply ""North Shore of Long Island"", because currently that doesn't say anything about what type of wine you're going to find in the bottle. ""Sancerre"", on the other hand, does -- because it has a very long history of associating that place with a particular variety and style of wine.   So while both Europe and the New World have labeling laws specifying what geographic area you can and can't mention on your label, only in the old world does that give you sufficient information about what's in the bottle. In the new world, not so much.  (Actually, we are just starting to see north american winemakers use labeling like ""Howell Mountain"". The assumption being that it is now a well-known enough site that the variety need no longer be listed.)  I don't think it's that New World winemakers or drinkers are less sophisticated or somehow need to have everything spelled out for them (which is sometimes the accusation) -- it's just the nature of labeling wine from regions that have only been producing it for 100 years or so. By 2515, I bet we'll have more AOP labeling like Europe.  Just kidding, we'll all be underwater."
wine,32ke2e,emily_08,2,Tue Apr 14 20:30:30 2015 UTC,My post mirrors what you have said here.
wine,32ke2e,emily_08,5,Tue Apr 14 20:52:05 2015 UTC,"I have a couple speculative thoughts, and I am painting some broad brush strokes here, but:  One could argue that educated wine consumers, European or not, weigh terroir and grape varietal nearly equally. Additionally, when you have generations upon generations of family wine makers in France managing a chateau or vineyard, yeah, the name becomes more important to the consumer than the grape. Not to mention that the strict AOC laws of France, in particular, remove the guesswork of what grape is used in wines from certain regions. For example, red wine from Burgundy is made with Pinot Noir (ok, and Gamay). Period. With all that said, the European consumer has grown accustomed to labeling that excludes grape (because terroir and who made it is equally/more important), and they may know more about the region where the wine was made because it's in their backyard (relatively speaking).  AVAs are merely geographical designations here in US. For example, while Paso Robles may be known for its Zinfandel, any Paso vintner can grow any type of grape they want. To the average or slightly above average consumer, the grape varietal can tell more about the wine than merely naming the AVA. This is the type of labeling that we have grown accustomed to here in the states.  Again... just sort of speculating. I personally am more interested in where the grapes are grown, were they from a single vineyard, etc."
wine,32ke2e,nmott,3,Tue Apr 14 20:18:43 2015 UTC,"I think this hits the nail on the head. I would much rather know that the wine I'm purchasing is Riesling instead of, say, Traminette. When anyone can grow anything it's helpful to have the region, then the variety, then specific sub-regions, vineyards, or blocks on the label."
wine,32ke2e,CondorKhan,3,Tue Apr 14 20:25:17 2015 UTC,"Why I prefer Old World style labeling:  I'm terrified of buying say, California Chardonnay. I have no idea if it's going to be steely and crisp or if it's going to be an oaky butter bomb. That it says Sonoma Coast or wherever on the label and Chardonnay next to it is absolutely zero help.  On the other hand, when I buy a bottle of Chablis, I know exactly what I'm getting."
wine,32ke2e,splashtonkutcher,2,Wed Apr 15 02:48:20 2015 UTC,"In the absence of the sort of ""appellation"" controls common in Europe, some sort of clue had to be provided about the contents and character of a wine. In France, you know the relative nature of a Bordeaux (Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot) and a Beaujolais (Gamay), but in California you can grow just about any grape anywhere (with varying results), so a grape label is a quick clue as to what to expect. This is catching on in Europe, especially Italy, where once-obscure grapes are becoming popular."

wine,32l661,Muppet_Mower,2,Tue Apr 14 17:51:55 2015 UTC,"Back Label  Good bit of sediment. I stood the bottle up for two days before opening. Decanted for 1.5 hours and drank over another hour or so.  I apologize that I didn't get a pic of the wine in glass. We were sitting down to eat outside and I was about to snap some pics when it started raining, so we had to rush everything back indoors. The wine was a clear deep purple going to ruby/garnet at the rim. It was much deeper and darker than expected for the age.  Upon opening the nose was most notably black fruit. After time in the decanter, it really exploded though. Gorgeous aromas of luscious dark fruits and some herbal notes made me think of blackberry brambles. It also had smoky cured meat scents and some spice.  Medium body. Medium acid. Medium + soft tannins.  The weight of the wine is surprisingly light for the amount of flavor it drops on your tongue. More black fruit here, with the typical Syrah characteristics of pepper and anise/fennel/liquorice.  I was kind of lazy, so we just grilled some lamb chops rubbed with coriander, cumin, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne. Sauteed shallots and spinach was served as a side. The wine and lamb matched perfectly. It was probably the best pairing I've come up with on my own.  This is one of my favorite Syrahs. Probably the best I've had from CA. It is drinking better than the 2001 I had about a month ago which was much lighter and more elegant. The 2002 easily has several more years in it. You can buy the wines directly from the winery, and I am pretty sure they have some library Syrahs for sale. I highly recommend them."

It's more savoury and earthy medium bodied compared to the big bold reds from Sth Aus.  I don't drink that many dessert wines but the one that rings to mind for Australia is the De Bortoli Noble One.   Some lesser known regions worth mentioning:  *Margaret River region is known for producing great Cabernets.  *Tasmania is an up and coming region for Pinot Noir.

I think it's worth it but only if you sign up for the Opimian Select. You pay around $100 a month (on top of membership) and they send you a selection from each offering (6-12 bottles). It's a really good way to discover wines that you might like to order. For me, I don't know enough about the wines to take the plunge and buy a case based on the 1 paragraph blurb. It also does nothing to help me get out of my comfort zone. With the Select program, you don't get to choose so you end up trying stuff outside your comfort zone.    Here's an example. Bordeaux is my favourite wine. I would buy nothing but left bank Bordeaux if left to my own devices. When the Bordeaux offering came out, I got 6 bottles through the Select program. 2 right bank red, 2 rose, 2 white. Rose? Wtf? Nope. Loved it. Favourite summer patio wine now. So this year, when the Bordeaux offering came up, I ordered two cases. I never would have figured that out without the Select Program.   On quality, I am happy with it. There is definitely stuff I don't like, but I still feel like I'm getting good value."

wine,32mbrx,guyleedon,2,Wed Apr 15 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"All of these are generally very good wines, which improve with age. They can be worth a lot of money too. Current retail price on that is about AUD1400 (http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/grange/1976)  It will be great (or sellable) if it was stored right. By this I mean it needs to have been in a temperature controlled (or proper cellar) its whole life. And even if your grandad has done this, you will not be able to sell it without proof and certification (usually only provided by a high end wine storage place).  So it's probably great to drink, but not sellable.  NB: Penfold's run 're-corking clinics' where they will take your bottles (of Grange), test them for quality and re-cork. This is both a way of testing the wine for quality for selling, but also for finding out if it's drinkable or for continued cellaring. See: https://www.penfolds.com/wine-advice/recorking-clinics"

Fresh dark chocolate, toffee, panforte, dark berry aromas with liqorice notes.  Concentrated and plush with blackberry, dark plum, praline flavours and rich, plentiful chocolatey tannins.  Finishes long and fruit-sweet with a strong plume of tannins.... Regarded as a great Grange vintage, but bottles are increasingly variable.

Alc. adds weight and ripeness but no heat.   palate of ripe black cherry, blueberry pie filling, and sweet peppermint. i love or hate cabernet franc for it's zesty green notes but nothing about this wine is rough around the edges. ripe bell pepper without a trace of pyrazine and a serious graphite/volcanic minerality add some interest to the plush new world fruit. slight black coffee and vanilla bean thanks to the french oak treatment.   another fun example of new world cab franc. the soft and supple structure reminds me of east coast US cab Franc. while the rich oak and ripe fruit show Argentina well.   this is a super approachable take on the grape and will appeal to almost any palate.  our retail price is $19.99"

wine,32gdcu,athyberg,4,Tue Apr 14 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"We have a few ""smallish"" wine shops in my neighborhood of DC.   One carries about 60 wines that have been carefully picked to cover a broad spectrum of tastes, providing between 3 and 5 choices for most major and a few less prominent varietals. Their wines are arranged by flavor profile, and therefore roughly by varietal, but certainly not by region (nor would they need to be). They also have some upscale 6 packs and do tastings daily. I fully expect that anyone who works there has tasted every one of their wines and can speak knowledgably about them. Clearly they are more focused on a clientele that appreciates narrowed direction in choosing a wine.   The other store amazingly has a similar floor space (~1500 ft2) but stocks about 2300 bottle options, as well as beer and an extensive selection of finer spirits. Possibly, only half of these are on their shelves, but most can be quickly retrieved by staff from downstairs. They have 8 wine consultants to help customers and I usually only have to wave 5 of them away before they get the hint! This is a case where I understand that their space/inventory issues impel them to try to help customers find things that may be hidden. And I do appreciate that they can discuss flavor profiles, vintages, and frankly really good deals; although usually I just want to peruse until something strikes my memory or curiosity.   Although I find myself going to the latter 10 times more often than the former, I can understand both their appeal.   Anyhow, while I wanted to show you my take on the polar opposite styles of these two, if any redditors are looking for wine in Capitol Hill, DC, there's a third shop it would be only fair to mention, this one falls into the more expectant number of options of a neighborhood wine store, but the choices are almost all excellent."

wine,32gdcu,MindTheVine,3,Mon Apr 13 18:53:23 2015 UTC,"Well if the store wants to go to the trouble of making their own description to help out their customers, I think that's awesome. There are lots of wine shops that I like a great deal that does this for their newsletters that they put out every month or so. They feature a dozen or so wines and do a staff write up... I think that's great.  But my issue is that there are so many tasting panels these days that no matter what the wine is, you can find a descent enough score, and just cut the best parts of the review and make it look flashy. I think this practice is the mark of a shop that doesn't trust their staff enough to make recommendations (just one knowledgable person on staff during the busiest times of day is enough for a regular-sized store). Also all those pieces of paper tend to look terrible. And therefore I look for stores that don't bother with them, or hand select just a small amount of their wines to highlight with them. Then I know that the store actually trusts themselves, and doesn't have to rely on random tasting panels to sell their wines for them."
wine,32gdcu,fairly_legal,2,Mon Apr 13 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree with your point about wine reviews, with a caveat. One of my favorite wine shops is in Buffalo, NY (Premier) and it is huge. It's a little like a Total Wine, but with even more variety.  Obviously, that can be overwhelming for a lot of casual shoppers, but they do have a few different displays and availability of knowledgeable staff to cater to people who need some help finding something or have questions. But what I really appreciate is that the staff mostly leaves you alone unless you approach them.  I know that whenever I'm in town, I can find both something specific I'm looking for or something new if I'm in that mood. I'd say 30-50% of their inventory has some sort of information provided with the price; sometimes a simple listing of scores or often a short clipping from a wine mag review. Either way, it allows the customer to inform themselves.  I get what your saying about devalued scores as they can be cherry picked, but unless I've shared wine with the shop owner and understand where their palate is, I would rather make my own hypothesis as to what I should buy vs. trusting a stranger's opinion.  See I understand that knowledgeable wine staff can be very helpful to a lot of customers, but I feel like I must be wearing an abandoned child tag when I am approached every few minutes with offerings of help."
wine,32gdcu,MindTheVine,2,Tue Apr 14 00:06:48 2015 UTC,Would you say the same about feeling like you have an abandoned child tag if you went to a fine-dinning restaurant and one of sommeliers asked if s/he could provide you assistance when they saw you looking at the wine list?
wine,32gdcu,fairly_legal,2,Tue Apr 14 01:55:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's a different situation. I expect a somm to be knowledgeable of every wine they offer and specifically how they pair with a very specific menu. Also, most restaurant wine lists are going to provide much less options than a store and considerably less information about wine is available from a written list. Anyhow, if I decline assistance but continue to be   approached every few minutes with offerings of help   ...I'm going to be put off. I've never had this happen at a restaurant though.  I guess most of the time I'm in a wine store I just want to shop like I do in any other store."
wine,32gdcu,MindTheVine,2,Tue Apr 14 06:04:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the organization. But I think this is becoming more of a standard now, and I don't think any stores except very small ones will do it any differently.   There is a store I heard of in Philadelphia that organizes their shop by style and flavor, not by region or varietal (though I'm sure there's an overlap) and the owner apparently does it very well.   One of the quickest indicators for me is I hate to see the shelves covered in ""shelf-talkers"" and marketing info with scores of all the wines. It's fine if there's a few of those here and there, but only for wines that have an impressive score from reputable sources and especially if the price is quite good.   I'd rather just see one or two people who are eager to help, are confident enough to talk about wines from each category, and don't seem intimidated when they are asked a question they don't know, and are happy to just say, ""I'm not sure, but let me try and find out"""

wine,32d7pq,jayman213,4,Sun Apr 12 21:10:37 2015 UTC,Theres plenty of high quality burgundy here in the states you just have to find it.   Also one thing to consider is who is making your wine. Producers have a huge impact on the wine. A 1er cru and even village level wine from a high quality producer can blow you away if you are not prepared.
wine,32d7pq,Desertcross,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:05:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure.  My first thought on finding it is that it depends on where you live in the states.  For example, I live in a state with shitty liquor laws and 3 major distributors who control all of the business, so the wines that my liquor stores choose to stock, even the big mega stores with the widest variety, are pretty abysmal when it comes to imported wine.  This probably varies widely state to state and makes all of our access different.  And the wine maker for sure make all of the difference, as wine making is an art. One thing I didn't learn anything about is the post harvest process, which I was disappointed about. I should've planned more time in Beaune as there was so much more I wanted to do."

wine,32d7pq,nrt,3,Mon Apr 13 00:39:32 2015 UTC,"Fantastic update, thank you! I had a question about negociants in burgundy - it seems they are much easier to find outside France given they target importers as a primary client base and deal in higher volume but I am always a bit wary of quality given the lack of direct information (at least that I can find) on how/where they are sourcing.  I personally always try to find smaller/better rated wineries when buying Burgundy but I'm wondering if I'm just uninformed and they're perfectly consistent/stable?  Also given negociants do own a lot of the vineyards in the area, are they worth visiting?"
wine,32d7pq,honore_ballsac,2,Mon Apr 13 00:43:40 2015 UTC,"Jadot and Latour were two larger names that I definitely see a lot around my home who both buy grapes and have their own plots, and so when we passed their vineyards I asked about them specifically.  Our tour guide said they actually make good wine.  Personally, most of the Latour stuff I've had is pretty well priced and decent-good.  I have a few LL's that are just labeled ""07 Corton Grand Cru"", which are almost certainly co opted grapes from different plots, and it is pretty great.  And 07 was a bad year too.  I think you're gonna see a lot of variation with more unknown negociants as some will know how to make great wines (ie Cameron Hughes in the US) and some will just throw it in a bottle with a simple, maybe americanized label and sell it.  The latter is what I feel is sold around me in the less accessible, more landlocked part of the US.  So to actually try to answer your questions, I think for the most part your strategy is sound.  Don't buy random negociant wine, especially ones that have labels obviously geared towards marketing or more american sounding label terminology.  But if you want to try a Latour or a Jadot where they may or may not have grown the grapes is a safe bet.  And I did not have a wealth of information on the different tasting stops when I made my tasting plan, as I tried to gear my one day wine tour towards places that offered Grand Cru tastings.  So the smaller co op places would've probably flown under my radar.  But if you want to just have fun and drink wine then any place is worth visiting!  There were a bunch of Degustation (French for ""wine tasting""?) places that we had to pass by just because we didn't have enough time to stop and many of them are ""gratuite"".  I will say this, all the wine that was sold in the wine shops and at restaurants were from local Domaines, and local producers.  I saw Latour, Jadot, and Drouhin and those were only in some shops.  There was no ambiguously labeled marketed wine, it was all from established local operations within the Cotes de Or."

I can't find where the clos is, but it seems to be a fairly common name as there are a few in other parts of France, and one in Meursault that seems to produce pretty good 1er.  The producer seems to be based in Savigny, at least in the Beaune region, which is like right around the west side of the hill from Charlemagne and Corton, and NW of Beaune, so I would guess that the clos is on the Savigny side of the south facing Grand Cru hill that Savigny and Corton share where Charlemagne is.  Haute means ""top"" so maybe the Bourgogne plot is at the top of the W side of that hill?  The top is a preferred position on the hill so there's that.  Maybe TMI about your bottle?  Enjoy it!"

wine,32e4uv,ourmodelcitizen,2,Tue Apr 14 22:47:18 2015 UTC,"Nova Scotia wine industry here. We are playing around a lot with traditional vinifera--particularly Chard, Pinot Noir, Riesling--with a lot of good success. But we are only recently doing well with that. The majority are still hybrids. We do a lot of Leon Millot, Marechal Foch, Triumpe d'Alsace, Lucie Kulmann (reds); and for the whites, Traminette, New York Muscat, Ortega, L'Acadie, and Giesenheim, to name a few.  And while foxiness is rarely spoken about--because we don't want to draw attention to flaws--lots of methods are employed to avoid it.  Here, the passable hybrid wines are made sweet or oaked, to help combat the foxiness. In the best red examples, they often use a ripasso method combined with oak to produce a wine that is has characteristics similar to an Italian wine--without the extra body.  For whites, they are often done to an off-dry method, and often don't appear as sweet to novice drinkers because our acidity is quite high, so it helps to make it balanced. As another poster said, just the right amount of sweetness helps--as long as it's not too sweet. Some whites in the right vintages taste great with a bit of oak, and come off like a baby Chard.  So why bother so much?  I think the reason we go through such length to avoid foxiness is because it appears simple. It's like you took plain grape juice and added yeast and fermented it.   Foxiness is what occurs when a hybrid wine is not treated with care. Hybrids simply aren't as complex as vitis vinifera, and so they have to be treated tenderly both in the vineyard and in the cellar to make sure they come out well."
wine,32e4uv,hughthewineguy,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"i've often wondered about making wine in areas where V Vinifera doesn't grow well, and what exactly the point is, if hybrids and stuff don't make particularly good wines...   for what reason would Nova Scotia want to make ""passable"" wines, using grapes that are recognised as less capable of high quality, when there's already so so much Vinifera-based product that fills that requirement, from Europe, particularly Spain and Italy?"
wine,32e4uv,ourmodelcitizen,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:12:09 2015 UTC,"Totally fair point. Making wine in this area is a 20+ year tradition and it's mostly just because people around here are so local-centric. At the time, why make them? Because we can. BC and Ontario have had thriving wine industries, why not us?  And that sort of thing builds a tourist industry. It might just be seasonal, but for a tiny province we bring a sizable amount of people here. And your average wine drinker doesn't know any better.  Also, we're not a rich province, and neither are most of its people. Hybrids are more reliable in the wintertime here. We have a very hot growing season, but probably some of the colder temperatures in the province in the winter.  But then people started seriously looking at our terroir and were like, wait a minute now. It seems our climate and soil is not too far off from that of Champagne, so we're starting to capitalize on that. We do the Chard and Pinot Noir, and there's a lot of good Riesling coming out too, along with other still wines. I took my WSET Level 2 last November with David Lawrason last November (pretty big wine writer here in Canada) and he told the whole class that one of the best Pinot Noirs he had anywhere last year was from Nova Scotia.   There are still more duds here than winners but we are definitely starting to be taken seriously and because of that, we are starting to work more seriously, too. There are a lot of producers here who are determined to become known on an international scale someday.  TL, DR; So what started out as a locavore endorsed endeavour that was good for tourism, in our case, worked out for the better. We learned that we are actually good at growing vinifera. We're still learning.  EDIT: Accuracy."

The photography is very nice, but otherwise there's nothing here that really distinguishes this blog from my own journal of tasting notes.   Some notes for how to get more followers:   Create more useful/specific content. Instead of just doing quick notes, write up a proper review of each wine. Interesting that the $6 bottle of Beringer has 11% alcohol, but, like, is it any good? Other ideas might be ""listicle"" type content (for example ""10 budget-friendly unoaked Chardonnays for spring"" or whatever), or writing about wine in general. What's interesting about rose from the South of France? Is it true that you can keep sparkling wine from going flat by balancing a silver spoon in the mouth of the bottle? Better formatting. This blog is not very nice to look at, which is sad for a website with such gorgeous photography. Better ""branding"". The blog title sounds like it's going to be about wines from New Hampshire. Most people aren't looking for wine writing based on what state the writer lives in, they're looking for specific types of content (reviews, informational articles, etc), or maybe a specific angle (California wines, budget wines, etc).  Show off the photography better! If this were my site, I'd go with a host that wasn't Blogger, and get some more photo-driven themes.

wine,3296e9,winemule,1 point,Sun Apr 12 06:43:12 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying... but here's a couple of thoughts: One is that not every bottle needs to be analyzed and critiqued, especially daily quaffers. The vast majority of wines under $20 are made to be gulped to quench your thirst, whether with your meal or as a social lubricant. They're crafted to be crowd pleasers with fruit front & forward.   Another point is that while very few ppl have the cash for $50+ bottles every single day, you certainly could afford it once or twice a week if you held back on buying these $15 daily sippers. Although it may go against wino doctrine, for me it's a sacrifice well worth making: drink less, but drink better."
wine,3296e9,guerochuleta,3,Sun Apr 12 07:48:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that reviews of mass market, fairly generic wine like this seem fairly pointless.  I also agree that the vast majority of wines under $20 are pretty underwhelming.  Having said that, you can find good, quality wine to drink on a daily basis for under $20.  It's not going to be in the supermarket, though, and it's not going to come from a vineyard that has big ratings from Wine Spectator or some other ""prestigious"" reviewer.  Look for wines with simple labels and no gaudy ratings stickers/tags.  Wine from small producers that are out in the field actually working their family plot of land, from producers that can't possibly make enough bottles to satisfy the demand of big importers/distributors.  These are the people that make a modest living making wine, and they know their product intimately.   Once you find one of these bottles, look for other wines from the same importers and/or distributor.  Importers that even bother to work with producers of this size are likely to have a pretty nice catalog in general.  I love wine too much to only stick with bottles in the $50+ range... so I spend a lot of time finding good wine at a more affordable price."

The movements scrape the agglomeration of yeast and bentonite against the side collecting the matter and hopefully the stuck lee.   In attempts to end the need for remuage two avenues were being pursued that I know of: one is to encapsulate the yeast into membranes which would then be removed at disgorging while the other is to encapsulate the yeast into calcium alginate ""beads"" which would fall to the neck of the bottle in seconds, again to be removed by disgorging."

But as more study was done with agglomerating yeast and learning of yeast's affinity for alginate (plus the costs involved with manual remuage - because in France, to paraphrase a Canadian wine commercial, ""We have a union for that"" ) the mechanization of remuage became more interesting. Modern selections of yeast can reform their coherent mass in between 6 to 8 hours even after the most vigorous shaking reducing the time between movements from 24 hours to 8, 7 days a week. So a process that would previously take 30 days (or 6 weeks of work) could actually be done in under a week, with each bottle undergoing the same set of movements. One of the first purchasers of the Gyropallette had told me a long time ago, that he was watching one of his guys rotating bottles and every now and then the guy would stop to pick his nose or scratch his ass, yet the other hand kept going, leaving some 20 to 25 bottles unturned that day."

Freixenet has a Gyropalette that can Riddle a bottle in One hour (ridiculous eh?). pkbowen, you need time with autolysis to get those delicate ""biscuity"" characteristics... the reason the bottle is left Sur Latte is so that there's more surface area in contact with the spent yeast cells. Also most Remuage is done a la glace... so if you turn the bottle upright without freezing the neck (or using one of the new beads, or other vehicles to assist in lee removal) they're going to go all over.

It was light in acidity and heavy in body. Full mouth feel and weighty. Medium tannins. The fruit that went into this wine felt like it had a high must weight and was definitely on the riper side.  The nose and palate were so similar to a really pleasant Napa Cabernet Sauv from a mountain AVA in a cooler year. It had very interesting, light and fun green notes of mint, eucalyptus and a touch of - I know it's weird - marijuana plant. The fruits were dark, slightly raisonated blackberry and current. Slight organic earthiness, forest floor and pine resin.   Actually a really enjoyable wine, not just nerdy!"

wine,3281ly,Martinsimonnet,2,Sat Apr 11 12:04:04 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  Lovely stuff! I love a decent Chablis!  I won a bottle of Grand Cru Chablis at a bottle raffle/tombola at work last year. The ticket cost me 20p and the vast majority of the wine that was up for grabs was absolute cheap crap...   I was very pleased to see what I first thought was a very decent bottle of wine... When I got home I googled the producer and  I realised how lucky I'd been. It was a William Fevre Les Clos. The 2013 vintage that I'd found online retailed around the £50 mark... Then I clocked the '1999' written on the label... This irked me at first, as whilst I'm very into wine, I'm by no means a wine 'expert' and considered the majority of whites best consumed whilst young (with a few exceptions), after some more googling, I discovered that some Grand Cru's are often at their optimum after around 15 years of bottle age... Eventually found a bottle of the 1999 vintage for £270!!!  I changed my dinner choice and chilled and opened it that evening, with a nothing ventured, nothing gained grin on my face. It was stunning! Quite deep in colour and exquisite subtle notes of butter and burnt caramel leading to a long honey-sweet finish. Gorgeous!   I strongly recommend getting yourself a decent age-able Grand or Premier Cru, if you have a place to safely store it. I'll be definitely be visiting my wine guy to get something to age for my 50th!"

Taste of honey, leading to fresh butter, and starting to get some grilled hazelnuts out there too. You can really feel the time spent in the barrel, it's very round and tasty. Then the acidity kicks in, bringing this awesome balance to a wine that is extremely interesting. I love this type of Chardonnay, and i am going to keep looking for more. Highly recommended!"

Also, if you have a good wine shop, keep your ear to the ground this year. November 2015 is the first time Chablis will be auctioned at the Hospices de Beaune."

You could always pay for pro wine storage, but that's another cost that will eat away at your profits.  c) In order to be successful, you really, really, really need to be knowledgeable about wine. Start reading, start tasting, etc. You have to know the regions, producers and years you deal in. It's the difference between buying stock that Mad Money tells you vs. actually doing your research and knowing your financials.  I have a couple of friends that do this.. i.e. they buy Bordeaux futures and sell 50% of it ten years later and basically pay for drinking the other 50%.

Seriously, we get daily posts from boneheads who think that they're going to throw a couple of bottles in their basement and then cash out in a decade for retirement.  Yes, wine can gain some value with age, but that really only matters to wine retailers.  They can charge a few bucks more for a 2011 than a 2014.  But unless a wine was valuable to begin with, nobody is ever going to buy it from you on some sort of secondary market.  People don't seek out everyday wines from private parties.  They go to a wine shop and buy what they want.  Even if you did have some sort of rare, limited bottle, you do not professionally store wine.  Someone who drops hundreds of dollars on a bottle wants proof that the wine is authentic (possibly including documentation) and that it has been stored and handled properly.  This means they want to buy from a reputable seller, not some schmo who was looking to ""invest"" in wine.  Anyways, wines are not all sold in their first year of release.  Wine sellers carry wines from a variety of vintages.  Which means if someone really wants a wine from a certain year, they can probably find it.  You'd be better served putting some cash into an index fund."

wine,329mhk,sean7755,2,Sat Apr 11 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"does the brand matter much, or is the type and the place of origin more important   Both.  The terroir is obviously very important, but that's only half of what makes a wine.  The other half is what the winemaker does with it.  Think of it like having professional art supplies, but instead of giving them to Renoir you give them to a 4-year-old.  You're not going to get a good painting.  An incompetent winemaker can screw up even the best grapes.   From dry to sweet, can someone list me 5 popular types of red wine and 5 popular types of white wine in order?    No, that doesn't even make any sense.  Wines are classified primarily by grape and region, not by sweetness.  And, actually, there really aren't all that many sweet wines anyways.  They're generally a pretty small subset of fine wines."
wine,329mhk,theultrayik,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:03:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. I guess I didn't get the terminology right, but I thought there might have been an order of what wine is more bitter than others."
wine,329mhk,theultrayik,5,Sat Apr 11 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"Sweetness and dryness have nothing to do with bitterness.  Dry means that a wine doesn't have leftover sugar floating around in it.  That's all it means.  Wines of any kind can be either sweet or dry.  The major flavor components of a wine are the alcohol, the acid, and the tannins.  Alcohol gives wine full body and a sort of ""hotness,"" acid gives it a refreshing and crisp tartness, and tannins are what give it the astringent, potentially bitter flavor.  Grapes start high in acidity, but the acid reduces and sugar increases (sugar is converted into alcohol later) with ripening.  Tannins come from grape skins, seeds, and stems (the harder parts).  Red wines tend to be more tannic, while white wines tend to be more acidic.  Reds also tend to be more alcoholic, jammy, and full-bodied, while whites tend to be more delicate, clean, and crisp.  However, nothing is universal.  For example, if you leave the skins on white grapes, you can get a more tannic product (orange wines), or red grapes fermented without their skins can create a lighter, refreshing, low-tannin wine (rose wine).  Sweetness is generally a secondary characteristic, and it's done on purpose, usually to make specific kinds of wines (like dessert wines)."

wine,329mhk,FergBreath,2,Sat Apr 11 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"My first instinct is always to say ""try everything,"" as you never know what you might enjoy.  However, starting with riesling, I would at least try some other whites.  For you, I guess I would start with some viognier, pinot gris, or unoaked chardonnay.  If you want to branch out into some different-tasting whites, maybe do some sauvignon blanc or a gewurztraminer."

wine,329mhk,square_mile,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:39:51 2015 UTC,"As someone who began his career with beer and has since moved towards wine, I think I can help.  I think styles of beer are much like grape varietals. You can have stouts that range from imperial to chocolate in the same way you can have Cabernet that can be dry and vegetal to robust, jammy and fruit-forward.   Beer often depends on brand; this is what makes the beer. You can rely on Stone IPA to be Stone IPA every time you drink it. Wine is different in that the winemaker (not necessarily the brand) and the terroir (this encompasses location, weather, soil and every factor that may affect the grape) collaborate to make the wine. Last year's Chablis will not taste like last year's Chablis or any other year for that matter.  As far as ""brands,"" like yellowtail, ménage à trois, barefoot, etc., these are your bud, miller and coors of the wine world. Carbon copies of what the public assumes is a representative for a varietal.  How I wrapped my beer-loving head around wine was to focus on one varietal. Do you like Riesling? All Riesling? Try Riesling from Mosel, Alsace, Wachau and then the finger lakes. Now, which Rieslings do you like? Which do you not? What makes them distinct amongst each other? Now move on to Chardonnay, etc.   Also, grab the World Atlas of Wine by Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson it is a beautiful book and an invaluable resource for about $30 on Amazon, cheers!"

Red Varieties you should try are Prokupac (Tannic red with a great body. Usually very high extract. Reacts well to wood) and Montenegrin Vranac (Since the split it's not really a serbian wine anymore, but you should find a lot of great producers). White varieties you should try are Chardonnay (they make a mean chardonnay, that reaches very high sugar levels. A lot of banana, tropical fruit. It can be overoaked) and local variety Tamjanika a local variety of moscato usually made very dry. It has an exceptional nose, great acidity and finish. Don't miss this one. Another local grape is Smederovka that is a very light herbal and vegetal summer wine. Lately some great producers are using it in more premium wines. Seems to work well.  Some producers and specific wines to look for:  White:  Kovačević - both Chardonnay and Riesling. Great body full of tropical fruits with a nice finish.  Cilić - Fume Blanc is a really great wine full of character. One of the best and most complex Sauvignon Blancs in this price range. Other Cilić wines are at good to great as well.  Aleksandrović - Trijumf Gold - Wine that won most of the local awards. Very complex body full of tropical fruit. Creamy and delicate with an awesome finish. Other Aleksandrović wines are great as well, but you should try Harizma and Trijumf Barrique (slightly overoaked for me)  Temet - Tri Morave a cuvee made from Smederovka, Tamjanika and Morava. Great nose and body. Very light but complex.   Red:  Jelić - Prokupac and Millenium Barrique. Both high extract reds with great value for money.  Vinerija Budimir - SVB Rosa. Slightly more expensive at roughly 35$ but worth the price.  As an outsider I think serbian wine made a huge leap into the future, and they are really making some slightly uneven, but exceptional wine. You should mostly skip the more expensive barrique versions because they are often overoaked and just stick with the basic wines of top producers. The wines don't really need so much oak, but the wine makers and public didn't figure out their taste yet. I expect big changes in the next ten years, but they are highly drinkable now.  Also cheap, most wines run around 10$ with the most expensive red cuvees maybe reaching 35$. Worth it."

wine,323fou,winemule,2,Fri Apr 10 12:04:25 2015 UTC,"Of course you can get those variances within a vineyard.  Usually, almost everything will get blended together at the end, but sometimes blocks can be separated out and bottled separately.  Example: Trimbach Clos Sainte Hune is a tiny from parcel inside of the Rosacker vineyard said to be significantly better than the rest of it.  Example: Corton is a largeish vineyard in Burgundy. It's subdivided into smaller sub-vineyards, and this come labelled in the bottles: Corton-Renardes, Corton-Clos du Roi, Corton-Les Bressandes, etc."

wine,3238kn,goodkiddadcity,7,Fri Apr 10 05:30:57 2015 UTC,The best option is probably to find a good wine shop in your town and join their club rather than a mail order club.
wine,3238kn,theultrayik,2,Fri Apr 10 05:33:11 2015 UTC,"I'd always been sceptical about Wine Clubs. I made an enquiry about the Times Wine Club here in the UK about 7 years ago and must've given them my work telephone number... They still call me at work every 6 months or so, in spite of me asking for them to remove my details. Still get annoying promo emails every now and then too, even though I've unsubscribed God knows how many times. Nobody likes that kinda crap...  I also think that if you have a decent wine merchant within a convienent distance, you should use their services. My local guy does tastings 6-8 times per year and is very knowledgeable and welcoming. Always prepared to make recommendations based on food choices, occasions, etc and isn't shy of recommending the occasional rarer or more interesting wine.  Having said all that, I did recently join Laithwaites (who operate in the US as well), mainly just to take advantage of introductory offer. However, I organised a telephone call from a 'specialist' after using their online chat/help facility. The guy went through grapes, regions, countries with me and we had good chat about what wines I liked, wanted to try more of, went well with the sort of food I cook, etc. I ended up buying another mixed case and was able to spread the cost over 3 months interest free.   They also have a good system for grading the wines you recieve and offer a no quibble refund if they send you a bottle that you don't enjoy. They don't seem too email intensive, which is nice and always seem to have plenty of offers on.  I'll continue to use my local guy for most of my wine buying, but will probably use Laithwaites to stock up for busier periods like Christmas and BBQ season.  Check them out."
wine,3238kn,alanfishman,1 point,Fri Apr 10 10:32:42 2015 UTC,"I'd avoid clubs altogether, winery clubs even are not typically a great deal unless you take satisfaction in giving your money the original producer. I use wine.woot for my buying and have quit all clubs. Prices are good/great and forums are genuinely helpful. There's not much diversity in region as 95% of the offers are California wineries. Prices per bottle range from $8 to $50.   I look at the site as a wine club that has zero mandatory purchases a great track record for quality and pricing that is very hard to beat. Since most of the daily offers are a larger quantity of bottles than you might want to jump on by yourself find a few friends who love wine and start splitting the offers up. You can try more this way.   And last but not least they send out sample bottles to community members to post tasting notes when the offer goes live."
wine,3238kn,Emperor_TaterTot,1 point,Fri Apr 10 11:39:42 2015 UTC,"I recently left the WSJ Wine Club, here's my story:  I have had experience with wine since my late teens, but in my mid-30s decided I wanted to get more experience with it.  The WSJ version seemed like a good way to learn.  They ship, I drink.  The first box is definitely a solid deal.  In the end, I made the same determination as you:  they are giving me drinkable wines.  But, I discovered I wasn't learning anything really about wine - wasn't really figuring out what I liked and wanted because they would just ship the wines to me and we'd drink them.  The tasting notes were somewhat helpful, but just not very educational.    In the middle of my WSJ experience, I got a copy of Zraly's Wine Course.  Started reading it and discovered that he had suggested wine tastings.  So, I went to the store and bought six of the wines he suggested (these were all white, because it was a chapter on French white wine), along with 6 (2 cabs, 2 pinots, and 2 blends).  I cheapened some of his suggestions down a bit, left a few out, etc, and in the end I got pretty much the same quality and price as the WSJ case (with a few extra splurges here and there, of course).  I was much happier with the experience of actually picking out my own wines and learning about then - even though the quality is probably about the same.  It wasn't just about the price, it was what I was getting from it beyond the bottle.  So . . . my comment is:  if you just want to get a dozen bottles of wine every three months, a wine club is a decent idea; if you're looking to learn about wine, it's not really interesting."

Slightly acidic tang but this is made in a very soft style.

wine,31xoxo,salliegardner,3,Wed Apr 8 23:38:16 2015 UTC,"2012 Louis Latour Bourgogne Gamay: Blend of rounder, lighter, fruity Beaujolais Gamay (85%)and cooler-climate Burgundy Pinot Noir (15%).  Definitely driven by the Beaujolais’s red fruit, but good body, acidity, structure from the Pinot.  DELICIOUS.  NOSE:  Red cherry, raspberry, baking spice. Medium minus intensity.  PALATE: Red cherry, white pepper. slight medicinal quality from the Pinot Noir, raspberry,  hint of vanilla. Medium tannin.  Medium plus finish; fruit on the finish; Nicely balanced."
wine,31xoxo,chapster1989,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:39:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a die-hard beaujolais fan and I really didn't like this wine. To me it felt watery, did not have any acidity and almost non-existent tannins and fell flat on the finish. A cru beaujolais can be had for the same price a in my opinion will be better."
wine,31xoxo,CondorKhan,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:05:54 2015 UTC,That's interesting; I had a v different experience. Thirty seconds after a sip I could still feel a reaction to the acidity in the back of the mouth. The acidity wasn't remarkable but it was definitely present and I wouldn't hesitate to call it a med plus. I also remember feeling tannins along the gums. I was quite happy with the finish; I thought the fruit flavors lingered nicely.  But I do agree that cru beaujolais can be had at good value; I recently had a Presidente Marguerite Fleurie and it's become one of my go-to's.

wine,31xoxo,GahMatar,2,Thu Apr 9 01:34:11 2015 UTC,"Huh. Me neither. Interesting. Here is an article I found from Decanter from 2011, which explains the background to the AOC's creation: http://www.decanter.com/news/wine-news/529412/beaujolais-in-major-appellation-shake-up  It seems like basically it was created so that Beaujolais' lesser regions couldn't keep producing Bourgogne Blanc and Rouge.   Two other things I learned from it: There's a new AOC called Coteaux Bourgignon (replaces Bourgogne Grande Ordinaire) and, also:   ""Nine Beaujolais Crus (all except Regnié, because it only became a Cru in 1988) will retain the right to use the label AOC Bourgogne, with restrictions. If the wine contains anything over 30% of the Gamay grape, the label must be AOC Bourgogne Gamay.""  I had no idea that basic Bourgogne rouge was/is allowed to use up to 30% Gamay. Kindof shocked. I've never seen that mentioned anywhere. Wondering, CondorKhan, if Sotheby's happens to mention anything on this?"

I always thought that basic Pinot-Gamay blends were just labeled as Passetoutgrains. Though those have to be co-fermented, I think (?). And, I guess, why label it as Passetoutgrains if you can get away with labeling it as Bourgogne..."
wine,31xoxo,kevin_k,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, those are the 2013 updates of the 2011 rules. So this changes periodically. The regional appellations are very, very political."

wine,31xoxo,Muppet_Mower,4,Thu Apr 9 03:41:23 2015 UTC,"Hi there, sorry about that-- that's my amateur tell. I was using shorthand (inaccurately, I see now) for the kind of lighter, younger, fruitier wine that I associate with Beaujolais, and for the traditional Pinot Noir I associate with the name Bourgogne Rouge.   But I should have written that it is a blend of Gamay from Beaujolais' cru villages Fleurie, Chenas and Regnie blended with non-Beaujolais Burgundian Pinot Noir. That way the odd redditor won't be misled into thinking that Pinot Noir is banned from Beaujolais, or, even worse, that Beaujolais is outside the bounds of Burgundy, leading that odd redditor to hitch a ride to the wrong location in the French boonies and be murdered by a serial killer with a thin mustache and a beret. I mean, berets aren't even French."

wine,31xoxo,kevin_k,2,Thu Apr 9 06:36:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it is hardly planted and supposedly due to be phased out by 2015.   People certainly don't think of Pinot Noir at the mention of Beaujolais just like they don't think of Gamay at the mention of Burgundy."

But by the time you get a chance to open it you will be either exhausted, already drunk, otherwise occupied ;) or all three. There's a good chance you won't even finish it, and a better chance you won't really enjoy it.  And whatever you do don't wait for a first anniversary, or fifth, or any other particular day when then you have to drink it. Simply wait for a day when it feels right. Maybe a beautiful spring day you take it on a picnic. Maybe you're both snowed in and stay home from work (does that happen in Iceland?) and you drink it while laying in bed all day and watching movies. You'll know. Don't wait for a ""special day"" - - the day you open will just, be special.   Enjoy! And congratulations!"

Enjoy it with your sig other, maybe with some favorite food and it will totally be worth it.  You could age it and save it and hype it up and it could be corked for all you know. If you ever build up a wine or expect it to be life-changing, you will more than often be disappointed."

We looked up the wine and found it wouldn't be good few years later anyways, so we have it displayed and bought a new bottle of the same wine to open at our wedding. We have some sentimental bottles from our honeymoon in Italy that I'm always hesitant to open, but knowing they mean something makes it taste that much better when we do."

wine,31x7wr,mdaquan,10,Wed Apr 8 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"That's too easy! Here's what's in my cellar, for the most part:  Red: Loire Cab Franc, eg. Chinon, Bourgueil, Saumur-Champigny.  You can buy $20-30 wines that last for 20 or 30 years, or even longer.  Baudry, Breton, Joguet, Olga Raffault are usually the most talked about names, and for good reason.  I also really like Dom. Guion, Dom. de la Petite Mairie and Dom. des Chesnaies, to name a few.    Also Rioja, like the Pecina Reserva and the Vina Arana and Vina Ardanza bottlings from La Rioja Alta, and of course Vina Tondonia.  I would generally not bother with American wines in this price point for age-worthiness...one exception which I really like is Peterson for old school Dry Creek Cabs and Zins, very small production, though.  I really like some of the less-famous appellations in the Rhone, too, like Gigondas and St. Joseph.  I always put Dom. du Cayron Gigondas in my cellar, every vintage, and it ages 20 yrs easy.   For white, we're of course talking about Loire Chenin blanc like Vouvray and Savennieres (though premox may be a problem) and Riesling.  You can get Kabinett and sometimes Spatlese level Rieslings from many of Germany's greatest producers for under $40, sometimes under $30.  Besides Sherry, it's the wine world's most ridiculous bargain and they age forever.   I don't necessarily think it's that much easier to find great, ageable wines at higher prices.  The vast majority of the Napa Cabs I taste are utter crap and top end Bordeaux isn't much better these days, whereas I taste tons of wines every month in the $20-30 range that I wish I had space in my cellar for."
wine,31x7wr,yofog,2,Wed Apr 8 23:31:37 2015 UTC,I haven't had any Pecina yet - is it worth checking out?
wine,31x7wr,andtheodor,2,Thu Apr 9 00:35:12 2015 UTC,"Oh most definitely.  The Joven all ripe black fruit, kind of brambly and peppery, think Joven meets Dry Creek Zin, but zesty.   The crianza is straight down the line perfection, what V. Alberdi always should have tasted like but could only wish.  The Reserva 05 and 07 are amazing, think Vina Arana with better, cleaner winemaking.  Haven't had the GR or the tete de cuvee yet.  Pecina brought me back to drinking Rioja on a regular basis when I'd been on an almost only cab franc kick for what seems like ages (he says as he's drinking a bottle of Baudry Les Granges '13).  I think it's now one of the top handful of producers."
wine,31x7wr,yofog,2,Thu Apr 9 00:47:32 2015 UTC,Recently read a very nice review of Dom. Cayron. This is definitely on the radar. Thanks for all the tips.
wine,31x7wr,goodkiddadcity,3,Thu Apr 9 00:52:20 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with Riojas. The 2001 Faustino I Gran Reserva is under 30 bucks - I've had a 20ish year old vintages and it aged beautifully.

wine,31x7wr,andtheodor,2,Wed Apr 8 22:14:35 2015 UTC,Geyserville is relatively cheap. I wouldn't say it has great aging potential but if you're looking for a deal on a case of decent wine it might be worth picking one up to add some volume to your cellar.
wine,31x7wr,Young_Zaphod,2,Wed Apr 8 23:14:46 2015 UTC,Geyserville is actually great after 10-20+ years.

wine,31x7wr,WesStrikesBack,2,Wed Apr 8 23:19:35 2015 UTC,Not sure what to expect with that one. It's a half bottle but there's like 10% RS which should help.

wine,31x7wr,stueycal,2,Thu Apr 9 17:24:17 2015 UTC,I've had beautiful Morgon with 15+years on it and it was excellent. Chamonard is one to age for sure

wine,31x7wr,Socrates5150,2,Thu Apr 9 23:33:04 2015 UTC,I have an assortment of probably 50 different Arizona wines in my cellar right now at this price point that we plan on drinking in 5-10 years. Most of them we've had at least a bottle of and want to see how they evolve over time. There are about a half dozen Arizona winemakers that are starting to make really great wines and we want to see how they hold up with age.   Also picked up several oak bombs on a recent trip to WA that I want to lay down several years before drinking.
wine,31x7wr,KnowMeBourgeoisie,2,Thu Apr 9 00:05:49 2015 UTC,Great whites to age would be Soave Classico and quality conscious muscadet. Pepiere's muscadets age beautifully.

Smooth and refreshing. Though, I just realized while editing these pictures that the bottle we bought was a 2013, whereas the bottle I initially tasted from was a 2012.   Most of the wines I tasted were from the Baja California region, typically from Valle de Guadalupe. These pictures were all taken at La Vina de Bacco in San Cristobal de las Casas.  The Rose tasted like any other Rose. I also tried many more wines at La Terraza del Vino in Cancun, but did not get pictures."

wine,31vftw,guerochuleta,6,Wed Apr 8 18:09:09 2015 UTC,What would you recommend for some of the best Mexican wines?
wine,31vftw,hsfrey,3,Wed Apr 8 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"Cetto is good, and for a bargain I would certainly recommend them as excellent wines for their price (I can get the petite syrah, merlot and cabernet and zinfandel for under 10 dollars off premise) and their nebbiolo is good, but not as great of a buy for the price.  Going up in price you can get something like the reserva real, and the Santo Tomas line which are about 15-25 dollars depending on where you happen to find them. Anything you can find from Adobe de Guadalupe is delicious, but my favorite is their Jardin Secreto which is a blend of tempranillo, cabernet, and Tannat, something that most are afraid to do. Torres de Alpha are good wines, but at 75 Bucks a bottle, they are overpriced for what their quality is.   The best I've tried that are available commercially are ST unico Cabernet and Enroque.    The thing I like about Mexican wines are that everything is so new it's complete anarchy, the Enroque is Nebbiolo, Tempranillo and Merlot, so you get not exactly new/old, but you get all regions of Europe blended together seamlessly. Or the Cabernet Tannat/Tempranillo blend that I mentioned earlier, Since they're still trying to figure out what works in the field, they're coming up with new and eccentric solutions to what works in a bottle that I haven't seen anyone outside of Mexico try yet."

It was very sweet without being cloying, had lovely soft acidity, and had gentle flavors of honey, peach, and tropical fruit.  As you can see, it goes for $25.  This winter, I was reading Seattle magazine in the doctor's office, and it turned out that this ice wine got rated second best in the whole state for 2014."

Uses  the same grapes as is typical, e.g., Vidal, Ortega, sometimes Riesling, and L'Acadie. Most hover around $30 CAD and that's with taxes in. Tough to find but if you do, grab it.  Examples are here, here, here, and here (scroll down on the last one).  You'll notice that most of them are sold out. Most wineries in this area don't go higher than a few thousand cases a year for total production and so they release new vintages every year with very little of the previous vintage in back stock. Just wait a couple of months and there'll be more on offer."

wine,31way4,benchley,2,Wed Apr 8 18:29:50 2015 UTC,"My best suggestion would be a nice dry rose.  They have enough body to not be overwhelmed by the food, but are refreshing as a counterpoint to the spice.  Sweet whites can also be nice with spicy food, but you don't want something too fancy as you may not be able to taste the subtle flavors over the spice.  Chateau St Michelle makes a late harvest riesling that sells for around $7.  It makes a great quaffing wine to go with spicy meals."
wine,31way4,theultrayik,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:55:22 2015 UTC,"What type of rose? Suggesting a nice rose is almost like suggesting ""a nice white wine."" It is just kind of vague.   I do think rose could work for some foods, and am genuinely curious what you suggest. Also, why not off-dry?"
wine,31way4,Muppet_Mower,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"Whoops, sorry.  I usually recommend southeastern France (Languedoc-Rousillon, Provence, Southern Rhone) because they're great value for the price point.  Also, I generally either prefer the body of a rose or the sweetness and delicacy of a white.  I don't like sweet roses because they feel like an incomplete idea to me.  I prefer to almost think of them as closer to reds, but with cleaner and more refreshing qualities.  A sweet rose just feels like an odd combination to me.  Of course, that's entirely a matter of personal preference.  However, it's also a lot easier to find a quality dry rose than a sweet one."
wine,31way4,theultrayik,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:54:27 2015 UTC,"I love dry rose wines, not a fan of sweet rose. But I think I might do something that has not being mentioned here, but after reading the everyones opinion it may work."

Crawfish, oysters(raw vs grilled), gumbo, grillades, and jambalaya are all gonna need something different. I havent really found a perfect overarching match. Good things to play with are Rieslings, some Cremants, Muscadet, Albarino, and maybe some Chenin Blancs. Match the weight/strength of wine to potency of the food's flavors."

wine,31u41m,nDQ9UeOr,3,Wed Apr 8 06:22:10 2015 UTC,"I concur with the others..... for college students I'd recommend hitting Sonoma.  Tasting rooms are typically open from 10 or 11am to 4 or 5pm.  If you plan to be in the area by 8am I'd recommend you start as far north as you want to go and work your way down south, getting closer to S.F. as you've been tasting.  You're most affordable options will be tasting rooms that require no prior reservations.  You can find lots of good feedback by plugging an area into Yelp (as an example Glen Ellen, CA) and searching on wineries.  I'll throw out a couple of recommendations that don't require an appointment.  If anyone in your group is into bubbles then check out Gloria Ferrer.  It's pretty far south in Sonoma so this could be one of your last stops.  For inexpensive Italian varietals check out Jacuzzi Winery, Cade is is right across the street and it's the same winemaker for both.  These are just south of Gloria Ferrer.  If anyone in your group is a Zinfandel fan check out Ridge Vineyards, they're pretty far north."

(2) Last year Uber was introduced into the Valley and has been a great option to be driven around. (3) If I were a ""newbie"" I would probably appreciate the education and tour at Robert Mondavi. A little touristy but great information and views. Then advance your learning with maybe Pride then Mumm for sparkling and views. (4) Mustard's, Oenotri and Bottega are classics and not on the expensive side. (5) Each Uber ride will be around $15, tasting fees average $25 per person and say about $50 per person for a meal."

But good stop between Yountville and St. Helena.   Mumm (sparkling) and Mondavi are great educational tours.   I would skip the castle.   4 Buchon Bakery in Yountville is a must go
wine,31u41m,justforflan,2,Wed Apr 8 18:05:02 2015 UTC,"Skip Napa unless you have time and money to blow, Get yourself to the Alexander Valley! The wineries are much cheaper and are a great value. If you are friendly enough most tasting rooms will give you a coupon to their friend's winery down the road. Last time i was up there i spent $10 on one tasting and didn't pay for another tasting until i had an estate tour at Jordan. Also there is a great lunch spot next to Hawkes tasting room!"
wine,31tmuw,g8g8,2,Wed Apr 8 01:44:34 2015 UTC,"There are lots of good whites and reds, but there's no real one answer to your question because context is important.  You'll want a different wine for different meals, for different weather, for different times of day, etc.    However, although that seems a little intimidating, it's not as bad as it sounds.  Just try leafing through some good materials and you'll start getting the hang of it.  Our newbie guide would be a good start.  I might also recommend looking at a good wine book.  Windows on the World by Kevin Zraly or The Wine Bible by Karen MacNeil are both fantastic (the Zraly book is a little more concise, MacNeil more detailed).  If that doesn't interest you, ask for a sommelier.  Fancy restaurants should have someone on staff who can make you a good recommendation."

wine,31tmuw,zombiegodzilla,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:01:37 2015 UTC,"Alright, since everyone else is telling you to educate yourself before buying I took a glance at those lists and they are lovely. I wish I had someone to point out great values for me when I was just starting, not someone that would give me a link to a book and ignore me. So, a good solid white... I don't know your price range, so it makes it harder but I'm gonna aim for bang for the buck.  So since I'm being a bit wine drunk, for white from Colicchio I would select either of the F.X. Pichlers, Gruner Veltliners from Austria, great food wines with a good minerality and vibrancy.  I haven't had time to look at the rest of the lists in depth, but that was my first thought. Good luck!"
wine,31tmuw,mckeanna,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:33:24 2015 UTC,"It's hard to answer this question, because the lists on restaurants like Lincoln and Craft are really solid. There's really not a bad choice on them.  If you want to get an idea of how to narrow down the list, my advice is start with what you're eating, then look for wines that will pair with that and fit your personal taste profile.   So I'd focus on gaining an understanding of what kind of wines you like to drink and how to describe that, then leaving it to the sommelier to recommend some wines. (They will always know the list way better than you anyway, no matter how much you study.)  That way you can sound smart without having to do a ton of studying. :) If you do want to study up to sound even smarter, I'd focus on wine and food pairing principles, that way if you want to narrow down your selection, you can do it by what goes best with the foods at the table.  You can say something to the somm along the lines of, ""We're having the (turbot/steak/venison) and I'm looking for a (fruity/savory/earthy) (red/white/rosé) that's (light/medium/full-bodied) with (low/medium/high) tannins and (low/medium/high) acidity.*  If that's too much, just tell the somm what you are eating and then tell them the name of a wine you really like and ask them to  recommend something similar. That will give him/her a shorthand of where your likes/dislikes fall on the above characteristics.   A quick top-of-head, very incomplete cheat sheet on these characteristics:   Tannin is the astringent tightness/bitterness you get from a red wine, like when you have black tea. Low-tannin wines are said to be smooth and supple; high tannin wines are said to be firm and structured. High-tannin wines are Cabernet/most Bordeaux/Nebbiolo (i.e. Barolo & Barbaresco); Aglianico, etc. Low-tannin red grapes are Malbec, Pinot Noir, Gamay (i.e. Beaujolais), a lot of Grenache.  For acidity, think tartness. Common high-acid reds are Sangiovese/Chianti, Aglianico, Nebbiolo; Low-acid ones are Malbec, a lot California Cabs & Merlots, some Grenache (i.e. Southern Rhone); Tempranillo is medium-to-high. For white wines, high acid wines are Sauvignon Blanc, Champagne, Chablis, Chenin Blanc, Albarino, Assyrtiko, a lot of white Burgundy; low-acid wines are most California Chardonnay, warm-climate whites like southern Rhone, southern France, some southern Italy.  For fruity vs savory reds, think California (fruity) vs. Northern Rhone (meaty, spicy); CA Pinot Noir (fruity) vs Burgundy Pinot Noir (earthy)."
wine,31tmuw,BougieFoodie,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:17:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly it might be easier to start out with lower stakes, drinking simpler/cheaper wines at home. I started drinking wine in college, and I had plenty of time to get a basic level of wine knowledge (what's the difference between shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, what ""dry"" is, etc) while drinking piles of cheap plonk and mostly just enjoying myself.  Honestly when confronted with a wine list I don't know well, to pair with a menu where I could pretty much be ordering anything, I will typically pick a basic grape/style of wine that I know reasonably well, and then order the second cheapest version of that on the menu. For example if I'm getting a chicken dish, I'll just order the second cheapest pinot noir. Since you asked for a white and also a red, I would use the same logic. Pick a nice basic example that is generally food-friendly and order the second cheapest.  A lot of people who don't like red wines like pinot noir, and it goes with almost anything that isn't either steak or the lightest seafood dish.   I feel like whites are much more individual taste oriented, but that might just be me (I only like fairly acidic whites and generally hate oak). But again if either of you know a white wine that you like, you can just pick the second cheapest of that style.  Also, whoever mentioned tastings is spot on. Just about every wine store in NYC -- even small neighborhood places -- has free tastings every weekend. If you want to learn more about wine in general, get in the habit of going to these."

I'd go there after visiting another winery or two, for a break. The movie exhibits will entertain bored children, and you can sit down to a meal or go for a swim (you can reserve a cabana or get pool passes). They also made a number of solid, affordable wines. J Vineyards has the Bubble Room, where they do lovely food & wine pairing flights. They also do cafe-style service of wines only on their patio. It's ideal if you want to sit and not push your way into the crowd at a tasting bar. Not inexpensive, though, but good if you're looking for bubbles. Wine-wise, I second the votes for Lynmar, Mazzocco and Dry Creek (excellent, affordable Chenin Blanc). Inman Family has superb Pinot & Chardonnay, though they're definitely not value-priced."

Closer to home, I suspect many of those disasters occurred during the last legs of the journey--on the truck from the dock to the warehouse, and/or on the truck from the warehouse to the retailer. I know of many distributors who have temperature-controlled warehouses but not temperature-controlled delivery trucks."

Personally, I believe that we have constantly tried different means and methods to make better wine- there are qualitative and quantitative (money) reasons for this.  I look at wine making the same way as I do for brewing.  I add isinglass, to make my beer clear (sometimes); other times, I will just cold crash and rack.  Sometimes I add water to my wort to change gravity to make it less alcoholic, sometimes I just say ""it is what it is"".    There are many tools for wine makers and brewers to choose from.  Each ""tool"" has it's strengths and weaknesses, some people choose not to use some tools (micro-oxygenation, acid buffers, fining agents, etc...) and some do.    The bottom line, do I think it needs to be on the label?  No.    Do I think it's a major problem in the industry?  No  Do I think Alc./vol. needs to be displayed?  Yes or no, I honestly don't care what the alcohol content of whatever wine I'm drinking is, it's most likely never going to be over 17% unless it is fortified, so who cares (I think there's a tax on alc/vol as it is anyway)?

For fucks sake, the label says more about what's not in it, than what is. By presenting the wine as merely 'fermented grape juice', not only are they undermining their own winemaking decisions (if they wanted it to be 100% natural, they would have let it turn into vinegar), they are presenting a false dichotomy which is becoming predictably typical of this little tattooed and spandex-wearing corner of the wine world. There are more than two ways to make a wine.   I'm all for ingredients being displayed on a wine label, that would be a great move. Some producers are beginning to do that.

I can see where this would not be a good business practice where a lot of volume is involved, but he'd typically make a few barrels (just enough to last him a year and give some away to friends and family) and that's it.  Look, my only point was that this (using native yeast) isn't just some hipster bullshit like several poster have claimed, but simply the way some people choose to make their wine. I happen to think wine is best when it's manipulated the least, that's all.  And at my age, I think I'm far too old to be chasing hipster trends."
wine,31qngr,snugglebuttt,3,Tue Apr 7 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"Is that an argument against using indigenous yeasts? Because some of the best wines I've had were made with natural yeasts, and I think it's a fairly common practice, no?"
wine,31qngr,nathism,7,Tue Apr 7 14:19:06 2015 UTC,Some wines made with indigenous yeasts are delicious. Some (I'm thinking in particular of Frank Carnelissen and Abe Schoener) can be undrinkable. (The difference between Frank and Abe is that Abe actually admits that some of his are undrinkable.)
wine,31qngr,arnaudh,4,Tue Apr 7 14:31:33 2015 UTC,"Yup. And he'll sometimes lose half or more of his production in his experiments. I like to try the guy's wines simply for his penchant for trying weird shit, but his label doesn't contain the word ""project"" for nothing."
wine,31qngr,snugglebuttt,3,Tue Apr 7 15:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Abe's wines have a pretty distinct character. Sometimes amazing, sometimes interesting, and sometimes unpalatable. His character doesn't come from just use of local/natural yeast, but from all of his wine making choices/philosophies(primarily a lack of emphasis on sanitation imo)."
wine,31qngr,arnaudh,2,Tue Apr 7 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"He sort of reminds me of Jean Van Roy of Cantillon Brewery in Belgium- no sanitation at all, and a insistence on the most natural product.  But in Van Roy's case, it works very well."
wine,31qngr,snugglebuttt,2,Tue Apr 7 17:52:52 2015 UTC,Those are some tasty yeasts indeed in the air at Cantillion.
wine,31qngr,arnaudh,2,Tue Apr 7 18:33:24 2015 UTC,You mean the winemaker actually has to rely on the quality of the grapes?  Wow. Who would have thought?

wine,31qngr,nathism,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"Using indigenous yeasts for commercial wine is actually not a common practice at all. It's a novelty thing only practiced by a few winemakers surfing on the recent ""natural wine"" fad.  Look, I got an interesting skin-fermented SB in my fridge right now, made by a winemaker friend. Using indigenous yeast. It's a fun project for him. The winery owner lets him have fun with it and they even bottle a few cases for wine club members. It's an interesting wine, but not something I'd have on a regular basis.  Interestingly enough, the practice of using indigenous yeast at a larger scale - for commercial endeavors - is only more reliable now because nowadays winemakers can send their samples regularly, for relatively cheap, to labs that can break down how the fermentation is going. They can analyze how the ""good"" bacteria are doing. If the ""bad"" bacteria is taking over, then the experiment is pretty much over. In that case, they'll throw some SO2 in there, and inoculate with commercial yeast. Or just lose the production altogether."
wine,31qngr,snugglebuttt,3,Tue Apr 7 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"Stopping fermentation then innoculating with commercial yeast after the ferment already started is terrible, terrible practice that is going to leave you with a stuck wine at about 2-3% RS.    On a very limited trial basis this could work, like bench trials - barrel trials.  Doing the work to restart a ferment is painful at best and requires 24 hour attention."
wine,31qngr,arnaudh,2,Tue Apr 7 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it's not like this is something that's fun or ideal. Most of that stuff is usually dumped if it doesn't work out."

wine,31qngr,arnaudh,0,Tue Apr 7 19:24:29 2015 UTC,"Found on facebook, of all places. For anyone unfamiliar, here's a link to the TTB.  Indie Wineries  Dear TTB,  As I hope you are well aware, the US (per 2014) is now number one in the world wine market, beating out France in number two. This is not secret or special knowledge, it is posted right there on google. Instead, also all available on google, Denmark is number one in the world for Organic food consumption. Copenhagen holds the official title of European Green Capital. This tiny city of 1.9 million people is one of the most popular destinations for food and wine lovers for the plethora of michelin starred restaurants, world renowned chefs, its farm to table nordic cuisine, and vast selection of wine from around the world, including a natural wine scene that can compete with the best. The attached photo is the back (front label for you Mr.TTB) of a wine that is imported into Denmark given to me by an importer friend in Copenhagen (the wine is, well was, absolutely divine by the way).  Now, I ask you Mr.TTB, why wouldn't we want to do a little better as the number one world wine market for our billions of wine consumers across the country? Isn't your job to protect the American consumer? When I buy any single product at the grocery store I read the ingredients before purchasing, the same goes for my non-alcoholic beverages. walking around any store, organic store or not, you will find that the majority of consumers are now flipping their products around to see what's in them before feeding them to their children and loved ones. Whey are we so hell bent and serious about keeping the ingredients in wine hidden?  Now, Mr.TTB, we have gotten all sorts of rejections from you, many have even made our 'wall of fame.' My personal favorite being to ""remove that suspicious looking shape on the label that seems it could be indicating something about the wine being 'natural."" The suspicious shape was a map of France, the country of origin of the wine in 'question.' I guess geography is not a necessary skill set for the folks we have hired to approve labels coming from other countries? We were not allowed to keep that 'scary shape' on the label. Don't even get me started on the certifying bodies for organic and biodynamic farming in Europe, and Mr.TTB's refusal to recognize the majority of them in the US, while many of them have much higher standards than our own certifying bodies.  In order to feel protected, as an American consumer, I would like to be able to read the ingredients that are in my wine. If the wine maker does not want to list them, then that is their choice, however, if a wine maker WOULD like to list what is in his or her fermented grape juice, I don't understand why on earth she or he can not.  I am not the first to write on this subject, nor, I hope, will I be the last, but I don't think I'm alone in thinking we may need to look a little closer, not only at the rules and regulations for the wine labels coming into the US, but also the people we are paying to decipher them.  Yours Truly, Summer, one of the many people desperately trying to get labels similar to the one in this post into the US!!"
wine,31qngr,ourmodelcitizen,2,Tue Apr 7 12:17:20 2015 UTC,"To give some more precise links, this is the TTB's page regarding COLAs (certificates of label approval), and the Cornell Legal Information Institute is a much nicer way to browse the code of federal regulations than the government printing office website the TTB links to (although that would be the authoritative source)."
wine,31qngr,nathism,2,Tue Apr 7 16:12:51 2015 UTC,"So, unprofessional.    They couldn't even bother to look up who the actual head of the TTB was and address an individual.   Plenty of logical fallacies   ""billions of consumers across the country""  ""Suspicious looking shape"" = ""scary shape"" (edit: It could have been an insult to their drawing skills)  This doesn't even go into the fact that if the TTB were to act like the FDA then every wine would have natural on the label and defeat the purpose that these folks are driving towards.  Now for the history lesson of why this issue exists.   This was actually attempted many years ago by the neo prohibitionists many years ago as an attempt to scare consumers away from alcohol consumption (even though that didn't happen to food) They did however succeed in pushing the sulfite labeling practice into being despite there being no link to a single fatal incident. The fatal incidents of sulfite exposure were tied to its use on salad bars for keeping the lettuce fresh. The FDA was involved and threatened to take over management of alcohol unless the ATF instituted the management of this. After the above the neo prohibitionists had a rethink moment and decided putting ingredient and nutrition labels on alcoholic beverages would actually be worse because then it would imply that alcohol is part of a natural diet.  That would be even worse so they pushed the ATF to adopt a policy that forbid manufacturers from having this information on labels, but did allow them to make claims like beer being ""light"". The TTB took over regulation many years ago and basically started from there.  There have been changes over the years but it is a slow and steady evolution."
wine,31qngr,ourmodelcitizen,2,Tue Apr 7 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you why many wineries are reluctant to do so.  I mean, sure, when your name is Ridge, and you've been around for decades, had a praised bottle in the Judgement of Paris, and you have brand recognition and distribution all over the country, you can take that bet.  But here's the thing: most consumers do not have a clue. Posting the content of those wines - the name of the commercial yeast used, the SO2, the water (yes, the water, for fuck's sake, like it's a crime to add Jesus parts if needed)... I'm not even going to mention dealcoholization, enzymes and all that other stuff. Shit, I remember having to use charcoal for fining with a problematic Syrah once. Imagine the horror of the vegan peeps when they realize dairy products or isinglass can be used to?  That's the thing. As long as consumers don't educate themselves more about winemaking - it's not like the wine industry is hiding that shit away from them (except for the jug level crap, but consumers of White Zinfandel probably don't give a shit if Mega Purple is used at some point to enhance the stuff they're drinking) - they would be more confused than anything with those labels.  Recently a friend was shocked to see the back label of a Ridge Zin. She loves wine, but doesn't know jackshit about winemaking. She told me she'd never buy that wine again."
wine,31qngr,nathism,4,Tue Apr 7 15:45:51 2015 UTC,"When some French folks I know learned that the US is the biggest kosher wine market in the world, and that a lot of it is sold to non Jews, I had to explain that's because people think it's better for you/more pure or at least they know more about production methods. Just like with kosher hot dogs.  I find this label ridiculous, but I'm definitely in favor of allowing more information on labels. Arguing that it's bad because consumers don't know anything about wine production is kind of putting the cart before the horse--they have to learn somehow."
wine,31qngr,ourmodelcitizen,3,Tue Apr 7 16:00:35 2015 UTC,I actually doubt most consumers of kosher wines know how it's produced.  EDIT: a word.

wine,31qngr,PetiteSirah,2,Tue Apr 7 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the thing - people go with the emotional rather than the rational. It helps filling our gaps of ignorance."
wine,31qngr,nathism,2,Tue Apr 7 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"It's not completely without reason--there's a sort of moral code behind kosher foods, whereas normally there are just consumer protection laws, which are actually pretty new as we know them. It's kind of like all branding; it's designed to give you information about a product in a small package.   It's definitely rational, even if folks don't know exactly what it means. The worst is when foods have ""natural"" on them, and other completely unregulated words. It seems rational to choose those over others. Things like that make me think the TTB and COLAs are a good thing."
wine,31qngr,PetiteSirah,2,Tue Apr 7 17:24:23 2015 UTC,"Kosher certification is a joke on the West Coast, I've had the drunk rabbi come in and certify at my work before.  It's more of a money making racket than anything about the consumer."

wine,31qngr,fox_mulder,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"Except kosher certification is all over the place. I mean, it's not like the Old Testament says anything about kosher wine. There is no such thing. It simply stems from tradition.  Also, while most kosher wine is cooked, nowadays the ""better"" kosher wines are flash-pasteurized. Do their consumers know that? Do they know the difference? I'd bet most of them don't.  Is it better wine because it's cooked or pasteurized? Is it better wine because no gentile was involved at any point during the winemaking, and didn't even touch the piping or the exterior of the tanks of the winery? I'm gonna be super edgy here and say Fuck no.  There is nothing rational about kosher food manufacturing, except for the monitoring process at some stages. It's just one way of doing it, and it doesn't mean the food is better, and it doesn't mean some non-kosher manufacturers don't observe the same or higher level of monitoring. A lot of folks in America have simply been told this tale that kosher foods are safer or better for some reason, and it's simply because in theory, kosher foods require closer monitoring during their processing. That's it. If you buy a reputed non-kosher brand, or wine from a reputed winery, the same attention to detail will be observed.  In fact, a lot of foods that are not particularly associated with the kosher diet are kosher-certified simply because of their manufacturing process, which ensures that for instance no insects got in there, or that they didn't come in contact with pork or dairy products."

Negrette (aka Pinot St. George) was mostly up-rooted in (at least in the Loire, still pretty popular in the Toulouse region) France- at the time that this was made, I think there was like less than 100 acres of the stuff planted in the world.  DeRose is pretty stand out- they make some high alcohol (now) big boomin' Zinfandels.  Their Negrette has always been a favorite of mine, in good years it can be very tar-ish, with a black fruit and earth.  Typically, they say to drink the wine within 5-8 years of vintage.  Some can last more, others, not so much.  I say, pop it and let us know (or me at least, I love that wine- PM me if you do open it!)  Also, if you're in the 415- the Cienega Valley (Hollister) is like an hour and a half from you; it is one of my favorite AVA's.  DeRose is right by Pietra Santa and Calera- two outstanding wineries."

I'll definitely let everyone know when I open it ... maybe add pictures if the wine after it's poured, it legs, etc.  I'm hoping to go check out the vineyard before it gets really hot in Hollister, they seem to have several old vines and it seems hardly anyone dry farms anymore.

Wine Grapes (by Jancis Robinson et al.) is amazing and essential (but pricey, $100+); other ones I like are Secrets of the Sommeliers (Rajat Parr and Jordan Mackay) and both of Evan Goldstein's pairing books (Perfect Pairings and Daring Pairings).  Also, good maps are really key. You could get some framed maps of classic regions, like the Côte de Nuits, Côte de Beaune or the Rhône. There's also a cool, graphic one of all the French appellations that's rendered like a Paris subway map, I forget what it's called.   Or you could give her a subscription to one of the good somm/wine websites. I like Peter Liem's ChampagneGuide.net (if she's a Champagne freak; it's incredibly useful) and JancisRobinson.com to keep up on vintages and trends as well as in-depth tasting reports.

So the wine is ""wrecked""- or is bad, by normal wine standards.  I know you weren't asking me, but I personally love Madeira and it's relatives.  I have found some great deals on the wines, especially Rivesaltes.  There's some old stuff floating out there (sub $100/bttl) that can get you pre-WWII vintages.

I have a birth year Bual on order, right now.. will probably pop that open on my birthday... Had a nice 1996 Sercial for my birthday last year.  Basically, everything bad that can happen to wine was already done to Madeira... on purpose.  When it's made, its stuck in a barrel in a hot attic for years, where it will cook and oxidize.   It was popular back in the 18th century because a) Madeira was a stopping point for ships going to the New World, and they loaded up with Madeira barrels for the trip and b) Oxidized, cooked wine does well in the hot cargo hold of a ship for 3 months."

I was only vaguely aware of what maderia was before tasting it. Defiantly something I need to investigate further.

wine,31qpfz,ferchristssakestopit,2,Tue Apr 7 14:54:25 2015 UTC,"Madeira is an amazing wine, both for food and by itself. First thing is to be aware of the basic styles, which go from driest and lightest to sweetest and heaviest (in order: sercial (mostly dry), verdelho (medium dry) bual (sweet) and malmsey (very sweet).) See more at http://www.rarewineco.com/vintage-madeira/styles-of-madeira/  I like a glass of sercial or verdelho before or after dinner, and sometimes end up sipping it straight through the meal, depending. Malmsey (aka Malvasia) and Bual are incredible dessert wines.  What makes it such a great food wine is that the wine has the acidity to balance the sweetness. That, plus the deliberate oxidation and maderization (heat exposure) is what makes it so incredibly ageable. In fact, vintage madeira has to age - by law - for 22 years before release!  There are only 8 producers left, as the vineyards on the island have been disappearing to development for decades. So drink up what you can now!

wine,31qr3j,fmondora,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:54:46 2015 UTC,I don't understand the question. What does bottle size have to do with aeration?
wine,31qr3j,winemule,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"I assume OP means that since there is less head space per volume of wine in a larger format bottle, it will need more exposure with air upon opening/pouring to open up."
wine,31qr3j,Muppet_Mower,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:54:14 2015 UTC,my question was: Would you be prepared to buy a 1 litre bottle  because the producer believes that the wine requires more air?
wine,31qr3j,Le_Grand_Fromage,2,Tue Apr 7 13:09:43 2015 UTC,but bigger bottles give less air.
wine,31qr3j,Laplandia,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:10:46 2015 UTC,"1500 is preferable. It is a standard Magnum size and it is mainly associated with premium wines. 1000 is associated with cheaper wines Paul Masson and such.  I don't understand more air clause too.

Hopefully they'll like to have someone who might know a bit and enjoys it. Then you could go for a trade certification (Court of Sommeliers or WSET).  If not that then harvest time is always a good way of getting into the production side of things, they always want people. It's just ended down here though.  Other than that, read books?"
wine,31q6ch,guyleedon,1 point,Tue Apr 7 11:21:10 2015 UTC,"I started in tasting/serving and then worked my way into production. You should have no trouble finding tasting room work as they are high turn over (at least here in the US). I found my curiosity growing more and more as i learned about wine until eventually the idea of ""what kind of expressions could i achieve"" could no longer be ignored and started crushing my own. A few years on and now i have my own urban winery label.  I would highly recommend starting with a small winery. They tend to be more willing in letting you help out in multiple facets of winery operations - and that should give you a good taste of where you want to branch off from there.  Wine Business Classifieds : winejobs.com will have listings of US and abroad companies looking for seasonal, part time and full time help.

I started doing it part time while I was in uni (serviced one store), and shortly after I graduated, it turned into a full time position.   I'm simply a merchandiser, but the pay is nice, work is simple and you don't put up with too much bullshit of the politics of business/deadlines to meet.

wine,31q6ch,balsamicpork,1 point,Tue Apr 7 10:55:40 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to that guy. Honestly, try to find a serving job in a place that has wine as somewhat of a focus. Having the service aspect will greatly help you anywhere. From there you can start your tastings and study. Become for familiar with the wines, how to explain them to guest ect."
wine,31q6ch,theultrayik,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"Even as great as you seem to be feeling about this right now, this is only a theoretical future, and it seems to be based on very little.  I was 19 once, and I know a little more about growing up than you do.  At your age, lots of things sound neat, but you don't actually know anything.  You're just starting to leave mom and dad's house for the first time and have no experience in the real world.  Maybe a wine career is for you, but you can't know that without some experience.  If you had done serving in the past and wanted to work on a CMS certification, I would get it.  If you grew up working on your family's winery and wanted to do your label, I'd see the potential.  But just being some young kid who enjoys drinking alcohol does not make for a proper start to a career.  By all means, look into somewhere to get started, but don't completely miss out on getting a proper education, and keep an open mind to other careers.  The fact that your possible wine jobs include basically everything in the industry show me that you haven't done much research anyways and that you don't have a focused interest.    I would suggest maybe serving while you go to college for something else.  Hell, if you want to do oenology or distribution, a science or a business degree would be a great start.    What I'm basically trying to get at is, until you actually know what these jobs are like, don't quit your day job (if you have one yet).  It's for your own good."

wine,31onj8,JasonSomm,6,Mon Apr 6 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I am not a salesman but I've been managing high volume liquor stores for just around 9 years so I am custom to their style of work and have become friends with a few as well.  1) Hours - It's a fairly standard work week (except for OND when all hell breaks loose), 40 hours, maybe a few less and a few more depending on making numbers, EOM buys or just a slow week and have accounts that are okay if you call in for an order.   I've noticed a lot has to do with your company and your relationships with accounts.  2) Pay - A lot has to do with your portfolio and who you get for accounts. If you got items that are pallet buys and accounts with pockets deep enough to buy them, you can make a good amount. Had a salesman making over $250K a year in sales but had one of the bigger portfolios and had LARGE accounts. Pay is generally fair for sales, see if you get a percentage on commission.  3) There's a pretty fair amount of trips across the board from small companies to large. Generally they are covered for travel, board and food, leaving you with any spending expenses. Maybe get 1 or 2 a year as for trips then there's dinners, trade shows, etc throughout the year. If you got some killer brands, you usually get first tastes on some really good wine.  4) Tips - Coming from the Retail Manager, I prefer a salesman that's more relaxed and not overzealous and pushy on items, especially items that there's NO way I am bringing in. Saying like ""Dude, John Blower's Cabernet Sauvignon has seen a 500% growth from last year"". Going from 10 cases sold to 50 cases sold isn't that amazing haha.  Come in with samples, try the wine with the manager or buyer, talk about the wine, keep it casual, bring a price sheet of course, and make it easy. Of course, still need to sell, so don't be afraid to mention, ""Hey, this is the 2012 vintage which did get the 92 from Tanzer and we got just 10 cases left. The top deal is 3, if you want some let me know soon and I can lock it out for you"".  Just do your job, don't be too pushy (still need to sell of course), and just be there for your accounts."

wine,31onj8,TeaGuru,3,Tue Apr 7 14:52:31 2015 UTC,"I made the switch last year.  I work for a distributor with a large portfolio of Beer and Liquor, with a good boutique wine portfolio.  I'm mostly On-Premise (90%), so that affects things too.   I usually work 9-5, but sometimes that's 10-6.  I also do about an hour or two of work on my computer at night.  I do about 10 hours of work on a busy day in a 14 hour period.  Many of my coworkers have sales calls before 8am, but being that I'm mostly On-Premise, many of my buyers aren't even in until after noon, so my day starts and ends later. I'm 100% commission, and I make a different commission percentage on different categories.  I'm incentivised financially to sell wine (higher commission percentage), as my predecessor mostly relied on beer and liquor in our territory.  It took about 4 months to go from base salary to commission.  I chose to go 100% commission, as I was confident I would be able to make more money more quickly this way.  At the end of my first year, if I hit growth goals, I will receive a bump in my commission percentages, which will equal a significant raise. My company has outstanding perks for sales goals.  All Expenses Paid Trips (domestic and international), Cash Bonuses, Televisions, Computers, Tablets, Gift Cards, and other stuff are some of the better incentives I've seen.  Its difficult to win these, as the tenured salesman are gunning for the perks, but I've won some of the lower hanging fruit.  Another perk is the massive amount of booze your personal bar will end up having. Getting the right job is tough.  It took me about 9 months of searching before I made the switch, and I ended up signing with a company I hadn't even considered at the beginning of my search.  Be hungry, nobody wants to hire a lazy salesman, they have plenty of those already.  Be organized, a salesman that lets things fall through the cracks is a bad salesman.  Never end your day early.  Even if nobody will notice if you cut your day an hour or two short, those few extra stops at the end of the day can make all the difference in new placements and growth.     Feel free to PM me with more specific questions, I remember the search well and I may be able to offer some specialized guidance."
wine,31onj8,blind_man_at_an_orgy,2,Tue Apr 7 02:57:41 2015 UTC,"Bare minimum is the 40 hours, no top people work 40 all at 60+. A lot of that time will be on phone, at home or office writing emails, scheduling tasting days etc...  Most companies will have the expectation that your customers can reach you during ordering hours. M-F 9-5.  % of sales. Depending on company usually 5-10%. Sell a million worth of wine you get 100k pre taxed. No think of how many cases a million dollars is. Top sales people in almost every company in good markets (major cities) will be making 100k plus. depending on the company...... trips, contests for trips, cash etc..., education, getting to meet with winemakers, expense account (dinners), wine events, tasting, dinners etc... It is all comes down to a few things   a. not all people can sell and close. If you can than...  b. outwork everyone, find the new openings first, be the best at customer service,  return phone calls and emails like a ninja, under promise and over deliver.  c. your book and route are everything. Find out what accounts you will have and what sales they did last year, the year before. Simple math will tell you what this will earn you. If a company is giving you no active accounts there will be very little room for you to earn, no matter how hard you work. You need a decent route that you can grow. Also find out about acquiring dead, deactivate and new accounts. Is it first come first serve or do they assign new opening  to reps."

wine,31onj8,frictorious,2,Tue Apr 7 02:50:49 2015 UTC,"I spent most of my booze slinging life in beer, but the way it works is largely the same. I started out as a merchandiser, then worked my way to off-premise sales rep for a large wine distributor who also had a small beer portfolio. Got on at a large beer distributor first off premise then on-premise sales. Made sales record after sales record for every place I worked. Then I worked my way all the way up to brewery rep for the world's largest brewer. I will let you in on one tip: Do not do as I did and burn yourself out. Take it slow and see if this fit is right for you.   Depending on if you get on premise or off premise sales, and the way your distributor works marketing, there is a BIG difference in work lifestyles between the two.   Off-premise sales is much more laid back than on-premise. That is especially true if you are in a place with alcohol sales in grocery, convenience, or bulk retail, because of store sets. In those situations, it is up to corporate sales to get the product worked into the seasonal sets on the corporate planning level. (that is high stress to be sure, I did that for a while. The sales burden was on me to get the product worked into the sets, not the local distributor) The main thing about off-premise sales is how well your products are merchandised and that directly effects sales.   On-premise is a whole other level of madness. Albeit, I LOVED the fierce competition and thrived on it. It is dog eat dog for on premise sales.   As far  as perks, it is completely dependent on your distributor, state laws, and main suppliers. It varies widely. We had choices between trips, cars, or cash for most contests. I ALWAYS took the cash. It is substantial especially if you are a salesman worth  his/her salt.   Now all that said, I was making +$100k USD per year. One day at an on-premise function, I had a certain moment of clarity. I walked away from the whole shebang that night. I do still miss it from time to time, though."

wine,31kicl,kgunderson,4,Sun Apr 5 23:32:39 2015 UTC,"I've spent a lot of time there from NOTL to the Bench, there's a lot of good stuff there. Konzelman is good (and usually happy to give out a lot), Cave springs can be decent, Strewn, Angels Gate, Organized Crime, Caroline Cellars, Hidden Bench, Kacaba, Megalomaniac, and Stoney Ridge to name a few.   Some of them are bench, some in Niagara, it depends where you are staying, but if you're in Niagara Falls the bike ride to NOTL is nice along the parkway and then you have access to a whole load of wineries there, if you have a car hit the Jordan Valley and bench wineries.    Almost all of them will have friendly tasting rooms, some won't charge for tastings and are very generous, the larger ones will charge a small fee for a flight."
wine,31kicl,quelar,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:28:10 2015 UTC,"Good to know. I won't have a car but will be staying at the falls is the current plan. Biking to NOTL was one of my plans as I am alone and tagging along on a tour seemed a little silly, but I don't know how open the tours are to individuals. I've done some tours where I was pretty isolated and others where I had a hoot.   I will look into the wineries you suggest, thanks for all the notes. :)"
wine,31kicl,quelar,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:38:52 2015 UTC,"The tours really depends on your group and your own personality. You could end up with a bunch of stodgy old folks, or a young rowdy bunch, really hard to tell. If you are on  your own and willing to kill yourself on this hill then you should have an awesome time.  I have biked up this. It's not fun but beyond that the ride will be fun.  Bring a big backpack for all your wine!"
wine,31kicl,andrewinereview,3,Tue Apr 7 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"In and around the Niagara Region you basically have two wine regions.  You have ""The Bench"" which is to the west of St Catharines and Niagara on the Lake to the east.  You will probably want to pick one of the two regions and stick with it for the day to maximize you wine tasting time.  If you're looking to do a bike trip I would suggest Niagara on the Lake because most of the wineries are clustered closer together.   NOTL Wineries of Note IMO all for different reasons.  They all produce good wines but not every winery has a bulletproof portfolio there will be hits and misses at all - Lailey, Coyote's Run, Cattail Creek (great value producer that will let you do a picnic in the vineyard for next to nothing), Trius (great restaurant attached), Peller (great restaurant attached), Inniskillin, Chateau des Charmes, Colaneri, Strewn, Southbrook (Biodynamic)  The Wineries on the Beamsville Bench will be a little more spread out so if you have a car it would be worth doing this region.  The wineries tend to be a little more ""mom and pop"" shop sort of places with a few mid-sized high quality producers in the mix. - Peninsula Ridge, The Good Earth (great restaurant attached), Hidden Bench, Rosewood (they make mead as well as high quality wines), Thirty Bench, Tawse (Biodynamic Winery), Megalomaniac, Vineland(Great Restaurant Attached), Featherstone(The owner uses a freakin' hawk for pest control), Stoney Ridge, Calamus, Sue-Ann Staff, Flat Rock."
wine,31kicl,PhoenixRising20,3,Tue Apr 7 01:17:53 2015 UTC,"Kew, Lailey, Ravine, Tawse, Stratus,   I work at one of the wineries in the area and after doing tastings around the region, these are the ones that stood out and had some really nice product."

wine,31kicl,spaceballs-1,2,Mon Apr 6 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"I had posted a few of my favourite vineyards from the ""Bench"" in this thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/31itdi/what_is_your_favourite_canadian_wine/  HOWEVER, without a vehicle, I would highly recommend staying in the NOTL area, as it's much closer than the Bench, but it's an hour (or more) bike ride from the falls.  NOTL winery map - http://wineriesofniagaraonthelake.com/bin/Map-SS2014_online.pdf  Bench winery map - http://www.20valley.ca/files/TVTAmap_2013_Map__Final_May_23_LR.pdf  Peller has a fantastic estate.  It's really beautiful.   Both Peller and Jackson Triggs have much better wines in their stores than what you can get elsewhere. I really like the JT Delaine vineyard Syrah. (Actually I think this can be purchased in LCBO stores in Ontario)  My personal preference has always been more skewed towards the vineyards in the Bench.  As such, if you can find a way into Vineland/Jordan/Beamsville, you will enjoy it."

wine,31imy6,vinoyvini,7,Sun Apr 5 13:23:50 2015 UTC,"This year I had a unique pleasure: I attended most en primeur events here in Bordeaux.  For those of you who are not familiar, the idea is to allow people to taste the most recently made wine and try to sell it now. This will help the cash flow, while the wine will continue its maturation in the winery, only to be delivered at the right time. So you purchase a wine now at a discount, and you get it in about 2 years when its ready. This also opened the door to critics around the world to taste the wine and make a preliminary evaluation of the vintage; this is something rather sought after the chateaux as they will set prices according to critics reviews. Of course, the most important opinion to them is that of Robert Parker Jr, who this year decided to step aside of the en primeur leaving responsibilities to Neal Martin. While the idea of en primeur is debatable, it was very interesting to see the interaction and the behavior of owners and critics/purchasers during this week. I will not of course get into details of each wine tasted (hundreds) but I will say that 2014 came out great. Maturation levels were optimal and complexity is evident. While I don't think this vintage will compare to 2010, it won't fall to far off and the wines that will come out in 2 years will be fantastic. Of all the wines tried I came out with some noticeable better ones (in my opinion) such Pichon, Pape Clement, Leoville Barton, Rauzan Segla, Lascombes, etc, and most of the St Emilio. Pomerol made excellent wines that will be complex sooner rather than later. Overall a great vintage!"
wine,31imy6,NOLAWinosaur,2,Sun Apr 5 13:38:07 2015 UTC,Better year for Merlot then?   Anything notable about any of the Beychevelle wines? I sell a few of those labels.
wine,31imy6,darrwin,3,Sun Apr 5 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"I would think it is a great vintage for Merlot, though towards the end of the season, we had a great indian summer, rather warm days so most cab matured well. I did not get much green tannins in most wines, not green or bitter notes. Beychevelle I tried twice.... simply great for now, we'll see how it evolves in the next months... They never disappoint!"
wine,31imy6,Le_Grand_Fromage,1 point,Sun Apr 5 14:53:36 2015 UTC,"I'm in the process now of buying some 2014 futures, came across this thread so i hope you don't mind me asking.    I''m looking at one of either: Lynch-Bages, Pichon Baron, or Pontet Canet for higher quality bottle selection and maybe La Chapelle MHB as a 2nd quality.  I could probably stretch and do Cos D'Estournel, but with the quantity limits it would be pushing what I'm going to spend.     Did you try any of these, besides the Pichon? And any opinions on them?"
wine,31imy6,CertifiedSnobby,2,Wed May 13 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"I was on the right bank last week to walk some vineyards and was subsequently invited to some of the events. I don't get en premier at all,  it is totally bizarre to me. Pure marketing and cash flow machine. Completely closed ultra tannic wines with full reductive power...  you can get a sense for future structure and any present faults and that is about it. Palate fatigue kicks in hard after 3 wines. Thank God for the token burgundy and lorie producers pouring whites.   At least there was nice wines to go with the lunches..."
wine,31imy6,tkrens,3,Sun Apr 5 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely correct. In fact there is something more to add to it. All the wines tasted are specific blends aged differently to have them ready for en primeur. So the wine is sort of fake. The only proper analysis is to know if the vintage was good or not, but beyond that impossible really know more.  And yes, this is PR though from a Chateau owner perspective it makes sense to bring cash into the books before the wine is ready. That being said, it works for the bigger second players, perhaps not so much to the top chateaux. In fact Latour pulled completely out of it this year."
wine,31imy6,tkrens,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:55:06 2015 UTC,"I don't completely agree, granted I've only been to taste the '13s but the concept made sense.  Can you tell every nuance of the wine?  No, but it seemed to make sense that you were looking for good bright fruit.  The 13's had been knocked before, but I found most of them very promising.  I will admit I did have a little bit different experience and was fortunate enough to taste mostly in private sessions along with a few other vintages usually.    However, still really cool, and I'm glad OP got to experience it.  I saw the cazabonne warehouse and got a little jealous.  I hope it wasn't my first AND last chance to go."

wine,31gwrc,1hewchardon,2,Sun Apr 5 10:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'd go for either of these two which would represent some value as most of the wines on that list are overpriced;   La Calonica 2011 Rosso di Montepulciano Tuscany, Italy $42.00  (would probably be my first choice if I wanted to keep costs down - and in case I liked it, I could spring for a second one without busting the budget too much)  Padrillos 2012 Malbec Mendoza, Argentina $55.00  I love Mendoza Malbec and this should be a good one.   If I wanted to blow the whole $75; Gianni Masciarelli 2009 “Marina Cvetic” Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, Italy.

wine,31h3mm,NOLAWinosaur,2,Sun Apr 5 02:11:58 2015 UTC,"Most beer you don't want to age. Beer (generally) is best fresh. You can age some Belgians, but anything American I would do fresh.  Edit: so long as it is over 9% the beer should age relatively well, but still most beers are best fresh"
wine,31h3mm,cherlin,2,Sun Apr 5 04:15:00 2015 UTC,"Don't go cheap. I have a couple of wine fridges, one was $500-$600 and holds 48 bottles and the second was about $300 with a 35 bottle capacity. Both are designed for wine with low vibration and temperature ranges from 50-66. Both have issues. The larger keeps the temperature I set of 65 for a few weeks and then resets to the lowest setting of 55. Not the biggest deal, but annoying. The second one won't actually allow me to set the temp (the cheap knob turns but does nothing) and keeps at a constant 50 degrees. Not ideal and too cold, but at least it's consistent. When I actually decide to replace these ones, I don't think I'd spend less than $1000. I don't know about you, but that's a healthy chunk of cash for me, but worth it because nothing would suck more than grabbing that 10 year old Burgundy and have it have spoiled due to poor storage. Sad story."
wine,31h3mm,Socrates5150,2,Sun Apr 5 06:36:54 2015 UTC,"A few questions to ask yourself. 1) collecting for personal consumption or investment. If investment then professional storage likely the best. 2) if for personal consumption, how long do you see yourself holding before drinking? 3) if being drunk in <5yrs then any cool , dark location without huge temperature spikes (ie basement ) will fine. If looking at 10yr or more then investing in a wine fridge or cellar might be wort it. 4) do you know enough about your preference in wine that you can predict what you'll like down the road."
wine,31h3mm,jmhemming,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:30:28 2015 UTC,"You'd be better off storing wine in a dark cupboard than a 'normal' fridge. Anywhere dark with low/non-fluctuating temperature & humidity where bottles can be stored on their sides will be okay. Vibration is also detrimental in the wine-aging process.   Do some research online and read up as much as you can on the subject. Your 'facilities' and scope for appropriate storage options will guide you to an extent...  I assume that you're doing it for personal enjoyment rather than investment, so do some googling around wines you enjoy that will age well and make a few purchases.  I've often thought about trying to age wines, but other than kitchen cupboards, I have no real storage options. And I'd probably end up drinking my prize bottles on 'slow Tuesdays', etc...  This is my dream though..."

wine,31h3mm,tadallagash,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:24:55 2015 UTC,"Do you have a home with a basement? That can make for a wine cellar? As far as a fridge I do not have a specific brand but would suggest focusing more on what space you have and how you plan on buying. I have always been able to buy 6 bottles at a time so I can taste as they age, but maybe a smaller fridge is better for you now and you can expand when you get better. Also keep in mind how much space beer takes up and if it should be stored differently then wine. Anyways I just got booty called and need to figure out how to deal with this girl."

wine,31er6g,GeolaRoo,4,Sun Apr 5 10:03:37 2015 UTC,"Depends if you want it to be good, interesting, cheap or prestigious?  If you want good value on a 'grand marque' - prestigious brand then head to a wholesaler - find someone you know with a costco or macro card and see what deals they have. If you want something more interesting, you won't be able to get great bulk discounts, but you can get some really good champagne from the smaller, less brand machine houses like Gosset, Billecart-Salmon, Canard Duchene, etc.  You could save a bundle and buy Cremant instead - Champagne Methode from outside Champagne. Will you and your guests be able to tell the difference? or could the money instead go towards some serious champagne for you and your wife on your honeymoon. One question I would ask is this: will you be serving 30quid reds and whites too. Champagne is great but often taken for granted and very expensive. Good versions of Cremant de Loire, Cremant de Limoux and Cremant de Bourgogne can be excellent."

wine,31e1rk,Martinsimonnet,2,Sat Apr 4 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"Excellent find! Exactly what I was looking for. Still, $250? They were quite optimistic thinking no one would try and flip them. I'm aware of a high end restaurant whose chef has flipped a similar special production wine from another estate."
wine,31e1rk,CondorKhan,4,Sun Apr 5 03:37:08 2015 UTC,I took a shit at the screaming eagle winery one time.

wine,31fktq,Meatballmeow,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"Gruet in ABQ would be a worthy stopping point, also some good breweries and restaurants in town worth hitting."
wine,31fktq,cmmatthews,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:19:56 2015 UTC,"Try Milagro in Corrales, just outside of Albuquerque. You likely need an appointment for Milagro. Gruet is also good and you can just stop in there."
wine,31dyp7,Ranger19,5,Sat Apr 4 03:55:58 2015 UTC,"The wine shop I work at is sorted by country/region. It still confuses some people, but a quick 'can I help you find anything?' usually solves that. We keep whites to the right and reds to the left, then organize by price point.   Our 'unusual' bottle sizes are usually reserved to one shelf within their specified region if it makes sense. I think keeping the sizes together is important, but having the quarter Moet next to a 4.99 Prosecco is...odd. I don't think size is as important as price point, honestly. At least in my experience."
wine,31dyp7,kissmybunniebutt,5,Sat Apr 4 04:04:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with your instinct.  Put the jugs and boxes in a ""Value Wine"" section, then sort the rest by region."
wine,31dyp7,A_different_era,3,Sat Apr 4 06:16:05 2015 UTC,"My local wine store goes by the typical model, old world by region, new world by varietal, with that week's wines (normally from the weekend tasting) right as you walk in. the only exceptions are sparkling and desert wine which are all grouped together regardless of varietal or region(though are sorted by price with champagne at eye level, and prosecco and cava at the bottom) i feel like this is pretty typical, and helps less knowledgeable people find what they are looking for"
wine,31dyp7,brewstah,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"I'd like to chime in a little late and say this is what I prefer too.   Oh and obviously red/white separated too (it's not that I can't differentiate, but I usually know what I'm looking for in this regard so it helps if I'm not sorting through red bottles looking for a white one.)  If you have a good selection of Champagne, separate it out from the other sparkling wines."
wine,31dyp7,oonniioonn,3,Thu Apr 16 00:20:25 2015 UTC,"Frankly, your best bet would be to ask a bunch of customers what they're looking for and then make a decision based on that. It might be that they're all interested in region, not variety or something, or that when you split the larger ones off it's confusing..  Even better would be to like trial run a few layouts, but that's probably unlikely to get approval."
wine,31dyp7,guyleedon,3,Sat Apr 4 07:20:38 2015 UTC,'My customers would have asked for faster horses' - Ford  Customers don't know what they want or like - on a structural or general level.
wine,31dyp7,square_mile,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. But if you redid the shop layout then got feedback on it, it would tell you stuff. Or if you ask them about what wines they are looking for and then set up the shop to enable that.."
wine,31dyp7,guyleedon,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"some sort of pseudo-scientific study of how easy it was for people to find wine they wanted etc would probably yeild better results than asking them if people thought the shop was laid out well, customers would at best be subjective and at worst think that a different layout would suit them better and be incorrect about that fact."
wine,31dyp7,square_mile,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:35:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, my poor phrasing is to blame - the setup you describe is the kind of thing I was advocating for. For asking customers I more meant asking them what types of wine they typically buy, so the shop could then be set up to enable people to easily get to the most in-demand types."
wine,31dyp7,guyleedon,2,Mon Apr 6 00:21:13 2015 UTC,"yeah I see what you mean. We (uk independent wine merchant) have Italy, Spain and France prominent when they walk in, our customers are hella traditional and they love seeing Bordeaux and Burgundy in Big letters!"
wine,31dyp7,square_mile,3,Mon Apr 6 22:11:03 2015 UTC,Ask the employees? I work in a shop and I know what's wrong with it and what I would do if I was manager. If any of the workers have half a brain they'll have some ideas.
wine,31dyp7,annonomis_griffin,2,Sat Apr 4 12:19:19 2015 UTC,"I like it when I walk into a store and it is sorted by grape and with that sorted by region. I walked into a store a fees weeks ago and they also created a $20 and under section and a $10 and under section.  They had the same wine in both sections, but he said they sold the $10 and under by truck fulls when they highlighted it."
wine,31dyp7,Jigones,1 point,Sat Apr 4 12:31:57 2015 UTC,But that's a bad thing for a shop...
wine,31dyp7,square_mile,2,Mon Apr 6 22:11:25 2015 UTC,"The stores I enjoy shopping in are organized entirely by region, and then by either varietal or sub-region within that (whatever makes the most sense; IME New World tends to go more by varietal, Old World more by sub-region). I find that some places segregate by red vs. white and some don't, and I have no real preference. Ditto price. Some stores I patronize segregate out the cheaper stuff in a specific area, but honestly I don't care. Especially if it detracts from the region-oriented scheme.  I'm fine with the jugs et al being mixed in with everything else. In most places that do this, they're on the bottom shelf. Which I think is an understood thing. And aren't most of them from the central coast of California anyway? I doubt this is going to be an actual issue unless your store imports a lot of international plonk.  I dislike it when stores have no particular rhyme and reason or are organized according to some obscure metric."
wine,31dyp7,sarasmirks,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:34:16 2015 UTC,"Geographically, then by price, cheap low expensive high. We find Whites and Reds generally organise themselves by bottle colour and reieve the overwhelming sense of choice you can get - as if theyre ruling out wines that arent red/white therefore not overwhelmed."
wine,31dyp7,square_mile,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"The wine shop I go to has two wine sections: - a 'fine wine' section, with local wines sorted by type, and internationals sorted by country - a 'wine' section, sorted by type"
wine,31dyp7,faceless-woman,-1,Mon Apr 6 01:35:33 2015 UTC,Organize the store by Region/Type of wine and then each section should be in alphabetical order by name. Then when someone asks for a specific wine it is easier to find as you can go right to that section instead looking all over.
wine,31dyp7,pazuzu38,2,Sat Apr 4 20:51:54 2015 UTC,"This is terrible unless the vast majority of your customers come in looking for bottles from a particular winery. As a person who wants to come in and browse and pick something out, how the fuck am I supposed to make heads or tails of a wine store organized alphabetically?"
