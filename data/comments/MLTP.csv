MLTP,3e62rq,chinaldo,4,Wed Jul 22 06:11:09 2015 UTC,"I think there's a whole lot less hate for Transilio than it seems right now. If something is in a very tight race with two other established maps, it's pretty apparent that people like it. I was lukewarm until the scrims I played tonight and I really am starting to enjoy it. The abundance of boosts makes for really fast paced play and creativity from everyone."
MLTP,3e62rq,manbare,3,Wed Jul 22 06:18:13 2015 UTC,"I have actually really liked playing it so far today. Good balance all round and the portals are really interesting. I was more frustrated with the whole process that resulted in it getting in, rather than the fact that it got in, if that makes sense..."
MLTP,3e62rq,dandeliondreamer,2,Wed Jul 22 06:13:25 2015 UTC,"As a player.... It's not bad. Granted, nothing exciting is going to happen that couldn't happen on a map like IRON. It's pretty straightforward, and nothing really outside the box. The community could have done a lot worse for good competition than picking this map, DEFINITELY not as bad as Gamepad  As a spectator.... These matches are going to be BORING AS FUCK. If people wanted to get their yucks in by voting this map, ya done goofed. This is as milquetoast as they come. And no, a bomb and two ""99%-useless-without-the-bomb"" portals don't make you edgy.  Honestly, it's a fine map, and I don't think it's unbalanced either way. That, in and of itself, sets it apart from most of the maps in the Tagpro-verse, and even ahead of some former mainstays in MLTP (coughDZ3cough). However, it just isn't anything to write home about from a ""WOW!"" perspective."
MLTP,3e62rq,Ballymandias,5,Wed Jul 22 06:37:26 2015 UTC,I have to disagree I think it will be very high scoring and fun to watch.  Also I would like to add that the portals and bomb in base are dank af
MLTP,3e62rq,king_jacobi,0,Wed Jul 22 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"I might come back to eat these words, but I'll be surprised if many defenses have trouble wrangling the bomb to keep flag in base. It isn't really all that difficult to counteract it's designed usage."
MLTP,3e62rq,Ballymandias,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:47:29 2015 UTC,"If not high scoring then I think these games will at least be fast paced. On regrab you can get across the map in 2 seconds, making for some really fast and exciting play."

MLTP,3e4vhr,FaithNHumanityStatus,2,Tue Jul 21 23:46:24 2015 UTC,oh look this shit is at -20. How bout that
MLTP,3e4vhr,Turboweasle,13,Wed Jul 22 00:50:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this is not a true representation of the community's opinion. This thread is basically just a ""Transilio shouldn't have gotten voted in""-train that many people are jumping on. Granted, the vote may be incorrect and another map actually would've gotten more votes but this thread here is not representative at all."
MLTP,3e4vhr,FaithNHumanityStatus,2,Wed Jul 22 01:04:00 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to hear your reasoning on what makes this thread less representative of the community's opinion than the other thread (and I don't think you can dismiss it as simply as ""people who don't like Transilio are jumping on a bandwagon"", as there's literally no reason for people to jump ship when voting is anonymous).  The only thing that actually changed for this thread is people were encouraged to downvote, whereas in the other thread they were told it wouldn't do anything, but I don't see how that would necessarily make this thread less representative."
MLTP,3e4vhr,FaithNHumanityStatus,3,Wed Jul 22 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"This isn't being given as much visibility. Gotta give it time, too. Also, since this has no bearing on anything people are less inclined to really care.  This could very well be a knee-jerk thread.  There's just more bias considering all that's happened.   Oh and can't forget the pot-stirrers. Those definitely fuzz things"
MLTP,3e4vhr,Dinosawyerr,0,Wed Jul 22 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"This isn't being given as much visibility.   It's the third post on a sub that rarely gets more than one or two submissions per day.  It's got as much visibility as the first thread did, really.   Gotta give it time, too.   Obviously, but I don't see how that detracts from its legitimacy as a representation of the community.   Also, since this has no bearing on anything people are less inclined to really care.   How would they be less inclined to care about this than the previous thread?  It's the same level of commitment necessary to express their opinion.  If anything you'd probably prefer that only people who do actually care vote, since they'll be the ones pissed off the most if a relatively apathetic majority gets their way to the dismay of those who care.   This could very well be a knee-jerk thread.   Granted, but how does that delegitimize it?   There's just more bias considering all that's happened.   Isn't bias the point of a vote though?  People are going to vote for the maps they prefer and against the maps they don't.  Not sure that you can have what is essentially a popularity contest without people voting in line with their biases."
MLTP,3e4vhr,Turboweasle,2,Wed Jul 22 01:29:01 2015 UTC,"Visibility meaning it's not cross posted to the main. There's no telling how many non players voted for what.   They're less inclined because they've already put that time in.  This one literally has no official capacity so why bother? It takes two seconds yea, but don't underestimate people's laziness or overestimate their commitment to the minutiae of the league.  While yes it'd be great to see how the people that DO care actually voted, we know that's not ultimately how the voting is decided. So this actually doesn't show much other than yes transilio was not preferred by a portion of the players. It doesn't account for everything else mentioned."
MLTP,3e4vhr,2tyrodnazc,-1,Wed Jul 22 01:41:56 2015 UTC,"Visibility meaning it's not cross posted to the main. There's no telling how many non players voted for what.   I hadn't considered that, good point.  That could easily be rectified, though.   They're less inclined because they've already put that time in.   ""That time"" being less than a minute?  I'm sorry, I just don't see this as a compelling argument for this thread not being representative of the community.  And I think the point where I may be diverging from your arguments is that I consider the community part of ""community's choice"" to be the MLTP community, not the greater Tagpro community.  The MLTP community is the players and those who watch the streams or are otherwise invested.  The greater TagPro community isn't really part of the MLTP community (except for the obvious overlap of playing/participating in MLTP in some capacity).  From that perspective I think it makes sense that this thread should be considered just as legitimate, although I definitely understand it falling short of that if you include the greater TagPro community to be the intended target for a community vote."
MLTP,3e4vhr,Ballymandias,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"Yea I feel ya. I always understood it to be the greater tagpro community. Hence it always being promoted on the main sub.  I still think there are people who only feel compelled to vote that one time. There are a lot who do,  but possibly a considerable amount that don't. Also, I didn't mean that ""giving it time"" detracts from its legitimacy at all. Just that time will tell if the transilio supporters come out to participate."
MLTP,3e4vhr,Dinosawyerr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:02:22 2015 UTC,"Also, I think the competitive communities could still get a vote if we simply included a map selection on the sign up sheet. Two maps you like and the entire competitive community gets representation. They're already double checking for smurfs etc so you know you're getting a one person two vote situation. No need to worry about reddit contest mode or extra signups etc. And it would be optional. Don't care about the map vote? No worries. Don't bother because the ones that do care will vote. The only downside is the midseason map thread additions.   AND teams know well in advance what the voted map is so you can practice in a reasonable time frame"

MLTP,3e4vhr,ndprice,-1,Wed Jul 22 01:18:21 2015 UTC,"Why would they not?  It isn't as if it's a large time commitment or anything, and voting again to prove that they're in the majority (and thus that the original thread was legitimately what the community wanted) would shut a lot of people up."
MLTP,3e4vhr,NeonAura,12,Wed Jul 22 01:20:04 2015 UTC,"to put it bluntly: the reason it's not going to have the same voters is because it's not going to change anything and nobody's really going to bother going to put an effort into what they already know is a circlejerk thread where transilio in particular will be downvoted  there's so much wrong with this thread that I honestly don't know where to begin, but here is a quick few points:   dino's point people particularly bitter about the transilio decision will have a vested interest to downvote transilio in particular, and to be perfectly honest I'm of the opinion that anyone who doesn't see this point is either lying or incredibly naive as this thread will have literally no impact on any results, there's less incentive for people to vote in general unless you're a bitter betsy about transilio speaking of bitter betsies, they have that vested interest to be able to confidently say ""HA our poll is more correct"" when the thread author isn't even willing to subject it to the same conditions as the other thread, and thus isn't going to be the exact same factor as the original thread anyways. I don't think a choice of five maps compares to a choice of at least 20, especially when it's not in contest mode.   and now here's my opinions   (opinion as a commissioner): I've dropped the ball the last ~2 weeks and haven't been on as much in general in favor of ""doing a dece amount of other shit"", so I will take part responsibility for not being on the ball and seeing the week 7-8 thing coming up (opinion as a player) transilio is the meh-est of maps (opinion as a commissioner) despite it being the meh-est of maps, there's no getting around the fact that it was at the very least a top 3 map in votes, and probably had the same distribution of upvotes to downvotes as last season's community map had (TWP). Trying to look at this -20 points and trying to say that it would have gone the same as on the thread is incredibly silly considering how close the votes were (for the top 3 maps) for the past however many hours. (opinion as a player) Speaking of TWP, everyone seems to forget how shit-pants angry they got at the thought of a seemingly-goofy map entering rotation over the established GeoKoala, but then they played it and apparently liked it enough that they felt it needed to be in this season too. I'm not saying the same thing will happen over Transilio, but I'm pretty sure there were some major complainers about TWP when it was first announced as a community map as well. I think it's funny that this would practically be a run-off vote if it ever counted, especially considering the thread maker's only posted maps were the top three maps of the last thread instead of the entirety of the maps from the last thread."
MLTP,3e4vhr,arjuna9,3,Wed Jul 22 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you biting the bullet as a commish on the community map deal. It seems that every commish response that I've seen before this doesn't acknowledge the fact that there was a problem in having the vote delayed so much. You take ownership of the problem, saying that it would have been done differently had you been fully engaged. Respect."

MLTP,3dyi3v,king_jacobi,3,Mon Jul 20 17:16:12 2015 UTC,"unfortunately those are also two features which really only ""work"" on giant and chasey maps (i.e. where they aren't OP and have room to be implemented)."

MLTP,3dwnjj,knowak04,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:28:57 2015 UTC,genuine question from a learning standpoint- what did you do wrong to let them cap that much in such a small time frame? what could you have done better or differently to stop it?
MLTP,3dwnjj,Jimmy_The_Explorer,5,Mon Jul 20 04:42:13 2015 UTC,"I've been going over it actually and can piece it together based on the analytics even though there was no stream.   Ash spikes, I kill their FC who had tagpro. Their regrab rushes mid. Xile is in their base being blocked by Quarky and Fronj.  I'm not sure where Legman is on this one, but he has a tagpro so I'm guessing he wasn't in position to make a play or he would've.  Their tagpro spawns and kills Xile.  Legman's tagpro powers down. Their regrab comes in. Their tagpro powers down, but I get blocked out and Legman was a split second behind, probably zoned by their tagpro since it had more time than his did. I can't tell where Ash was, he might have been zoned out by the tagpro. Leg grabs half a second after their cap trying to get the return and gets returned himself. Xile spawns three seconds before their regrab and might not be ahead. Ash doesn't have an entry around there so it's hard to tell, but based on some later ones I think he's in their base. I misplay and try to use the left bomb to get to their base quicker but Ash is unable to hold for long enough for me to get there. I grab a half-second after he caps trying to get the return and die immediately (the bomb turned out to be a bad call for this reason). Their regrab is ahead of me, with Ash and Legman being in the other base. Xile is waiting to see where their FC is and their FC gets ahead of him. Their FC boosts into base, and Legman grabs to delay the cap and is immediately returned, but buying enough time for their FC to be in their corner. Ash gets space to grab off of Legman's grab and tries to kiss him in the corner.  I'm there by this time and a slightly above their FC playing a frantic contain. Unfortunately, they return Ash before he can kiss, which poosts me out of position.   ----------------1 MINUTE BREAK--------------------   1 later I get returned on an actual legitimate hold thank god. Xile returns their FC, Legman grabs, Xile goes to regrab. I spawn a second before their regrab grabs, so I might have spawned behind or gotten juked.  Xile is either trying to buy time or isn't prepared for Legman to die at that moment, and grabs and dies. Ash spikes on the double spikes mid going into their base, but he wasn't going to get there before the cap anyway based on the fact he wasn't on boost side of the spikes. I'm too late to stop the cap.   --------ANOTHER SLIGHT BREAK---------   Legman kisses the enemy FC at the entrance of their base. I'm on regrab and Ash is also in their base as he was chasing their FC. I grab and run out through the right, and Ash goes to regrab. I get returned right by a defender as I leave base. Ash grabs and tries to get out right, but gets returned by the other defender. Legman arrives again, and Xile and Legman try to stop the cap. Legman grabs and kisses the FC. Ash and I arrive back again. Legman goes to get a pup, but somehow Ash, Xile, and I misplay and all get blocked out by the two defenders and they cap.  Xile misses stopping the cap by a few milliseconds, so he grabs and is immediately returned. Legman comes in with a rolling bomb. Ash blocks and I grab to buy Legman space to get out, but they defuse him and blast off it into me. We find to where their FC is approaching from too late and Ash and Legman are unable to shed the blocks in time.   --------A minute or so --------  We score two WOOOOOOO!"

MLTP,3dwnjj,Jimmy_The_Explorer,4,Mon Jul 20 04:44:56 2015 UTC,"It's the fact that our O/D was so bad that half that we were constantly a few milliseconds behind the play. It wasn't so bad that you'd cap uncontested, but we'd be SO CLOSE to stopping it, but then get returned since we were like 20 milliseconds late. And the same thing would happen the next time. And the next. The FC would get past our chaser, already be past our guy that died, and then we'd get blocked out or have to grab and kiss, which would put us a man down again.   The first cap that started the train was just a good play on your part when we had a small misplay. We should've started the prevent after probably the second cap though, as at that point it was clear we were so far on the back foot. Oh well, live and learn :/"

Now that I'm mostly done with that, I'm gonna work with the other leaders to push through our initial backlog of scripts to approve. Once that's done, the process should be very smooth.  5: Yes, any script not on the whitelist will be detected.

That is to say, will we have to submit every tiles.png, every standard boost file, every red boost file, every blue boost file, every portal, every splat?  I change my texture pack whenever I feel like it, always when I stream, so I'm concerned this will be a hell of a lot of work.  And the reality is, as far as I know, that the actual image files couldn't allow you to cheat in any way.    Implication in a previous modmail seemed to be that we'd need to submit our texture packs, but to be honest, I think that's utterly absurd."

No.   As of the time of this post, the whitelist still hasn't been updated with new scripts. When will it be updated?   Lol no idea I'm not no that team.   Will we be notified if any of our script submissions are declined?   I'd assume so.   ""Each league has nominated a representative to review script submissions."" Who is in charge of accepting scripts and adding them to the whitelist for MLTP?   I think it's Bull (not sure though).   Will we be flagged/detected for using any scripts not on the whitelist, no matter how benign they are? For example, if the whitelist were to go into effect tonight and I played with one of my scripts enabled that's not yet on it--say, the ""Rolling 300 Timeline"" script--would that flag me in the same way that someone using an illicit powerup timer would be flagged, or are these cases able to be differentiated?   I can't go into details, but I just want to say that either way you'd want to avoid using a script not on the list.   Why are we switching from the previous system to this new system?   The new system is much, much better at actually catching cheaters."

People hate on them because of the tedium of constantly chasing and the ease of maintaining a regrab train. But a regrab train on this map could be a lot more tenuous. A defender could come by and activate one of the bomb and pop the regrabber or the regrabber would have to stand off the flag , giving the defense time to recoup and stifle the regrab. Also, get good at chasing. Defenses should be challenged, also. The base is far and away the most unique on in rotation. The bombs are equally useful for defense and offenses and interesting combinations could result in caps. They also aren't nearly as chaotic as the bombs on TWP, giving people more control over what's happening on the map. The map rewards skilled boosting more than any other map. There're a lot of ways to mess it up and get caught with no momentum but if you pull them off correctly and the defenses are out of position, you're past two very easily. Forces teamwork from defenses and mechanical smarts from offenders. It will introduce a map more interesting than any other in rotation.

It's fun in pubs when people don't know what's going on, but in organized play it is super boring.   But a regrab train on this map could be a lot more tenuous.   It's really not. It's very easy to keep regrab because there are so many boosts out of base that put you past the chasers. Even if one defender spawns at a lucky time, keeping the flag in base 1v1 is very hard due to the bombs/boosts directly onto the flag.   The bombs are equally useful for defense and offenses and interesting combinations could result in caps.   Useful in pubs, but in competitive not nearly as much. You really need to take people by surprise to use them, and communication kind of ruins that.   The map rewards skilled boosting more than any other map.   The boosts are super easy for majors players. And each boost gives enough options that even two chasers can't ever take them all away. This is why the map is so chasey.   It will introduce a map more interesting than any other in rotation.   It's different, but honestly not interesting to play or watch."

The only annoying thing about it is the little gap that people can hide in. People are way too scared of chasey maps these days, and it's making for some seriously boring map rotations.  Although I would love to play danger zone and blast-off and TWP over some ugly thing like Constriction, I would much prefer to see a map that hasn't made MLTP before. My vote goes to GamePad, or maybe EMERALD."

MLTP,3duoxc,marmaris74,5,Sun Jul 19 19:24:33 2015 UTC,"It rewards teams that practice good communication and discipline when the flags get out of base.  In fact, most everything I like about TWP boils down to it rewarding teamwork, coordination, and communication.  Want to get the flag out of base?  Then you either need to keep the outside defender off the portal exit, or you need to force the inside defender far enough away from the flag that your partner can grab and force the outside defender to start containing instead of camping the portal exit, which can set up regrab.  Want to keep the flag in base?  You've got to know when your partner is off the portal exit so you don't let the other team grab.  If you want to score, you have to be able to block well on your own or consistently bait the other team into flacciding before your FC gets there.  Then there's powerups.  If you want to get all the powerups, your defense is going to have to extend outside the base.  This means the other team can grab, but TWP is designed such that you're not punished by going for powerups; you're still ahead of the flag carrier when they grab, no matter which powerup you're going for.  A lot of maps these days punish defenders for going for powerups, which places powerups under the offense's responsibility.  This results in situations where, if your offense has to play some offensive d and neglect powerups for one round, you have to play catch-up with powerup timers/collection for at least another round, if not two or three or all of them, because you couldn't risk your offense going for them.  TWP allows defenders to go for pups even in situations where they have to get to the other team's base, because those powerups aren't out of the way."

MLTP,3duoxc,SuperSans,-3,Mon Jul 20 04:04:16 2015 UTC,"Constriction is the way to go.  It is a fast map, that features competitive pup battles and an insane number of boost/bomb possibilities.  I also think the square tile near the flag gives this map a unique feature that can make or break the O/D, and act as a shield for an FC trying to escape base.  Defense can be played conservatively or recklessly, as the numerous bombs/boost allow chasers to quickly catch a fleeing FC.  Numerous corners punish sloppy ball control and make this map a technical challenge.  It is an all around explosive map for offenses and risk takers will produce very quick caps if using the proper sequence of boosts.  If played, I could see Constriction being one of the most exciting maps to watch in the whole rotation."
MLTP,3duoxc,HelloBrothers,9,Sun Jul 19 19:18:40 2015 UTC,"Please no. Constriction plays the same way it does in competitive as it does in pubs. Random wall boost mechanics, lots of flaccids, and lots of hitting that dumbass corner going into base."

Not only that, but you have better control over wall-bounce boosts. With the wall boosts, your path is the same a majority of the time."

MLTP is shooting to have these rules implemented starting next week.  We will keep you thoroughly updated.    Article VII - Cheating  Section I - Cheating   (a) Cheating is strictly prohibited.   (b) Cheating includes: using scripts that are not on the ""whitelist"", smurfing, starting the half on the wrong team and disturbing with the other team, changing game settings from the default (except for settings expressed in these rules i.e. match length, capture limit, etc), banning anyone in the match (from your team included), moderators intentionally banning league players with unjust bans, intentionally lowering draft stock, and non-playing teammates communicating with playing teammates.  The commissioners have the right to punish players for other forms of cheating not covered by this section. (c) The use of scripts not on the ""whitelist"" in public servers is prohbited. The only place that non-approved scripts can be used is in ""Test"" servers.     Section IV - Scripts   (a) The ""Whitelist"" of approved scripts can be found here. Any script not on this list is prohibited from use in any location outside of ""Test"" servers. (b) In order to get a script included on the ""Whitelist"", players should submit the script in question here for review. (c) A committee comprising of representatives from MLTP, NLTP, ELTP, OLTP, and USC will be in charge of adding scripts to the ""Whitelist."""

MLTP,3dd6d2,Omidio,7,Wed Jul 15 21:01:36 2015 UTC,Figure 8 was like a top 5 result last season though. I don't think it was voted highly because of it's tendency to produce exciting and strategic games
MLTP,3dd6d2,jjpoole7,7,Wed Jul 15 15:12:08 2015 UTC,"The captains have the right to veto whatever map is chosen, so if the winning map was obviously a joke choice, we can veto it."

MLTP,3dd6d2,manbare,2,Wed Jul 15 15:57:35 2015 UTC,tbh MLTP matches on Figure 8 would be a lot of fun to watch. It'd be something completely different from everything else that's been played in the past 3 or 4 seasons.

There're no tricks on Figure 8. It's just 1 boost, 2 powerups, and a small base. Juking in small spaces, blocking like crazy, and timing will be literally everything here. It's like basketball before the 3-point shot and shot clock, which isn't necessarily a flattering analogy but I think it'd be fun.   I prolly wouldn't vote for it tho, I want Gamepad."

MLTP,3dd6d2,manbare,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:26:18 2015 UTC,But on those maps there are other aspects to it. There're gates and fancier boosts and what not. Figure 8 has none of those other things. That's what I kinda like about it.
MLTP,3dd6d2,BuckeyeLeaves,2,Wed Jul 15 22:20:02 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but Figure 8 takes your points to extremes. One of the only two exit-ways leads to single-tiled tunnels. Grabbing the flag in MLTP today would be difficult enough on this map, and getting out or even staying alive/capping would be nearly impossible with the amount of talent now, especially because of the such tight space."

I think by having it on /r/MLTP will help keep the votes mostly isolated to MLTP players. MLTP teams will publicize the vote within their teams, while other leagues will not.

He's good     Or is MLTP meant to be a spectator sport, that furthers the growth of Tagpro? When i first discovered Tagpro, i watched an MLTP game on Bombing Run, and it was one of the coolest games i've ever seen. Is Bombing Run an acceptable map anymore? Fuck no.

That season the Protagonists had 5 players sitting in the game for about 30 seconds and led my team, KGBallers, to confusedly half-play thinking the other team would call a timeout (back when hot-subs weren't used). That led to a 3 cap train and one of the only losses we suffered that season.   There was a huge blowup in modmail after the game because me and Dino were furious the caps counted when there was both 5 players on the other team AND no communication coming from the other team. That argument led to the rule being put into effect.   This is almost the exact situation we had that season, so I'm glad somebody else got to use our misfortune to make things right.

MLTP,3db9y1,jazzcigarettes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm sure it's not a big deal at all, I just really like the captains to know that I won't share their private screenshots in public - that way they can have more faith in saying what they truly believe."
MLTP,3db9y1,xm8compact,3,Wed Jul 15 19:04:42 2015 UTC,Lol I believe it. It was a whole new side of you. Also we hadn't lost to that point iirc so that adds to it.
MLTP,3db9y1,newtruckfund,6,Wed Jul 15 03:11:36 2015 UTC,I've been swept in reg season twice since s4.   Both times to raven.  But this was no sweep. This was a veritable dustbusting.
MLTP,3db9y1,jjpoole7,2,Wed Jul 15 03:23:10 2015 UTC,Both times to raven.    Heh   We lost one of the other games anyway but yeah the swing from those 30 sec or whatever was huge.

MLTP,3db9y1,TPStalin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"AND no communication coming from the other team.   That argument led to the rule being put into effect. This is almost the exact situation we had that season   This is not that exact situation. As soon as Googy joined back into the game and realized he couldn't get the group page to load to drag himself out, I went directly to Neb's channel and told him that that was the case. Neb said he was fine with it, as he knew it wasn't intentional."
MLTP,3db9y1,jjpoole7,11,Tue Jul 14 23:12:56 2015 UTC,"That doesn't matter though. Neb isn't in the game, he's not the one negatively affected by the presence of five people in the game. The fact that one of the players in the game brought it up to the commissioners means that it WAS something that caused them confusion and impacted their play"
MLTP,3db9y1,jjpoole7,5,Tue Jul 14 23:20:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that it doesn't matter in regards to the reading of the rule. However, you say that ""this is almost the exact situation"" and it is not. Neb was told of our situation, and I told Neb to relay the message to his team. This was all during the 20 seconds that Googy remained in the game."
MLTP,3db9y1,-Albus-,8,Tue Jul 14 23:23:30 2015 UTC,Yes it is. The players in the game had their play impacted. How is Neb going to relay the message to his team while they are in game? How is that going to happen in a manner where their play isn't negatively affected?  The entire point of the rule is to at best cancel out an advantage the other team might have and at worst penalize the team for creating an environment where the other team is disadvantaged.  Don't tell me you would be against an application of the rule if it didn't negatively impact your team. If your team was negatively impacted you'd have every right to apply the rule and would be justified in doing so.
MLTP,3db9y1,TPStalin,5,Tue Jul 14 23:26:29 2015 UTC,"Don't tell me you would be against an application of the rule if it didn't negatively impact your team. If your team was negatively impacted you'd have every right to apply the rule and would be justified in doing so.   I agree 100%. If the other team had 5 people in the game for 20 seconds and it impacted our team, I would have sent in a formal complaint.   However, as I've said multiple times now, Neb and I agreed that this incident was not intentional  and that Googy could do nothing to get himself out, and we would basically ignore it. We decided that at the time of the play. Captains are allowed to agree to rule tweaks. However, after Adrenaline Boosts tied, someone else (not named Neb) sent in a formal complaint despite the fact that Neb and I had already taken care of the situation.   It's not as cut and dry of a situation as the rule itself."
MLTP,3db9y1,marmaris74,7,Tue Jul 14 23:35:37 2015 UTC,"and we would basically ignore it.   Basically, or formally? This is an important distinction.  Neb is fully within his rights to agree that it was not intentional, while also agreeing that it impacted his team.  If Neb wanted to formally ignore what happened, he could easily do this and there would be no penalty.  But he hasn't done that..."
MLTP,3db9y1,Dinosawyerr,5,Tue Jul 14 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"As I said before, Neb and I agreed at the time that we would ignore the situation because it wasn't intentional and Googy was trying to leave, but he couldn't get back into the group. It wasn't formal because we didn't write it down or anything, but we had a gentlemen's agreement that we would let it slide. I didn't hear about it for more than 2 weeks, and I thought that was that.   Then, someone on Neb's team sent in this complaint. And after that happened, Neb doesn't want to remove his team's complaint because he doesn't want to give the impression that he isn't in support with his team's desire to get their first win."
MLTP,3db9y1,Dinosawyerr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:48:06 2015 UTC,Neb doesn't want to remove his team's complaint because he doesn't want to give the impression that he isn't in support with his team's desire to get their first win.   Ouch.
MLTP,3db9y1,Dinosawyerr,3,Wed Jul 15 07:27:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like we aren't ever going to agree. I get your point on Neb saying it's fine, but I personally don't think what Neb says supersedes how his team feels. See my censure. Mikero didn't think any of it was necessary, but his team complained to the MLTP commissioners and that led to the ruling."
MLTP,3db9y1,nolanizer,0,Tue Jul 14 23:48:09 2015 UTC,"That's actually a little different than what happened.  I think the rule existed for the start of Season 5, and the capture penalty was assessed accordingly.  Your team tried to argue that the entire game should be invalidated."
MLTP,3db9y1,TPStalin,8,Tue Jul 14 23:11:58 2015 UTC,I think the rule existed for the start of Season 5   I don't think it did but I'm not even close to sure.
MLTP,3db9y1,TPStalin,6,Tue Jul 14 23:15:09 2015 UTC,"LOL PLS  I don't want to have a 200 comment argument, but the timeline went as follows.   incident happens  we go into channel after half asking what happened and if we were going to do anything about it  ""i dunno we'll talk about it after the game""  continue with game, end up losing by 2 after overextending trying to get tying last minute cap  ""We'll give you guys one cap aww shucks you still lost by one"""
MLTP,3db9y1,usedgoat,0,Tue Jul 14 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"You missed the stuff before the incident.  I believe I had made a ruling to the captains that teams do not need to notify the other team if they have an inactive player.  According to the rules I had clarified before this match happened, our team broke no rules.  We gave a cap afterwards even though the rules did not support a capture penalty.  I'm trying to look it back up but there is so much stuff that it's hard to find."
MLTP,3db9y1,ohnowait,3,Tue Jul 14 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"The jist of the argument was that there was an ongoing discussion concerning that type of situation where a rule was proposed for discussion but had dissenting opinions so people were trying to determine whether it was valid to use to make a ruling or not. It was as borderline as it gets and was the reason why there was such an argument, which I'm not disputing.  Just don't try and act like the ""compensation"" was anything less than a spit-in-your-face joke."
MLTP,3db9y1,Dinosawyerr,-2,Tue Jul 14 23:27:46 2015 UTC,"The three two person independent commissioner group of JGibbs/Swingman/Ginseng unanimously agreed to a 1 capture penalty.    I'm not sure how you can argue it being a ""spit-in-your-face"" joke if that's what they found after hearing all the testimony."
MLTP,3db9y1,ohnowait,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:30:19 2015 UTC,haha please.  What a crack team that committee was. They reluctantly gave me a ruling after ignoring me for 2 weeks. This one was your decision.
MLTP,3db9y1,Dinosawyerr,0,Tue Jul 14 23:37:57 2015 UTC,That's an entirely untrue accusation. JGibbs/Swingman debated this issue and came to this conclusion.
MLTP,3db9y1,dccarlove,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:38:59 2015 UTC,JGibbs/Swingman/G1nseng only became commissioners in Season 6. You were the sole commissioner in Season 5.
MLTP,3db9y1,SamSims-,0,Wed Jul 15 03:42:22 2015 UTC,JGibbs/Swingman were massively helping out season 5 in commissioner capacities and were chosen to independently review this case.
MLTP,3db9y1,TagProTyrus,5,Wed Jul 15 03:45:10 2015 UTC,"That is false. Substitution rules for season 5:   (a) Teams are allowed to put a 5th player in the ""Waiting"" slot during matches who can substitute in if needed.  (b) Substitutions will happen live, meaning we will not exit and go back to group.  (c) Only one substitution break for each team is allowed per half.  (d) Teams substituting need to give the opponents at least a 10 second notification that a substitute is about to come on.  (e) The substitute cannot be in the ""Spectator"" slot, but they can be listening in on Mumble.   One of the arguments in modmail was to award reconciliation caps, but I was arguing for a replay. The cap reconciliation rule was added after the fact. Season 6 this rule was added:   (b) For every 20 seconds that there are five players (four active, one inactive) in the match, the team with five will be penalized one capture. This time accumulates, but is reset after each half."
MLTP,3db9y1,SamSims-,6,Tue Jul 14 23:16:28 2015 UTC,"Yes you're right.    The reconciliation cap rule got applied to this case though, so 1 cap was taken away but it didn't impact the result of the match."
MLTP,3db9y1,TagProTyrus,7,Tue Jul 14 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, my and dino's argument was that the presence of of the fifth caused us to think we would be going back to group and thus didn't get power-ups etc, then let in a cap chain due to that fact.  Regardless, I'm glad the rule is what it is"
MLTP,3db9y1,SamSims-,3,Tue Jul 14 23:22:54 2015 UTC,Does this mean my +/- goes down by one?

MLTP,3db9y1,donuts42,10,Wed Jul 15 04:51:43 2015 UTC,The only thing I don't get about the rule is why not have it as every 21 seconds allowing for players who are afk to be kicked. That seems fairer?
MLTP,3db9y1,LoweJ,2,Tue Jul 14 23:12:07 2015 UTC,It might have to do with afk balls still being able to affect play however slightly; I do agree though.
MLTP,3db9y1,donuts42,6,Tue Jul 14 23:14:45 2015 UTC,With that logic the 20 second rule is floored anyway. We're talking about a seconds difference.

MLTP,3db9y1,marmaris74,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:38:25 2015 UTC,"Imagine your team is up by 1 with 30 seconds left in the game and the momentum is not on your side. You could easily just bring in a 5th ball, keep him inactive, to give your base a little more defense for the final play of the game and be guaranteed to not lose a cap due to penalty."
MLTP,3db9y1,thewthew,14,Tue Jul 14 23:15:32 2015 UTC,"You can still technically do that if you just have the guy leave after 19 seconds. I think changing the rule would be fair.  And the reason, fwiw, is that this rule was instituted back when the afk timer was larger and the fact that they're both 20 seconds is incidental."
MLTP,3db9y1,anderwabell,5,Tue Jul 14 23:18:34 2015 UTC,"First of all enforcing all rules involves an element of trust. Also you have the don't be a dick rule to cover stuff like that surely? And couldn't you do that at the moment and just leave after 19 seconds.  I just think if you've genuinely lagged out or you accidentally join again because of a lag out and don't press a key for 20 seconds causing you to be kicked for afk, you shouldn't be punished for it."
MLTP,3db9y1,i_practice_santeria,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:20:49 2015 UTC,"There's 2 different versions of the rule. One is every 5 seconds a team has 5 active players, they are penalized a cap. This one is every 20 seconds with 5 players (4 active, 1 inactive), they are penalized a cap. It's up to the team to not sub people in while the 4th is still lagged out."
MLTP,3db9y1,marmaris74,3,Tue Jul 14 23:31:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the problem with this one.  Zvonvok subbed in while Googy was actually out (read: not in the game).  But somehow on his group page he ended up joining the game after Zvon entered and pretty much simultaneously left the group, rendering him unable to exit the game.  If you look at the footage, it's pretty clear what happened."
MLTP,3db9y1,i_practice_santeria,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:41:41 2015 UTC,"I think that it makes even more sense then to increase the inactive one by a second if there's another rule to cover active players.   Googy didn't mean to join again if I remember correctly, he was stuck on the group page or something."
MLTP,3db9y1,ratherintents,5,Tue Jul 14 23:35:38 2015 UTC,Honest question: under the current rules could you feasibly do that with 0:19 left and get away with it?

MLTP,3db9y1,ratherintents,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:25:55 2015 UTC,"Yes. The only rule I know that could possibly stop someone from doing this is the ""DBAD"" rule."

MLTP,3db9y1,thewthew,5,Tue Jul 14 23:30:29 2015 UTC,Is it this one?   The commissioners have the right to punish players for other forms of cheating not covered by this section.

It's too late to change what happened here, and this is going by the rules that have been set up, but in the future if a team's being penalized due to a bug in the game and it can be traced to that bug, could an exception be set up?"
MLTP,3db9y1,ccga4,12,Tue Jul 14 23:12:18 2015 UTC,"somebody should've banned him   For the record: DO NOT DO THIS. It is explicitly against the rules because it's not fair that some teams have moderators on them and others don't. IDK what the punishment would be for it but seriously, DO NOT DO THIS. Just have one of the not lagging out guys leave for a little bit and try to play 3v4 until the lagging guy gets kicked normally."

MLTP,3db9y1,marmaris74,7,Tue Jul 14 23:23:45 2015 UTC,Banning a player from the group does absolutely nothing to resolve any problems.  Using mod powers to ban a player from TagPro (obviously with intent to unban him after) is expressly forbidden.

And spawn killed the fc when he was ahead of 3. The worst part was that our last-seconds tying cap became a last-second meaningless cap. Fun times!"

MLTP,3db9y1,ndprice,-2,Tue Jul 14 23:01:54 2015 UTC,"I say the following trying as best as I can to remain impartial despite the fact that this involves my minors team.  If you know me, you know I have strong opinions about things being fair and people being reasonable.  I do not find this decision to be either.     Personally, I don't think Googy affected the game play at all.  Their FC brought in a rolling bomb, cruised right past him, and got out of base no problem.  Googy's ball sat in the middle of nowhere, doing nothing for 20 seconds exactly.    To boot, Googy joined the team and immediately left the group.  This suggests Googy had no ability to leave the game.  And his own teammates wouldn't have even seen his ball for 5-10 seconds after he spawned, as they were out chasing.  So in a scenario in which none of Boostin Dynamo's players really knew or had a reasonable way to react to Googy's ball being there, the team gets penalized and ends up having a loss instead of a tie.    Now again, I'm trying my best to be impartial.  For what it's worth, I don't see this as having a significant effect on our team's playoff chances, morale, or anything else.  I just see it as being absolutely unnecessary given the situation, particularly since Neb saw fit to let it slide the night of the game.  Now, a week later, we have a complaint and a ruling.    To the captains who did not pass the veto: you followed the letter of the rule, but not the spirit of the game.  That, in my opinion, should never have to happen."
MLTP,3db9y1,TPStalin,9,Tue Jul 14 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"a week later   I know you weren't trying to imply anything by this, but the reason these rulings take so long to come out is that we really, really talk about these for a while. Like we don't want to rush these rulings out, and reddit communication isn't that fast.  And I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say this, but the veto vote wasn't looking very close when we stopped it. I can't say this for sure, but even if the veto vote had needed only a majority to pass (not a supermajority like it actually needs), it almost certainly wouldn't have. I think the commissioners were a lot more conflicted on this than the captains were."
MLTP,3db9y1,marmaris74,2,Tue Jul 14 23:10:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the commissioners being split is a healthy sign.  I recognize not everything is clear.  I think the captains are happy enough to say ""oh yeah, that's the rule"" without really thinking about the justness of the rule and the fairness of the situation.  Letter of law, not the spirit of the game."
MLTP,3db9y1,bobby_gordon1,15,Tue Jul 14 23:15:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure those by-the-book Nazi captains never even considered that this was something completely unintentional and completely out of Googy's control.  I'm sure they disregarded the context of the infraction and instead wanted to get their rocks off on punishing a team for an honest mistake.  I'm sure they voted the way they did not because they wanted to preserve the integrity of the rule to safeguard against its potential abuse in the future (""But Googy did it and didn't get punished!""), but rather to victimize a random player whose ISP fucked him over.  Yeah, I'm sure that's what happened."
MLTP,3db9y1,NeonAura,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:48:48 2015 UTC,Amen.
MLTP,3db9y1,jtiza,-2,Wed Jul 15 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is I think the captains are afraid to make judgment calls.  ""Preserve the integrity of the rule to safeguard against its potential abuse in the future"" indicates that in my view.  The rule being in place is fine, and it being the default is fine.  Vetoing in this situation would in no way give an obligation to captains to veto in a case that is abuse.    Nobody is getting their rocks off doing this.  They're afraid to make a judgment call.  I think the need to have rock-solid, inescapable rules is indicative of a league where too many people have tried to game the system, and captains are, as you perfectly illustrate, weary to allow even an inch because there are assholes out there."
MLTP,3db9y1,NeonAura,4,Tue Jul 14 23:54:14 2015 UTC,"They're afraid to make a judgment call.   And what qualifies you to make this statement?  Did you see the modmail discussions?  Something tells me you didn't.  Multiple captains voiced their opinions about this being a crappy situation either way.  We weren't afraid to make a judgment call; we made one.  We just didn't make it the way you feel it should be made, apparently."
MLTP,3db9y1,marmaris74,-1,Wed Jul 15 00:00:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, Turbo, I did see the modmail discussions.  I am a vice captain.  My sense was that most captains recognized it was a ""shitty situation,"" probably thought that it was an extremely minor issue, but voted against the veto to, in your words, ""preserve the integrity of the rule.""    We don't know how the captains voted, nor do we have their rationale, but the fact that it overwhelmingly failed to pass veto, despite being a split decision for the commissioners, suggests the captains have a different attitude."
MLTP,3db9y1,jjpoole7,4,Wed Jul 15 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"probably thought that it was an extremely minor issue   This right here (and other comments you've made) is why I'm still skeptical that you actually read the modmail discussion.  People didn't just wave this off without a thought, which is what you seem to be implying here.  It is a big issue, and that's precisely why the captains voted to stick to the rules.  Suggesting that we're ""afraid"" to make a decision that favors the spirit of the game is simply disingenuous.  The captains (myself included) specifically mentioned that this wasn't a clear-cut case of someone breaking the rules.  The way you've been insisting that we don't have the moral fortitude to see beyond the rules is annoying, since it's quite clearly stemming from you simply disagreeing with the decision the captains came to and looking for an angle to attack the decision, regardless of whether your description of the events is accurate.  You can disagree with the decision all you want, but at least give us the courtesy of not intentionally misrepresenting what the captains did."

While I was procrastinating, however, I decided to take a crack at calculating the West' SOS using this formula.   tl;dr is that I took the total win % of team's opposition (win % was calculated by having the total points those teams achieved divided by 150, the max total possible points up to week 5), multiplied it by 2, added the win % each team's opposition's opposition (a total of 750 possible points), and then divided it by 3.

MLTP,3d6wrt,Rhapsody_in_White,2,Tue Jul 14 00:26:36 2015 UTC,"if you refresh now, it takes you 10 seconds to respawn, worse then the 6 it takes to switch teams and back.  I think the main thing is that every team has the same option for getting better spawns at the start of a match. We don't have some people doing 1 thing and other people doing another. Consistency is the most fair option.  The best option, and this has been mentioned in threads before is to have an americas cup style game start. Everyone can move freely in the 10x10 starting box as the counter goes to 0. Leaving the box acts as a wall until the counter hits 0."

Check did well to carry the flag, was pretty slippery.    Somewhat disappointed that we got swept for the first time this season, I wanted to use this game as a measuring stick to see where we were at, and was hopeful we'd pull off a split.

So far Marble Madness has played teams with a combined record of 12-24-4 (W/L/T).  Skillz that Killz, on the other hand, have played teams with a combined record of 18-18-4 (W/L/T).

Anyone aware of a player using a script who doesn't immediately inform a commissioner will banned for the same number of weeks for which they were aware of the script use. Players who have demonstrated a sufficient knowledge of script-writing will be required to record and publish their league matches in order to demonstrate their vanilla-only browser.  Any players who openly complain about the policy will receive a warning for the first offense and a multi-week ban for additional offenses.

Regarding copyright flagging: It probably does flag the twitch replay many times. I also record my broadcasts locally and upload to youtube. Youtube is generally more flexible here. If they catch copyrighted content in the broadcast they will sometimes monetize the video with ads and give the money to the copyright content owner (seems fair). Otherwise they will automatically remove the songs from the audio by processing it out.  If I ever hit a situation where Youtube blocks a video due to this, I can remove the offending content and upload the rest of the game. For this reason I make sure all in game music is non copyrighted, and try to keep the team exposes limited to the pregame show."
