I would never consider seeking sexual relations with men simply because of ""loneliness"". I would get a dog. Also I have lots of friends. Really the only thing stopping me from establishing a relationship is financial inadequacy, which I'm working on. I cannot relate to your perspective at all. I do wish you manage your loneliness.    Sounds like you don't want love making which incorporates more emotion and just physical sexual release which from gay men comes easier? There seems to be a conflict in that you seek companionship yet just a physical bang bang."

Internet diagnoses are super sketchy. What you actually need to do is see a psychologist or therapist.   I'm inclined to say, though, that until this starts interfering with your daily life (i.e. you make decisions you would not ordinarily make, or you avoid things that are routine) you're probably in the clear. It's okay to have a fertile imagination, until it starts to overtake your waking world. Everyone's got their hobbies, after all."

If your only concern is that having this fantasy might mean you are mentally ill, you probably don't need to worry about it.

Unfortunately, I'm only a brilliant debater in my own head."
confessions,3e2d4s,GetPet,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:00 2015 UTC,I think this might be normal for some of us. I've been doing it since I was little too. The difference being if I were watching a movie or show I would make up a character and add them into it to represent me. Or I would make up crazy situations in my head about somewhere I work being taken over and it was up to me to save everyone. I wasn't given really any attention as a child so I think that's where it came from. I also use music to help me think up the situations like you do. I might be singing them or just kinda have background music to help set the mood for whatever situation I'm making up. I don't think we are abnormal lol. If anything we are just really imaginative and have been using it as a coping mechanism for loneliness all of these years.

You have an active imagination.  So does my husband.  He makes up stories in his head to pass the time while he's driving, for example... and he can wind his way through a story (starring ""him"" of course) over the course of days or weeks.    We're both avid readers, and will usually read during our meals.  Every so often I'll look up and he's sitting there eating and sort of staring off into space.  He'll notice me looking and say, ""I've got a story going...""  His stories are sometimes alternate timelines... ""if I'd made THIS choice instead of the choice I actually made, what would have happened...?""  He'll imagine confrontations he's never had/would never have.  He's been a superhero, a villain, and everything in between.  He's been god, the devil and a prophet.  He's been to the moon and colonized a planet thousands of light years away.  He's also lived on the bottom of the ocean and drilled to the center of the earth.  I've said many times that I wish he'd figure out a way to write down his stories - we'd be rich! LOL  I do it all too, just to a lesser extent, by the way.  Mine is pretty much limited to when I'm in the shower or laying down to sleep at night.  We're both in our mid-40s, and have been doing this since we were children.    So... no, I don't think you have something wrong with you.

They're out there.  Break off this engagement and find her. And your fiance deserves better than YOU as well -- no offense. Nothing against YOU, but she deserves someone who loves her AND is sexually attracted to her. Don't marry her! You're already resenting her for not working a steady job and for not paying any rent. You're also losing patience with her lack of desire or motivation to lose weight. Do you think this will get better after you marry her? Do you think these resentments will just go away? They won't; they'll fester, and your resentment towards her will only get worse. So you like her family and she likes yours -- big deal. Be friends with her, then. That's basically what you're doing already anyway. You're living with her, enjoying her company and conversation, but not having sex. That sounds like a great roommate to me, not a fiance. Save yourself -- and HER -- a LOT of future heartache and headaches and break up with her! Do you think you're hiding your feelings? It sounds like she's already on to you. WHY are you staying? And what's this BS about 'what' or 'who' you love? Okay, you love her, but it sounds like you love her as a friend, NOT a wife. Sex is very important in a relationship; don't ignore this!

It's not something I was worried about. If you are tied up on her not paying rent, you need to take a step back and figure out if you are looking for a life partner or a roommate. If you are not prepared to live with this person AS THEY ARE, then you are not ready. Not in the slightest. I will be blunt: what if she gets fatter? Unless you are the calorie police, it can happen to anyone. And do you really have the energy to plan all the meals and enforce them?

confessions,3e0zr5,GoodAndBluts,2,Tue Jul 21 06:58:16 2015 UTC,"You need to feel some sort of attraction to her before you're married. There needs to be recurring chemistry. By that I mean after the butterflies where off, you still need to be able to look at her and feel magnetism(best way I can describe it). All of the problems you have described will get worse unless she makes a very dedicated effort to change them. Women often gain weight after marriage, especially if their overweight. If this is repulsing to you, don't try and kid yourself. Her other issues will just become magnified and you will hate yourself for the horrible feelings you are having towards her. On the other hand, a person should not have to change who they are for someone else, and by entering a marriage with someone you don't love as a wife, you are counting on her changing for you or you will have to change to accommodate her. The break up will be hard, but it has to be done, ASAP."

The fact that you have been honest about your concerns and she has not made the necessary changes to get healthy or to contribute financially to the household are major red flags.  Things will only get worse, not better.  Thankfully you have only been together for three years instead of a decade (or more) and it won't come as a surprise when you call things off or eventually get a divorce if you don't nip this in the bud soon.

Unless the weight and the job situation are drastic new changes (and if so, she should go see a doctor to rule out a mental or physical problem), she was already like that when you first got together so there's no reason to think she will change. And being with someone who is already starting to resent her is probably just going to make it worse rather than better, and obviously it will get worse for you too. You'd rather go without sex than have sex with her, so why wouldn't you rather go without a relationship for a little while until you can find someone you're more compatible with? Don't make the mistake of legally tying yourself to someone you're already unhappy with, because getting married will not make either of you happier."

I was going to say that if you both agree that the love and bond is satisfying enough to overrule the lack of sexual connection then that'd be great.  But, as I read and reread I see you do feel resentful.  You also brought up some non-sexual issues you have with her.  No one is going to be perfect, but it sounds like you aren't expecting that.  Only you can define what makes or breaks the deal.  As humans we are sexual creatures.  It's a basic physiological and psychological need and drive.  Things might be status quo now, but you can imagine that it would be likely not to run into a major problem if you commit to this for life?  If it's an egg shell situation now, before marriage, then how will it be after marriage?  My advice to you is to seriously think about the big picture of both your futures.  It sounds like you already are.  The question is if you feel sufficiently safe/ok/strong enough to take action on things.  The best ending is the one where you both minimize the pain and pursue your happiness."

Although at your age you haven't experience a lot of ""life"" yet, I'm guessing you are miles ahead of her.

The girl you just met is 20 and doing the bar scene (OMG, UNDERAGE DRINKING!) and seems to be much closer to your level.  Though you don't sound unhappy with your current girlfriend, that difference in mentality will most likely eventually tear you two apart.

confessions,3dtlkh,bigbadbarrongrr,4,Sun Jul 19 12:22:01 2015 UTC,"Your parents aren't always your closest bonds.   Sometimes, you're just so different that you always remain more strangers than close loved ones. It's okay. I knew a guy, when his father passed away, he only cried for a bit, but in a week his life was more or less back to normal. He told me ""there's no wrong or right way to deal with death; the only thing that's inappropriate is to not accept it. But if you accept it, you'll grieve and heal. Everyone grieves differently. My father and I were distant, be was from a different time, a different culture, all around, just too different from me.""  He then told me that when his father died, he cried more for the unfairness of life than for his father.  See, his father endured much hardship, like yours, and never seemed to win, despite working himself to death. And at the end, he died after being married to his third wife of 2 years (whom he didn't love) while his kidneys failed and he had a second stroke (suffered one earlier that year). So, he asked himself, what was it all worth?  He began reading a lot in order to define his own code, what he believed, and to make his life worth living, something his father was never committed to.  Also, his father cheated on his mom and was all-around self-destructive, to give you more perspective.   Make your life better than your dad's life was; at the depth of his core, he couldn't carry the weight life gave him--but you can be better. Some part of him would want that for you, because, and this is my belief, every parent that loves their child, even if they're not the perfecy parent wants their child to go further, be better, do better than they did.  You want to honor his memory? Live the best life you can.  You want revenge for whatever reason? Live the best life you can.

confessions,3dtlkh,chaveznieves,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"My dad isn't dead yet (That I know of. Haven't talked to him in a while), but I have a feeling that when he goes, it'll be like that for me.  And I'm ok with that. Here's why.  I already lost him, a long time ago. I won't bore you with the details, but the short of it is that it has been many decades since my biological dad played the emotional role of 'dad' in my life. He stopped doing that a long time ago.  When somebody's dad dies and it rips them to shreds, it's because that man filled an ongoing role in the person's life. There was an emotional relationship there. It was important and meaningful to the person, and now it's gone. So they grieve.  For people like you and me, we lost that relationship a long time ago. The man didn't die then, but in terms of the emotional structure of our lives, he may as well have. Whatever grieving we were going to do for having lost our father, has largely already happened.  Sure, his actual death is still going to hit you with a certain finality. It may bring up whatever traces of emotion you still have left to process. But compared to somebody whose dad was their best buddy and who is just starting down that road? You're practically at the end of it already.  It's no surprise you're not wracked with grief. You already paid that price long ago. You don't have a thing to feel bad about."

It took me really long time before hypnosis did anything to me so I got addicted to hypnosis, but then I kind of discovered that I do it myself and don't really need hypnosis so I would just meditate myself, use my imagination - imagining that I'm having sex and all the feelings that come with it. Then I added porn into that and then it became as easy as looking at some porn and it would just happen almost by itself.   I had some problems with it though, things started happening. Orgasms would happen randomely during a day and it would be really hard to stop them, then I had terrible pain/uncomfortable feeling in the balls, that pretty much got me to stop this. It also stopped feeling good, it was just way too intense.   So recently I got interested at it again and wanted to relearn this skill and it turned out to be harder to learn it 2nd time than I thought it would be, but after I learned it again I didn't feel uncomfortable anymore. It's intense, but it keeps feeling good - just feels better and better.   So far I did it for a week and don't feel any bad side effects that I had last time."

As for the vividity of your imagination, I can't say really comment on it because I only have my own imagination to draw upon and who knows, maybe I just lack imagination or you are just a more imaginative person than most.      I would, however, suggest reading up on ethical philosophy and being more aware of your actions.  edit: there was more I was going to talk about involving movies/literalture 50/50 and etc.; about how it could decrease your chances of doing something bad or whatever but I have no valid sources to back up my claims and it's a lot of work to do so.0 All I have are weak conjectures that I have come up with on my own without any real readings or research on the subject."

It is pure biological need when it comes to fucking eating and sleeping. Killing could also be apart of our genetic makeup. What if you were to get the same satisfaction of hunting down deer rather than humans? Hunting or shooting guns at a shooting range could let you work out some of your aggression.

Don't you ever feel like you jump through society's stupid-ass hoops so that you can jump through more hoops? And, if you're right about killing being part of genetic makeup, then holy shit you guys are good at cathexis (& catharsis).  I'm not being crass or sarcastic--that amazes me that other people produce the same amount of Thanatos (you know--the aggression drive?) as I and be able to handle to ""well"".  You have no idea how fucking jealous I am of those who can get their kicks from violent video games and sports and shooting dumb animals that can't fight back.  I'm jealous of the people who can watch an action movie and be cool, and not have to follow their friends into a parking lot at night with a pocket knife, contemplating what it would be like to shank them.  Like I've said, I feel so very unheard and…  Castrated, if you will, by trying to work these feelings out through my imagination and creativity.  One of the major reasons I even made this post was because I'm at the end of my rope and I need someone to hold me accountable.  Is there an underground ring of gentlemen serial killers I can join (as stupid as that sounds)?  Is there an agency out there that needs torturers?

Fight for the nation in which you were born in. You don't have to kill but if you do have to, at least you were ordered to. Don't kill people that don't deserve to die. Kill people that need to be killed because they will blow up 500 innocent civilians. Perhaps there is no right or wrong. Perhaps each individual society on earth brainwashes every citizen with fear, loathing and hate. But you have to fight your desires to shank some innocent. It isn't right because not what society says but what our hearts say. I don't approve of what orange county California has made me try to think about the world OK? However I do believe that I have been raised with an open mind and an open heart  I sir, have seen death, destruction, self destructive behaviors, physical abuse, mental abuse, drug abuse, suicidal attempts, guns that have offed my family members either by their own finger or by another's.  I am Italian. I am Irish, Scottish, and German. I know what a real war is. A real fight for survival is. Do not even discredit yourself and your ancestors.

Maybe, if I wasn't so obsessed with ending other people's lives, I'd be thinking about ending my own; 'cause I sure as hell don't deserve a second chance.  And, my friend, not for the sake of argument but just to level with you and share my beliefs, I think the knowledge of right and wrong--if it's anywhere to be found--is in Man's heart, from birth.  It doesn't come from society or anywhere else.  Although, I think man is also born evil, and no amount of knowing what good and bad is can stop that.  With that being said, I don't know what to do.  Yes, I'd love to give back and serve my country, maybe even learn to live for something bigger than myself.  But, practically, I can't.  I have physical limitations, and my mind is full of nothing anyone needs.  I can't help but feel like my situation is leading to some big punchline that I won't be around for.

Obviously, there are people that are going to judge... but they don't really have a good reason to.  The heart wants what it wants.  You are at a different point in your life and so is she, but that can only hide the bonds that you both grew way back when.  I don't think you can get over it and feel okay about things.  I say that from my own experience with ex-girlfriends and even my very first girlfriend.  If you are the type of person to have had emotions, which you are, you weren't just using her, then you know the power of those emotions.  Breaking the spell of emotional ties isn't something that is easy for anyone -- and for most of us I'd say it's pretty damn impossible.  I suggest that you not try to resist your own thoughts and feelings as that will only give them more power.  I'm not saying to cheat on your wife either.  I'm suggesting you accept the past for what it is, but be realistic about how life has changed and the choices you both have made.

confessions,3dm1hc,Colonel26,3,Fri Jul 17 15:35:20 2015 UTC,"Well from what I am reading your step brother RAPED YOU. There isn't a specific name for it but it happens other than ""Traumatic bounding"" when a rape victim tries to justify what happened. Some people who have been molested convince themselves that they wanted it in order to make sense of the horror. It's a way of taking control back from/off the assailant. Falling in love, or making it into an act you now choose with a rapist would solve everything psychologically - everything to do with the sexual assault that is which - after falling in love - would have been seen as rough consensual sex, with you in control instead of well being Forced. It's an unconscious phenomenon that victims go through in order to reconcile an horrific event. attempt to gain some feeling of control. Rape gives victims a sense of helplessness. That's a scary world to live in, to feel like bad things can happen without any reason at any point in time. It causes a lot of fear and ANXIETY. So sometimes victims may rationalize that they wanted it and they really do care for this person. Because then they feel like an active participant, someone who had some stake in it or reason for it happening. Make sense?   The same thing happens to abused children. They can end up loving the people who hurt them and abuse them most. The human mind is very complex. It must have been especially difficult since this was the first sexual experience.                                                                                 Rape is still sex in the end(albeit not the kind you want, even if you now try to convince yourself you do), stimulating pleasure organs on a young and horny/curious teen. when people being raped actually have physical pleasure from it - it's a purely physiological response to physical stimulation - Oprah Winfrey did a show on it and said it happened to her as well. I am having a similar issue to this. I was raped by someone I trusted, a friend of mine. I went out and hung out with him, thinking we could talk or WATCH TV together. But then he started touching me and he made me do things that I wasn't ready to do. I am 18 and I was a virgin. I never had a relationship before and when this happened I felt like everything changed, I was very confused, had a lot of anxiety, but I felt like I loved him. I dont believe he ever ment me harm, He was young and taken over by his urges, I do not doubt that part of his brain just turned off. More animal that man. But I didnt want him to go to jail.  I went back to see him to tell him that I wasn't comfortable with what happened and I thought he would listen but he didn't. It happened again but I kept saying no and he wouldn't stop. I lost hope but no matter what I do I stlll feel sometimes like I'm in love with him but at the same time I feel nervous and grabing me and half pleading half yelling angerly, he told me know one would look at me the same anymore, everyone would thing im digusting because I liked it because I smilled after(in shock) and quietly left. He said he loves me, how beautiful i am, that he cant stop thinking about me....Your guy too will say anything, the sweatest words to the worst threats, if he was takin over by his lust than he will be takin over by his other emotions as well. When I told him I was talking to a friend about it he got really emotional, started acting crazy, But its so hard to avoid him since we go to the same college and are in the same field..it feels wrong and very weird that I'm in love with him. Most of the time I don't understand any of it and I wish things were different. My mind wants to force romantic thoughts. and at first I didnt think about the word rape. I did'nt want to tell anyone but eventually I did and I can start to see how fucked up the human mind is. It is incredibly hard to tell the difference between these forced coping mechanisms and MY emotions.                      People have married there rapist before. some boyfriends and husband rape their singnificant others because they are used to having sex and dont take no seriously. Please just read use the internets resources, just a little at a time. I can not tell you to tell your parents, I know i have not but one of my friends(and only person i can talk to irl about this) has told her parents about her attack. they were super supportive, they are and where worried, caring."

confessions,3dexss,SenpaiSama,3,Wed Jul 15 19:09:19 2015 UTC,"Don't feel selfish.  You're concerned about her physical and mental health.  You've been through something similar with someone you loved before and it was harmful.  I don't agree with the idea that you might be ""the common denominator.""  Most women have an eating disorder of some kind.  There are tons.  Binging/purging, restricting, over exercising, over eating, water loading, frequent gum chewing, etc.  As far as the guy who said skipping meals once in a while isn't wrong, he's half right.  Once in a while won't hurt you, but every day will certainly hurt you.  It's much ""healthier"" to cut portions from your meals throughout the day than to skip one altogether.  Have your girlfriend read this.  https://static.squarespace.com/static/5320692fe4b057ce8edb70ff/t/53b455f8e4b0ecd304551b90/1404327416576/Appendix_The+Wood-Burning+Stove.pdf  Also, even though BMI is an outdated and incorrect indicator of mass, that's more so true when someone is on the heavy side.  BMI does not account for fat vs. muscle.  However, just because someone is more muscular does not make them healthier and just because someone is more fatty does not make them less healthy.  Food intake is MORE important than exercise.  But balance is the best route of all.  However, your girlfriend being at the bottom base of healthy (almost ""underweight"") make me think she's probably become overly body conscious and self conscious.  That's the real issue and, unfortunately, all the love and appreciation from you won't change that.  That's something she has to work on herself, but she's going to have a really hard time seeing it and admitting it if she's right in the middle of all these ""I need to lose weight"" thoughts.  Take it from me, personal trainer, nutrition aficionado, and recovering bulimic, restricter, and over exerciser."

I'm sorry for not putting that down accurately enough. I don't know her exact weight (She guards it agressively) but if I had to guess I'd say 60kg? She's 159cm.   You're right that all the love and appreciation from me won't change the way she thinks. That's been incredibly clear to me the last couple days. She keeps dropping hints that she thinks she's too fat and I try to reassure her that she isn't, because... She isn't. She asks for a lot of reassurance that I think she's attractive as well and to me she's the most beautiful woman in the world and I love her to bits and I tell her every single day.

Not to be rude but when you say healthy, do you mean a BMI under 25?  Around 20/21 is probably ideal for looks.  My friends will often say a girl is healthy when she's clearly overweight.  What they think is normal is skewed because they come from big families or don't have a great idea of what is healthy.  Try and be understanding.  Even if you think she doesn't need to lose weight, she may want to do it for her own reasons.  It's important to feel good in your own body.  Try and support her as best as possible.  If she's going to do it, make sure she's doing it right. Eating healthy, well portioned meals and getting exercise is better than just cutting meals out of your day."

In other words, if it tells you you're healthy but you look like a tub of goo, you should probably take a look at your diet.  Only dudes like The Rock register as overweight/obese while being healthy.  Although healthy is actually a little misleading since those people would still be at higher risk for joint problems."

confessions,3dexss,q31,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:21:27 2015 UTC,"No matter what she's going to want to lose weight and you can't change that. So you should find another healthier route she can take. Eating less is fine but skipping meals is not. Tell her to have small meals throughout the day. Or tell her to fast, fasting is actually healthy for humans in moderation. If you fast once or twice every other week that should help lose weight. But the recommendation I would give is to build muscle. Eat healthy and with slightly more protein coupled with weight training can help a lot. The effects aren't immediate but it is healthier in the long run. Having more muscle increases your metabolism which let's you burn fat throughout the day."

If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: “For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.” No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭8:31-39‬ ‭NIV‬‬ http://bible.com/111/rom.8.31-39.niv"

I dont have much to go on but It is possible that your oil pressure is low due to either low oil level and/or a clogged filter.  Has it been a long time since you changed the oil?  First of all, DO NOT run the car with that low oil pressure light on, you will do serious and permanent damage to the engine.   You need to take a paper towel out to the car with you and pull the OIL dipstick and see what the level is... there should be a yellow or black ring for you to pull on and it will pull out a long stick and on the end it will tell you where the level should be.  Look on the stick and see where the oil is in relation to the marking on the end.  Wipe it off with the paper towel and do it again to confirm.  If it is low on oil, get some at an autoparts store and add it to the engine.  If the oil level is OK but it has been a long time since you had the oil filter changed, you may want to get the car in to have the oil and filter changed.  This could alleviate the problem.  If not I am sorry to say it could get expensive.  Although it is relatively rare for engine driven oil pumps to go out, though it does happen."

I checked it this morning. The oil level was fine and I just got it changed Friday. I'm concerned those guys messed it up. It didn't come on again when I revved it so I called a German auto place. They couldn't get me in this morning so now I'm at my local lube place, where they have been good to me.

It's entirely possible to consume porn in a healthy manner that does not negatively impede anyone's day-to-day lives, but a general culture of prudeness and disrespect of sexual fetishes is a constantly negative, pervasive problem that people have to deal with. It has negative implications all around, from demonizing non-heteronormative sexualities to allowing the UK government to gain complete control over online communication under the guise of ""controlling porn"".

I could talk for days about how the straight/gay dyad is historically, oddly unprecedented, but I think my main motivator and source of depression is limerence over my ex.

confessions,3d5xb7,Pandazuko,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:32:43 2015 UTC,"I just did five years ago and went back recently. Apparently my ADHD got worse so they suggested I start taking adderall. It's evened me out a lot. I've stopped with the constant casual sex. I used to abuse adderall recreationally but now I only use it therapeutically and I think having the mental structure has led me think in a way that promotes not binge drinking or heavily using cocaine. I'm interested in hypersexuality being a symptom though. I think that is interesting since I haven't been single since around fourth grade (I know!), so I was experiencing a huge rebound effect, though maybe some of that was innate.

I met this girl a few weeks ago, we hit it off amazingly and kissed etc that night but couldn't go to where each of us were staying so left it at that. She lives 2 hours drive away. After texting for a few weeks she demanded I come and visit and it was to be ON. I'd even get hard just texting her and flirting. So I drive all the way up there, all is good, we are fooling around, i'm getting hard on and off. We go to bed and boom. Dead as a dodo. WHAT THE FUCK LITTLE GUY. She goes down on me. No dice. Semi hard at best even though it feels amazing. SO yea I go down on her and that's about all that happens.   Next morning I wake up with a raging morning hard on. She gives me more head and then climbs on top. and then I feel it...it's wilting. Sure enough, down it goes. I drove home later that day and despite her saying I am amazing, i'm left feeling like absolute shit.  It's never happened before, and like you said I think it has to do with feeling a bit 'not good enough'. This girl is successful, smart, funny and hot as. I feel inferior and wonder what the hell she sees in me haha. I couldn't stop thinking the whole time we were having sex (or trying) and I couldn't absorb into the moment.  Dude, is there a reason why you can't see her again? I've heard honestly it's not that big of a deal to girls if you 'fail' the first time. Try again, and even maybe meet up and NOT have sex so there's less pressure. You said she thinks your the hottest ever or whatever, and she let you go down on her which means the barriers are down, I think she'd definitely be up for another crack. Don't feel too bad hey."

I had a similar thing happen to me when I was put on Lexapro when I was a bit younger though instead of being overtly sexual (I was a teenager so I was kinda already like that) I began to steal things and just do anything I wanted with little to no fear for the consequences. The way I had it explained to me was that this loss of inhibition is (in some cases) part of the reason that they warn that antidepressants can cause an increased risk of suicide, because what little inhibition you had against it is now gone. I mean, don't quote me on any of this because it was just my personal experience on a different drug, and what I was told after.   Like I said, you should talk to your psychiatrist.   I'm sure old me wouldn't like new me   I know that feeling intimately. Luckily a change of meds was all it took to turn things back around for me."

Maybe she really doesn't hate you.  I'm always for giving your woman a chance instead of just writing her off. When it really doesn't work, it's not meant to be.

As a parent I know I would have been wondering for years and years how and why someone would do that to my son's memorial. It would drive me crazy, and be so painful. This letter would help me to have that closure.  edited to add: I have worked with parents who have suffered the loss of a child. One of the most difficult things for them is that because no one knows what to say everyone just skirts the issue, and hopes that if they act like nothing is wrong the parent won't feel sad. The parent will always feel sad-- the wound is always there. They learn to live with it, but it never goes away.  One of the hardest things for those parents though is the sense that their child has been forgotten-- that they are the only one who remembers them, because everyone is too afraid to bring up memories of their child.  I think your memories of their son as a good, happy, caring person would bring them a lot of comfort and happiness. If you have more memories of that sort I would share those with them."

The other party is by default a secondary consideration because they don't get a say in whether they want it or not.  I won't tell you not to.

Perhaps part of you was angry at him for leaving this world. For leaving you behind so unexpectedly. Maybe you wanted some freedom after being haunted by his absence, and tried to deface his grave an attempt to show yourself that you have moved on.

But when I want my feet to look pretty I head to the nail salon and get a pedicure with the callous wrap treatment. Those things are fucking amazing.

It's fruit acid based and you soak your feet for two hours and then 4-7 days later ALL the dead skin peels off of your feet in SHEETS, revealing nice smooth skin. The tops of my feet where here are no callouses peel like a mild sunburn, as your healthy skin is unaffected. The peel's not painful at all, the skin revealed isn't raw at all, and the product costs about 10-15 dollars. You do once a month for the first two months then every 2-3 months for maintenance. I am also a picker and omg that satisfaction!   The product is really popular over at r/asianbeauty and I'm sure you can find some imgur albums detailing the peeling process O___O"

Do you have to tell him that you no longer love him? I would, but if you are so truly terrified of communicating with a person you supposedly care about, you can just tell him you want to be free to explore your romantic fantasies.

confessions,3cf67n,Colonel26,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:27:51 2015 UTC,"I wish it were that simple. Four years ago she made the decision to sleep with someone else while we were together. Four years ago, I chose to take her back after finding it too difficult to walk away. For four years, I've been regretting this decision, however I've always felt like I was in too deep with her to leave. We tried to work it out, we did. We still try, constantly. We talk about it when appropriate.   There is a part of me that wants it to work. I know there is.  But the rest of me knows that I'm wasting my time, waiting around to become happy. I'm being disingenuous when I say that she thinks things are wonderful. She knows where we are but she is further along in the rebuilding process than I am.   Since this happened, she has truly become a different person. I don't think she would ever do it again, but to be honest I don't care. The feeling of excitement that I get from knowing that I am committed to the decision of leaving next year is like nothing I've ever experienced.   I'm using this year to prepare, not to try to make it work. We are beyond that; I am beyond that.   It feels good to talk about this here. I don't have many friends I can talk to about this kind of thing, and my best friend hasn't had a girlfriend so he doesn't really give the best support.   I would prefer that the responses to this don't bombard me with ""she cheated, gtfo, you're dumb for staying,"" etc. I know. I've heard it all, I've thought it all before.

confessions,3cf67n,Colonel26,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:24:20 2015 UTC,"Well congratulations man!  I'm happy for you if you've got a plan that will allow you to become more fulfilled in life.  My only comment that I will make is that my gf and I have been together for 6 years, she came from a small town and was extremely sexually inexperienced at 23.  Now we are 30 and have a very healthy, secure relationship.  Recently I've encouraged her to play with a few select other guys, as well as other girls.  She was very hesitant at first, but is now extremely grateful, and after having had a few MFM 3somes, and a couple FFM 3somes, she feels extremely sexually liberated, and we have fun together with it.  The purpose of telling you that story is that human sexual monogamy is not naturally occurring, it is a social construct.   Your girlfriend made a mistake 4 years ago, which of course was the wrong thing to do and I'm not excusing that, but at the same time we are ALL susceptible to temptation, and making mistakes, especially when it comes to sex.  At this point in your life, you may or may not choose to break up with her in a year, but either way you need to 1) find a way to forgive her so that you don't harbor that resentment that negatively affects you,  2)  acknowledge and actualize that sexual monogamy is a very tough thing to do, especially for young people, and 3) also realize that you have a 'third' option of sorts, which is to remain with her and open up your relationship so that you can be on 'even' terms."
confessions,3cf67n,Colonel26,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:09:42 2015 UTC,"It's funny you say that, because after dealing with this internally I've come to accept that monogamy is an unrealistic human expectation, and it's allowed me to live with her relatively peacefully for this long. That being said, I mentioned that I need to discover my independent self, and to do so, I think I need to detach myself from the relationship.   I know that my unhappiness is stemmed from what she did, but I also know that I am unhappy because as long as I am with her, I will only know us, and never know me.

I've been with girls that looked were so average that I looked like a 10 next to them, and girls so beautiful that I felt like a 5 next to them. When I was the more attractive one I would get looks all the time from girls much prettier than my girlfriend, but I knew that they didn't have what made me love her, her personality. Plus she wasn't made any less beautiful by other women being more attractive in her vicinity. On the flip side of that, I've had times where guys would be checking her out and I'd feel self conscious and stupidly say something like ""Wow you sure are getting checked out by some Brad Pitt looking mofos."" And she'd say something like ""Yeah but I'm not going to dinner with and probably having sex with THEM later am I?""  I guess what I'm saying is that maybe you feel like he's out of your league physically, and hell, maybe he even knows it, but it doesn't matter because to him you're the most beautiful, the most interesting, the most perfect fit for him and as long as you two are happy together you always will be. It's easy to get upset about your looks when you're with someone who looks like God knew exactly what your type would be and made them, believe me I know, but it's usually just all in our heads. Now go, tell this man you love him and bask in each other's beauty and realize how lucky you are to be together."

What is it like to be with someone who really finds you ideal? I bet its nice. To other people we probably look like a physically well matched couple. Objectively we are probably both 7-8s.

For example, I sent him a picture of 4 beautiful naked young women and asked him to order them best to worst. He picked the one with a body furthest from my body type, even though the other 3 were pretty comparable to me.  The girls he likes in porn are so much better than me, and he never seems to get sick of them. Sex has become much less frequent (about once a month now). and he has never told me he loves me.

Liking a certain type of person in porn vs. real life is okay and that's actually true for plenty of people. I wouldn't hold that against him.  If you want him to say he loves you more, perhaps approach him about that? Or even have an honest conversation about how you feel and maybe he'll set your fears to rest or confirm them. One way or the other, I believe honesty and communication are almost always the best route.  Good luck."

But I agree with what some others here have said, sit down and have an honest, straight discussion with him about your feelings and where the relationship is. Also, and this is just spitballing, maybe he's depressed and that's effecting things more than you know. I was with a girl and I was depressed and barely wanted sex and she felt similar feelings to what your feeling. Again just talk to him heart to heart, it might be hard but it seems like what needs to be done in your case.  About being somebody's ideal of beauty, it's a mixed bag. On one hand if you're with somebody who also loves you it's awesome, they tend to just remind me how handsome I am on top of being a good S.O. On the other hand, if they got with me only because my looks, they tend to latch on physically but not emotionally. I've actually been told something along the lines of ""If you weren't mad attractive I wouldn't be with you. Stop laughing, I really wouldn't. You're boring and we have nothing in common."" So on your bet that it's nice, I suppose... sometimes? It depends on the other person, but frankly I'd rather be with somebody that I like being around and likes being around me who just finds me at least attractive enough to be satisfied."

And even worse, he started pointing out every single possible flaw I had, I guess to try to make himself feel better, but obviously it made me feel worse. He was much more attractive than he gave himself credit for, until his fun personality turned so negative and I was tired of looking at his cute face because of the bitter expression he wore. Now he's dating someone who is way below his level and is dragging him down to hers, I feel bad for how his life is going because I still care about him even though I don't love him.

Accepting oneself or loving oneself unconditionally is probably the hardest challenge in a life time. There are lots of books about it, many employ different takes on this whole issue and some might be more helpful than others.

confessions,3cgpvj,CarissimiRBeast,3,Tue Jul 7 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"That's your problem, you're viewing religion as only Christian or Athiest, with no inbetween, Eastern/extinct religions, or cultural bleeding. You gotta remember that organized religion was created by humanity, not ""God"" or ""Gods."" The Bible, Koran, etc. were all written by humans and their word perverted for personal gain over the years. So why would you believe that there's a counter-diety to this? How would you know for sure that their is Satan and that anything you do will change his opinion (keep in mind that personifying dieties with human traits in religion made by humans is kind of a stretch) of you? What if there is only one true God and no Satan? You'd just be wasting time and looking dumb. Or what if there was hundreds of dieties that humanity would never know about with a mix of evil/good alignment? The answer is don't think about it. You literally can't know, man. It's impossible.

confessions,3cgpvj,JanuaryJoe5,2,Wed Jul 8 04:43:24 2015 UTC,"Im gonna try my best here to not start a war because I truly don't mean to. You are going to make the decisions you make and I can't stop you but I at least want to give you my opinion on things.   I am a Christian. I was baptised when i was 9, and I go to a Christian school (i'm a senior) because I want to. I believe that God doesn't allow us to have the fame or riches that others have because if we had it, we wouldn't need God. God lets us hit rock bottom so that we can see him more easily. I'm saying this because your post here says to me at least that you're uncertain about your new way of life. You had to tell someone and you were possibly looking for help. Another personal opinion of mine is that if you're too scared or nevous to tell even your loved ones about your newfound religion, then maybe you should reconsider it. Again, I want to reaffirm that I am not trying to start any fights, but I feel obligated to leave a comment stating things from my perspective.   The last thing I want to say is that one of my best friends used this senior quote when he graduated a few years back. ""If everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane"".  And of course it has two meanings one being wth posessions and the other with cars or some transportation, but I look at it this way: Life is hard. It always has been. For everybody. Every person has their own struggles, whether it be money or lust or what have you, we look at other people's lives and think they have it all together and figured out because they have the things we do not. If life were easy, we would not need a God. Life is difficult because without some level of difficulty it would be meaningless. What sort of quality of life do you get by constantly having everything you need all the time? Life is an adventure and sometimes we struggle. But that's just part of it.   I look forward to having a respectful and intellectual conversation with you on the topic. Please feel free to address any of my points or give me some perspective on how you're seeing things a little more in depth. Hope to hear back soon,  -JanuaryJoe5-"
confessions,3cgpvj,Jsdoom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:47:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input.  However, I think that the Christian religion often offers a rationalization for unnecessary suffering.    Take your point that suggests that ""if everything is going well for you, you are going the wrong way.""    Why does that have to be the case?  Why is it that worldly success is equated to evil, and suffering is equated to goodness?"
confessions,3cgpvj,quenishi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:21:02 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be equated with evil, but I see where you're coming from. I guess what I'm trying to say by that is, having possessions and money is a great thing, but we often make some very careless or bad decisions with what we've been given. Therefore, consider it a blessing when you have not received the wealth that your friends or coworkers have. It's all about how you look at it: the glass is half full or half empty sort of thing. You can say that God must not be a good God because you have financial trouble or don't drive a Benz or have a $500,000 house. OR, you can say that you've been blessed wth a family that loves you and a steady income and that you know God must be a god God because you are still breathing.   Don't get me wrong- God wants us to have success and be happy, but He also wants us to acknowledge him and thank and praise him for what he does for us.   I'm not sure what else to say, really. I guess now it's up to you to carry the cinversation because I've made my opening statement haha."

And were that third so unbelievably daft that they didn't see they were on the losing side, even not counting the creator's might?  It makes you wonder... maybe they had a point."
confessions,3cgpvj,Jsdoom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:59:21 2015 UTC,"Psalm 128:2 (NAS) ""When you shall eat of the fruit of your hands, You will be happy and it will be well with you.""  These words come out of the mouths of the people who worship the one who you despise. Are you not happy with the fruit of your labor? You should ask yourself what you can do to WORK for those millions of dollars. Calling upon evil for help or engaging in evil is not working or earning anything. It means you are engaging in evil that includes lies and deceit which you despise. You then, become the hypocrite.  Religion is far from docile. It conquers evil through the power of emotion and thought. Right now you are very weak. You have no ability to fight. God helps but he doesn't give handouts. It is clear that you cannot even fight for yourself. Perhaps you should start to fight before evil conquers you in this docile state. Fight to maintain your prudence. Have discipline. It is too easy to be evil. Where is the fight in that? I am concerned you have given up.  You need to have a conversation with yourself, a real one where you look inward at the life you have led. That conversation should not include the devil or God, although God will be there with you whether you acknowledge it or not. Focus on why you are so angry. What have you chosen in your life to make you so angry?   Every choice you've made has been free. If you believe that God does not deliver, then you are clearly responsible for your own actions and the decisions that have brought you to this point.  I can tell you from personal experience, that no good will come to you from the path you seem to be headed down. Be prepared for psychological attacks, strange noises in your home, your family being terrified by beings they've never seen before, and possibly physical violence.  I hope the best for you."

All these women you've been having conversations with and entertaining just because you think you deserve to get into their pants. But you'd never actually tell them this. Instead you're devious.   How about start treating everyone as human beings, distinct, with flaws and personal interests. Get to know people and allow them to get to know you. Work on your flaws. Meet new people and enjoy new experiences. Fill your life up with activities and hobbies.   Eventually you'll stop being an asshole because you'll have such a full life you won't have the time to be manipulative. It's not a direct way to fix all the emotional issues you've accumulated but it will indirectly help you move forward.  Also, if you have the money (and you made it clear you drink port so clearly the image you're conveying suggests you should) go see a psycho analyst. And have the courage to stick with it."

Looking at the situation from different perspectives will give you the ability to make the best possible decisions. But, if you happen to screw up, admit it, at least to yourself.

I can tell you from personal experience that you don't know what things your partner is hiding, and they may be turned on by some of the things you are or even have wilder things to try.  BTW, you seem to think that your fantasy is wrong.  It is not.  Some of it may be too far for most and not realistic to do with 99% of the people, but it is not wrong."

I have been this was since I was about 12/13 (no doubt a lot like you). I used to think that it was porn that developed these desires in me but I think that was a naïve appraisal. In truth I think ones sexuality is inherent and it is only in the last couple of years that I have ‘given myself a break’ about it.  Despite what society might think of my preferences I know I am a nice, moralistic man who holds down a good job and would never harm anyone. I have been in a relationship for 11 years with a fairly ‘vanilla’ partner  and over the last couple of years we have been having more and more conversations about me finding an outlet for my sexuality (she has always known I was kinky). Long story short, I recently told her I wanted to see a dominatrix. She took this information well but in the end we decided that we should try things together. She now fists me on a regular basis (which we both enjoy) and we are trying to build up with stuff for her. The worry (and I am sure you can empathise), is that for characters like us we always want more. For the moment I am more sexualy content than I ever have been but still feel the urge to explore more. I suppose the moral of my story is, open up with your partner.  If you are truly made for one another you should be able to be fully candid and try things out with oneanother. Would be happy to chat things through more if it would help so PM me if you like."

Having a college education is simply a social construct, it doesn't actually validate anything other than the person had a enough money to go there and had the (relatively useless in the real world) ability to pass tests.  I've known people with PhD's that have had to take a job as a manager at Burger King because they couldn't find work, and I've known a 'non-educated' guy who made big money by working his way up at a sewage treatment facility and became a millionaire from his very modest investments.  Which one would you rather be?   An 'uneducated' millionaire who retired early or a PhD working at a fast food joint?  Would you rather be someone who actually made it, or someone who has a piece of paper hanging on their wall when they get home at night smelling like fry grease? The joke is on them, my friend, not you......you just haven't realized it yet because you are stuck in something known as 'poverty mentality'.   This dichotomy I've laid out for you should be  a reality check, and it's now up to you to move past it.  Furthermore, if after accepting this reality you still feel the need to 'prove it to yourself' that you are smart enough, then there is nothing stopping you from taking night classes now and finishing your degree....you can certainly afford it.     You say owning the mistakes is hard.......and it certainly is.  But own them, not only so you can internalize and actualize how far you've really come, but so that you can contribute to and inspire others who are in similar situation to the one you used to be in.  Whenever you are feeling sorry for yourself, do something for someone else, it will always make you feel better."

As in, you can be practically arrested for hurting someones feelings.  8)  Did the United States of America exist similar to how it does here or was it structured completely differently?    9)  Is racism still a huge issue like it is here?  10) If, in your world, you were from the United States, is illegal immigration a huge issue like it is here?

No lingering side effects because the only thing to really make the transition is your brain activity from your conscious and subconscious mind. I have been here for 10 months now. The only real drastic change I've ever noticed was a previous reality where I was living on a completely different continent with a different name. As it turned out, my parents were no longer living and I was adopted. Not entirely, there is plenty of unrest due to financial problems, but then again, I have been gone for so long, who knows how it truly is now. Economies are quite fragile. Yes, but our people are not as silly to think that GMO is a bad thing. Genetics are just a foundation to be built upon, they're not the be all end all. They are designed to be modified, like building blocks. Not at all, everyone here is so worried about others feelings and their own. Where I'm from, it's more insulting to not speak your mind. We believe the only way to better yourselves is to adhere to polite, yet harsh criticism. How else do you plan to learn from your mistakes? Almost identical. The only difference is that every elected position has a shelf life of only 8 years.  No. People here cling to the shreds of the past too tightly. As if calling yourself an African American is a privilege or ancient title. Do you know what we call ourselves? Humans. That's it. No it isn't. There are protocols and security for such things.

As in do you know the basic scientific principle of how it works?  What actually allows the transfer to actually take place?  2) How did you get recruited to take part in this experiment?  Was it highly controlled by the government at a secret facility or was the general public aware of this?  3)  What other cool technology did you guys have that we don't have yet?    4)  You said you've been to 5 worlds total including ours and your original world.......what were the other 3 like?  Were there any drastic differences in the other 3 that you recall?  5) Do you know anything about the value of precious metals on your home world?  Were Gold and Silver extremely valuable like they are here?  6)  What about extra-terrestrial life?  Has first contact with a sentient species been made on your home world or the other 3 you have visited?  7) What are you plans going forward? Even though it is unlikely, do you hope to 'transition' back to your home world at some point?  8) This is an odd question.......but what are the cars like on the other worlds?  Are they identical?  Like a Ford Mustang and a Chevy Corvette, and a Nissan GTR are all the same here as they are there?  Or are they completely different?     9)  How old are you?  10)  Has anyone from our government been to visit you to ask you about this experiment?"

One that I can pull from the top of my head was holographic telecommunications. It's like a video conference call but with a 360 degree model of the person you are speaking to. It's a novel form of technology, but what isn't these days? Aside from being on a completely different continent, nothing of significance. Different world leaders, varying levels of technological advancements, but nothing drastic like dinosaurs or flying cars. Gold is a valuable metal but mostly because of its conductivity. We have a smelting process that hardens softer metals. No context but we have found remnants of life on Mars in the form of single cell organisms still frozen within the north glacier of the eastern hemisphere.

Like, do you see yourself getting gender reassignment surgery someday, or do you just prefer women's clothing and dress conventions?  All too often people assume that if you have an affinity for women's clothing, you must also want to be a woman. As a man who both cross-dresses and has no intention or desire to ever undergo gender reassignment surgery though, whenever it comes up I make a point of noting that men who cross-dress are not always transgendered.

It is widely known that going through chemo is usually a terrible experience. They probably feel alone and well.. Their whole life's practice of endurance building, weathering storms, etc could be tested. And they might fail that test, even if they don't fail specifically to the cancer. So reaching out doesn't seem outlandish.  It is also probably the easiest way to tell everyone you care about (and/or cares about you) without having to freaking SAY IT each time.

With males it's mostly obvious and self explanatory.  If it gets hard you're heading in the right direction and if stuff comes out you're done.  Our sex organs are more accessible too.  We also tend to be less phased by external struggles that could throw a woman off her game.  I know it's pretty easy for me to get in the right mindset but have heard it is not so easy for many women.  It would help if they didn't cut pieces off our genitalia though.

Nothing wrong with a co-star, but don't make the movie about girl power when the series has an already established theme.  I hate it when they push an agenda just for the sake of pushing it..............kind of like how they want to make Idris Elba the next James Bond.   I love Idris Elba, I think he's a great actor.....but it's James Bond.   James Bond and Superman have always been white, and they should always be white for the next 350,000 years until the Sun goes super nova. Also, it's like you can't make a video game these days without including a gay character.  When I grew up playing video games, sexual orientation was never even an issue or a factor (because it was irrelevant), but now they make it a fucking focal point and it's disgusting. What next? Are they going to have Spider Man come out as being a Tranny?"

Extrapolating that argument, the following sexual acts would also be unnatural:   Sex while using a condom/dental dam/diaphram/sponge. Sex while on birth control hormones. Sex after a woman has had a hysterectomy. Sex where either partner is known to be sterile (due to age, medical condition, choice, etc.). Sex based on menstrual cycles aimed at avoiding pregnancy.   This might be taking the argument too far, but if the only sex that is natural is procreative sex, it would be unnatural to not ask when the female partner last menstruated, to ensure she is at maximum fertility.

It's not like they have any legitimate concern that the population is waning and we need to survive as a human race and that gay people are somehow an impediment to that.

confessions,3bao3u,Austinswill,10,Sun Jun 28 01:31:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to be ""backlashing"" at the wrong part here. You are unfortunately misinformed about science and evolution.   Homosexuality DOES go with procreation and the survival of the human species. This is for several reasons, all of which have been and are being explored and verified by science.  1) Sex in humans serves many purposes beyond procreation (although ultimately it supports species survival). In some species sex is horrible. Some male beetles literally stab their semen into the abdomen of females; cats have a barbed penis that painfully locks itself into place; etc. But in other species, sex serves as a social bonding activity. This was absolutely crucial for early humans - we needed to stay together to survive, and one of the huge motivating factors that got males to stick around was the constant hetero-/homo-sexual pleasure they could get from the group. It also bonded group members closer together, which increased community cooperation, acts of support and empathy, etc. We would probably not be here as a species if not for pretty liberal sexual acts on the part of our ancestors.  2) Genetically, genes associated with homosexuality in males have also been associated with increased fertility in females. To spare you the economics, this natural variation is beneficial because adding female fertility to a population hugely outweighs the consequence of subtracting some male fertility. That, combined with the social benefits of having gay males around (see below), allowed our species to thrive in ways that it would not have otherwise.  3) Groups of humans benefit from having healthy individuals who want to help further the community's goals but don't participate in the breeding pool (again, this advantage is somewhat more pronounced for males than females). Many cultures have 3rd and 4th genders dedicated to this type of person, and again you can show biologically that it is advantageous - for the survival of the species - for them to exist.  4) Homosexuals can have children perfectly well. Historically most homosexuals also had heterosexual partners (and many of what we would today call heterosexuals had homosexual partners). Skipping forward to ""modern"" times (the start of recorded history), our societies were fundamentally built on the legitimate male line. Illegitimate children were difficult to deal with, a drain on society, and (although I'm sure they were perfectly great people) just generally caused a lot of problems. Thus, it was beneficial for both men and women to get sexual pleasure from same-sex individuals, fulfilling their need for sexual release while not creating a bunch of unwanted children.   5) Homosexuality clearly evolved to exist, and is present in many other species. Some have a certain part of their population exclusively homosexual (often roughly 10%, like humans). Others, most famously bonobos, engage in a variety of homosexual acts for bonding, conflict resolution, dominance issues, etc.  6) Thinking that something is ""natural"" only if it results in procreation is far too narrow. Almost everything in our brain evolved to increase our survival, but each thing wasn't directly meant to make more babies. Using tools, developing language, forming societies, etc all hugely increase our chances of survival as a species but none of them directly result in procreation.   7) Finally, in a very strict sense homosexuality and heterosexuality don't really exist. All science on the subject shows that human sexuality exists on a spectrum, with people preferring a huge variety of different things to different extents. This is a totally natural variation, similar to the way we all have different heights or slightly different hair color. It is very beneficial for a species to be diversified in this way, because you never know what the next environmental challenge will be and you need to be flexible enough to adapt to anything.   Sorry if this is long, but the tl;dr is that homosexuality is as beneficial to humans as any other evolved trait, both genetically and economically, and scientifically speaking is perfectly natural in any sense of that word."

So being able to have kids is not the only biological relevant thing you can do especially for humans as a social species.   Also,  just because offspring is the GOAL doesn't mean that every single member of that species should procreate.

With that being said, here's why I do not believe that it is not natural in the sense of survival for the human race. Women have eggs and men have sperm for a reason, and that is to procreate. As for people who are infertile, I think it's unnatural because it doesn't go with the purpose of procreating. I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with infertile people. However, if it were to be natural, in the sense of the survival of the human race, men and women will have both functional productive organs."

confessions,3bcn0a,Pewbsicle,13,Sun Jun 28 17:14:08 2015 UTC,"Man I feel like you've become paranoid. I don't know a wedding that wasn't considered ""beautiful"" or ""true love"" gay or straight...  Okay, there was this one wedding I attended that was in 100 degree heat and the bride and groom's mothers hated each other and the other side of the wedding party was getting trashed but we weren't allowed any alcohol. And the only wedding decoration was a blow-up palm tree. But had that wedding been between two dudes, I think everyone would have equally proclaimed it the nightmare it was. ANYHOW.  I've been thinking about that domestic terrorist/racist who shot up all those people in a church. People have been saying that he started believing that everyone was out against the white people after so many people attacked the bias and prejudice of the Trayvon Martin thing and so forth.  What do we tell these people so that they can get a true sense of perspective? What do I tell you, someone who now believes that people think ""heterosexual feelings are dirty,"" when this is clearly not the case?  You've delved too deep into the regions of the Internet that build their viewership over the contempt of identities that you share. And now you are so misshapen in your view of things, mistaken in what and who is being persecuted, that you are delusiounally swinging in the air. I fear this is the future for many people who are non-minorities: constantly finding new phobias on the Internet by overinterpreting hyperbole and taking too personally other people's places for venting.  So, in short, women are not one identity. Some women like people with charisma, others don't care so much. Heterosexual feelings are typically not thought of as dirty; consult practically any movie out there, especially the Dreamworks/Disney variety. Nobody wants you to hide your feelings, but you really ought to work out your problems with professionals or on your own rather than expecting these unsuspecting people to be the brunt of your poor-thought-out dogma. Cat-calling is poor behavior through-and-through, but the reason people get more irritated about men doing it to women is because it happens all the time to the point where women feel intimidated. If you feel intimidated if and when it happens to you, I am sure they'd implore you to call those people out on it. You weren't not ""born with the qualities that women look for in a man"" because all women don't have the same taste. It doesn't suck to be you; you live in a world of privilege and wondrous things around you, an Internet that is a deep well of interesting things. There's theme parks and states with legal drugs and great works of art being made constantly and you are in your room sulking. Frankly I don't understand the hypocrisy of ""it's extremely hypocritical to support gay people just because they're gay while anytime I bring this subject up I get a lecture on womens' rights and how bad it is for them."" And nobody believes that straight weddings are not ""beautiful"" while gay ones always are.  Finally, very few people think heterosexual relationships are sexist. People do talk about men and women in love all the freaking time. Yes, the media attention is on gay rights but that's just the current trend of news. You aren't being persecuted."

There are guys for whom it's ok because they're hot and tall and know exactly what to say and how to say it.   It's not ok for me because I am not any of those things. I think it's easy for somebody who has some success with women to ignore all these negative messages about how all men do is ruin womens' lives but I have no positive examples so all I'm left to do is gradually build a longer and longer list of what not to do, like, don't talk to women on the street, don't talk to women on the subway, don't talk to women at work, don't repeatedly text, don't this and that. In the end all I can do is watch women from a distance, watch them get picked up by these guys who know what they're doing, but if I try to do the same thing, I will get in trouble, because I'm not tall, rich, handsome, charismatic. So effectively, heterosexuality is illegal for me.  If I try to have a normal conversation with a woman we will have a normal conversation and then she will go and fuck some 6 foot tall hipster. I never had a chance. If I make my interest explicit she will laugh at me and roll her eyes and then go and fuck the 6 foot tall hipster. There is no winning."

I'm getting married in two weeks and I think weddings and love are beautiful no matter the genders. Everybody I know holds these same views (apart from the few homophobes I know). The more you think like this the more bitter you'll become and the less women will want to speak to you. It doesn't matter about physical attractiveness, negative people are easy to spot and will be immediately turned down no matter their gender or sexual orientation or what.   This really doesn't seem to be about gay marriage or sexual orientation at all. It's about you being rejected by women.  Start working on trying to learn to love life, and love yourself.

I've seen pretentious stuff floating around the interbuts that max doesn't talk much because he's ""learning to talk"" after being quiet for a long time (probably from people who hasn't watched the old ones) which imo isn't the case since he has always been a very quiet character. However the old movies are a little bit of a snore-fest compared to fury road. I am not particulary fond of the old movies but fury road is one of my favorites of all time. so anser is yes if you wan't to know more about max and no if you just want to enjoy the movie and don't contemplate to much on why max is the way he is I supose:D"

The parent's will love the child (most of them unfortunately), but the kid itself would never have a normal life and maybe even get bullied. And die way earlier.

confessions,3azzdy,Jlad0126,2,Wed Jun 24 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"My parents are the same way. They believe some kind of god figure exists, but they never go to church anymore because they dislike the whole organized religion. I think there was a change of pastors and they really didn't like the new one. Either way, they don't see a point to it now.  I believe that if there is a god, he isn't all-powerful or all-controlling. The reason I left the religion was because I was sick of people telling me that ""the Lord works in mysterious ways"" when I had a seriously traumatizing event happen in my life. (Thankfully, my parents were not among those who said that.) Also I wondered what kind of an all-knowing god would just let that happen, not just to me, but to anyone."
confessions,3azzdy,PoopymanV,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:11:11 2015 UTC,"I feel ya.  But perhaps I can suggest to you a slightly different perspective:  God is not a 'dude' with a white beard that sits up there.  God is an all-knowing collective intelligence and an infinite energy field that is a collective creative consciousness, and we each have a little tiny piece of that within us.  Sort of like if God is the beach, then we are the grains of sand that compose it.  Therefore we as the individual grains have ""Free Will' to live as we choose.  God is all knowing, but He/It doesn't try to influence your decisions or events in your life one way or another, because the Free Will is what is most important, and the whole idea is to let things unfold naturally.  Your life experience is unique, no one else has ever seen the world through your eyes, and your total life experience, whether it be positive, negative, or neutral, is all equally valid and when you die you return that entire unique experience back to the collective consciousness of God and add to the Whole, to the I Am.   So yes, 'bad' or 'traumatic' things happen, but those are just values we assign to those events while we are here on Earth.   It doesn't matter if the experience is 'Good', 'Bad', or Neutral, it is what you make it to be, and THAT is the 'Fruit of the Spirit' that grows the total experience and collective infinite that is God when you die and return to Source. When we grow spiritually, we pray and meditate and can invite the Christ/God consciousness to fill our bodies/minds/hearts/lives, and that is certainly impactful...........but we are spiritual beings having a physical experience and the number one rule here in this 3D realm is ""Free Will.""  It's an actual physical law, kind of like gravity."

What I'm calling for is to people to actively turn away from this nonsense so that the media sees the ratings sink and stops covering it.

It's important on a different level. If a celebrity like her isn't able to be herself then how are other people who struggle with the same issue able to? I don't think she's a moron and her actions do need a certain amount of attention from the world. I think it ran it's course as a news story and if people want to keep up with it they can. There's also a way for you to avoid seeing this story if you go to news outlets like BBC or NPR where it won't be front page news everyday. There's a reason the story got national attention and I believe she warrants a certain amount of respect.

That's what I have a problem with.   The people from the 'oppressed' groups, whether it's feminists, LGBT, ethnic minorities, illegal immigrants, etc....are never actually ok with stopping at actual equality......they want the pendulum to swing far past equality into the other direction, to where they are elevated and have political power and establish and super-impose their own belief systems as a 'superior' form of thinking than the currently existing structure.

confessions,3azdii,Cosmic_Bard,-2,Wed Jun 24 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"No, it's not normal.  These people account for less than 2% of the population, and it is not normal or healthy to want to amputate one's penis.  The dysphoria and/or gender identity disorder is very real, but it should be treated as the mental health issue it is.  Just as schizophrenia is treated with meds and therapy, this should be too.  We don't send schizophrenics who experience dysphoria from having multiple personalities out into the world and then tell everyone else to deal with their individual personalities as separate people.  Also, where do we draw the line on playing along with this ""I am whatever I identify as"" stuff?   If I identify as a Martian Ambassador and dress up in a space suit, should everyone else treat me as such, and refer to me as 'your eminence'?  Should the government give me special treatment and diplomatic immunity as an actual Martian Ambassador because I experience dysphoria with being a human?  If the answer is no, then why not?  How is that any different?"
confessions,3azdii,downtherabbithole-,5,Wed Jun 24 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"2% is still a very large part of the population and the culture that is built around that community is even bigger. Why do you need to treat something with medication and drugs when you can physically fulfill it and try to be yourself. I don't find myself having to ""deal with their personalities"" when I meet a transgender person. I usually just socially interact with them like I would any other person. They're not trying to terrorize the world, they're just trying to be who they feel they were meant to be. And it sucks that the current culture doesn't allow for that."
confessions,3azdii,downtherabbithole-,-5,Wed Jun 24 20:39:40 2015 UTC,"Did you actually read what I wrote?   I made the 'deal with their personalities' reference to someone who was schizophrenic.  As in, we don't send schizophrenic people out into the world and then tell everyone else to 'deal with their multiple personalities' just because we have the ability to physically fulfill it......we actively recognize schizophrenia as a personality disorder that the person is suffering from and offer them help.   I'm arguing we should do the same thing with people who suffer from 'gender identity disorder.'   We should offer them help (meds, rehabilitative therapy) instead of pretending that it's not a disorder and that it's perfectly normal to want to cut your dick off. I never said trans people are trying to terrorize the world, but the liberal media IS trying to terrorize the world by pushing the overarching Agenda and shoving it down everyone else's throats instead of just living and letting live."

Much of it was growing up in a time where things like being transgender wasn't spoken of. So here he was, growing up in a female body and knowing that something wasn't right but not having access the the vocabulary to even put into words how he was feeling. This lead to him having a very tortured life that only began to improve in the last 5+ years.   He told me that if he had someone like Catlyn Jenner when he was growing up, it might have saved him spending 25+ years of his life feeling that he was broken and alone. So to say 'who cares' is to dismiss people like my friend and the youth out there who finally feel that one day they can be an accepted member of society.   And you saying ""10 years ago this shit would've never flown"" is not an argument in your favor. There are a lot of things that X amount of years ago would never have been accepted, but that's usually not a good thing."

Like I said earlier, the dysphoria is very very real and tough to deal with.  But why is it that the dysphoria itself is not treated as a mental illness, where the person can get the support and help they need, instead of now trying to tell the other 99% of the world that as of 2014 this is now 'normal.'  It's not 'normal' to feel this way, just like it's not 'normal' to have to deal with schizophrenia.  But for people with schizophrenia we have options to treat them and help them manage their condition.  We don't send them out into the world and tell the rest of the world to deal with each of their personalities individually now do we?"

confessions,3alb0v,GunsGermsAndSteel,3,Sun Jun 21 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"Martial arts are good, not because they'll teach you how to get into a fight, but because they'll teach you how to stay out of them. If everything you try fails to deescalate the situation, THEN you'll have the tools, the confidence, and the know-how of how to end a fight quickly. Don't just pick boxing so you can learn quickly how to throw out some punches, pick an art that will help you grow as a person and, hopefully, help you realize that fighting is not what defines a man.  I've been doing various martial arts for 14 years, and now, even if someone is trying to purposefully start something with me, I don't feel insecure enough to lash back out at them. I know that if I needed to I could probably wreck a guy, but I don't want to, and I've never needed to, and so when tense situations come up I find it all the easier just to calm everyone down and leave the situation. That is a much harder thing to do than winning a fight, in my opinion, and it also allows you to keep your teeth and stay out of jail. Win!  TL;DR: Learn martial arts, it'll help you deal with your fear of fights in the best possible way."

It's lived it's whole life, not by choice, but by conscription, in your care, and it depends on you for survival, and it develops a trust with you.   You perform that role for years, and then one day completely and traumatically betray that trust and torture/kill it in the most inhumane way possible.  That's fucked up.

I found a horned toad in the back yard, dug a small hole put a leaf over him, then took aim and pierced his body with my arrow. As I picked up the arrow with the lizard skewered and dying, I realized that all things great and small were alive. I mean I knew it before but this is when it really hit me that all life was precious.

At least you know it. Hopefully going forward you won't ever do something like this again. You should probably speak with a psychologist - partially to deal with the feelings of having done it, partially to understand what was going on in your mind when you did it to make sure you never do anything like that again.   There are some crazy leaps in logic here - like, you knew it was wrong as soon as you put him in the freezer, but when the freezer didn't kill him you didn't set him free but tried even harder to kill him? ""How could I ever look at him again with him knowing I had it in me to do that too him"" - and the solution to that was to try to kill him in different ways instead of setting him free (where you would also have never had to see him)? That seems a little crazy to me. anyhing where you feel disconnected and do things that don't seem real is a red flag that you might have some psychological shit to sort out.  All that said, I guess that's the circle of life, and it's not that different to what farmers do to chickens every day...  I think it's really sad what you did, even though it is nowhere near as bad as killing another human, you need to learn from this and work to understand why you did what you did, why was that of all things your reaction to him making noise?"

These are intricately related and you're caught in a loop. Really try to reflect on that. You're human, you want attention and social approval, but you're trying to cheat the system and take a shortcut. That doesn't work, as you've learned. Shit unravels, it backfires, and you achieve the opposite of your goal. It's self-destructive behavior. But it's become your default behavior. You clearly recognize this, which is a big first step. Can you elaborate and describe your inner dialogue? What justifications do you make to yourself? While caught up in the moment, do you fail to recognize the problem until you've already lied? Or is it because you recognize the problem but think to yourself, ""this will be the lie that fixes the other lies""? Focus on maintaining your presence of mind. Pause before you say something.

But steroids aren't, and unless you are trying to get your IFBB pro card and make millions of dollars in endorsements, then the benefits don't outweigh the damage you are doing to your health and to your body. Work on meditation, contemplation.  Forgive yourself, love yourself.  Find your center, and focus on bodybuilding for the right reasons, and develop a positive self image.  If you do this, then you 1) won't care what your friends think and won't feel the need to make outrageous claims, and 2) you won't feel the need to take steroids anymore.

I can understand being frustrated that you didn't just block her or whatever, but man... when someone is intentionally saying the worst things they know to say just to get a reaction out of you.... no one should be surprised when you react.   We're all human first, before we're anything else. She pushed you to the limit, and you lashed out. I can see why it would bug you that she was successful, but don't feel like a bad person because of it. She literally got what she asked for.   I hope that going forward you can find some happiness.

I know of noone who started meth and it turning out ok. Noone. It always starts out great, always. But sooner or later, it WILL catch up to you, and you WILL look like a methhead.   I have the same complex. I want to know everything too. But that's not possible. That's life. You have to choose. That's just the way it works.   Trust me, if there were a way to do drugs and know everything there is to know, someone would have done it already.   You're a human being. Meth will not work for you, or anyone else, no matter how good you feel about everything.   One day, it's going to happen. And it's going to happen when you don't realize it's happening. And you're going to be another methhead who didn't know shit."

confessions,3ae0xg,whereismysafespace,6,Fri Jun 19 11:57:36 2015 UTC,"You're using meth instead of letting meth use you   Yes, this is always how it is in the beginning. But it is never awesome in the end. Not awesome at all. Why?   Because the reason addictive drugs are addictive is that they eventually control you. Always. There are no exceptions. I know cause I tried almost all of them.  Every single time a person becomes dependent on an addictive substance, it leads to immeasurable pain.  Since you don't seem to know this yet, I'm assuming you yourself have never been addicted to anything. If this is so, why do you speak of things you know nothing about?"
confessions,3ae0xg,k3lti3,-2,Fri Jun 19 13:26:00 2015 UTC,"I've taken stuff. Helped me through some times in my life. Haven't been addicted. So I see it as a positive overall. Just like OP seems to. Not everyone will turn up an addict.   Some people are able to just use when necessary, and stop when it's not needed anymore or when the cost exceeds the benefits. Some will sadly fall into addiction (which can happen with lots of stuff, if you look at gambling for instance some people are able to indulge in it once in a while for fun and not lose their life savings, you could also look at prescription meds, when you have a legitimate illness or pain problem that needs to be medicated with something potentially addictive, not everyone will end up addicted either).  So I'm saying if you're lucky to be able amongst the people who gets a benefit from something, why not use it? I'm not saying everyone is immune from addiction. And some people might have a better time with one substance over another (like if you're doing ok on meth I would not advise you try crack just in case it works too)."

confessions,39um1r,To-Mega-Therion,6,Sun Jun 14 22:36:40 2015 UTC,"My dad wasn't a huge part of my life and was an alcoholic all of my life and addicted to benzos due to his bad anxiety issues. He did the same exact thing your dad did. He would say horrible things to me and then call me and say I was his favorite and loved me more than anything. Christmas of 2010 i stopped talking to him again because he was harassing me. He would call and call and then finally one day he left me a voicemail saying if he ever saw me again he'd kill me and that I was a bitch, slut and I'd never amount to anything (I was in college). Then in the summer of 2011 he left me a voicemail he was dying of a rare blood cancer. I didn't believe him because he told me he was dying all the time from anything to brain cancer to lung cancer or skin cancer. He just wanted my attention. In the voicemail he asked me to reconcile because he was dying and that if I decided not to call him back, just remember the good times (there were some), and we would leave it at that. I never called back, but I did save the voicemail. In August of 2011, I got a call from his brother whom I didn't know very well and he said my dad passed away from the blood cancer. It was true. I told myself a million times I wouldn't care if he died because he hurt me so many times, but when I got that call I sobbed. It hurt so much because I realized my chance at ever actually having a dad was really gone. I knew he would never come around, but I guess I had hope. I was depressed for about a year, but I realized that my dad was never there for me, but I knew he loved me. Deep down in the small part of his brain that wasn't pickled from alcohol and drugs, he loved his kids but just couldn't be sober because the anxiety was too hard to deal with. I guess I'm not trying to give advice because for one you didn't ask, but I guess this feels good to talk about. I don't talk about it with my husband much because I don't wanna be a debbie downer. I hope that whatever happens with you and your father you find peace whether he dies soon or not. And don't feel confused if his death does make you feel sad because I really didn't think I'd be as emotional about it."

confessions,39svb6,tanman1975,9,Sun Jun 14 15:33:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP and I don't have a problem with it, but the rationale I've heard is that white men are objectifying Asian women and they only date/marry them because their race has been fetishized.  In their eyes, white men marry white (or other race) women for their minds and bodies but only marry Asians for their bodies.  One of my white best friends married a girl who's half Japanese and looks almost completely Asian and they've had a loving marriage for 10 years, but even he said that if he didn't end up with her that he would've sought out another Asian to marry.  Some may say that's racist, others may say that you can't change personal preference.  I don't have strong feelings about it either way."

confessions,39svb6,Nayelez,-2,Mon Jun 15 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"I got to know them.  I am Asian.  My sister married - and then divorced - a white man.  About half of the female members in my extended family are (or were) married to white men.  Knowing what I know now from those female relatives, I can say the foundation of white male-Asian female relationships is very unhealthy: it is based upon white male privileges and Asian women's self-esteem problem.  The white male-Asian female relationships also create many serious problems and repercussions within the Asian American communities.  The more I know them, the more ""intolerant"" I become - because I have seen how them divide and undermine Asian communities."

You feel your culture (and by extension, yourself,) victimized by white male-Asian female relationships.  I don't think this makes white men ""wrong"" here. Do you think that is the case?  There are a lot of reasons why I disagree with your assertion about these kinds of relationships, especially given where your subculture lives and resides. Dilution of a racial or cultural group  is to be expected when it exists within a larger one. I don't get why people try to prevent others from exploring their options.

There must be a good reason why he declined to use the word 'love.'  Although I only have a few words to go off of, I'll try to hazard a guess as to why he isn't making that step.  To me, it seems very strange that, despite being together for so long and being so integral in each other's lives, that your first candid discussion about the ""L-word"" came so recently, and only after many drinks.  What I can gather from this is that this relationship is suffering from a severe lack of intimacy.  Perhaps neither of you are accustomed to sharing feelings, and are thus not mature enough emotionally to understand the significance of romantic love.  I say this because in your description of the relationship you emphasize a lot of material details about the relationship (like proximity and similarity) but fail to mention some of the more integral aspects of the relationship.  You mention he has been ""with you"" through tough times, but what really matters is how was he with you!  Like, my mattress has been with me every night for the last five years and neither of us would confess it is true love.  What matters is what he did while he was lying beside you, how comfortable you felt wrapped in his arms, what things he did to show his affection for you like making the bed or changing the sheets.  Okay, maybe I do love my mattress, but don't tell her that.  What I'm trying to say here is that your relationship, though long and fruitful, may be underdeveloped.  This is not a death sentence, just a diagnosis.  I can tell by the way you feel about it that you feel an attachment to him that is deeper than you are accustomed to; an attachment that you cherish in a way you never have before.  I suspect he feels the same way.  But if you two are going to get through this as a couple, you have to be able to discuss this sort of issue over dinner, not over several drinks, or anonymously over the Internet.  I would suggest confronting him about how his admission made you feel.  But don't speak to him like it was a complaint- if you want to prove the point, make it candid and romantic.  If you need him to make the first step into love, it might help to do some hand-holding, figuratively and literally.  So get his juices flowing, get as intimate as possible, and tell him how what he said made you feel.  Maybe then he will spill the beans about how he truly feels.  EDIT: On a third read-through, I am now almost certain he himself is uncertain, or at least uncomfortable, with romantic attachment.  Perhaps pressing the issue will make him even more scared: instead of coaxing out his feelings you may just drive him away.  You know him better than I do, so exercise your own judgment.  All I can say it that the ball is in your court, and it's up to you to make this relationship what you want it to be- it's clear he either doesn't know what he wants out of it, or that he doesn't want you to know that he doesn't want the same thing you want out of it.  Either way,  communicating the issue to him is crucial."
confessions,39jov2,Ludendorff,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:27:01 2015 UTC,"You have an excellent point on the ""how is he with you"" part. I probably should elaborate on that. He is incredibly emotionally supportive of me. When I found out a friends cancer had come back for the third time, he held me while I cried for an hour, then did some research on the type of cancer and experimental treatments. When we were planning our big vacation together, he surprised me with a few days in the country that my best friend is currently teaching English in. I hadn't seen my friend in over a year and yes, I cried like a baby seeing him again. (Don't worry, he's gay so there is no love triangle there.)   He anticipates what would make me happy or what would cheer me up and does it. I almost never have to tell him how I'm feeling, he can tell almost instantly. He wakes me up from bad dreams (I have a pretty intense background and it tends to haunt me in my sleep, yes I have gotten therapy to deal with it) and soothes me in my sleep. He can tell when I'm stressed or just generally in a bad mood and will pounce on me and tickle me until I beg for mercy. In general, he does EVERYTHING right. No, he's not perfect. He has his moments when he's in a bad mood and I send him off to hang out with his friends because a night of playing D&D always cheers him up.   You're right in that this is the first time I've ever loved someone like this. I love my family and friends, but none of that could have prepared me for a romantic love. I have no idea how this is all supposed to work. He was burned by his first love to a degree that you would swear he was making it up. His friends of 20+ years have all told the same story separately to kind of warn me that though he looks like he's moved on, he definitely learned from that experience. You're right that pressing the issue would frustrate him and he would close himself off more. He seems to want this relationship to continue since he keeps including me in his future plans. Plans that aren't a few months off, but potentially a year or more off.   Oddly enough, at his friends wedding last week, he was talking to his friend about the wedding and how they all used to go to that location as kids. His friend brought up how he should get married at location X because he ALWAYS goes there. Turns out he's researched weddings there. His friends wife and I were talking later and after she had had a few drinks she said she was surprised he had talked about getting married without bursting into flames. I guess he has shied away from that topic like the plague. So at this point, I have no idea what to do."

confessions,39jov2,shades_of_nicotine,4,Fri Jun 12 07:06:17 2015 UTC,"I'm 32, he's 35. He's my first LTR because I usually cut and run after 3 months. Partly selfish, partly selfless. If I can't see myself making future plans with someone at that point (vacations, not marriage) then I know it's not going anywhere. So rather than waste my time and theirs, I cut them loose.   He's had a few relationships that have lasted several years. Some of which he's been burned by, others played upon his nature and took total advantage of him and manipulated him into staying with them long after he wanted out."
confessions,39jov2,Oleelee,3,Fri Jun 12 07:11:10 2015 UTC,"I would consider you lucky. Me personally would prefer the truth to a lie, no matter how harsh it might be. I love how he told you the truth, it must have been hard to do that, but he is a real man.  He obviously cares about you and likes you for real, else he wont let you be close with his family and friends.   He is 35. He knows what he wants. He likes you. Love will eventually happen. For some it takes a day, for some it takes a few years. So what!  If it bothers you, talk to him about it. Just dont let this ruin the good thing that you have."

I got on the scales then calculated my BMI - I was borderline underweight/normal weight.  I forced myself to eat a little more regularly and was starting to feel better about everything.  I've been on a few dates with a guy who seems really nice and decent. But I'm finding it hard to let myself think anything could happen long term with anyone. My first thought is always that he is just not that into me so I shouldn't get too attached. I don't know if it's because I don't trust guys after the bad break up with my ex, or if it's because of my mood/issues lately.  It was my birthday this weekend. I had a great day with friends (and eating lots) but today I feel depressed and fat and lonely again.  I've decided to move to live with my uncle because he will help me eat regularly. I still haven't told anyone in real life about any of this. I googled counselors in my area but haven't made any decisions. I'm hoping I can right myself before it comes to that."

This guy doesn't. He makes you anxious and you treat yourself poorly.  Something is screwy if you weren't on the same page in an LDR. It's not that hard to be clear. It sounds like he redefined when it suited him.  He thinks he can come back around as he pleases. Never bodes well for the chick.    I'm guessing you're internalizing his actions with the food. Please eat! Even if  you do want something with this fool in the future, you'll need your metabolism and your brain, both of which require eating to protect."

We spend so much time idealizing the past and turning regular people into saints that it becomes hard for people in the present to measure up to the greatness of what we think we experienced. In reality we just forget to take off our rose colored glasses.

Most likely - you're still harboring some feelings from the previous relationship and still having her in your life makes you feel as if you're doing something wrong when in reality, you're not.  It's hard during intimate relationships to not allow the chemical reaction to place some great deal of emotional dependency on the other individual ... It's almost like detoxing at this point and instead of doing that, you've merely changed substances to subside the pain/detachment (regardless of how strong it is).  As someone who's dealt with new relationship energy a few times too many and understands what that ""detox"" feels like - honestly the best thing to do is go cold turkey and cut off any influence that impacts you that way until you're good and ready... And believe me, you'll know when you're ready."

It makes you question all your presumptions and makes you excited to see what else you may have been wrong about. Why not move to a different country even?

I miss the structure. I miss learning and being graded on how well I performed academically. I miss having my mind expanded. I miss going to lunch and socializing.  Like you, I do miss my first true love. I miss that feeling of freedom with her and minimal responsibility. Although another part of me wishes I had lived more and stayed single. I miss just having that option.  Now I'm a father, I'm engaged,  I work full time, and I am pretty stressed out. My anxiety is taking a toll on my life, although it is under much better control now than before. I feel old and frail,  although technically I'm in the midst of my prime. Time is moving fast. Life isn't nearly as enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, there are good things as well, but just knowing that there is essentially no going back to that window of time makes me depressed.

Everyone seems to be thinking I'm arguing that these issues don't exist. I'm not, I even went into detail about how I understand these issues. What I'm arguing against is the unwarranted exaggeration of the issues to make them seem more pressing than they really are.   It's one thing to say male circumcision is ultimately unnecessary and meaningless. It's another to say it's a holocaust of foreskins and the mutilation of baby boys.  It's one thing to say that police department standards are too relaxed and too many bad cops are on the force which leads to many instances of corruption and excessive use of force. It's a completely different thing to say that we live in a police state and that the government is actually plotting against us.  It's one thing to say that the political system is outdated and some parties take advantage of legal loopholes to better their position. It's a completely different thing to say that the system is intentionally broken and manipulated to make you feel like your vote counts when actually everything is rigged by some covert force.  It's the exaggeration of the issues I dislike. Not the mere mention of the issues. Exaggerating the issues only makes the issues worse because if people actually begin to believe that the system is against them at every turn then they begin to feel hopeless and refuse to put any effort forth. It breeds a natural distrust of otherwise trustworthy institutions. It's not healthy to blow your problems out of proportion. It's the hypochondriac behavior of an entire society."
confessions,3950ma,rabbitspade,2,Wed Jun 10 01:40:21 2015 UTC,"Well I personally disagree with you on circumcision. I think our overall welfare is so good relative to history right now that we can't recognize a mutilation for what it is. We can't see past our own cultural blinders.  Many of the errors in history weren't fatal, and most were accepted as normal and even good, or at least benign. I think modern circumcision is one of those errors. The risks for complication are low now, with modern medicine, but the practice itself absolutely is a mutilation of the penis.  I agree in general that we could do with less hyperbole (I wonder if you'll see this as hypocritical now that I've said circumcizion is mutilation?), and many of the more ""outraged"" people don't really enact real change, but to call attention to issues like police brutality (a real thing), racial discrimination (another real thing), is good generally."

It doesn't matter if people have or worse (for example, ""OH, women get circumcised? That's nothing, some people get lobotomized!""), people having it worse is a red herring to our own problems and entirely unrelated. You probably don't care about social issues because you are likely a white straight male and none of them affect you. You will never not be hired for a job or falsely attested due to your skin color. You're entitled to feel however you want, but instead of criticising other people for caring about social issues perhaps your time would be better spent studying why they care so much."

Maybe they actually do experience as much distress in this situation as, say, a poorer person who gets their heating cut off in the middle of winter, but it still seems counter-intuitive to say any two problems are of equivalent severity."
confessions,3950ma,TheGatManz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:04:54 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly the same thing. The fallacy of relative privation simply means that the trials that someone else undergoes have no bearing on your own- ie there is no ""score board"" or ""oppression olympics"" that we're all going through. not getting priority processing at an airport isn't a serious issue for anybody regardless of life circumstances; but if someone has to go hungry 2 nights of the week versus someone else who goes 3 nights- there shouldn't be a competition, and the person who goes 3 nights does not invalidate the one who goes 2. the fallacy doesn't say anybody has the same severity of issues to deal with, only that they are not competing problems."

You've done a similar thing in the past.  However you can't fault your wife for having a friend.  Sounds like outside help is the only thing that may save this situation.

confessions,38yp11,MaiNameIsLi,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:45:20 2015 UTC,"There are some concerns on both sides here. Why did you fantasize about an affair? Were their problems then? Were you sexually frustrated? Or were you frustrated in general with the marriage and looking for a way out?   In her instance, it sounds like she was raised in a very conservative household where she might view porn as deviant behavior. If that's the case, she really should go see a therapist to help her work through fears or uneducated beliefs. The other side of that is that she's also learned sex can be used as a control factor in relationships. If she deprives you of it from all other sources, she maintains total control.   Either way, if you love her and genuinely want to remain with her, marriage counseling is in dire need. If she refuses to go, it's because she knows she's in the wrong and doesn't want to hear it. That's the point when you suggest to her that you're not sure if the marriage can survive this without counseling and you feel (don't use the word think, ideas can be argued, emotions cannot) that there are unresolved issues that need to be worked on. If you genuinely feel that she's cheating, cut your losses, wish her well and move on with your life."

It really disturbs me to the core of my being. And children are supposed to be innocent. Such a horrific thing being normalised to a person at ANY age, but 12 even more so, and them seeing 'sexy' in it just... really scares me.  It really speaks volumes about the sexualisation and dehumanisation of women in society."

My gripe is with society at large and the way it treats women. Children get caught up in that, and it makes me sad.

A lot of times once an initial post is made, people take it to PM anyway, or some other chat program.  As for ""containment"", the rest of reddit is not prepared to deal with these things and if they are, there are only so many that can be handled. They sort of trickle in to /r/confessions so it hasn't been a problem as the sub isn't overwhelmed or anything. If someone needs help, it makes sense to guide them to where they can get the most help while also offering what you can. But what can we (or any sub) really do? We can listen, and give advice.

I have had a life, let me tell you.  I grew up fast and lived in denial about my depression and anxiety. I kept my feelings hidden and didn't laugh out loud honestly for probably two years. I mean, I laughed all the time, but it was fake.   I started making stupid decisions. I cut myself a few times but quickly learned worse ways to hurt myself. I became a tad promiscuous and loved myself for it.   Last year it all came to a head when my father cheated on my mother and i, and eighteen year old was sexting my 30 yr old tattoo artist. I tried to end it.... but messed up.   It turns out I can't even do that gracefully. What I tried didn't work and I got committed for two weeks and have been medicated, regularly go to a therapist and hate my psychologist because she's an idiot. A fact which is irrelevant but necessary. She's seriously the biggest dingbat I ever met.  What I'm trying to say is, I learned a few things, tried a few things, and ultimately I feel great. Here is a few things to get you through the night: 1.Happiness is a choice, not a right. You decide how the world effects you and how you effect the world. 2. Feel how you feel, not how you're supposed to feel. Be honest with yourself. If you have a problem with yourself, the first person to tell is you! 3. Becka is cool. 4.

If you feel a need to connect to your roots. Join whatever club that is and make friends with the individuals. Just like you said you had no problem with.  Cause here is the real dirty lil secret (or not so much secret). They are threatened by you and most likely are jealous of you. I am not bullshiting you. It's the deep down honest truth. I am guessing that you are good/interesting looking. So, that's the first threat and the second is that if they exclude you they can feel like they are getting back at all the people who excluded them for being Asian (the self loathing you mentioned is directed at you).  Also, do look up Tiger Woods who had a difficult time with the same thing. He is half asian but no one would ever accept it. Why? Cause he doesn't look it. (please dont look up his affairs)  How about this? Why not use it as a secret identity.

I wasn't  excluded but those friend groups I could have been part of were exclusive to only other asians. Many of the Koreans at my Uni had pretty much their own society and would only talk to others out of necessity. Thats not something I want to be a part of so like 5% of my friends are asian. My advice is don't try to make friends with them if they want to exclude you or anyone on race. If you really do want one of those asian friends then talk to them when they aren't in their groups first because one person saying you're not asian can make the others agree. Once you get closer to a few of them then try meeting with the gatherings.  Edit:a word

Then later i moved over to California where i also live in a heavily populated Asian area (Little Saigon) to ""get in touch with my roots"" while I'm out here on my adventure.  And even still, i cant even be accepted, cause I'm too ""white washed"" cause i don't speak the language, i think differently than them, dress different, etc...i just soon to realize...fuck fitting in with them. its too much trouble to be accepted by them.  i would want to be accepted by anybody who would respect and treat me the same way i did as them, regardless of race or color. even now, i probably get along the most with Hispanics.  they are more accepting that my own kind of race.  so in the end, be loved by other who WANT to accept you, and stop trying so hard to be accepted by others.  its a waste of your time, and a whole lot less of trouble trying...Hope this helps OP.

confessions,38bken,terapinrex,4,Wed Jun 3 06:32:50 2015 UTC,"I'm coming from a very similar situation... Half-Asian, in high school didn't really have Asian friends and didn't really think too much about my race in relations to others. I definitely agree that Asians are usually the first to aggressively say ""you're not one of us"" and it sucks but it's kind of true. I've learned to accept that I'm not fully Asian or fully white but that doesn't mean I'm nobody, and some people can't accept that for some reason. They don't understand not being anchored in one race, and Asians also tend to be the most likely to form cliques. If you want to interact with more Asians, I'd recommend getting a small leadership role (if you can) in some org you're interested in, that way you can get into the ""inner circle."""

Rather than focus on trying to connect with Asians, just make friends with everyone including Asians.   Yes, there's a bit of a cultural difference, but we still have enough common to be friends. Drinking helps. Being in the same classes helps. Find things in common.   Don't get mad if they say you're a fake Asian or similar. Is it really that much an insult? Or are you subconsciously embarrassed because it's hitting a sensitive spot? It's really not a big deal if you're ""not Asian enough."" You are who you are. I bet those Asian kids wouldn't feel too comfortable in a room full of Americans. At least you're putting yourself out there.   I also wouldn't be embarrassed to ask your one Asian friend.

When driving  I contemplated crossing into oncoming traffic on the hwy or smiled when thinking about the sharp jerk to the right with my wheel to meet the side of the cliff. I wrote many different suicide notes and at first kept them hidden in my binder. Eventually covered my walls with them. I was in a dark place. I woke up in the ambulance. My exbf called 911 and I was rescued. Now, several years later, I have 3 children I adore, a home I can call my own, and my sanity. I was the epitome of hopeless then. And now, looking back, I know I have a purpose.   Just.dont.do.it.  You're going to cheat yourself out of some truly amazing things."

A cliche phrase that gives me pause whenever I used to think about suicide was, ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.""  Your life may suck right now, you may be dreading each day but they are your days.  There are always ways for things to improve.  Finding friends saved me.  I had only known selfish, self involved people and when I made my first real friend it was mind blowing.    I'm so thankful that I never followed through with anything because I am so happy with my life now.  In a matter of months my life radically changed and I became happy.  Three years later and I am still happy even though the friends I made have moved to other countries and across the US.  Counseling (finding a GOOD therapist is SO worth it) and meeting new people  can give you meaning.  I'm just a stranger on the internet but your life is worth more than ending that way.

If you try something different and you're no better off, that option is still there. But honestly, its less about whether things immediately get better or not (they probably won't). Its about the sense of control. You make a drastic decision and suddenly you've taken positive action to manage your life. That's a seriously empowering feeling and it helps more than whether or not your situation is actually better. And in time, your situation does get better. Seriously.

Last summer, I had my first girlfriend since I was 22. Which is ridiculous, because I'm not Tommy Bahama, but I ain't ugly. I'm fit, too. But still, no companionship. At all.

I enrolled in kung fu classes. I did open mics. I played video games. I wrote poetry and short stories. I began practicing meditation (my single most worthwhile endeavor, dude.).   After a while, I got used to just being alone. Sometimes you go to a really, really dark place. You know what you do? Go to a coffee shop. Talk to people. Impose yourself on them. Make your loneliness their problem by being nice and eager to make conversation.   I know it sounds like some bullshit, but I found that by smiling often, remaining hygienic, and being eager to help others with work (gotta move furniture? check. need a dog-sitter? check.) I've endeared myself to people. It took work, and I had to realize that nobody gives a shit about cha.   If you want to catch a fish, you need bait, dude. That's just how it is. It's dog eat dog as a motherfucker. So lift those weights, get large, study hard, make that motherfucking paper, playa.   YOU CAN FUCKING DO IT!   edit: Another thing worth mentioning. Most relationships are formed through proximity. You will bond with people you are close to. You want women? Do your research. Find their watering hole, wear a button up collared shirt and some decent slacks, shave, wash your ass, brush your teeth, and have at least 100 dollars to waste. Living at home and with a steady paycheck, you should be able to pull that off at least once a month.   Have a car handy. Don't got one? RENT ONE. Get yourself a vehicle. DO NOT DRIVE DRUNK.  When you talk to those women, don't be passive. Don't needy. Don't be a white knight.   People generally do what you expect them to do. If you do your part, have fun things to talk about, do a HELL of a lot more listening than talking (women looooooooove to talk, dude.), you will find a special lady in no time.  Find their watering hole, dig in, wait, and pounce!  edit2: Lotta girls at church, bro. I mean, personally, I think it's all bullshit, but there you go.

I am actually not morally against suicide (I've stupidly attempted it in the past), but I really think in your case you can work hard and make your life amazing and enviable. You may think your problems are impossible to solve, but they probably aren't. Millions of people have gone through similar life situations.   Let me put it this way: have you really tried everything before coming to this point of no return? A lot of it really has to do with environment you are in, both in terms of immediate environment (the influences around you and media you consume) and the macro environment (state and country). Hell, if need be you deserve to try something drastic before thinking about suicide. Quit your job and go live in the forest. Have an adventure. Move to a new city. Do drugs. Do anything to get yourself out of the depression, even if it is something crazy and destructive (as long as it doesn't hurt others). Killing yourself is not the answer, but clearly neither is having things stay the same. Good things don't just fall out of the sky.  If you make a list of everything you could possibly think of doing, complete them,and still think there is no hope then this path may be the answer for you."

Was it a conscious decision or a compulsion? Was it cowardly? Was it idiotic?  You really just have no clue how horrible the situation in their mind is that they are compelled to jump out that window to their own death. I don't know how else to describe it. They're not sad in the way that you know it. And don't say I've thought about it too but would never do it because I'm brave and selfless because, if you wouldn't do it, then you're likely just not feeling anything like those people are feeling.

On top of that, my sister was openly resentful of my existance and would take out her problems on me, calling me stupid/worthless/ugly, etc. I ended up believing her because I thought family would never hurt me.  Then I ended up thinking if non-family will treat me worse than family and family treats me this why why live at all? I wasn't even a happy child, I thought maybe that meant it wasn't possible for me and I'd just end up struggling to stay alive just to suffer.

I thought if they had a different daughter it'd fix everything. Took me till 17 to break out of this sort of thinking.  I'm still working on it."
confessions,37spit,FearTheFish265,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:51:36 2015 UTC,"People commit suicide for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes it's due to inability to cope with problems. Other times it's because of medical conditions. I know of two such cases this year, both due to empty nose syndrome. It is a rare poorly understood complication of turbinate reductions. These people feel like they're perpetually drowning. Every. Single. Breath. Every. Day. Of. Their. Miserable. Lives. They tell me it's worse than death. They can't sleep. There's no distraction. They can't function. There's no treatment or cure or realistic hope for a long time. They usually hold out for as long as they can and then one day they just can't take it anymore. Their friends and fellow sufferers miss them but no one ever blames them. There are many people like this with different disorders to varying degrees. Death is mercy for them and calling them cowards is ignorant. They are brave souls and WE are lucky for every minute they give us. Not the other way around!"
confessions,37spit,nmb64,-2,Fri Jun 5 20:37:46 2015 UTC,I know the feel. Suicide is letting your problems win.
confessions,37spit,chefbender1123,0,Sat May 30 13:53:12 2015 UTC,"Some cases of suicide do emanate from serious psychiatric conditions such as depression and bipolar disorder, so not all people who do are cowards, some do really have zero control over their minds let alone the reality they live in.   Other than that, this may come across as a little bit harsh but I do think that those who cannot face whatever problems they have in life are such a bunch of pussies wasting their time and energy nagging complaining and victimizing themselves instead of actually thinking of solutions to the problems or they would have had different expectations of their or even lack the pruprose or motivation and goals and when things get hard they dont seem to want to get anything out of it ... There many solutions to your problems and suicide is not one.  PS I have suffered depression and OCD and had no support from anyone in my family or friends , lived in a country that oppressed me for my gender, went broke tryna pay for college, had my father walk out on us when I was at a very young age and here i am studying in the university of my dreams , living the life I have always wanted and following my goals"

There are two roads you can go down in your life. You can either fuck everyone you are attracted to, and to hell with the consequences. This is a valid choice, you are looking out for yourself and your own pleasure first.   Or, you can take the feelings of others, like this girl, who you claim to care about, into account before you do stuff. There have been PLENTY of situations where I wanted to fuck someone, but didn't, because I knew if we were found out, it would really hurt someone I love emotionally. (And typically, in my experience of living life, it's usually found out at some point or another).  You can do whatever you want. Just be aware that if you continue with it, it's entirely possible you'll have to look your friend in the eyes some day with both of you having full knowledge of you screwing her dad.

I talked with her mom too they were just the cool parents among our friends that you could talk to about whatever. . But one time we were talking and then I asked him about my feelings toward him, something along the lines of asking how come I went from simple crushing to sexually thinking about him, we talked and talked and during that conversation he made a comment about my butt that changed my whole life lol then from there we would exchange smiles when no one was looking and things like that. It turned into us sneaking off in various parts in the house where I would show off my ass for him posing and stuff, weeks later I showed him my bare ass. Then my breasts then my pussy. One time he asked to touch and it was a wrap. The sneaking extended outside their house and he started fingering me then oral sex for like a year and we finally had sex right after I graduated Hs , it was like a natural progression, that gradually snuck up on me."

confessions,37ff44,thundercock74,2,Wed May 27 05:57:54 2015 UTC,"Firstly, don't sweat the loans. From your post I'm assuming you're a fellow Brit, for us we dont repay until we start earning ~21,000 so some good news there. What do you want to do for a job? Once you figure that out, forget your degree, first thing you need is experience...literally any experience, to get that CV started. I know the desire to launch straight at the top jobs is strong but that is not going to happen unless you are really lucky and even then you run the risk of being out of your depth. Take a job at the lowest rung of the job you want. Learn it well, listen to those above you, and progress up the ladder, try to work in every area of the job you desire. The experience and respect this will earn you later, when having to supervise others, is invaluable. Say for example you want to run your own hotel eventually. Start by tending bar, give it a while then work as a chamber-person, work your way through all the jobs, (~6 months in each should suffice.) then go for assistant manager, here you need to look for someone to become a mentor, someone you respect and who can teach you all their skills. This is a rough guide, adopt it to fit your circumstances and realize that you are an adult now. Sit the parents down and have an adult chat. Thank them for their time, money and patience with you, treat them with respect but make your point that you have achieved much and when you know what your going to do, let them know. I know it looks like they are getting at you but trust me, as a father of two, it is born of love and exacerbated by their fears for your future. Show them the man you are. Good luck, I hope it goes well."

confessions,37ff44,TeaDrinkingRedditor,1 point,Wed May 27 15:14:36 2015 UTC,"Well, first you should be sending out resumes like it's the only think keeping the Earth spinning.  I don't know how much these sites are geared for Britain, but you might try checking out indeed.com or careerbuilder.com.  They're good sites in the US.  Also, if you google 'business jobs in [wherever you're looking] some dedicated job search sites should come up.  I'm going through this process right now, so I know how frustrating it is.  Even if a place says they want 1-2 years experience, give them a resume anyways.  Most of those places probably won't call you back, but there will probably be a few who do.  If you're looking in an area that isn't well populated, you may need to shift your search for a more populated area.  Even if you don't want to live there, you can take a job for a year or two, get experience, and then be more selective once you've got a couple years under your belt.  You might also try submitting your resume to a recruiting company (they can usually be found on job search sites - and will probably have a bunch of different jobs posted in the area you're looking for).  Something may come out of it, or nothing may.  But it's another potential avenue to explore.  Best of luck to you, and keep sending out those resumes"

The best way to find a job is to work out what you want to do and keep at it.  As an employer, when I write an ad the requirements in a job ad they are usually a wish-list and we're lucky if we can get someone who actually has those qualification to take the job.  Find a position that you actually want to do and after enough interviews someone will take you on, even if it's only because they're desperate to have the position filled.

confessions,37ejio,mittermayr,3,Sun May 31 03:50:32 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, there's one thing you can't disagree with: anything you do now, has absolutely no potential to harm you. Starting at the bottom means you can just go do about anything you're curious of. Of course, sounds esoteric, but really, if you've got nothing to loose, what's the harm of trying unusual things? Most people never find themselves in such a unique position—and I know it sounds off—but that's a pretty rare moment to bank on my friend. I don't mean literally rob a bank. More like, trying out things that others find scary, terrifying, embarrassing or humiliating. Buy a tent, hike for a week and go fishing. You will come back, and I promise this, as a different person (post back here). Get a really weird job or volunteer for one (I once ended up backstage at a rock concert after stewarding). Look at that unshaped character of yours and shape it into whatever you want. Others will flock to shaped characters to absorb and be inspired, never worry about friends once you've got a story to tell. Before you kick it all away, go on a trip popular with young people, a trail, something. Pick something that's big and bold, if even that's the last thing you attempt. Then finish it and come back with a story to tell. By the time you have a story, you'll also have those who enjoy listening to it. Go to New York or London, get an internship and be a completely different person for 3 months. Fly to Asia and work as an English teacher for half a year, or go on streetlife.com or similar neighborhood sites in a different city and offer your time or services to someone who needs it. One day is all.   Your mom will never get over it, so will all those other people you think aren't aware of you. However shit their life was, it will be a million times more shit for eternity.  You've been through a lot, but that's your story. Many grow up all right, live all right, and die all right — and nothing happened to shape them. They never had an issue with anything. You did, it built your character, it gave you a foundation to go and use for whatever the fuck you want to do other than throwing it away.  Report back."

If you just hang with friends, they probably don't see you romantically, and if you don't meet anyone new, you're never going to meet someone who loves you.  Are you quiet? This is my biggest issue. I'm a pretty quiet guy. I don't like most conversation, and I definitely come off as unapproachable and boring.  Are you unattractive? I'm serious. I know I probably sound like an asshole, but if you're at a party, all the guys there are going to want to chat up the hot girls in the room, if you can't compete, you have to work that much harder to meet someone.  Lastly, are you boring? Some people like boring people, so they can hang around, cuddle and watch movies all day. These people aren't the ones you're going to meet going out on the town and partying with your friends. These are the people you meet in online games, most of which you will never see the faces of.

Everyone wants someone they are attracted to, and someone who will complement their current lifestyle and enrich their lives. They want someone with whom they can share their current lives with while joining you in your life."

You say you have never had anyone have a crush on you but it would be a freak outlier if that were the case. There has most likely been a few guys or girls who have had a crush on you but chickened out and didnt say anything. I think maybe youre putting too much pressure on yourself here. You say you just smile and put on a brave face but people are more perceptive than you think. You need to be happy with yourself and your life before you go jumping into a relationship.

I'm 42, a little older than you, and more than half of my peers are also not religious.  Yet, in your post you referred to ""God"" and you referred to being ""created.""

But she insists she doesn't hate men/boys and has always been celibate because she's ugly.  Like a female Elliot Rodger, only instead of killing 6 people instantaneously, she chose to kill one (me) slowly by abusing me so severely and persistently from such an early age that she ruined the entirety of my life - I'd rather she had strangled me fatally as an infant.  Meanwhile I've seen men try to talk to her and seen her react by just about ripping their heads off.  My advice is to look within and find out why you don't want anything to do with men - and to do so before you ruin a male child's life, whether your own, a nephew, a student, whatever.  You can do this through therapy, religion, meditation or the use of psychedelic drugs, many of which are legal (salvia, woodrose seeds, etc.)"

I can say neither mean squat. But ,. on the bright side. ""their's someone for everyone"" seems to be a fact if you are open to socializing a bit.  Find something you enjoy, find others who share a common activity, and make yourself aware of oppertunities to bond with others who may want a new pal. It gets easier with frequency, and you can learn alot from others. It is often uncomfortable, awkward,. and no matter what anyone says, you will make compromises/ concessons, to allow for ""urgency or time-constraints"".    Unless you are never anywhere to be seen by others, or just not pleasant to deal with in idle conversation, (i have a collegue (f) who is super attractive , but just a bear to engage in any sort of casual encounter). These people are passed over and ignored the same or worse than if they just had nothing to say at all.  You need to engage and entice your way into a circle of friends/partner ,. you don't start right off in a mental wrestling match in toxic subject matter and full blown snark. Those comfort ""cruise"" settings of ease come later in interactions with those who you are able to group with to a common end. Relaxing at park, having a brew at pub, finding a sport, cause, vocation, any number of daily activities will give oppertunity to be a friend.     And just my opinion,. but there are two kinds of relationships I care about and I preffer to start as friends first. But we don't have to stay friends. Look out for yourself first . You have to earn trust and display loyalty. Anything ELSE should be discussed and understood as upfront as possible. No-one likes surprises.  Sorry if this is not helpful. It just spoke to me . Lots of people go longer than anyone should have to without feeling a satisfying soul love or physical intimacy. This is a sad fact and technology can be your friend that helps, or the ""couch-potato"" block that keeps you from doing the one other thing that may cause your whole life to change.

Well, young friend, I'm glad you feel better after getting that off your chest.  You'll find as you get older that every body has deep dark secrets like this.  Don't judge yourself, having a fetish is perfectly normal, as long as it doesn't bleed over and cause you problems with the rest of your life. The important thing is to always maintain moderation and balance.  Also if and when you ever get a girlfriend, make sure she is into this stuff too.  It would probably help if she is Japanese since hentai is Japanese cultural phenomenon and is not as taboo to someone from that culture as it is to......well.....the entire rest of the world.  I sincerely hope this helps."

In Japan people who have an overwhelming interest in any part of their culture(normally anime or hentai) they are known as Otakus which is frowned upon.

confessions,3761m9,Colonel26,0,Mon May 25 05:23:13 2015 UTC,"What I think is that you will have to find what works best for you.  For comparison, I drink alcohol in moderation (2 to 3 drinks) on Saturday nights when we go out on the town for a social evening.  I typically don't drink the entire rest of the week unless there is a special occasion.   Luckily I don't have an addictive personality, so I'm able to throttle my alcohol consumption to a reasonable amount that doesn't cause me any problems with my health or relationships to/with other people.   If however, I did have a problem with it, I would probably cut it out altogether to avoid that slippery slope into becoming an alcoholic. You are at the same crossroads.........if you can be honest with yourself and say 'hey, I enjoy this, and I'm going to keep it reasonable and look at hentai no more than 2 hours per week, on the same night every week'.....then that is reasonable.   If you can't set a hard limit like that and it consumes your every waking moment, then it's probably best to cut it out."

Remind yourself that 'this too shall pass' if you find yourself finding the waiting really difficult to stand... because when you look back, the time will have been shorter than it felt at the time.

As much as everyone likes to talk about older people being more exclusionary, etc, I've found it to be the opposite as I've gotten older. When you're young, you can easily choose who you associate with, which makes forming cliques of like-minded people very easy.  As people enter the workforce, they are forced to interact with people from all walks of life, which tends to calm down some of the all-or-nothing rhetoric.  College used to fill this role, but university culture seems to have become less and less tolerant of differing views in the last few decades (even more so in the 2000's)."

confessions,36wz1a,NorCalTico,4,Fri May 22 22:18:56 2015 UTC,"Mostly my grandpa. He grew up in the civil rights movement and he tells me stories of what he experienced. Being the skeptic that I am, I have  tried the liberal side too and had my ""wild"" period of doing non-Christian things. As I got older, (I'm 30) I realized how right my grandpa and daddy was about the world, God, and Democrats. I changed. I believe that conservatives (not all, of course) believe in equality. They see everyone the same and recognize people for who they are and not what family they were born to. They take the constitution for what it is and not what it could be interpreted into. They are mostly pro-life and let everyone do their own thing...again, for the most part. You got guys like Mike Huckaby who want to turn every person into a Christian, it seems. Rand Paul is my guy."

Some people are Republican for social issues, but not for economic issues. For example: You are against gay marriage, abortion, sex education in schools, and evolution-only classrooms but you support welfare support for the poor and unemployed, funding for public schools, and national healthcare.  Is it like that for you?"
confessions,36wz1a,smokebreak,2,Sat May 23 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"That's why I specifically said conservative and not Republican. There are stupid Republicans like Boehner, McCain, Chirstie, ect. I could care less if gays get married but I still recognize it as sin, I am very pro-life, sex-ed is very important in school, and evolution being taught in schools is fine. I definitely support welfare for the poor and unemployed, funding for schools and national healthcare if all of those are done correctly.  So in essence, it's almost like that for me."
confessions,36wz1a,asdfman2000,0,Sat May 23 18:46:45 2015 UTC,"You are not against gay marriage, you're not against sex-ed, you're not against evolution-ed, you're not against welfare, you're not against public schools, and you're not against national healthcare.

If it's taught in schools who cares. We learn about the Greek and Roman Gods and nobody worships them anymore. National healthcare should not be forced on the people and they should be able to go with or without insurance at AFFORDABLE rates. I'm definitely conservative."
confessions,36wz1a,smokebreak,-1,Sat May 23 22:59:54 2015 UTC,"Well, ok. I think that you might consider telling the other 100 million Conservatives that they can't use that word anymore, because you're using it for your own political beliefs.  Teaching kids how to pass standardized tests comes from Conservatives/Republicans trying to prove that public school teachers are failing so that they can pull funding out of public schools. Teaching creationism in school and attacking evolution comes from your fellow Christians who believe the bible's creation story.   So, in the end, I'm not surprised that a young black woman is conservative, that's actually very common. I'm more surprised that someone with level-headed views who is willing to compromise would call herself conservative.  By the way, I am not a Democrat or a Liberal."

We focus more on the positive, gloss over the negative all the while beat ourselves up over what we did wrong. They become “the one that got away” because we feel deep regret and wish to change the past to make them happy. To make us happy.    Sounds like you have recognized the problem. Focus on changing to be a better man next time. If you’re in a relationship now, or maybe you’re single, the real issue may be that you’re unhappy, frustrated you haven’t found deep love since. You’re looking for that comfort, love and passion you’ve built up thinking about your ex. If you’re comparing girls to your ex, stop! They will never be her. It’s not fair to you and it’s not fair to them and you will struggle to move on.  It takes time -- sometimes more, sometimes less – but once you’re able to really let go of the guilt, take action to be a better man -- you will find happiness.

If you were thinking clearly and in a mentally balanced state, this would be obvious to you.   It's totally beside the point what kind of person your ex's new boyfriend is, the fact is you shouldn't have any opinion on it at all... it's none of your business. She's your ex. If she wanted you she'd be with you... she doesn't want you, and it's not your place to follow her around and try to find ways to mess up her life in hopes that you can swoop in and save her. That's not only delusional, its grossly selfish. You don't care about her at all, just so long as you think you might get another chance. This is all about you, and that's horrible. I'm sure you think this is best for both of you, and that you're doing this out of love for her. Frankly, that's totally delusional bullshit and not how love works.   There's no way to know if he would have cheated on her or not, but now that you've interfered, instead of this being about what a shitty person HE is and made it about how unbalanced and obsessed YOU are.   You said you had/have a therapist. I think you desperately need to talk to them and tell them what you've been doing. This is very serious abnormal behaviour, and the fact you don't seem to understand that shows just how badly you need help. I'm sorry your in such pain, and it sucks you're having such a hard time dealing with this, but that's not an excuse to hurt other people or to behave in such a completely inappropriate way.

Some tips:  1) Find a friend who you can talk to  2) Get back in contact with your ex (though no with any romantic intent).  She likely knows you better than you do and she saw the good in you way back when.  3) How old are you?  If you're younger, get rid of any ID with your age on it and clean your house of alcohol.  This will slow down any attempts to get booze and give you time to think it over (and hopefully come to the right decision).  4) Tell your friends about your withdrawal and inform them you will not attend any parties ect. with alcohol.  This will prevent them from tempting you."

Your default is to stay home and remain within your lonely walls. It won't feel great to start doing things and leaving the comfort of those walls, but to change, you have to change. I agree with Darkthoughts, a part time job is a fantastic idea. One where there is a lot of other people your age to start interacting with others.  Also, a bit of a reality check might help you. Stop giving yourself permission to disengage with the world and get involved.  procrastination can take many forms, and everyone can justify anything. Could not agree more about dark thought's grandfather said. something to do, someone to love, something to believe in. love it!! good luck getting busy :)"

So man, this whole ""I'm not going to ever get laid"" thing is FAR too early to start going. Man, just between you and me, I didn't get laid in my teens either. Many people don't.  It gets so much better when you are out of high school. Get your diploma and move on to college and you'll find that life is so much better now that you are removed from all of the people that dragged you down before (including Neil). Starting fresh really helps... plus you are surrounded by people who are thinking similar things to what you are thinking.  All that said, it would be wrong for me to say that life isn't going to be a little hard for you. Many gay friends I know struggle to find someone cool to date. Turns out there aren't a lot of people in the gay pool so you have to really cast your line out there to get something good. I've known a bunch of gay people who had to spend years trying to find someone else. It's tough. But the dudes I know who've found soul mates are in some of the best relationships of anyone I know. It takes a lot of time and effort but if you are not a total douche and don't live on an island you'll probably find the promised land.  But here's the thing: when you are young, try your best to be obsessed with something other than relationships. I know, it's hard not to be. But life is more than just this constant need to build a family unit. There's so much more out there to do. Find something you love to do that you can do well enough to get paid decently for. Find something that inspires you to give back to the people who have made you great or find ways to make the next generation not go through the problems you went through. All the gay or straight people I know who are in relationships, they weren't obsessed with getting into a relationship. It happened naturally. And in the meantime they built themselves into super-awesome people. Surely you will can do the same, because it sounds like you are a compassionate, thoughtful person."

Since you are almost 18 I strongly, STRONGLY suggest you break away from the family unit. Not emotionally, but physically. Surely there is one person on this planet that will take just you in. The sheer number of your family makes it more difficult to function in this dire situation. Call around, go live with cousin Bob or whoever, get a job even if it is mowing lawns. Walk to work if you have to. You will make it easier on your own for a bit and it will make the load lighter for your family. I know this sounds harsh but I think it would work.

In my experience, there are very few ways for it to work out where you remain friends, and both kind of remain up to him. You can either 1) not talk about it and hope that he drops it and it all goes back to normal. Some people can just move on and not approach it again. 2) Be direct and talk about it. This takes a lot of maturity and comfort on both sides. And even if you can bring yourself to do it, you have already made up your mind.

If you have time at home looking after the kids, you can study things while they play video games or watch tv. You can finish college part-time, even taking all online classes (look up a good non-profit state university like UMass, avoid for-profits like university of phoenix like the plague). I am finishing a degree that way myself and most of my peers are people who work full time and have kids. It will take a while, but if you chip away it consistently and do summer classes, it will be over before you know it. It has to end eventually.  Or you don't even have to do college. Just study some actual skills.. like programming, IT, bookkeeping. Or look into some trade skills like plumbing and electrician and see if you can get an apprenticeship to replace your current job.  There are plenty of decent paying jobs out there that don't require a college degree. but they do require proficiency at some skill and hard work to get into it.  But you are only 25, you can do it. I am turning 28 and although I don't have kids, i wasted a lot of time getting two other useless college degrees in a field I hate and I still live with my parents as a result. We both have 35+ years of a career ahead of us, literally longer than we've both been alive... so why throw in the towel so early?  Start small. Try maybe one community college class online.

I was just confessing to my own mental faults when it comes to approaching women. That is my own problem. and your response is giving me a headache.  My mistrust of women comes from my lack of confidence and self worth. My mistrust comes from my brain making me think that, deep down, no matter what the situation presents itself as, no woman would want me because I'll never be good enough. I fully accept that this is because of my own self perspective. Not other people's.   YOUR mistrust is expressing itself as woman hating, and sounds like you are so self conscious that you want to blame women for all your short comings... so your dick is ""smaller than a baseball bat,"" big deal. porn isnt real life."

With all the friends I've lost and relationships that have crumbled I have blamed myself for everything. It isn't fair. It isn't right, but it's what I have grown accustomed to.

confessions,35s8oi,fromwhencewecame,1 point,Sun May 17 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"in my personal experience, the frequency with which you think about your past has a direct correlation to whether or not you are developing a future self. Often times, it's easy to lose sight of the value of yourself as a single unit, when you are in a long term relationship. When those relationships end, we feel particularly lonely, and tend to obsess over our memories because it allows us to glean some sense of the good way we felt when we were with our ex. The most positive thing you can do is to cultivate your own self worth. One of life's hard truths is that the world is not always going to open up to you. Pursue short and long term goals, and allow yourself to become wrapped up in the process of accomplishing those goals. In developing your own self worth, you will build a stronger desire to look forward, instead of back"

Also explain that it was a moment of weakness and she completely caught you off guard and you have absolutely no feelings for anyone but your wife....
confessions,351wvq,RaesofLoveyLoath,1 point,Thu May 7 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"Don't tell her. Take this to your grave. If you really mean what you said about not being attracted to her and not having sex, it sounds like you want to relieve your guilt by telling her. Being pregnant makes you emotional and if you tell her this you might as well have slept with her. Seriously, it would break her heart and she would never see you the same again. She wouldn't be able to trust you even though you know you had no feelings for this person. But if you aren't attracted to this women i dont wanna know what you would do with a woman you ARE attracted to!  Suck it deep down until you forget about it. Suck it down down down because you'd be doing more damage than not to her. You HAVE to make sure she WONT find out! And that doesn't mean telling your friends ex wife not to say anything. As soon as you say that to a woman she will tell everyone. You need to cover your fucking tracks good. If your lying and you wanted and meant to cheat, leave her and save her the fuckin trouble.   Just saying, that was so stupid of you to do. Like retarded. Your girl is pregnant with your baby. When you meet your child you're gonna feel like a jackass. But still gotta keep your mouth shut. Dont you ever let her find out. And if for some reason she does, you're going to deny deny deny because she wont believe it meant nothing if you didn't tell her.   I would say to tell her she kissed you and you pulled the fuck away, but your situation is too particular and fragile. Keep your mouth shut.  Maybe someday when you're married 15 years on an anniversary drinking wine when you guys decide to reveal secrets, maybe then you can tell her. (yes she has secrets too. Probably not kissing ones though.)   And don't get all weird on her asking if she is with other dudes or question her loyalty. That is a dead giveaway. Tread lighty. You really fucked up and consequences may be more than you're prepared to deal with."

If you do that with someone you're not attracted to and cant fight INSTINCT, what the fuck would you do with someone you ARE attracted to?  Like, okay, so if a man comes up and kisses you and you're not attracted to him, are you gonna kiss back because you can't fight your instinctual lips? Give me a fucking break. You kissed back because you wanted to try it. Then found out, nope don't like her that way.  One day you're gonna hate the woman you're with for one night because of a fight and you're gonna fuck some girl and then get real stupid and think you're in love. You are a dirty dog in the making.   throughout this whole post you are so concerned about yourself and YOUR guilt. You feel sorry because YOU just found out you actually really love your woman because YOU fucked up. What about her? Shes sacrificing her body and LIFE for you and your child, AND she is not instinctively kissing other dudes. You know why you think you despise cheaters? Because deep down you ARE one. Sounds like you might not want to be a father yet. Suck it up man. Catch yourself before you fuck your life up.   God, this poor girl is in for a world of hurt. My heart goes out to her."

If you were my father, I'd be furious... its terribly irresponsible to me for someone to pay into a policy for 19 years and then throw it away on pride.    Its good that you don't wish to lie... but I think a better way of putting this right is to quit the ugly habit that you still have, and make it true that you do not use tobacco, rather than take the easy way out and cancel the policy that makes you feel guilty in the first place.

I feel that what will likely happen is that the smoking even though I lied about it, will be overlooked since it was short lived, not caught in the two year period where they can get you and I haven't done it in probably more than 15 years.  I actually discussed the smokeless tobacco with my agent a few years ago and he said it was fine because it wasn't mentioned on application...but I have since found where it was mentioned and I need to make sure I am still covered after I bring attention to it or see if until I quit I can get a tobacco users rate.  Yes I am wanting to do what is morally right I also factor in that I don't want my family to not collect the money in the event of my death...which could happen if nicotine is found in my system while I have been paying on a non tobacco users policy.  While it may have seemed selfish, it is certainly not meant to be that way.

Look into something called 'Colon Hydrotherapy' if you really feel the need to have this done.  They do it with an Isotonic solution (saltwater), so that it doesn't cause an electrolyte imbalance.  Also, you do NOT want to do this everyday as your bowels will become dependent on it to function and the normal peristalsis of your colon will not continue to function without help."

confessions,34j6gy,CupcakeUnicorn,5,Fri May 1 22:38:03 2015 UTC,"Not a scientist/medical professional/etc., but the answer is osmosis. Your body has a certain electrolyte level that it needs to maintain to be healthy. When add water in a place it usually is not (i.e colon), some of the electrolytes in your body move to the water, which you then flush out. Thus you are left with depleted electrolyte levels. Which is not good.  I believe store bought enemas have some sort of saline solution. The doctor elsewhere in this thread advised you to have this done by a professional, but if you plan to ignore that advice - a true enema solution is preferable to tap water."

You're right, she was the only thing that sucked about the second movie, which was otherwise good, and my memory decided to group her in with the third movie.   The third movie is quite terrible though, has a plot about as thick as wet toilet paper with whole 'taking over wall street' and Batman flying the nuke out over the bay to detonate, and yet still not suffering the consequences of it (radiation, tsunami tidal wave, etc.)"

It turned out my body was producing way too much Prolactin(which does nothing good for guys, btw) and that it was binding to the same receptors that Serotonin was supposed to bind to. my levels were 500 times higher than they were supposed to be. 3 months into treatment I actually feel like I am settling into a good normal. not super happy, not super sad... contented mental state.

A lot of being a domme is role playing and more than one of the pro dommes I've met are natural subs who say they get pleasure out of playing a role that makes another person happy.

confessions,33jsyl,hysterian,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:11:09 2015 UTC,In what way is the planet not overpopulated?
confessions,33jsyl,AuthorTomFrost,0,Fri Apr 24 03:28:17 2015 UTC,"Well, mathematicians/statisticians have run the numbers. They've shown why the Human population grew very slowly for the first 200,000 years of our existence, and why it exploded in the last ~200 years or so. (It had to do with an average of 2-3 children per couple surviving to sexual maturity. Two children replace their parents, but the population doesn't grow much.)  They then showed why technology and social advancements led to higher survivability of children to sexual maturity, along with extended lifespans, and a population explosion resulted. However, nations that have fully developed (the 1st world) later reverted to a two child average by choice late in their development as nations. (The populations of Japan and some EU nations are actually decreasing)  Recently, since the end of the colonial period, the rest of the world developed quickly and now they have also reverted to a two child average, with few exceptions. Meaning, the rate of increase in our population will slow down, and we'll reach a relative flat line of about 12 billion. (The next 5 billion will mostly be due to increases in lifespans, mostly in the 3rd world)  So, we'll hit 12 billion with the 2-child average that kept our population stable for thousands of years. We have plenty of resources to sustain 12 billion (and many more), but we have to make some societal changes.   For example: we need to stop using fossil fuels, we need to switch to modern farming techniques such as vertical hydroponic farms, and we must build high density, sustainable residential zones similar to Songdo City in South Korea.  So, the number of people isn't a problem now, and it never will be. Our problem is, and will be, mismanagement of resources and waste.  Here is a link to a great VIDEO that explains it very well and is easy to understand."

I've found that caring less really helps with this. I don't mean about the person, but about whether you are annoying or not. Just send the message, fuck it, if they don't want to reply that's their decision. How will one text annoy them anyways? Just go for it and move on, if they reply, sweet, you got yourself a conversation, if not, find something fun to do.   Another thing is to focus on all the good fun times/conversations you've had with whatever person is in question, focus on that, they do like your company, you're just jading your view of the situation with a negative outlook that isn't an issue (it can be hard to break that).  If I notice myself starting to think like that, I make a point of drinking more water, getting more hydrated, give yourself a lie in if you can or an early night if not.

Now this isn't to say that I don't still have crippling ""over-politeness"" but I can generally be more outgoing and forthright. Still can't text first or hold a texting conversation though.

Something that I was worried I might've had myself. Have you talked to a doctor about this? This seems really important, because Meniere's is a shitty ass illness. Not to freak you out, but it's a hard illness to diagnose, so it's worth it to know it exists.   My thoughts on your schooling are that you are still very young, and if the worst thing happens, being your failing, you will almost certainly recover from it. But certainly fight for your education, get all sorts of doctor's notes if you have to. Sometimes life gets in the way, but sometimes you just have to push life out the damn way. Bust in the door. Wave middle fingers around to everybody. Well, maybe not that.   Or better yet, start asking to speak to supervisors. That's what I would do if I couldn't get an answer from one person. But that's me. Can you speak to a counsellor at the school to help you figure out a way to navigate this? Or someone else who can advocate for you?  You'll figure it out.

You could even be physically attracted to one sex and emotionally attracted to both, or vice-versa.  The point is, sexuality is often complicated, and you're not alone.  I highly recommend you look it up.  It will probably help you make some sense of your sexuality."

confessions,33c82s,BigNaturalTilts,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:26:48 2015 UTC,It should be acceptance. Why can girls have girl-on-girl sex without anyone questioning their sexuallity? But when a guy have guy sex then he's suddenly gay. I don't get it.
confessions,33c82s,mclaclan,2,Tue Apr 21 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"Because that's sexuality. I can pay a prostitute to have sex with my wife or girlfriend and she would do it and pretend to enjoy it but she wouldn't be gay. She'd just be a prostitute making a buck. The act of sex itself is removed from her sexuality.  So many possible variations. Essentially, if you enjoy the sexual company of the same sex you are a homosexual. If you enjoy both you are bisexual. And if you enjoy the opposite, you are heterosexual.  I really don't see how this is complicated. If OP has been with girls and enjoyed himself he's bisexual. If not, he is gay."

You don't want to live with these regrets. Truth is you don't know him anything and if he is as awesome as you say he is he will understand.  also you said, you want to live with passion just not with your boyfriend. Please tell him how your feeling. That's so sad. I would want to know if my girlfriend felt that way."

But do be honest with him about what you want to explore while gone. That's only right. Maybe he'll accept a ""break"" from the relationship for a time. Maybe one or both of you will find something even better than what you've got now. You never know. You don't belong to him, not legally, not yet. You don't owe him commitment. You don't owe anyone your presence, since you're not a parent yet. If you do commit, you want to be 100% sure that you're done with your wild oats, or trust me, there will be problems."

confessions,32vsvz,AuthorTomFrost,2,Fri Apr 17 15:10:47 2015 UTC,This is so true. You're making a commitment to only one person so technically just need one or two random witnesses. I think that can be more romantic.

I think a mulligan would not be out of the question provided you come up with some way to make up that time / material and present it to him / her as a solution while making your request!
