I have two docs as well but they belong to the same practice and I am able to coordinate my visits and can see them both within the same morning.  And, occasionally they talk to each other about my case and coordinate treatment somewhat.  But, prior to that, it was extremely annoying.   I shopped around for a long time before I found a place that I liked.   My suggestion is to find a large oncology practice that can handle all your needs at one clinic.     Some of the larger clinics also offer care coordinators that can be helpful."
cancer,3e2rpf,PlanetaryPlaneJane,11,Tue Jul 21 14:48:26 2015 UTC,"Male, 29, just finished my mastectomy 2 hours ago. The doctors removed two lymph nodes instead of 1 as planned.   Excited and nervous to find out what the pathologist has to say about the cancer they pulled out. It will seal my fate regarding my need for chemo or not. Either way I'll probably need radiation and hormonal therapy.   Oh and I'm nippleless.   Feeling fortunate that I caught this sumbitch early..."

cancer,3e2rpf,cancerhelp44,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:07 2015 UTC,"I feel that way. I saw a YouTube video that explained how more than one lymph node can end up colored. I was nervous about having two removed when first told by the doctor.  Still a bit nervous though with some unanswered questions.  Will I end up needing chemo?  How bad will the side effects be of having the mastectomy surgery, mechanically.  What can happen now that I am missing 2 lymph nodes.  Will radiation or hormonal therapy cause serious negative side effects?   Will keep reading and ask the docs, just biting my nails about the chemo though."
cancer,3e2rpf,JustCallMeAtom,3,Tue Jul 21 17:30:28 2015 UTC,"I have no idea as to the answers to those questions. I know chemo does have plenty of side effects, but you are young, and if you are otherwise healthy, you will manage it fine, i'm sure (I've not experienced it myself). Be sure to research health nutrition to compliment your treatment. I beleive it's equally important. Best of luck and i hope all goes well!  A lot of people would give both nipples to have the choices you have :)"
cancer,3e2rpf,cancerhelp44,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"So relieved that you caught it early!

Not having seen your parents and how they're handling it, my first guess would be that they're worried that you've either given up on your dreams because of this or that you're hiding, letting work become you...I say that because I've seen it from my own hehe.  It would be tough to argue that you're lazy with several jobs.  That's just my first completely uneducated guess - the truth of it is that it might be completely helpful to talk to someone professionally about this. It might also be a good idea for them to talk to someone about what's going on.   As for education and jobs, there's no easy answer here. I would say that if you're nervous about your odds of completing the 4 year program in one go without getting yourself cornered, there's nothing wrong with getting a 2 year degree and upgrading it to 4 when you're able, so that you can control your progress a little better.  I'm sure you hear it all the time, but the history degree makes me nervous...I would hate for you to finally get the degree only to not be able to get the job you need with it. If you're set on history, something like teaching MIGHT be an alternative. It is extremely competitive and rather low paying depending on your state, though. I also know basically nothing about what insurance programs are available for low or no employment, but there could be something.   All I can say is keep your chin up. Talk to people, whoever your support group is, and I really do recommend talking to someone professionally (especially with insurance in hand now)."

cancer,3e27rp,DaB0mb0,2,Tue Jul 21 13:40:01 2015 UTC,"Well, while a college degree doesn't necessarily open doors for you, some employers will frown upon or exclude those without a degree. I agree with /u/Inorai - a 2 year degree might be wise.   As far as the ambition to become a pastry chef - ask yourself if you really want to be in the restaurant industry long-term. It was very stressful for me and I saw that the people who had been in it for a long time were generally not happy or living a lifestyle I'd aspire to have.  Does the school you attended have a career counseling center? My university offers free counseling for alumni for life. If not, do you have a social worker on your cancer team you can talk to about your direction? While I empathize with your aversion to long-term planning, it is important to not make a short-sighted decision that could pidgeonhole you into a future out of line with your core values. In the short term, you don't need a job to provide any insurance whatsoever. I have a plan from the health insurance marketplace that has made my crisis totally manageable."

I was ready to be depressed mid way through your post, but am so happy it worked out for you guys.  My mom is having a biopsy tomorrow morning to find out what type of cancer she has. I took her to the E.R last week for severe stomach pain, and she hadn't gone to the bathroom in several days. We figured it was the pain meds she was taking for sciatica clogging her up. Nope, ""Cancer all over the stomach"" we were told.  Goddamn if seeing your mother in pain is not the worst fucking feeling in the world.  Really glad it turned out well for you guys - she truly does sound like an amazing woman! Thanks for posting!"
cancer,3e1azc,cancersucksbigtime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:57:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna lie, seeing the woman that raised you being unable to get out of bed without help is heartbreaking. Laying in bed every night worrying about the next day. Developed really bad anxiety over it all. But i figured that she took care of me for 16 years, i can take care of her for 6 months and I told her that. and she STILL did everything she used to. But sometimes a symbol of hope is what kept her going. For her, it was a ladybug. Her grandmother died from stage 3 ovarian cancer and somehow the lady bug thing started with her. There's a genetic fuck up that causes cancer in her family. So when my moms mom (My grandma) battled cancer 3 times, she always carried a lady bug on her and she beat it all 3 times. She gave the ladybug pen she carried on her to my mom and my mom always kept something ladybug related  on her. I'm having some medical issues of my own and my mom doesn't pray to god, she prays to her grandma. I had to go to childrens hospital and the night before, my mom prayed to her grandma to send her a lady bug. In the lobby of the hospital, there were ladybug fixtures on the wall. Day before the surgery for her, ladybugs all over the garden outside her bedroom window. So maybe some sort of symbol will help your mom get through it.  More on the lady bug: ""The Ladybug is associated with spirituality and religious devotion. The name Ladybug originated in Europe during the Middle Ages, when insects (tumors) were destroying the crops (body). Catholic farmers were said to have prayed to the Virgin Mary for help. Soon after, Ladybugs appeared and began eating the pests and saved the crops from destruction. The farmers began to call the Ladybugs “the Beetles of Our Lady” and eventually they were known as Lady Beetles. The Ladybug's red wings are said to represent the Virgin's cloak and the black spots her joys and sorrows.   The Ladybug is widely considered a symbol of luck and is seen as a good omen when it comes calling. In Sweden, it is said that if one lands on a young woman's hand, she will soon get married. In France, it is said that if you are ill when one lands on you, it will fly away with your illness.   Ladybugs are also considered to be symbols of fire and the Sun.   Ladybug teaches life is short and it teaches to let go of ones' worries and fears, to trust in spirit and enjoy life. It brings the gifts of renewal and regeneration"""

Also, it asks how many family members had cancer (both of mine, colon and lung), but then later it seems specifically colon.  In all (as a fellow researcher), not specific enough.

I did with my first one and ended up pulling the catheter out of position and eventually had to have it replaced.  My doc told me to avoid lifting my elbow above my shoulder on the side with the port. He also told me not to shoot anything bigger than a .223 rifle or .410 shotgun.   Take care of your port...you don't want to have to deal with IV chemo.
cancer,3dzlbu,adenocarcinoma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:15:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, it says not to work out to much with the port in.  I could not swim with my port or lift anything heavy.  Call the manufacturer for more details."

cancer,3dzlbu,tarlack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"You can lift heavy stuff just not weight lift training with higher reps.  It is the repeated motion and the way the port is attached that is the problem.  You will get friction from the line that goes into the vain and that can sometimes be manifested as tightness in the shoulder.  I was also told you can get build up of tissue around the port from doing to much chest activity.  I found after about 5 month my port pain lessens but I still had to be careful.   I was told that even rock climbing could be a problem if I tried it.  So when I was feeling like I was able to work out I mostly focused on cardio and everything but my chest.  The one thing I did find of my Power Port was I was able to dive, the port is good to 60m."
cancer,3dzlbu,billyvnilly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:12 2015 UTC,"Its not really tethered to the muscle but to the stretchy connective tissue over the muscle.  The best analogy is a rubber band.  With your thumb stationary, use your index finger to stretch the rubber band out evenly.  now pinch about 1/4 inch / 1 cm of it with your other hand and try to stretch it the same distance.  That pinched amount of rubber band (which isn't stretching) prevents the whole rubber band stretching its maximum distance."

It was a long-ass surgery (~8 hrs) and I felt pretty bad after I woke up but it was mainly from the anesthesia.  The pain was very manageable, but I pretended it was worse so that I could maximize that sweet, sweet morphine drip!  I was in the hospital for a few days and then went home.  It was very stiff but getting in and out of cars was very possible.    I hung out at home for a week or so and then took a road trip across the state and was camping and hiking.  Two weeks after my surgery I went kitesurfing!!!  A few days after that, I went on a sailing trip into Lake Superior for a few days.   I sheepishly told my surgeon this at the 1 month follow-up and expected him to chew me out for risking tearing the incisions (particularly at the kidney site) or getting infections from swimming.  Instead, he was super stoked and said he wanted to interview me for advertising for the robotic/laproscopic nephrectomies!    The best part:  I'm still cancer free 3 years later!

Also, if your shower doesn't have a detachable head on a hose type thing - go out and buy one and install it now. You can't get your incisions wet for a few days after (you'll likely leave with an open wound from the drainage tube) and you're going to want to shower. It'll be so much easier to do with a shower head you can detach and move around. Also, washing your hair will be hard without getting your wounds wet - I found bending forward and spraying my head was good enough."

cancer,3dzon7,bros402,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:51 2015 UTC,"Have something like  a small pillow to put under back after surgery - hours anaethatised motionless may make your lower back very painfully stiff.   Have those pre moistened cleanser baby wipes  handy to swab yourself clean because you may not be able to shower for a few days. If you still have hair, some spray in dry shampoo for the same reason, and detangler if your hair is long.  A dressing gown because you'll probably have a drain (plastic tube draining into bag to drain fluid off surgical site) and the dressing gown makes that easy access. Also maybe a catheter for urine, again dressing gown opening at front just makes it easy access.  Loose drawstring pajamas/trackpants - elastic or any kind of tightness is not going to be very comfortable on your abdomen for a while. Drawstring is good bbecause you can tighten or loosen as needed.  Nintendo dual screen is good diversion when movement is limited I find.  As far as constipation from pain killers go, I've found that holding off on the painkillers will fix the constipation and I spend a couple of hours in pain till I squeeze one out, then take the painkiller once it's done, as early post surgery (a day or so after I've eaten enough to make bowel motion neccessary) as possible, but YMMV with that one, not an ideal solution for everyone."

cancer,3dvjof,Burplessfart,2,Sun Jul 19 21:53:21 2015 UTC,"Brachyherapy is a very effective treatment for some categories of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer can usually be followed very well with the PSA blood test after this procedure.  It can take a couple of years though for the PSA to reach its lowest levels after brachy, and then it is monitored for many years after that to determine if it is staying down. Sometimes on the way down it can bounce up a bit first, but we don't get too concerned about that.   Just trying to set your expectations that if this is the first visit after brachy, you should be hopeful that the number is heading down, and that this is a very effective treatment. In most cases that brachy alone is selected for (more than 8-9/10), the cancer is cured. However knowing for sure that the PSA is staying down is a longer timeframe"

As with any treatment there are some side effects. Other than operative risk of bleeding and infection, one of the main issue with seed placement is urinary problems a few weeks after the procedure (burning, sometimes problem going -- can lead to urinary retention, which may require a catheter for a few days). If I was given the choice, it's probably the treatment I would choose for myself.  It is ""operator dependent"" to a certain extent, but as far as I know South African doctors are well trained (one of my mentor was from South Africa -- I'm Canadian)"

I'm not sure what state you're in but I'm in Florida and we have many patients that are on Medicare and Medicaid with Medicare part D for prescriptions.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was in fourth grade, but had been in remission for decades (I'm 39 now). But she had some pain in her abdomen and thought she had kidney stones and went in to urgent care. The doctor actually yelled at her, saying, ""don't you take care of yourself at all? You have cancer all over!"" It was in her breast, abdomen, spine, hip, and lung.  I just wanted to post to let you know that my mom has made it almost four years since then. She's in hospice now, but we've had a lot more time than we first thought. Your mom's situation may be bad and it may be good to prepare for some really tough news, but please try not to panic. Cancer treatment is so, so much better than it used to be. It's tough, but try to hang in there and wait to let the medical staff evaluate her situation and give you a clearer picture of what's ahead."

I guess most people that get an allo tend to get a fever at the nadir of the counts, and they send infectious disease to talk to you and have contact precautions and yadda yadda but it almost never turns out to be something serious. I also remember that I couldn't eat solid foods for about two and a half weeks after transplant. If you want anyone to talk to about allo transplants or have questions or anything, feel free to PM.

That seems awfully sudden. As someone who has been living with stage 4 colon cancer for almost 3 years now, it seems odd to me that stage 3 would take him down in a week. If he really is gone, I'm sorry, and my advice isn't much use, but assuming you're just being a bit over-dramatic, here's my advice anyway.  Sign up for Social Security Disability. Cite section 13.18 of the blue book on your application, they won't question you. Here's a link to the relevant blue book section: http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/13.00-NeoplasticDiseases-Malignant-Adult.htm#13_18   He qualifies for 100% disability. He won't get any benefits from it for 5 months (standard wait time), but he will be approved immediately, which will help push thru any other financial/medical assistance you apply for. Having a disability award letter in-hand makes the application process for other assistance significantly easier.  Call the American Cancer Society. They exist to help you. They can give you state-specific information on how to get signed up for medicaid, or whatever your state's version of it is. They have programs to help you pay for gas to and from doc appointments. There are all sorts of assistance programs available, and ACS can point you in the right direction.  Find your hospital's social services department, and make use of it. The hospital knows you can't navigate this stuff yourself, so they pay people to help you. Let them do their job. They will help with the disability stuff, the medicaid stuff, etc. They know what programs are available to help you out, and will help you get signed up for whatever's available.  I'm sorry you're having to deal with this, and I hope for the best for your dad. If he is already gone, the disability stuff is pointless, but the ACS and Social Services stuff still applies. Both exist to help you. Let them."

If the dad has assets - including home equity - those assets will be considered part of his estate. Those assets will be divided up among his creditors (including the medical providers) following a formula that is state-specific.  The house may well need to be sold, but it is possible for it to be sold to one or more of ""the three kids"" if they qualify for financing. One or all of them needs to be talking to an estate attorney.  Check and see if dad had life insurance payable to the kids. This money is NOT part of dad's estate and creditors cannot touch it. (They will try.)  It's possible there is enough life insurance to pay off the house. I carry enough life insurance to pay off my house, plus a policy on my ex-wife that is more than enough to pay off her house (so that my sons will not be immediately homeless)."

cancer,3do14v,deucesx,13,Fri Jul 17 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"When I was diagnosed and dealing with my treatment, I hated people asking me to talk about my problems.  Then again, I had super-overbearing family constantly overstepping their boundaries by trying to take care of me as if I was a child and it was undermining my sense of control over my situation.  That might not be what he's experiencing if he doesn't have a support system in place.  A lot of my friends gave me passive well wishes that didn't have any meaning behind them.  My best friend and my brother treated me the best possible way they could have.  They were worried about me, but they understood that I needed them to continue being who they were for me, rather than turn into some soapbox on which I could cry.  They were willing to have those conversations with me, and I knew that not because they said so, but because they continued to spend time with me as normal.  It let me relax and have fun and talk, and when I felt like I was feeling my emotions naturally rather than being forced into it by probing questions or sympathetic/pitiful glances, it was a lot nicer to be able to open up.  But that shouldn't be your goal.  Just spend time with the guy if he's able to.  I didn't have to deal with chemo, but I've known a few who have and it can be really, really physically taxing, so he may not be up for visits.  However, don't let that stop you from showing interest in doing so if that's really what you want to do.  Another really good friend of mine who knew what I was going through randomly called me the day after my surgery to see how I was doing.  I was still in the ICU and everything.  My childhood friends hadn't made a peep about how I was doing across my entire diagnosis and that really hurt... yet here was this person I'd known less than a year calling me, joking about how gnarly my incision was, asking if she could come visit me in the ICU because she happened to be in the area.  Having someone who was willing to be forward and excited about spending time with me lifted my spirits like crazy.  But then, that's the sort of person that she is and no one should put on a facade to get a certain outcome, because that stuff is super transparent.  I don't know, man.  I know you want to be there for the guy... so try to be.  Ask him what his limitations are now that he's doing treatment.  Is he up for getting out of the house and going to a movie?  The beach?  A bar?  Lunch?  Let him know you'd like to come by with a six-pack and have a beer.  Or that you'd like to have him over for dinner.  Just whatever feels like a natural thing for you.  But yeah, you don't want to push it.  You just want to show that your intentions aren't empty.  As long as you do that, if he declines, then there's not much more to be done.  Sometimes it can be enough to know people are there for you, even if you don't utilize that support system too much.  I wish you and your friend the best, buddy."

I had just graduated from college and was the only one of my friends to stay in the same state, and that was halfway across the country from where I grew up. My parents were wildly unsupportive (couldn't be bothered to get on a plane and see me), so losing my ex was even more devastating. Quite honestly, it made me THISCLOSE to refusing treatment. It was a dark time.  The people who kept reaching out, even if I didn't respond, were wonderful. Make sure he has support. Does he have family close by? Going through cancer without a caregiver isn't something I'd wish on my worst enemy. Make sure he has someone with him to help him when he gets home from the hospital, someone to help with laundry, cooking, and cleaning. Offer concrete help - say you will bring by food on X date. And that you will drop it off if he doesn't feel up for visiting.   Lots of people will tell him that they will ""Help in any way they can"" and ""Just ask."" Don't make him ask - most of us are loathe to."

They prioritized going to Scotland for two weeks (we're in the US, though separated by 1000 miles) in month 4 of ABVD when my counts really tanked - and they booked their travel AFTER my diagnosis. My mom had claimed money problems for years so I felt too guilty to be a ""burden"" and insist that they come, because I wanted them to want to come - you know? They claimed they couldn't financially help me either (4 months into my first job out of college) but had no problem dropping thousands of dollars on travel and now, a few years later (with no change in financial situation - my dad has been unemployed for years) are dropping over $10,000 for my younger brother's wedding.

My mom is a classic narcissist and my dad has both physical and mental health issues of his own, and my illness just trigger them both and it was easier to keep me out of sight.

Just be strong, be the stronger voice. If it is the worst case scenario, take a deep breathe and stay calm. The doctors know the exact treatment required to contain and try to kill the cancerous cells.

It makes me immediately nauseous in the way that I have only ever felt during chemo and sparks my anxiety for the rest of the day.

cancer,3diygt,flying_unicorn,2,Thu Jul 16 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"My dad has es-sclc as well. Large part of his left lung, kidney, bones (ribs and spine) and lymph nodes. He has had 5 rounds of Chemo (3 days with 3 weeks off) of the etopiside and carboplatin. I honestly had no hope for Chemo but after his last ct scan there was actually a difference.  I wonder how the clinical trial will help, they haven't given us that option yet.  Once he is done his 6th round of Chemo they are starting him on radiation.  Hopefully your dad takes well to the treatment."
cancer,3diygt,hustle-x-rose,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"they told us radiation wasn't an option because of it was not contained to the lung.  So I'm surprised to hear in your dad's case they're doing it.  I'm super excited to hear that there was a difference with just the chemo.  I don't have very high hopes for the chemo either, but it's reassuring to hear that.  I hope your dad continues to respond to the chemo.  How has he been doing on the chemo?  Side affects and what not? Is he tolerating them well so far?"
cancer,3diygt,hustle-x-rose,2,Fri Jul 17 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"They said they want to do the radiation to the brain since this type of cancer spreads quickly to the brain so its for preventative measures. Which sounds kind of bull to me. Radiation to his chest because I guess when they respond well to the chemo the radiation helps make more room in the esophagus for food to go down. They are also doing radiation to a part of his spine/hip area where he gets the most pain from the cancer that spread to his bones.  He really isn't looking forward to it because its everyday for about 30 minutes for 2 weeks. He hates having appointments.   I was actually very shocked with the difference from the Chemo. I was expecting him to go quickly (by the end of April) and now they have approved him being able to go to the mountains in September. He still only has weeks-months left but it shocked me to see the difference in the scan.   He seems to have taken to chemo well, hasn't really made him sick. His hair thinned a lot so we shaved his head and beard. The steroids they give him during the first week keeps him wired all day and night, as long as he keeps up on his medication he doesn't get nauseated or sick. He has gained about 14 pounds so they like that.  His 5th round of Chemo was rough for the first day but that was strange. He puked twice before even starting the chemo and then continued to be sick the whole day and night but fine the next morning, so I just figured it was bad food or something. He also got pneumonia between rounds 3 & 4 which made me think it was the end but they loaded him up with antibiotics and he was fine.   He gets the Neulasta shot after every treatment and that's really the only thing that gives him trouble. 4 days after getting it his whole body aches and tingles really bad.   He would sleep all day everyday after the first week since he would be all done taking the steroids. Constantly sleeping and upset that he is wasting his time sleeping. The palliative care team decided to give him some Ritalin to keep his energy up and he is insanely high energy now. It's good but soooooo draining for everyone around him. My husband and I are in bed before he is.   Hopefully your dad tolerates it well and doesn't get too many side affects. Have you noticed any yet?"
cancer,3diygt,Labrat33,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:30:24 2015 UTC,Prophylactic cranial radiation is standard for anyone with small cell lung cancer who responds to first line treatment. There is very good data that patients who get radiation do better than those who do not.
cancer,3dj8mx,MikeyInvest,2,Thu Jul 16 18:38:12 2015 UTC,My grandfather passed from angiosarcoma and my mother has just this week been put in hospice battling adenosarcoma. The best advice I can give is to find a soft tissue sarcoma specialist as quickly as you can. I don't know where you live but my mother was treated at University of Michigan and I truly believe the care she got prolonged her survival a great deal. Sarcoma is very aggressive and rare and it should be treated by a specialist.
cancer,3dhx6h,Mattknight19,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:23:41 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry that you are going through this. I went through something very similar back in March with my father. I spent hours online reading as much as I could about it. It took a while for the doctors to find out exactly what type of lung cancer he had but once it was figured out treatment started immediately.  I would tell your mom to give her more time so she can look things up herself and find people to talk to.  It came as a complete shock to my family too.

No one deserves to be going through such a terrible situation! I've been researching all the various medication breakthroughs and so forth, but this maybe all irrelevant when given the results of the type of cells.  It's great to look at the statistics of how many successfully respond to treatment these days! Best wishes to your father and your family!"

My mum showed 0 symptoms but she has stage 4 spread to her spine bones and her brain. The only symptoms i see now are from the drugs shes taking.... funny that. I've done hours of research, about lung cancer so if you need any help or have any questions ask out. I recommend when more testing has been done to see if there are any mutations like EGFR, ALK etc if its Non small cell lung cancer. Those types of lung cancer have a more targeted drug which has less side effects.  Keep us updated and good luck!"

However, I take it she's reacting well to the treatment in that you're not seeing any deterioration in health! How are you and your family dealing with it 2 months on? I suppose the feeling of breaking into tears gradually disappears as it becomes more a way of life? Just another long term obstacle?  He has a couple of more tests to see whether its harmful or harmless coming up, and I suppose to clarify a specific type, but I keep telling him in the worst case scenario the amount of treatment available is astonishing and success rates are increasing. I think he's terrified because his father passed at 55 due to lung cancer, but he'd been a heavy smoker all of his life.   I really appreciate the response though, and I do meant that! Even though it feels like your world has collapsed, it always helps you focus knowing you're not alone in such an awful situation.  I hope your mum continues to respond well. I'm sure you've looked at all options, but I must mention about proton therapy? It's curing an astonishing amount of people with brain cancer, and if you've not tried, European doctors seem to be regarding it highly!"

So she needed Whole Brain Radiation.  She seems to be handling treatment well, the radiation is making her very fatigue and just yesterday got a Urine Infection which is causing alot of pain for her. but this is probably from her lowered immune system and the medication shes on.  Its a hard story to be honest, I live in a different city so I fly down to see her for a week every Month as work lets me work remote. My mum and my brother live together and thats about it. At the start i felt like my life was a blur but now its more of an obstacle and just got to get through it together.   Its hard for me sometimes as I wish i was back where my mum is to look after her when stuff gets low. I presume my brother must get it very rough as well considering hes 15. but we all understand what the situation is and what we need to do.  Let me know how you dad goes!

See this is my concern as I just graduated from University a week ago, I'm on a job search that could take me anywhere but it's an awkward time to commit to moving away.  But anyway, dad will be getting his test and results in the next couple of weeks I believe so I will update you! My mum was really upset as my dad was on such a downer, he didn't really say that they only know something is there .. whether it's cancerous or not is still another matter! So once I spoke to her and calmed her down, we're all back and settled.  One major concern is that the doctor will say to my dad that if it's the worst news, it'll be ""terminal"" or ""your life expectancy is ..."", it's something my dad doesn't need or want to know so I'm going to be calling his main doctor to make sure none of that is said! I'd rather he were hopeful with the treatment than be depressed by a statistic! I don't know if you happened to have any experience with that?? Not that I'm saying your mum is terminal as brain tumours are very well monitored now, but whether this talk came up???"

cancer,3dhbc6,theslymoogle,2,Thu Jul 16 07:20:03 2015 UTC,Hi there. I've recently received news that my dad has a brain tumour and things don't look good. I think you just have to ask what he wants but remember that quality of life is the most important thing now rather than the length of it. Maybe he will want to do chemo but also make the most of his time on his good days and blow some money. I know the road ahead for my dad and our family is shitty so I'll think of you at my shittiest times and you can know someone else is going through it and figuratively holding your hand sometimes.
cancer,3dhbc6,gangaftaglee,2,Thu Jul 16 08:25:38 2015 UTC,"Hi. I am going through this EXACT same scenario with my Dad (63). He was diagnosed 2 months ago with Stage 4 Heptocellular Carcinoma with mastitis to the lymph nodes and who knows where else. We faced this same decision together. He is not a candidate for transplant or resection. He is going to die. Chemo might extend his life for a few months, but will make him sick, and he is already on so many meds from multiple doctors, he doesnt want it. Plus, its crazy expensive, and he doesnt see how spending that much $ for a sickly few more months makes sense.  So now, 2 months later, he is really weak and get tired fast. In 2 months he went from caring for himself, driving, going to the grocery store to having a hard time getting around the house by himself. More recently, he has begun resisting eating and complaining of abdomen pain, which is scary, but we are managing. He is in the ultimate environment, little house by the ocean on a Caribbean Island. He has it good, I am right next door, and he seems to be coping okay. I know the end is near, and Im terrified.  TLDR; My Dad has liver cancer and is not a candidate for surgical options, so there was no hope. We said no to chemo, he's slowly deteriorating but he is well cared for."

Spending any savings is OK though.  If it were me at age 79 I'm pretty sure I would decline chemo. For the most part it makes you wish you were dead.

I was 65, and sedentary when I started a 5 month series. I only needed the anti-nausea meds once, had no problems with constipation or diarrhea, ate something every day. I had to be out of work straight through, more for scheduling of subs than for my condition. I did lose my hair about 2 weeks in, and I did take Claritin one day because of back spasms. Steroids kept me awake if they were administered too late in the day. Other than the above, it wasn't all that bad, really. I was in an exercise clinical study, where I did some resistance band training and walking (almost) every day. While it wasn't a piece of cake, it sure wasn't the nightmare I'd been told to expect. Your mileage may vary. I hope you do as well as I did.   *yes, chemo brain, mouth sores, sleep issues, fatigue, lost toenails (surprise!), other little annoyances, but I stress...little.

I also felt ok after the first week. I went every 4 weeks for 4 days.  But I had a few bad weeks, mostly because I wasn't careful about managing the constipation or drinking/eating enough.  When the constipation got bad, then the nausea got bad, then I wasn't eating enough, etc.  it was a bad circle.  So I had to be careful about drinking plenty of water, eating healthy even when everything tastes bad, and not letting the constipation go for too long.  It's hard because you just get tired.

The funny thing is that when you feel good - however bad you felt doesn't seem to be as bad. Only tip I can think of is to be consistent taking your meds.

We have chemo cocktails of different drugs because it takes a multi-pronged approach to deal with most cancers.  I wish I had advice for you on how to approach this. Its another form of illness to lie about having a life-threatening illness. There are also cases where people never had cancer at all but convince themselves of it, and then convince themselves that they cured it through herbs.

Your only choice at that point is to move to Oregon and apply for the services,  or become a criminal and hope our  legal system will have mercy.    I think it is a real shame when we let religious groups dictate our personal health care choices.  People needlessly suffer or are criminalized because of it."

Is he eligible to treat with chemo to try and stall the growing to prolong life?    Once you reach 'inoperable' you have to look at life as a quality vs quantity debate.

I know for a fact my dad would rather try to get some movement back in his leg again and have a good few months strolling up the garden with my mum than a year of being completely dependent.  They are going to do radio/chemo I think. But we still don't know much about the tumour. Apparently it has got smaller since the original diagnosis 2 weeks ago which obviously can be bad, but there hasn't even been a biopsy yet.   It's little things that upset me most, like the thought that he won't be there when I get married, he won't meet my future children etc.   Sorry to hear you have gone through this, too. This experience for all its shittiness has made me see just how good and kind people can be."

I'm 31, finished the whole chemo regimen for leukemia, and have been in 'maintenance' chemo for about 15 months now (got about 9 to go). Like yourself, I lost a ton of weight during chemo. During maintenance, I gained a lot - but not necessarily in a good way.   I'm still weak and tired all the time and frequently sick. If you get into remission and have to do maintenance, they'll probably tell you that you can start living a normal life. It's bullshit. It takes time.  I don't know how much you can do, besides try and find some peace knowing there's a long road ahead. You can't do much about your body falling apart, but you can do the hard work of maintaining a positive outlook, finding things that excite you enough to get out of bed every day.  Walking is a great idea - I would always walk, even when you feel horrible."
cancer,3dewa9,podsixia,2,Wed Jul 15 21:20:57 2015 UTC,"Well I'm glad you're in remission and hope you stay there. Do you have any experience with ""chemo brain"". I think that's what's been messing with me the most. Also, if you don't mind, I know that maintenance for me I supposed to involve regular lumbar puncture chemos and some kind of daily pill chemo. If that is similar to your situation how do you feel that affects you now that you're at this point?  Thanks for the advice it's nice to be able to relate to someone."
cancer,3dewa9,podsixia,3,Wed Jul 15 21:40:32 2015 UTC,"What type of leukemia do you have? (ALL here)  Chemo brain - totally. I still don't feel the same.  I'm less sharp and less articulate for sure. It's frustrating, to say the least, and I'm sure it's hard to be 24 and trying to live with these sorts of limitations.:(  I had 20 lumbar punctures, the last one was about 2 months into maintenance. I take daily pills and get a monthly IV. They used to give me a bunch of other drugs with the IV, but I couldn't handle it. Maintenance seems to mean giving the patient as much chemo as they can handle without making them immunocompromised again.   If you're treated similarly, they will give you as much chemo as you can handle and scale it back over time. My comments earlier were based on my experience with this regimen. In sort, maintenance chemo: not as good as advertised."
cancer,3dewa9,bookingly,3,Wed Jul 15 22:18:39 2015 UTC,Dude ALL here too! Damn I am NOT happy to hear that about maintenance because like you said it's been advertised as nice. So we are doing pretty much the same treatment. Still after reading these forums I'm grateful to be alive.  I'm going tomorrow and am going to have them let up because the IV methotrexate is killing me.  And I've only gotten like 8 LPs but they might give me a break since it the cancer never got to my spine. Anyway keep me updated on your situation.

I was 18 with my own diagnosis and treatment, but you just keep trying to figure out what small things you can do and just try to be at peace with that as much as possible.  It really sucks going from being active and healthy and doing normal young adult things to such a feeble state, but I would say just try to focus getting through this and making up for this time later and finding those things in life now that resonate with you and help make life good for you.

But just try to find some maybe even very small thing that you can figure out to make life just that much better in the short term.  You are having to go through a quite significant ordeal, and I would say just try to do what you can to find some relief.  Focus on getting through the next chemo treatment and then focus on what comes after that.  Just take each step at a time and make due the best you can!  Or take my advice and just disregard it - cancer can be a very unique experience, and it can be challenging finding the best way to respond to your own particular case.  I do hope you can get through it though!"
cancer,3dewa9,Luke_Emiya,3,Wed Jul 15 23:44:11 2015 UTC,"ALL here! diagnosed at 29! totally sucked cause I turned 30 and had gone through a break up. I lost a good 25 lbs and then got fat cause of prednisone and decadron.  anyway, I was an athlete until I graduated from college and continued to maintain a similar level of fitness via crossfit. If it wasn't for crossfit and lifting, I probably wouldn't have figured out I had leukemia.   Anyway - during the first phase of chemo (intensification) I walked my dog like 3 miles a day and started doing moderate lifting. Eventually I started running again and did a few 200 mile relays with friends and some half marathons along with some lifting competitions. Your body will get back to what it was capable of before chemo. you just gotta get up and go.  ps - currently in maintenance with IV vincristine, IT methotrexate and oral meth as well. chemo days are rest days but I go hard the next day."

If at all possible I'll be right there with ya in spirit hitting the gym and burning through shoes on the track as soon as I get into maintenance.  You are literally the first person I've found that lives that level of fitness after ALL so it's an incredible relief to hear your story. I also found out about the leukemia because of the quick and unexplainable performance drop when working out.

cancer,3dewa9,Lunosmt,3,Tue Jul 21 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"I had ALL and would love to say it gets easier but it will keep getting harder till maintenance.  It will get easier for a time and get harder again towards the end.  I was on a two year treatment cycle, I was lucky I was treated at a cutting edge hospital in Canada with one of the better programs.  After 9 month I had the Hickman line out and had it replaced with a port, that was a god send.   Year two you will be able to be more active but to not expect to get back into shape, just try to keep the steroid pounds off with light working out.  I found the chemo brain gets better but will not go away till after the end of the treatment.     As for recovery it will be slower then expected, you will need a month to come off meds and get your body back to some sort of new normal.  I was in perfect health before getting sick, 1:45 half marathon, done Ulta marathons and Iron Man, so I feel your pain.  I am happy to say post treament about 60 days out I was able to get back into working out.  It has been slow but I can now spend longer and longer working out.  I am up to 1800m in the pool, and 60km on the bike.  The treatment coused lots of problems for my feet so I have not been able to run yet, as I find it to hard on the body.  I also am a few pounds more then before, I dropped to 140 from 180 and back up to 215. I am now at 195 but trading fat for strengths so I am ok with the stall for now.     PM me if you have any questions, you have a long hard road.  The good news is it is better then dead."

cancer,3dewa9,orangechimera,2,Tue Jul 21 02:39:15 2015 UTC,Body recovers very fast after you finish treatment. Sometimes even within weeks. Don't give up. Talk to doctors about ways to minimize side effects and improving life quality. There are many drugs that can help. Just speak about everything don't try to keep it secret and try to cope with it yourself.

cancer,3dewa9,bros402,2,Wed Jul 15 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"you have to understand that most cancer treatment is to just wreck everything in your body. The cancer cells are very bad at repairing the damage and hopefully just die. You are going to feel like crap all through treatment, no way around it really. Once you are done though you can try to pick up the pieces. I think having hobbies to take your mind off it all help. Don't try to push the gym, but light activity is good, like walking."

cancer,3dfc1q,DrEagerBeaver,2,Wed Jul 15 22:41:29 2015 UTC,"Firstly, my best wishes to your family and your mother through this difficult time. Secondly, I wanted to respond because leptomeningeal spread is a difficult topic for patients and their families to attempt to research or understand, as there isn't a large amount of information available.  Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is relatively rare and occurs in around 5% of people with metastatic disease, most commonly when patients have breast, lung or colon cancer, or melanoma. It occurs when cancer cells get between two of the coverings of the brain - these tumours will not resolve completely even with treatment, and they will eventually grow and increase in number throughout the whole brain.  We generally put people with leptomeningeal spread into two groups depending on their prognosis, and this allows us to make a decision about the risks and benefits of pursuing treatment.   Patients with poorer prognoses tend to be managed with palliative symptom control and preservation of existing quality-of-life for as long as possible.   When patients have a better short-term prognosis and wish to pursue treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy to try and shrink the size of the tumours around the brain may help restore some quality of life - the methods you have mentioned are two ways of doing this.   Prognosis is highly variable among patients such as your mother and I would encourage you to ask all the questions you have when you see her oncologist, either informally or in the context of a family meeting."

That things have changed so permanently that today can't possibly be the same reality as yesterday.   It sounds like you and your father had a great relationship. I think from the father's point of view, he is glad to know his influence lives on through his son, through the qualities and love that he passed on. At least this is how I'm dealing with my grandfather's passing. He was the primary father figure to me, and I know he is proud of the fact that his qualities, values, live on through the close bond we had.

It's hard to find people who understand losing a parent around this age. You're not a kid, but you're not quite grown up. I just wanted to say, don't worry about feeling cliche. Previously, I've actually worried about how much grief I'm allowed to feel, but fuck that.

From the moment we were told that she wasn't going to make it to sometime after she passed, I felt like I was living a nightmare that I desperately wanted to wake from.  If you considered yourself a strong and resilient person, then you can make it through this. I don't think losing a parent this young is something a person ever gets over, we just learn to live with it. I have a friend who lost his dad 2 Christmas's ago, and both my girlfriend's parents lost their moms in their early 20's (now they're in their 40's). None of them are over it...

cancer,3dbn94,litchick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"The way you describe it, the way your dad passed away... Sounds just like when I lost my dad as an 11-year-old which was in 2005.  I had a relatively happy childhood up to that point but I don't think I have ever cried as much as the day I had to see my dad die.   I think you sound strong though. You are in touch with yourself and your feelings. Losing a parent is always hard even if you're over 20 and independant. Just remember, and I know it's probably too soon to say, even if you don't immediately feel like it, therapy or group therapy might be a good idea.   My mom told me she thought I should have that back when my dad died and I said ""no, I don't want to talk to other people about it"" and insisted so she didn't make me. She said I could become depressed if I put a lid on my feelings. I just didn't realize how true it was but here I am, 21 years old struggling with severe social and health anxiety and on-off depression.   I don't know how it works, but just stay true to your feelings, mourn your dad, talk to family, friends and don't forget him. Just as long as you don't start putting a lid on it, because you're right to be emotional in this situation.   The best wishes to you from me, and may your dad rest in peace :)"

Frankly, at this point his drinking and smoking are not going to significantly shorten his life any more than they already have. It's pretty pointless to argue with him about that.  Try not to be his mother. If anything, pretend to be his nurse and stay professional.

Currently he is able to be up and out of the house doing whatever it is he wants to do. I'm just not sure if it's constant care or if they just stop by a couple of times a day.  **especially around the end. watching my grandmother die in the hospital there was nurses coming in every 15-30 minutes to check on her, for days. At the end they started suctioning stuff out of her mouth and all that other nurse stuff. I get anxious enough just having to fix bandages on his PICC line. If it was any other person I would be okay but because it's my dad I'm just scared to do the wrong thing."

The radiation treatments did indeed cause fatigue. So will the Gefitinib.  My wife was given a very similar drug, Erlotinib. After nine months of treatment her cancers (as many as 30) have shrunk by over 90%.  If your wife is taking any PPIs (Prilosec, Nexium, etc) she must stop immediately. PPIs raise the pH of the stomach to a level that strongly inhibits absorption of the drug. Our oncologist instead substituted twice daily zantac, at least 2hours after taking erlotinib and at most 8 hours before.   I've been told that Adenosquamous is a very aggressive form of cancer. Does that mean its aggressive as in spreading? or the rate of growth?   It usually means both."
cancer,3dcgmo,lucky_ducker,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:16:15 2015 UTC,The good thing i guess is shes only on Gefitinib & a steriod called dexamethazon?? to help with the swelling.  Shes on a painkiller called Oxycontin/OxyNorm to help with a pain on her lumbar bone.  I'm glad to hear your wife is doing well with her treatment. All i can do is wait till the next CT scan to see the new results.  I'll be sure to keep you updated.
cancer,3dcgmo,lucky_ducker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:12:48 2015 UTC,"Dexamethasone is a potent steriod, about 10 times stronger than prednisone.  Very necessary when receiving radiation and during recovery, but it has its own side effects.  Her doctor will taper her off the steroid after a few weeks at the most.  Oxycontin is a time-release oxycodone, an opiate painkiller.  My wife stopped these several weeks ago, because her doctor would not clear her to drive while on narcotics."

cancer,3da54x,youngandaimless_,2,Tue Jul 14 18:12:54 2015 UTC,"I said this on a previous thread to someone who's wife was about to lose their father to Cancer, but thought I would share here as well:    As someone who lost their mom to Pancreatic Cancer, the best thing you can do is be there for your wife, be her shoulder to cry on, be her punching bag when the anger she will feel comes up (this one is very difficult for someone to deal with because the anger will manifest itself at the most random times), help her with minuscule tasks around the house that she might normally take care of. Take the burden of those chores off her shoulders for a while. The absolute last thing I wanted to deal with when I was about to lose my mom and for the weeks after was the day to day tasks that life requires (laundry, cleaning, etc). As your wife's biggest supporter, you need to be 100% selfless right now. This is incredibly difficult for most people. You have to put your needs/wants/desires aside for a period of time and give yourself unconditionally to your wife. Let me give you an example... my wife could not grasp the concept of selflessness... she literally got furious with me about not getting her the ice cream cake she wanted for her birthday a mere 8 days after I found out my mom was diagnosed. Guess what? 3 months later my mom was gone, there are no more birthdays of hers to celebrate, while my wife will get another bday (most likely). It's been almost a year and I still have not been able to forgive my wife for this selfishness (and others during the battle) in my biggest time of need."

Agree that coffee and Activia won't help much. The combination of chemo, opioids and probably some of the anti-nausea medication (ondansetron or another similar sounding medication - 5-HT3 inhibitors) will make you constipated no matter what you do. Drinking lots of water helps, but in reality won't change things much either.  Either way, I recommend you discuss this with your physician before it becomes a bigger problem."

I've never addressed them though, as I've had more pressing matters to deal with (the metastases in my liver, lungs, and adrenal glands).   I think going to a GI doctor is probably a good idea. Pain management doctors are available too, but they just treat the symptoms, not the source. A GI may be able to actually help you with your problems. Hopefully they'll pass you around between doctors long enough that you eventually find relief. Unfortunately, with vague things like ""pain and pooping"", it's sometimes hard to nail down an exact cause. Keep going though, the only way to figure out for sure what the problem is is sometimes to just eliminate all other possibilities. That takes much time and many doctors. Best of luck to you."

Another alternative is to send it to the cholangiocarcinoma foundation (cholangiocarcinoma.org)  (Cholangiacarcinoma is the medical name for bile duct cancer).

Most people aren't so lucky and, even with the ACA in the US, rely on charity care to get treatment as well as for logistical help at home. One of my lowest moments was sobbing on the phone with my social worker when my American Cancer Society ride volunteer fell through at 10PM the night before my first chemo and I had no idea how I would get to treatment. Thankfully, a coworker was able to do it (so embarrassing asking) but my hospital was ready to pay for an ambulance out of their charity budget to get me there.  Local hospitals do so much good and some of the major ones, like my own Dana Farber and hospitals like MD Anderson, City of Hope, and Memorial Sloan Kettering do significant research on their own."

After that I'll have a PET scan and meet with a radiation oncologist as well.   I was also curious and nervous about the radiation and asked about it. I was told that the chemo is tougher. The advice I've gotten is that the treatments make you very tired, you lose any hair where the beams are targeted, you tend to have a hard time swallowing so soft foods and Klacks solution are helpful, and sometimes there is irritation where the beam points.   There are a lot of people on here who will be happy to answer your questions in more depth with actual experience. They helped me to not be as nervous about the radiation."

cancer,3d7e4k,rcowie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:44:34 2015 UTC,"The fast heartbeat, the sweating, dizziness and headache. It’s only a matter of time before the start of the main event—otherwise known as the hot flash.  Hot flashes brought on by chemotherapy aren’t talked about, the way hair loss and nausea are. But because some chemo meds damage the ovaries, it’s not uncommon to experience the sudden rush of heat normally associated with menopause, as well as other menopausal symptoms, such as energy loss and irritability.  How to deal with hot flashes You don’t have to live with hot flashes. To keep cool, talk to your healthcare provider, and check out these 8 tips:  Pinpoint—and avoid—your triggers, which can range from alcohol and caffeine to spicy foods and smoking. Other culprits include hot tubs and saunas. Keeping a hot-flash diary may help you spot patterns. Wear lots of light layers. Start with moisture-wicking underwear, then add tops, cardigans and light knits made of breathable cotton. As your internal temperature fluctuates, you can easily shed or add layers as needed. Shun wool, rayon, synthetics and silk, which can seal in moisture; skip turtlenecks in favor of open-neck tops; and, no matter the season, stick to pale colors. If you can’t stand the heat, go to the kitchen—and open the freezer! Let the frigid air hit your face for several seconds. While you’re there, grab a bag of frozen veggies and place it on your chest or anywhere else you’re feeling the heat. Toss baby wipes into your tote. On the go when a hot flash hits? Simply moisten your face, neck or other hot spot with a wipe. Then, cool your moistened skin even more with a handheld fan (paper or battery-operated). Keep ice-cold H2O on hand. When the heat starts to rise, guzzle water. You’ll get relief from the feeling of cold water rushing down your throat and into your stomach, and it will lessen the flash’s severity. Send stress packing! Find your favorite healthy way to de-stress—meditation, massage, deep breathing—and practice it regularly: A study in the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management found that women who do just that have fewer and less severe hot flashes than women who don’t de-stress. Set the stage for a good night’s sleep. Lower the thermostat to about 67 degrees Fahrenheit, and use either a ceiling or table fan to circulate the air around your bed. Stick to cotton sheets and linens, and wear cotton or moisture-wicking nightwear. Before turning in, take a cool shower. Talk with your oncologist about two things: (1) Hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Taken in the short term, HRT can effectively manage hot flashes and other symptoms; and (2) supplements. Vitamin B complex, vitamin E and ibuprofen also have been found to bring relief. Ask your oncologist about the pros and cons of HRT, supplements and other medications. (Just note that people with breast cancer aren’t eligible for HRT.)"

Whether or not you return to normalcy or remain menopausal after chemo finishes depends on several factors. The closer you are to a normal menopausal age (45ish - 60ish) the more likely the menopause is permanent. Presumably then you being only 25 are in a position to return to normalcy after chemo ends.   Culprits other than chemo can cause hot flashes - liver tumours also disrupt hormone production and cause sweating and hot flashes.   Since you're getting regular blood tests for chemo, you may as well get your hormone levels measured in those blood tests, that way you'll know for sure where you stand with regard to hormone production."

Wait till your followup and see how your response is at 3 months.  Much less is known about CML in adolescents and young adults, and there aren't too many studies about the age group.

He feels that this progression is not at the average rate (slower than he wanted) so I'll be seeing a specialist at Dana Farber to get additional help (potentially different strategy).

It isn't unusual to have a few extra blasts at the time of diagnosis, and it doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as when the accelerated evolves out of chronic phase later on.  If in doubt, get a second opinion at an academic center from a leukemia specialist.  Having said that, you probably do have higher risk disease, and a second-generation TKI such as nilotinib or dasatinib is probably a better choice.  Best of luck."

cancer,3d3g70,bromatologist,6,Mon Jul 13 05:28:45 2015 UTC,"Okay. Don't jump on the whole organic juicing thing - it's not going to make much difference at this point, and if she wants to plunk down on the couch with a bag of Doritos and a pint of Ben & Jerry's, then that is what she should do. Food makes people happy, and happiness is so very important. Also, once her thyroid is out, her metabolism is going to shut down and the medication they give her at first probably won't pick up all the slack, so she'll have to watch what she eats if she doesn't want to gain a heap of weight - might as well enjoy food now.  Something a lot of people don't seem to know: cancer describes hundreds and hundreds of different diseases, which all have their root in a cellular mutation. All they have in common is that a cell went wrong, and the immune system didn't kill it. Otherwise, they're all completely different diseases, and looking at them on a holistic basis is not useful. Small cell lung cancer is not like cervical cancer, which is not like ALL, which is not like osteosarcoma, which is not like melanoma. They're all cancer, but they're not at all the same. Not even a little  So, thyroid cancer. Very, very survivable, depending on type - 90-95% of all thyroid cancers are papillary or follicular, and these have a 97% survival rate if identified in the early stages. If they're not rushing her in for surgery right this minute, then she's hopefully got one of the better types and it's not too far along. I'm not sure I'd go in for Crazy Sexy Cancer - I've never seen it, but from what I understand, she had a really awful, terrifying type of cancer (this is why I mention the bit about cancer being a bunch of diseases - she doesn't have anything like what the woman in the film had), and that's not relevant to what's happening to your boyfriend's sister. She's got what, annoyingly, is referred to as ""the good cancer."" Which is a load of horseshit. None of this is good. But thyroid cancer is manageable in most cases. The treatment consists of surgery and radioactive iodine ablation. No chemo (chemo doesn't work well on this type of cancer), no radiation unless the cancer does not respond to the iodine (this is a rare complication). The iodine treatment is exclusive to thyroid cancer - this one radioactive particle destroys thyroid cells, and leaves pretty much everything else alone.  Thyroid cancer patients often don't spend time on an oncology ward - I've never been on one. They spend time on a surgical ward, and then maybe they have the iodine treatment over a few days in an isolation suite in hospital (mine was in the endocrine unit), although often they just send them home with specific instructions about how to spend their time and staying away from people. After that, she'll start her long-term maintenance medication (synthetic thyroid hormones). Treatment is quick and relatively okay. She won't lose her hair, or become incredibly immune suppressed. She'll probably be a bit more susceptible to colds. I still get a lot of colds - but not everybody has that as a long-term issue.   Treat her normally. This really is a frustrating inconvenience - it's not the end of the world. I know it's scary - nobody's prepared for cancer, but the odds are on her side. It will continue to be a frustrating inconvenience for the next few months. It's going to be a mild inconvenience to her for the rest of her life - pills, occasional blood tests, and getting travel insurance can be a pain in the backside. I was well into stage II when mine was found - 23 years later, I'm still here, and I'm healthy. I'm not the exception - most of us come through pretty okay. Try to help her have as normal a time as she can now, as well as once she's through treatment - just do what you'd usually do. Once she's had the surgery, just try to be helpful - she's going to feel weird and sore and tired, and little things like running errands and bringing cups of tea help.   It's sweet that you're so concerned. Take a deep breath, and just try to be normal. If she wants to talk, let her talk. If not, then just act like it's any other day. It may feel like denial, but it's not. It's the rational response to the situation - this is a bad time, and it will pass. For all of you."
cancer,3d3g70,131i,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:16:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the very well thought out and helpful response. You hit the nail on the head with what you said about the different types of cancer, it’s still not a good diagnosis but we’re doing our best to be rational about it and understand that it’s not this all-encompassing, life-ruining thing. I got up this morning and she had been sleeping on the couch outside our bedroom, except she hadn’t slept at all. I hope she didn’t hear me crying last night, it was the first time I actually got really upset about it. I guess the hardest part right now is just dealing with the doctors and their unhelpful, annoyed secretaries while we try to get an appointment with the specialist to find out more info. I think the mom is fearing the worst, we all are, but all signs point to her ultimately being fine, there’s no reason to freak out. They cancelled their vacation, but now it turns out the specialist is on vacation, so that’s frustrating. It would really be nice to find out just what stage it’s at, it feels like we're in the dark regarding just how serious it is.      I will definitely hold off on looking up too much cancer-related stuff or watching that documentary. I didn’t really feel it was applicable to the situation at this point, as she doesn’t have anything near as bad as the woman in the film, and like you said will probably not even need chemotherapy. I am doing my best to keep my boyfriend from making too many dietary suggestions, I know he has her best interests at heart, but like you said we need to let her live a normal life. She eats healthy already and takes supplements anyway, but the doctor said to stop all supplements for now as something might aggravate the thyroid (she had been taking iodine, so this is definitely one thing she needed to stop). She’s not starting any crazy diet or anything, but I think at this point she has a sense of control over what she eats so if she chooses to feel like she’s doing something good by eating healthy then we absolutely support her. It’s not going to hurt her to have a green juice when she wants to, we usually juice some veggies a couple times a week. I don’t think she’s looked into a macrobiotic diet or anything like that. But she also bought some cookies and chips, so I’m trying to hold off eating those and leave them for her if she needs them :P    Thank you again for the info. I’m glad to hear you came through fine and you’ve made me feel much better about the diagnosis now hearing your story. We will continue things as normally as we can. We’re definitely not denying it, but we are trying not to over blow it either. Keeping melodrama contained in this Italian family is another story!"
cancer,3d3g70,Ezada,3,Mon Jul 13 14:57:12 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I know this story all to well, but I was the one with Thyroid Cancer. They found it last spring, in May 2014. I had a 6 month old son at the time. I was 30 years old when they found mine.   If you look through my history, I actually posted photos of the tumor on /r/wtf , It was HUGE.   First thing I will tell you is this, don't panic. The thing about Thyroid Cancer is that is it one of the slowest growing cancers, meaning that she is likely in the very early stages of it. Even with the size of my tumor, and the amount of time it was growing in my neck (my left thyroid had been getting bigger since I was 20 years old) it was still Stage 1A Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma, meaning my surgery, and 1 round of Radiation will likely kill it. I won't know until this August when they do my second scan, if the cells are shrinking in number, I won't have to do another round of radiation, but if they are not, then one more round of radiation. With Thyroid Cancer, unless its over Stage 1A, she won't have to have Chemo. She will take 1 pill, which is filled with radioactive Iodine. The thyroid filters iodine, so it will suck it all up and kill it from the inside. The worst reaction I had to the iodine was my saliva glands swelled up (the went down with Ibuprofen) and I set off a Geiger counter, which was hysterical to me. Other then that I didn't have any other symptoms, my hair stayed in, I wasn't sick or nauseated. But I had to have 0 human contact for 3 days, then another week before I could go anywhere near my son again. I stayed at my mothers house so I wouldn't get him sick. She has ALS so she was like ""Whatever, I'm dying anyways, I don't mind being around you ;)"" Morbid I know, but thats how we are :)  She probably does feel scared and alone. My diagnosis went from my OBGYN saying ""Your thyroid is REALLY enlarged. I'm sending you to an Oncologist."" Oncologist ""Yeah, lets biopsy that."" 1 week later ""The cells are abnormal, we are sending you to a Cancer Specialist."" 3 days later, Cancer Doctor ""Yep, that needs to come out, can we get you in this coming Friday?"" less than 5 days later I had my thyroid removed, and 42 lymph nodes with it, 18 of which the cancer had spread too. A 3 hour surgery turned into a 10 hour surgery. What was supposed to be a 3"" scar was almost a 6"" scar. It's terrifying because it all happened so fast.   Organic Veggies and Juicing won't do anything for her thyroid, though they are yummy :). The best you can do for her right now is listen to her fears, and try to stay positive. It's been over a year since I had mine removed and I am doing 150% better now than ever. She will be on Medication for the rest of her life to regulate her TH levels, but it's a small price to pay to kill cancer.   If she want's someone to chat with she is welcome to PM me on here, I am helping another of my good friends through this too. It sucks to be alone too <3  Here is a link to my cancer photos, FYI it's NSFW really,  but it shows the tumor, and me all drugged up after surgery. http://imgur.com/a/YVc6f"

Also, don't do any of those books about cancer or anything because those just make things worse.

That was my fathers biggest fear that kept him clinging to this world.   I just want to say that You are going to be okay and you need to believe that. Not just for you. (I'm sure this is hard on your son as well.) All of our hearts ache, and that aching will always be a part of how you feel. But it's not your life, and I doubt it's how he would want you to live your life.   When my dad finally passed, and I and my mother had watched him become a shell of himself, there was despair...oh boy there was a ""gnashing of teeth"", as they say. People that haven't gone through that cannot console us. People that have gone through it and lost the focal point of their lives, can support us much more effectively. My mom still sleeps in the chair he died in. She watches their favorite tv shows. She speaks to him when she wants comfort. I still pretend he's near sometimes and tell him about how shitty or good work is going. It's been less than two weeks...now that the funeral is over we can start living as a family again. It's hard and awful, but after so many months and years struggling to cope with his deteriorating condition and its impact on the family, it's freeing that he is no longer suffering. I hope you stay active and talk as much as you need to to stay active and not withdraw. As my dad always said up until his last breath: ""it is what is it is; everything will be okay."" & as I like to say ""everything will be okay in the end; if it is not okay, it is not the end :-) .""   You husband sounds like a wonderful man. He must've thought the world of you and wanted the rest of the world to see what he saw in you. Okay...now I'm getting emotional on the Internet...Hugs, we will both be okay."

My husband went from 190 lbs. to 144 lbs. by the end, but when I picture him now, he's just as I remember him before all this started, which makes it even more difficult. I just really want to hug and kiss him and see his beautiful smile one last time.   Tears are streaming down my face right now. I just feel crushed under the weight of it all. I am so thankful for my son. I'm not sure where I would be without him. Your mom is lucky to have you."

I'm glad you see how fortunate you are to have your son.  I don't have any kids, and I very much wish I did, because I think knowing they needed me would help with the crazy thoughts I have that I don't want to have.  Your son very much needs you and you need him.  Be together as much as you can, it will help. And be prepared for waves of grief.  You will have small moments of joy, or feel yourself smile at your son, and then feel overwhelming moments of sadness. They will come and go. It's totally normal. Eventually the peace will be more often and the sadness less often.  Just keep reminding yourself that you are normal and it's ok.  In any case, you've been in my thoughts all day since I answered you.  Hope you can get some sleep. It will help, even though the waking up part sucks."

cancer,3d1yra,billyvnilly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:12:34 2015 UTC,"The primary cancer is the original site. For instance, a stage 1 breast cancer is confined to the breast. Common secondary sites include the lungs and bone. If you have mets to those areas, you have a much worse prognosis because they cannot surgically resect the tumor. I have never heard of a secondary breast or colon Cancer although I suppose it is possible. If I were to hear bone cancer it is most likely a met but can also be a serious primary cancer that can be hard to treat."

I said with not of...most men who have prostate cancer will not die from it, but usually die from other causes.  It depends on how aggressive it is and how it responds to therapy.  Many patients with prostate cancer will opt for the watch and wait method, where they will not get aggressive therapy for low grade or early prostate cancer, because the cure can be worse than the disease (as your grandpa clearly showed for 8 years, he was better off not getting his prostate removed).  Based on the bone pain and them doing scans, they are looking to see if the cancer has traveled to his bones, in which case it would be stage 4.  Best of luck to your grandpa and your family."

cancer,3d2k21,aggiegirl20,2,Mon Jul 13 00:36:18 2015 UTC,"If your GP dropped the big C on you without being coaxed, that's a sign that they've never seen results like yours before.  That's not anything to be worried about, though. GPs don't see a lot of cancer in people our age, and some tend to panic a bit when results from their under-40 patients aren't completely conclusive. It's always better to be safe than sorry and have it checked out, but your GP could have done a better job of balancing optimism with managing expectations.  You really only have to be worried if the radiologist prompts you to see your doctor about something after taking their images. They know what the doc is looking for from the referral form; unsolicited encouragement to see your doc means they saw something that the doc didn't ask about."
cancer,3d2k21,Lusankya,2,Thu Jul 16 06:01:29 2015 UTC,"Subtle lesions mean they are flat. The doctor is probably checking out on it just to make sure. Your doctor is being thorough, which is a good thing."
cancer,3d2k21,bros402,2,Mon Jul 13 01:14:27 2015 UTC,"Subtle does not mean flat; it usually means ""difficult to see"".   I agree that your GP is probably being thorough, but as u/billyvnilly says, the two are unlikely to be related.   Axillary nodes measuring 14mm with a mastitis (same side I presume) would not be unusual. I would not be surprised if you'd be scheduled for a biopsy and they could not locate it anymore at that time."
cancer,3d2k21,marckemil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:04:08 2015 UTC,"They are 95% likely completely unrelated findings. The cyst you could probably wait 6 months and get an ultrasound or something to see if the cyst got bigger, and just watch it like that.  Your gp is more likely concerned about the adenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes in your armpits).  It would be important to rule out breast cancer and lymphoma; but I wouldn't get too stressed out, mastitis can cause lymph node swelling."

cancer,3d0khr,hellodeeds,2,Sun Jul 12 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"I would say wait for the final pathology and no need to jump ahead before meeting with the medical and radiation oncologist and hearing the plan.  In general, most women do well with breast radiation and are able to work during it. Depending on factors like your mom's age and the pathology, the treatment is usually in the range of 16-33 days, every day Monday to Friday. The treatment is about 15 minutes a day at the cancer center. She would lie on a table, the machine moves around her, and she wouldn't feel anything during the radiation.    Over time however, there are side effects that get worse during the treatment and even for a couple of weeks after the treatment ends. These include fatigue as well as a skin reaction.  The oncologist will help you manage these. The skin may become like a sunburn, red and possibly itchy - most women do well with moisturizing and following the team's instructions but for some it can be like a bad blistering sunburn that needs more care. Sometimes there can be some swelling and tenderness in the breast.  The rad onc will also talk to you about long term changes to the skin and rare long term effects.  You may find more information on a breast cancer specific forum like breastcancer.org where there are a lot more people going through this"

Hmm, its still treated the same way as far as chemo goes for men and women.  They'll test it to see if it expresses estrogen and progesterone and if it HER2 positive.  You'd also want a sentinel lymph node biopsy.   I'd seek other opinions about treatment for sure."
cancer,3d1jvm,billyvnilly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:56:04 2015 UTC,"Glad it sounds like this is early stage. You will also want to ask your doctor about BRCA1/2 testing- in Israel this is readily available as about 1 in 40 folks with Jewish ancestry carry a mutation. Being a male with breast cancer gives you about a 14% chance of having a mutation (higher if you have relatives with breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer).  It could have important implications for you and your family members- for example, once you are finished with your breast cancer treatment, if you carry a BRCA mutation you would be advised to start prostate screening at a much younger than average age. You seem like you are looking for information, so I hope this isn't distressing--rather you can think of it as an opportunity for early detection and prevention!  Best of luck to you!"

Is there a reason you're not taking Avastin?   I would not expect only two rounds of carbo/taxol to make a huge dent. 8 rounds took care of my lung Mets and my nodes.

Laugh and smile when you can and don't be ashamed of letting the other emotions get to you. For us just having a shoulder to cry on helped a lot. We were fortunate enough to have some very good family friends show up and visit with us for a while. I cried on each of their shoulders for a few minutes and forced down some eggs and hash browns that my brother got for me from the cafeteria and we told stories and laughed and smiled and cried a little more.  As a family you'll have to figure out what's important to you and you'll probably second guess every decision. I know I did. These aren't suppose to be easy decisions but discuss them and make them as a family. There aren't words that will make this easier and if you're like me in anyway you don't want it to be easy.  The only thing I might suggest is to get out of the hospital for at least some time. You may want to make sure you don't miss anything. For me, the last five days were so physically and mentally draining I can't imagine how I would have been if I didn't take a couple walks or sleep in my bed at least once. It was refreshing to walk through the park and see some kids laughing and playing. I think it helped me at least.  Remember why you care for your mother. It's nothing as simple as she's the one who gave birth to you. You all have moments that are your own that define ""Mom"" to you and that's what you should hold on to."

cancer,3cxgu0,iLiter4llyCant,7,Sat Jul 11 17:23:49 2015 UTC,"There is no easy way to tell a mother their child has cancer.  We had similar issues with telling my grandmother that I have cancer - sure, mine isn't terminal, but my grandmother is a very... sensitive person (She has attempted to commit suicide multiple times).  I'm assuming your grandmother isn't as... sensitive as mine - but your worry is that the stress of it will be too much for her. You have a few options, but all will cause her stress, no matter what.   Can any of you get in touch with her doctor? If so, I would suggest calling up her doctor, getting the doctor to call you back ASAP, then tell the doctor what is going on, and see if they could provide suggestions for what to do if she reacts adversely to the news (Perhaps some medication could be prescribed, the doctor could keep a closer eye on her, etc.) To break the news to her, I would suggest all of you go and visit her. Block a lot of time out for this - maybe a Saturday or something. If your uncle has any easy-to-understand paperwork, make copies of it for your grandmother, but don't show it to her until after you are done explaining everything. Make sure she is sitting down, and that someone is near her. Then your uncle just needs to break the news - say you have something you need to talk to her about, then your uncle just needs to come out and say it. Be ready for tears. Be ready to have to explain it to her multiple times. She will probably be in shock."
cancer,3cxgu0,bros402,2,Sat Jul 11 17:33:19 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your thoughtful response. I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis as well.   Great idea to get in touch with her doctor. I'll definitely let my mom know. My grandmother isn't particularly sensitive but the problem is she never shows her emotions to our family for fear of making us worry. Like she would hold all of that sadness in to be strong for us which I feel like would make everything worse.   It's definitely not going to be fun. I am also just so scared of essentially having my entire family taken from me. It would just be my mother and I if worse comes to worst. :(
cancer,3cxgu0,bros402,4,Sat Jul 11 17:36:11 2015 UTC,"If she is very stoic - you might want to get pamphlets with information regarding local support groups for people who have family members with cancer. Leave them for her, do not bother her about them, but tell her about the pamphlets. Also give her phone numbers that she can call - there are support lines she can call to have someone to talk to. At her age, it is just unhealthy to bottle up that stress.  Your family will never truly be gone as long as you have the memories. Now is the time to spend a lot of time with your family. If you are interested in family history, ask about their childhoods, learn some cool stories about when your mom/uncle were kids and when your grandmother was growing up. Take a lot of pictures, but not too many - pictures can preserve what someone looks like, but not how the moment feels.  The loss of a family member is never easy to deal with, but the pain... changes over time."

cancer,3cxew9,Missesxhopeless,7,Sat Jul 11 17:07:27 2015 UTC,"Support your mother's decision. This way, she can go out on her own terms, rather than go through months of pain and discomfort to only extend her life by a small amount of time.  Ask her who she wants to talk to - a lawyer, a religious leader, a funeral home director - whatever - but if she wants to cease treatment, the least she can do is get her affairs in order.  Spend all of your time with her. Some people find it comforting to record interactions in their loved one's final days. Others like to ask them stories about their family and childhood, learn things about their family's past that they didn't know before. Some people, after the passing of a family member like to investigate their family history, which is why recording family stories can be so interesting to ask about.  Talk to her, tell her you support her decision, but ask her to explain WHY she doesn't want to proceed with treatment. I would suggest being the middleman between your siblings and your mother. Tell them of her decision, but say that you will only let them visit if they agree not to argue and stress her out.  If she is refusing treatment, see if she can be moved into a hospice - that will be more comfortable for her. If they can, try for home hospice - as she'll be most comfortable at home."

Your mother is trying to control the only thing she can, and that's the time she has remaining. Give her the gift of allowing her that small amount of control.   The prospect of losing a parent at any age is tough. Please know that everyone grieves differently, and as difficult as it is, try not to judge your siblings for how they deal with this. Just because they're significantly older doesn't mean they'll handle it better, or even as well as you.   Best of luck to all of you. I'm stage 4b as well.

I went through the same thing last year when my mom decided she did not want to fight her Pancreatic Cancer anymore after a courageous 3 month battle.  This was very difficult for my brother and I to accept at first.  We did not want for her to give up, we wanted to keep fighting, but we looked at her, down to almost 80 pounds, throwing up 7-10 times a day and realized that keeping her around was selfish and that we should respect her decision.  I think my brother said it best on a blog post of his:     I’ve learned love can often be a selfish thing. We want to love people in the context of how we want it to be. We want to hold on so tight to how we want the relationship to be, how we want the love to be. But, learning to love someone through their own decisions, even if that means deciding to suffer no more, that is truly a higher form of love."

She's 34, diagnosed stage 2b in Dec last year.  The initial chemo/radiation did shrink the tumor but it spread.  She's on palliative chemo now but we're basically in the same time frame as your family.  (4 months to a year with chemo)  Now is not the time for arguments. Now is the time to spend with your Mom, to do the things she wants,  say all the things you need to say to each other. Every person should be allowed to have their wishes respected when dying, even if it is to not forego further treatments. It is hard for her already,  worrying about her family,  but the physical pain she goes through...we cannot understand. I see my baby sister, who was always so strong fighting this battle,  she is fighting to see her only child graduate high school;  after that,  all bets are off.  I hate to see her suffering,  physically & emotionally & all I can do is be there as much as possible. I give her my love & support. If she decides to discontinue treatment,  I would still give her the same & try to save my grief for when we aren't together. Unless we go through the same things as our loved ones, we can't judge their decisions about treatments. Unfortunately, it is their journey & we just have to love & support them until they reach the end.   My thoughts and prayers to your Mom & your family during this difficult time. Be there for each other,  love each other,  make memories."

I second what others have said----this is the time to be with your mom and support her. Forget what your boss has said, you should be with her.   If your mom has made this decision, it's a good idea to start having conversations now about what specifically is important to your mom. Talking with a palliative care specialist and contacting a hospice organization are good places to start because they can help you and your mom think of questions you might not have thought of. Is it important to her to be at home? In her bed? Able to be lucid? In as little pain as possible?   Even though two weeks is a heartbreakingly short amount of time....one thing you do have control over is how you and your mom go through this time.   This is a great article by Dr. Atul Gawande, who has written extensively on how and when to stop pursuing further medical treatment and look ahead to the journey of dying and death.  I'm sorry that your mom, and you and your family, are having to be thrown into this. My mom was also diagnosed with Stage 4B cervical cancer in October 2014 and we're uncertain how much time she has.

It can be caused by a number of things, many can be removed eg h pylori infection. I thunk it's wise to call yr doc Minday with a list of questions to put your mind at ease, or perhaps schedule a visit.  Until then try not to stress (easier said than done!).

Here are a few tips:   keep hydrated, but it doesn't necessarily need to be with water. BEP can make things taste weird and drinking too much water can set your electrolytes off balance. Sports drinks are good and are actually a good way to get you some extra calories if you aren't eating enough. take the antinausea meds regularly. Don't wait until you are nauseous. Also keep in mind that they tend to make you constipated so take miralax and colace to keep you regular. (Also steroids you get make you constipated too) be careful at the end of our cycle to not be around people or environments that can make you sick. You will be immunosuppressed so it really isn't a good time to be going to places where there are lots of people. Wash your hands a lot and make sure the people around you do the same, wear a mask for those few days if you can. Also, BEP patients do NOT need neupogen or neulasta. talk to your medical about how you feel. Anxiety, nausea, anything... Tell them right away because there are ways of making you more comfortable. If something doesn't work, communicate it ASAP.   Hope some of this helps! Please feel free to reach out at any time!"

I couldn't drink plain drinking water cos it tasted metallic. Added a ton of lemon juice.  Take the prophylactic anti-emetics. I didn't have a problem with vomiting because of that.  Know the side effects - the first time I had bleo on its own I cracked a fever and was terrified and it turned out that it's a common side effect of bleo.

Hard candy is good also. For something more substantial, try milkshakes. Keep well hydrated.  -Speak to your doctor in case of nausea or sores, he or she can prescribe something to help with it  -Your immunity will be low so avoid exposure to infection, like going out or being in a dusty environment or eating food prepared outside.  -Carry something to keep you occupied on the day of, like a book or some music  Those are some that I can think of, not sure if they are all applicable for BEP chemo.

cancer,3cvi9i,iamspiffy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:53:54 2015 UTC,"Haven't had BEP but have had one of the drugs in it. Hard candies are good because chemo leaves an awful taste in your mouth. My big mistake my first round was trying to go without nausea medicine after treatment. If you don't feel sick - still take your meds because the nausea will catch up with you, you've gotta stay ahead of it."
cancer,3cvi9i,companycar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:29:06 2015 UTC,"When I was going through BEP the hardest part was the nausea and in all honesty the anti nausea medicine did very little to alleviate it, the only thing that helped for me was marijuana (I know its kinda cliche at this point but seriously it was a miracle drug for me it made me be able to stomach food and alleviated my anxiety of having to go through treatment), so if you can get some and are open to the idea give it a shot.   Another big thing for me was that water tasted horrible, as you know they want you to drink a lot of fluid. Warm water was MUCH more appealing than cold: Tea, or adding lemon juice to warm water, or adding hot water to cranberry and apple juices were how I dealt with the taste problem. That and leaving out ginger ale until it was flat (carbonation = burping = bad) and warm I loved that for some reason too."

cancer,3csgs9,crnth,2,Fri Jul 10 19:29:50 2015 UTC,This is an awesome story. What stage was your dad when he was diagnosed? My father is currently doing folfirinox (what a fucking bitch of a chemo concoction) but your dad's story is so good to read!
cancer,3csgs9,crnth,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:42:49 2015 UTC,"I'm glad my dad's story helped! My dad was Stage III. What the papers call ""Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer."" There was some hint it was in the lymph nodes but mostly it was just really encasing the SMV, SMA, Celiac, and hepatic blood.  Listen, the partial response rate for FOLFIRINOX is already super high - like greater than 40%. But that's assessed radiologically. And there's a paper just published this January from Dr. Lillemoe et al. at Mass General that shows that after FOLFIRINOX, you can't trust radiological imaging to give a clear picture. Often the cancer still looks like cancer but is actually just dead tissue. So the response rate is higher than 40%, probably significantly so.  This is what happened to my dad. Dana Farber wouldn't even operate on him because they thought it was still cancerous after the post-FOLFIRINOX scan. But the folks at MGH opened him up and kept on taking out more and more cancer and it was just all dead. You can't trust the radiology after FOLFIRINOX.  So when your dad is done with the torture, you have to make sure you help him find a doctor who is aware of that. PM me for more details or more contact information. The medical system is going through a revolution over the past six months, literally, in how patients are being treated. The standard of care is changing - make sure you guys are in the new way, not the old!  Wishing you the very best. My dad is going to be released from the hospital tomorrow. He's freakin' cured!!! Yours will be too.   Peace."

Your dad, or who you heard this from, likely misheard... or your doctor is terrible at explaining things.  There are glands called bile ducts, which are a benign part of the liver."
cancer,3cugxy,billyvnilly,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:12:34 2015 UTC,Agree. The only reasonable explanation that comes to mind is that the interventional radiologist passed through a loop of colon on the way to the biopsy site.  Appearance of the cells does not have an impact on the staging. A metastasis is a metastasis regardless of the level of differentiation.

Here (Canada) I usually recommend Glaxal Base. For the damp cloth; ok if it helps, but not for too long. Best to avoid temperature extremes. If it's itchy, cortisone cream 1% can help (ask your radiation oncologist for a prescription) I'm questioning that ""rash"" though. It would be fairly unusual to have radiation dermatitis on the face. Forehead ok, but face... It really depends on the location of the tumor and the technique used, but it may be worth checking with his radiation oncologist. Sometimes chemo will cause rashes as well...

cancer,3cp5zc,spicedmeats,2,Fri Jul 10 03:00:55 2015 UTC,We've seen amazing response rates with pertuzumab it's a standard to give before surgery in our institution (>2 cm tumors) and it should be most everywhere.  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204511703369  This clinical trial is observational not a test of the drug. It looks like it is evaluating PET scan response to this drug to correlate it with pathologic findings. They are not testing the efficacy of the drug which is pretty well established at this point.   Additionally she will need chemotherapy regardless with stage II HER2+ breast cancer. Doing it before the surgery lets your oncologists get a real time survey of the response. If it doesn't respond which they can tell with the surgery she might benefit from additional chemotherapy of a different type. If you do chemo after surgery there's no cancer left to give a sense of this response. The chemotherapy is treating the tumor so its not like doing the surgery is waiting for treatment.  The breast MRI in general will overestimate a tumor size more often than ultrasound but in the setting of lobular cancers which are more infiltrative MRI might be better. It does not mean the tumor grew at all just that they are different tests.  It sounds like you have a lot of remaining questions that the med oncologist should be happy to answer. I definitely think getting a second opinion is more than ok in this setting you and your mom have to be comfortable with her treatment team. It sounds like everything they are doing is proper.
cancer,3cp5zc,Leinna,2,Fri Jul 10 03:07:40 2015 UTC,Make sure they know where the cancer was. If there is a great response and the cancer disappers it can make surgery more difficult; they will probably have put some clips in so they can find it :)

I dont remember there being much pain, though i was well medicated. I was in the hospital for 6 days, but i had a very large incision. I was back to work in a couple weeks. I had the iodine at around the 8 week post op mark. I stayed home and kept to my self in my room, got disposable utensils and gloves. it was only a few days before i could be around people, but you should avoid intimate contact for longer. The nuclear medicine department should advice you pretty well on the guidelines for that one.  One positive note though. I was interviewing for a job a couple months after my treatment, and they asked the question: Whats a difficulty in your life that you went through, and how'd you handle it? Not sure if i scored sympathy when i told them about by cancer issues, but I landed the job."
cancer,3cpaj7,Brendozer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:00:35 2015 UTC,"I was nervous before my thyroidectomy mainly because I have had bad reactions to anesthesia.  I brought this up during my pre-op and the morning of surgery I was provided with an anti-nausea patch to put behind my ear.  It helped very much!  I had great faith in my surgeon's abilities and she explained everything in detail.  I was told I would be going home after surgery unless there was an unexpected complication.  I am a larger person so my surgeon was expecting needing to place a drain, but that wasn't necessary.  After surgery I ended up staying the night because I was extremely out of it.  I think if I didn't live on the third floor (no elevator access) I probably would have gone home.  I don't remember anything in recovery except I was trying to tell the nurse that I wanted my eyes covered because the light was extremely bright.  I also made it known that I don't like to be flat on my back, and my knees were on pillows during recovery.  The littlest things made my recovery much more comfortable.    The morning after surgery I ended up waking up around 4:00 AM.  I was thirsty.  My throat was sore so speaking was difficult.  The difficulty was because my throat was sore from the breathing tube.  Swallowing was painful.  It reminded me of my days of a kid with strep throat.  The throat pain and hoarseness went away after a few days.  I ate mostly soft foods the first day and after that I was good to go.  I was out running around and being myself again 2 days later.  I wore a scarf to wear around my neck for sun protection (and gawkers, I looked kind of gross).  This is what I looked like 1 day after surgery. - warning, dried blood This is me 6 months later.    At my one-week follow-up my surgeon removed that surgical glue and it felt AMAZING.  The glue prevented neck movement and it felt great to be able to move my neck a bit.  Slowly, I returned to sleeping on my side.  My situation was a bit different, my thyroidectomy confirmed cancer.  The pathology report said I had papillary and follicular thyroid cancers that were contained and didn't appear to spread outside the thyroid tissue.  After receiving that news (took about 2 weeks) I followed up with my endocrinologist who explained the steps involved with treatment.      Stopping thyroid hormone  Starting a low-iodine diet for 2 weeks prior to treatment  Blood test to make sure TSH/thyroglobulin levels are where they need to be for treatment to be successful  Taking the radioactive iodine pill and immediately isolating myself from pets and family  Continuing diet for 3 days after taking treatment/Resume thyroid hormones  Post-treatment scan 1 week after taking the radioactive iodine pill   The hardest part for me was not being on thyroid hormone.  I was extremely tired.  The low-iodine diet wasn't difficult, just hard to adjust to since I was used to eating a lot of things that were ""bad.""  After taking the radioactive iodine I was isolated from others for a week.  I took over the master bedroom and bath and since I have two cats, I made a barrier made from a tri-fold foam board supported by plastic hangers.  I placed it so it functioned as a door, but the top part could fold down so I could grab my meals and stuff that were sitting on a TV tray.  Used disposable everything - cups, plates, etc.  Took a shower each day with clean towel each time.  Double-bagged trash and washed all my bedding and clothing at the end.  As far as the ""aftermath"" people look at me and constantly ask questions I find to be stupid.  This one lady felt bad for me because she thought the scar was a result of someone trying to mug me.  Like the other reply said, taking meds each day is a bit of a hassle.  I find that if I don't take them at the same time each day it throws me off and I can feel the tiring effects.  Being female, I was told to avoid becoming pregnant for a year.  In the end, it's a huge pain in the butt but once done, done forever (hopefully).  Very treatable.  I hope you find my story helpful, I wish I read the stories of others to help put me at ease."
cancer,3cpaj7,gravelgrrl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"Happy to answer any questions you have.  Days leading up to the surgery - stressful but not too bad. I was eager to get that fucker out. I'm pretty sensitive to anesthesia so once they gave it to me, I was OUT. Problem was, it took forever for me to wake up. Surgery only lasted about 3-4 hours, but was in the recovery room for longer than that. Afterward, I didn't talk for a week or two since they're right next to your vocal cords during the surgery and I use my voice for my career. Took every extra step to be careful. I put Vitamin E on the scar once I could and always more sunscreen on it before going out. Scar isn't super noticeable now. Spent most of my time after surgery doing crosswords or reading in bed. Couldn't drive or move my head too much since the incisions, stitches, and surgical glue were so fresh.  Had to do RAI. There are different schools of thought and methodologies on this one. Some have you stop your thyroid meds for weeks beforehand and others have you do Thyrogen shots which tricks your body into thinking it's without the hormone. I went for the shots. You get them starting a few days before your RAI treatment. There's also the specialized iodine-free diet to do for the weeks week prior, a well. Make sure you get the cookbook from Thyca.org. It makes prepping for it a whole lot easier and they have no or low-iodine recipes at the ready. My RAI treatment was a month and a half after surgery. Fell right around Thanksgiving, which was a bummer because I couldn't enjoy the typical Thanksgiving foods since it had iodine in everything. Boo on that one.  Had to avoid people for about a week. It all depends on your dosage, but that seems to be the norm. I stayed in my living room and the first thing I did was watch Spaceballs. If you're trapped by yourself and going through cancer treatment, you might as well have a laugh during it.  Other things to note: you're on meds the rest of your life and will always need to have blood tests or scans. While I don't disagree that this is an ""easier"" type of cancer to have because it doesn't involve chemo, it is still cancer and does still turn your entire life upside down. Plans you made and dreams you had are put on hold. But there's an amazing community of survivors here always willing to help or lend an ear."
cancer,3cpaj7,persephone10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:29:45 2015 UTC,"I had a total thyroidectomy and lymph node removal done two weeks ago. I have a huge L shaped scar on my neck now that people tend to stare at. I'm still healing so it's very fresh right now. To get to the lymph nodes they have to cut through a bundle of nerves so the right side of my neck from the incision point up to my jaw and to the middle of my throat is completely numb. It feels like someone has taken a sopping wet cloth and placed it on my neck. I can feel my nerves reconnecting because I get a twinge of pain every once in a while.   For me, the worst part was having the drains in my neck for four days. I was released from the hospital the day after surgery, Friday, and had the drains in until Monday. It was a problem for me because I would almost faint when I had to strip the tubes and clean out the reservoirs. Release the vacuum from the reservoirs before stripping the tubes and the pull inside your neck won't be as bad. Learned that the last day I had them.  Leading up to surgery I was a wreck.  I had only my initial pathology report to go on. But, pathology came back from the surgery and there was no cancer in my lymph nodes, despite the huge 5 cm tumor I had in my neck prior. It's really taken my stress and turned it around. I'm hardly worried about having cancer anymore.  I see my endocrinologist on the 27th then will be having radiation two weeks after that. I will not be allowed to be around humans or animals for five days. Total seclusion. When they give you the radiation they bring it to you in a metal tin and you have to try and take it without touching the pill. It sounds like it's going to be SO SUPER FUN. NOT REALLY. INCONVENIENT.   Taking a pill every day is a small price to pay for cancer. It's been an inconvenience for me more than anything. But I have a pretty badass scar now.  http://imgur.com/SxyPTta This is what it looks like. Still a lot of healing to go!"
cancer,3cpaj7,DeathNeyla,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:10:23 2015 UTC,"I've had it easy. I went in to have one of my parathyroids removed, and during the course of its removal they took a bit of thyroid out and sent it down to the path lab, apparently as a routine thing. The report came back with ""papillary thyroid microcancers"" in two places. The affected lobe and the isthmus were removed; I don't know why they left the other lobe in. Recovery time was a couple of weeks, not because of the thyroid but because of a bad reaction to anaesthesia and one of the shortest, thickest necks the staff had seen in quite a while. Within a month and a half, all tubes were out, all bandages removed, and I was more or less back to normal. No extra iodine, radioactive or otherwise. I am, of course, on a life-long course of thyroid hormone; the endocrinologist has me on 137 mcrograms currently, with the expectation it will jump to 200 micrograms the next time the bloodwork is done, and possible more after that. (She's cautious, thank heavens.)  The scar from the trach tube is about a half-inch wide and maybe an inch long, but it's well hidden by my beard; that's the most serious after-effect.  We are not planning on removing the other lobe; papillary thyroid cancer has the reputation of being an extremely slow grower, the thyroid hormone should help in keeping it from growing much more (by removing any need for the thyroid to actually do anything other than just sit there), and, well, because no-one wants me back in the ICU because my neck went stark-staring bonkers."
cancer,3cpaj7,goodlit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:05:20 2015 UTC,"Days before the surgery were a bit of a blur - packing bags, reading through the literature, making arrangements for someone to look after the house (I was fourteen, school had just ended, the hospital was two hours away, my parents came with me but left my seventeen-year-old sister behind with the dog and the cat and a set of grandparents). I don't remember much except being busy and frightened.  Recovery time is hard to gauge - not sure at what point I felt like I had recovered. I spent ten days in hospital (I had some pretty serious neck dissection at the same time, so they kept me in a while) and the first half of it I spent in a morphine stupor. Some pain and a stiffness for the next couple months. But it was manageable.   I took the iodine about six weeks after surgery. In the meantime, I wasn't allowed any thyroid meds. So I went from feeling okay for post-op to sleeping sixteen hours a day. It was pretty surreal - I was one of those kids who spent five or six hours a day in some sort of physical activity in the summer. And then I became the kid who slept until noon, sat around in a deck chair all afternoon, took a nap before dinner and was in bed by 10:00. I was in isolation in the hospital for four days. I wasn't allowed to spend extended periods immediately adjacent to anyone under eighteen for six months. This was more than twenty years ago, and I understand the parameters have changed some in the meantime.  Two weeks after the iodine, I went into an intensive basketball training camp for a week. I was tired, out of shape and had put on some serious weight while I was waiting for the iodine. I lost most of the weight that week, started to get some energy and my stamina back. So, from surgery and morphine to gruelling physical activity in under two months. Not bad.   I won't lie. The surgery is going to hurt. The radioactive iodine is annoying. And there are lots of weird little problems that go along with surviving this (things that are annoying, but not debilitating). But it's a hell of a lot better than the alternative."

I had BC with rads and reconstruction when I was 32/33. I have the cohesive gel ones (aka ""gummy bears""). The consistency and look of my ""foob"" is very similar to my remaining au natural one. Plastic surgeon did a little work on lefty so it matched the implant. Rads + reconstruction has worse cosmetic outcomes than no rads, but I've been pretty happy-- IRIC, it helps to be young, or something? Nipple/areola reconstruction was so-so for me-- it does the job but doesn't look, like, perfect.  The swap out, surgery-wise, was pretty much a breeze. I was back at work within a week.

At the very least its good news its embryonal and not alveolar.

Until cancer metastasizes to the brain (neurologic changes), some other organ and cause damage, or causes obstruction, it can continue to grow almost unnoticed.  Usually the first symptom a person has is unintentional weight loss.  The fact that it has metastasized (stage IV) doesn't mean anything in regards to her functional status or appearance.  Tiny, tiny, tiny tumors can met and they become stage IV, ...they don't have to be big bulky symptomatic tumors to met.

My high: I am still feeling well and my health stats are rising, had two trips to the beach with wife and kids, and we all went to the circus. Next week we are off to Spain.  My low: my scan was a bit inconclusive because of a recent lung infection. My onc couldn't tell if I was slight progression (lymph node swelling slightly) or it was the infection. I am chronic on targeted meds and have been without signs of cancer the last five months, so they have to look at small signs of inevitable progression.  I am hoping for a year or two before progression so what I fear would be a huge blow..."
cancer,3ckrng,AnonymousCancerGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:14:55 2015 UTC,"No point in scanxiety before vacation because it won't help you at all either way (easier said than done I know). Look at it this way, either way would you choose not to go to Spain? No? Then enjoy the heck out of it! I really enjoy Spain! My advice would be that they don't like people to wear shorts to dinner, and they eat dinner particularly late (like 9pm). When you get back your lung infection will have cleared and they can rescan and you can be ready to face whatever may come with a fresh outlook. Here's hoping for you!"

It's been a rough journey for you and I know I'd feel the same in your shoes so it's hard for me to come up with any advice that seems realistic. Suffice to say I admire you and your journey and everywhere you've been up to now. You are so strong and remember that one of the few advantages to knowing how your journey will end is that you have some say in it. Make arrangements now (as morbid as that sounds) and it might actually make you feel better in the present - less like you have to give up and more like you just need to complete the path you are on. I know you've been working on all that but the sense of being ""finished"" may bring comfort rather than the frustration you are feeling now (because you don't really mean the quitting or you wouldn't be here). Don't hesitate to see a therapist if you want to, and above all else remember that you are an amazing person with a struggle worth telling others about - we benefit from your experience and the people around you do too."

cancer,3clhh1,u6crash,6,Wed Jul 8 20:55:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a radiation oncologist.  Briefly:    Wait for the pathology report.  Grade IV gliomas (glioblastomas - or glioblastoma multiforme - GBM) tend to have a distinct appearance on imaging and are more common. Chemotherapy (temozolomide) with radiation (30 treatments) is currently considered the standard of care for GBM after surgery. Even if 100% of the lesion was removed -- it's just too likely to come back. It's different for other grades. Agree that the breast cancer and the ""brain cancer"" are unlikely to be related. If your mom is able to take her own medical decisions, she should be the one in charge. Having POA is only meaningful if the patient is unable to make their own decisions.   Hope this helps!"
cancer,3clhh1,marckemil,2,Thu Jul 9 02:04:00 2015 UTC,"Pathology has come back as a Grade IV GBM. It does sound as if my father has come around to accepting radiation. I've not heard of anyone that survives long without it. Have done much more reading since. She came home this week and will begin chemo soon.

cancer,3clhh1,bros402,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:16:22 2015 UTC,I would add that the reason additional treatment is needed is that cancer cells spread outside of the visible tumour and so additional treatment is necessary for control.  There are a handful of long term survivors of glioblastoma but there are very few and far between.

I'm not sure the doctors have given her a timeframe yet or if they will until they see how she responds to the treatment.  It's something we can't control so I guess we just hope that she'll be one of those long term outliers and try to brace for the alternative."

Most of it was removed through surgery, but some of it had to be gotten through radiation & chemo. After all of it was gone, they did radiation for a little while longer just to make sure it'd stay gone for a little wihle. Currently, she's cancer free, but recently on an MRI, they detected some odd stuff - they have no idea what it is, but they don't think it is malignant. They're going to operate on her in a few weeks and see what it is.  I would suggest if you want a second opinion, ask your dad to take her to another oncologist just to get a second opinion on treatment."
cancer,3clhh1,spicedmeats,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:17:07 2015 UTC,"Four years ago I was diagnosed with a slow growing brain tumor.  After my surgery, my doctors decided that radiation wasn't necessary.  Less than four months later my tumor was larger than the original and I was back under the knife. I had radiation the second time and haven't had any problems with tumor growth this time. The worst side effects were fatigue, lack of appetite, and a bald spot that never grew back. I had Proton Radiation-it's better because there's no exit energy and saves the other side/healthy brain tissue. It's only in certain places in the country and expensive so Insurance might give you problems but definitely it was definitely worth it."
cancer,3clhh1,spicedmeats,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:12:09 2015 UTC,"I had proton as well - The way it was described for me is that traditional radiation goes in one side and out the other.  Proton radiation behaves more like a waterskiier who has let go of the rope - He skims on the surface with little impact until he loses enough energy, and then drops straight down into the water.  In that way proton drops its energy more precisely at the tumor site, and avoids some of the peripheral damage and side effects (and yes, I can already hear the scientists in the subreddit sharpening their axes at my clumsy and inaccurate depiction, I apologize).  I also had some initial fatigue, and a semi-large bald spot that has kind-of-sort-of grown back in the 5 years since radiation.  I recurred 4 years after treatment, but recurrence really depends upon the type of tumor and how it reacts to a particular treatment, so it really isn't a judgement for or against radiation without knowing the particulars of the tumor in your case.  Look around, ask questions, Get. A.Second. Opinion.  Proton is becoming much more widely available, although you'll still probably have to argue its case with your insurance if its something that interests you.  Edit: on a side note, I fully sympathize with the sentiment of not wanting to trust the internet over your doctor.  However, you do also have to be willing to do your own research and be strong about it.  In my case, we found out about proton from my uncle who worked in a research facility that also did medical treatments, and continued reading online about it.  When we suggested it to my doctors, they literally screamed us out of the office and told us to stop reading stuff online and just trust them.  5 years later, after looking at my results and side effects of the treatment, they told me that I was right to insist on it, that it was a good treatment, and they hoped in another 5-10 years all kids would get proton instead of traditional.  The point being, doctors are human too, and you're not necessarily wrong to do your own looking.  Be respectful and carefully weigh all your choices."
cancer,3clhh1,spicedmeats,3,Fri Jul 10 01:55:56 2015 UTC,That's great everything worked out for you  - the only thing I would caution is proton beam therapy has not been proven superior and in some cases there are definitely uncertainties regarding its equivalency. Photon plans can provide excellent conformality in most cases. Uprooting and living 400 miles away from home while undergoing this treatment for something that is unproven might not be as therapeutic for patient/family.

Eventually, I couldn't tolerate temperature changes of any kind.  I would sweat profusely and panic if it was hotter than 70 degrees and I had to sit in front of an air conditioner nearly all the time.

So it may just be a 2-week baldness you'll need to survive with a hat or scarf, if you choose. My timing was different, and when my hair came back, the wig blew off in the car and I just left it off.

Based on the screenshot, it seems like she is doing alternative therapies in conjunction with the chemo? That is a HUGE problem - alternative therapies frequently decrease the effectiveness of chemotherapy. My oncologist was very open to supplements (i.e. turmeric, soursop tea), but I could only take them after treatment ended because of how they impact the way that your body responds. Is she talking to her oncologist about the alternative treatment?  If her doctor misdiagnosed her and is now saying it is hopeless, I would say that's a really great sign to get another opinion like, yesterday. I understand the pain and anger of misdiagnosis - I was misdiagnosed for 5 years due to my age and the vague, normally benign symptoms that a lymphoma diagnosis often comes with. As a result, I ALWAYS get 2nd and 3rd opinions. I have changed oncologists several times when I don't feel like my concerns are being heard or that I'm being treated in a way that does not make me feel confident."

Unfortunately, being diagnosed at stage 3 meant her cancer had already started to spread, and right from the start she only had a 35% or so chance of survivng five years. Its hard to believe she would ever have been given a 100% all clear... If so then that would be awful. I know in Australia there is a very popular (I'm not saying successful, I'm saying popular) program run by Ian Gawler that focuses on diet (basically vegan), meditation and what not. However, there is no real proof of all that helping, and in fact his own claim of being cured of cancer is in dispute (he had possibly been already cured by amputation of a limb, and what he thought was a recurrence could have been another disease). His ex wife has also set up a rival program, her name is Grace Gawler. Thats all I can add, and I am by no means endorsing it (in other words, I am defintely not recommending it). People with cancer are very vulnerable to scams, I don't think Gawlers are scam artists but nor do I see much evidence that what they do works."

There is no magical alternative cure or therapy out there that actually works.

I know it is hard, especially after already being patient for months. You will get tired, but remember that this is also a test for you.  My father passed away from Stage 4 lung cancer a month ago.

I keep all those moments as a treasure. In the future the moments when you give the most are the ones that will make you most happy andthe moments when you are angry, lazy or selfish are the ones you regret.  Dont worry if the neighboors listen. Make sure that your grandmother is comfortable, not your neighboors. They understand your situation. If they don´t, invite them over.

Unlike my younger brother, I did not always have the best relationship with her but we had gotten over our differences in recent years. Either way, it does not make the process any easier.   The best advice I can give is to enjoy whatever time you have left. Re-live memories of your childhood, take the time to learn about your fathers life story, his childhood etc. No matter what happens, always try to keep the bad memories of the last days at bay. It will be impossible to forget the things you will witness in the coming days and months, but never let them outweigh all of the positive delightful memories you have built."

cancer,3ci99x,nachoqueen,2,Wed Jul 8 11:58:04 2015 UTC,"This is a painful, frustrating, confusing event. For anyone in your position, it is only normal to initially feel alone in this experience. Know that you are not. If you don't feel comfortable discussing your experience and feelings with your friends, reach out to a therapist, like another commenter suggested. Acknowledge the emotions that come to you, positive or negative, and know that you will get through this.  In another thread on this sub, someone referred to a quote that stated, ""Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it."" Make the most of this time with your father. Tell him all the ways in which you appreciate and love him. Share your regrets about your past with him if you haven't already done so. Someone I know lost her mother to Pancreatic Cancer. Before her mother passed, she wrote and voice-recorded her mother's responses to many questions and fill-in-the-blank statements; ""What do you want me to know about being a parent?"", ""What have you learned about love?"", ""What I'll miss most about [cancer fighter's family member] is ___"", ""[cancer fighter's family member] makes me laugh when they _"", ""When you see ______, I want you to think of me"". Of course, these are only some suggestions, and you should ask whatever you'd like to know. As life goes on, you'll have these answers to refer to during milestones, when you're down, or just when you miss your dad.   I hope you find some part of this ramble helpful.   Reddit is a wonderful community, and I know we will continue to support you through your journey. Don't hesitate to reach out again, whenever!"
cancer,3ci99x,meeshao,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:12:59 2015 UTC,"I'm totally in the same boat as you.  I just found out a couple weeks ago that my dad has small cell lung cancer, and has had for about 3 years.  I think he said that without chemo, it would be 6 mo - 1 year, but he's starting chemo next Friday.  He's quit smoking earlier this year, but he's 64 and has smoked since he was probably 10 years old.  I'm at a loss for what to do, too.  My dad also lives far away, prohibitively far for me to go visit him.  I can't be there for him, or take him to the hospital, or do much to help him.  I'm going to make him a little care package of things like puzzle books, a warm hat, hard candies, and some anbesol (cause chemo gives you mouth sores?).  I really wish I could be there, or he could be here.  I don't know what I'm going to do if he doesn't make it through since I can't go see him."
cancer,3cgo0s,TheDesiBoy,6,Tue Jul 7 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"I am a bit confused by this.  If you chemotherapy kills your hair, why shampoo it?  If the hair loss is due to a drug targeting mitosis, I am not sure how shampoo would save the dividing hair cells."
cancer,3cgo0s,JacketKeeper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:32:27 2015 UTC,"That's a good question! Even though chemotherapy patients are in the process of losing their hair, their scalp is still really sensitive (and some still have some hair as well). The product my team is planning to create is a shampoo that soothes the sensitivity in the scalp. Our product is to make life during chemotherapy as bearable as possible, because those undergoing chemo already are burdened enough."
cancer,3cgo0s,Zombiikins,3,Tue Jul 7 22:49:43 2015 UTC,"I think their point was that, at least with my mom, when the hair loss started, she simply shaved it off.  This is a pleasant idea, but I would say consider something other than shampoo since there is hair loss and skin irritation in happens all over, not just on the scalp. If hair care is something you want to do, consider an oil instead since that can transfer yo being used on scalp as well as the rest of the body. Skin irritation isn't limited to just that area."
cancer,3cgo0s,gothelder,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:53:42 2015 UTC,I think that is a valid point you bring up.

cancer,3cgo0s,adenocarcinoma,2,Tue Jul 7 22:58:27 2015 UTC,My problem was scalp sensitivity and burning from sun exposure.  If you're talking about some kind of lotion-shampoo with SPF and something for the sensitivity... you'd have a winner.

I do get scalp sensitivity though, but I just use the same scent-free color-free moisturizing bodywash I use on the rest of myself to help with it.

cancer,3cfhwf,Gummybearland,10,Tue Jul 7 14:42:16 2015 UTC,"I'll say the following as I would want my wife (of 4 weeks or 4 decades) to treat me, having had lymphoma myself and dealt with a sometimes overwhelming amount of ""support"" (read: pity) from family members, friends and my then girlfriend:   I don't want your pity or for you to feel sorry for me; I want you to admire my strength and resolve in fighting this battle. I don't want to be treated like a child; I want you to treat me like the strong, grown man that I am. I DO want you to ask me, occasionally, how I'm doing... like how am I really doing. And then just listen. Other times, ask specific questions (feel this one out, but personally I liked it when people would ask me specific questions, especially if it meant I got to show off how strong I was). I may not have an answer right away. Sometimes I may not want to answer it right then. But I will appreciate you asking (again, it's important to figure out what the right frequency is to ask, for me it would be like once a month). I want you to focus on your work and not worry so much about me... because that's a heavy burden for me to carry. (I spent so much constant effort consoling other people about how I'd be alright... weren't they the ones supposed to console me?! lol) I know this hurts you. I know this worries you. I know this scares you. I know (especially in your case with your health issues) that this may affect you much stronger than it normally would. I'll try to help you too. Just because I don't share my feelings all the time doesn't mean I'm hiding things from you. It doesn't mean I'm not ""processing things"". It may just mean that I just am not worried. Or that I have overcome it.   That's already a wall of text... I could keep going and would be happy to do so but will stop there for now.

I guess a more specific question I might have is, because of my health issues my first instinct is to force feed him a super clean no sugar or grains diet. I have been on a strict diet and am used to it, and I know I would do it myself. Would that be too much at this time? I am feeding him the best I can but he likes his granola and a few sugary snacks, and I just wanting him eating the rainbow and clean protein. I don't want to stress him out because I am sure he wants a little comfort food now, but I feel like this would help me worry less. What do you think?"
cancer,3cfhwf,wbravo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:49:41 2015 UTC,"Wow I just checked my reddit... I'm so happy you found it helpful!! It's obviously something I've given a lot of thought to but don't really get to talk to anyone about.  Regarding diet... heh, yea, I also tried to go super clean... but I realized the main thing is that I maintain weight (chemo can sometimes do nothing; sometimes make you lose tons of weight).  And at the end of the day it's like pulling out your umbrella after a nuclear explosion. The chemo is going to absolutely wreck his body and there's not much that diet can do. The cancer isn't going to go away because he doesn't eat sugar. It's going to go away because the chemo is going to blast it to pieces.  Eating healthy will still give him the same benefits as it would anyone but it's not going have an appreciable effect on his recovery.  So... to make a long story short I'm just trying to say not to worry much about his diet. Don't tell him he ""can't eat this or that."" He's already so little he has control over, that his diet may be something he clings to. Cook healthy food for him when you can, but let him pig out when he wants to. It'll be easier on the both of you."

She's way more distant than we were before this all happend 6 weeks ago...  Somehow I feel like I should be there for her but on the other hand I fully understand the 'not focussing too much on her' part. I'm a wreck because of hearing so little of her but when I do she seems alright. She just doesn't want to talk a lot or be on the phone a lot and it's not always easy to comprehend. Especially because she says she's bored a lot at home. But she doesn't want me (or anyone else for that matter) to come over. Which is hard to take when all you've done for over a year is hear and see each other all the time. Your reply makes it a little easier to understand.  I wish there was more I could do for her.

Save your crying for the full moon, maybe one day you won't feel like crying anymore. Xxx"

cancer,3cc33c,Pugzy2011,3,Tue Jul 7 21:03:38 2015 UTC,"This will be one of the hardest years of your life.  Do yourself a favor and express any emotion that bubbles up within you.  There is no wrong way to grieve.    Know that myself and others on this sub have stood exactly where you have on losing someone like this.  If you need to talk or vent, feel free to PM me."
cancer,3cc6d6,tcslsp,2,Mon Jul 6 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to hear the situation you're in, cancer is so evil. In the last 4 years I've lost my Nan (who was like my best friend too, they're awesome at that!) and 2 years later my lovely Mum who was only in her 50s.  I can also relate to crappy family not being bothered, it still saddens me now that mine were the way the were. The only advice, well more experience I can share is: make the most of the time you have with her - however long that may be. She'll be upset about the rest of your family but she'll also be so grateful you're there. Ask all the questions you can ever think you'd want to, share memories and laugh together. When times are hard and she's having bad days use any positive times you had together to keep her going.  I can't say much that will alleviate any of the pain you're going through now or later. There is the other side, when they're gone and you can get through even if you can't see it. Get a good support group around yourself. I'm lucky I've got awesome friends, they've been my lifeline.  Wishing you all the best."

cancer,3cbhdn,sho3,3,Mon Jul 6 16:46:21 2015 UTC,"As someone who lost their mom to Pancreatic Cancer, the best thing you can do is be there for your wife, be her shoulder to cry on, be her punching bag when the anger she will feel comes up (this one is very difficult for someone to deal with), help her with minuscule tasks around the house that she might normally take care of.  Take the burden of those chores off her shoulders for a while.  The absolute last thing I wanted to deal with when I was about to lose my mom and for the weeks after was the day to day tasks that life requires (laundry, cleaning, etc).    As your wife's biggest supporter, you need to be 100% selfless right now.  This is incredibly difficult for most people.  You have to put your needs/wants/desires aside for a period of time and give yourself unconditionally to your wife.  Let me give you an example... my wife could not grasp the concept of selflessness... she literally got furious with me about not getting her the ice cream cake she wanted for her birthday a mere 8 days after I found out my mom was diagnosed.  Guess what?  3 months later my mom was gone, there are no more birthdays of hers to celebrate, while my wife will get another bday.  It's been almost a year and I still have not been able to forgive my wife for this selfishness (and others during the battle) in my biggest time of need."
cancer,3cbhdn,budsw27,3,Mon Jul 6 16:57:40 2015 UTC,"I will also add this... even though you are probably on the sidelines for this battle, you might want to figure out a way to discuss with your wife if Chemo is truly the best way to go given the doctors prognosis.  I can tell you from experience, that while Chemo may extend a life, it will make that persons quality of life deteriorate rapidly.  The Chemo basically killed my mom, her body could not handle it and she spent 3 months suffering through the side effects.  Of course hindsight is 20/20, but we often wonder in my family what would have happened if we had just let her be, would she have suffered as much?  We will never know, but it weighs heavily on our hearts."

cancer,3cbhdn,bros402,2,Mon Jul 6 19:15:37 2015 UTC,"I just went through something similar and tragic a few weeks ago. In my case it was a good friend of my daughters. He was Dx 2 years ago and passed away about 3 weeks ago. Based on my conversations with his mom:  -be there for her obviously and validate whatever it is she is feeling  -she will be burdened by the knowledge that she is losing her mother, do all you can do to relieve her of any other burdens that she does not have to carry right now-lighten her heavy load as much as you can.  -If she is a person of faith (my daughters friends are) do not ever give up, if you pray then do it without ceasing. As a Christian for his mom this was one of the most important aspects. She felt even more sad and heavy hearted when, after the year or so of treatment, her friends that are of faith gave it up. I could probably write a book about this but I think you are looking for some concise advice right now so I will refrain   Unless you truly have already been through this yourself, I mean lost a parent, please please refrain from saying anything like ""I know how you feel""... If you haven't lost a parent then you do not know how it feels and you can't compare it to anything. In those times when I know how you feel seems like a response you want to give put that thought on hold, hold her hand and tell her how sorry you are that this is happening instead"
cancer,3cbhdn,ThrowawayEOL,2,Mon Jul 6 17:56:58 2015 UTC,"When my mom lost her father (my grandfather) 10 years ago, it was very difficult for her. Your wife will be depressed and angry for a while. Ask her what she wants to do. If it's time to eat and she doesn't really respond, get her some food that is comforting to her. See if her mom can give you some of your wife's favorite recipes - practice making them, it might help your wife out. Everyone handles grief differently. You need to be strong during this time. Be ready to take some time off work just to help your wife find her bearings again."

For quite a awhile afterwards he will need some help. Maybe not need but it definetly is nice hehe. Someone to make your food & get you water. In my case, I was just INSANELY exhausted for months after the precedure. Going down my 5 stairs to get to my refridgerator to get a cold glass of water felt like a forced death march. It really takes awhile to buld up your willpower. Everything is tiresome. Walking to your car & going  to the appointments 3x a week was dreadful, just because I was that tired. I only wanted to sleep. He will most likely be in a wheelchair when going back and forth in the hospital. Until slowly u build up enough stamina to walk that far. He may need help getting dressed after showers or just tell him to be extra careful. I was 32 when I did mine & afterwards balancing on one leg to put on pants or socks was impossible for me. I had like.. newborn calf legs lol. Also your taste buds are gonna be basically completely gone. So your mouth is completely dry. Which makes developing an appetite troublesome.

BUT, lucky me mine turned out to be ""refractory"" Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, which means its chemo resistant. So i was completely finished with my initial rounds of chemotherapy (8 sessions of R-CHOP) before they found out the mass in my intestine didnt shrink with the chemo. Then they tried a different chemo ( I forget what was  called) for 2 sessions & found not only was the mass they were trying to shrink not gone, it had doubled in size.

I'm talking about grants upwards of $10k. Have you looked into resources like that at his treatment center/hospital or spoke to his doctor?
cancer,3c6l8e,maybethistimeiwin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:45:36 2015 UTC,"Well the problem is that he lives outside of the u.s. he has medical Insurance, good enough for him to fly state side and get good care. The living situation is what is worrying us. We need to get a furnished apartment, a nurse, and a maid to cook and clean. In the country where he resides all of this costs about 1300 a month. I don't think grants cover these kinds of expenditures."

cancer,3c20wr,Puny-Earthling,9,Sat Jul 4 00:59:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, for blood work - ask the doctors for lidocaine-prilocaine cream, which is also known as Emla. I have a phobia of needles. This numbs the arms. Apply about 20 minutes before and it works like a charm. Other things to do: 1. Squeeze the hand of someone when it hurts. 2. NEVER LOOK AT THE ARM 3. Look at something - I like to look at the wallpaper, or bring a piece of paper with something to count to look at.  Try talking to the oncologist and see if they can get in touch with Owen O'Connor at Columbia University's Center for Lymphoid Malignancies in New York City. He is one of the world experts in Lymphoid Malignancies and deals with rare lymphoid malignancies all the time."
cancer,3c20wr,bros402,3,Sat Jul 4 01:27:19 2015 UTC,We have tried all of methods. The latest was a ton of valium and a penthrone whistle but it didn't work and she ended up kicking the nurse hyperventilating and in tears. Our Gp has suggested to dose her with ketamine and do what needs to be done.  Thanks for the info on Dr o'Connor. We are in Sydney Australia but I might try sending the university an email and see if he can pass on some of his research notes to our haematologist.

cancer,3c20wr,Michelle0522,2,Sat Jul 4 20:08:23 2015 UTC,In regards to possible treatment for her rare cancer I highly recommend that you look into Rational Therapeutics. They work with your oncologist to determine the best course of treatment by analyzing her tumor in a laboratory. This chemosensitivity assay tests her individual tumor amongst several chemo therapies and other targeted agents  to see what it responds to.   I have an extremely rare cancer as well and had my tumor sent to their laboratory after several therapies failed to work in the past leaving me out of options. It turned out that my cancer was sensitive to a drug used to treat a different kind of cancer and I never would have found out about it unless I had done this test. I am currently taking the new drug and doing great so far. I credit the doctor for possibly saving my life and hope he can help her as well.

This is a really bad part of the diagnosis, the waiting and wondering and fearing. When you get more info and a plan, hopefully you will feel more calm and focused, though you'll still have scary and sad days.  I would always recommend at least two opinions, and go wherever you possibly can that has experts. It's so worth it to get the best advice and plan possible, even if the effort of doing that right now is tough.   In my experience, when/if she gets a CVC (central venous catheter) they can potentially draw blood through that. Maybe even if it's a port, but I'm not sure about that. Then she won't be having to get pricked near as often."

Pain  Painkillers or toughing it out.I did not hurt much most days though,the veins that were used to put chemo in my body were mostly the ones that gave me trouble.Occasionally my arm bones would hurt.  I suggest you talk with your doctor.There are options out there for the relief of patients that undergo chemo  Also try to keep yourself occupied.I played video games and surfed the internet (I kept myself at home to avoid getting infected while  my white blood cells were down.).They do help to take your mind of your damaged body."

She sleeps a lot for a few days after chemo, like almost all the time.    Emotionally, she is on antidepressants,  visits from friends & family help (I hope). She was very active socially before she got sick.  Her boss/pastor visits & talks with her often,  he's a good, kind man. She drinks a lot of fluids, peppermint tea, juices, lemonade & water to help the chemo drugs get through her system. She keeps fighting.  She wants to live even in spite of this excruciating pain.  She continues on for her husband & son, knowing we don't have a lot of time left.  She wants to see her son graduate high school, so she's holding on.

Maybe (and hopefully) this is temporary, I don't know.      Family has never been the most supportive thing in my life either. For instance, one of my siblings reaction to my chemo was rather schadenfreuderic (doesn't seem to care & seem to think ""good thing it isn't me who's experiencing this"" & just move on as if nothing is happening).

It's tough, there is no doubt about that. There were lots of times when I was finally feeling almost okay after a round of chemo and could hardly face the fact that the next round was only a day or two away.

She said when she went through it she felt terrible but didn't say anything because she thought she was supposed to feel terrible! By the time she was in full misery the doctor scolded her, saying she does not have to feel miserable and there are many drugs out there that can help to alleviate the side effects.  Don't be afraid to speak up for yourself!  It sounds like you might benefit from someone to talk to, if that is your thing.  There is a company called Cancer Care and they offer free counseling sessions to cancer patients.  You can go to their office if you live near a center or they are also available for one-on-one phone sessions.  For me, it has been helpful but I know that every person is different.

Everybody seems to react differently so are you having problems with bloating/nausea/diarrhea/fatigue?  It sounds mostly like depression to which the BEST thing that helped me was reading in the sun with my kitty by me in the grass. I would read CSLewis' The Problem of Pain (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!) and Mere Christianity. My Bible. Lord of The Rings, Wheel of Time series. But when the body was zombified for 6 days after ABVD just about the only thing I could do was get a little bit of grape juice and a saltine or two in me and watch hours and hours of Anthony Bourdains No Reservations imaging a time when I would be able to view some of those places."
cancer,3c2zl8,daelite,2,Sat Jul 4 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"Aside from ""standard"" physical side effects (I get nausea, bloating, fatigue & dizziness primarily), there's this extreme discomfort inside my whole body (like it's telling me something is terribly wrong with my body thanks to the chemo meds, and like my body could break down/blow up any moment -- very hard to describe, maybe those who had been on the same road can help me describe this). Haven't been able to well explain this latter sensation to my doctor either. :(     Thanks for your suggestions, will try to look into some of those books & see if they could be inspirational for me."
cancer,3c2zl8,Luke_Emiya,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:59:24 2015 UTC,"That exploding/break down feeling sounds pretty awful. I can't say as though I had similar - or maybe I did and our descriptive terms differ. I would go in for ABVD every other week; after they dropped the first red bag of Adriomycin I went zombie for about 6-8 days.  Similar physical symptoms but not really nausea. I wouldn't say blow up, but definitely felt like my whole body was going to disintegrate. I don't know if you're religious at all, but it very much felt like at times there was this external feeling of being duct taped together so I didn't fall apart and I always felt like that was God helping me.  Anyway, one of the ways that really really helped me with my stomach/bloating/distention/pseudo-nausea was heating peppermint essential oil. I had one of those things that burns a candle underneath a small dish of the oil and that had an AMAZING effect on calming things down so I could sleep, which in turn sped up recovery. I highly recommend that as well as ativan. They never told me about ativan before and phenergan and zofran didn't do anything for me. You mentioned that you had some good luck with marinol (lucky you! my experience was a crapshoot) but you might also have good luck putting ativan under your tongue before you do zofran. Just another tip, if marinol helps and gets you eating maybe stick with it.   Another GREAT trick is using heat pads to place over your stomach. This is more a nausea thing but it helps a LOT. Also if you have constipation at all my go to helpers were 2 tabs of senna the night before chemo, 2 the morning of, and 2 the day after.  Senna will promote motility and make you have to poo but I found if I could putt the concrete that formed in my guts after chemo I would recover faster. It's like it all went straight to my colon and the longer it fermented in there the harder it was to recover. Also Colase is a little red pill that only softens your stool without promoting motility (making you have to poo more often). He can help too especially if the chemo makes concrete poo like it did for me (it's painful and dangerous to have an anal fissure while going through chemo).  Ativan I've found helps relax my mind/body/nerves and has helped morphine be more effective as well as zofran so it might be something that would help not only calm your anxiety about the treatment itself but let the meds you are trying work more effectively. Be warned though you can become addicted to it (not real bad just so long as you know it's possible and you know your using it is just short term till you get rid of this cancer.)  Lemme know how things go if you get a chance. I know it can be hard , especially when it seems other people seem to go through their chemo experiences a lot easier than it sounds like you or I do. But everyone is different. There's a way through this. I'm sorry about your family not being more there for you, but I am if you need me. :D   Stranger hug :D"

Also, how to mentally deal with relapse or a second primary cancer.    Different types of coping mechanisms.    How to talk to a cancer patient - stressing that there is no one right thing to say.    Care package ideas for people that want to support their friends.    Tips and tricks to deal with chemo/radiation (e.g. hard candy, G2 Gatorade,  aquaphor, etc).    Cancer nutrition information and tips and tricks to maintain health/weight. Also links to supplements information - that most don't work and some may be harmful depending on your chemo (e.g. St Johns wort and certain drugs).    Side effects to watch out for (ones that warrant contacting a professional for an opinion/going to the ER - e.g. easy bruising or fevers > 100.4 or an injection site becoming red/painful)     I think this would be a great crash course for people. I see many people turn to Reddit first instead of the ACS for their information (and I always try my best to point them to the proper ACS links), and I think all the topics in this thread could be a very beneficial compendium for so many. Thank you for doing this."
cancer,3bzzb4,pointywalrus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:31:59 2015 UTC,But of course! The only one of these I hesitate on is to make recommendations about interactions - and as such supplement info. The policy at our clinic for instance is if we don't give it to you then you don't take it. Period. For the most part it creates expensive urine but on the other hand some have chemo interactions and some studies have shown that antioxidants hurt the effectiveness of radiation (which works by creating free radicals to damage DNA) but I digress. I love the rest of the suggestions and I will work on making a cohesive series which involves all of these too!
cancer,3bzzb4,Leinna,2,Sat Jul 4 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that supplements are bunk. And like I said, they do have interactions potentially (e.g. st john's wort). But I think it's important to include because of the homeopathy and nature medicine movement that is so vocal and prevalent. I've had so many tell me to take this and that and tumeric and ginger and on and on because they think it works, and they think they're helping. They hear this information from the vocal homeopathy minority and never bother to research the claims themselves. And the reality is that most supplements do nothing for cancer. That's why I think the big ones - cannabis oil, tumeric, Burzynski clinic should be included under a ""caveat emptor"" supplement heading."
cancer,3bzzb4,bellasarah,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"Sure I can certainly include a section like that.

I sometimes it is very easy to get wrapped up in the first stages of having a diagnosis and going through treatment but a lot of cancer patients struggle with the long term emotional side-effects of being a cancer survivor.   Additionally, I think it would be awesome (though maybe difficult) to have some specific male/female stuff because I think there are things that effect men and women differently (like fertility preservation, dryness, etc). But I think it might be hard to compile this/make it PC.  I wish that I had more time on my hands because I would really love to start something for the young adults out there with cancer because (while Stupid Cancer) is great, I really feel something is missing. But I think your series would be a really awesome start. I think you could post it to the side of this sub so that people visiting r/cancer could go there first for resources would also be extremely helpful."

My mom and I switched positions at the hospital so she can rest so i stayed with her all day for days on end. When my mom returned the doctor said me being with her made her platelets go up, and maybe its just a theory of mine but making someone happy really does affect the body.

He could decline quickly, or he could try to last a little bit longer, but he is 90. He has had a nice, long life. I would talk to him, see what he wants to do and how he wants to spend his time left.

cancer,3bwdio,Leinna,3,Thu Jul 2 20:09:11 2015 UTC,"Often giving chemotherapy to 90 year olds is worse than the cancer itself, so that's probably why it's not on offer.  ""Liver and lung cancer"" could be lung cancer that has spread to the liver, liver cancer that has spread to the lung, or bowel cancer that has spread to both sites, or something else entirely.  The outlook depends a little on what type of cancer it is.  Doctors can only give estimates; we might know that someone with a particular stage of cancer has an average life expectancy of 3 months, but some people go sooner and some people live longer.  Generally when you are older the body doesn't have as much reserve so things may be quicker than average.  However some older people get cancers that are fairly lazy and don't grow very quickly.  In summary, hard to know, spend what time you can."

I'm not going to tell you it's pleasant, but I will say that it makes me feel better. When I'm on chemo, I have a horrible day (8 hours of poison) followed by two really shitty days (2 days of a pump) followed by 3-4 days of being goddamn miserable (side effects of 3 straight days of poison), but then I get a week of feeling mostly normal, or at least close to it. When I'm on chemo, every other week is mine to do with as I please.   I've taken a few breaks from chemo over the 2 1/2 years that I've been doing it. It's nice for a couple weeks. Then something goes wrong. It doesn't get better. Then something else goes wrong. Then I end up in the hospital for something stupid. After the residual effects of the chemo wear off, every day is a bad day, and every day gets worse.  It's at least worth a shot. My chemo is 100% palliative, no curative intent whatsoever, yet I'm more than happy to continue it. It's not even really working...my numbers aren't going up as fast as they do off of chemo, but they surely aren't going down. It makes me feel better, which is the whole point. It's also extending my life, as an bonus side effect.  I'd encourage her to at least give it a shot. If it's too much to handle, at least then she knows and doesn't have to deal with the what-ifs."
cancer,3bucws,adenocarcinoma,3,Thu Jul 2 10:28:36 2015 UTC,"This really depends on the type of chemo your Mom gets. For me, chemo was the horrible monster. There are many different types of chemo.

The first thing I was wondering is: would the treatment be curative? This means: will the treatment have the goal to cure?   Also, what I am thinking: she can always start treatment and if she sees that the side effects of chemo (or whatever it is) are too rough she can stop it later. But then, she would make an informed decision."

cancer,3btm77,MJPana1550,5,Thu Jul 2 01:21:15 2015 UTC,"This is a very scary time where there is a lot to take in, and you and those close to you will have lots of questions and concerns, naturally. You are definitely not alone, and even in the huge community of other cancer fighters and survivors, there are a lot of understandable fears. Write down any questions and concerns and bring them to both consultations with your radiologist as well as your oncologist, and any nurses. You'll meet a lot of new faces, but rest assured they'll be a valued part of your butt kicking team.   My dad is in week two of treatment for stage 2-3 rectal cancer, so your treatment plan may not be the same. He's got five weeks of radiation five days a week as well as a PICC line to deliver chemo 24/7 during that time, to be refilled once a week. We have private insurance that covers chemo pills which may be more convenient but elevated kidney levels forced us to get the bottle of chemo. They check on you often - we do blood work at least once a week and meet with both doctors once a week. After the five weeks, he'll have to have a recovery period before surgery at which point they'll remove the tumour and give him a colostomy bag.   The scariest things for us are the side effects of chemo and adapting to life after surgery. So far, he has been free of side effects but it's very early. I've loaded up with suggested over the counter items like anti diarrhoea pills, soft flushable baby wipes, meal replacement shakes, moisturizing cream in case of dry hands and feet, sunscreen, lemon and ginger candies, pedialyte, and he's got a prescription for anti nausea pills. There's a homemade mix to rinse your mouth to prevent mouth sores too.   Let your support system help. For your sanity and theirs! The more you learn about your own care plan, the less you'll think about the things that scare you and the more everyone will be focused on that goal of treating you. Best of luck!"

I'll be sure to stock up on those items in time for my treatment and double check the options for the chemo since my insurance seems to be pretty lenient about all the different methods.  Best of luck to your father and his treatment, it sounds like he's in good hands with the doctors and yourself (and of course everyone else left unmentioned). :)"
cancer,3btm77,tnova,4,Thu Jul 2 13:59:55 2015 UTC,"I don't have the same type of cancer as you, but in my experience so far that first week after the diagnosis is the absolute worst.  The fear of the unkown, not having all the facts, and worst of all the feeling that you know you need treatment but haven't started yet.  The side effects of chemo suck really bad, but at least you know that something is being done to fight back.  If you don't want to put on a positive face all day, then don't.  Express your emotions, the way you're really feeling, to people that you can trust.  Some people think that cancer is a ""mind over matter"" disease, and that if you just stay positive you'll get better.  This is why a lot of people are afraid to see a cancer patient be sad or angry. The fact is that positivity won't rid you of cancer - chemo, radiation, and surgery will.  Let it all out, and then when you really do feel happy or positive it won't feel fake anymore.  PS: if you're having trouble sleeping at night try melatonin"

I'll definitely be in touch.  I'm starting to wonder (based on a relatively uneducated guess) how my treatment will go.  My GI doctor mentioned a 20 day regiment of local chemo-radiation at the same time.  I don't know if that is what will actually happen or if that is relatively standard for a first approach.

Everyone feels the effects slightly different but the best way to keep your high under control is to take it slow, especially with edibles. These are the ones that creep up on you like no other.   Eat a little piece and wait as long as it takes for you to notice your high, ride it out and then as you start to come down, gauge yourself on your goal. Did it make you hungry enough without too much anxiety, were you too anxious and not hungry at all? These types of questions will help you determine the best way to use your medicine."

If you have a legit dealer and you're not getting schwag, ask if they can get weed high in CBD and low in THC.  THC is what gives you the high effect, but it also is what induces the anxious feeling you get.  CBD does not create the high, which is great for medicinal purposes, and actually does relieve anxiety.    I also recommend getting a legitimate vaporizer (either desktop or a good glass-chambered portable one) if you're eventually going to end up smoking it."

I'll keep this as short as possible.   DO NOT INGEST ANY MARIJUANA UNTIL DAY +100.   Ya. No seriously. We have no immune systems thanks to the transplants and chemo. You'll have to wear a mask just to go outside for the first 30 days even. If fucking sucks. Trust me. But one bad spore in the air or some kind of typically harmless spore of fungus in the weed could land you in the hospital for weeks. I saw it happen to a guy last week who ate it. The treatment for it looks awful too as they basically liquid flush your airways.   After 100 days I say go ahead and try it. Make sure its quality weed though. It has absolutely helped me through this process.   Edit: Your magical middle ground exists partially in a drug called Marinol. Its a synthetic THC pill that pretty much gives you the munchies and helps me at least with anxiety. You CAN get high off it though. I've only experienced it once and it was like 2 hours after taking it but it wasnt nearly as intense as smoking.

If you can get a weed card and go to a dispensary, they would be able to help you find a strain that works well without upping anxiety.   I didn't indulge at all before I got sick. I think I maybe tried it once? But marijuana in either vaporized or edible forms have been the difference between taking a handful of sleep, pain, and anxiety pills every day and being functional enough to continue working full time through treatment.  Make sure you talk to your oncologist. Mine was very on board with my marijuana usage and gave me solid advice (and as an edging on 80 year old chief of oncology, totally didn't expect his response!)."
cancer,3bstdj,BloopityBleepBleep,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:57:07 2015 UTC,"I swear by it, it really stops my nausea and helps with the muscle pain that is a side effect of my chemo. But.... I have always enjoyed marijuana.  Start off really small, like half recommended dose, a quarter even and 45 minutes to an hour after you've taken it, document how you feel.   If it feels bad, I think that's your body telling you not to take it. There's no proven cancer fighting benefit to marijuana, it's use is solely to help you feel better. If it doesn't make you feel better don't take it (as opposed to say chemo which we do tolerate bad side effects of because it does shrink tumours).   Anyway, your post is 3 days ago, so presumably yo've conducted your experiment, i hope it went well, because for those of us who it does work for, it's really great to lift the pain and nausea.  Also as another poster has mentioned, a vapouriser is a good way to go - you get to titrate the dose more effectively than you can with eating because it affectsyou immediately. My recommendation for a new imbiber is a Magic Flight Launch Box, it's one of the cheaper ones but works well, if you decide you like it you may want to upgrade to the more expensive super duper ones (I use Arizer Solo and the Storz and Bickel Plenty, but these are pricey, you want to be a really committed pot head to pay that much IMO), but for beginners MFLB is effective, well made and crucially, not expensive."

That being said imo as someone who works in the field I think your family had the right idea. Try googling some statistics on his stage/cell type and compare people's quality of life as the end approaches. If he has a chance to do something lovely while he still feels well then he should be encouraged to do so! Time is precious.

Also, my rectum was in the radiated field which lead to weird sensations during the same days.   I had radiation because of the pain the tumor caused in this area.

You can expect a week or two before you start seeing symptoms (tight muscles chest/arms, tingling/filling sensation which can be painful, sensitive skin, fatigue) and these will continue to worsen for several weeks after xrt. This area should always be clean and dry for treatment even if they give you creams for the skin (otherwise they can act like suntan lotion) and you will need to protect the treatment area from the sun for the rest of your life.   Let me know if I can be of further assistance!   Edit: as for your mom radiation is a scary word, most people are upset by their ""ideas"" about it.

cancer,3bnpxj,Inorai,3,Tue Jun 30 18:52:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on your kind of cancer and how aggressive it was behaving. In all honesty it's likely there will be some form of additional monitoring until they see if it's stable. Some hospitals or groups have programs to help defray costs associated with these tests; right now, just keep your mind on target.  It's also a possibility that they would do an mri or ct scan instead of the more expensive full body.  Don't get yourself convinced of the situation until you talk to your doctor :)"

I'm not gonna even talk about the fiasco of needing to go to a treatment center out of my insurance network.  I'm not saying I can fix the problems we have, but what happens right now is criminal.

cancer,3bnpxj,ivysunshine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:27:09 2015 UTC,"Well.... cancer is kind of an interesting animal this way, and it does also depend on the cancer you have. The most appropriate term is probably that you are in remission, if the cancer appears to either be gone or dead.  My doctors never really uttered the magic words it's in remission either, we just went into a holding pattern.  I've heard people use the term that they are cured; I don't like that term so much because it implies that it's gone forever. I just have no idea what will happen in the future.  Sadly, recurrance is usually an option with some cancers, even when you think you beat it; I know absolutely nothing about yours so that's not meant as a downer, it sounds like yours is going pretty sweet :)  It just makes identifying it to people who don't have a lot of knowledge or experience with cancer more difficult!  Tldr; I would use the term in remission, if your cancer is in a monitoring period.  But, other people prefer different things!"

Most people are too afraid to ask more questions (which is unfortunate because I usually enjoy answering them).

cancer,3bnpxj,14mm,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:39:41 2015 UTC,"You can call it whatever you want to call it.  I'm in a very similar state of mind, I think.  I'm in remission from thyroid cancer as well.  My initial discover, surgery, diagnosis, and treatment happened in the span of two months.  I had NO time to digest exactly what was going on, and so I still feel really weird about it.  That said, whenever I talk about having thyroid cancer with other people, I diffuse the stigma of the word ""cancer"" before I even start talking about it.  ""Oh, well, just to preface the conversation, it's not a big deal, I'm perfectly fine and just have to keep an eye on things, but I had thyroid cancer.""  That's usually enough to allow the person to feel less uncomfortable, or at least comfortable enough to have a regular conversation instead of helplessly sympathetic looks and comments.  I have remnant tissue remaining, which means that I could grow another cancerous nodule back, but I don't think there's a right way to think of what's going on.  You had cancer in your neck and it was taken out.  You're still you.  You don't have to identify as one way or the other.  You certainly can if you'd like to.  I've said patient and survivor on different occasions and felt very weird and even a little guilty saying it, which isn't uncommon (but is unfounded).  It is what it is, but you can interpret it however you please."

But thyroid cancer is viewed by a lot of people... As... Trivial. Like oh no big deal, not a bad cancer to have, etc etc. It's frustrating and there's lot of emotions mixed in. Occasionally I feel guilty when I feel fear. But then I talk with someone else who is genuinely afraid for me. I can see the worry and I can see that they understand cancer isn't something to take lightly, no matter what kind it is.   Mine was also very fast. The end of november they found the lump.

At the end of the day, though, what matters is how we choose to see our own circumstances, rather than putting more importance into how others' see it.  My surgery was a year and four days ago and I'm still processing, too.  I went through a lot of guilt, sadness, and intense amount of anger in dealing with the people around me across everything.  But in the end, I know who does and does not provide me a positive support system in those situations.  I know what I need and what I don't.  Sometimes I need to allow myself to say I'm a cancer patient, or to think through my diagnosis or the intense amount of fear and panic I had before I was put under for surgery.  I didn't have any metastasis, but my initial biopsy result showed signs of invasion into the blood vessels of the thyroid, which I still think about.  Other times I need to breakdown my actual prognosis and treatment and remind myself that it's okay that I didn't have very long to process my situation.  I'm a survivor of cancer, even if that's still confusing or sounds foreign to say.  My impostor syndrome doesn't change the facts.  It's a lot to digest, man... and no one gets to convince you that you should feel lucky for having thyroid cancer instead of some other cancer.  We can do our best to understand that statements like that are probably coming from a good place, but yeah... it's not something we can just toss a label on and be done with."
cancer,3bnpxj,bellasarah,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:56:35 2015 UTC,"Hey. Thyroid cancer sister here. The tricky thing with thyroid cancer is that doctors are VERY careful when saying you're in remission. After surgery and RAi, they wait until your thyroid cell count is ""low enough"" to say remission. If they even do. It might actually take awhile after your second scan to have it reach a low enough number, if it does. It's lifelong monitoring after that. I always say now that I ""had"" cancer now that my cell count is low enough, but it doesn't feel as joyous as ""remission"" would. But i can't really even call it that and have it feel real or that it made a difference."

cancer,3bleao,tooyoungforcancer,2,Tue Jun 30 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, that sounds similar to how mine was found! I had pain on my left side, went for an ultrasound to check spleen, tech scanned the whole abdomen and spotted it on my right kidney.  Here's the good news, your size - below 4 cm - is better than most people who find RCC. You have a fighting chance, hang in there!  I notice you're concerned about clean margins - I had a partial nephrectomy. Obviously it's up to your doctor and you, but if your tumor is a low stage it's very easy to get clean margins - mine was a perfect little sphere and they can take out plenty of margin from the kidney. Then you can tell people you only have 1.8 kidneys! (note- during surgery they may take the whole thing out if they feel they can't get clean margins OR if you're a bleeder and they can't get in and out fast enough)  Make sure you get this done laparoscopically! You don't want to have a large incision if you can avoid it - it'll cut back on the pain (and scars, mine are almost gone in 1.5 years) significantly.  Pre-op, you're going to have to clean your bowels, sorry... This sucks more than anything in the world... Buy baby wipes and prep-H... Your asshole will thank you. You'll be confined to the bathroom for the full day, don't make any plans, and try to have someone in the house to help you out if you need anything (you literally won't be able to get up for very much time at all before the next round strikes)   Now, post-op - there will be a tube in your side to drain the fluid - getting it out will feel like a punch in the gut, but it's over quick, and then magically the post-op pain becomes much much less. Importantly - WALK AROUND! don't just lay there in pain, walk - it'll suck so much at first, but once you get moving and back to normal the pain goes down significantly.  Try not to take the opiates! They'll constipate you - and also get a prescription for colace handy. Once you start eating again it takes a while for your bowels to move. A lot of the post-op pain is from being backed up! Moving your bowels and your legs will lesson the pain greatly.  Okay, I think that's a big enough wall of text. Listen, this isn't my main account, but I'll PM you with my actual username. I'm on here nonstop. PM me if you need some advice on what to expect. You'll be back on your feet in no time, good luck!"

In general, colon cancer surgeries can be delayed a week or more without any impact that we know of on the curability of the cancer.  Sometimes things like obstruction or perforation mean there is a reason to do surgery sooner just because of the complications.  The doctor is right that it isn't until all the scans are done and surgery is complete that you'll know the complete staging, but about a third of all colon cancers have regional spread (lymph nodes) but no distant spread at diagnosis.  There is no reason to think that the cancer isn't contained or that the chemotherapy won't take care of the small cells that get away, unless you're directed otherwise by your doctor"

From what I understand, doctors often prescribe radiation and chemo prior to surgery to reduce the size of the tumor, and make the surgery easier.   I don't know if that's an option... I think you should probably get a second opinion... Go to another hospital, or request another doctor if that's possible.   Good luck. Wish I could advise you better."

cancer,3bjrsc,flying_unicorn,3,Mon Jun 29 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty grim is a good summary, but some people do live for a longer period of time if they have early stage disease and good response to therapy.  Prognosis and treatment will depend on the stage.  This is the purpose of the MRI and PET scan; the MRI will determine whether the cancer has already spread to the brain (which it often has); the PET will determine whether there is any disease outside the chest.  Any disease outside of the chest, or a malignant pleural effusion (collection of fluid caused by cancer between the lung and the rib cage) will up the disease to Stage IV which is considered incurable.  Stage III disease can be cured in rare circumstances but the cancer will usually return after treatment.  Surgery is almost never used.  The problem with small cell carcinoma is that it 'learns' to metastasise to other parts of the body very early on, so the only treatments worth considering are chemotherapy, and to a lesser extent, radiotherapy.  Cutting out the cancer, where that is even possible, usually just results in surgical side effects and a delay in chemotherapy.  Fortunately, small cell carcinoma is particularly sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Most people will have a good response and maybe even a complete response to chemotherapy.  Unfortunately the cancer will often relapse in the months after chemotherapy has finished.  Radiotherapy (which is what I do) is used in several circumstances which will depend on the staging investigations: * In people with disease limited to the chest, it is sometimes given in combination with chemotherapy, often with cycle 2 or 3.  It may be avoided if the amount of lung that would get hit by radiation is too high. * In people with any response to treatment, prophylactic cranial irradiation is normally recommended.  This usually 10 treatments given at the completion of the chemotherapy and treats the entire brain, even if there is no visible evidence of cancer there.  This is because there is a high likelihood of cancer cells being present in the brain at microscopic levels.  Chemotherapy does not get into the brain very well, so those cells can often survive.  Radiation is able to avoid this problem and has been shown to increase the amount of time people live for.  Downside is hair loss and memory problems in the months after treatment is given. * In advanced disease radiation can also improve the time somebody survives if it is given to the main tumour.  There is recent research showing that even if the cancer has metastasised, radiotherapy still improves survival times if it is given to the main tumour in the lung.  In summary:  Chemotherapy is the most important treatment and should start as soon as they have finished staging.  Radiotherapy should be considered if your dad has stage III disease or has a response to chemotherapy.  The usual path a patient will follow is chemotherapy alone or with radiotherapy, followed by radiotherapy to the brain and/or chest if they have a response, a remission for a period of time followed by recurrence; the length of the remission is hard to predict and usually you just have to wait and see.  MSK is fairly awesome and we use their guidelines even outside the US."
cancer,3bjrsc,Leinna,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"from my understanding he has a partially collapsed lung and they are not sure why.  I've heard a number of things and it's hard to keep it straight.  one of his bronchial tubes might be blocked by the cancer, or it might be an infection  causing swelling, that he probably has fluid in that part of the lung that's blocked.  They mentioned something could be ""squeezing"" on that part of the lung, and while no one has mentioned the possibility of this yet, a malignant pleural effusion sounds like it could also be a culprit. and a bad one at that.  Thank you for all the information, you explained a lot of things I had no idea to even think of.  One of the things i kept saying why can't they just cut it out of him and you covered that one pretty well.  Do you know anything about Immunotherapy and if that's a possible treatment option for Small Cell Carcinoma?  I heard something on NPR the other day how smilow has had such good results with it for lung cancer that it's becoming a standard course of treatment for them.  But I'm not sure if it's used more for Non Small Cell.  How long does it usually take to finish staging?"
cancer,3bjrsc,Leinna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"When the airway to a particular part of the lung is squashed by the cancer, the mucus that normally gets created there and shifted up to your mouth gets stuck and the lung will tend to collapse and 'fill' with fluid.  Not necessarily a pleural effusion - this is when fluid is outside of the lung in a space between the lungs and the ribs.  I was just at an update from ASCO last night and there are some early studies into immunotherapy with the new agents; they are very early results and it will take some time before they are generally available.  Also immunotherapy costs > $100,000 ...  I usually don't get PET scans for small cell carcinoma because the government does not fund them for that type of tumour.  If you can get the PET quickly (a few days) then great.  MRI brain should happen pretty fast as well."

Just so you and your family know,  there is a caregiver support group on the first and third Thursday at 5. I can get you more info of you're interested.  I just found out about it and plan to start next week.  Smilow offers many programs for patients also,  including yoga,  painting classes,  massage and more.  They really believe in healing your whole self.    Keep your head up,  there will be lots of ups and downs ahead and I hope for the best for all of you!"
cancer,3bjrsc,TeacherTish,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you, i'd love to hear more about the support group.  I'll be honest that sort of thing isn't usually ""my thing"" but i can also already tell that this isn't something that we're going to be able to handle alone."
cancer,3bjrsc,beamseyeview,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:10:43 2015 UTC,"I hadn't been to one in person (did one online) until recently, and it was helpful.  Unfortunately, it wasn't related to cancer or caregiving, though, so not all of my issues were understood.  I think it will be even more helpful when it is specifically for caregivers.  It's 1st and 3rd Thursdays from 5-6 in the Patient and Family Resource Center.  Pizza is provided.  You can call Liora (203) 200-6356 or Mary (203) 200-3355 for more information.    I don't think you need to register or anything."
cancer,3bjrsc,notgoodatcomputer,2,Wed Jul 1 00:19:04 2015 UTC,"/u/Leinna has a comprehensive response as always that you should read carefully.  I think everyone is entitled to second opinions, but I'm a lot less excited about them than most people on this sub.  I guarantee you that after the results of the staging tests, the people at Smilow or whichever center is closest to you will know the standard of care as well as whether there are any questionable areas that would benefit from a second opinion.  The upfront treatment for this disease is very standard and involves early chemotherapy - I wouldn't recommend delaying this to attend other appointments, not to mention the cost in dollars and time."
cancer,3bjrsc,ecsb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:19:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that.  We've requested appointments with both Smilow and Sloane asap.  We've sent over all the reports and we're waiting for both of them to review and get back to us.  We're going to whomever will see us first, ideally both of them will get us in soon and around the same time.  But i have no idea what the expectation is of how long it takes to get an appointment is.  I agree if we're looking at waiting too long to get the second opinion it's not worth it and we need to start some kind of treatment asap.  The question of course is how long of a wait is too long.  I have no idea how fast this can progress and how much days or weeks matter.  One  of the questions we have is if he's a candidate for immunotherapy, I heard something on NPR about it last night, that Smilow has been doing a lot with that lately and that they've seen very promising results to the point where it's becoming a standard treatment. We're not sure if it's an option for what he's got which is of course a question for the doctors there."
cancer,3bjrsc,lucky_ducker,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:07:42 2015 UTC,Treatment will start quickly.  Its a poor prognosis but not impossible.  Look for clinical trials because the standard of care is sub-optimal; but he can go on trial PROBABLY after the first rounds of chemo.  Otherwise you are taking the right first steps.

cancer,3bjrsc,budsw27,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:57:52 2015 UTC,"The PET scan is where it gets real, it tells you just how far it has spread. Biopsy results may take longer than you think, nowadays your local pathologist gives a preliminary reading but normally tissue is sent off to a distant lab for genetic testing, which takes an extra week or two.  You don't mention anything about ages, whether your dad is still working, or any money concerns. It's not too early to start thinking about those issues.  If you can fill in those blanks I might have more advice for you."
cancer,3bjrsc,bros402,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:46:01 2015 UTC,"My understanding with SCC is that once youve detected it, it's probably already spread.  Which is why the doctor said it's going to be stage 3 or stage 4 already.  Even knowing this I'm scared of the PET scan.  Thanks for the info on the biposy i had no idea.  Dad is 62, he is self employed and was planning on retiring around 70.  My parents have very little in the way of retirement accounts, which dad has been trying to build that up now that his business has been doing quite well for the last few years.  They've also been working on paying off debts and their mortgage, but they still have a ways to go.   I have a full time job and i do quite well for myself, but i make a third of what my dad does.  We've already talked about me leaving my job or at least taking a leave of absence (to make sure i'm capable) and running his business.  He got out of the hospital yesterday and was already back to seeing client last night, all he can think of is making sure he leaves something for us... and i'm starting to work with him whenever I can.  He has health insurance and they have enough money in the bank to cover treatments, but it's lost wages that will become a fast issue."
cancer,3bhhsy,PessimisticOptimist1,3,Mon Jun 29 06:57:12 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear about your aunt. I lost my Mom when I was younger as well, I was 12;  our Grandparents raised my older sister & I.   My youngest sister has metastatic cervical cancer that spread to her stomach, spine/bones, and only God knows where else at this point. I had to make the decision to swallow my grief, my fear, and all my weaknesses to BE THERE for my sister. She's my best friend even though she is 12 years younger than I. I'm 45, she's 34. I do let myself cry some at home, but mostly I'm trying to be strong and supportive for her as much as possible. Our oldest sister (48 & lives 5 hours away) is a breast cancer survivor, she tells me what helps and what doesn't. ""BE POSITIVE. Try not to let her see you falling apart or she'll worry about you, when all she may want to do is fall apart herself. She needs all her energy to fight the cancer. Spend as much time with her as you can."" Treasure every moment you have together, you can all get through this. I know it's not much, but it's all I have right now. We know we don't have a lot of time left as she gets worse every week. I tell her I love her every time we text, talk, or visit.  These few tips actually helped me a lot, as I'm very sensitive to their pain and suffering. I haven't cried in front of my younger sister, but I've gotten misty eyed when she talks about dying and leaving her husband and 17 year old son. After they give your aunt the staging, prognosis, treatment plan, etc. they should set up a social worker that should be available to talk to the family to help you all get through this together. Also, even while away at school you may want to look for a cancer support group for family so you can talk to someone about what you are going through. I pray the treatments have good results for your aunt. * HUGS*"

It's incredibly difficult to be thrust into a caregiver role, but as @dealite mentioned, stay positive around her, don't let her see you cry as she will start to worry, but don't be afraid to cry when you are alone.  The battle is a tough one but it's something you can get through.  Either way, enjoy the time you have with her, cherish the moments you get to spend with her.  Those positive memories will last a lifetime.    Check out http://www.cancer-q.com most notably the caregiver section for some great tips on how to handle a cancer diagnoses.

I'm terrified truthfully,  but I'm still trying to keep it together.

cancer,3bhhsy,lucky_ducker,2,Wed Jul 1 18:11:35 2015 UTC,"Many initial diagnoses of ""bone cancer"" are quickly amended to something else. Primary bone cancer is relatively uncommon, but many cancers will spread to the bone. My wife's first indication was pain in her spine; indeed her spine was riddled with tumors, as was her pelvis and thigh bone.  But the primary cancer was lung cancer. Similarly, a good friend found cancer in her pelvis, turned out to be breast cancer.  A lot will depend on just what type of cancer your aunt has and how advanced it is."

We live in a small town with a shit hospital. The townies refer to it as ""the place you go to die."" We were in the ER once and a guy came in bleeding badly from a stab wound. They told him to have a seat. My grandma suffocated to death because her physician said ""You don't look like you have pneumonia."" She had fifteen pounds of fluid on her chest.  Anyway, my aunt went to the specialist. The guy looked down her throat, felt around it and said, ""I can't feel anything, you're imagining it."" She chokes sometimes taking her medication or eating especially dry foods. What if its throat cancer and that asshole failed her?  I feel like I'm falling apart, so I can only imagine what she feels.  How do I support her during chemo? What do I need to expect aside from puking and hair loss?"

cancer,3b8g7m,ecsb,4,Fri Jun 26 21:33:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do this for a lot of my patients.  It is REALLY hard on everyone around.  I'm sorry.  Drains can help, but I'd try to find an arrangement where it can be done outpatient (GI does ascites, primary care does pleural taps, or all done by internal medicine outpatient doc?)"
cancer,3b8g7m,notgoodatcomputer,9,Sat Jun 27 02:26:20 2015 UTC,"The fluid build up is uncomfortable. It does not stop building up. I can understand wanting that pressure taken off. It makes it hard to breath. Chemo wont cure him, sometimes it prolongs life but sometimes it causes more suffering.  The best he can do is relieve the symptoms, one of which is fluid build up. Look up malignant pleural effusion on a decent medical site. try to make every moment count, my best wishes to you and your family x"
cancer,3b8g7m,burstabcess,2,Fri Jun 26 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"OP, I'm very sorry to hear of your situation . It's a very trying one.  Burstabcess, my dad is being killed by a malignant pleural effusion. It's a tough way to go. OP, Look up PleurX catheter if he is having fluid build up around the lungs. Helped my dad for a time until the cancer took over completely. After surgical implanting it can be used to drain by a RN. Hospice has people who can drain one.  One area that is confusing in OP's description is whether the doctors thought he should do chemo but elected not to, or if the doctors recommended against chemo before recommending hospice care. I don't think a doctor would recommend hospice without at least knowing what the cancer is, and OP says its of ""unknown origin""."
cancer,3b8g7m,ThrowawayEOL,4,Sat Jun 27 03:46:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with the above, it's uncomfortable. Is he on any medication for it? There are water pills that may be able to help with the fluid build up, at least to slow it down. I know this is isn't necessarily comparable to cancer, but my small parrot with liver disease also has ascites because of it (fluid build up). Since she's an animal, they can't prescribe a pill but she does get Lasix liquid in her water. It's a human medication, but the liquid version is often prescribed to children. The pharmacy I worked at prescribed thus fairly often for clients. Before we had a dosage worked out, she was getting drained every other week. With dosing, it's once a month. Perhaps it can be something to ask about if they can't get an actual drain in?   Anything to bring comfort, especially if he is forgoing treatment of the cancer itself is a victory."
cancer,3b8g7m,theRacistEuphemism,6,Fri Jun 26 23:11:46 2015 UTC,"The fluid build up can be very uncomfortable. Having that fluid removed takes a lot of pressure off of his internal organs, and therefore increases his comfort level. This does nothing to treat cancer or prolong his life, so I'm not quite sure why his hospice is refusing to perform the procedure. When my dad went into hospice his abdomen was frequently swelling with fluid and the administrators told us that they would continue to drain it as a comfort measure (not that it mattered, he passed within 24 hrs of being transferred to hospice). Maybe try other hospice centers? Not all of them have the same regulations."
cancer,3b8g7m,Reverend_Coen,4,Sat Jun 27 04:26:15 2015 UTC,"Having the fluid drained off is palliative - relieves symptoms - which, aside form the trip to hospital and having a needle shoved in your abdomen on a regular basis, has minimal other effects on the person.  Chemotherapy is not a curative treatment in this setting.  It could buy him some more time but he will eventually end up in a similar position with untreatable cancer that causes repeated fluid build up in the abdomen.  Chemotherapy would also cause a reduction in quality of life during treatment and potentially in the longer term.  My take on it is that he has refused chemotherapy to avoid toxicity but wishes to have the procedure for comfort.  If he is needing drainages that often then they should consider some sort of port that is easy to drain repeatedly."

Worst bout I had was eight hours of struggling to stay hydrated and running to the bathroom because drinking or eating anything would trigger another violent assplosion (sorry).   Out of curiosity, what caused your constipation? Was it pain meds or something else?"

The 5 day constipation was after my first round of chemo (ABVD) and I think it was the anti-sickness meds (ondansetron) that was the biggest culprit. I did take some laxatives the same day of treatment, but evidently not enough! Ended up in A&E but thankfully was able to do the trick with suppositories rather than having to resort to more...extreme methods (it's still horrendously awkward/embarrassing sticking drugs up your own butt, but it could have been far worse!) . I've kind of got the balance right now with chemo/laxatives but my digestive system still takes a bit of a beating with each round of chemo."

She was diagnosed at the end of May 2014 and by September she was gone.  The absolute hardest thing for my brother and I to do was accept her decision to stop fighting the fight after 3 months of intensive treatments.  We went from going full speed ahead with treatments, meditation, doctors appointments, etc to slamming on the brakes and letting life take its course naturally.  Two weeks later she was gone, the suffering was over and the grieving process begun.    Perhaps your friend is afraid of death.  Perhaps he doesn't want to endure chemotherapy, radiation etc.  Some people prefer to just let nature run its course.  It's worth having the discussion with him to find out, but there is a fine line between trying to push someone into something they don't want to do and encouraging them to get the help they need.    If he does want to fight, I recommend checking out http://www.cancer-q.com  There are some great resources available to help both the patient and the caregiver/friends/family through the cancer fight.

cancer,3b69xj,Chokatto,5,Fri Jun 26 08:58:34 2015 UTC,"Hey. There is no normal way to experience things. I'm a little more than 6 months out from dealing with my mom passing and I'm about your age too. I get the anger you're feeling - my mom had not had a colonoscopy in quite some time, and just thinking about that makes me very upset - what if she did and things were caught early? Would she still be alive? It's hard, but I just try to accept things as they are. We can't change the past, but can learn from it. It sucks. But I try to think that things happen for a reason, and that despite the terrible thing that has happened, the adversity is helping me grow as a person. Some days it's harder to believe this, but I try to think of it in a positive light as much as possible.   Don't feel bad about not being there more. You did what you could and what you thought was best. My mom was the same way - she would not have wanted me to miss out on things because of her. That would be a big burden to her, and I'm sure to your dad too. They loved us and got great enjoyment out of seeing us succeed and living life.  I also sympathize with your lack of big emotions. The hardest times for me were the weeks before my mom's death. But after she died, everything was a quick whirlwind of events - getting everything in order, the viewing, the funeral, etc. Plus, in the first few months, there are a lot of friends and family around. I also feared that things would all of a sudden 'hit' me more. And, well they kind of have to be honest. I honestly was doing pretty well the first 4-5 months. Lately though, it's like I realize the hole in my life much more. I get emotional much more easily. I think the crux of the whole thing, is that I'm much lonelier now. Sure, I have a lot of friends, and I'm actually pretty busy usually, but I really notice the change in my family now. It just feels so much smaller. Visiting my ""parent's place"" is now my ""dad's place."" Things have changed, but there is nothing to be done really other than to embrace the new normal. Holidays will be different, birthdays will be different, you may see one side of your family less than usual - there are a lot of big changes that could happen.  Try to be there for your mom. I get angry sometimes when I'm with my family... sometimes my dad will want to talk about things that I really don't feel up to at the moment (going to look for headstones etc.) but I try to put on my best face. Definitely take the time and space you need, but I also think it's important to be there for your family, because like I said, your family just shrunk significantly and your family is often your pathway back to stories, connections, funny memories, etc. that can remind you of your dad in a good way. No one else has that shared history with you other than your family.  Hopefully you can get some advice from my experience. It's ok to feel anger. It's ok to feel sad. It's ok to not cry. It's ok to cry. It's ok to feel relief. Feel what you need to, don't force it. I'm afraid we won't ever truly ""get over it,"" but take solace in knowing that someone meant that much to you. There will be a time where remembering your dad will bring a smile and laugh to your face, rather than sadness and grief. It will come in time. If you ever want to compare notes, feel free to PM me."
cancer,3b69xj,speaklouderpls,4,Fri Jun 26 13:55:52 2015 UTC,There is no proper or universal way to grieve. I would suggest finding a local grief group (usually located at a hospital) or seeing a mental health professional who deals with grief.
cancer,3b69xj,bros402,3,Fri Jun 26 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"Is this normal?   ...yes, it's practically mandatory. You are totally right to be angry about losing your dad, especially at your age. Anger is one of the stages of grief...others are denial, bargaining, etc. and the last is acceptance. We go  through them at our own pace and in no certain order. So yes, be angry, it's part of your grieving. Just know that your family needs you to be strong, as they are experiencing the same process, in their own way. I pretended to be okay after my mom died, but I was angry at her for leaving us. I let her go (during the course of therapy) by speaking to her empty chair. Seemed wacky to me at the time, but it worked. Cry if/when you have to, laugh when you can. I'm glad the funeral was a benefit. Grief is a bitch, but you can get through it. You'll never get over losing him, but you'll get through it. We do. And we're here for you. Best wishes for you and your family. Take care of yourself."

My father always told me his job in life was to do everything he could to make my life better than his was, to give me opportunities he didn't have, to allow me to grow in ways his parents didn't.  Your life, your uni life, and the wonderful person you are was probably his greatest comfort. He lived his life how he wanted to, it's your life to live now. That's his gift. Many universities allow students to take a leave of absence and re-enroll the following semester or quarter. Just don't quit uni. Talk to a therapist before making major decisions.   You and your family will be alright. Stay active and remember that your family loves you and you love them. That hasn't changed no matter how angry you or they get.

My dad's been diagnosed with liver cancer, it's not looking good and he's going through chemo, doing my research, and from what my brother has told me (he's a doctor), my dad has somewhere around a year left, maybe less but hopefully more. I don't quiet know how to deal with this, it's mostly just anger, and sadness that overflow me, I mostly take it out on my boyfriend. I'm home for the summer, my academic advisor told me to not make his mistake and miss out on spending time with my dad, he told me to go home and not worry about school. I'll have to return to school soon, I don't live far, but next semester I'm taking 18 credits and I'm set to graduate the semester after that. Last semester was spent at school, scorning myself for being there, but too afraid to go home and see my dad. I feel guilty all the time, sad all the time, angry all the time, helpless all the time. I never thought a person could feel this miserable and carry on.   My dad's top priority has always been my siblings and my education. they all made it through college (lawyer, doctor, teacher), and i'm just a year away from graduating with my degree. But I'm starting to wonder if the year would be better spent at home, with him.    I am currently seeing a counselor, but it's harder than most think to truly express everything you feel. I sit on that couch in front of her and don't say much, i complain about daily life things like classes, school, boyfriend, my sister. I never talk about the real things because it's frightening to say them out loud. She knows why i'm there but doesn't ask.   You're not alone. I know I'm not alone, because there's many of us dealing with similar situations. It is overwhelming to feel guilty for not being home, and at the same time trying to be in school to please my dad.

However I fear so much that when he passes, whether it's this year or 5 years from now I'll just leave for like 3 days and cope alone, leaving my family. That's just how I cope. I do it alone because being emotional around my family freaks me out. Is that normal? I don't know. What is normal? You do what you need to do, always.

From what I understand that if I want to see a doctor outside of what's been given, the insurance won't pay (because I haven't been refuted) and I'll have to pay out of pocket. It would take me weeks to save up enough money for one doctors visit without insurance. I thought it was just that they were the only doctors taking that kind of insurance."
cancer,3b5wmw,bros402,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"...You are only seeing a pediatrician and a surgeon about possible cancer? That is just wrong. Who is telling you this? Your doctors, your parents, or your insurance company? I'd suggest contacting the insurance company. What do you mean by ""I haven't been refuted"" - that doesn't make much sense. Do you mean that you need a referral?"
cancer,3b5wmw,Inorai,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:08:53 2015 UTC,"Correct. I told my pediatrician about my concerns at my final check up with them, so they started referring me to places and eventually this ""pediatric surgeon"". Hence why I don't feel secure about the way they've ended this. I meant referred, sorry about that. Calling them is what gave me the updated information about only being able to be covered if I'm referred."
cancer,3b5wmw,bros402,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:31:48 2015 UTC,"Okay. Since you are 18 - stop seeing your pediatrician if they are pulling things like this. Ask for a referral to a GP if you trust this guy, or just see a new one - I sincerely doubt your insurance requires a referral to see a new primary care doctor. See the new primary care and tell them what is going on and ask for a referral to an oncologist. Also, why did they send you to a pediatric surgeon when you are 18?  I am 24, I was diagnosed with cancer last month.  It is true, breast cancer tends to occur in people who are older, but if a bunch of your family members have been diagnosed with cancer (specifically breast cancer) between 16-20 - there is probably a BRCA mutation going on. See if your pediatrician will at least test for that, since if there is an excessive amount of breast cancer at a young age in your family, it's probably a mutation."
cancer,3b5wmw,bros402,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:19:37 2015 UTC,"This.  At a minimum your pediatrician should be referring you to specialists in the field who can make a more educated call.  Additionally, you should be able to find a list of the GPs your insurance company has contracts with in your area, or you could come at it from the other direction and find some GPs who seem to match your needs and check what insurance they take.  You don't need a referral to switch from one primary care to another, as long as both are covered you should just be able to pick up and leave.  A pediatrician, no matter how talented, is almost certainly not the person you want to be making calls like this alone.  My pediatrician caught the first signs of my cancer when I was a kid and she was the one who coordinated all the referrals to specialists until things were figured out.  Its their job."
cancer,3b5wmw,ikidu,2,Sat Jun 27 03:18:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly, I would trust my old pediatrician with my life - but he knew when to refer me to a specialist and when he could help me out.  Now I see him at my oncologists office :P  I think he has a hematological thing going on."

I don't know why I didn't think of doing it. So worse comes to worse I'll take the information they give me and ask my pediatrician to refer me to what they suggested  I honestly don't know why. I specifically asked to see an adult doctor of some sort since I already felt uncomfortable seeing a pediatrician still.   I'm sorry about your diagnosis. I'll be hoping for a good outcome for you.

cancer,3b5rct,throwaway19647331120,3,Fri Jun 26 04:54:31 2015 UTC,"Endometrial cancer is one of the most common cancers in Western society now that cervical cancer has an effective screening program.  Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinomas are the most common type of endometrial cancer and is probably the best one to have (aside from 'no cancer at all').  They typically grow more slowly and are less likely to travel to lymph nodes or other parts of the body - i.e. they are more easily cured.  The first step in figuring out how serious things are is to have a hysterectomy.  This will tell the doctors how far through the uterus/womb the cancer has spread.  We currently use a staging system to help categorise these cancers (less than half of the uterus, more than half of the uterus, involving the cervix, involving lymph nodes etc).  The stage your cancer is at will determine what therapy you need.  Make sure you have spoken to your doctors about fertility as there may be an opportunity to have egg/ovarian tissue storage.  The ovaries would usually be removed at the same time as the uterus so you will probably experience an early menopause.  It is very unusual for a 30 year old to have endometrial cancer.  They will also check for particular genetic changes in the cancer that may indicate an underlying syndrome, most commonly Lynch syndrome.  But that's a problem for further down the track.  Good luck with the surgery.  EDIT:  There may be additional treatment based on the stage of the cancer.  If you have a very early stage 1 cancer then you might not need anything aside from the surgery.  If you have more advanced disease you may need chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  There are quite a few pathways through this so best to find out what stage you have first."
cancer,3b5rct,Leinna,2,Fri Jun 26 13:08:52 2015 UTC,Thank you. How will the doctor know how serious things are or if it's spreading?  Is there a specific test the oncologist will perform or is it determined from the results of the endometrial biopsy?

cancer,3b21cr,cancerthrowaway628,3,Thu Jun 25 09:41:50 2015 UTC,"Hey love,  first of all, I am so sorry for this. I cannot possibly understand what you are going through. I can relate a little, tiny bit. My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 gastric cancer with little chance of 5 years survival (4%). I am 27, no degrees, under the poverty line and struggling to survive already. This was about 1 month ago, and I am slowly re-prioritizing my life. We as a family have sent my mom to another country for better treatment with my father. My older brother and I are here, working our asses off and trying to make enough money to send over for her treatment. I had a good relationship with my mom too. She's been in and out since her surgery where they removed most of her stomach. My father tells me she isn't doing that well, she isn't coping with the chemo. She is 62. I wish I could run there too, hold her hand, kiss her and hug her and tell her I'm there. I know she is in pain and I feel the family's pain and my own also. It kills me to hear news about her incessant vomiting and nausea.  Your family/siblings seem to be amazing people. Being there for your father and for each other. That is a gift many, many people do not have.  I sometimes don't know where we humans get our strengths from. I don't believe in the divine so it really is a mystery. Is it that we know that if we have no hope, our lives will be so miserable- therefore we know in the back of our mind that we need hope? and I mean need like we need air, nutrition, sleep? I don't know.  I hope your pain eases with time, and you find peace in your actions and with your family, buddy.  Love, UWG"

cancer,3b2cha,caretothepeople,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:33:24 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry - this is the horror that cancer can be and you're feeling it all. It's not pretty or easy and when people say ""everything will be okay!!"" that can only invalidate everything you're going through and make it so much worse.   If physically being there in person isn't possible, are there others ways you could feel connected to your family, perhaps by sending her cards and gifts to the hospital. It sound like she's going through a serious recovery so if speaking on the phone with her isn't the best idea, could you set up times to check in with your other family members so you can feel involved to the extent that you can be?   You could also take a look at something like CaringBridge which is a set that lets families set up almost like an internal social network to making communicating and coordinating easier. A lot of families affected by cancer find it really useful.   And do not neglect your own emotional needs. Check out something like the Family Caregiver Alliance, CancerCare, or the Cancer Support Community. They all have online community options, but it might also be helpful to find a local in person group where you could get face time with other people. It sounds like your boyfriends is supportive so its great you have him to lean on right now.   Sending you nothing but well wishes."
cancer,3b30nl,dad-has-cancer,3,Thu Jun 25 15:40:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on a bunch of things. Did he just get diagnosed?   What treatment is recommended? How long will it take? When will it start? What kind of side effects might it cause? What should we watch out for (aka when to call the doctor or go to the ER)? Since it is stage 4, what is the five year life expectancy?"
cancer,3b30nl,bros402,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:55:07 2015 UTC,"Encourage him to write down questions to ask so that he remembers them when it comes time to go to his appointment.  The oncologist will guide you with common questions if it's all a bit too much to start with and there will be many opportunities to have ongoing discussions across multiple consultations. Try not to get too anxious about asking every question you can possibly think of and instead, focus on the one's most important to yourself and your parents, as it is often difficult to retain a large volume of information in the first visit. You can always ask others at a future date.  Best of luck."
cancer,3b30nl,DrEagerBeaver,0,Fri Jun 26 11:25:42 2015 UTC,Another idea is to get copies of all lab reports and tests.  You can do some research when you get home and get a better picture of the situation.

cancer,3b1jlr,tnova,4,Thu Jun 25 05:38:26 2015 UTC,"I went through the exact same thing. Are you getting ABVD? I had an awful time with side effects and sometimes only had 1 or 2 days between treatments where I felt good enough to get out of bed. Going outside even to sit on the deck just for a bit always helped brighten my mood a bit. I'd go out there and read or just sit and watch the birds on the bird feeder. If I felt good enough to go on a walk I'd go on one with my Mom and she'd take the dogs on a leash, when I first started the walk I would think I couldn't make it up the block but once you get going it can feel really good.   Also I don't know how your bloodwork is looking but if your doc says it's safe, I would go to the movies at off times when not a lot of people were there. Prob not safe if you're neutropenic though.   Just putting on some headphones while you're laying in bed and listening to some good music always brightened my mood as well."

cancer,3b1jlr,CalBear1990,3,Thu Jun 25 15:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'm also going through chemo   treatment for Hodgkins Lymphoma at the moment,  currently on my 8th of 12 scheduled infusions. Your side effects are extremely normal,  and something that I'm dealing with too. Hopefully you have a good family support group around you to help you with the medical costs and getting to and from appointments. There will be a LOT of doctors appointments to come. There's no sense lying about it,  you're going to have days in the 2nd half of your treatment cycle where you feel good and want to regain some of your previous life. Those are the days that make up for the crappy ones during the first week of your cycle. But,  as the chemo treatments continue,  the good days can come less often. The one activity that always makes me feel good is being in the sun. Whether it's sitting in the sand at the beach or by a lake, or just sitting on a bench reading a book in a park,  sitting in the sun feels great. It doesn't have to be for hours either. Just getting warm,  and feeling normal is worth it. As for making food taste better,  good luck. I'm 4 months in and everything tastes like battery acid to me. The only foods I still can appreciate at all are salty ones. Spicy foods and really heavy rich foods have completely left me behind at this point. Candy can help with the mouth sores, but too much will mess with your digestion. Good luck."
cancer,3b1jlr,CalBear1990,3,Thu Jun 25 09:33:36 2015 UTC,"I've only had one infusion so far.  How much worse does each progressive one get? I haven't yet had any issues with the actual taste of food, I just felt like I couldn't keep a lot down.  Good luck with the rest of your treatment!"
cancer,3b1jlr,cuzzle,2,Thu Jun 25 15:14:38 2015 UTC,"Thankfully,  the treatments don't get substantially worse the more you have. What I have found my biggest problem is that my body's reserves get depleted as time goes along and it takes me longer in the cycle to bounce back. My blood counts have been all over the map,  so I routinely am dealing with additional side effects to things other than the chemo drugs. My white blood cell count has been pretty low the entire time,  so I have to take injections of a drug to boost my bone marrow. This causes inflammation and really bad bone pain. Right now I'm dealing with low platelet counts and low potassium. So I'm on drugs to boost those. I've also been on blood thinners due to a clot in my arm where my PICC line was. So, I rarely know if it's the chemo drugs that are making me feel poorly or if it's something else. It gets to be a guessing game sometimes.   Someone mentored going to the movies. That's a great way to be more social. I try to go whenever I can,  and it almost always makes me feel better to get out of the house. Also just going to Starbucks for a cup of coffee and sitting there with headphones on or surfing the Web on my laptop can be a nice day out too."

I have so very little energy and it takes me longer to 'bounce back'. Where before after a week I would feel fine and able to function pretty normally, now it takes me most of the two weeks.  I have pretty much put my life on hold, but also have tried to savor what I can and enjoy it as much as I can. I've done some painting, listened to audiobooks when I feel like it and worked on my relationships. I go for walks whenever I can as I've found the light exercise has made it easier. You'll figure what works best for you as you go through the treatments and the challenges. If you have any questions feel free to message me, I've always found it's nice to talk to someone going through similar expereinces. Good luck!"
cancer,3b1jlr,jumonster,3,Fri Jun 26 00:30:31 2015 UTC,"I'm very sorry about your diagnosis and your treatment. I was diagnosed in November and had my last chemo 4 weeks ago.  For me, I was absolutely hopeless on my ""bad week"" (days 0-5 after chemo). I was nauseated all the time. I was exhausted. No appetite, and eating or drinking almost anything triggered even worse nausea. Worst for me though was the ""brain fog"" I'd experience that week. It was like my internal processor slowed down, to the point where my train of thought was virtually non-existent.  While I felt bad all of those days, what really made me fell better was ACTING normal. I was lucky to have a job, so I was able to go into work days when I was up to it. Days when I laid around the house and slept seemed to make me feel even worse. Knowing that I would feel better if I just got up and got moving was enough motivation for me to do it.  So, if you can, get up and get out. Go to the library. Go to the coffee shop. Go for a walk. Do things you enjoy, so you could possibly look forward to doing them, instead of just dragging yourself out.  What also helped me was planning for the future. Work on your resume. Research the job market for your degree. Find places you'd like to work, and pre-fill the applications. Plan a vacation/getaway for when chemo is over. Life is on hold for right now, but it's not on hold forever...give yourself something to look forward to when chemo is over.  Also, tell your doctor that the pallative treatments he's giving you aren't cutting it. I had to change up my nausea meds twice during treatment because as treatment progressed the original meds I'd been given weren't cutting it any more. There is a whole aresenal of drugs they can prescribe, and they don't want you feeling any worse than is absolutely necessary.  Feel free to PM me if you ever need to talk. Chemo sucks, but you'll get through it, I promise!"
cancer,3b1jlr,MrsClaypool,2,Thu Jun 25 16:29:35 2015 UTC,"Just because you have cancer and are going through chemotherapy doesn't mean that you can't do anything.  You can still enjoy life and see your friends and family.  There were a lot of days when I felt extremely tired, but when I made myself get up and do things, I felt a lot better.  Waking up and making yourself ready for the day is kind of your first step.  On days when I just stayed in my PJs in bed and did nothing, I really felt unproductive - because I was.  Get up and do something!  My onc encouraged me to go on walks to combat fatigue.  Any type of moving around is good, even browsing stores.  Find something that you are interested in and submerse yourself in it!  Yeah, there are days where you just sleep in (a lot more), but try to get up and do something.  For mouth sores, have you tried magic mouth wash or the baking soda/salt water mixtures?  Those didn't work at all for me.  My dentist prescribed me triamcinolone dental paste, and it was like a miracle in a tube.  If I had a mouth sore coming, I would dab it on at night, and when I woke up it was gone.  If I didn't have it, I probably would not have been able to eat at all.  My insurance didn't cover it all, but I would definitely get it if I had to go through chemo again."
cancer,3b1jlr,kmoney55,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:09:39 2015 UTC,"I'm on round 14 of Chemo and starting SIRT I a few weeks. I have gone through and still experiencing the same side effect including peripheral neuropathy.  On how to get through I worked with my good friend who is a business coach (I am too) very soon after diagnosis and prior to starting treatment in November last year.  We identified very clearly my outcomes from all of this and a timeline of what needed to happen to achieve the long term outcome, we worked on what I have under my control and what I don't but what I could do to influence that. I also identified the  values and behaviours that drives me to deal with the issues. I started chemo on my birthday 3 weeks after diagnosis and it was the best present I had ever had because it meant it was the start of the fightback and I had the tools to enable that to happen. Every side effect and pain from the side effects means that's it's working and it's the cost of admission to the rest of your life to make it longer.  Chemo very debilitating but identifying small goals every day and doing them will build up your sense of well being.  In every situation you have a choice and you can choose to accept what your going through and embrace it. I'm currently at Glastonbury taking a weeks holiday from chemo, this was one of my goals to well enough to enjoy the biggest music festival in the world with my wife and friends. Yesterday I walked 6 miles the most since last summer and felt strong. I still get tired but I pace myself and listen to my body on what it needs.  Chemo is only a temporary thing to heal you albeit in a brutal way, it's not about liking it but accepting the side effects and changing your perspective. Also getting the right medicines to help and having people around you to help makes a big difference. Best to you for your treatment."

I had Hodgkins last year (and as you might know, it's a high % to survive). Just think of it as being sick, but just a little more than other people. Try to have some fun around it (I joked about it too) and don't think about it too much. Just try to find something that you like in the hospital or when you're at home.  I always played games on my laptop, whenever I had to be in the hospital 2hours+ I brought my laptop. Just because I knew I would be tired and just wanted to relax. If you don't feel like eating, try to drink some more to compensate (That's what I did and doctors said it was fine for me, you should ask to be sure anyways). If you feel like drinking ofcourse .  I guess the only thing I can say is goodluck and think about the good stuff that happens after treatment. (: !"

Another thing,  which sounds silly,  is coloring.  There are many adult coloring books out there.  I teach Kindergarten and every once in a while I sit and color with them.  It's so relaxing!

She was prescribed a tablet called jackavi (ruxolitinib) and after a month or so her spleen started to shrink. It's now back down to normal size but she also has at least 2pints of blood every 2 weeks. She's been diagnosed for around 4 years and was told she isn't able to undergo a spleen transplant as her body wouldn't take the procedure also due to a leaky valve in her heart they are trying to put off any surgery as there's a danger with putting her under. They took at least 2 bone marrow samples that I know of but said it would be dangerous to use a donors bone marrow as her body could reject it and the leukaemia  could be controlled using this tablet.  She has side effects from the tablet, weight gain and minor memory loss being the main ones so far but she was so skinny before she actually looks healthy again and the memory loss comes with age anyway(it's not really that bad). We're told the tablet is expensive and is imported from America every month as it goes out of date but the NHS pay for hers. If you have any questions PM me.

cancer,3b035m,Leinna,0,Thu Jun 25 09:19:47 2015 UTC,"I'd have to disagree.  We can cure quite a few cancers; for example children are cured of cancer in 70-80% of cases although they may be left with significant problems in the long term.  Most skin cancers are curable.  Many breast, bowel and prostate cancers are also curable.  Lung cancer is the exception and most people with lung cancer die from it.  That being said, glioma of the brain is usually incurable although sometimes people can live for a few years.  Oligodendroglioma which was mentioned above is a particularly sensitive form of glioma where the average survival is measured in years.  Unfortunately most forms of glioma are glioblastoma which is considered incurable and has a poor life expectancy of 12-18 months with maximum treatment.  People can live for longer than this occasionally."

cancer,3b035m,middlenamesneak,3,Thu Jun 25 11:10:52 2015 UTC,"Hey,  I'm likewise sitting in a daze at having been informed that my mother was today diagnosed with an aggressive stage 3 lung cancer. I'm told it has spread to her lymph node and possibly to her spine. I'm told the tumour in her lung is also pressing on her heart. Since the cancers are inoperable, I'm told it's not a matter of if, but when my mom will die.  My mom is 66 and has never smoked. She remains the only constant in my life, be it as sources of guidance, support and inspiration, or a smile and hug that makes a 26-year-old feel like a kid again. The next few months are going to be the most emotionally draining of my life.  To see someone else on the other side of the Atlantic (I'm based in Toronto) simultaneously going through similar stages of incredulous and gut-wrenching shock is nonetheless strengthening. Thanks for posting that.   I hope things go as well as they can for your father, and wish you whatever it is that could make you feel better right now.  If you happen to be into podcasts, there's an excellent interview series called The Duncan Trussell Family Hour, and 2 episodes in particular, where he interviews his own mother, who was also dying of cancer:  Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA3PcqmQ4ZE (They don't start talking about her cancer until about an hour in, but the whole episode is worth a listen for a laugh.)  Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP8iVVg7i1I  Hoping these will help you to re-examine and accept this experience."

Her particular brand of tumors was very aggressive and over the course of a year and a half she went from being a strong, determined woman to tired and ready to let go in dignity. I am still reeling from her loss. I try not to live in regret but this disease's swiftness and aggressiveness makes this difficult for me.   I wish you all the best of luck and I dearly hope your fathers treatment has every measure of success, I also urge you and your family to accept the facts of his disease as best you can and to be open and forthcoming about his diagnosis within your family.

Sleeping a little less (when I was in hospice, I slept 16-18 hours a day, now I'm sleeping about 12 hours a day). More alert, and able to read, write, wash dishes, etc.   I still have symptoms that keep me from being fully functional. But at least now I can start living my life again! Woo!  One of the hardest parts of being sick was the feeling like it would never, ever be over. And the doctors not knowing how long it would take.   My husband has been a trooper.

I did not have any of the same side effects you're describing, although I do not have ADHD, but I did have drastic mood changes as a result of the steroids they gave me. I can't remember the name of the one I was on but maybe if you're husband is on any steroids they could be the cause. It sucks that Zofran didn't help him out, that stuff was a Godsend for me.  Also I agree with you on the neupogen, luckily mine was covered by my insurance but I saw how much that shit costed and it's outrageous for something that can save so many peoples' lives.   Edit: The steroid was Prednisone"

And yes, without him having already meeting his OOP for the year, full cost for 10 injections of neupogen was $6,449.99. I feel very blessed that I made very wise decisions during annual enrollment last year before all of this started for my own health, which has come back to save us thousands of dollars in the long run.  Edit: I don't know what was going on with the Zofran either. I had gastrentonitis (dysentery) one time and that drug pretty much saved my life, it was beautiful. But his body just hates it, it doesn't help at all. I was quite shocked as well."

Anyways I would talk to your husbands oncologist about the behavior changes, if there's one thing I tell everyone about dealing with Cancer is to never be afraid to ask questions or make your doctors aware of even the tiniest things. You never know what the implications of a mood change or other small differences could mean, they could be signs of much greater problems or improper reactions to medications.

cancer,3b04p8,ParkaBoi,5,Thu Jun 25 03:14:57 2015 UTC,"Firstly, fuck alternative therapies. If they worked, they wouldn't be alternative. I've talked to people who went down that route and there comes a time of immense regret when they realise it's not going to work and it's too late to start conventional medicine. The look in their eyes at this point is fucking heartbreaking. If Steve Jobs couldn't get it to work with all his money, what makes your dad think it's going to be any better for him?  The treatment you describe is rough, but it's better than death."
cancer,3b04p8,OTN,3,Thu Jun 25 09:43:06 2015 UTC,"Radiation oncologist here. Chemoradiation for rectal cancer is usually very well-tolerated and works well. Seeking alternative/no treatment (same thing in my mind) is a very bad idea, as dying from a locally-advanced pelvic tumor is a very, very, very bad way to go."
cancer,3b04p8,Labrat33,4,Fri Jun 26 12:27:07 2015 UTC,"I am a medical oncologist who treats only GI cancers. Dying from progressive untreated rectal cancer is probably the worst experience you can imagine. Chemoradiation, surgery, and chemotherapy is a long but tolerable process and far better than the miserable alternative! In all likelihood, he will do better and feel better than you think."
cancer,3b04p8,Leinna,2,Fri Jun 26 13:13:34 2015 UTC,"Agree with the above.  I'd like to add that the effects of treatment are somewhat unpredictable in an individual person.  We know that if we treat the pelvis with a large dose of radiation, around 30-50% of men will become impotent.  What this means for your dad is that there is a risk of impotence but no guarantee.   From the radiotherapy perspective, most people I have seen through this treatment manage fairly well, although occasionally they suffer significant side effects with diarrhoea, urgency of the bladder and/or bowels, and skin redness/blistering particularly in the buttocks.  The stoma is often a good idea because it allows time for the rectal stump to recover from the radiation and surgery without faeces moving through it as well.  Once the person has recovered then the chance of union is better (at least that's what the surgeons tell me).  Having a stoma is not pleasant but usually better than incontinence of the anus.  Long term problems do occur in a small number of people but they are almost always far better than local recurrence of cancer as described in the posts above."
cancer,3b04p8,OTN,3,Fri Jun 26 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"Mostly true, but I would take a bit of exception to the impotence data mentioned. With high-dose radiation for prostate cancer (we usually go to 79.2 Gy these days) the rate of impotence is ~40%. With radiation followed by surgery (that's the key) for rectal cancer, the rates of impotence are also around 40% as you suggest. However, it's the combination of radiation and surgery that causes the risk rather than XRT alone. Pretty picky point I know, but just thought you might be interested."

cancer,3b04p8,fallingbackward,3,Fri Jun 26 20:03:25 2015 UTC,"I am a female that had 3C colon/rectal cancer treatment. No joke, it is pretty terrible. The only thing different about my treatment is I didn't have a colostomy bag. I told my doctor I couldn't emotionally deal with it so the reattached me right away instead of using a bag. I have many permanent side effects that often make me wish I had taken my chances and skipped the radiation and chemo. With radiation to the abdomen he will probably have permanent sexual side effects, I have them as well and I'm a female. In my experience the doctors didn't care about the side effects. Their focus is on quantity of life and not quality. That said alternative treatments don't work at all and late stage colorectal cancers will kill you. your choices are bad and worse. Logically understanding that treatment or death is your option you just deal with the crappy side effects. Also it's a honestly terrible thing that with later stage colorectal cancers treatment doesn't really guarantee you won't have the cancer return. The way I read all the research was the more traditional treatment you do the longer period you are likely to get before it comes back. Sorry to hear he has to join the club no one ever wanted to be in."
cancer,3b04p8,PurpleZen,3,Thu Jun 25 12:39:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I have anal cancer as well, and the treatment and side effects of treatment are pretty horrible. I have major digestive issues that I hope won't be permanent, but they might be. It pushed me into early menopause at 43. And I still have pain from the surgery months later - might be permanent also. I'm younger than OPs dad and mine was only stage 2. But I had a tumor that was over 50% of the rectal area and the surgery was very painful.   I have considered many times that if I had known the reality of the side effects, would I have opted for just the surgery and taken my chances?  I don't know. Being so young, and knowing the fatality of later stage rectal cancers, it was worth it. If I were older, I don't know. It was pretty bad experience going through chemo and the side effects. If it comes back, I'm honestly not sure what I'll decide to do.   Having a colostomy bag is gross at first, but it gets less gross over time. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks after chemo due to a bad reaction, and while I was there, I learned to not be grossed out by anything. After I got home, I had to deal with all the gross stuff on my own, and now, whatever.   As for impotency, that's a tough one. I think radiation is what is most likely to cause that. Talk to your doctor. For women, they use a vaginal spacer during radiation to help avoid the reproductive organs. It doesn't guarantee that it will be OK, but it increases the chances. Maybe there's something they can do for men, too.   Late stage anal cancer is a death sentence, and treatment is worse. Stage 3 is already pretty up there. I'd go with the treatment and have a long life, than take the risk."
cancer,3b04p8,ikidu,3,Thu Jun 25 21:16:28 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I have stage IV colon cancer so I know some of what your dad is facing now as treatment. I am a girl, so the impacts on my sexuality are different. In regards to the other things: I was on the chemos FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, just 5-FU and on the antibodies Erbitux and Avastin. The side effects were and are for all of the chemotherapies always strong for a few days after which they mostly go away and I recover. On the days I am relatively well, I am still active and I have a good time. For instance today I was at home in the morning, then I had radiation after which I went shopping for a few hours. Then I had a music rehearsal and after that I played a board game with my husband (I won :D) and we watched some Netflix. This is quite a full day in regards to the level of my fitness (especially the walking around town part). But I can have days like that, just not every day.  If you'd like to know more about my side effects (about what they consist in), feel free to ask and I will be happy to go on a little about that.  I have an ostomy bag (it's an ileostomy actually). Of course, I would prefer to have a normal digestion. But it isn't that bad for me actually. I can go swimming (that one's important for me), I can hide the bag very well and it doesn't hurt. Also, it doesn't feel very weird to me anymore (I've had it for almost 2 years). But please look for a good surgeon. I think, this is key! Making an ostomy isn't very difficult for the surgeons. But not every one of them does it well.   All the best to your dad and you!"
cancer,3b04p8,bros402,3,Thu Jun 25 22:15:48 2015 UTC,"The treatment will feel bad at first, then you will begin to feel very happy once there is the first sign of it working.  If he becomes impotent, he can just get some dick pills, then he can look  like a Cialis commercial!  The last thing a doctor wants is their patient to be in pain and/or discomfort - get them to prescribe things in advance. Ask if the chemo can cause acid reflux - if it can, get them to prescribe an antacid. Also get them to prescribe an anti-emetic (anti-nausea med).  If it doesn't work, he would be in as much discomfort in pain if he didn't try it, if not more. If it gets to that point, which I doubt it will, they have palliative and hospice care programs that could make his time very comfortable.  If he is up for it - try marijuana to help alleviate symptoms of his treatment, just ask the doctor on their opinion first."

Colostomy bag and urostomy bag if they take his bladder and prostate.  The surgery will very very likely damage his ability to get and maintain erections.  Often drugs do not work effectively after they remove the prostate.  He would need to discuss with a surgeon how extensive the surgery would be, how likely it is they would spare erectile function, how likely it would be if they will need to do an extensive surgery (remove his bladder and prostate).  And the surgeon would be able to tell you how long to expect the bag in place."

That being said, maybe a gift the 2 of them can share -- tickets to a movie, gift card for a massage and/or spa treatment, dinner at their favorite restaurant, something like that.

""B symptoms"", or constitutional symptoms, are symptoms that may appear in the setting of leukemia and lymphoma. You can find more information about symptoms here. Do you have any of these symptoms (especially the big ones like weight loss, fatigue/malaise, night sweats, and fever)? If not, I wouldn't be as concerned about it being lymphoma, although as others have commented sometimes there aren't many symptoms. However, you're more likely to show symptoms than to not have any, so do keep that in mind. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you.    In my case, I felt like I had mono for about a month before the night sweats started and the weight loss really became apparent. The classic B symptoms really started in earnest about two weeks before I finally got checked out, and my bone marrow was 82% leukemic blasts."

I had significant swelling in the side of my neck for the past month and a half and was waiting for my endo appointment, but got sick of waiting and frankly didn't feel comfortable putting off a sonogram until August.  I called up five or six different endo offices, found the one that could see me the same week, called my other endo and had them fax m records, and stressed to the doctor my circumstances.  She was able to contact their radiologist department and squeeze me in for a same-day sonogram.  Not every provider is going to be this flexible, but it doesn't hurt.  At the very least, it will help you feel proactive and in control.  At least, it helped me in that way.  Monday isn't far off.  I felt the same as you when I was waiting.  My thyroid came out because it was pressing on my windpipe, so I sat around in Phoenix without a thyroid for close to a month before I got my biopsy results back from some lab in Boston.  It was really annoying.  I wasn't so much worried about being diagnosed as much as I just wanted to know what was next: Do I need treatment or can I put this behind me?  Not having direction and feeling stagnant was the absolute worst part.  Keeping busy helps.  Being positive and constructive goes a long way to changing how you view your situation, too.

cancer,3auldi,garygnu,-4,Wed Jun 24 12:48:14 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter that there are different approaches to different cancers, if they aren't really ""effective"" and if their only goals are to reach a 5-year survival rate while only eliminating the symptom(tumors) of the cancer.  There is no cure, but they will charge up to 15,000 for a single chemotherapy treatment.  Surviving 5 years after diagnosis is considered a success by them. Early diagnosis only helps to add to that success.  Who chooses to respond to cancer with a positive attitude alone? Anyways, let's add in another option. Respond with changes in lifestyle and diet. Then let's combine that with a positive attitude, strong will, and a healthier body and immune system.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15630849 Consistently proven to be the most effective? I wouldn't consider 2.1% effective, but we have been convinced that the treatment is absolutely necessary. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1113569 A nice chart on the right. Mortality rate of cancer has almost tripled since 1900.  http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4838a2.htm ""From 1915 through 1997, the infant mortality rate declined greater than 90% to 7.2 per 1000 live births."" Many babies and young children died from infectious diseases before we improved sanitation. Their deaths dramatically decreased our average life span.   Let's try to take responsibility for what we put into our bodies. We each have a mini universe within us; let us be better gods to the 37 trillion by providing a cleaner and healthier environment. It will be tough, but it will be a whole lot easier if we all become better influences on each other."

It's never been this messed up. No BC.   I have never had bad cramps, but it's constantly cramping/hurting on both sides by my hip bone   I have zero appetite and when I do eat, I get queasy. I've thrown up a few times.   I can't stop going to the bathroom, but it's not like a normal pee. It's not drip, but it's weaker. Talking 20+ times a day.   This clear discharge. Made me think UTI but I did a round of ABX  I am so tired. I fell asleep sitting up at work.   It's 90+ degrees and I keep a heater on under my desk  I feel like I get winded super quickly, but I might just be out of shape.   Things that might not be related-   I was gaining weight pretty quickly-mostly in my stomach. Over the past two weeks, I've lost almost 10 lbs. there is a new lump in my upper abdomen that could be a hernia.   Pain in my upper back, shoulder height. Could be RA.   Constipation   Not a full nose bleed, but my nose will drip blood occasionally. This is new- past few days."

No other clue that there might be cancer.   Once she saw the ultrasound, she immediately made an appointment for me with the gynecologic oncologist and sent me for a doppler ultrasound.  The results of the doppler gave a hint that there might be cancer.  Obviously once I had surgery that was confirmed.  I did have other symptoms but they were most likely from the large cyst and I was starting menopause.    I had always thought that if I had cancer I would somehow know.  Now I know better :-)  The only way to be sure is having that biopsy.  Good luck at your doctor's appt."

I had been on depo so my lady stuff had been a bit erratic and I had been going to the gym to lose weight so I couldn't put weight increase/decrease down to it either.  I noticed when I was on the exercise bike that something wasn't right down there.  My tumor didn't show anything significant on CA125, but my LDH was through the roof prior to surgery.

cancer,3av0zi,sunrayevening,7,Wed Jun 24 13:56:46 2015 UTC,"When you have cancer, many people make all kinds of suggestions on things you should do. Smoke pot, coffee enemas, supplements.

His doctors gave him Marinol when he was having the most trouble keeping food down, and he said that, aside from a bunch of nasty side effects, it was a good remedy.   As his roommate, I try really hard not to cross the line of being apathetic and sympathetic, so suggesting cannabis was, at least in my eyes, my way of letting him know that I care about his well-being; I hope he didn't take my suggestion as a nuisance. When I first suggested it, he seemed extremely interested, but had a few concerns that I mentioned in my original post that has kept him away.   In general, I don't bring it up unless he does, in which case he's usually asking about ways he could consume it if he decided to. So I don't think I'm pestering him, and I do respect his choices. I mean, he's doing pretty well so far, and I'm not about to try to get in the way of that. Thanks, I definitely don't want to be ""that guy."""

I only brought it up to him once, but he keeps mentioning how he wishes it weren't illegal in this state so that he could use it as a (relatively) cheaper way of managing his treatments' side effects. The only things holding him back are that he doesn't know if it will have negative interactions with his medications, and that he doesn't want to feel like a criminal for having it. I haven't pushed it on him at all."
cancer,3av0zi,tarlack,5,Wed Jun 24 13:38:36 2015 UTC,"yeah, they would have a hard time firing him as a patient for that.  One, its not routinely tested (you don't do urine drug screens on cancer patients, do you?) two, try firing an acutely ill patient and just wait for the lawsuit when something bad happens.  it takes time to fire a patient.  Unless of course he signed a contract saying he would not use MJ.  He is likely paranoid.  He should bring it up in earnest if he hasn't already.  Perhaps he is telling you a white lie so you'll drop it though."
cancer,3av0zi,Leinna,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:04:24 2015 UTC,"That last reason is why I don't bring it up to him, so I don't want him to feel pressured into trying it. Not sure if he signed any contract about marijuana specifically, but maybe that was implied in some paperwork saying that he won't use any medications that aren't explicitly approved by his doctors. So that's a good point you brought up."
cancer,3av0zi,jaydak,6,Wed Jun 24 13:59:00 2015 UTC,"I live in a state where weed is illegal. I've told every medical professional that I've worked with that I smoke weed. The worst response I've gotten has been a neutral ""OK"". Every other response has been along the lines of ""you should probably keep doing that"". Cancer doctors don't give a fuck what you do to alleviate your symptoms, so long as you don't try to use it as a replacement for actual therapies.  I agree with other commentors. He's likely telling you what he thinks will shut you up about it. You've offered, don't push.  I've got a fairly similar situation with a friend's dad. He asked me to get a hitter box and some weed for his dad and to show him how to use it. I got everything ready, but the dad said that he was worried the VA would kick him out over it. VA has no such policy, but it's obvious the dad doesn't want to try it. I've refused to even talk to the dad about it. I'm no drug pusher. If he ever tells his son he wants it, I'll happily take it over and help him out, but I don't believe in pressuring people into doing things that are 1. illegal and 2. unwanted."

cancer,3aui3s,clear831,2,Wed Jun 24 06:39:46 2015 UTC,"HER2 amplified cancers are typically more aggressive than HER2 negative cancers.  The only advantage is that there is an additional treatment available (trastuzumab or Herceptin) that improves outcomes when compared to not having those drugs.  I would have thought that it was unusual to have a HER2 positive lobular carcinoma, they are usually hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative.  The most important thing to know will be whether she has any lymph nodes involved.  Has she had surgery yet?"

cancer,3asru5,BakedAlaska,5,Tue Jun 23 05:30:15 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you are going through this. My sister has cervical cancer, she was diagnosed stage 2b in Dec '14. She had so many people surrounding her I didn't think she needed me. She went through her first round of chemo/radiation without me there, something I felt the guilt about it the entire time. I didn't think she had the energy for more people. Now in May she and I were renewing our connection, (she's not only my little sister (34) but she's been my best friend, biggest supporter since she was 12.) we found out the cancer has spread and she is now considered terminal. The doctors are guessing 4 months to a year since the cancer is in her stomach, spine (possibly more than just her spine, but her bones), and she had a swollen lymph node biopsied that they never told me the results of. She's on palliative chemo now. Anyways, I'm there now. We've not talked about anything past me being there whenever, for whatever she needs. It was very difficult thinking of her sick, like I failed her, I couldn't protect her. I knew something was wrong for a year and didn't push her enough to get to the doctors, if I had they may have caught it in time to put her into remission. I know I can't blame myself, but having a sibling ill (our older sister had breast cancer about 7 years ago) I felt helpless. I could do nothing for her, now I know I just needed to be THERE to support her and give her what strength I had. I'm just trying to put some perspective on your sibling's behavior. Thinking about the mortality of my sisters just about killed me, but I was being selfish; I realize that now. I'm not trying to minimalize what you are feeling, by no means.   You shouldn't have to be telling them, but do it anyways. Tell them: I NEED YOU, I NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO, I NEED MY BROTHER/SISTER NOW LIKE NEVER BEFORE.  I wish my sister had come out and told me. When our time on this Earth is gone, there is no more second chances. I want no regrets, hopefully they don't either.   You're wife is there because she loves you, that's what marriage is about, in sickness and in health. If my husband were ill and not talking to me about his feelings, etc. I'd be even more lost. I hope she is finding support somewhere as well. Maybe a family cancer support group in your area? My prayers are with you and your family.   P.S. I hope this isn't out of line."

cancer,3asru5,ikidu,3,Wed Jun 24 17:09:35 2015 UTC,"Hi there! This brought tears to my eyes. I am so sorry about how life and many people around you are treating you. ;(  I was quite disappointed about how my brothers were not responding to my situation the way I would have needed it. My feelings got to a point that I had to tell them. I knew that if I didn't, the relationships I had with them would suffer. I would get more and more disappointed and angry and my own behavior would change much for the worse. The fact that we talked about it helped us all a lot. There's nothing wrong with telling your aunt and siblings in a very frank way that you would wish for them to be there for you more. Think about what it is that you wish they did and ask if it is possible. Maybe it isn't - but it would help you to know why. Maybe it is and they just need to be pushed a little.   Also, I have the same cancer as you. Colon, stage IV. Mets in lung, liver and peritoneum. I was on FOLFIRI plus Avastin a year ago for 12 rounds. Then they moved it to only 5FU and Avastin. The chemo has begun to be less effective as my last scan showed. I will probably have to change treatment at the end of the summer. I will probably be back on FOLFIRI with another antibody (Zaltrap it's called, I think). Maybe we will also think about putting me back on Erbitux, I was on it 2 years ago. I tell you this to show you that there may still be options for you too after your first treatment plan.   Also, once I got over the initial shock of the ""it's terminal"" news, I am feeling much better. I have many enjoyable moments. I can't say that I am great or that I am not scared or whatever. But I can say, that I don't always feel overwhelmed with my feelings. I hope and think that you will make the same experience. :) And I hope that your support network will move their asses a little more. Pardon my language. ;)  If you'd like to talk a little, you can shoot me a pm no problem. English isn't my first language though. Just fiy - I will understand what you say but I am a bit less skilled to put my thoughts into words. ;)  Also, this sub helps me a lot and I know it does others too.

cancer,3aszyd,bros402,2,Tue Jun 23 13:25:43 2015 UTC,The best tip is that doctors are often incorrect with their assessments.  This can be either a good or a bad thing.  I have seen people given a diagnosis of months to years who only live weeks; and others given a diagnosis of weeks or days who improve and come back for many months afterwards.  I think if the doctor is saying 6-12 months then it means that as long as the treatment works your mum will be fine for the next little while at least :)  People can live with metastatic breast cancer for years but it depends a lot on how they respond to treatment and what treatments are available (e.g. hormone receptor positive versus negative).
cancer,3aszyd,Leinna,0,Tue Jun 23 12:15:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say doctors are incorrect with regards to ""how long someone has"" because, as they will tell you, it's an estimate based on the most common trajectory of previous similar cases and some intuition.  Because wellness and health are so complicated even when we are not sick with stuff like cancer, you'll always find plenty of cases where their estimate was way off. But you'll find many cases when they were accurate with their estimate too.  If a doctor said a loved one had 6 months to live, i personally would plan for less and be pleasantly surprised when we have more time together. :) That said if I were the patient, I might go about things differently. :)"

Try and keep his spirits up as much as possible - it could be a rough journey, but you'll all get through this. That's such an important thing to keep in mind - that you will ALL get through this.    Find him high-caloric drinks (Ensure etc.), find him one that he likes and get him a bunch of those. Radiation to the neck is not fun, and he may end up losing his appetite and desire to eat, so shakes/drinks will do him well. Good moisturizer (something like Eucerin) and oral hygiene stuff (Biotene etc.) will also be helpful."
cancer,3araol,bipboop,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, support is the most important thing. Make sure you can become an avenue for your dad to express his stress and emotions.   Diet wise, he should be referred to a nutritionist for what supplements he needs. However, you can help by monitoring his eating and nutrition intake and encourage him to eat. Give him suggestions for things that are high nutrition, and easy to swallow. Of course, avoid spicy foods, too hot/too cold foods (no smoothies/ice cream :(), smoking and alcohol, or anything that'd irritate the mouth/throat.  Skin care is also very important. Make sure he has a water-based, non-scented moisturizer. He should also avoid the sun, which kind of goes against his favorite hobbies, other than board games. Try to find activities to do with him indoors, over the web. Avoid commercial mouthwash for oral hygiene, as they contain stuff that irritates the mouth. Use baking soda mouthwash instead, or ask the doctor/radiation therapists."
cancer,3araol,UnholyUrine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:32:23 2015 UTC,"Also, oncology rehab is a pretty great resource if available. I know you're out of town, but if someone's going to act as his caretaker, ask them to look into that (his oncologist should be able to give a referral). Chemo and radiation are going to deplete his energy, and a good way of maintaining energy levels is by exercising (within his limitations of course).   And ditto to everything said above. Radiation Oncology should have recommendations for some nice mouthwash that can alleviate the discomfort associated with chemo and radiation.   Tell your father (and his caregivers) to gather as many resources as possible - rehab, nutritionist, support group etc. A ton of oncology  patients aren't aware that those types of things are readily available to them.

cancer,3araol,turnsar2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:33:49 2015 UTC,"I don't discount the power of ginger, but I recall being told that chemo patients should avoid green tea (it either speeds up or slows down the time chemo takes to circulate through the body). I'm sure it's fine in moderation, but is still something that should be brought up with the doc (much like any herbals and supplements)."
cancer,3araol,bipboop,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:08:29 2015 UTC,"I would argue that is fortunate that they are not operating as radiation can give a much better functional outcome than surgery - depending on where in the throat his cancer is.  He will need a lot of support to get through the treatment.  The first couple of weeks are usually easy but after week 2-3 it can get very tough, very quickly.  He won't lose the hair on his head so I don't know about beanies (is it cold in the US at that time of year?).  I'd agree with the suggestion to find a supplement drink he likes, although tastes can change quite significantly during radiation treatment.  Nausea is pretty uncommon with radiation to the throat but can affect a few people.  I think that being around and showing that you care - letting him know that there are lots of great reasons to get through the treatment :)"

His mouth is going to be very dry and Biotene helps a lot with that.  There's also a dry mouth spray called Entertainer's Secret, which is helpful to have around.   Treatment makes you tired.  He probably won't really feel the effects of radiation for the first week or so, but after that, it's likely to take a toll on his energy level.  Does he have Netflix?  Do you?  If so, maybe the two of you can pick a show and binge watch it together.  It will give you something to talk about other than cancer.  Also, smoothies are great and a little blender like the Magic Bullet is easy to clean and only makes enough for a single serving.  If you are looking for gifts to send him, how about a water bottle?

cancer,3aqesm,Komorichu,2,Mon Jun 22 17:43:53 2015 UTC,"I had 6 doses of it as part of R-CHOP21 regime.  It was administered before the four other chemotherapy drugs and was the easiest to tolerate for me.  In my experience, it did a superb job.  After the second cycle, I had a diagnostic pet scan, and the interpreter noted a ""near complete and dramatic response to therapy"".  The obliteration of the tumor due to the Non-Hodgkins lymphoma I had at the base of my femur was very noticable.  This drug was a huge leap forward in the treatment of lymphoma after a period of stagnation.  You can read many New England Journal of Medicine articles which attest to the effectiveness of combining Rituxin with standard chemo regimes.    Something notable about it: it's super expensive.  Something like 15,000 USD per treatment.  I have heard of situations in which an oncologist recommends Rituxin as a sort of secondary treatment and patients being priced out of it because their insurance won't pay.  Sad."
cancer,3aqesm,eatmaggot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:05:54 2015 UTC,"I've received Rituximab twice. As part of R-EPOCH and also apart of R-GDP for grey-zone lymphoma (a rare type of lymphoma with characteristics of both Hodkins and Non-Hodkins) . Anyways I found I tolerated Rituximab really well. The first time they give it to you, expect a long day as it is a very slow infusion as you can develop a sever allergic reaction to it (this never happened for me). After the first time you will get it at a much faster infusion rate, cutting down on your total infusion time.   Both treatment options worked well for my lymphoma, the only issue with the R-EPOCH was it came back 9 months later, hence the R-GDP (and now I am awaiting a stem cell transplant). If your cancer cells expresses CD20 marker its a good treatment option! Hope that answered your questions."

As a guy it's kinda crazy but otherwise rituximab is one of the less horrible medicines I've had to use.

Side effects depend on the site being radiated-- mine was a tumor in my skull so I had some scalp sensitivity and hair loss in the area. I only had 15 'doses', so my treatment lasted only 3 weeks. For me it was by far the easiest part of treatment. The only annoying part is that radiation is an everyday thing and they like it if you go at the same time everyday. so I had to go every morning at like 7:15am. Make sure to ask about site specific side effects though!"

I got used to the pattern of the chemo treatments like you have, which is good! In my experience with Radiation I had 14 days of it and the treatments only lasted about 10 minutes. I am sure it could change depending on where the treatment area on your body will be. The main areas for me was my upper right and lower right of my chest.  The only side affects I really ever had was i felt pretty tired after the treatment and sometimes my stomach would hurt and I wouldn't want to eat.  Compared to Chemo I thought the Radiation was a lot less worse than Chemo at least in my experience with both of them. You honestly can't feel a thing when they start the Radiation, I tried so hard to try to feel it but you just can't!  My last radiation treatment was in January and I am now 18 years old!  Just keep your head up and once you are done with chemo it will just be smooth sailing from there."

Don't listen to your cousin - 800 mg of tylenol for 20 years wouldn't wreck a liver - you need 4000 mg of tylenol in a day to wreck a liver.  If she has liver cancer, they caught it early, which is quick enough to treat her.

Urologist confirmed I probably have testicular cancer, but there's no way of knowing without a biopsy - which in the case of testicular cancer involves them removing the testicle.  You'll go in (my appointment was the Monday after my Thursday urology appointment), get knocked out and they will make a ~4 inch incision in your groin.

Next Monday, more bloods before a multi disciplinary hearing is held about my condition and I get an appointment to be TOLD of my condition.  *Tell your wife. *Things will move quickly and she is stronger than you think. My wife's father died of stomach cancer, so I held off telling her out of fear for her. That just pissed her off that I didn't tell her.  Testicular cancer has the highest survivability rate of any cancer. You're going to be alright."

You can be driving after the third day if you have to, but not if it hurts to practice an emergency stop. I was driving by Thursday, but only a short distance.  For general pain relief, paracetamol and ibuprofen worked fine."

But I have to tell you, and I know you don't know me (and feel free not to take advice from a stranger) I felt so much better once I connected with the world. It didn't have to be a lot, just sitting in a silence with a loved one or friend (I know you said you had support, and that's great.). Finding that one person to be my anchor when I was a grief stricken teenager was vital for me. I hope you have someone that can be that anchor.  Best wishes go out to your family and yourself."

I was super isolated in my treatment and for about 4 or 5 months following it until I connected with YACC (Young Adult Cancer Canada) on a retreat. I'm pretty sure there are equivalents in other countries as well. It's been really good for me to talk about fear of recurrence with other people that get it. I've been able to look at recurrence with a better understanding. Cancer can cause PTSD like symptoms in many people affected by it, get yourself the support you need. Good luck."

I just moved out of my home state after undergrad to go off to graduate school... first time really ""being independent"" and such financially. Had pains in my abdomen before finals, chalked it up to stress. When they didn't go away over my holiday vacation I decided to see a doctor... Ultrasound found it. Turns out, it wasn't what was causing my pain - wrong side of the body. Doctors have no idea why it happened (and still does to some extent). Completely incidental finding.  Scary to think if they just told me ""take an advil and go away"" I'd be, well, dead in a few years time if not already."

That way your dad can bring it up with your mom, who I'm sure is scared and might be unsure on how to tell her family. It's a tricky situation but it's good to develop support systems so she has someone to go to and you and your siblings have someone to go to.  You can always come here onto reddit and vent or whatever and let us know how you feel. We'll support you as best we can. I do recommend taking a breather, getting some fresh air, and gauging your dad on whether you should approach her or she approach you. It really depends on your family dynamics. Just listen to whatever advice you think is helpful and applicable to you and your family."

I did do a prophylactic intrathecal therapy as a part of the Hyper CVAD protocol the first time I had ALL.  It's been almost 7 years since I had radiation, and I've gone through an acute depression and I had cataract surgery.  But in terms of my mental faculties, I don't  think  I have changed that much."
cancer,3aiywx,dkdelicious,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:07:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. I'm sorry that you've gone through the depression, but do you think that's related to the radiation? My understanding was more that the radiation would affect cognitive abilities/mental faculties (on which score I'm glad to hear you haven't had problems)."
cancer,3aiywx,dkdelicious,2,Mon Jun 22 12:22:22 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say if that was a major factor, but I doubt it.  I think it was more a combination of life factors: being isolated in experience at a big university, never really seeking counseling, and the unknown outcome of cataract surgery as an artist.  So probably more from emotional irrational thinking, but I guess it was a psychological breaking point from years of cancer treatments in general.  Good luck with treatments!"
cancer,3aiywx,Leinna,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:47:11 2015 UTC,"It can cause problems particularly in the long term.  There is often some memory effects which are worse at 4 months but usually improve.  Long term problems don't occur to everyone and the dose is relatively low (in terms of radiotherapy).  The biggest group effected are young children who still have developing brains, looks like you are past this so those problems won't affect you.  Recurrence of lymphoma in the brain is far worse so it is usually worthwhile having the prophylaxis."

It was a weird and kinda funny experience. I'm not very religious myself, but I still appreciated the sentiment that the priest was just trying to help comfort me.  Remember that if people are saying stuff like this to you, they are just trying to comfort you and while it may seem misguided to you, remember the sentiment behind it."

They'll be checking your blood for thyroglobulin, and maybe scanning you. Once they're happy you're clear, they should start to ramp you up.

I felt bad for not donating and getting angry...but then again, I'm a cancer patient and haven't benefited from any kind of ""financial assistance fund"" myself, so how do I know these people would put my money to better use than I would?   When I realized it was a robocall, I yelled at them to take our number off the list and said I'm an actual cancer patient and can't exactly afford to spare any money. Ugly, but you're right...it felt good to vent."

cancer,3abdj4,bros402,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:36:43 2015 UTC,Did she get any results?  Her breast surgeon might have given her an indication of their opinion of the sample. When I had my mammogram the radiologist had me have an ultrasound and then examined me. He told me himself that he was pretty sure I had inflammatory breast cancer. Of course those symptoms are on the skin.   I hope your mom receives good news. If not please know that even the worst news doesn't always mean a death sentence. I had a 30-40% of surviving 5 years and I'm here!    My biggest piece of advice is to do research on places like breast cancer . Org The members there post the most current studies and research. They offer amazing support for the patient and family.

cancer,3abdj4,sneeze042,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:57:28 2015 UTC,"I used to work with a breast surgeon. It could be benign, also known as a fibroadenoma or cyst. The ultrasound is not good enough for staging so they probably would not be able to figure out if it spread to the lymph nodes. That is what the biopsy was for. They probably biopsied the nodes too. I believe that stages 0-1 are without nodes having cancer and 2 up have node involvement. I wish you good luck and I hope it isn't cancer!"

First, make sure she has everything arranged for when she passes - then you have to do nothing. The executor of her estate, or perhaps a hospital social worker, can make all the necessary phone calls to put everything in motion. Second, tell her everything you never told her, because now is the right time - let's say you did something as a kid that you managed to cover up - tell her, it'll probably make her laugh.  Talk to her about things she never that that she might've wanted to do - maybe travel, or learn how to do something. It might sound cheesy, but maybe do some of these things after she passes, to help yourself feel closer to her."

Don't be hesitant with emotions, feel what you need to feel and express what you need to express.  Bottling it up is not a good idea.

cancer,3adlu9,HelloWorld1999,9,Fri Jun 19 06:45:55 2015 UTC,"You will not find a single cure for cancer. You have to understand that cancer is not one disease but thousands. Almost every cancer is unique in it's own pattern of mutations (point mutations or entire chromosome abnormalities).  Can you provide a source for your ""proven fact"" that animals can survive when presented with cancer? It sounds vague and like you got it from some dodgy website.  You also want to put this gene into humans, which is almost impossible to do. People have been trying to insert functional genes into diseased tissue for decades (Cystic fibrosis comes to mind first) and they've had only limited success. i.e. it works in labs in cells in plates, but not at any level higher than that yet.  Inserting genes into DNA without very accurate control of this, which is currently not yet possible at organism levels, is likely to cause further genetic instability.  What you have is a great script for a terrible sci-fi movie, but it's too far removed from the realities of research. Sorry!"

It sucks and there's nothing you could or should to make it not suck, because that's not possible.   First of all, do not beat yourself up for not feeling anything right now. It's an overwhelming time you're in right now. Everybody deals with this stuff differently, and yours is a bit of difference. Let yourself feel things in your own time.   Second, involve professionals as much as possible. When my dad passed, hospice care was there until we said it was okay for them to leave. They've been here consistently for weeks during my dad's decline and have been an immense help both in my dad's care and in our understanding of what he's going through.   If you have access to hospice, talk to them. If not, you need to reach out to a religious official, a mental health professional or counselor, nurse, or someone else. You have to be responsible for taking care of your own feelings. Others with experience will be able to best tell you how to manage your family's feelings.   If you want to talk, PM me please. It's necessary to hash things out in whatever way you can to make sense of the worse time of your life. Ask me any questions you'd like. I don't have a lot of answers, but I'm going through it right now too."

Common stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, acceptance. If you haven't manifested some grief after a couple weeks, you're probably still in denial (of the suffering in my case anyway, the weakness). Hang in there, I hate to say that, but really, do, for your sister and your mom. We survive, we don't get over it, but we do get through it.

Everyone grieves in their own way and that way can change as you age, especially because as you get older you will constantly put your father's passing in a perspective.  Try not to hold yourself accountable to some pre-conceived notion of how you're supposed to grieve. Understand that everyone in your family will experience this in different ways, most of which you cannot intellectualize your way to understanding.That dynamic also goes both ways.  My condolences for your loss. My thoughts are with you and your family."

cancer,3a8sba,Shogun_Marcus,3,Sun Jun 21 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"Ya know, I just kind of just settled into a new normal.  I describe my father's absence os a large emotional crater that will never be filled. Sometimes I find the need to visit that crater and reflect on my childhood or imagine an alternate timeline in which my father is still around. It took a few years for me to see it this way, but it hasn't changed for the last ten years.  Immediately after my father passed away I had faith (I wish I could describe the feeling differently) that he died for a reason and that everyone, including myself, had an opportunity to mature as people. I think that sentiment is what really got me through the initial months after his passing, and 12 years later it still does.  All that being said, you most-likely won't go back to what was normal. It's like a shock to the system and it will take some undetermined amount of time for the pieces to fall and reality to settle into a new pattern.   I think it's worth noting life is constantly settling into a new normal. People will come and go while the environment around you will always evolve. This experience can either make those transitions easier or harder and it will be up to you. For now and for some time, don't worry about all of that. Maybe come back and read this again in a year..."

Hopefully it will inspire you to eat but if it doesn't I personally like to send patients to buffets (as long as the smell isn't getting you) because often you will find at least one thing from the hundreds that you can sit down and eat a plate of and find at least remotely appetizing. This can get expensive but just reminding yourself that food can be satisfying can go a long way. Remember that ensure can be added anytime to supplement because losing weight is something you are also fighting against ATM. Let us know on the stage if you want to talk about it or seek information regarding your case as it relates to the staging :-)

Had a dinner try cpr on me. Wanted to punch him when I woke up. It was a tough surgery, 5 days in the hospital. Lots of pain but great team of doctors got me through. I started chemo 3 weeks after surgery. My wife is a chemo nurse and really help me through it. My boss was awesome, never told HR. I work through the chemo. I would have my chemo on Wednesday's. My boss would just let me ""work from home"" and I would go home with the chemo pump. I would work with the pump Thursday and Friday. My wife would take the pump off for me when it finished on Saturday. The chemo wasn't that bad. Never lost hair not that I had much. Some of the Fridays at work were rough and I'd sleep all Saturday and Sunday. By Monday I was back to myself. Met some amazing people at the cancer center.

cancer,3a76tf,preciouspudding,2,Thu Jun 18 00:06:56 2015 UTC,"I had the same thing 2 years ago too. My surgery was tougher than expected (tissue started to attach to my spleen so the surgeon spent some time ""scraping"") but they were still able to complete it laparoscopically. Surgery was Monday, I was discharged from the hospital Saturday. I was told before surgery ""you're not going home until you have a bowel movement"" but on Saturday a nurse gave me a bunch of stool softener and laxative and said ""okay, the doctor is kicking you out."" I think my insurance had something to do with that.  It was my first surgery as well so I was pretty freaked, even though I worked in a surgery center for 5 years. They can give you drugs to help with that! If you think anesthesia might make you nauseous, let the anesthesiologist know and they'll be proactive about that, too. I'd had twilight anesthesia before that made me a little sick (wisdom teeth removal and colonoscopy), and I made sure every doctor or nurse who walked in my pre-op room knew about it. Honestly, the weirdest feeling was (after sitting for 2+ hours in a recliner pre-op) being wheeled (for what felt like forever) in the recliner to the doors of the OR and told ""OK, just hop right up on the table here!""  There will be a lot of pain. If your surgery is laparoscopic you'll also have a lot of pain in your left shoulder from the gas. Get up and walking as soon as you can. You'll still be on a liquid diet for a little while, then moved up to soft foods, then eventually real food in the hospital. I had a follow up with my surgeon 10 days after, another surgery 3 1/2 weeks after (I had a port placed for chemo), and started chemo 5 weeks after surgery. I went back to work at 7 weeks (after my second chemo session) because I wanted to know how I'd react/feel after chemo.  I haven't had any big complications or issues. (well, other than cancer returning but that's not surgery's fault). My mediport caused more issues than my colon resection.  The only specific colorectal cancer fund I know of is http://www.ccalliance.org/bluenotefund/ I found it after I had finished treatment, but will likely be applying in the future as I have another surgery soon and will be chemo again later this summer...and I'm still paying for the first go-around.  Good luck to you! If you have any other questions let me know!"
cancer,3a76tf,psychmngr,2,Thu Jun 18 02:28:00 2015 UTC,I had the same surgery on March 2nd.  They couldn't find the tattoo marker where they were supposed to remove the section so they did a colonoscopy during the surgery.  Downside is they fill you with gas to do this and I ended up inpatient for four days waiting to fart out all the gas.  But I'm cancer free now.  I hope for the same for you.
cancer,3a76tf,SJhelix,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:24:34 2015 UTC,"Hope your surgery went well!  I noticed that you were tested for FAP. There are 2 genes linked, so ask to confirm you were tested for APC and MUTYH (formerly called MYH). Also, if you've had fewer than 20 polyps, testing for Lynch syndrome (5 genes) or other causes of polyposis, may be appropriate given your young age at diagnosis. PM me, if you'd like."
cancer,3a76tf,SJhelix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:34:30 2015 UTC,"Hey. Thanks a lot. Yeah, recovery is a bit slower than I had anticipated, but it's getting a little better each day. My surgery actually went really well apparently. No leakage. No need for a temporary colostomy. The tissues that they tested all showed that it hadn't spread so I shouldn't require chemo. But this has definitely been an experience. I've never gone through anything like this before and, I'm not sure what I expected, but it's been hard.  Had a couple scares where it felt like nothing would go down and my stomach got super bloated and I ended up puking like seven times and it was the most excruciating pain I've ever felt in my life. But I felt pretty great the next day. And I'm a little worried that I might have a hernia forming where they stuck the tube in for my pain-juice ball I had in the hospital. Feels like an inch wide bump surrounding where they pulled the tube out. But who knows. Other than that, all is well. I still can't stand or walk for more than. A few minutes before the pain getting so bad that I have to squat or sit down. But I'm seeing slight improvements day by day.  Anyway, about the genetic testing, I'm pretty sure I got tested for that other stuff you mentioned. Here's a pic I took from the booklet.  http://i.imgur.com/5PoBzPU.jpg  The only thing that came back positive was for some abnormal gene that put me at risk for prostrate cancer and it recommended getting it checked out at age 45."

I think you have your cart before the horse here. An abnormality on an xray could be lots of things. He may have an infection of some kind. Often, minor fungal or bacterial infections can cause what are called granulomas in the lungs. These are a bunch of your immune cells that wall off an area of infection. They can show up as spots on an x-ray.  I definitely don't want to be insensitive. I completely understand why you're freaking out and scared. But, your dad doesn't seem to have any risk factors that would indicate lung cancer, and like I said, a spot on an x-ray is a long way from being cancer."

Everyone around me has been telling me I am worrying too much, but when I hear people toss around the word ""shadow"" and ""lung"" in the same sentence, I hop aboard the panic express. It also doesn't make me feel better when he starts talking about how he shouldn't have gotten rid of his cancer life insurance policy or whatever and then goes on to reminisce about how he breathed in a lot of saw dust and fumes growing up and working in a furniture business. It's like it breathes life into the idea that it might actually be bad."

The upper right region appears to have what the Dr. called a ""ground glass"" affect/look and that it isn't lung related as much as possibly pulmonary related, but could be nothing too.

The chances of not just survival, but a chance at really LIVING is dependent HEAVILY on the attitude of the patient, but also HEAVILY on the attitude, support and prayers of their family and close friends.  His attitude can subtly cause distress, and that he should focus on every chance she has, not on being negative.  Furthermore, since I'm in the very middle of it, I see how MANY new medications, diagnoses, and techniques that have become available in just the last few years (I have a rare, incurable bone cancer, and I'm chemo'ing just to ""maintain"" until something better comes along).  Any time now they will have a WHOLE new approach to your mother's cancer, and her chances are better now than ever."

I cried like shit the night before he was cremated (wasn't there for his decline and death), sobbing asking my partner where he had gone (I'm not religious), him going over and over again, I'm so sorry, he's not anywhere anymore.   Ever since then, I don't feel it mostly, I'm pretty chipper most of the time,  I even make morbid jokes about it (like when co-workers said how did you convince the boss to let you do that, I went ""easy, have your dad die of cancer!). But every once in a while something will bring me the fuck back and I'll burst into tears out of nowhere. Watching the London marathon in a really good mood with friends, unexpectedly noticing how loads of people had CANCER printed on their chest because they were raising money for a cancer charity. Noticing on the tube a poster for a yearly event that happened last year around the time when my dad got diagnosed late stage bile duct cancer. Last week, watching a tv show where the character's dad died suddenly but the character wasn't close to his dad and wasn't outwardly showing it, him just going about his jovial dickish bro life and suddenly bursting into tears in the shower. It's exactly like that.   I guess it's good coping if were not in pieces after a thing like that. When people ask how my Mum is coping I feel dishonest saying good or bad. I just want to save up old videos of him and all his emails, so I don't forget."

cancer,3a4oyt,Mtthrowaway11,3,Wed Jun 17 05:12:20 2015 UTC,"Be there to listen and talk if they (your SO or the cancer patient) need it. Don't always assume you have to/should talk about cancer; sometimes I wanna rant about this crap, but sometimes it's nice to be able to chat about anything but.   Please, please don't cry in front of the patient, or slowly cut yourself off from their life. There's nothing more uncomfortable than when people act like I'm already dead. And please don't talk about anyone you knew who died of cancer...that's not reassuring at all. If I want to talk about my impending death, I'll bring it up. Conversely, don't talk about ""when they get better"". It's fine if you want to be optimistic, but for me it's kinda depressing when people say shit like that because it reminds me that I am in fact dying and the doctors told me there is no cure for my cancer.   Try to refrain from being helpful by suggesting healing remedies. Your heart's in the right place, and they may recognize this and appreciate your efforts, but chances are they have been or are being bombarded with remedy suggestions from lots and lots of other people.   Similarly, please don't force your religion on anyone. You have every right to believe God/Jesus/Flying Spaghetti Monster will save them, but if they don't bring it up then they probably don't wanna hear it. Some people turn to religion to help them deal with the big C, but some of us are perfectly fine without it.  Definitely do offer specific things. Like if you know s/he has chemotherapy on Monday, offer to drive them. If your SO is busy caring for the patient and still crazy busy with work and other obligations, offer to bring over a meal or two.   I think the best thing my loved ones have done for me is simply to be there. The stuff I advised you not to do does drive me crazy, but I know their hearts are in the right place and I don't stay irritated at them for it. It's a lot more important to me that I get to see them, talk to them, and be with them because I know I most likely have a lot less time left than I expected."

Unfortunately the patients condition is rapidly deteriorating and she (patient) is extremely depressed and seemingly has lost the will to live. Everyone is in shock because she went from feeling slightly I'll to being diagnosed with a late stage aggressive cancer and is now in the hospital(renal failure) all within 2 weeks... there are plans for chemotherapy but they cannot start until her current condition improves."

A more aggressive treatment than she had earlier this year. My BIL warned me that it could get bad & for 2-3 days following treatments she's not to be alone.  I'm going to be staying with her on Sunday because hubby has to work. I wasn't able to be with her as often as I should have the first time, but I'll do whatever I can to lighten the load for them now. I have to admit I'd ostracized myself from her because I thought she didn't need me,  now I know how wrong I was. Also, I was afraid & finding my courage has been difficult....but I've come to believe the struggles we have overcome in life give us strength we never expected we'd need. I'm counting on that strength in the days, weeks & months ahead;  hoping I have some to spare for her husband & son to draw from as well."

It's not easy, seeing someone go through this crap--when my friend was diagnosed with leukemia, I'll admit I really didn't want to visit her in the hospital. It was hard for me to be brave for her, and it was awkward trying to think of what I should and shouldn't say. Now that I'm on the other side of the situation I know that just having your loved one(s) present means so much. I hope your sister has a better experience with chemo this time around."

Say to them that you aren't familiar with the term and what precisely do they mean.  A patient that is snowed is drowsy, may be sleepy and confused (in an altered state of consciousness). In this case probably because of medications for pain, breathlessness or anxiety.  Just like you said sometimes family members and patients have to choose between being more alert but in pain, vs drowsy but comfortable.  Many people would choose drowsy/sleeping but comfortable.  Again, these aren't precise terms so if they staff aren't explaining things fully, ask them to sit with you and your mom and try again"

As he got sicker, and sicker, they increased his pain medication more and more, and he was getting groggier and groggier.  This happened gradually over the last few weeks.  But it got to the point where my dad was totally asleep the last 2 days of his life.  I didn't realize it was going to happen like that.  I didn't realize the last time I spoke to him was the last time I would ever speak to him (it was 2 or 3 days before he died).  It was brutal for me to realize that he was basically gone to me, even though he was still breathing.    He was comfortable and not in pain, which absolutely was the most important thing to my family, but I didn't realize that that would involve ""losing him"" sooner.    Maybe it's not always like that, but that was my experience."

cancer,3a4sh9,ahhh_ennui,2,Thu Jun 18 05:01:31 2015 UTC,"My mother passed away from leukemia in January.  Her cancer was more advanced than originally thought, so what was supposed to be a short hospital stay ended up being the last place she ever went. The doctors gave her anywhere from an hour to a few days to live and asked my father if he would like to look into hospice options.  Unfortunately my mother was too sick to be moved, which meant she stayed at the hospital, which meant she still had daily blood drawings, temperature readings, etc. Basically, she was uncomfortable and often in pain until the moment she died.  A hospice, however, would have continued to give her medical care, but the focus would have been on making sure she was comfortable in her final days. Personally I wish my mother had gone to a hospice, but she was too sick.  I'm not entirely sure what ""snowy"" means, and I don't know what you or your loved ones are thinking, but generally hospice workers are very accommodating. If you have more questions I highly recommend you get back in touch with them so they can give you a better definition of what their care would entail.  I hope this helps in some way, and I wish the best for you and your loved ones."

At first really sad and upset, then I got optimistic, and then I crashed again and was angry about having to in for more procedures and tests constantly.    The feelings of sickness and fear do go away.  It takes time, but you slowly will return to your old self.  For the longest time, I no longer cared about minor things.  The news for example was pointless.  Pointless stories about saving cats from trees.  All the while I could't stand the anxiety of having cancer.     It goes away though.  Use this time to learn more about yourself and be who you want to be.  Many people in this life never get the opportunity to ""restart"" their life so to speak.  Many are waiting for a moment/deciding factor, so that they can change who they are into who they want to be.  You have that power and opportunity.

It will get easier because we have a great capacity to adapt.  You'll recover your cheerfulness. It sounds like your concern about your exterior is a concern about not letting your loved ones become upset. I have specific worries that can start to weigh me down.  This feeding tube that will be down my nose, for instance.  I was assured today that the irritation with that will just be an initial reaction and it will perhaps almost seem normal.  There are lots of things that scare me when I've got too much time to think. This is probably a good forum to review (though it's upset me since I got the nerve to visit /r/cancer.)  I wish you the best.  My operation is on Tuesday.  I'm in my early 50's…not as upset as I would have been 10 years ago I admit.  Are you in much pain?  For some reason I have good and bad days with pain. I just want to be like my dad.  He kept up that carefree exterior somehow for three years.  So far,  I'm surprised at myself.

Taking it too long causes problems also.  The side effects are just impossible to bear after a while.  Breaks help the patient build some strength and gain some weight for the next round.  I wouldn't beat myself up for stopping treatment temporarially.  I'm sure you've looked up the prognosis of metastatic colorectal cancer.  He needs to feel better when he can.  On the hospice topic...  These are some wonderful people.  When/If he decides that he doesn't want any more curative treatment, and just wants to have his symptoms treated, that is second you call hospice.  We waited too long, and I wouldn't make that mistake again.  My advice would be to do what you can for him and your mother.  Don't wait on them to ask for it.  Text, email and call just to let them know you are thinking about them.  Send cards and flowers.  If you live close, take them a meal, do their laundry, stay up with your mom and talk/watch a movie.  Facetime her if you are not close enough.  People won't ask for help, because they don't know what to ask for.  Your mom needs to spend time with him, and not worry herself about doing laundry, cooking meals, cleaning the house.  Try to take a lot of that burden from her either through friends, hired help, or whatever.  She needs energy to support him.  Someone on Reddit suggested a company called ""HomeInstead"" to me.  I wish I had engaged them sooner too.  They do whatever you need (shopping, cooking, cleaning, laundry, errands, personal care, etc...) for a very reasonable price for families in this situation.  They say they are ""senior care"".  Don't let that bother you.  They help people in this situation also.  I could talk more, but I'm rambling now.

But it is scary and frustrating. Is there any kind of support group you and/or he and/or your mom could go to? We've been going to one at our local hospital (where we're welcome even though his treatment has been elsewhere) and it's been awesome. My husband agrees, and he's very much not a ""group"" kind of guy (unless the group is going to a baseball game or drinking single malt).   Taking breaks from the chemo is especially scary; sometimes there seems to be no good course of action. At some point hospice may be best; he can (usually) get hospice care wherever he is - home, hospital, nursing home - and the people who do hospice are wonderful. And you don't have to wait until the last minute; my husband had a friend who was in hospice, improved enough to get out, spent the better part of a year traveling around the country visiting all his friends, until he finally wound up back in hospice.   Good luck, and do keep us posted."
cancer,3a1nz5,Mjaxelrod,2,Tue Jun 16 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"Recommendations depend somewhat on whether it's an autologous or allogeneic transplant. Autologous are much easier, not just from the treatment side but also from the social side - there's no donor search which can be incredibly stressful. The conditioning regimen she'll undergo will also impact recommendations. I had an allogeneic transplant in Feb 2013, so feel free to PM if you'd like."

cancer,3a1p1t,lucky_ducker,2,Tue Jun 16 17:21:21 2015 UTC,"Let them help you. A support system is vital when caring for someone with cancer - I also suggest looking into finding a caregiver service in your state - see if she can qualify for SSI/medicaid if she does not work, and look into a visiting nurse service to help her, such as the excellent Visiting Nurse Service (I know they are in the NY/NJ area, and they are amazing) - sometimes states offer caregiver services, too.  If you don't like the medical decisions she has laid out in her living will, discuss them with her and her medical team along with your concerns about them. But... if one of them is that she wants a DNR, for example, perhaps have her elaborate the situations in which she would not want to be revived."

cancer,39z9tw,Seemingydandilions,3,Tue Jun 16 00:14:32 2015 UTC,"I have breast cancer, I'm three weeks out from having a double mastectomy. I have small breasts too and felt a lump, waited more months than I should have to get it looked at. My doctor said she never felt a cancerous lump like I had, so not to worry, she sent me for an ultrasound just 'to be safe'. Radiologist said the same thing and sent me for a mammogram. Radiologist said that it didn't look like a cancer he had ever seen so not to worry, but let's get a biopsy 'just in case'. Came back cancerous. Doctors never should have told me it was nothing because I was blind sided, they had me convinced it was fibroidal and not a cancer tumor. So maybe your doctors are being cautious by not giving false hope, you need to be told what the potentials are.  Learned I had cancer on Friday and on Monday I met with with a surgeon. She told me all my options and what she recommended. I could have gone with a lumpectomy and just had the tumor removed but I opted for the double mastectomy based on my type of cancer, my family history, all my factors. Yours will be unique to you and you will have to weigh your options. (Not to say you have cancer, but to at least remove the lump) That surgeon sent me straight to a plastic surgeon to talk about reconstructive options. Later I met with oncology to talk about chemo and radiation options. It was still not determined if I needed either or not but I learned about both.  I also met with a geneticist to do a BRACA test, with your family history you should do it too. I was positive for a BRACA mutation so that means I'm high risk for other kinds of cancers. Also my tumor was fed by hormones so I have to turn mine off. I'll be getting my ovaries and Fallopian tubes out after my chemo and radiation (I need both). This is okay for me because I've already had all the children I am going to have. You can still go on to have children after breast cancer treatment but I don't know all the specifics since I didn't entertain the option. But all the doctors asked me about my desire to become pregnant in the future so it's something they take into consideration.  As far as processing, it's been hard. I still find myself in shock sometimes. After a mastectomy your nipples pretty much die and melt off while the new vascular system grows inside so looking at my nipples grosses me out on a daily basis.  I have a super great family and support system, and my employer is awesome, I have great insurance... I sit and wonder how single moms get through, or the under insured. Or someone who has a demanding job, cause with all my blessings I still find it hard everyday to cope. I'm exhausted. I'm terrified. I start chemo in a few weeks then will have to do radiation then the other surgeries, reconstruction and the hysterectomy. For me it's been a lot. I think I'm worst case scenario.  I met someone who had a double mastectomy two days after me and that's all she needs to do. She's done. Her cancer is not aggressive nor hormone driven. She could have just had the lump removed but opted to play it safe and have a double mastectomy.  Then there are lots of cases in between.  Sorry, this might be too much and totally not helpful. I don't think I meant to write this much..."
cancer,39z9tw,fliggerish,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:40:03 2015 UTC,"No, this was definitely helpful. How do you feel about having the mastectomy? Do you think you'd go in for implants or come to terms with how they look?  It might be dumb, but I feel terrified to lose mine. They're not all that great to begin with but I've finally come to that ""you know what, they're boobs and they're awesome"" term, and now I feel like I'm on the verge of losing them. It's like finally gaining body confidence and having something tear it all away. Like I know I should just be happy to not be dying but I don't know. From what I know most chemo (?) kills your chances of having kids. Someone posted a link to a place that can offer discounts for egg freezing and stuff. Hopefully I can get into it. Otherwise I guess I'm having a child now! (Kidding, kidding). Thank you so much for your feedback. I really appreciate it."
cancer,39z9tw,fliggerish,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:06:22 2015 UTC,"I'm geared for implants. When they removed the breast tissue they put in spacers under the muscle before they closed me up. The idea is to add fluid to the spacers over time until I reach the size that I want. After chemo and radiation Ill have the reconstruction surgery and the spacers will be removed and the implants put it.  Sometimes radiation will cause the body to reject the implant, so I'm prepared for that.  For me it's not that big of a deal. I've had one child, breastfed, and otherwise have no attachment to my breasts. Initially I wasn't even going to get implants but others talked me into it thinking I would regret it down the road. Everyone is different though, if that is what is important to you the doctors will go over reconstruction options.  I'm sorry about the fertility issue you have to address. It's so hard to think of all of that now -you're so young. There is so much information out there on your options, I hope you find something that fits your wants/needs.  Have you heard back about your lump?  Thinking of you."
cancer,39z9tw,fliggerish,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"I can see that. If I had already done everything i wanted to do with them, I probably wouldn't care much. I wasn't too keen on breastfeeding but now it's not even an option. Thank you so much. I'm defiantly checking out all my options.  I won't move forward on anything until Friday when I have my MRI, and then Tuesday when we go over the results with the surgeon (and probably end up having a biopsy) did you have a biopsy? Was it painful? I'm like deadly afraid of needles, specially after I got my blood drawn last week and it left me with a massive disgusting bruise, I can't even imagine what a biopsy needle would do haha."
cancer,39z9tw,sneeze042,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:38:56 2015 UTC,"Oh friend, you need to do some deep breathing and meditation over needles. I disliked them myself and have had to come to terms with them quickly during this process.  It seems like I am getting an IV or blood drawn every other day... Though this has slowed down as of late, but it was crazy there for a while.  I've had several biopsies. If you don't like needles, bring something that comforts you, childhood blanket, stuffed animal, something. I found that I was nervous and needed to hold something with my hands but I only had the blankets.  For my biopsies I couldn't have anyone back with me... You have to put your arm over your head (the tumor side) and lay on the other side. They use a small needle to numb you then use a larger needle to biopsy you. To reduce freaking out just close your eyes and don't look at the biopsy needle. You will feel pressure, like at the dentist, but that wasn't bad. When they take the sample it clicks and is kinda scary but they should warn you so you don't jump.  I was able to watch the ultrasound screen if I wanted ...I shouldn't have because you can see the needle so well. I suggest you hold your source of comfort and close your eyes and muster up as much bravery as possible. It's fairly quick. You'll get through it. You have to right? So just be determined to go with the flow and not panic.  Yes it hurt mildly. The breast biopsy wasn't as bad as the lymph node biopsies I had to have. Those are higher up and because I'm thin, hurts more (I guess). Plus I had nerve damage after the first lymph node biopsy, but it went away over time.  I have been from one appointment to another. Breast MRI, CT/PET scan, 3 biopsies, lots of blood tests, genetic test, mammograms, ultra sounds, double mastectomy, and a port put in for chemo. Most appointments had a needle involved for an IV or blood draw. I've have to just let go of my fear of needles. Not to say I don't still tear up, but I no longer pull my arm away or have to be held down. 😉  You do what you have to do, you will find you are braver than you thought. I just wonder how children go through this process, and if they can get through it, so can I. So can you.  Keep us posted on your progress!"
cancer,39z9tw,bros402,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:18:06 2015 UTC,"Oh my, that's insane! I couldn't imagine doing 3 biopsy. Kudos to you. That's a whole lot of needles. I remember just a week before I found this out, I went to the dentist for the first time and they shoved those needles into my gums without a warning. I was like ""thank god these are the last needles I'll need till I get braces!"".  I'll definitely bring something of comfort. For the MRI tomorrow (I'm lucky, super claustrophobic) I'm having my boyfriend go back with me, so he can at least put his hand on my foot or something. As odd as it sounds I guess it worked for my mom. It's going to be sucky to not have him back with me for the biopsy. He's pretty much been my main source of support. The lymph node thing sounds horrible, I'm so sorry! Was the nerve damage a set back? I wonder if I'll have to go through a mammogram. Last i heard my insurance doesn't cover it, so I hope they find what they need through these few tests. I haven't seen my blood test results since they didn't have them when I saw my pediatrician, and since all of this they suggested I start seeing an adult doctor or family doctor, so I have no clue when I'll see them. Did the blood results give any answers to the cancer suspicion?  That's definitely true. Thank you so much, for listening and answering everything I ask. I really appreciate it and it helps a lot.   Also sorry for all the spelling mistakes. My phone screen is completely shattered so I can't see most of the words properly haha."
cancer,39z9tw,pdmishh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:51:46 2015 UTC,If they already did an ultrasound they probably won't do a mammogram. Mammograms are probably not covered for someone your age to have willy nilly but your doctor will code it correctly if it is needed to rule out a cancer diagnosis. There are different codes for different reasons. I will be thinking of you!

If it is cancer, I heavily suggest you look into fertility preservation options, as things move... scarily quick once you get a diagnosis.''  I am a guy, was diagnosed on May 18th, and my doctor told me to look into fertility preservation options before starting chemo on the 28th, as my regimen can render me sterile.  I would suggest talking to someone at Livestrong, even if just to have SOMEONE to talk to - they are great there. They also offer a program which has discounts for embryo storage & preservation - as long as your parents earn under a certain threshold (I want to say $90,000) per year, you can qualify for it. If they earn over that, contact them anyway and use them as a resource to talk to.  Here is a link to their fertility program - http://www.livestrong.org/we-can-help/fertility-services/fertility-women/"
cancer,39z9tw,dogsandpeaceohmy,2,Tue Jun 16 13:22:53 2015 UTC,"Good thing to mention...I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year at 22 and livestrong paid for my fertility preservation (egg freezing), medication and all (the entire procedure is about $23,000. We only had to pay $1,600 and my parents make more than the &$90,000 threshold) before chemo. So, OP,  if you are able to preserve your fertility, this is a great and helpful option. Best of luck :)"

cancer,39z9tw,dogsandpeaceohmy,2,Wed Jun 17 05:49:27 2015 UTC,"Hi, 21 year old here. I can relate to your situation so much right now, I actually specifically came to Reddit (it's my go-to as well) to read the experiences of others and talk with survivors. A lot of your questions are my questions as well. I want you to know you're not alone in this weird stage of not knowing what's going on, and if you're into having someone to talk to, you're 100% free to message me.  Two days ago I found a lump where my lower armpit/upper breast meet when I woke up. I also had very painful swelling under my left armpit and noticed my lympnode under my arm is very tender and swollen. I told my roommate about it and she suggested maybe it was an ingrown hair, but after calling my mom and having her look (a nurse for 30 years) she confirmed it was my lymph node and also confirmed the mass. My left breast has been sore even though I'm not menstrating (I'm on the pill.) I've been fatigued, which I contributed to working full-time and recently moving and finishing school for the semester, and lacking appetite (which I contributed to my summertime slump in appetite.) I've had a personal history of cysts developing (I had a group of them removed from my knee two years ago, as well as another one removed from my groin-area) and my grandmother just had a double mastectomy and survived breast cancer last year. My grandmother on my mom's side had both ovarian and breast cancer seven and ten years ago as well, and has also survived and been cancer free since. With these concerns in mind I made a doctor's appointment for tomorrow and will see what tomorrow brings. I obviously have not had the medical experiences you have had yet, so I am still wondering, maybe it's nothing, but this nagging, worried voice in the back of my mind is making me sick about it.  My worries are a lot like yours. I fear I may also lose my scholarship, or worse, what if I lose the job I love because I can't work or go to school? It almost feels silly, but I'm so attached to my hair too. My mom is a single mother who raised me and has no one else in the world if I'm gone, what about her? What if I don't make it? My mind just continues to wander, and I don't even have anything concrete yet. As far as coping goes, I think I'm in the same stage as you, just trying to figure out what's going on and trying to find others' stories and hardships so I'm not blindsided if this doesn't turn out to be ""just nothing.""   Sorry if I said too much, and also if I give off the impression I'm trying to take away from your post in any way. I will keep checking in here and hoping for the best news for you. Just know you have support from an online stranger, I suppose."

cancer,39wtm2,companycar,2,Mon Jun 15 14:51:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about your grandmother's case (and neither does anyone here) but it sounds like she did very well for a long time with incurable breast cancer. I hope she continues to respond to treatment and does well.  Again, I don't know about the specific followup schedule for your grandma, but drug holidays are not unusual. A good time to do this could be when there is no visible cancer like you said. Giving treatment may only be causing side effects at that time.   Blood work for tumour markers is not standard in breast cancer.  When the cancer cannot be cured, it will always come back at some time. Unfortunately it has always been stage IV since the first diagnosis. If you think about it, it will always recur between scans, whether those scans are 3 months apart or 12 months apart, and it still won't be curable. It may need treatment to help control it or relieve symptoms though.   The oncologist is judging how likely it is to be a problem within x amount of time- where is it, how aggressive is it, how fast is it growing, what else is going on with the patient, how anxiety provoking are the scans, how toxic is the treatment, how likely is the patient to call if they have new symptoms before the next scans..   So yes it could be reasonable in many cases  I hope this is a somewhat useful explanation. I am not a chemotherapy doctor but if you have other questions I can try to help"

There is no treatment out that will cure him. There may be some other agents he has not tried yet that may help prolong things, but anything would not be for very long.  If someone has not already made a referral for your father to meet with a Palliative Care doctor, I would ask for one. Your dad sounds like an awesome guy, a strong guy. He, and your mother, and you; all of you deserve to have him spend whatever remaining time he has in comfort and with dignity. He shouldn't have to live with pain and fear.

I'm not religious either, but my parents are...so it's an interesting dynamic being at home for in-home palliative care.  I don't know if this will help you and your family but my father told his priest this past week that he's not afraid of death and he's not in pain, what he is anxious about is not knowing how much longer he has or what his symptoms really mean.

cancer,39w5ox,lashyy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:09:07 2015 UTC,"Look into a compound called 3-Bromopyruvate.   It works as a glycolysis inhibitor. Cancer cells exhibit what is called the Warburg Effect - even in the presence of an abundance of Oxygen, they use anaerobic metabolism (glycolysis) to generate ATP (energy). Normal cells use oxidative phosphorylation - which is the use of oxygen in metabolism. This is how PET scans work. You are injected with glucose with a radioactive additive and the scan detects which areas of the body see a higher uptake of glucose. These are the cancerous areas. ~95% of cancers exhibit the Warburg Effect.   3BP is a lactic acid analogue, and lactic acid is the product of glycolysis so it enters cells which favour glycolytic metabolism and shuts down the energy production centres (mitochondria I believe). It would be harmful to normal cells but it appears to leave those alone due to normal cells' propensity towards the use of oxygen to generate ATP.  There have been several animal studies done (most notably by Dr. Peter Pederson and Dr. Young Ko of Johns Hopkins). In the first such study, I believe 19/19 rats were cured of extensive hepatocellular carcinoma and faced no recurrence.  There are very limited amounts of places offering the treatment but there is an okay deal of information online.  Here are two case reports of patients with extensive disease being treated very successfully with this treatment. Unfortunately, both died, but neither died of cancer (one only had about 5% liver function left after treatment and tumor lysis syndrome + antibiotics for an infection overloaded his liver; the second died of a chest infection resulting from a completely collapsed left lung):  Hepatocellular Carcinoma: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10863-012-9417-4  Metastatic Melanoma: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4110469/  I believe MD Anderson is extensively studying this for neuroblastoma. Johns Hopkins is also studying it. There are alternative clinics offering the treatment but at extremely expensive prices. I believe there are German clinics offering it too. The alternative clinics found to be offering it, to my knowledge are in Arizona, Georgia and Toronto.  It's way too early to say this is a cure but it shows promise.

cancer,39w5ox,SikhBromance,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:36:20 2015 UTC,"You'll have to be careful with it because as noted in the HCC case, people with large tumor burdens can experience what's called tumor lysis syndrome: whereby the quick onset of cancer cell apoptosis causes a release of certain chemicals by the tumors, which can overload organs. Your dad sounds like he has a large tumor burden. TLS is preventable and treatable as far as I know. Your care team just needs to be aware of it. Firstly, ask your oncologist about the treatment. There may be patients experimentally being treated with it that you are unaware of or they may be able to provide you more information. They're also well connected in the cancer community so they may be able to point you in the right direction in terms of being able to receive this treatment.  DISCLAIMER: I am not advocating any of these clinics as they are alternative clinics and not much is known about their procedures, etc. One of them has only been approved to give 3BP since December and they are claiming to have cured a Stage IV breast cancer patient already. There are no case reports so take it with a grain of salt.  I won't be providing links because it may be against board policy but you can easily find them from this info  Arizona: Dayspring Cancer Clinic (cost is roughly $28,000)  Toronto: Cancer Immunotherapy Centres (from people emailing them, cost looks to be around $400CAD 2-3x per week for 12 weeks) - they may only treat Canadian patients though.  Georgia: Advanced Rejuvenation Institute (unaware of cost).  There is a 125+ page thread on Cancer Compass titled ""anyone used 3-bromopyruvate"" or something similar. They're very helpful with it. Some people there have actually ordered the stuff online themselves and self administered as it is very cheap. Again, I'm not recommending this path, but if worse comes to worse, you have options and maybe a bit of hope. Any questions you have on the compound you can ask there.  There are a growing number of scientists who are treating cancer as a disease of cell metabolism as opposed to cellular mutation (ie. Cellular mutation is a by product which occurs when a cell's capacity to generate ATP aerobically is compromised). Since the genome type project has been an abject failure in showing which mutations cause cancer, and in some cases has identified cancers with 0 genetic mutations (there's a sample of glioma which has been found to contain none - these samples simply should not exist if the current theory on cancer is true). So attacking the impaired mitochondria - which is seen in every form of cancer - might be the new promising area for cancer research. Look into the presentation given by Dr. Peter Pederson if you are interested in this topic. He does a good job of explaining it and the 3-bromopyruvate compound, in a lecture style PowerPoint presentation."

cancer,39vlou,Unbereevablee_Asian,2,Mon Jun 15 04:02:28 2015 UTC,"my dad had cancer for 9 months before i lost him, so i know how daunting that time frame looks.   my best advice is to let him feel whatever he feels. let him be scared, grateful, angry, happy. make sure he cries, make sure he laughs, make sure he screams. he's going through so many emotions (maybe that he's afraid to show), so just make sure he can; and make sure you share yours with him too.   i agree with mafsto on his points, especially monitoring everything. i became an expert on my dad and could report objectively, which helped doctors and nurses do their job. i would report every thing he ate, drank, how much, what he did, when he felt good, when he felt bad, what caused either, when he was active, when he was too tired, etc, and they were able to suggest or alter his diet, activity, meds, etc, as necessary. there's a reason everyone calls it a ""team"" of doctors/support.  spend time with him. as much as possible. i put my entire life on hold for my dad and would do it again in a heartbeat, no matter how long. in those 9 months, i never once turned him down for plans and i rarely did anything away from home for more than half a day. i was at every chemo treatment, test, blood test, visit, scan, hospitalization - everything. every second. i don't regret it. i never will.   lastly, don't ignore yourself. let yourself feel whatever you're going to feel, also. don't be afraid to feel it or show it. be healthy. take care of yourself, too, not just for yourself (obviously important), but also so you can be there for your dad in his last time of need too.   best wishes."

cancer,39vlou,ILoveLucille,2,Wed Jun 17 01:34:47 2015 UTC,"I had to create an account just so I could give you an internet hug. My father was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer a year ago and was also told he had about a year to live. One year on, and several rounds of chemo later, and he's still fighting the good fight.   The most important advice I can give, is to take every day the two of you are given and make the most of it. Even if it is just simple things, like playing cards with your Dad or watching a movie, they're all moments that will mean a lot to both of you. There have been lots of ups and downs and even days where I swear my Dad didn't look like someone with cancer. There will also be days where you're so frustrated, scared and angry that you want to scream at the top of your lungs. It's ok to feel that way, it took me a long time to realize that. Just make sure you have your own support system in place and a healthy means of dealing with your emotions, it will help both you and your Dad.   It sounds silly, but keep treating your Dad as you did before his diagnosis, he just happens to have cancer now. My Dad, although willing to accept help when he needs it, gets annoyed when others assume he needs help without asking and treat him like an invalid. Offer your support, such as keeping him company for appointments or offering drives but don't push them on him.   Every family's journey with cancer is different. Get all the advice you can, from doctors and other families dealing with cancer as it will help prepare you for this journey. Look into support groups in your area for people dealing with cancer. I hope, despite the prognosis, that you have many good memories left to make with your Dad."
cancer,39vlou,Mafsto,2,Tue Jun 16 23:07:19 2015 UTC,thank you!  Hearing about your father gives me hope!  I wish him and your family the best and hope he recovers!! so far I'm trying to let him just do whatever it is he wants to get his mind off things.  his first appointment with a cancer specialist is this Friday amd hopefully we can get some more information.   sending back internet hugs to you and your father.   All the best!
cancer,39vlou,toostrongtoolong,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:41:04 2015 UTC,"Learn how to help take care of your father in a myriad of ways.  Whether it's just being good company or helping him in the bathroom, be prepared for anything.  What makes cancer hard to deal with is how it affects the rest of the body.  So monitor any small change in his mental and physical behavior.  If you see anything different from the norm, then let his doctors know.  NEVER hesitate to ask questions.  A good oncologist and doctor will field whatever question you have for them.  One thing I also need to stress to you.  Chemo can warp the brain.  Your father's thoughts can become fuzzy and his emotions can get nasty.  Try your best to get through whatever he throws at you.  Know that's not him, but probably a side effect from chemo."

The best advice we have for you is that you don't ever fully move on. The fear will always be there, it is how you and your husband deal with it on a daily basis that will define how you move forward. You need to recognize that cancer will play a part in your life no matter what happens from here on out.  That being said you need to accept that cancer will be there, but also understand that you both have been given...(I wouldn't call it a gift) but a perspective on how to live your life moving forward. Accept the fear (which is easier some days more than others) and try and live your life to the absolute fullest. I am taking the bar this summer (for California) though I am not cognitively ready, and in the fall I hope to kick my reproductive system back into gear and try and get pregnant. Yes I know that my husband and I both have/had cancer. Yes I know that our outlook isn't tinted through ""rose colored glasses.""

If you don't already talk to anyone I would really encourage you to seek out some kind of support whether it be through therapy, cancer-survivior support group, ect.

It was a huge shock for everyone and my family handled it super poorly because of this very reason, despite the fact that it was found early and there didn't appear to be any spread once I had it removed and my scans done.  It's going to suck the entire time.  Just remember that your mother is the patient and you should be attentive to her needs.  If she wants you to treat her the same, make sure you don't start looking at her differently or talking to her differently if you feel like you're doing it for her sake.  Definitely feel free to express yourself and talk about it with her if you think she is willing to talk about it to you, because that's definitely important.  But only do that if it's for your benefit and not because you're assuming it's what she needs.  No one inherently knows how to handle these conversations, and in my experience with my family, people tend to get this idea in their head that they need to be Superman or Wonder Woman for the cancer patient in their lives as if they're suddenly helpless or somehow lesser than they were the day before their diagnosis."

More tests than revealed it had metastatized from his pancreas and had even spread to a lung.  They gave him ""days to weeks"" to live.

cancer,39oodf,Balleuuh,3,Sat Jun 13 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss as well. I've been lurking here for the last 3 years until recently. A friend of mine died from this cancer but he fought it for 2+ years before he reached your dad's stage. My dad is going through (what to me appears to be) a drawn out process. He's not in pain though, just a lot of anxiety and weakness. I hope he goes quickly when he does."
cancer,39oodf,ThrowawayEOL,2,Sat Jun 13 16:42:10 2015 UTC,"Your ""caregiver/son"" flare resonates with me. I was caregiver/daughter for my dad. His extreme weakness and tiredness lasted a couple weeks, maybe two, but the anxiety didn't come until his last few hours. I hope your dad's process is easy and peaceful, for the both of you."
cancer,39oodf,toostrongtoolong,3,Tue Jun 16 21:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yesterday was the one year anniversary of my father's death to brain cancer. With what you said about the suffering, I'm glad that you acknowledge how much of a blessing that actually is and that you have the strength to find silver linings in an awful situation. I'm sorry that you had to experience this but happy that you have had an amazing father get you to where you are in life. I'm sure you make him proud today and will continue to make him proud with whatever you do in the future. Let me know if you need anything."
cancer,39oodf,falarma,2,Sun Jun 14 00:33:54 2015 UTC,"I too am very sorry for your loss. I lost my mother when I was only 12, it was very difficult to let go. Keep your memories close in the weeks & months to come. Peace & comfort to your family.   My surviving sisters have both have battled cancer, the oldest is ""cured"" of breast cancer, my younger sister has metastatic cervical cancer her battle has been ongoing for 6 months thus far. She starts palliative chemo next week."
cancer,39oodf,daelite,2,Mon Jun 15 01:34:00 2015 UTC,"I am also relieved, because his suffering was not drawn out, and he died very quickly tonight.   I lost mine from pancreatic cancer in November. We had 9 months, which is a lifetime for typical pancreatic cancer. When he passed, it was quickly. It was unexpected until just hours before. We recognized that he was experiencing terminal agitation and were able to sedate him. They said it could be a process of days, but it was only hours. While the shock of it being unexpected left me with a sense of PTSD, I'm so grateful the actual dying process was fast.   I'm glad you and your father (and family) received the same relief, and I hope you're all coping healthily."
cancer,39ocx6,Chocolate_Charizard,2,Sat Jun 13 05:26:50 2015 UTC,"Oh I feel you, so sorry you're going through this. I had radiation to my throat and couldn't swallow or eat for a couple weeks. Patience and knowing this eventually is going to end is really the only thing you can do. The mucous buildup got so bad at one point that I rented one of those mucous suckers from the hospital which helped tremendously. Also, not sure what it's called but IV nutrition and fluids is key to get some calories in."

cancer,39ocx6,UnholyUrine,2,Sat Jun 13 07:58:01 2015 UTC,"Speak to your therapist about this. They can refer you and give you advice.   The oncologist may be able to prescribe you some antibiotics/antifungal/corticosteroids, or some painkillers. Avoid commercial mouthwashes, as they may have alcohol. Avoid smoking and alcohol.  Try to eat small, frequent meals and have them liquid. Get a referral to a nutritionist to prescribe you some supplements. If things get really bad, you should consider getting a G-tube, as nutrition is extremely important.  Hope this helps."

cancer,39nrsn,egm03,3,Sat Jun 13 01:58:47 2015 UTC,I have found most cancer docs will not give a script for it.  Best to find a place that dispenses the drug and see the doc on site.  I found it helped some for me but I was using edibles.  Best of luck.

cancer,39nrsn,deathchimp,3,Sat Jun 13 05:21:58 2015 UTC,"Do you have any pot experience?  It isn't like prescription drugs, you can smoke too much to deal with if you aren't careful. Anyone just starting out should have someone with a bit of experience show them the ropes.  I would just say get the woman a joint or two, they are more foolproof than pipes or bongs for a beginner. Give her a taste and see if she likes it.   As far as the doctor, she is a grown up, she should just request it. Medical Marijuana isn't legal in my area but my doctor was more than happy to prescribe Marinol (THC pill). You aren't breaking the law taking the drug. She has a legitimate reason.   As to the quality of life, whenever I was seriously depressed, when I just couldn't deal with it for another minute, pot made me giggle. There's not another drug on planet earth that will do that.  Good Luck"

This is a treatment option as valid as any other one.   Tell them she is miserable and nauseous and not eating, that's why I got it.   I hope she gets what she needs and gets through this alright. I know what its like to have treatment drag on and on."

I would just want to use it if it would help her and I am trying to see how best to approach this with her doctor so that the doctor keeps an open mind and actually considers the request instead of treating it as pseudo science or something of the sorts. But thanks for your response nonetheless!
cancer,39nrsn,Bailie2,2,Sat Jun 13 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"I had medical marijuana prescribed to me after chemo caused some real issues with nausea and other stomach issues.  I ended up not getting it filled because my doctor gave me another prescription first and told me to get the marijuana if the first one didn't work.  (I live in Nevada)  I think because my doctor had gone through cancer herself she was more open to prescribe it.  That being said, your mom is ultimately driving the bus on her treatment.  She shouldn't have any qualms with discussing it with her doctor as a possible treatment for the side effects of  her treatment."
cancer,39nrsn,Bailie2,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:42:51 2015 UTC,"thank you for your response and congratulations on overcoming your illness. My mom was pretty open to discussing it with her doctor, although she did make a comment about not wanting to spend the rest of her life being high. So yea, I guess she's debating between whether she wants to do it or not."

It isn't live or die, its one of the shades in between. Treatment sucks regardless.   Her main activity for the foreseeable future is to wait and endure. If you want to help, help with that. Watch movies, play games, help her pas the time when she can't help herself.   Oh, and my advice is to get your ass off the internet. You can't help with the cancer, that is her doctors job, you aren't goint to happen on a magical cure on some forum. Just concentrate on being her nephew(niece?)."

I finally felt like it was time to celebrate on the first day I would have had chemo (I had it every other Wednesday) and didn't have to go to the hospital. Finally felt like that massive weight was off my shoulders. Hope you have that same glorious Wednesday feeling very soon! It's been a couple months and I STILL love Wednesdays.

cancer,39nrir,tallbooots,4,Sat Jun 13 01:56:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure I understand.   I've been a caretaker/advocate for a few cancer patients,  taking care of my brother with Chordoma (clivus chordoma - a rare cancer that affects the skull & brain).     I see your picture, but nothing else.    What kind of cancer, when diagnosed,  where do you live,  do you have insurance,  is your family ok,  was this picture recent or in better times,  is surgery or radiation or chemo in your past /future?    Lots of questions.     For me, I'd start out by searching for information on your particular kind of cancer.    See what the current standard of treatment is, and what outcomes are likely.    Adjust your diet and exercise if you can,  and make all those plans and documents to handle things in the event this goes horribly wrong. Take notes about your clinic/hospital visits, treatments, doctors.  Send thank you notes to the staff that makes you feel special - it helps them, too.   Make sure your insurer is paying for the best level of treatment you can get.   Experimental stuff is always going to be out of reach, but if you think it is wise, your doctor or others may be able to connect you with a paid study.      Talk to others with a similar situation.  Only by walking in those shoes can anyone truly approach ""knowing"" what you are going through.   We each have a different experience,  different hopes, different levels of tolerance for pain,  different levels of support from our friends and loved ones.     Good luck with whatever treatment you have ahead."

It's a big adjustment and it takes time to accept your new body.   This will take the front stage of her life for a long time. And it will never go away. It might move to the back burner but it will never be completely out of her mind.   She will never get back to her usual self. They call it the new normal. It's your new self after cancer.   Because of her age, I wonder if they did genetic testing. I am BRCA1+.   Does she have any other treatments planned?"
cancer,39jf8j,smellynat,3,Fri Jun 12 13:00:29 2015 UTC,I forgot to put in a note for you. Just be there for her. And don't take her mood swings personally. She's just trying to cope and heal.

Chemo? Radiation? My chemo didn't kill me, but it killed the cancer.  ""I can only do so much with that role."" It's a big role...support after surgery is so important. The girl of your dreams needs you and your mindset. Just don't bail on her when the road gets hard. Shared adversity is a bonding experience.  ""I'm praying that surgery goes well tomorrow. And that I have the courage to be strong for her.""  Praying and trusting in the Lord says you know that God is in the health care business... keep the faith, and trust in the medical support she gets.

If you know you are inheriting anything, maybe talk to him about what you are going to do after college - talk to him about maybe a trip you want to take after graduating college. Something to get him to focus on the future, even if he doesn't want to do chemo - gamma knife and radiation can help"

I was with him today and we were talking about how I plan to go to Italy again in January as part of my schools study abroad program. He knows how much I love traveling so I'm sure talking to him got his mind off everything. He has actually already started radiation for the brain, just not the lung. They do 10 days straight (he is on day 7), and then do scans in three months and decide where to go from there. Thankfully, side effects have been minimum so it makes me happy knowing he isnt feeling like he did when he went through chemo."

It weakened her spine and she now had a compression fracture from one of the tumors that is pressing up against her spine. She lost the ability to walk and also use the restroom on her own. She can still move her legs but they've lost a lot of muscle and the physical therapists said she won't be able to walk again. They're releasing her from the hospital to come home to my house. She's been in since April, a few days after Easter. She didn't know why they were releasing her from the hospital so early and I had to explain to her that the PT said that she isn't going to get any better so they're going to just let her come home. She didn't seem to be too phased by it but I'm sure it hurt her. I know she's worried, I'm worried, I also have a business and family to take care of and I'm just burning myself out.

cancer,39eio2,lostintheclouds12,9,Thu Jun 11 05:02:50 2015 UTC,I tried to prepare myself for my brother's passing as much as I could and let me tell you: there is no way to really prepare for something like that.  There is something called anticipatory grief(grieving before death happens) and I experienced quite a bit of that but nothing was even close to the full blown grief I felt watching his last breath and having to live without him.    I didn't experience all of the stages of grief- I got stuck on anger for a very long time. The one thing that helped calm me down was reminding myself that he was no longer suffering.  That was my only saving grace sometimes.
cancer,39eio2,ImaCheeseMonkey,7,Thu Jun 11 13:47:37 2015 UTC,"i would like to begin by saying, im sorry to hear the pain you are enduring. i would like to reassure you by saying, you will come out a stronger and better person through this, hopefully.   my fathers passed away in 2013 from oesophageal cancer. he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and underwent palliative chemo, which gave him some time. i was 17 at the time, and his main carer.    its been over a year now since he passed away, and in all honesty it does not get easier. however. you learn to deal with it. its very hard. everything reminds you of them. i am also currently at university, and continued going after his passing, as i knew my father would want me to carry on and not let his death stop me in succeeding.   here is a tip: whatever you are feeling. FEEL IT! if you want to cry, you listen to some sad music and cry your eyes out. rewatch old home videos when your ready. look through old pictures of your dad. do it. do whatever you want. if you want to be happy and smile, which you smile. do not feel guilty at all. feel whatever it is the fuck you want to feel.   please treasure these moments with your father. theyll be hard. but its all you have got. but do remember. anything can happen still. anything.   please do PM if you ever need to chat. and i wish you and your family the best OP."

Like someone else mentioned, I had a lot of anticipatory grieving when my dad died, and I feel like my grieving may have been delayed after his death.  The biggest thing I remember from my dads passing was how much I hated people forcing me to do things that I didn't want to do.  You may have an advantage in this situation because you're going to be able to relate more to your sister than my mom was able to relate to me, but really just try to get a feel for how your sister is handling things and be ready to adjust your actions based on that.  Unfortunately, there isn't really a cut and dry answer to this question but I'm also going to second the advice about watching to see if she withdraws... That was the biggest regret I had about my dads passing as well."
cancer,39eio2,cortcortkittycat,3,Thu Jun 11 23:36:13 2015 UTC,"My dad started palliative care in May as well: lung cancer. Weakness and lethargy and disorientation are setting in. The medications from hospice can contribute to this as well, because the primary goal is pain management, not consciousness management. I'm finding that they can overprescribe medication and it's up to the caregiver to adjust it after seeing how the person responds.  Dealing with everything and having things run more smoothly are different but related goals to have. You can't control how hard someone is hit by these things. Be there, do things with them, don't let the cancer consume the family.  What'll help a lot is to stay organized and ask for more help from palliative care. I made printouts for my mom and I to track the medication and the changes that are being made each week to adjust to the deteriorating condition of my father.  My dad hates loud noises now and just asks for quiet a lot. I don't know if that's what you're going through but that can be hard for a 10 year old. She may want to withdraw, but I know that, later in life most kids whose parent dies of cancer and withdraws wish they had been around more and had more conversations with their now deceased parent.  When you go back, if he's still fighting, he probably need intense care either in-home or at a hospice facility.  How has your sibling been coping so far?"

I can't relate to most of it (don't have children, or a wife, or testicles), but I wanted to comment on what I can relate to:   Please don't feel guilty about needing people to help you. Your loved ones care about you and even if it's inconvenient for them, I'm sure they're more than happy to do what they can to help. And don't be shy about asking people for help either...I'm still learning to do that myself, but I'm finally starting to understand that my loved ones want to help me and are happy to do so if I ask.   Just because you feel that your cancer's not as bad as others doesn't mean you should feel bad for worrying or posting about your cancer. Even the ""best"" type of cancer is still shitty to go through, and you deserve love and support just as much as the rest of us. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this, and especially sorry you felt/feel guilty about bringing it up with your loved ones because of your father in law's health issues. I hope your surgery goes well and you recover quickly!"
cancer,39ej7i,Wyntersun,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:14:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words.  I've always been independent. It's not a pride thing, or I think I'm better - I just hate making people feel obligated to do something. I'm happy to help people if they need me to, because I'm usually quite easygoing. But why bother someone when I'm perfectly capable of doing it myself?  Sure, in this case the hospital won't let me leave without an adult (I'm 31 and need an adult...), so I definitely need help... I'm just so used to not asking, that it's hard to acknowledge and avoid making excuses why I shouldn't ask."
cancer,39ej7i,Wyntersun,2,Thu Jun 11 22:18:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, I get exactly where you're coming from because I'm the same way. When I was going through my radiation treatments and had to rely on my mom to drive me everywhere, fetch things for me, and even prepare my food...I was absolutely miserable. But it was part of a learning experience: i gradually learned to accept that I matter too, and I deserve to have others take care of me sometimes, instead of it always being the other way around.   I read a book that said there are studies that actually show a strong correlation between people who get cancer and people with certain personality traits: they're nice to a fault, they always put others before themselves, and they're very sensitive to others' needs. If this describes you too, then you better start learning how to be selfish once in a while--trust me, people will understand :)"
cancer,39ej7i,mastagodzilla,2,Thu Jun 11 22:59:33 2015 UTC,Logically I know you're absolutely correct. I just know that being selfish is going to drive me bonkers...
cancer,39ej7i,GivAhuG,2,Fri Jun 12 05:53:40 2015 UTC,"I may not be able to help much, but perhaps answer any questions you might have about the process the best I can. Personally, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Testicular Cancer almost 10 months ago and since then had undergone two surgeries, a radical orchiectomy and a retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy, as well as 3 months of chemo therapy. To shed more light on the statistics of testicular cancer, I was given over a 90% chance of success during each stage of my treatments by my urologist and oncologist.  In terms of the orchiectomy, I opted to have the prosthetic testicle put in upon my urologist's recommendation. The prosthetic feels significantly harder and denser than the other in a way that I can only compare to a hard stress ball. While I was on the operating table right before my surgery, my urologist was able to show me the different prosthetics for me to feel and see and I would recommend that you could ask to do the same. However, after a month or two, the feel of the prosthetic should go away and feel normal again.  Feel free to PM me with any questions that I have not answered  or any venting you may need to do. Best of luck to you!"

I probably won't PM you, as it hits that ""bothering people who don't need you bothering them"" part of my brain...  From what I was told by the doctor (I've done zero research), the prostheses can cause more problems than it's worth. If I need chemo it might delay it, there are loads of warnings about what if this, what if that...  If I wake up one day and decide I do need it to feel normal in myself, I can get one put in. For now I want to get healthy. I feel that my testicles aren't really a part of my identity, like breasts are to a woman's sense of self (according to podcaster Andy Mcelfresh's wife).  Do you ever get used to people looking at your junk and talking about it? I've had very few relationships and now medical professionals that have seen my manhood outnumber those I've been in a relationship with 3 to 1..."

There were certain reactive cells ( PAX5, CD20, CD3, CD5, Bcl2, Ki67 scattered positive) but no definite large CD30's or CD15. They mentioned that there was scant material so that if the lymph node is suspicious they would recommend an excision biopsy. ENT said to keep an eye on it for now and my Onc agreed. If it changes or new symptoms appear they want to know. I think the FNA gave me just enough confidence to make it through the Bar and I figure if the lymph node is still there in August after I finish the Bar I'll be like, ""Let's pluck this mofo out!""

I'm 31 and have an almost certainly fatal type of cancer.   I somehow have clear scans and there is a chance I'll make it.   I am having periodic episodes of uncontrovertible anger.  I understand the anger is just a different emotion I can't deal with.   I might be fine and live a long life.   Shouldn't I be happy.   I'm worried I  might do something stupid.  .
cancer,39axp6,Balleuuh,9,Wed Jun 10 14:50:24 2015 UTC,"I know it's hard darling. Trust me, I know.  In a sense, I was just like you. Until I met my current boyfriend, his name is Luis. And he's perfect in every single way. I mean sure, we have our fights, and we argue but when we lay down at night we just fall into each others arms are talk about how much we love each other. We also apologize for everything we said earlier in the day. It was always this way, but when he got diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia it became of the utmost importance to constantly remind each other how much we love one another. Just in case.  It's hard because at 20, or 21, or 22 and 23, we should be doing things with our significant other, not fighting cancer. And the hardest part is seeing your loved one suffer so much.   My final conclusion is this.. If my boyfriend were to die tomorrow, I would be absolutely devastated. There's no hiding it. But, I would be perfectly content with the fact that I gave him every ounce of my love and he did too. That I gave him something most people spend their whole life looking for. That he would leave this world having loved someone, and was loved in return.   20% chance of survival, or 1%, take it. Hold on to your faith in her. But also, prepare yourself for the worst. And, darling, if she survives, ALL is the most curable of cancers!   Tonight, I'll think of y'all and I'll say some words of encouragement and I really hope all goes well with y'all.

cancer,39axp6,USNthrowawa,7,Wed Jun 10 21:07:16 2015 UTC,"Earlier today, on my lunch break of all times, I listened to Casimir Pulaski Day by Sufjan Stevens and teared up because it is such a sad, moving song about losing a lover to cancer.    I would be perfectly content with the fact that I gave him every ounce of my love and he did too. That I gave him something most people spend their whole life looking for. That he would leave this world having loved someone, and was loved in return.   This passage had the same affect on me. I often feel like my cancer was harder on my mother than it was on me, because physical pain has a much lower ceiling than emotional pain. I wish you and OP the best."
cancer,39axp6,_runningwithscissors,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:30:27 2015 UTC,"that song hurts in such a sad and beautiful way. Almost every song on his new album does too. I had no idea that Sufjan wrote it after losing his mother to cancer. I saw him play a show in LA last week... three days before going home and finding out my mom is stopping chemo for good. He didn't play Casimir Pulaski Day (I probably would have lost it) but there is so much sorrow in these new songs and they so perfectly express the anguish of losing someone this way. I have a feeling it's going to be a huge part in my healing process.    Sorry for the very off-topic response but I think many who already posted here made an important point that sometimes all you can do is just love someone your very hardest and eventually find peace in knowing you gave this person such a priceless gift.

One of the biggest takeaways I had from the personalized stories from diaries and such was that everyone has a breaking point. No matter how tough you are, you have a limit. It's so easy to pretend you don't in modern life, because you're never pushed close to that limit of sanity or endurance or tolerance.  Your boyfriend has been, and you got a glimpse of it.

The IV was day one and the pill was every day after for two weeks, then a 1week break and start again.  I coped quite well with it, some nausea, I found naturally brewed ginger beer was the best at keeping it at bay, even better than drugs. If you are going to try that get one with visible ginger sediment in it.  I actually worked through the Pe-liver treatment but I am a pretty stubborn person.  The pre-rectum treatment was the same pill, but a lower dose. And radiation on weekdays, weekends off.  Edit: I should mention that the radiation went for all of January and I was quite run down for 2+ months after. Apparently 11-12 weeks post-radiation is the sweet spot for cell death."

It could just be that the cancer itself is causing more fatigue. Plus, cancer and chemo is mentally exhausting, and patients get sad/depressed and don't want to do anything. What's his mood like?   My advice would be for you to encourage him to start moving around a little bit (as much as he can). Maybe a short walk (especially once the chest infection has cleared up) - increasing activity should increase his energy levels.   Is he pretty mobile for the most part? Has he spoken to his oncologist about outside resources like oncology rehab (not sure if you're in the U.S., but if you are, most hospitals have oncology rehab programs)?"
cancer,39abzw,bipboop,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:26:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. We're in the UK.  He's not really eating which isn't helping with the whole energy thing but he can move around just not particularly well. He's had nerve damage in his feet as a result of the chemo so it can be quite painful for him to walk about.

The main thing I suggest you consider is going to a major cancer hospital that specializes in your girlfriend's type of cancer. At least for a second opinion.  They should be able to do a CT scan to stage her from the start. A CT scan will show if it has spread to her lungs or liver.   Ask questions and read about your cancer and the latest treatments.   I went to a local gyn/onc for my cancer to start. The last time she had a patient with my cancer was 4 years prior. Her treatment suggestion was not the current norm, it was about a year old. MD Anderson (where I saw a doc who saw dozens of people with my cancer) suggested a different more recent protocol that had 20% better overall survival rate than the local gyn/onc.   It is worth getting a second opinion if you have a rare cancer!!"

Tomorrow is when we find out some numbers, hopefully. They don't know if they want to remove the mass because it's messing with her bladder and kidney or leave it and treat with radation or chemo for now. If they remove the mass now, to my knowledge, it would goof up the start of the radation/chemo treatment."

I'm 25 and I recently had my mom pick me up and drive me an hour and a half back home so I could accompany my dad to his oncology/chemo consultation. Between my brothers and I, we had written a list (always write it down - it's hard to remember, especially when the doctor is right in there with you, and the reality of ""this is actually happening"" can be overwhelming).  If you're just meeting with a doctor and not her specific oncologist, they might not have all the answers and you may need to get this information from the oncologist. When we met with the oncologist, I asked what stage he was in, where it had spread, the size of the tumor, what tests they were going to do, what treatment we should be looking at, duration, what the side effects may be, what side effects are considered ""normal"" vs emergency, what we can do to help (nutritionally and over the counter), and some people prefer not to know... but for those who do, you can ask about the prognosis."

Those are really good questions. And I'm going to use them. Thank you for them. This morning the gyno went to examine her and didn't get very far.

cancer,398uix,greenizz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"Oh my, that sounds horrible. I don't have any real answers, but speak to your doctors and tell them exactly this- that you feel like everything is so urgent that you're sent into a panic, and then boom- you maybe feel neglected for someone who has cancer. Also it may benefit you to have some mental health therapy as well as the physical treatment you're receiving. I'm not suggesting that it's all in your head or that it's your fault. On the contrary. However, a therapist may help you not feel so overwhelmed and help you find peace in your journey.   Best of luck."

cancer,398uix,DrLOV,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:36:18 2015 UTC,"The way I think about it is that it's a great sign that they can cancel and reschedule you. When I was first diagnosed, my oncologist's scheduler called me almost every day with new appointments for me. I had appointments with pre-surgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology, etc etc. Now that I'm clear, I get bumped because my oncologist will be in surgery. I'm OK with that. He can take care of some other patient.   My advice is if you can get a hold of a nurse and ask the questions, they can ask the doctor and get back to you. I used to ask things like ""am I clear for massage"" or ""do I need to keep taking this medication"". My oncologist's nurse would ask and get back to me in a day or less. I would recommend that if they're urgent problems."

cancer,398ddp,doveenigma13,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:09:51 2015 UTC,"I am not a Dr and certainly not an expert but I have melanoma and have studied it and get to have PET scans (yippee!).  I suspect PET scans would not be good at showing melanoma on the skin.  The reason I'm thinking this way is that the top layer of skin (epidermis) that is made up of basal cells, squamous cells and melanocytes does not have any blood vessels.  You have to get to the next layer down (the dermis) to get to a blood supply.  The way the PET scan works is that the stuff they injected into you is a sugar compound with radioactive markers.  Tumors take up the sugar at a higher rate than ""normal"" tissue because the cells are busy reproducing and they accumulate the radioactive markers.  When they stick you in the tube, these clumps of markers are what they see.  I'm just guessing here, but I wonder if a skin tumor may take longer to accumulate the markers and just be harder to pick up on a PET scan because it isn't fed by big beefy arteries. It has a bit of a constricted blood flow.   It's a good theory.  It's probably completely wrong, but I like it anyway."

And every time I wonder whether I should call my oncologist about it. But then I look at my temperature - is it normal? I look at my weight, at my exercise ability. If it was relapse, I know that those other symptoms would be there in addition to me feeling off. It helps me manage the fear of relapse. So far I've been lucky and there's been no explanation for those times I've felt off except for infection.    It's good that you listen to your body, and you can tell when something's brewing.

cancer,3992ja,PWNEDBYATHUMB,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:09:29 2015 UTC,"Uterine was benign. But they did remove her lymph nodes, I think as a precautionary measure.  She had radiation therapy. She is actually healthy enough (she's a certified yoga instructor) to do a trial of a new type of radiation therapy.  Never smoked. I think it is actual lung cancer. She had nodules in her lungs before she began radiation therapy that they didn't seem to be worried about. She had her biopsy last week to see what the nodules are like and they said it is indeed cancer.  I'm not sure if this answers your questions perfectly but that's what I know. My mom has been not so forthcoming with information up to this point because not only is she's actively trying to ""keep me from worrying too much"", she sometimes gets a little lost with technical language and she'll stop committing the language she hears to memory.

cancer,3992ja,PWNEDBYATHUMB,2,Wed Jun 10 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"The obvious question to ask the doctor is, ""what is it, and what stage is it at?""  From there, you can learn so much about your options and always call the doctor or oncology RN after the appointment, but that one I think you are on top of.  If it is benign, they may just go in and remove the affected areas, however, if it is malignant, then it may require resection and chemo or radiation based on what they believe it is.  Some of the other questions would be: 1) Can I get a second opinion?  If she hasn't, I would recommend it! 2) Is it operable or does it require chemo and/or radiation?  If it is operable, how much of my lung(s) would need to be removed? 3) What is recovery like? 4) How long will I be in the hospital or how long is treatment (maybe both)? 5) What is the survival rate? 6) Do I have alternate treatment options that have an increased survival rate? 7) Are there any side effects?  If they have to remove some of her lung, she may have decreased blood-oxygen levels and find it harder to exercise for long amounts of time (common). 8) How will my (her) life change? 9) Where can we get support?  Still a little vague, but there is great support available at www.lung.org which is the American Lung Association.  More specifically at http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/lung-cancer/getting-and-giving-support/.  They also have a hotline to call and get help/ask questions at 1-800-LUNGUSA.  I am a brain cancer patient, so things are a little different, but there is one universal idea: smiles, laughter, family and friends are the best medicine.  Cancer is a real pain in the ass for anyone effected.  Stay positive for your sanity and by you staying positive, she will be as well.  Finally, be readily available for her but give her space if she asks for it.  When shes ready, be there with a smile, a joke and ready to listen.  That's all I have for now, but if you have any specific questions for me, please feel free to ask.

Macrophage activaction syndrome hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH/histiocytosis X)  <-- Probably this one. Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (Rosai-dorfman disease)   I am not sure there is a definite category for LCH.  Its a histiocyte disorder, which is a bone marrow cell.  There are two camps: its either inflammation gone wrong (think: rheumatoid or crohn's) or it truly is malignant.  Regardless, if its multifocal, it gets treated with 2 agent chemotherapy, and a clinical trial should be offered, if he is eligible to enroll.  Yes its a difficult diagnosis to make, and yes the differential (all the things it could be) is large.    Yes, it is a disease, so yes it should be covered by insurance.  I am not sure its critical, or what defines critical... its not as critical as a major operation or induction chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant.

He actually isn't fitting into any of the normal parameters for a particular kind of histiocytosis. Just to give you a clue. His xanthomas started in 2012, then went away for almost a year before his lymph nodes went spastic last December and brought them back. I personally feel that it is most likely Erdheim-Chester, but am waiting for the Onc to decide hopefully by the end of this week.  The social worker is the only one that I haven't spoken to at the main campus for Memorial. I had started to put paperwork together at the satellite location with a social worker, but going to the main ""This is Downtown we are the big dogs, look next door to MD Anderson, and over here is Baylor"" was a little intimidating at first.

cancer,393hyg,ghostghoti,4,Tue Jun 9 00:10:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going to do my best here, since I was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (it turned out to be Myelodysplastic Syndrome) but it is treated the same way up to a point. 1.  Chemo/radiation/transplant.  Depends on the type and prognosis.  For people whose testing indicates a mutation that would result in a high level of it recurring, transplant is discussed at the start.  Otherwise, it is typically left as a last resort because it is a tough thing with many risks.  Radiation is usually done prior to transplant to completely ablate the marrow.  Chemo is the first line most of the time.  For me, the chemo wiped out all the cells, good and bad, and the mechanisms for making new ones, so transplant was a necessity. 2.  The radiation, not so much.  Anything you would be exposed to would be on the level of background as someone just around someone who actually had it.  The chemo on the other hand...you'll want to avoid sweat, or body fluids of someone who has undergone chemo for a few days after. 3.  Organ failure is usually the result of the treatment as opposed to the leukemia itself.  My kidneys are damaged from the chemo and all the antibiotics and other meds I was on.  Leukemia can contribute to organ failure because of lack of blood, internal bleeding possibilities, but usually does not. 4.  It depends on the type and stage, and other factors.  I was given an 85% chance at diagnosis, but after some complications and the correct diagnosis, plus infections, kidney damage, and just the amount of time I lived with no immune system that went down to 15%, but I did survive. 5.  Yes, it can.  Certain types.  They don't like to use the word cure in cancer, but it can be.  Many people become completely healthy after treatment.  Others, like me, may never be. 6.  Depends on the type, genetic factors, and other co-morbidities.  This cannot be answered without that information, and rates are not a good indicator of individual success anyway."
cancer,393hyg,passwordwas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"I hope you don't mind me saying that you're amazing. You probably get it all the time, and I hope it's not a rude thing to say, but I admire you getting through that. Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions, it helps to hear it from someone firsthand. Would you mind if I asked a little more based on your answers? If there's anything you can't or don't want to answer, I understand completely.   So does it start off with chemo, then radiation and transplant go hand in hand? If you don't mind me bluntly asking, at what point did radiation and transplant become a necessity? How were you feeling day-to-day at that time? I know avoiding bodily fluids from other people is kind of standard procedure anyways, but is there a specific reason to stay away from them from a person had chemo? Also, how did you feel after chemo sessions? So organs can be damaged, but transplanting might not be necessary? Is a transplant ever done during the treatment of leukemia, or is it too dangerous?   Also, this might be a bit personal, but how exactly did the progression go? Were you able to keep up normal activities and stuff for a while? Did chemo/leukemia make it more difficult to do certain things over time? How are you feeling now?  I do admit that a lot of my questions are to prepare myself for future conversations with my friend, but at the same time, I'm curious. I like to read and research a lot when I run up against something I don't know about. I just want to understand, for future reference. Thank you so much for humoring me and answering my questions!"
cancer,393hyg,passwordwas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:56:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, for ME (and that is key to remember because I had a certain type and had my own responses to treatment, this is how I will answer. 1.  The idea was to do induction chemo (5 days of 2 different types, IV) and be admitted for roughly 30 days while my blood counts were supposed to recover and then do 6 more rounds of consolidation chemo to keep the cancer away.  However...my blood counts never recovered.  I went completely aplastic and stayed that way, requiring transfusions all of the time.  I felt awful.  I got infections, and even got sepsis (4 times in total).  I languished in the hospital for 3 1/2 months before getting released only to get pneumonia and be readmitted for a month and a half until I was released just for the day to fly up to a bigger city for transplant.  I never had radiation because it is typically (for what they thought I had) used just before transplant to totally wipe out your bone marrow cells, but since I already had 0, we just had another round of chemo to make sure and then the transplant. 2.  Chemo, especially for leukemia is cytotoxic.  It kills fast growing cells (like cancer cells) but also blood cells, hair, mouth, and others.  It will also likely make someone unable to reproduce.  For a few days until it leaves their system, it is good to go as little contact as possible.  Even sweat can be enough to harm someone else.  After a few days though, they are completely safe.  After chemo, I was weak and tired.  It didn't hit me until a few days after the cycle. 3.  The transplants that are typically done for leukemia are either bone marrow or blood stem cell transplants.  Organ transplants aren't usually done for someone with cancer (in fact, you usually have to be cancer free for 5 years before they will put you on the list).  Organ failure can happen, and organ damage almost certainly will, but the doctors are pretty good at keeping it as minimal as possible and monitoring it.  My kidneys are not good at all, but I am not even to the point of needing dialysis.  Liver failure is big with bone marrow transplants, but they are doing better at keeping that at bay thanks to a very expensive medication that is actually a synthesized version of bear bile salts. So, long story short, this is a bit of my experiences for my type, but the types vary wildly.  That coach of the Indianapolis Colts got a type of Leukemia where he basically got some chemo and was able to coach very soon afterward.  Not everyone survives even that type, but the odds are pretty good. I will say this however, 18 if in otherwise good health, probably has a decent chance on the average."
cancer,393hyg,Draconan,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:51:37 2015 UTC,Body fluids are cytotoxic (they damage cells) for 24-48 hours after chemo.  I know that before my daughter was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia her liver and spleen were enlarged from the disease. That's probably what they mean by figuring it out from their organs. Though when she first went into the hospital they put her on hyperhydration as the dying lymphoblasts are hard on the kidneys.  I think they use radiation if it's found in the spine/brain or testes. I'm not sure as it wasn't found in hers and she doesn't have any respectively.
cancer,393hyg,pointywalrus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:53:05 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions:    1) Leukemia treatments vary based on type, genetics, age, and underlying health. They differ based on Chronic leukemia versus Acute leukemia. They also differ depending on the protocol used. You cannot really prognosticate how a person's treatment progresses because it really depends on that person's variant of leukemia responds. For /u/passwordwas, the development of myelodysplastic syndrome meant that there was no functioning bone marrow and he needed a transplant of viable marrow to replace the nonfunctioning marrow. However in other cases such as certain aggressive leukemias, transplants are used so that a new immune system will attack the leukemia.    2) As for avoiding fluids, really it's not that hard to do, and it's not like we become radioactive or anything like that. Don't come into contact with chemo pee or lick sweat and you'll be good. As for how one feels, again, that depends on the protocol being used to treat, the drugs, and that particular person's response.    3) Transplants are done with or without the leukemia being in molecular remission - as long as it's less than 5% of the total blasts, and is indicated in cases where the leukemia is aggressive and there is no hope for disease-free remission without. That happened in my case.    In general though, I honestly recommend not trying to pry too deeply into your friend's affairs. Do feel free to ask about her brother's treatment, do feel free to address the elephant in the room, but understand that she will tell you only what she's comfortable telling you. As she is an old friend you're reuniting with under the shadow of cancer, do not be surprised if the dynamic of your relationship is completely changed. She may not want to tell you this information, and that's completely within her right. Cancer is hard to talk about even with the closest of friends.     I wish her brother and his family the best of luck."
cancer,393hyg,billyvnilly,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:09:06 2015 UTC,"When are the different types of treatment used? I know chemo seems to be the standard, but she was talking about radiation or something. When does radiation become an option? When does bone marrow transplant become an option? Does you have to be bad off enough, or are all the options available from the start?     It depends on the leukemia: T-cell leukemia, B-cell leukemia (B-ALL, T-ALL), and then many types of myeloid leukemia (AML) ...everything would be slightly different depending on the type.  Generally, they would be risk stratified by age and molecular findings.  Then they'll receive chemotherapy based on that.  Radiation will only be done if its Cranial (Central nervous system) involvement or testicular involvement.   This could be a rude question, but is radiation dangerous to other people? Like, do you need to stay away from someone going through radiation?     no, but you should avoid them if you're having any sick symptoms, for their safety.   I read that leukemia is sometimes diagnosed through liver issues. Is organ failure a risk? If so, how common is it, and is it something that can be treated and recovered from during the fight against cancer?     Its not exactly liver issues, its problems with how your blood clots.  Or you may have heard of what happens when your leukemia cell count is so high it clogs the vessels and its basically stopping oxygen getting to the tissue.   Is leukemia the sort of thing that gets worse before it gets better? How bad off can someone get, yet still basically recover? How much can someone recover from that state?     Yes.  They will be very ill, very at risk for infection.  Recovery is very slow from the treatment.  That is presuming that the drugs kill off all the leukemic cells, which is frequent.   Can leukemia be cured, and the person become healthy again? Or are there lasting effects? Is it the sort of thing that only goes into remission and might come back?     It can be, but there will be lasting effects on the bone marrow and organs from treatment.   What exactly is the survival rate for a guy around 18 with leukemia?   This is very, very dependent on the leukemia, age, molecular findings, white count at diagnosis, and response after the initial chemotherapy."
cancer,393hyg,disposethis,2,Tue Jun 9 01:46:46 2015 UTC,"We rarely do radiation for CNS involvement anymore although it is still listed in the NCCN for ALL with CNS-3 disease I believe.

If you are like me you get lucky and all the markers come back normal.    He is no for a long ride, ALL is a two year treatment.  The first year is hell, chemo and Radiation it is no fun.  If test come back and things are not good you are looking at bone marrow transplant.  The good new is that most young people with ALL have a very good chance of recovery. Up in the 90% range, me I am at a 80% and I have been lucky.     2) You do not have much to worry about we do not get super powers, you will not want to have unprotected sex or roll around all sweaty.   3) Most of the time it is just a blood test, lots of people think they have mono  4) It will get bad, but it is better then dead as I like to say.  The type of treatment and complications is going to have a lot to do with recovery.  For me I am 45 days past finishing chemo and life is getting back to normal, it is slow but I was able to bike 22km on the weekend and swim 750m every 2nd day.  I plan to try to do a half Iron Man next year, but I have a long road ahead.  The treatment makes you put on pounds and the steroids have made me sore and stiff.   5) Yes, but you always run the risk of it coming back and you also have the higher risk from a secondary cancer.    6) Depends on the type, it is very survivable but the test will give more info.  Chances are that is what your friends family is holding out on telling people about the cancer till the test come back.  You can not hide leukaemia, Its two years and he will be very sick.  The chemo will kill his amun system every 21 days, so he will want to stay away from crowds and sick people.    Let your friend know about us, we are all very able to give feedback. 18  is a hard age, you are stuck between childerens hospital and adult care.  Some times ALL young people will get treatment at a kids hospital as they are the ones that see it all the time.    Hope this helps."
cancer,393hyg,boomdeeyada,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"Hi! I am familiar with Acute Lymphoblast (or sometimes called Lymphocytic) Leukemia.  I am answering these from that perspective, but keep in mind that the treatment and side effects vary greatly from type to type, and even greater from lots of other variables such as age, gender, white blood cell count upon diagnosis, presence of MRD, cytogenetics, etc.  Think of it like baking a cake. Some call for more sugar. Some call for less oil. Some call for an extra egg. There are lots of ""recipes"" for treatment. You have to find the one that works for you.   Chemo is the primary method of treatment. Chemo consists of about a dozen different drugs, given and different times and different dosages. Radiation is used when there is CNS involvement (leukemia in the spine or brain) or testicular involvement.  Bone marrow transplants are used when they either can't get the leukemia into remission OR they could get it into remission, but it came back (aka relapse.)   There are a couple other treatment options available, the most well-known is the CART19 trial, which is seeing some incredible successes. But these are experimental, which means they are effectively a ""last-ditch"" effort.  You have to exhaust all of the approved methods before being put on experimental meds.   2) You should stay away from their fluids, for sure. So no handling urine or blood.  Someone with more experience with radiation will have to answer this one for you.   3) Organ failure is a risk if either the leukemia gets out of control, or from the side effects of the chemotherapy.  One that is in the protocol for ALL is doxorubicin, which is called ""The Red Devil"" because of the damage it can does to the heart. Nearly all of them influence the liver and kidneys, and of course the digestive system as a whole.   4)  Yes and no.  ALL is typically very easy to get in remission. Some do it in as little as 8 days.  Most do it in the 29 days.  Some take considerably longer.  The key is, TO KEEP IT IN REMISSION.  That's why the protocol treatment is 3.5 years for boys. Leukemia cells hide in the body (often in the testicles for boys).  So if they were to stop treatment when remission is achieved, the leukemia cells would come back and come back stronger. So the most important thing to remember is that treatment is not a sprint to remission, it is a marathon.  There are many stages of treatment (if he was recently diagnosed, he is in INDUCTION right now, where they ""induce"" remission.)  Months 2-3 (roughly) are Consolidation.  Then Interim Maintenance, then depending on his protocol, the stages of treatment vary widely.   The treatment is divided into 2 main sections: Frontline treatment and Maintenance.  Frontline is far more intensive.  Maintenance is a whole lot of spinning plates to make sure labs are just right. Each have their own challenges. Neither I would consider ""easy"".  It's chemo every single day for years.    ""Cured"" is a tricky word.  You have to achieve 5 years of ""event-free"" survival before you are called cured.  Treatment is 3.5 years, so in a little less than a decade, you can be ""cured"" of leukemia. Remember, marathon.  But often, people start to find their new normal at some point in to maintenance therapy.  Then they find a new, new normal at the end of treatment.  Relapse rates for pediatric cases hover around 20% overall. It can come back in weeks. Or it can come back in 20 years.  Lasting effects can be neuropsychological/cognitive (learning), mental (PTSD is common), physical (we talked organs), and the higher risk of secondary cancer.  All of the chemo used to treat pediatric patients are carcinogens. They all cause cancer.    6)  It depends so much on the type. But remember that none of the leukemias are terminal upon diagnosis.  So none of the odds are 100% fatality. So even if the odds shake out to a 20% survival rate, that means that someone survives it, so why not him?    Some other advice:  Learn the language. Learn about counts, and ANC, and neutropenia.  Just having someone to talk to that doesn't require a 20 minute biology lesson is SO precious.  You're doing so great already!!!"

I'm sorry to hear about your dad's disease, but don't panic too early. The prognosis of kidney cancer depends a lot on how far it has progressed when it is found. There will be a series of different tests to find this out, also if there are already metastases. Just try to be calm and wait for the results, as you said, if the tumor hasn't spreaded yet there is a good chance it can be completely cured. And - living with one healthy kidney is no problem at all :)."

cancer,394a7i,Enraknews,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:53:23 2015 UTC,"Depending on their location (often close to important nerves), schwannomas can be difficult to remove completely with surgery. If your mom's tumor was not totally removed, it's possible that the small amount that remained continued to grow, which is why it ""came back.""   There is a malignant version of schwannoma called malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), which does commonly come back after complete removal. The doctors should be able to tell the difference between the two diseases, but since MPNST is rare, they may be less familiar with it. If the tumor keeps coming back despite being completely removed, this would be very unusual for a schwannoma. You might want to seek a second opinion, especially at a cancer specialty center."

I'm not very familiar with the CyberKnife specifically, but it is common for patients who are not good candidates for surgery to be treated with radiotherapy."
cancer,394a7i,OTN,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"If this is an MPNST, surgery alone is rarely curative- if the surgeons are able to get all the disease out they can see, you have to do radiation afterwards in order to prevent recurrence.   If the Schwannoma isn't resectable, then stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) can be very effective. The CyberKnife is one machine which can deliver such radiation, but there are others than can also work. If the CyberKnife is going to be available in your country in 1 month, I would see a radiation oncologist as soon as possible to talk about potentially using it to treat your mother.

I had some pain from my left shoulder that spanned to my arm pit. I ignored it mostly because i had dislocated that should a few months prior to the pain, and figured it was from that. Fast forward about 8 months.... we were christmas shopping, it was the week before Christmas, and the pain was undearable. My husband forced me to go to the er. They did all sorts of tests, then finally a ct that showed a mass. It was the size of my heart, right next to my heart and was pressing on my artery. They admitted me, and a day later biopsied it. I was sent home after the biopsy, but called a few days later to confirm that it was lymphoma. The oncologist did a PET scan, and we found out I was stage 2. I started treatment the day after christmas. All of my treatments were in the hospital due to it being a constant 5 day drip. I never got nausea from the chemo, bit i was really tired all the time. My last treatment ended april 26th.   In March my potassium dropped and I blacked out and had a seizure.  The week after my last treatment I ended up in the hospital with a fever that wouldnt break.   But here I am a month and a half later with a clean scan. They wont consider me in full remission until a year has past, but I am back to work, my hair is slowly growing in, and I feel great.

That alone gives them an opportunity to show that they love you regardless or to show that this is a potential big deal to them.

cancer,3902v3,ikidu,0,Mon Jun 8 10:06:08 2015 UTC,"Not cancer, but viral damage here.   If you are concerned about not producing viable sperm,  relax. Lots of people choose not to have children, and you can adopt if you really want to.     On the plus side, if you are sure there is no sperm, then you and your future partner might enjoy the lessened anxiety over children, and neither of you needs to worry about any birth control. Still practice safe sex until you have a monogamous relationship with a healthy partner.    Size isn't something terrible.  Anatomically, most women have the majority of nerves in the first inch or so.  Many women cannot orgasm from penetration alone, so other techniques will be useful anyhow.    Even if you have trouble performing, this is something that everyone encounters occasionally.  If you have damage that makes it fail most of the time, there are medical procedures that can help.    TL;DR :    It's not anything terrible. Stop overthinking it, because sex is supposed to be fun.  Find someone you like enough and trust enough, and if they feel the same just go for it.   Most of us make an awkward nervous mess the first couple of times."

They really made my joints hurt, so just a word of warning in case you have to have them.   If the CT showed nothing then that's a good sign. I had all sorts of aches and pains whilst going through chemo which made me horribly paranoid. Every tiny little ache I had made me think it was a new spread.

I usually bounce back around a week after chemo I know it can be different each time. The only concerning thing on the scan is that the remaining enlarged lymph node hasn't shrunk since May. My initial scan in February showed it at 3cm, the scan in May showed it at 1.2cm, it was still at 1.2cm last weekend. I'm optimistic that my AFP will be at zero when they check this week and the oncologist will just want to watch it instead of doing an RPLND (I'd have to travel to Indiana for that which is out of state and out of network). Either way, as long as there is no more chemo I'll be happy."
cancer,390pwn,PH916,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:31:32 2015 UTC,"Well that's good you don't need shots. Your WBC will just keep building and building now you're going to be finishing soon so you'll start to feel much better.  I could very well be wrong on this, but I think the threshold is 1cm so you're looking pretty close. My oncologist told me that it does take a while to shrink, hence them waiting a month after your last chemo session to do the CT scan. He also said that if it's close to the threshold they'll leave it a couple of months and scan again as it can continue to shrink. So fingers crossed that yours will keep shrinking!  I don't know what the size the tumour in my abdomen was, but it was crushing the kidney and main vein so I think it was fairly large. Mine didn't shrink completely so I had to have the RPLND. It's a massive op and I was rough for a week or so, but in all honesty I think it's easier to deal with than the chemo. But I hope that it doesn't come to that for you!

I remember trying to prepare myself for the worst before my doctors appointment and I read a forum post where a guy said his cancer and the removal was nothing more than a bad memory.  Without a doubt I can agree with him.  A quick observation before I continue, but its crazy how you had to wait days.  I was diagnosed by a radiologist in the early afternoon, an hour later I was already scheduled to meet with a urologist.  She then scheduled my surgery for the next afternoon, but not before I had a ct scan in the morning to see how far it spread.  Maybe just a testament to the US healthcare system if you have insurance.  Anyways, same thing as you, I had some pain and went to the doctor, only because I was traveling across the country soon and didn't want to deal with it. This was at the beginning of September 2013. He felt my testicle the pain was in and said it was probably Epididymitis.  A week later I'm in a bar in Hollywood taking a piss and feel my testicle and its very hard.  I had a sinking feeling right then that it was cancer.  Got back home, went to a different doctor, he said there could be different causes of my issue but an ultrasound would say whats really going on.  Go to the hospital and this hot 21 year old student gives me the ultrasound.  Then the tech who was supervising her comes in and goes over a few places.  Finally the radiologist comes in and gives me the bad news.   I had my Orchiectomy and had a prosthetic testicle implanted in the process. 2 weeks later had my sperm frozen at the hospital.  Had a CT guided biopsy on my lymph nodes, and went through 6 weeks of radiation.  In comparison to what you went through, not that bad at all.  I will say that from what I have read and heard from my Urologist, RPLND is a form of art.  If I had needed that she would have recommended I travel to Purdue University (for any Americans reading this) for the surgery.  This is in spite of me living in the same city as one of the best hospitals in the nation.  Apparently it is a very difficult surgery which requires surgeons to perform it consistently.   In the end I had my last day of radiation (in November,) got a ""diploma"" stating I had finished it successfully, went home, took a shower, and drove to the airport and flew down to Rio de Janeiro for 2 weeks.  I had planned the trip back June before all of this and it was one of the 1st things I discussed with my oncologist when we laid out my treatment plan.  Honestly some days it was the only thing that kept me going.  Anyways, the whole point of this was to say as time goes on, this will indeed just become a memory but also a part of who you are. For awhile I was getting CT scans every 3 months as I still had an enlarged lymph node, and of course blood tests, appointments with my urologist, appointments with my oncologist.  Funny how you only can worry about getting your testicle cut out when that is probably the quickest and smallest part of it all.  Now I am to the point of yearly checkups. I don't know why I got this disease but I do know it gave me a better perspective on life.  It made me realize little shit shouldn't bother me, and when I read about other people getting much worse cancers or ailments, I realize the shit I went through was almost insignificant;  I had to tell my best friend my diagnosis 2 months after his 30 year old sister died of brain cancer. That put it in perspective for me.  In closing, just remember what Lance Armstrong said: ""I take nothing for granted. I now only have good days and great days."""
cancer,38y4rs,rapmstrux,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:28:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your story with me. I'm glad that everything worked out for you!  Sorry, my story isn't that clear. I tried to shorten it and in doing so cut out some details. I was given the news about having the tumour in my testicle a few hours after my ultrasound. I had my CT scan the next morning and a few hours after that I was given the news that it had spread. Although I'd already suspected that because of the amount of pain I was in, but I hadn't suspected it to go as far as the lungs. The orchiectomy was a few days later because that was the first point they could fit me in, and I know they bumped my up the list as quick as they could. It's still a bit longer than you though! But after being ignored for 4 months, a few days didn't seem that long to wait in all honesty.  The RPLND isn't something that is done in the UK as much as in the US from what I've read, so I was a bit nervous about it. I'm very lucky that I live near a University Hospital and a leading Cancer Centre with some extremely talented doctors. It turns out my consultant has won quite a few awards and I absolutely cannot believe how incredible he is and the lengths he has gone to not just for me but my family too. Our NHS gets a hammering in the media all the time, but the quality of care I've had has been incredible. It makes a huge difference through the whole ordeal.  I love that Armstrong quote, I've never seen it before. I'm sure it will become a memory and I know it'll shape me for the better. At the moment some days I feel invincible and some days I feel very vulnerable. I'm sure it'll settle somewhere in between with time!"

After Radiation and chemo he had a PET scan this past March which showed it had metastasized to his liver. Then his tumor started bleeding and stopping the bleeding became a priority.  He was getting two blood transfusions per week while the doctors were were figuring out what to do next. It felt like so much time was wasted.... He was finally admitted to NY Presbyterian Hospital on May 22.  He passed on Monday and we had his funeral yesterday. I don't know if all the delays contributed to his decline or if the doctors didn't rush him into the hospital because they knew he'd never get out.  If that's what they were thinking they should have told us.  We would have spent the final month doing something else.  I can't shake the feeling that something was missed and at the very least he died sooner than he had to.  At least we that last beer together Dad. I miss you

For my (non-small cell) lung cancer, it took eight months to go from nothing-visible-on-the-X-ray to 8-cm-tumor-in-my-lung (plus more in my liver, spine, hip, and brain). By that point the spine & hip mets were so bad I couldn't walk without a cane...but fortunately radiation therapy worked great for those.   I really hope your sister gets the treatment she needs in a timely manner...cancer is already hard to deal with, but getting lung cancer as a nonsmoker just seems beyond unfair. Lots of people who find out I have lung cancer assume I was/am a smoker...and therefore ""deserve"" it."

For me to eat something in the days immediately following chemo, the food has to be just so - salty, fatty, and/or sweet, to be able to entice me. I haven't even tried to get Soylent down since beginning chemo - I'd probably yak it right back out. Note that Ensure is pumped full of corn syrup, so you might be able to get something like that down, or if you added a lot of peanut butter and chocolate to Soylent, that might work.  As an aside, nothing the doctors could ever prescribe stimulates the appetite like ganja. If you're into that."

When you can't eat getting calories can be the first step to stomaching more worthwhile foods. Not eating for long enough can make the nausea worse and in turn make it harder to eat.   They tend to taste terrible but the idea works well. If you can find something to either mix it with or some similar drink then go for it. I find that sticking to a meal schedule helps a lot. Also blending high calorie things into cold drinks. Like peanut butter  with light fruits.   In the last week I've thrown up everything I've touched including ensure so I can't say your mileage with it wont vary.

To me as a lay person it sounds like a sarcoma of sorts (usually in long bones in the leg, metastasizes to the lungs) in which case he absolutely needs to be at a tier 1 cancer center like MD Anderson, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Lurie/North Western Memorial or similar. It's where the best orthopedic surgeons are and where they have the best survival rates for these things. My husband just finished treatment for osteosarcoma last August.  To be honest, shit is going to be really ugly for a long time for him. Don't wait until he's half-way through chemo to encourage him to get the counseling he needs. Treat him like a person rather than a fragile object all the time. He'll be sick, tired and really angry a lot so I would offer to take him out for food when he's not horrifically neutropenic and tired, video games and movies and tv shows are also always appreciated in my experience.  Let him be angry! I think the worst thing my in-laws did was try to be too cheery all the time and they never let my husband be really, truly angry in a capacity that would let him process his 30 weeks of chemo and surgery. Recovery is a bitch afterwards too. Limb salvage surgery was over a year ago and due to some complications last fall, my husband is still on crutches and working his way off them.

The treatment plan for Ewing's generally spans a year or so - chemo, surgery, chemo and/or radiation.  There are lots of studies and technical information you can read on it - but take it with a grain of salt because there are so few cases out there (200-300 new cases a year) and each individual case is different.    It took me 3 - 4 weeks to begin to absorb my son's Ewing's diagnosis (January this year).  Now we focus on today, tomorrow, and maybe this week - what does he feel like eating (and what he is allowed to eat), what can he do in the hospital (he plays computer games on his laptop), how can we keep a connection with normalcy (friends visiting, keeping up school work).  There will be some up times when he isn't feeling the effects of chemo (there are some really good anti-nausea drugs out there), there will be some down times when he feels like crap, nothing sounds good to eat, or he's bored out of his skull.  As mentioned elsewhere, don't neglect the mental health resources available out there - not just for him and his parents, but for the whole family.  I was fortunate to run across some Ewing's patients who were a few months ahead of us so I could get a feel for what's in store.

Sucks it took so long to get him into remission, Does the Philadelphia chromosome come into play?"
cancer,38r6r1,tarlack,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:33:05 2015 UTC,"I came in February because he was placed in an induced coma. The steroids he was on sent his sugar up to almost 600 (normal is 120). He was diabetic for a few months, but the real problem was the neuropathy damage. He lost control of his left ankle, and for a little while, his left wrist also. So after he was released he was placed on 20mg of Oxy every 6 hours. At first he just passed out all day for a week or so. And when he was awake he would cry to me, or his parents, go back to sleep and then tell us he didn't remember anything the last 3 days. His short term memory was really bad tool. We didn't know it was the Oxy at all. It took some time for us to figure it out, then we slowly lowered his dose until he no longer needed it.    I tried telling him he should go see a counselor but he continuously refused. A lot of the time I would say ""We don't even have to go with your parents, it could just be me and you. Let's just sit in front of someone and just talk to me like no one is there, and let the access you."" But he's not a person who shares his emotions easily. He doesn't like going to support groups because he hates people feeling sorry for him. Which is why he just relies on me to be his shoulder.   The thoughts aren't as bad as they were when he was on Oxy, but they still concern me. Right now he's taking 5 mood suppressers daily, as well as two anti depressant pills in the morning. So honestly, I don't know what else is left, you know? Except for talking it out, which is really hard for him if it's not me or his family. If it's a stranger, even a childhood friend, he just shuts it all inside. I say even if it's a childhood friend because since his diagnosis he hasn't seen anyone, no one has been around through the majority of it all like I have, or his family."

It took me some time before I found a group that was helpful.  Look for a group that supports young adults,  we have a group called young adults cancer canada the have helped me in so many ways.  Look for a group in the U.S. Lots of groups now meet online so you don't have to pay or go away from home.  If you can not get him to do something, do it for yourself."

For him, all I can say is that talking to a counselor is very different from talking to a friend - at least for me. And maybe that with a counselor too you don't have to pour your heart out entirely if you don't want to. Trust needs time to be built."

IT's sent me down that road a few times like /u/tarlack said being high as a kite or just a zombie because of all the meds and facing your mortality is a mixture for the above thoughts. Even though I'm working on a high right now I know in a week or two or three so I'll hit that point again when it's going to seem like an option of killing myself is a better idea than waiting around to die.

It's a shitty situation, there is no getting around it; I.. go back and forth from weather I want to look at the positive, or the negatives in my own case, but... I find some comfort, in knowing that I've lived my life the best I can, and that unlike so many people, I have the power to choose when, how, and where I'm going to die.   I try to make sure I'm going to be remembered, and I have been making a point to try new things.

cancer,38nz07,damageddude,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:11:29 2015 UTC,"My uncle was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer with one year to live (which was quite accurate). Granted he was in his 50s and had the financial resources, but he basically got out his bucket list and lived life to the fullest. He and my aunt traveled like crazy. Though he didn't see his grandchildren, he got to meet all of his son-in-laws (only one was a son-in-law at the time), so he knew his daughters would be OK.  Last time I saw him healthy was at a cousin's bridal shower a few months before he passed (only the last 6 weeks of his life were really bad). I remarked how good he looked and he replied I feel good. Period. Even my 24 year old dumb-ass knew that was the end of discussion.  Now, keep in mind, he and my mother were from a generation where not only were there a lot of first cousins, but they were tight a tight family. If a cousin's child was getting married, everyone came to the party. Everyone knew it was probably the last time we'd see my uncle as a healthy individual. His health was ignored. My uncle was happy living life as normal, even for a few hours. It actually was the first event I went to where ""the cousins"" treated me like an adult and talked to me like one (man they were filthy). It is one of my better memories of my uncle. So full of life, so happy. Leaving memories for those of who survived him.   Sure, I remember the last day I saw him, a few days before he died, exhausted in his hospital bed while my mother gave him the latest family gossip (including her hopes I'd marry my newish girlfriend, which I did). I also have many childhood memories. But my favorite is the one from where he knew he was dying and just didn't give an F.  TL;TR - live life to the fullest, leave people with happy memories"

cancer,38piqb,philgmd,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:20:36 2015 UTC,"A question about your particular condition, because I am curious and confused.  I'm post thyroid cancer treatment as well. I've been on the other side of it and healthy a long time. But, I am and always will be clinically hyperthyroid, as a precaution against TSH stimulation causing a recurrence. Do you have an uptake issue that keeps you hypothyroid? As far as I knew, we're all supposed to be kept a little on the high side."
cancer,38piqb,131i,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:33:24 2015 UTC,"So, by my lab numbers I'm hyperthyroid, as my TSH is still suppressed. My doctor is concerned that with the extent of my disease, he'd like to keep it as low as he can.  My symptoms are all those of hypothyroidism. At this point nobody knows where the disconnect is between my lab values and my symptoms. I was started on T3 after I stopped working, which did help some.  This study mirrors my experience almost exactly. I've had most of those symptoms and problems."
cancer,38piqb,131i,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, once you've had thyroid cancer, TSH is the devil. I've been suppressed so long, I wonder if my pituitary would still be able to make any.   That's an interesting study. I've had some trouble over the years - insomnia and fatigue, digestive issues, palpitations. They all seem to occur when my T4 gets close to 30 - I'm fairly happy around 26, but if I get much higher, all hell breaks loose. It was always difficult to get doctors to understand that my blood could tell one story, while my body was telling another. I had a great endocrinologist in my twenties who worked with me to find the right balance and to make sure I understood what we were doing, so I could push future doctors to get it right (which has come in pretty handy since I left his care). I take good old-fashioned levothyroxine by itself - we've never supplemented it with anything else, just fiddled the doses until I got to the right numbers. Which has been a long, long process. The study seems to suggest that, statistically at least, some of the symptoms start to taper off over time. I hope you fall into that category."

Your fingers can't test for cancer - lots of guys have transient, slightly painful testicular lumps that are absolutely benign. Go to the GP - that should always be your starting place. Don't ask for testicular cancer screening - keep the explanation simple if you're worried about gossip. The nurse should be keeping her mouth shut; she's legally obligated to maintain your privacy. But if you think she's got a big mouth, tell her you have pain in your groin or lower abdomen (not really a lie, now is it?). You can clarify with the doctor when you get there. He can check it and see if more tests are merited - you may have something, you may have nothing. Like I say, lots of things cause what you're describing, so don't jump the gun."

It doesn't matter if its near it, but given that its on your jaw, the primary is likely above your shoulders.  Also, why the lymph node biopsy then? a hard node?  Ask your doctor if they think its a good idea to have the lymph node be sent out for second opinion.  There are also soft tissue melanomas (not on the skin) called clear-cell sarcoma.  Hopefully the PET scan gives you the answers you need.  If it is indeed melanoma in a lymph node, you are correct that it is at least stage 3."

Edit: nope you're right. It could be clear cell carcinoma. Has the same markers when biopsied. I really don't have anything that looks like a melanoma or skin tumor.

The bad part is the skin in the area is still very sensitive to the touch, and the muscles underneath often get stiff and sore. (There's also a big concave divot where lymph nodes and saliva glands used to be. It would be a pain in the neck to shave if the radiation therapy hadn't killed all the hair follicles.)  I didn't do hair-killing chemo, but the interferon I did take caused some hair to leave the party. My oncologist said it looked like stress-induced male pattern baldness, which freaked me out.

Your anger is justified...life has handed you a bummer storm, and the silver lining is not yet visible. If friends and family have offered help, let them. We sometimes are so ""strong"" and don't take advantage of assistance that is available. That was my biggest mistake. Accepting help is good for all parties involved. You only have 24 hours in your day and can only do so much.   As the struggle continues, remember this: Shared adversity is a bonding experience. And remember us here...vent early and often. We know your pain and the support here is amazing. My heart goes out to you all. Best wishes to your family."

It must be extremely hard for your wife not being able to be there and do a lot of the things as a mother she feels she should.   You're doing great, and things will improve as she comes to know what to expect with each treatment.

A very wise friend once told me that you BLESS people when you let them help you, they feel like they're part of the fight. Please call on family and friends to help with the baby or do the shopping, laundry, cleaning & meals. Maybe appoint a person close to you to schedule and manage those things for you.   I think I would be angry too in your situation, but unfortunately anger is an energy consuming, emotional choice that you just can't afford right now.  It fixes nothing, it's negative and not helpful. We seem to be under the impression that anger happens to us, in reality we have more control than we realize.   This is one of life's tests that reveals your inner strength. You have a chance to be the hero here, meditate, do whatever you need to stay focused on her healing and help keep her focus there too.  On my way to the hospital every day I prayed for the strength to be what my husband needed, to stand tall and be positive. Not for a lifetime, just that day.   One day at a time!  You have a tough situation no doubt, but just about the time you think it couldn't be any worse, a bald 5 year old gets on the elevator with his IV pole & his mommy with a tear swollen face. It sucks it's true but if you were in your wife's shoes, how would you want her to be around you?  Feeling angry and cheated or there on a mission to help you get healthy so you can go on with your lives?     It does get easier!  As treatment takes hold, she'll start feeling better, appointments become fewer and less dramatic. Right now shes in what I call the ""three step phase"". Where every piece of good news comes with 3 bad, one step forward, three steps back. ""This too shall pass"" became my favorite sentence.   I wish you the best of luck and I will say a prayer for you and your family, that your wife's health be restored and that you have all the strength and support you need to get to the healthy side of this chasm.

If you're angry, be angry. Just try to find a healthy outlet and don't take it out on your loved ones. Go lift weights or rock out on your guitar or kill bad guys in Halo... Whatever healthy way you can get out your aggressive feelings is good.    My mom was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer last April. She's in hospice now and the end is probably weeks away. I told myself in the beginning that there is no wrong way go feel, and I won't feel guilty for whatever emotions come over me. Giving myself that freedom has really helped me cope with the anger, sadness, and feeling of being overwhelmed.   I wish you and your wife a quick road to recovery.

cancer,38k6rn,rcowie,2,Thu Jun 4 20:05:04 2015 UTC,"I am not downvoting you, just wanted to pitch in here haha. I'm super not against it, however, I think its important to be careful when suggesting it to cancer patients because with some treatments it can adversely effect the patient. For example, testicular patients that receive bleomycin should NEVER smoke or even be around smoke again because your lungs are susceptible to serious injury. In addition, one of the tumor markers for testicular cancer is HCG, which can be effected by marijuana. Therefore, it is really important that cancer patients keep an open line of communication with their doctors so that things like marijuana don't mess with their treatment. It would seriously suck to use some marijuana and then have your tumor markers go up and make it seem like the cancer is back/worse.   Again, super supportive of medical marijuana, I just think it should be used under close supervision and you therefore have to be careful in making recommendations without fully understanding someones medical situation. Also, its not a cure. Please don't ever suggest it as a cure (I assume you aren't)."
cancer,38k6rn,DrXia,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"TC survivor here. The drugs were quite hard on the lungs, and smoking anything is almost certainly bad for the lungs. But having a little smoke greatly increased my overall quality of life. I lost like 100 lbs, and couldn't keep food down, and everything hurts. Knowing the next breath was gonna hurt just as much as the last. But just have a quick smoke and I could eat without vomiting shortly there after. And just for a while life didn't hurt so bad. Bad for the lungs sure, but so very worth it (for me anyways).  But by no means am I calling it a cure.  It was just a great mitigation to the side effects. I think I did the same course  of chemo as your SO, no fun at all, hope he is doing well."

Bleo does crazy, permanent, little understood things to your lungs, sometimes the effects of which can be seen decades later. Therefore, through published literature and doctors, we determined that it is best to protect your lungs as much as possible during and after bleo. I'm so glad though it really helped you, I'm only saying that there may be preferred ways of using marijuana that for some people may not result in serious damage. Very happy to hear though that you were able to use it and it helped you a lot, that is exactly why I'm a huge proponent of medical marijuana (even though I have never once smoked myself!). :-)  I hope you are doing so well now!"

When I was still on chemo at home I would just wash very slowly and carefully around my port area (when accessed) and try my very best not to get it wet.

Seriously, it was a HUGE help--let him get everything clean that he needed to and avoid getting the picc line (and saran wrap, to a degree) wet.  Anything he couldn't wash without getting the picc line wet, he kind of worked around with disposable wash cloths (i.e. armpit of the picc line arm), which you can find at Walgreens or wherever in the medical supplies section.

And by around the corner I'm saying a year if the tumor continues it's growth rate 2 years if we can get it to slow the fuck down or do a resection at the 6 month mark depending on my general health.  I used to go out all the time not with friends or anything but just outside whether it be a walk with my dog or to a movie or just to get out and walk around the city. Over the course of the last year I have become a shut in, a total hermit. My touch with the outside world involves the usage of most social media and things like reddit.   Recently and I have these small epiphanies throughout my treatment recently my wife and I came to the conclusion I and more indirectly her have been ""waiting"" for me to die. We stopped doing anything if it didn't involve us just being at home we didn't do it. I hadn't even taken a picture in at least 5 years of myself or with others, I always could see the tumor glaring right back at me in the mirror why would I want it in pictures. My outlook has changed in the last little bit although I still have my bad days where I'm like fuck it let's do this death thing and get it out of the way. But for the most part I'm trying to live to well live not live to die.   I have come out of seizures and not recognized my wife shoving her across the room because I don't understand why this strange woman is holding on to me. I've said some pretty mean and despicable shit because well I was having a bad day and misery fucking loves company.  She understands but it still hurts nonetheless I will add having a 20 second rule with us (Must wait 20 seconds for a repsonse to a question or statement) works great it gives you a chance to actually think before you respond.   I haven't eaten a solid food in almost 3 or 4 months I feel you it's actually one of the things I miss doing the most but I make the most out of it with shakes and smoothies, and I can send you a recipe book of some of the better ones I found. I try to keep them thick so it's sorta like eating but not.   Wipe being stoic for your family and your partner out of your mind. I think Stuart Scott said it best when he said there are times that you need to rest and that's when you let everyone carry on for you. It has nothing to do with being weak or the like but common sense because this disease and it's cure both like to ravage your body and mind. I'm not one of those positive thoughts positive outcome people I find it completely acceptable to flip a few tables during this time but since I'm weak I usually just settle for throwing an empty plastic bottle across the room and yelling. And if you're a religous person I always like to remind them that even per Jesus' example it's completely cool to flip a few tables and beat a few people with a whip, metaphorically of course would hate to see you on the 11o'clock news for whipping some people at a mall or something."

You should not have to carry the additional burden of being strong for others.  They are only shifting their grief onto you, that's not fair.  The only thing to do is to do what makes you happy. Spend good, loving time with those who you care about, don't dwell in future loss.  The only thing you can control is to be aware of the current moment.  So makes those moments mean something.

I don't know why either, I had just had stem cells collected, not another round of chemo or anything. I guess it was just being away from home, and having a strange line in my neck, and something about having all my blood filtering through a machine many times over which felt so unnatural. It took me a week but I bounced back from that funk..  Cancer is such a roller coaster, physically and mentally. Just when you start feeling good again, you get knocked back down. I'm sorry to hear what you're going through right now, but I hope it's only short term and you will be on the upswing again soon :)  You are not defective or broken.

It just isn't something you can conceptualize without going through something similar.   When we met, I had been in remission for about 2.5 years. I was still dealing with a lot of the emotional distress and readjusting, and I'm pretty sure I had PTSD of some form. Dating was hard, because if a first date went well, I dreaded having to tell them that I had cancer and it had some long term side effects. At the time, I wasn't far removed from it, so there was a lot I felt like I would need to say to a potential girlfriend.   I actually still remember the night I first told my girlfriend a lot of what I felt needed to be shared. I was scared she would get intimidated with my baggage and just dump me there. Instead, that was the first night she said she loved me. It was still terrifying - I was opening myself up to a girl I cared for very deeply with stuff that was very painful. I felt naked and vulnerable. It was a risk for me to share the pain I had been dealing with, but it paid off.   We are married now with a sweet little daughter. She still doesn't fully understand a lot of what cancer did or the memories I have to the side effects I still deal with, but it isn't my fight alone anymore. She loves and supports me, and in a lot of ways is why I'm even able to talk about cancer to other people. She helped me get over a lot of my PTSD symptoms.   So how does this apply for you? It sounds like you want to get into a romantic relationship, but feel like your Ptsd is getting in the way. It probably is. Unfortunately, there isn't a magic secret to having a relationship and dealing with that. At some point, I had to take a huge risk and open up and let myself be vulnerable to someone else. It isn't a pleasant thing to do, and it wasn't something I approached lightly. But it has paid off many times over.   If I were you, and getting into a relationship, I would be open about a little of what you went through. As much as you feel comfortable with. And say ""I don't want to talk about that"" if it gets too deep. Can't force yourself to be ready. But with baby steps in opening yourself up, flat out asking your partner ro be patient with you as you deal with it, I think you'll eventually get there. You may also be deeply hurt, but love has and always will have a very big risk of that.   Good luck. Ask questions if you've got them."

Be aware that micropapillary is different than papillary so don't get those confused if you read about the other one.  What is happening is that your mother has had a surgery to remove the breast cancer.  Some things are missing on this report which were probably included in an earlier one such as whether the margins are clear and what was done on the lymph nodes.  Regardless, extra treatments are generally offered to reduce the chance of the cancer coming back, including radiation and hormone therapy.

Postoperative radiosurgical treatment of the tumor bed should be able to get that number down to 10%. EDIT: Side effects of this type of treatment should be rather minimal.

cancer,389zru,Wyntersun,4,Tue Jun 2 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"Talk to the rad onc again about the benefits and side effects of whole brain. Motor issues and loss of independence are extremely unlikely with this treatment. Yes changes in neurocognitive function may occur down the line but this is generally small changes in short term memory and executive functioning (things like planning complex events without sticky notes) that we are still trying to nail down. I'm not trying to minimize a real radiation toxicity, but rather tell you honestly that in general, when whole brain radiotherapy is recommended, the toxicity from not having treatment is worse than the late toxicity of treatment. What I mean is, if these tumours continue to grow, it's possible your balance would get worse, and the new spots could cause very serious complications, and all of this can significantly impact quality of life. Are you on steroids? Do they have side effects? Is it possible radiation could get you off of them? Talk to the doc  Also,  you mentioned driving the car - given these new spots and the sometimes feeling like you had a couple of drinks, it might make sense to talk to the doc about whether that's the best idea right now, especially before treatment"

But I've been told he does very good work, so hopefully if I do decide to follow through with treatment this time I'll be in good hands. For me, the worst part of this whole cancer thing is the unknown...but your comment was reassuring, so thank you for that."
cancer,389zru,OTN,4,Wed Jun 3 05:52:54 2015 UTC,"Someone your age should be able to tolerate whole brain radiation very well. There can be some short-term memory issues, but recent research looking into both concurrent Namenda use and hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiation with IMRT (study was RTOG 0933 if you want to talk to your radiation oncologist about it) suggests a decrease in those issues with those techniques.   With the number of lesions you have growing, I'm afraid it sounds like whole brain radiation is the only option, and one I would push for very, very strongly."
cancer,389zru,OTN,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:28:09 2015 UTC,"I was just reading up about Namenda and shielding of the hippocampus as preventative measures...will definitely be talking to the radiation oncologist about this. Do you know of anything else one can do to minimize late-delayed radiation damage? (I read that's the kind that's irreversible and usually most devastating) Apparently antioxidant compounds and NSAIDs (certain types of painkillers?) can be helpful...so much to learn, and it's a nice distraction from stressing about these stupid mets :)"
cancer,389zru,r_slash,2,Wed Jun 3 17:33:48 2015 UTC,"Well, both the Namenda trial and RTOG 0933 demonstrated a decrease in short-term memory loss compared with historical controls, with both studies seeing a ~7% chance of memory issues, compared with 30% historically. I typically combine both the studies and use namenda along with hippocampal-sparing IMRT and counsel patients that the rate of memory issues is likely somewhere between 5-10% with those techniques. Some radiation oncologists are waiting for a randomized trial to start implementing hippocampal-sparing techniques, but I was very impressed with the data we have.   I'm not a believer at all in antioxidants, to be honest. While they sound good in theory, I always recommend avoiding them during radiation, as they could protect the cancer cells from XRT damage. Additionally, the best trial we have looking at antioxidant use actually suggested an increase in cancer development, so I tell people to avoid them. There's just something going on with that system we haven't yet figured out. The data on NSAIDs isn't great, either, but they certainly wouldn't hurt much."

cancer,389zru,billyvnilly,2,Wed Jun 3 17:51:17 2015 UTC,I would never avoid treating a lesion if it's adjacent to the hippocampus- you could instead avoid the contralateral hippocampus and try to get some of the benefit of sparing.

cancer,3899u2,fixitben,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:48:32 2015 UTC,I don't know how good the results are for other cancers but I have read some that it was showing good results for lymphoma and kidney and lung cancer. The side effects are much less than traditional chemo. When you are taking both drugs at the beginning it can be rough. Ipilimumab side effects are fatigue sore joints and rashes. Closer to 4th dose some people get a swollen pituitary gland which causes severe headaches. Steroids will shrink it back down. Once you get to the 5 dose it is only nivolumab by itself and after that it is much easier. I am on my 34 dose and have almost no side effects now. I have even played golf right after my infusion at the course across from the hospital. I wish you the best of luck and hope this works for you. It truly is the easiest treatment I have ever done.

The surgery wasn't too bad. And pain was minimal afterwords. But what will stick with me is this. When I went to my follow up appt with my surgeon, the first words out of her mouth were...Thank god you did the surgery. I had a pin sized spot of cancer that was in my left breast. It was in situ.

I don't have a prosthesis. But I love my life and I'm thankful for everyday. As for reconstruction, I am now on a 2 year waiting list for plastic surgery.

The reason is that the whole breast got removed, and that it had not spread to the lymphs.   Because I did not have radiation the reconstruction will be more easy for the surgeons. And they will end up with a nicer result. They said that DIEP-flap was mostly used for those who had radiation due to the damaged skin. Im getting expander in my right breast, then implants in both.

You being under 50 and having high grade are two strikes against you for having an increased chance of recurrence, the other being if the (possible) margins are positive in your (in the future/undecided) lumpectomy.  Radiation would decrease that risk of recurrence by 50% with the lumpectomy."

cancer,38429c,Wyntersun,5,Mon Jun 1 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"Hey congrats to you too! I am crossing my fingers that you will do well. I will never reach at state even remotely close to chill when it comes to scans. I was always chill about exams joking it wasn't a matter of life or death - but these scans are...  I forgot about my ""cancerversary"" and only realized recently that it has been a year and a month. I remember being diagnosed last year thinking it would be a huge milestone if I could get just another year, and then I simply forgot. But then again, noone showed up with confetti and balloons, so you can hardly blame me.  On the scans - I only have torso scans as I don't have brain mets, so they track my lung tumor to see if it moves (it's currently not measurable and the same with my mets).  I had a clear brain MRI around Christmas. Yeah, my wife teased me for a bit back then, saying it was hardly a surprise that a scan of my brain would be empty. On that note, I've found that having cancer means you develop a pretty sick humor... I joined an all-men cancer patient gym club about six months ago, and it has probably been better than any psych hours I could have paid for. People vent in different ways. It is amazing how competitive and brutally honest a bunch of has-beens can be, and I am always proud of any race I win, irrespective of the field of competition ;).  Again, crossing my fingers. Let me know how it goes."
cancer,38429c,Wyntersun,3,Mon Jun 1 21:16:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you're a ""Breaking Bad"" fan, but there's a scene where one of the main characters, Walt (he has lung cancer too), is sitting in a waiting room with a patient who's obviously really nervous about his scans. And what he said to him really stuck with me: ""I've been living with cancer for the better part of a year. Right from the start, it's a death sentence. That's what they keep telling me. Well, guess what? Every life comes with a death sentence. So every few months I come in for my regular scan, knowing full well that one of these times--hell, maybe even today--I'm gonna hear some bad news. But until then, who's in charge? Me.""  I try to tell myself that it doesn't do any good to stress about my scans, even if I'm pretty sure I'll be getting bad news, because stressing doesn't change anything about the results. If the results show progression, then the best thing is still to remain calm, and trust my doc to move me onto the next available treatment. Whatever happens happens, and we got way better things to occupy our minds and time with than this :)  Also, your wife sounds like a hoot. It really helps to have someone like that by your side, supportive but also with a good sense of humor.   The first and last cancer support group I attended was helpful, but it did irk me a little just how sensitive some of these people were. My sense of humor tends to be a little on the dark side too, so maybe I should try to join a mens' support group. Though it'd be easier if I wait til I have to get whole brain radiation so all my hair falls out, otherwise I'll have to cut/hide it :D"
cancer,38429c,Wyntersun,2,Tue Jun 2 00:11:45 2015 UTC,"I binged Breaking Bad when I was ill last summer, and I especially remember that scene (I also binged Fargo the series - I was in a morbid place?). You are absolutely right that we should not stress before we actually get bad results. I read somewhere that most terminal cancer patients have this as their biggest regret when they get to the end.... I buy into Walt's basic thought that you should not worry in-between scans, but it has significant implications for how I prioritize and spend my time. So it isn't black or white.  I used to have a hectic career, travelling a lot, spending time with a lot of different people etc. Now I live a much more quaint life. My job is something I do to keep some mental exercise and not least save money for my family. I am fortunate that way, that I can have an interesting ~70% desk job and still get paid the full amount and not least have that be fully accepted by my workplace. If I want to go mountain biking Thursday afternoon I just plan accordingly. But that is such a big mental leap for me and it has meant a big change in how I view myself. I feel like going from a big shot to a liability...   And when it comes to my friends, I have much fewer than a year ago. I basically have around five that I meet with regularly, and a lot that I just cannot relate to any longer (and they can't relate to me). I guess I had a lot of relatively shallow relationships and they just drowned. I had friends that couldn't understand my situation and where we had those weird calls after six months of silence, and I just stopped picking up the phone when they rang. Not sure that's a better practice, but I'm (slowly) dying, so what the hell...  On that note, my key priority is my family - they come first. It was really heartbreaking that my daughter was highly concerned because I had the cold this weekend (she still vividly remembers me being ill last summer). I get scared thinking about how she'll respond to what lies ahead... No child should go through that.  Men and women really deal very differently with cancer. It has been so evident to me since I fell ill. I prefer the male version - not that it's necessarily the right one for all or in all aspects... Maybe you can draw on a fake mustache rather than wait until radiation if you want to visit our world? We have cookies."
cancer,38429c,Realworld52,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:23:23 2015 UTC,"You know what, good for you for putting yourself before those people who aren't fully supportive and understanding of your situation, especially if it helps you feel better. It takes strength and cojones to make the decision to cut people like that out of your life. To most people, that would seem harsh...but as a cancer patient, I understand that some people want to stay in your life for the wrong reasons (using your cancer to get sympathy for themselves, trying to force their religion on you, because they don't want to look bad for ""leaving"" a cancer patient).   If your daughter's old enough to understand, maybe it would be good to discuss death with her and get it out of the way. Hopefully you won't die soon, but of course everyone's gotta go at some time or another, and (in my opinion) one of the few blessings of cancer is that it kinda forces you to consider and plan for death. I see my cancer as a reminder to spend as much of my remaining time with my loved ones, and show them how much they mean to me, before I go.  I will look into the fake mustache. My mom dragged me to a womens' cancer support group today...very nice ladies, and there were doughnuts, but they might still be a little too sensitive for me :)"
cancer,385aiy,riku65,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:23:28 2015 UTC,"My father has prostate cancer and was given between one to two years to live.  It had spread to his bones (matastisies) so they were going to try to slow it down with chemo.  I investigated CBDs and bought him a 3 month supply which was not cheap.  He used them through the first two rounds of chemo and never had a problem (three months had now passed).  In fact aside from food tasting funny, he did not understand why people said chemo was so bad.    He ran out of the CBD pills between round two and round three of chemo and didn't order any more because he was not convinced they helped.  Round three of chemo came and he was sick as a dog.  In bed for four days only getting up to go to the bathroom and drink as much liquids as he could keep down.  He got back on the CBD pills before the fourth round and again it was like the first two.  No problem and he felt fine.  It has now been more than a year and his PSA levels are still under 6.  He does not like to tell people he takes CBDs because of the stigma associated with marijuana.  But I can tell you he will take them for the rest of his life.  The good news is, CBDs are now legal in all 50 states so the price has come down significantly.   I know all people react differently, but the literature on CBDs is quite moving.  I wish you and your father the best.  Spend as much time as you can with him!"
cancer,385aiy,spockoli,2,Tue Jun 2 00:47:55 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. A year ago his psa went up to 25 then recently to 69. His most recent hormone treatment only brought it down to 58 which is why the doctor recommended Chemo to him. I'm studying in the health science field but im only half a year in so I don't know much yet. But I could see him and my mom worry so much. Personally the mild dose was relieving to me the first time I heard but days before his procedure we got a call that his psa rose up to 98 but his doctor called that he expected that and that was the reason he suggested chemo. I'm just concerned if his cancer's aggressiveness this time around but I really appreciate your comment.
cancer,385aiy,spockoli,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:36:16 2015 UTC,My dad's PSA was 124 before they could do anything.  He had a stint in his heart and had to be on blood thinners for a year.  They knew his PSA was high and it was likely cancer but they could not do anything until he could stop the blood thinners.  The chemo can really help... oh yeah he is also on estrogen therapy... testosterone makes the cancer grow so they put him on estrogen as well.  Please do research on CBDs also.  A lot of people say it is bro-science but it has changed my father's life.
cancer,38553l,ilurb,4,Mon Jun 1 22:45:27 2015 UTC,"it is almost 95% certainty that it will lead to her death, eventually. Stage 4 refers to the progression of the tumor spread.  the likelihood that you can totally eradicate all the tumor is decreased when it has spread so much (which is why newer system-wide chemotherapy drugs are so important...trials of ipilimumab and nivolumab have been very promising). Yes/no.  If a chemo line fails, they may switch to a different one, but they wont keep giving her a chemo agent that fails to shrink the tumor. Age can have a little to do with survival, but not significant after 5yrs in my opinion... so survival of stage IV at 5yrs is like 1%.  10yr survival would therefore be less than 1%  Hopefully in 10yrs, we can look at newer chemo drugs and say that they have made a significant difference."
cancer,38553l,billyvnilly,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:04:48 2015 UTC,"The ACS has a page that answers most of your questions about survival here. I would especially like you to note this disclaimer at the bottom of the page:     But many other factors can also affect outlook, such as the genetic changes in the cancer cells, the treatment received, how well the cancer responds to treatment, and a person’s overall health. Even when taking these other factors into account, survival rates are at best rough estimates. Your doctor can tell you how the numbers above may apply to you.     Her oncologist would be the best equipped person to answer treatment/prognosis/overall survival questions, especially knowing her history. But beyond that, remember that survival rates are ""at best rough estimates"". Your mother is a statistic of one. I wish her all the best."

""Remission"" refers to the point in a cancer treatment where the cancer is no longer detectable in the body (although not necessarily cured). The word you are looking for in your second question is ""relapse"", where a cancer re-occurs in an individual that has previously been ""cured""."

cancer,38553l,Aalynia,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:16:39 2015 UTC,"My wife has stage 4 nsclc, that spread to the liver.   If the lung cancer is in a non-smoker, there is a high probability that it's caused by a genetic driven mutation. Based on some discoveries made 8-10 years ago, there are now drugs on the market that inhibit the mutation from creating new cancer cells.  So there is hope. The less underlying health issues such as heart problems, liver problems, etc, the better the odds. If the cancer has spread to the brain or bones, it makes treatment very difficult.  The lung cancer survival rates you see are based  on the 5 year prognosis for the total population of lung cancers, including patients who smoked and patients  who did not have access to these very recently developed drugs. My wife is on a drug, gilotrif, that was just FDA approved in July 2013.  TLDR: The 5 year numbers are bad, but there is hope. Stage 4 lung cancer is awful, and very aggressive, but if there are no other serious health issues  modern medicine may be able to get a handle on it in as little as  6 really long and terrible months.   She won't be cancer free in 6 months, but it may be under control."
cancer,38553l,belhanj,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:03:02 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I can't say I'm a doctor or have knowledge specifically of lung cancer, but I spent a great of time dealing with the subject when my SO had stage 3 (and eventually stage 4) ovarian cancer. To get the best answers to these questions you're going to need to speak with your mother's doctor, which is probably quite possible for you to do.  I'll answer these questions based on extensive research and what I feel are generally accepted thoughts on the subject.  1) Anything is possible. Nothing is guaranteed. Although your first reaction (along with pretty much everyone) is to look at statistics you should remember that none of those people are you mom and that means you'll never know for sure what's going to happen.  2) In most cases it is - that's why it's stage 4. I'm not specifically sure what you mean in the second part of this question.   3) You shouldn't think about this question in this way since it's all based on circumstances. If you mom were to choose treatment and and were able to survive until remission, then technically your answer is no. However, at stage 4 it is also an option to avoid treatment altogether if the risks and burdens outweigh the potential gains. In that case, the circumstances are fundamentally different.  4) This question may be impossible to answer, and even if there were an answer it likely doesn't matter. Do yourself a favor and don't focus on those numbers. These statistics become even less reliable AFTER that 5 year window, so any data would likely be nothing more than a guess.  I truly realize how hard and confusing these things can be. Be with your mom and realize that life is precious no matter what the outcome. I wish you all the best."

My doctor did say eat healthy and exercise because that helps keep your immune system at peak performance.  Just do what you can.  Take a multivitamin, drink a glass of V-8 a day, take a walk with the kids and go with it.  The positive thinking stuff comes from Bernie Siegal.  I read some of his stuff and he basically says if you don't think positive your cancer will come back, which is baloney  -his books just made me feel guilty.  I read another book that says positive thinking doesn't cure cancer - as many grumpy people get better as happy people.    I think your mom is coping by trying to control what she thinks can be controlled.  She loves you.  Just nod your head and agree with everything she says and lie if you have to - thats what I do - and do what you need to do to cope."

Yes she needs to stay as positive as possible, but it isnt a magic incantation. When she needs to cry, she needs to cry. And thinking about all the possible outcomes is normal. Sometimes I just want to choke my mom, but I settle for politely telling her to close her mouth. ""I love you mom, but you are not helping. Stop talking please.""

It is very hard for me to admit that maybe my wife wont be ok, I cant imagine how it would be if it were my daughter. She needs to learn to be helpful, but try to give her a chance. But seriously tell her to shut up for 10 minutes and just let you talk, then explain it to her. Dont let her interrupt or leave the room. She needs to hear it as much as you need to say it."

I felt like such a failure to have not been able to keep him hydrated, but he just simply would not drink anything. His substitution when he could eat/drink was carnation instant breakfast.

As far as tests and scans go, it really depends on what type of cancer you had and what stage it was when diagnosed.

cancer,382sao,Sydquan,2,Mon Jun 1 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"First off, for testicular cancer treatment with BEP or EP, chemo should NEVER be delayed because of low counts. You should strongly consider talking you your doctor immediately and putting it back on schedule, or starting tomorrow instead of waiting a week. (Or contact Dr. Einhorn [the TC expert] right away if you need more proof of my statement).   Your surveillance regimen largely depends on the stage you were at when diagnosed and what treatment you have or haven't received (i.e., RPLND) outside of chemo. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides guidelines that should be followed perfectly for the care of TC patients. It can be found here:  http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#testicular  You have to create a login, but it is free and the guidelines are super easy to follow because they are in flow chart form with links you can click on. Also, as soon as your post-chemo scans and your tumor markers are normal you will be declared in remission. :-)  My husband, who had stage 1s nonseminoma at diagnosis, did 3xBEP and an RPLND has his tumor markers checked every 2 months and CT and chest xray every 6 months.   Best of luck to you! So happy you are on the home stretch!!! :-)"
cancer,382sao,DrXia,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:06:12 2015 UTC,"Congrats on getting through chemo! Ask about the monitoring from your doctor and they should give you a pretty good outline. Could be blood tests every two weeks or so until you get a few months out, then monthly, then every 3 months kind of thing.  With TC, if a relapse occurs, it's usually within the first year or two. After that, odds of that happening continue to go down until around the 5 year mark where you are pretty much considered cured.  Good luck, and all the best! I haven't got to the remission stage yet, but I know the next few years are not easy either because of anxiety around every monitoring test."

High: Starting to get in a rhythm for studying for the bar. Some days are good some are bad but at least I'm trying my hardest!  Low: I went in and got the lump in my neck checked out. Onc sent me to an ENT who had a ultrasound... weird lymph node. ENT says its probably bengin but Onc put in a referral to Interventional Radiology to have a biopsy just to be safe. I'm sure it is bengin too, but at the same time I can't shake the worry and am having a hard time focusing on studying, plus I'm a little worried about having to take a few hours out of my day for the biopsy.

High: I've had a relatively easy process so far. My PCP was amazing listening to my symptoms and walking through hematologists/oncologists with me. I met with the specialist who seems very attentive and scheduled a lymph node and bone marrow biopsy for Thursday!  Low: The wait. I'm in a weird stage where I want to be private about everything but at the same time, wanting to break down everything to the first person I see.  I'm at a point where I am still hopeful the tests will come back negative for anything malignant but I'm steeled for bad news if it comes to it."

Taking sick days as it sucks that bad."
cancer,380lo9,lashyy,3,Sun May 31 23:41:03 2015 UTC,I personally don't think it doesn't have to be almost taboo. I have no anger towards the disease itself and am happy to discuss every aspect including death as a result. I think fear drives a lot of people's response as it brings up the pain and misery that can be a big part of their experience. Once you accept that cancer is a part of your life and your goal to be free of it and at the same time get the best from every moment then you can live and move on a lot more easily than if your in fear of what might happen. Talking and communication is crucial in dealing with part of the experience.
cancer,380lo9,MrsClaypool,2,Mon Jun 1 10:33:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's about fear too. Fear in those with it, those supporting them, and those who just hear about it. When most people hear ""the C word"", they hear death sentence instead, which is of course not true in a lot of cases anymore.   I studied biology and used to be very interested in cancer. That is, until I was diagnosed with it. Now it's a bit of a curse since I know a lot of what the doctors are talking about or what they are going to say and have to explain it to friends and family. Most of the time I wish I was blissfully ignorant of all that stuff and could just let the doctors do what they need to do without me analyzing and overthinking things. Is it out of fear? Yes, I'm terrified. I'll admit it.   I wouldn't like people asking ""So... How is the... You know.... Thing.. You're dealing with..?"" People can be direct, but have some tact as well. Don't ask me where my mutated, renegade cells have recently metastasized to.   It shouldn't be as taboo as some people have made it, but it should be treated respectfully as well. At least that's how I feel about it."
cancer,380yuz,Phemtos,5,Mon Jun 1 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"Stem cell transplants are incredibly difficult to recover from. It took me a few months before I could even walk several miles at a time, and about seven months before I actually started exercising in earnest again.    It takes a  long time to rebuild strength, especially with everything that's happened to our bodies, and all the muscle loss. I think giving him a goal to accomplish every day is good, but I think you should be careful not to push him. Stay well below his limits or you may push him into needing several days to recover from overdoing it. I would go by time rather than distance - let his effort stay constant each walk. Gradually increase the time as he recovers - it may take a couple weeks before you can increase the time. Start with five to ten minutes a day (it really depends on his limits - ten minutes might be too much right now), and see how that works out.    Best of luck to him."

Cancer is cruel because it can seem like it changes the personality of the person we love. In my experience, those changes we see are fleeting and the person we knew is still very much there. They're just in the fight.  He'll have a lot of downtime, so you could come up with books, movies, video games, new hobbies even.

The relationship is new enough where I've only known him during his fight with cancer, I know he dealt with a lot of depression prior and a lot of his friends have told me meeting me has greatly changed his demeanor. But  I am stressed about the strain it will put on our relationship. I'm afraid he'll resent me for babying him."

Yes, it could very well put a strain on your relationship. It was sometimes tense for my brother and his GF. That strain gradually brought them closer together. It was intensely difficult at times, but their love kept him strong.   I don't know the side effects of a stem cell transplant but if they're severe, he may realize he needs you to keep fighting.

With allo SCTs you have to worry about GVHD and complications from that, which is not a worry with auto SCTs. Recommendations somewhat depend on whether he's getting an allo or auto SCT. For example, auto patients tend to recover faster and spend less time in the hospital than allo patients, since the SCT is re-infusing their own previously harvested stem cells.     The transplant center should have given him a binder with specific instructions for his transplant. If they haven't you can find the transplant binder put out by the Cleveland Clinic for allogeneic patients here. The auto transplant binder is here. It will give you a great run-down of what to expect.     Secondly, being a carer in this way will put a strain on your relationship, especially as you're giving up your old life to move to him. I'm not sure how you plan on dealing with that, but I hope you have someone you can talk to, and preferably someone to help share the load.    Feel free to PM with specific questions.

Get a lot of boneless skinless chicken breasts, chicken broth and plain rice.  All I wanted to eat for a couple weeks when I got home was bland food.  He will be tired.  Walking to the bathroom will be exhausting.  Try to make sure he has water and all the things he needs on a day to day basis near him.  Get a chair for in the shower.  Its hard to stand that long.  In the first weeks, I spent a lot of time napping.  Even though he will be tired, encourage him to take short walks.  I had a pedometer and at the beginning I probably wouldn't break 400 steps a day.  Don't let him over do it though.  Its easy to over do it because you feel great and do a whole bunch of things!  But the next day you feel like absolute shit because you did too much.  Netflix was helpful and I wish I had a tablet to make surfing the internet from bed or the couch easier.  He will need to see his oncologist very frequently after release from the hospital.  From every couple days, to every week, to every two weeks, to every month etc.  Going to the doctor is kind of a big exhausting deal, so don't really plan on doing much else those days.

Be sure you're doing stuff for yourself too.  Go to the gym, take a yoga class, get your nails done whatever makes you feel good.  Will he still be in the hospital when you come out?  I think it would be a good idea to talk to the nurses.  They have lots of good info.  Whatever paperwork he gets when he leaves the hospital will also be helpful.  Check and see if the hospital has a BMT caregiver class.  A lot of them do, and that might be helpful to you also."

Getting information really really helps. It helps takes you- at least a little bit- out of the realm of feelings and strong emotions and helps you grasp a thread of logical reality- grounds you when you feel like you're a kite in the wind.

With my lymphoblastic leukemia, I had one enlarged lymph node for several months before having a second one pop up about a month before diagnosis, and then several in different places a week or two before diagnosis. I know you really want to have a good idea of what you're looking at, but I don't think you can prognosticate very accurately based on how the lymph nodes are looking. The B symptoms you're describing are much more related to cancer. There are just so many different causes for lymph node swelling, but combining that with the B symptoms narrows it down a bit. I'm really hoping it turns out to be something other than cancer. Best of luck to you."

cancer,37t3s7,Lostinparadise2,1 point,Sat May 30 09:42:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm in the public system which means the same course of treatment but sometimes longer wait times (mostly for optional procedures), shared wards (you never know who your neighbors will be), and other slight discomforts (the food's not great but that's not really the point of a hospital stay), but I'm more than happy to foot the tax bill to avoid the unpredictable pitfalls of private insurance (I'm originally from the US and have accumulated a number of horror stories from friends and family there which range from bankruptcy to refused procedures). The care is professional and based on best practices - it's just not very flashy.  Right now it's just a waiting game now to see if the lymphoma responds as expected to the front line treatment (since it's been over six years since my previous treatment they're treating it as a new occurrence of disease, not a relapse) or if other options need to be considered.   Last time around I had no real symptoms other than localized pain from the tumor (which was removed in the initial surgery). Due to location (center of the brain) it's a different story now - the double-vision and dizziness are a constant reminder that something is amiss. Definitely a harder slog but so far the support has kept me going. One day at a time."

I know with melanoma, for example, if it metastasises to the lung or whatever it's still melanoma. But because you were out of the woods, are you now in fact a ""new"" cancer pt with a different type of cancer? Ah, it's just semantics, it still sucks and I feel for you. Best of luck with the chemo, hope you get a good response. I've got a good friend about to start chemo, any suggestions for a care pack (she's a middle aged woman, stage 4 bowel metastasised to liver)."

Ninja edit: worst thing happened a few days after the first infusion. I was sitting on my couch and put too much trust in to a fart if you know what I mean. Luckily I was alone and wearing pants!!!

cancer,37rqe5,blameitonthewookie,2,Tue Jun 9 21:55:06 2015 UTC,"I just finished my 4th cycle of ABVD for stage III Hodgkins. The weeks around my diagnosis and start of chemo were a whirlwind for me. I saw several doctors in the first 2 days after diagnosis - oncologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, cardiologist, pulmonary specialist, and fertility specialist. I carried around a small notebook to write down notes during appointments and questions that popped up afterward. There will be so many recurring appointments! I keep them all in my phone's calendar.   After the first month, I got into a routine. As for treatment, I go in every 2 weeks for infusions. On the ""off"" week, I go in to get a CBC. I get nausea, (haven't vomited though) tons of hot flashes, fatigue for days, indigestion, heartburn and constipation. Don't try to tough out your side effects (or do, it's up to you). Each time I mentioned a side effect, my oncologist had a remedy  (basically more meds to deal with it) and it has helped me feel better tremendously. My hair hasn't completely fallen out but it's thinning a lot. I shaved it a week after that started because my scalp would physically hurt after treatment when I had hair. It feels so much better without hair.   After writing all that, I realize YMMV.  Let me know if you have questions!"
cancer,37rqe5,karebearx,2,Fri May 29 23:14:55 2015 UTC,"I ain't gonna sugar coat it, bud, cause you need to hear how bad it can be. And even then I still consider myself very lucky that my side effects weren't worse, because they certainly could've been. But there's a happy ending (for now) so have a listen.   For me the chemo (ABVD) fucking sucked. A few hours after the first round I started vomiting for hours. I almost had to go to the hospital because I was getting dehydrated. Eventually it stopped.  Every session after that I didn't vomit because they put me on stronger medicines but those had other side effects that still sucked. For 3 days after my chemo I would just sit/lie on a couch at my parent's house because I felt so nauseous/drained/shitty. I think maybe I did vomit a little bit a few times after that but nothing like the first time.  By the 5th day after each session I was back at work, full of energy and kicking ass, so that was fun.  The happy part is that a year later I'm pretty much back to normal. My immune system ain't what it used to be and never will so sometimes a cold turns into pneumonia but it's only happened once so far so I ain't too worried.  Since then, I've hiked the Inca Trail, scuba dived in Thailand and almost got attacked by a pack of wild dogs in Hong Kong. So life can be quite good after cancer. Especially the whole being alive part. It sounds weird to say, but we're lucky we have Hodgkin's... it could be much, much worse.  Let me know if you have any specific questions. I'm happy to answer them."

One advice I want to tell you is don't tell everyone what's going on. Some people don't know how to act when they know your sick, especially some friends. You're going to realize that some friends are phony, but in the end the true ones will be there. Also don't get caught in statistics. This is your battle and positive thinking helps. Also read the Bible, it's a good comforter.   Also one thing you want to do before hand is to get a fertility doctor to help your preserve eggs or sperm because the chemotherapy drugs can cause you to not have kids."

cancer,37p6sa,code_wise,3,Fri May 29 08:40:18 2015 UTC,"Only thing I can offer is just because a testicle is firmer doesn't mean it's cancer.  I have had a cyst on my healthy, remaining ball since I was like 9 years old, and the epididymis on top and bottom is all jacked up, and because of the cyst it's generally sore (not painful, just sensitive).  But I've had like 6 ultrasounds in my life prior to my TC diagnosis and there were and are no issues.    THIS DOESN'T MEAN THIS IS THE SAME FOR YOU and you shouldn't still explore it and look into things but don't be doom and gloom.  TC cure rate is generally very high.  Life insurance is only useful in one facet and the object is to make sure you don't need it.  If you have health insurance, go to the doctor.  If you needed to have it removed the surgery really isn't that bad in terms of needing disability or paid time off."

Only 1 in 10,000 testicular tumors are NOT cancerous, so he should take this super, super seriously. It is literally life or death (or an easy-ish surgery versus chemo+rplnd+etc)..."
cancer,37p6sa,DrXia,2,Fri May 29 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"It's more than a little irresponsible to say what he is describing is bad news based on four lines of text, whether or not it turns out to be true.

cancer,37p6sa,eatingcarbs,1 point,Fri May 29 14:59:08 2015 UTC,"I apologize- totally not trying to come off as irresponsible at all, the opposite actually. The whole reason I am even on reddit is to try and help out because I have spent a lot of time and effort ensuring that I am properly informed. I'm really trying to emphasize that this should be taken extremely seriously. A lot of men aren't well versed in anatomy and consider any differences in their scrotum to be testicle related... There are many benign things that occur outside the testicle (the cyst you mentioned before, hydroceles, vericoceles, etc) that can be misjudged as something more seriously. Unfortunately, when it is actually in the testicle, the chances of it being cancer are much, much higher. The prevalence of benign tumors in the testicle is very low and is more common in very young (children) populations.   ANY time something is off with the testicles it should be approached with a doctor immediately because the risk of it being something quite serious (not just cancer, but torsion, which is associated with a lot of pain and can result in loss of a testicle). It is often a little more obvious when the problem is varicoceles (presents as a wormy or bag of worm feeling) or other common testicular issues... but obviously that isn't always the case. Fingers crossed it is nothing, but downplaying it could cause him to delay going to the doctor more. It's hard to know the right approach but I often see people on here responding to guys saying ""its probably nothing"" when that isn't necessarily true (if we were talking swollen lymph nodes or something, then yes, this is often true... testicles, not so much).   It's also important to remember that testicular cancer is misdiagnosed the first time around about 30% of the time, which is why I said don't leave without an order for an ultrasound. I sincerely am not trying to seem irresponsible but I have been learning about this for a year and half now and really know red flags when I see them. Just trying to be helpful!"
cancer,37p6sa,DrXia,2,Fri May 29 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"Don't apologize, I just think that our culture is so ""run to Mayo Clinic website find out what's wrong with me.""  I have had what was deemed epididymitis half a dozen times where I'd get swelling, firmness and soreness and random other shit.  Stuff like TC crosses your mind but it wasn't until I found an actual lump in Feb that I realized this was diff, and even still until they told me I didn't connect the dots as dumb as that sounds in hindsight.    If he has a legit lump yes it's way different, I only said what I said because people are pretty largely wrong when it comes to judging their own bodies and health issues.  From scanning this sub and your posts, you've really been through it with your husband and I didn't mean to come off wrong.  But for lots of people, IN THEIR MIND, constant headaches is always a brain tumor and never just migraines, and blood in the stool is always colon cancer and not hemmorrhoids. People are nuts."
cancer,37p6sa,eatingcarbs,1 point,Fri May 29 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you! It's usually either avoid an issue and pretend it isn't happening or panic and assume the worst! It's hard to figure out the line of freaking someone out versus downplaying it too much... I think I tend to lean towards the former because even though my husband was at the urologist and diagnosed within a week of some minor firmness and pain, he didn't have his orchiectomy for a couple more weeks. I often wonder if those couple of weeks moved him from stage 1B to 1S, which ultimately resulted in chemo and then the RPLND for a teratoma about 8 months after chemo ended... He is doing really well (except for 1 stupid lymph node we are keeping an eye on...) but I would have given anything to have the last year and a half be a little easier.   Best wishes to you! Hope you are doing really well and that this is behind you (as much as it ever can be)."
cancer,37p6sa,DrXia,2,Fri May 29 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"Can't really worry about insurance if you're dead, can you?  Hiding medical concerns from insurance companies if it is a legal part of their evaluation can serve to disqualify you from coverage, too, even if you take out a policy, so even if there's some part of you thinking that keeping this to yourself for the sake of fucking insurance is a good idea, it straight up is not.  Go to the doctor.  THEN, AFTER you've taken care of that vastly more important concern, call up your insurance company, ask to speak to a policy specialist, and explain your situation.  If you want, call from a different number and give them a fake name if you're that concerned (but in the end it won't matter).  They will answer all of your questions or escalate the call to someone who can.  I did some quick Googling and found that each case is individual and needs to be evaluated as such.  I don't know particularly what that involves (probably medical records, etc.), but again, let me reiterate that doing nothing and allowing your condition to worsen without diagnosis and treatment (if needed) will do nothing for you, your marriage, or your insurance situation.  It will worsen each of them.  Go to the doctor.  Go to the doctor.  GO TO THE DOCTOR."

Seriously, call today and don't leave without an order for an ultrasound. If it is testicular cancer, catching it early could save you from a LOT of uncomfortable treatments and it could just be behind you very quickly. The more you put it off the higher the chance is that it could be something more serious, especially because testicular cancer grows very rapidly. I hate to say it, but what you describing should be taken very seriously.   TC is one of the most treatable cancers with a cure rate well in the 95% range. However, it also spreads quickly and those that fall in the stats you don't want to be in are often people that put off a ""weird feeling"" for a while.   You didn't say anything about health insurance? If I were you I would buy insurance today, after you call and make your appointment to see a doctor! Seriously, the money it costs is so worth it.

cancer,37ol7d,KingOvHell666,1 point,Fri May 29 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"The skin lesion was 3 cm? and it was cut out?  If it is skin metastasis, it is a bad sign.  But as you say all her other scans are negative?  I am confused why you say she is in remission 5 years ago, but is on chemo the past 4 months.  Is she on chemo for the skin lesion, or is the skin lesion new?"
cancer,37ol7d,billyvnilly,1 point,Sat May 30 17:54:16 2015 UTC,"I might have not been clear. Sorry. So: she had cancer 5 years ago. Got surgery, utherus removed and did chemo. Declared in remission. All the scheduled tests came clear and was no sign to worry. This was last year in june. This year in january, she felt a pain around her belly button that turned out to be a tumor. Got surgery, was removed and then declared as a skin metastasis of the old cancer, located on the abdominal wall. During the surgery, the surgeon(who also did the surgery 6 yrs ago) looked at all the organs he could examine and said they are clean. The CT revealed the same thing, no detectable signs were present. Lung X-ray also didn't show any signs of tumor. The doctor said everything looks very normal, and she was lucky it localised on the abdominal wall. Now, she's in chemo for 4 months and got another 2. If it's important, the tumor was id'ed as a necrotic adenocarcinoma. After the chemo is over, she's scheduled for markers, CT and MRI. If there are signs of suspicion, a PETCT will be done.  As far i could find on the internet, skin metastasis is usually a bad sign. At best, i could hope that it's not a skin metastasis and i might have mixed terms and got all too worried about. I'm quite desperate, actually."
cancer,37mizs,Ignitius,2,Thu May 28 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"I got an RPLND done, but it was a surgeon that cut me open. I had TC Stage 2A which means it had spread to my lymph nodes. I had it done after the chemo.    You'll spend about a week in the hospital to recover. During this time, you won't really be allowed to eat anything, mainly clear liquids like broth. Expect a lot of pain meds. After you get discharged, you'll have to follow a special diet where at most you're allowed 5 gms of fat a day. It can be hard but manageable and it's only for 2-3 weeks. You get a pamphlet explaining this. No peanuts for a year etc. As for ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation might be a side effect. Basically when you orgasm you'll feel like you're ejaculating but nothings really coming out.    Other than that, just little things, like when you cough or sneeze, try to hold a pillow on your stomache so you don't rip out the staples. They'll usually remove them before you get sent home. I don't remember much regarding how painful it was, but I wasn't able to sleep on my stomach for the longest time, even after it healed, and I haven't worn a belt since either.     Edit* I just remembered, you also get a girdle thingy to wear at home for those first few weeks."
cancer,37mizs,Acidsparx,1 point,Thu May 28 20:17:37 2015 UTC,I assume it was open then? How was the scar/insides afterwards? My surgeon wants robotic/laproscopically (no idea how to spell that) but I heard conflicting ideals about its effectiveness. Thank you for sharing that with me.
cancer,37mizs,Acidsparx,2,Thu May 28 20:29:53 2015 UTC,"Yea, they pretty much cut me open. I have a scar that runs down from my sternum, around the belly button, to the top of my groin. I've read about it being done laproscopically which saves the nerves so you most likely won't have retrograde ejaculation as a side effect and the recoverys better but I'm not entirely sure and it wasn't an option for me."
cancer,37mizs,DrXia,2,Thu May 28 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"Are you stage 1A or 1B? Nonseminoma? Tumor markers normal I assume? Keep in mind that your treatment at stage 1 is also up to you, especially depending on whether you are A or B... You should understand the costs and benefits very clearly when moving forward to make sure your doctors are acting in your best interest.   The robotic (or do you mean laproscopic?) RPLND is not super recommended in the field because a lot of specialist don't think it is very effective. An RPLND should only be performed by an expert that has extensive expertise in this kind of surgery. Most urologists rarely perform it and because it is an operation that can cause significant effects (e.g., retrograde ejaculation, bowel obstruction, lymphocele, etc) and is technically challenging. You really have to know what you are doing and I would only trust my body (although, im a girl...) to Dr. Sheinfeld at MSKCC (my husband's doc) or Dr. Foster at IU, who is part of Einhorn's team. They are excellent and would offer you the best chance at having the best outcomes in terms of both side effects of surgery and chance of recurrence.   I can't speak for the laproscopic procedure, but my husband had an open RPLND at MSKCC. The surgery is not super easy, but it isn't impossible either. He had surgery in December and was in the hospital for a week. The biggest thing that will help your recovery will be walking. My husband really pushed himself every day to get up and walk and we really think that was HUGE for his recovery. You are on a very high fat diet for a day or two before (turns the lymph nodes white and makes them easier to identify) and a VERY low fat diet for quite a while afterwards (I think it was like 6 weeks). My husband has done really well, although it did take a couple months for him to regain his energy levels and be pretty much back to normal. He also has retrograde ejaculation but we aren't sure if it is permanent. Dr. Sheinfeld seems to think it will come back but it could take years. /u/acidsparx hit the nail on the head with all of his advice :-) The girdle thing help my husband a lot too, especially while he was in the hospital. Oh, and they now say no popcorn or corn or large amounts of seeds (like those in fruit) in addition to the no nuts rule.   Husband has a huge scar running all the way down his belly. It is still pink now, about 5 months later, but I'm sure over time it will be less and less visible. Plus, scars are sexy ;-)  Sorry to ramble! If you have any questions feel free to let me know! Best wishes!"

cancer,37min3,adenocarcinoma,6,Thu May 28 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"At last check, mine was 9264.8. It was 14,203.7 (a personal record) back in January. 11.5 is bupkis.  Go upstairs and play with your kids.    On a more serious note, I hope it's just a blip. My doc tells me that a lot of things can make it move around randomly. For example, if you're a smoker, the ""standard"" range doubles. CEA isn't a direct tumor marker, it's just something that if it gets really high, it's a pretty good indicator. This could totally be nothing, but it's great that you're on top of it and will be able to manage whatever it is as soon as possible. That's infinitely better than ignoring it and letting it kill you.  Scans are fun anyway...more neat pictures to look at and speculate wildly since you have no clue what you're looking at :)"
cancer,37min3,adenocarcinoma,4,Thu May 28 20:19:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for you thoughtful post. I was noticeably relieved reading it. My anxiety lowered a bit and some tension released.  It took me four years to feel like I was not looking over my shoulder expecting the ""specter"". Nothing at this point is known and as I read, the numerous other than cancer reasons for an elevated CEA are all plausible and applicable in my life.   Right now my mind is in an endless loop. ""My scan going to light up like a Christmas tree, totally inoperable, palliative care. To ""Hey it's nothing"" after all CEA's are notoriously inaccurate and widely variable.  I was not prepared for this call as it had been two weeks since the test. The results were to be mailed. I figured I was in the clear after a week passed. The tests usually take a ""few days"" so I prematurely put myself at ease. Again Thank You for your post. Its just what I need for the day."

cancer,37nf4q,bellasarah,2,Thu May 28 22:35:30 2015 UTC,"I know you're being brief cuz internet, but ""weird"" isn't a helpful descriptor.  I'd feel more comfortable if i knew you were having post-nasal drip, sinusitis, ear aches, cough, sneezing, etc. to say its a reactive lymph node.  Trouble with HL is thats its more difficult to diagnosis than non-HL by less invasive procedures, so hopefully this doesn't prompt an excision of the lymph node, but that may happen.  If anything, they may bump up your PET, though a reactive node may light up a little and still be a puzzle for your docs.  Just try to put some faith into the onc's physical exam tomorrow.  Best of luck."
cancer,37nf4q,billyvnilly,1 point,Thu May 28 23:41:47 2015 UTC,"I never really had B symptoms so I guess for me weird symptoms would be my chest pain (kind of in the middle right of the chest next to where my mass use to be), dry cough, small rash on my stomach, hair loss on my lower legs and arm pits (but not any where else, my tsh levels were normal btw), and elevated heart rate. There are a few more but I honestly don't think they are very important like a very very low grade fever most days and a few other things...  I was thinking they might try and move my PET up or do an ultrasound? I don't know since I'm just a lowly wannabe-attorney and not a physician. Do FNA's not work on lymph nodes?"
cancer,37nf4q,billyvnilly,1 point,Fri May 29 01:04:38 2015 UTC,"I wasn't necessarily saying you should have b-symptoms... more flu/allergy/drainage symptoms...then id be more comfortable saying its a reactive lymph node...a physical exam would probably be as good as an ultrasound if you can feel it.  yeah thats sadly what i was referring to... diagnosing hodgkin on fna is sometimes a challenge. hodgkins can have certain flow cytometry results, but they are nowhere near as specific like they are with non-hodgkins.  They could do fna, but a pathologist could easily just say, nonspecific/scantly cellular/etc., recommend excision.  I would look quizzically at a clinician if they wanted a diagnosis of HL off of a fna... but thats just me.  (this is just my opinion... wait till you talk to your onc). :) hopefully this didn't come off as condescending... lawyers aren't lowly :p"

cancer,37h8e5,Lilleskygge,2,Thu May 28 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"Hello, I'm cupcakesupreme and my husband was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer (adenocarcinoma which decided to make it's home right where the rectum and sigmoid colon join) on March 19.  We don't know how many lymph nodes are affected as he is going through chemo first before his surgery, we just know that several lit up on his MRI.  This is my husband's third time fighting cancer has he was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma when he was nine, and it reoccurred when he was 11.  High: husband and I went out for ice cream last night so he could enjoy the cool treat before his next round of chemo (one of the drugs he is on is oxaliplatin which gives him terrible cold sensitivity).  Low: husband was supposed to start his third cycle of chemo on Monday, but his hands are drying and peeling like crazy from the Xeloda that his oncologist felt an extra rest week was needed.  His oncologist also figures that, because of all the chemo my husband had as a kid and some of the long term side effects from it (hyperplasia being one), his liver cannot process the dose of the chemo at the same levels someone who has never had cancer before and his body is behaving in a way to suggest he is being ""overdosed"" by it.  His dose of the Xeloda will be reduced, but the oncologist gave us something positive to consider by this: if the Xeloda is causing the healthy cells in his hands to go crazy, imagine what it is doing to his tumor."
cancer,37h8e5,cupcakesupreme,2,Wed May 27 20:42:55 2015 UTC,I hear you about the xeloda.  I only took it for four weeks but it did a number on me.  Serious diarrhea and the peeling on the feet  - it hurt.  I hope it did a number on my cancer cells!

He has been relatively lucky with the digestive side effects, but it did cause abdominal pain mid way through his first cycle (figured out it was the Xeloda after it happened at the same time during his second cycle).  We went to the ER and they gave him a CT and it did show that the tumor had already started to shrink after the first cycle of chemo.  While the side effects haven't been easy, it helps to know that the treatment appears to be working."

I also felt palpably, that I was dying when it was in, each day heralded further descent into decrepitutde, but again i was so used to that i didn't realise how bad the effect was till the tumour was gone.  The first few days after surgery will be awful of course, but sometime after a week of healing from surgery I started to realise that finally i was going to be out of that ever increasing pain and it got better every day as I healed.

I gained a bunch of weight when I had steroids for Crohn's disease though so I believe ya.  As for getting horny I'm outta luck except in reddit porn sites. Plenty of those I guess.

cancer,37bloq,ulysses_was_good,5,Tue May 26 12:45:40 2015 UTC,"Hi, shitty news. There's no right way to cope with it to be honest, but you do. My mother died before I was 21 and she was 54. We had a wedding ceremony for her and my now stepfather (A lovely italian guy I encouraged her to reconnected with via fb after 30 years) We both managed the final stages at home because she didn't want to die in a hospice. I really don't know what to say that can make you feel any better, I'm sorry for that. She stayed pretty alert till the end even due to the massive amounts of hydromorphine etc but I've heard that's unusual. I don't want to be a downer but was told by doctors she had a 70% chance of getting through it, but died after a few months. Her sister had gone through the same thing 10 years earlier and I believe she gave up the will to live pretty quickly after diagnosis. One thing I'm very glad I did besides find her lost love, was to record her voice talking to me. She recorded a message of eternal love for her only daughter while I was lying next to her on the hospital bed we had in the house I grew up in. One day about a month before she went, we were in the hospital grounds and she asked me why I thought some people get better and some don't, I looked down at the multi-colored pebbles at our feet and told her that some of them were the sick ones, some were the ones that got better, others were the ones that died. There is no reason or right way to feel, I send you all my love and hope that she will get better. If you want to ask anything at all or just want someone to listen, I'm here."

It's not negative nor positive but realistic and I can tell you speak from experience. It has now been about a month since the diagnosis and I am getting used to the ""feeling"". It's a weird experience to say the least.  My mother had to fly to another country to get treatment since where I am (canada) has excellent doctors but the most congested, horrible system that has ever lived. I can't be there with her and it hurts to be away from her. She is scared but I think about her and talk to her every day. I am sad to hear about your mother, may she rest in peace and may you find peace. I am also trying to find a therapist whom I can talk to for my mood swings that I had before but that is getting progressively worse.  I don't know know what to say- it feels so weird to see your mom getting weaker via skype. Every time I see her she's a different person. It hurts so much inside, it feels like someone is stabbing me. I am trying to not be affected by it and thankfully my friends are very kind to me, but the feeling of loneliness like Im on an island by myself is hard to shed. Anyways, thank you for your advice."

My mom recently passed away, and although it was not a shock, it's still incredibly difficult and sad. I would recommend accepting any help that is offered, and ask for specific things when you need them. Make sure that you are fitting in quality time with her, meaning if you take on a caregiver role, enlist or hire some help so that you are able to just be there as her kid sometimes. I felt glad to have had the opportunity to have sincere talks with my mom while she was sick that I might not otherwise have had if she passed suddenly/unexpectedly. Take everything one day and a time and breathe. I wish the best for you and your family."

cancer,37bloq,SolipsistRB,3,Mon Jun 15 13:31:12 2015 UTC,"My mom died last year from colon cancer. She made to two years from her diagnosis. I agree with the other posters: make the most of the time you have. Realize that she may become angry, or depressed, or reclusive. There will be family issues about her care and what's best. Weather it with her. My mother's last two weeks were in home hospice. I fed her, took her to the bathroom, wiped her bottom, and told her i loved her.  In the end, she was afforded the dignity to die as she chose with the people she chose. I think that even though it's still heartbreaking that she's gone, the fact that her wishes were followed makes it a little easier.  My heart aches for you. Be kind to your self, and give yourself permission to feel everything."

I want to say that I do feel your pain and can relate in some small ways, although I cannot imagine what you are going through. I hope you find peace. I have been trying to reach therapists and cancer support centers but they have a backlog of people asking for help. I put myself on a waiting list and meanwhile am here, wondering and reading. You are right, ever since the diagnosis we have been arguing on what to do, how to do it, when to do it. It's been rough, I have been obligated to work every day. My parents have a lot of debts and me and my brother has emptied our savings and basically threw away any hope of buying a home for us and our partners. I am quitting school because I can't pay for tuition. I already feel like my life is ending with my moms. Its really, really hard to be poor and to have a mom who has cancer.

I am mostly on this reddit thread, reading other people's stories. Its actually helpful because I feel so alone- as much as my partner and family are sharing this pain, I feel completely isolated.

cancer,37akco,blameitonthewookie,2,Tue May 26 13:30:48 2015 UTC,"The way the doctors have talked, it seems like they will take care of it whatever it is. It's just the way that they told me some of the news didn't sound too good. I know most people overthink things when cancer is in the conversation, and I'm probably guilty of it.  As far as the biopsy goes, they told me I have to fast and have someone that can drive me home, so I imagine I may be put under general anesthesia. I suppose it's all contingent on the ultrasound, so I may have a surgical biopsy or needle.  It seems that I may have the results back that day since it's going to be early morning, is that similar to your situation? My ENT doctor said pretty much if the ultrasound shows anything solid, I'm going to start working with a cancer specialist, so I'll know pretty quickly if it is cancer, but it will take a while for the other tests for type and stage as far as I'm understanding at this moment."

What he's doing now will be my eventual end as well, and I am not looking forward to it at all. I've specifically avoided excessive opiate use because I'm afraid of building tolerance, and when I get there, I want the fuckers to work as well as possible. Thankfully, folfiri still beats down my lung and bone mets well enough to keep them from hurting too much, but any time I'm not actively on it, the coughing is unbearable. I even cough so much it makes me vomit.   What clinical trial is he in? I'm always on the lookout for a new one. I was offered one last month, but the company's own data from previous studies showed it to be virtually ineffective vs KRAS Wild-type tumors, which I am, so I passed it up. I didn't want to waste my time on a drug that wasn't going to do me any good, and I didn't want to take a spot from someone who might be a KRAS mutant who could actually benefit from it.  One thing that I do use when the bad feelings start creeping around is to think about the whole clinical trials thing. I figure my life already blows ass, it's not going to get much worse whether I take these drugs or not. I may, however, be able to prevent someone else from having to deal with it if a trial I'm in results in a newly FDA approved drug. It's admittedly a very small consolation, but it kinda helps with the whole existential crisis of ""what will my legacy be?"" Maybe I can make it be a new drug that keeps people from suffering like I am. That's worth something."

Even with a trial available, at this stage for him it could mean months more of agony with very uncertain benefits. I think maybe letting go is an option that should be explored with your brother.  At the very least it will show him that you are listening, hearing his pain.  Trying to make this choice probably gives him a sense of power in what must feel like a powerless situation.  Have an open, gentle discussion about it.  if possible, include a counsellor.  It may give him strength,  or it may help you understand his reasoning."

cancer,37a0pg,sb11345,1 point,Tue May 26 04:13:38 2015 UTC,"At that point, as others have said have you considered palliative care, they are usually a bit better about providing adequate pain relief, and has he mentioned assisted suicide and if so are you willing to help him access that in a state that provides it?  Not mentioned is an out of the box option - did you consider a methadone program for him. Methadone is about the most hardcore painkiller available, horribly addictive, but with his disease load the long term impacts aren't an issue. It's something I have considered if the pain gets too much and the oncology specialisation can't deal with it.   Getting an appointment with a methadone clinic doctor and telling them the truth - terminal cancer has given him a massive addiction and tolerance to opiates and he's either going to need to source adequate relief illegally on the black market, commit suicide or get an opiate that does the job and plugs the addiction and pain gap - methadone.   I don't know anyone who has done this, and I've never heard of anyone who has gone this route, but several pain relief in terminal cancer studies I've read have cvoncluded that ultimately, when the other opiates stop effectively relieving pain, methadone can still keep a lid on the pain, so IMO it may be worth a try to access this drug for him however you can get it.  Another option is terminal sedation, they don't kill him, but they keep him sedated enough that he isn't in constant agony. This way you lose him though in a sense, he will still be breathing, but he wont be conscious. This is, as far as I understand, considered ethical within the medical profession, so it shouldn't be hard to achieve if you contact a hospice.   Anyway, discuss which ever of these options you think are worthwhile with him, see what he thinks.  Fortunately I'm not in this situation yet, have managed to avoid opiates so far outside of post surgery, so they'll work when I need them, but like your brother I fear that at some point they will diminish in efficacy and I will be left in pain. i will choose suicide at that point personally.   I wish you the best and hope he finds relief ASAP, in whatever form he prefers that pain relief takes."

His dad is in good hands at the hospital and they'll do what they need to ease the pain. Also remind your friend that he also need to take care of himself, to not forget his needs.

I had that experience when I was 26, and found out that my leukemia is a particularly aggressive and difficult variant. I understand the fear - as my cancer has low 5 year survival rates, and I was worrying whether I would even go into remission with the treatment. I am still here and still in remission 1.5 years later. So I would try not to worry about the prognosis right now; you are a statistic of one, and as Stephen Jay Gould famously wrote The Median Isn't the Message. The initial shock and coping after diagnosis is probably one of the toughest times, but it gets easier. Well, I hesitate to use the word ""easier"", since what I really mean is that you just get better at coping with the reality of the situation. If you need help coping, don't be afraid to ask a professional.   I'm glad that you were able to have a good time at the nightclub. It's hard to feel like you're even able to have fun when you get a nasty diagnosis, and I hope you keep having fun in spite of the cancer. I wish you luck in the coming weeks."

The post-surgical nerve pain/possible adhesion pain is killing me since the operation, which had major complications. Sepsis is scary as hell. I'm out of Percocet because I forgot to call my doctor on Thursday, so I've been really put through the ringer this weekend. I'm also still very tired and tire easily. I also got to have outercourse this week, which rocked."

cancer,3751hr,pointywalrus,3,Mon May 25 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"Most of your questions will boil down to lung function, surgery, and chemo/rad.  According to their tests, how well do his lungs function now.  Is his cancer resectable?  How big of a surgery will that be? how long will the recovery from surgery be? how well will his lungs function after the surgery?  will he receive chemo and what kind, and for how long?  Same with radiation.  Get some idea of the timeline for the treatment.  as you said you dont yet know some things.  Stage (the size of the tumor and if it has metastasized to lymph nodes or other organs yet) is very important to know as is the histology.  if its non small cell (adenocarcinoma or squamous) that is much better news than if it is small cell."

First of all we found out that he had a shadow on his lung. Then he went for several scans. These scans, I think it was the PET and MRI scans, were to establish whether or not the cancer had spread and how large the cancer was.   After this, he went for a Biopsy, this was to establish how large the tumor was again I think and to confirm it was cancerous.  Then, we went for his first meeting with the Oncologist, this was the doctor that specialized in the Cancer and it's treatment plan.   The oncologist discussed the type of chemotherapy and whether or not it was operable. Unfortunately, in this case it wasn't. He starts his chemotherapy treatments in a few weeks time.   I have personally found the hardest part of the process in the waiting and uncertainty. Now that I know what we are facing, I personally feel it is easier to deal with. Then again, i'm a male and I think it's part of our practical nature.  Either way, I hope that you can find some help/answer in at least portions of what I've written here.

A bedside table, oxygen tanks, etc. Anything to make it easier to help him and things to improve his life. If your husband is as weak as my father was the bedsores will not go away so easily. Hospice provided something akin to an air mattress to make it softer on the sores so he felt less pain from it.   Anything you need, all you have to do is call them and they will provide it to you. It's 24/7 so anytime you just don't know what to do anymore or need help, you can call them.  Please, if you husband insists on no Hospice at least get someone to help you. Friends, parents, I'm sorry but I have no idea who is easily accessible and who is willing to help. Just don't do it alone and don't bottle the pain.   Nobody knows when it's their time to die. And for a time, it really sucked to wake up every morning and wonder if today was the day. But when my father didn't eat and didn't drink anything, I knew it was close...so close. Feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to or just to vent or anything really and I wish you the best of luck. big hugs"
cancer,3726to,blackroserandom,6,Sun May 24 05:34:33 2015 UTC,"I also can recommend getting an air matress, it gave so much comfort to my dad when he begun to lose weight rapidly. The oxygen tanks, also. Not sure if it's possible in the States, but we had a nurse come in daily to change his saline and morphine drips and see if everything is ok. Also applying a catheter closer to the end. Dying at home is a wish for many if not most Finns. My dad died a few moments after our last family member came into the house so he definitely knew he was surrounded by family in his own home, which in a way gives me comfort also."
cancer,3726to,harblrgrl,3,Sun May 24 07:27:19 2015 UTC,"My advice, for what it is worth, is to take him to hospital/hospice. You need help. He needs more pain relief than you can give him. I wanted to take my dad home, but the nurses knew we couldn't handle it. Take the help. Then you can focus on making every minute count and let the professionals do the tough stuff. I am so sorry you are going through this, as I am for everyone going through this. You can pm me anytime xxx"
cancer,3726to,burstabcess,3,Sun May 24 11:19:03 2015 UTC,"We just went through this with my dad. He was very intent on being at home. We had a hospital bed brought home, a  wheelchair and a few others things. These are essential. Whether he wants strangers there or not, you need to have certain things in place.   Like others suggested, have someone there with you. You can only do so much for him now, and he needs to realize that this is an awful thing you're going through. Having someone there makes all the difference, it's too much to do b yourself. My step mom was my dad's caregiver right to the end so I really can relate. Our nurse came and got us all of our medications ready and helped us move him around when he had bed sores. She was a saviour. You need to have someone like that, we were lucky because my dad loved her and had known her since he was diagnosed.   I'm not going to lie to you. It's not going to be easy. I'm sure you know that. Having to watch someone you love deteriorate is awful. We tried to stay positive, we kept him as comfortable as possible. Near the end his liver was shutting down and he was in a lot of pain and he was basically just sedated the last few days before he passed in his sleep. So be prepared to talk to him about whatever you need to before things get worse. It progesses so quickly.  I'm so very sorry you have to go through this. It's so unfair. But know that in the end we felt as much relief as grief; he was finally pain free and no longer bed ridden. He was happy to go and went with a smile on his face, in his sleep.

cancer,3726to,dogsandpeaceohmy,1 point,Sun May 24 15:21:57 2015 UTC,Hospice is your best option. They can be as involved or not involved in his actual care as he wishes. So they can set his meds and all of that and do checks on him but you could still be his primary caregiver.   My father in law died in a hospice center from lung cancer. It was fast. He stopped responding to us for the most part and stopped eating and drinking about 2 days before he passed. We had to have him in the center because they thought he was doing better than he was and we're trying to stabilize him. He went downy pretty fast.   My mother in law died of pancreatic cancer. She died at home with hospice. It was so peaceful. She had enough medicine to be comfortable and was surrounded by family. She was on her sofa and the nurse was there but in the background. She kind of guided us as the night progressed and my MIL was closer to passing. It was such an easier experience on us as a family. We saw that she wasn't in pain and knew what stage of death she was in. I can't thank that nurse enough for her kindness.   My heart and thought are with you.

That being said, we still contacted a hospice group that could come in and help her. One person can't do it alone. I understand wanting to follow your husband's wishes, but it is unfair and incredibly difficult for you. It's ok to call hospice and have a nurse come and check on him with you. A nurse can help you care for him properly, turn him, change sheets and other things, and give you time to do things like grocery shop or care for yourself. You will both be better off and more comfortable."

cancer,3712x5,notaspookorgook,1 point,Sat May 23 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"Hi,  My mom passed away from liver cancer about a year and 5 months ago. She was given 3 months to X amount of years depending how treatment worked, obviously it didn't work.   I want to tell you that you should plan for death within a reasonable time frame, such as 1 year depending how bad the cancer is. They diagnosed her in may 2013 for late stage cancer, then a few months later it accelerated down hill even with chemo. My mom's liver cancer metastasized to lung and stomach and to the bone/blood IIRC, next thing you know, entered ICU thanksgiving 2013 and died 1 week later . You should really find out how serious it is to piece out a timeline. While it may sound negative now to sort all the legal and financial aspects of your father's death now, it'll save you the stress if worse comes to worst happens. You don't want to have a pile of financial and legal stuff to do in your darkest hours.   I suggest you go do things with your dad that you think he might miss out on with you. If you haven't graduated school yet, take a graduation photo or pictures of potential milestones he might miss such as first job etc."
cancer,3712x5,Kyoteey,2,Sun May 24 04:29:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's much better to find out what your father wants than to do something and wonder if that's what he wanted.

It is important that you are honest before feelings get deep, but if he knows and still wants to be with you, do not feel guilty. Try to remember that he made a choice to continue to be with you. You can only be guilty of something you caused or control, and you dont control his choices. Talk with him, or someone, about your feelings. But dont dwell on guilt. It isnt your fault you have cancer."
cancer,370c5l,Kurgon999,1 point,Sat May 23 20:58:05 2015 UTC,"That sucks with the liver transplant scenario you've got to face.  Waiting for something out of your and your doctors' control was something that frustrated me as well.  I also kind of resorted to just the flash-in-the-pan hookups and haven't yet been able to figure out how to make a sustained relationship work.  I don't know what issues exactly you mean, but I can almost relate with a story I heard about Vietnam vets who didn't really feel comfortable talking with people in their home towns after returning from some soulless fighting.  Once they reunited with their military buddies, it was good, but it's hard to find people to understand everything one goes through sometimes.    I'm cancer free now and working to ""normalize"" life as much as possible.  If anything, I'm kind of open to the idea that I have had an experience not many people have had to face and just own that and try to live as bad ass as possible.  I do try to do the dating relationship thing, but I'm not going to not acknowledge how the cancer diagnosis and treatment affected my life and outlook on life and try to be someone I'm not just to make a relationship work.  You nailed it too when you say that cancer is an experience you didn't even want in the first place.  It's such a shitty deal, but I think one just have to try to make the most of the situation.

cancer,370c5l,bookingly,1 point,Sun May 24 00:16:32 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I don't think I had to go through as much as what you are having to go through.  For me, the tumor was located in my upper left leg.  The deal with myxofibrosarcoma is the risk of metastasis to the lungs (which to my understanding would more or less mean game over) or continual recurrence of the sarcoma at the area of the resection, which would lead to many surgeries in a localized area or maybe just old fashioned amputation of the leg.  The biggest issues I had to deal with was an extended hospital stay for just over a month straight in the hospital for treatment of a pretty belligerent infection that had emerged in my leg.  A really unusual condition had occurred in my body where it seemed that the sarcoma tumor caused me to have acquired Von Willebrands disease, which is a form of anemia (like they had never seen that happen before, even in the available literature).  Because of the anemia, when I had biopsies of the leg performed, the wound didn't heal effectively, and me trying to stay in college living in the dorms inevitably led me to developing an infection at the site of the biopsy.  So basically just having to stay in that fucking hospital for like 37 days straight trying to get that fucking infection taken care of so the bad ass surgeons and doctors could take out the tumor and allow for my body to recover was one of the biggest pains to go through.  Then the recovery process after was not the easiest because the removal of the tumor involved taking out a lymph node, which led to me developing a bit of lymphedema (swelling of the body) in my left leg.  I guess couple that with going to a university where everyone seemed to be leading perfect, cancer-free lives, and I was kind of fucking depressed for a bit having to deal with all of sudden realizing my body can kill itself pretty quickly.    The only reason I know about how much of a pain the organ transplant process can be is that there was a guy I met who needed a heart transplant, and he told me just how much of a process and waiting-game it could be to get a new heart (he eventually did get one, and even though there were some complications after the surgery, he got through it and looks pretty good overall).  So yeah, you have a difficult situation, but if you ever want to talk, feel free to reach out.  Again, just try to remember you have an experience that is pretty damn unique and it can be really hard for people to understand just what you are/have gone through.   I would suggest to just keep trying to find activities you can do and incrementally do as much as you can to try to make whatever you consider progress to be.  It is a lot easier to try to make the next couple hundred yards on a hiking trail than it is to think about hiking the fucking mountain all at once.   Also, be sure to try to surround yourself with people you feel like you can talk to.  I really try to make an effort to keep up my friendships and keep that communication line open to people I feel I can really share things with.  Having people that have your back and have a least a general idea of what you have gone through is really invaluable in my book.    Also, I like to keep up with the news and people I find remarkable, because people go through some pretty incredible struggles, and it can be inspiring to realize what others have gone through while maintaining some sort of dignity through it.  Also, life has no guarantee, and it can be fucking crazy out there and sometimes that craziness finds itself close to home as it were."

Antibody drug conjugates are very effective for some types of cancer.   But it all depends on the genetics behind the cancer.

cancer,36xhbk,LoveMadeMe,1 point,Sat May 23 06:22:45 2015 UTC,"The ""induction"" phase of the Adkins diet is pretty close to no carb. In most cases, you can simply omit the starch from a meal and eliminate almost all the carbohydrates. ""Starch"" means potatoes, rice, corn, bread, that sort of thing. It's not the end of the world, people do it voluntarily all the time. There are many recipes and blogs offering full meals. I get good, tasty results from a former Food Network chef named George Stella, he's got some books out.   I just cooked a pretty amazing ratatouille that qualifies as low carb. Is entirely vegetables, with some meat and cheese thrown on for substance. No starch.   I'll work on adapting the recipe from the poorly-written, 35-year-old recipe book I found it in. What kind of carb limits are we talking about here? 10 grams a day? 40 grams?"
cancer,36xhbk,garygnu,1 point,Sat May 23 05:13:47 2015 UTC,"Most vegetables are non-starchy and low in carbs. Avoid legumes/beans, potatoes, corn, and peas and stick to other vegetables. Leafy vegetables are always great as far as many nutrients go like spinach, kale, Swiss chard, etc. Broccoli, peppers, onions, cauliflower, and carrots also will bring lots of nutrients. Fruits contain natural sugar and are usually shunned in low carb/no carb diets, but they could possibly be eaten in moderation.   You can buy a veggetti or spiralizer and make zoodles (zucchini noodles), use spaghetti squash, or a mandolin to slice zucchini/squash/eggplant and use them as noodles in a veggie lasagna (just roast or pat dry the ""noodles"" to remove some of the moisture and avoid watery lasagna).   Pinterest is a great resource. You also may want to ask her doctor if there are any nutritionists that can help.   PM me or reply here if you have any questions."

We all do it, but remember that rare things are called rare for a reason: they're rare.  There are dozens of other things that could cause your symptoms, cancer is just one, even if it's the scariest.  That said, I can guarantee you that your neurologist(s) had a possible tumor somewhere in their thinking, even if they didn't mention it to you.  They're trained to think the worst, too.  This isn't to say that docs never misdiagnose or make mistakes.  Of course they do, but that's pretty rare, too.  It's important that you have an open dialog with your docs.  You should feel free to talk about your fears with them without thinking you sound like a hypochondriac.  If you're afraid it's more serious than migraines, say so.  Ask them point blank and see how they respond.  Best of luck to you"

cancer,36vu78,Seymourington,6,Fri May 22 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"First, I'm so sorry to hear that this is happening to your father.  Rectal cancer is terrible for many reasons.  For one, it often goes undiagnosed for a long time, and second, it can be embarrassing and very difficult for patients due to the associated symptoms.  For what it's worth, in addition to being a survivor, I'm also a doctor.  While I don't have a huge level of experience working with cancer patients and their families, I've been involved in their care and the conversations regarding their health and treatment.  One of the first questions that I personally think every cancer patient should discuss with their family is:  What are the patient's goals?  There are certain facts that can't be changed; this is not a curable disease.  But at a point where all treatment is either palliative or life-extending, it's important to understand what the goals of care should be.  This is a decision your father has to make; he can ask you and his family for advice, but it's a very real and personal question.  How far does he want to go with care?  What sacrifices is he willing to make?  At what point is he willing to stop treatment:  When he can't eat?  When it's too painful?  Is he willing to get an ostomy?  What if he becomes confused and doesn't know who, where, or when he is?  The questions go on, but they are all very important.  These are extremely difficult questions for anyone to answer, and especially to discuss them with family.  But one of the greatest gifts he can give you right now is clearly communicating his wishes so that if or when the time comes, you will understand his choices in his care and, if needed, be able to help him make decisions about his care in the event that he is unable to do so.  It's also important that other family understand his wishes as well.  It can be challenging for other family members who learn later or become move involved in his disease as time goes on.  Ensure that others understand what decisions he is making and why, so that if the time comes, they will not be a roadblock despite their best intentions.  In short, I think it's extremely important to talk about the disease and the fact that it will eventually end your father's life.  While it can be awkward and painful, it will help ensure that your father's treatment and remaining life will be lived with dignity and respect.  I'd encourage you to continue to be there for him, and emphasize how important it is that he talk to you and the family about his goals and wishes.  If you find this difficult, as any normal rational human would, I'd encourage you to look into the palliative care services where your father has been treated.  They are excellent physicians and social workers who can help your father and you ask and answer the right questions, and help ensure his treatment is in line with his goals.  Good luck in the coming days; I hope your father does well.  If you have other questions, I'd be happy to help in the future as best I can."
cancer,36vu78,The_Gage,1 point,Fri May 22 18:16:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know how he's thinking about it yet. I know the oncologist sent palliative care folks to him, so she's starting him on that road, but he doesn't appear to want to discuss it yet. I will contact them and ask how to bridge the topic and when. You appear to think I should talk about it right now, I see. I'm just honestly not sure how to bring that up. I know he told me in the past that if there's no hope of recovery, he doesn't want intubation and that sort of thing, but I should make sure.   This was really a wonderful reply. Thank you so much. I'm actually his healthcare proxy so it makes these talks all the more important, and I appreciate your bringing them up. I don't know what else to ask at the moment."

Spend some time together and let her open her heart.  If she says things that hurt, don't worry and don't hold a grudge.  Bring out pictures, talk about life, ask her what she is feeling and be a listener.  She will want to know that you will be fine without her so its not the time to lose hope in front of her and talk about how lost you will be.  Let her say what she wants to say and make her even more proud than she already is.  Aside from the first bit of listening and allowing her to go to a comfortable place...do whatever you can at any waking moment.  3 AM run to get ice cream?  Sure, i did that and sat around and laughed with her.  Do what you can do and don't force moments to happen.  Listen to her verbal and non verbal cues and be that guy that ushers everyone out of there if you sense she is tired.  if she was like my mom, she is too nice to tell people to get out and let her relax.  Be strong, don't be afraid, and be helpful on her journey....   (all easier to say than do...)"

Whenever she cries, I put my arm around her shoulder and listen. I kiss her a lot, tell her I love her (which was something we never freely did before her diagnoses, or at all). In a way, this entire situation is very bitter sweet. Because my relationship with my mother has evolved so much. There is so much hurt that we have let go of, and so much love we are sharing...but just knowing that I am losing her, destroys me. I don't let on how I feel around her.

I spent years working out, watching my weight... quit smoking, quit drinking.  5'9"", 170lb, 8.3% body fat, poolside trophy... then I started to get tired... couldn't keep up with workouts... 38 years old... incurable bone cancer.  Isn't supposed to effect someone until 55!  Too tired to work out... too tired for will power... four years later, I'm a fat, drunk, single, tired 41 year old.  Fuck you cancer.  I hate you."

Its hard hating a disease compared to a person and I felt like telling ""it"" how I felt. I'm gonna check out Cynthia as soon as my son goes to bed lilleskygge.  Phosphoreign I had a semi lengthy response but my internet messed up on my and I'm fixing to give my son a bath so this isn't much compared to what I wanted to say before. But basically..  I'm sorry your having to deal with that. I really am. I have no idea what is mentally involved with having the disease. When we have loved ones who have it we see the effects but we don't feel then and we definitely don't know what its like inside the mind.  You've experienced first hand what's shitty about cancer. It comes from no where. Your healthy and doing things by the book and then bam out of no where you get the news. I know you probably feel cheated. I felt like my whole family and my mother especially were bring cheated. She was 43. And truth is we are...but they say life isn't fair right? And if life isn't fair then deaths the equivalent of the guy on the streets playing ""find the queen""."

cancer,36usyu,Bob002,1 point,Fri May 22 14:05:12 2015 UTC,Agreed. Call him often to make sure he knows you are thinking of him. The support from you will go a long way even if you just call to wish him a good day and ask how he's doing.
cancer,36usyu,blackroserandom,1 point,Sun May 24 05:45:02 2015 UTC,"I know each cancer patients experience is unique, but perhaps a ""chemo care package"" would be a nice thing for you to do. While my mother underwent chemo therapy she endured certain changes, like dry mouth, and dry lips. Biotene makes products to help with dry mouth and lip balm for the dry/chapped lips, of course. A warm fuzzy blanket is also a good idea, and a good book. Sometimes chemo can take hours. There are many little things you can give your friend to make the experience a little more tolerable and to also remind them that they have your support. I hope this helps!"

The suggestions already made are good ones."

Stage four is the last stage and means it's already spread and metastasized.  If he is not going to take any treatments, he may not have much time left.  Even with treatments, his time would be small.  I know you will be missing the money you are losing but you will not regret the time you will spend with him while he is still feeling good.  You may want to discuss hospice for him.  They are the best people in the world and will work with you at this stage of his cancer until the very end.

cancer,36tol2,psychotwilight,3,Fri May 22 03:30:09 2015 UTC,"My Mother was diagnosed April 1st, passed May 16th. Looking back, I would have done so many things differently.  My advice: Become informed. Become an expert.  I could go through many things that we experienced along the way. The obstacles, challenges, how to make humor in tough spots.  The fact is, it's too hard to take in this early in knowing. You almost have to grieve a little before action is taken.  My mother was divorced and I'm the oldest and closest logistically, so burden mostly fell on me. Still does.  More advice: Do everything you can to help. Transportation, errands, chores, doctor visits. Don't complain. Boy, do I feel sheepish for some of the things I whined about. Make a spreadsheet of everything - Meds, appts, financials, friends and phone numbers. Document progression, pains, ways you overcame obstacles.  Talk to Palliative Care, Social workers or Nurse Navigators and the oncologists themselves. Do not rely on your father to relay messages.  Ask for help. This is a full time job to the fortieth power.  Lastly: Take a step back everyday and reflect. How did you do today? Emotions running high? Breathe, refocus and plan the next day.   The important thing to remember is that your dad won't be himself all of the time. He'll be angry, say things he doesn't mean. Brush it all off and focus on the good parts.   I wish you the best of luck and better results than we got. Pm me if you need to talk. I would be more than happy to help.  Fyi, I'm pretty direct. I don't sugar coat things well. But seriously, I want to help."

But really thanks, if I'm ever feeling really completely lost I will definitely be in contact, and I appreciate the directness, I want to hear everything straight."

Taking the advice of a friend from work who regretted not seeing her mom more before she passed, I visited home twice the year my stepmom was dying of colon cancer some 10 years after her initial diagnosis. She was my stepmom for 30 years and a perfect match for my dad. I knew her as sharp and funny and businesslike my entire life, able to handle two jobs, a business, and a household of 4 kids. Then, she had a stroke and wasn't quite herself anymore for the last 9 months of her life. I went with her and my dad to what wound up being her last chemo treatment. I came home several weeks before she died to say good-bye. She was in hospice care in the house, lucid enough to talk and remember stories, but she was on a lot of pain medication and maxed out on her dosage. My sister and I visited with her for an hour; we talked about our lives together, traded stories, talked about her grandbabies. Thankfully, she was prepared, and the family was prepared. It didn't make losing her any easier, and it still stings like hell nearly 3 years later, but I feel like having the emotional closure of no secrets, all things said, all hard feelings forgiven, was a kindness to us all. I feel so lucky to have experienced this best possible outcome of a terrible situation that robbed my stepmom of health the last decade of her life and robbed my family of her."

If you lose all of the hair around your genitals make sure you walk around a lot , change your underwear, and keep dry.  If you let your sweat pool down there laying in a bed or chair you may acquire a super nasty fungal situation.  Essentially a super jock itch that is horribly painful and stays around awhile."

I can give my experience. My hair began to fall out around week 2, starting with my head. Since then my eyebrows have almost completely fallen out along with a majority of my body hair. However my beard and the hair on my head continually grows back but in a very thinned out state, not including my eyebrows. So saying that it is related to hair growth rate would probably make sense in this case as my eyebrows have always  grown considerably less than my beard and hair. However to answer your final question I can say that it is possible, as that is exactly what happened to my grandma after she finished her treatment 2 years ago. Just remember it'll all grow back in the end, and the best of luck with your treatment :)"

I shaved my beard, head, and arm pits as it was coming out really fast there too. Within about another 1-2 weeks the stubble left from shaving was completely gone. My leg hair and eye brows were the only hair that remained and did so for the remainder of my treatment. Pubic hair never grew back during this time nor did hair anywhere else on my body check back arms etc... about 6-8 weeks after i finished i started getting some peach fuzz on my head and face, about another week or so later it started ITCHING like i have never felt before.. another few weeks and the itching went away. its now been 5 months and i have some crazy different hair than i had before chemo but im happy to have it."

Is it possible that your dad is having combination chemotherapy and radiation to shrink the tumour? This is usually done with five or six weeks of daily treatments. It is very common with rectal cancer and used to reduce the chance of it coming back in the local area, as well as make the surgery easier. One important study showed that about half the people that would have needed permanent ostomies could actually be reconnected if they had this treatment, I don't think that outcome has been repeated in other studies though.    As it seems you know, an ostomy isn't the end of the world at all! Perhaps the best place to find support would be taking to the cancer centre about support groups or specialised nurses that could answer questions before it all happens.   Also, if your dad was a bit overwhelmed, call ahead to make sure there will be a chance to meet with the oncologists while you're there, instead of hoping they are around"
cancer,36pehx,beamseyeview,1 point,Thu May 21 04:22:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you - I feel like neither of my parents would want to ask about things, so I want to make sure when I can start taking him that there's someone for me to talk to. My brothers and I live a while away, so it's important that we be able to get solid information, not second hand and not third hand, and not ONLY acknowledging the worst case scenario.  I didn't hear anything about radiation, but I'll be seeing my parents this weekend. If we can talk about it discreetly (we're meeting up to help my grandmother move out of the home she shared with my late grandfather and liquidate their furniture, I'm unsure if this is a good time to tell her), I'll ask for more info from my dad himself."
cancer,36pehx,purplenv,3,Thu May 21 14:42:57 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed December 7th 2012, stage IV Colo-Rectal cancer, at age 36. (ie Terminal)  You didn't mention which country you are in, I am in Canada, and my information will be based from here, so YMMV if you are in the USA (which I am guessing is likely).  First, initial diagnosis is a crazy time. I could not imagine going to that appointment alone, and coming home with any bit of useful information. My initial diagnosis, as stated was stage IV. My tumour was significant, and was practically causing a full obstruction of my large intestine. In addition at diagnosis approximately 50% of my liver was metastasised. Following a colonoscopy to confirm, it was agreed that I would not be able to handle any chemo before having my tumour removed.  Considering that situation, I did NOT end-up with an ostomy, at any point, although it was a ""just in-case"" plan if the resection wasn't going to pan out, during surgery. They kept roughly 6"" of my large intestine, and were able to resection that to my small intestine.   Almost definitely the initial chemo will be a combination called Fol-Fox or Fol-Firi. These are your standard first line options. In my experience they were administered once every 2 weeks (over a few hours), with a pump that I would wear on my belt, and it would be removed 48 hours later. Chemo should likely be administered by a nurse, and your oncologist will not be sitting there with you, just in case you have questions. I saw my oncologist ever other chemo treatment. At times on different days, just prior to chemo treatments, to check blood levels.  If your Dad is not stage IV, he could have as few as 8 of these treatments, the proposed surgery, and then wait and see under close monitoring if everything is resolved. This very well could be the length of his story.  In contrast, here is what I have gone through as stage IV/Terminal diagnosis, with no intention of a cure, and only improving quality/length of life.   Surgery, large scar, 4 weeks recovery before chemo 16 treatments of Fol-Fox, I got this many done before I said enough because of the neuropathy in both my fingers and feet, that is very common with this combo. Normal maximum is 12 treatments. over 30 treatments of Fol-Firi, initially was easier but by the end, a comfortable BM was not something I could ever look forward to. Stopped because it was determined that the combination had stopped being effective. 8 treatments of Cetuximab. Stopped this drug as my CEA levels (tumour markers in the blood) showed this drug was also not managing the disease. Current day, I am currently sitting here, with no current treatment for over 4 weeks, trying to get coverage to get a Hipatic Arterial Infusion pump installed. This is only needed to manage liver mets, and would only ever be needed by your father if he is stage IV. If we don't get approval for the pump, I will start a drug called Stivarga. I have the pills sitting here right in front of me, but haven't started, because the pump has a more significant result, and the pills will keep me from having any surgery for a minimum of 2 weeks. Again this is only a treatment for liver mets.   So, unfortunately with the insufficient information your father was able to retain from his initial diagnosis, his path moving forward could be starkly different. To note, with current treatments, stage IV is not always terminal either. With new liver surgeries, they can actually regrow a functioning liver from what was initially half of your original liver. One of my chemo nurses went this route and was back giving me chemo again."
cancer,36pehx,purplenv,1 point,Thu May 21 04:58:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your response. We're in Canada as well, so having your experience helps a lot.   What factors made you unsuitable to receive chemo and radiation prior to surgery? Was it a matter of time/location of the tumor, or were there other factors like your physical state?   Are managing the liver metastases your only concern now (colo-rectal tumors all removed)?  If you don't mind my asking, what province are you in and how much of your past treatment was covered by insurance? (private or otherwise)  Thank you again, and I wish you the best with your treatment!"
cancer,36pehx,beamseyeview,1 point,Thu May 21 14:58:28 2015 UTC,"My tumour needed to be removed first, because of how obstructive it was. At the time I was not able to pass much more then just fluid.  Managing the liver mets are my only concern now. All scans (PET/MRI/CT) show no evidence of the disease elsewhere.  I am in S/W Ontario. My treatment was entirely covered by OHIP. As well, my home care was managed by CCAC (Community Care Action Centre) and is also entirely covered. I will mention however, part of the Fol-Fox or Fol-Firi treatment can also have a drug called Avastin added. This is an expensive drug, and Ontario covers it, but from my reading it is my understanding that other provinces may not.  The only time radiation has been mentioned for my treatment has been more recently with hopes/ideas/plans to manage my liver mets, with nothing panning out.  Feel free to ask anything else that may come up, before or after you are able to start treatment for your father."
cancer,36pehx,adnascentia,1 point,Thu May 21 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks again! Money was honestly the last thing on my mind until I saw your mention of coverage for the pump, and money problems really are the last thing any cancer patient or their supporters need. I'm glad it's possible OHIP will be able to cover costs."
cancer,36pehx,tarlack,1 point,Thu May 21 16:02:37 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, although they're really the same cancer, because of the anatomy, the preoperative treatment is often different between colon and rectal cancer.  Radiation is usually not involved in colon cancer but often is in rectal cancer.  The treatment in general is also different when liver mets are discovered up front.  It will be important to talk to the doctor about exactly the plan for your dad"

You will be in a group with other survivors. Exercise is looking like a great way to improve our long term outcomes, a minimum of 150 minutes a week. I did the program in Upstate NY and it was great. And absolutely eat right. All the fruits and veggies you can stand, something green with every meal, they should be the cornerstone of your diet. Eggs, beans and lean meats. Watch sugar, alcohol. When I did livestrong they had a nutritionist come talk to us, it was nothing new but nice to see it all in one place and have a doc to reference."

Your Cancer is very treatable at your age (I'm sure you've heard that a time or two) so it's exciting to be nearing the end of treatment! Getting a little depressed is normal because you've had all this eustress and you've been concentrating on ""the fight"". After all that there's this really looming sense of what is to come or even when you have the all clear this feeling of loss of purpose because it takes a while to get back to some of the ""normal monotony"" of your previous life. Maybe you decide to make some changes. No matter what if you find that the depressive feeling persists you should mention it to your doctor so that you can seek the appropriate avenues for assistance."

I have 3 weeks off in between and I was feeling so good going in to the week.  Then chemo totally knocked me down again, especially the fatigue and constipation.  high: not to brag or anything...but today I finally had a regular bowel movement, first in about 2 weeks.

I talked about it with my PCP and he helped me find some things that worked well for me during treatment so I was ""regular."" Or as regular as one can be on chemo!

cancer,36nxlr,hidemyrealprofile,7,Wed May 20 19:33:52 2015 UTC,I think the future will view those that work toward the legalization of assisted suicide as saints.  It's unconscionable that we are able to provide an easy passing for our pets while having to watch family members suffer for months.
cancer,36nxlr,gooberfaced,3,Wed May 20 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"Right, there was an old 'joke' that went along the lines of ""I wouldn't do to a dog what we had to do to grandma...""  IMHO this is not suicide, it is dying with dignity, choosing when and how you'll go. You shouldn't have to move anywhere to have that choice (more correctly no one should have the ability or power to say 'no'.)"
cancer,36nxlr,NEHOG,3,Wed May 20 22:51:27 2015 UTC,"Everyone in my family agrees with it. From a financial standpoint, when near death is certain and quality of life is non existent, it makes sense to allow for assisted suicide when people ask for it. Something like 30% of medical costs occur within a patients last 3 months of life (in general, not just cancer patients).  We are society living with blue-laws that were made by and for religious people, which in turn has led people to think that we are supposed to live forever.  Any reasonable human should allow someone to live their life and end it as they choose."
cancer,36nxlr,MechMeister,3,Wed May 20 21:13:13 2015 UTC,"I deny any government's right to stop me from killing myself. Fuck legality, If I'm going to die from my cancer, I'm gonna deal with it."

I don't think I would go that route, but then again, I don't really know because I'm not in that position thankfully. I think people should have the right to choose.    I think people forget that just because someone else chooses to do something, it means everyone else has to.  It also isn't as simple as those who are against it make it sound.  You can't just go to your doctor and tell them to write you a prescription because you'd like to die.  It is a process, and not very simple which I also think is good."
cancer,36nxlr,lovestherain87,2,Wed May 20 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"A few months ago I moved to San Jose, California to be closer to my boyfriend who was diagnosed with ALL last year. In that time I've seen him overcome all the obstacles cancer has thrown at him. He is currently in remission, but will still need a bone marrow transplant to get the all clear.  I've been with him on his worst days, when the Oxy has him out of his mind and talking about his fears. I had never before thought about these kinds of questions, but going through this with him they become more frequent.   With that said, I'll tell you that I believe we all have the right to choose how we live, and end, our lives.  While I hope that we don't have to go through that, I will support him 100%. No one knows the kind of pain cancer patients go through. Not even people like myself, who experience it first hand, at the side of their loved one.   I would suggest moving to a state which allows you to do that. While I'm sure your mother would like to pass more comfortably in her own home, it's going to be a long and lengthy battle with the state of California to do so. In the end, she may not have all the time to spare to fight for that right.   I hope all goes well, OP and best of luck. xoxo"

She is the most intelligent woman I have ever met and a highly sought-after oncologist but I have never seen her smile. She is terrifying. I suppose when you're in her position that's to be expected. She was polite for the most part and sugar coated nothing which he always appreciated. If you called her anything other than Doctor she tore a strip off of you.  His chemo nurses (one specifally) were amazing. And though it's not a good practice they definitely got attached to my dad. He brightened up a lot of other chemo patients lives and he was generally positive which was rare to see.  His one nurse who had been there since he was diagnosed chose to be our palliative care nurse and came over so much more than she was supposed to when we had him at home during the end, just to make sure we were okay. She cried and laughed with us. We will always have her as a close friend."

We don't exchange Xmas cards or anything, but we do secure messaging back and forth periodically, and when we meet in person we talk about some personal stuff too."

He came in to sit and talk with me during my chemo sessions outside of all things cancer, met my friends and family and I really appreciated that.

I'm 37, diagnosed with terminal cancer in Nov of 2012, have been on anywhere from weekly to tri-weekly chemo for the last 2.5 years. I've had a couple breaks here and there, but other than that,  constant chemo. No curative intent either, just palliative. It gets fucking old.  Just a few weeks ago I decided I wanted to enjoy the summer, and fuck treatments, I wanted to get out and do stuff, so I told my doctor I wanted a break. Doc's OK with that, he knows it's all about making me feel better, and if that makes me feel better, then great.  I made it two weeks. My newest metastasis (in my hip) started aching the day of the first chemo I skipped, and had me almost immobile by the end of the first week.

cancer,36jk8u,Imissmybear,4,Tue May 19 21:20:59 2015 UTC,"I was 34, couple years ago. My wife had been bugging me to get that mole checked out. My mom had been bugging me to get that mole checked out. It had been on my jawline forever.   Finally got a job with insurance again, but put it off until it started to itch, swell and bleed (from me scratching it).   Yup, my primary made me go to the demo that day, and he didn't let me schedule a return visit for an excision. Nope, I had to be late to ref a football game and did that with a big bandage on my neck.   A year later it spread. Some neck lymph nodes swelled up, but deeper surgery, radiation therapy, and some interferon seem to have taken cater of it for now.   I hope it goes as well or better for you. Welcome to the 30s melanoma club. You can join the subreddit, but nothing happens there except people posting pics of their suspicious moles."
cancer,36jk8u,garygnu,3,Wed May 20 00:14:10 2015 UTC,"If it's not too personal, can I ask what stage you were in? And how did it spread?  Did you notice more/different skin discolorations?  I'm kinda eyeballing my whole body now, ALL the time.  I'm covered in freckles... and even pimples under the skin are kinda freaking me out... I read that eyes can be effected, and I recently started wearing glasses... Now I'm worried that the melanoma is the reason. I tend to over analyze on a good day.  THIS?  This is taking it to a whole new level. Waiting a week or 2 in between appointments is killing me."
cancer,36jk8u,garygnu,3,Wed May 20 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"I started out at Stage 2b, teetering on 2c. My scans (PET/CT, MRI) looked clean, and two lymphoscintogram tests failed to indicate which sentinel node would be a target for removal. So I was good for a year.    When it spread, it was just me feeling two lumps under my skin where the jaw meets the neck, near where the original mole was. So back in they went. Many but not all the nodes they removed tested positive.   There was nothing on the surface of the skin. It felt like a big honking zit that neither went away nor came to a head.   Your demo will do regular visual checks, and should teach you what to look for. Also, just trust the scans. If it's spread enough to affect your vision, I would expect it to light up a PET/CT scan.   I'm a pretty easy going guy that just doesn't worry, so I didn't have much of a psychological reaction. Your oncologist's office will have resources for anxiety, use them, and don't wait for your next appointment.   Good luck"

In the end i arranged an appointment with free counselling service (Cancer Council Australia). It really helped. I think by scan you mean molescan/dermatoscopy, not pet/ct scanning? Garygnu I'm amazed that you didn't have more of a psychological reaction... The stage 0 diagnosis, which was really good news/the best case scenario, really threw me.

This probably really bad to say, but when I had skin cancer they just did a shave, then the biopsy, then the surgery. But my stiches were almost completely under the skin except for the knots. I don't know if the derm I had was just really good, but your doctor sounds kind of sketchy to me. If you have any more spots I would get someone else to check them out. Like really, who did the pathology that said stage 0? your doctor, or a lab? cause if it was your doctor that's pretty fishy IMO"
cancer,36jk8u,Lostinparadise2,7,Wed May 20 06:54:54 2015 UTC,"Bailie2 what OP has described is textbook melanoma management. First an excision, never just a shave or punch biopsy. The photo of the  'eye' and first set of stitches is a textbook excision. Mohs, shave and punch biopsy is never (in Australia) recommended for melanoma. We go straight to excision of suspected melanoma. The excised mole goes to pathology for diagnosis, and if stage 0 a wide excision (photo of larger cut with more stitches) is done. For me, these procedures were one week apart (the path took a few days, then weekend, then wide excision). I was axtually thinking how neat and professional OPs stitches look. I thin he/she is in good hands. Op: just had exact same experience as you, though mole was first imaged then rechecked after a month or so to see if it had changed (yes, it had-stage 0 melanoma). So looks like skin checks are going to be part of our lives now!"

cancer,36jk8u,Bailie2,3,Wed May 20 19:01:35 2015 UTC,"Well, the pathology report has Stage 0 on it... And below, it says my dermatologist and the second doctor agreed with the diagnosis... So I think it was the lab work. As for Mohs, everything I've read says that for melanoma and even suspected melanomas, Mohs is not to be used. The lesion must be fully excised. Mohs is really only for treating Basil and Squamous cell cancers. I will say, I was not happy with the thoroughness of my first skin check. I feel like once they saw my chest, they didn't really look at everything else closely, so I've rescheduled another one for the same day I get the stitches removed. Now that I've a confirmed melanoma, I think I can expect a more detailed inspection... Of not, I will absolutely source another dermatologist."
cancer,36jk8u,Lostinparadise2,1 point,Wed May 20 10:23:06 2015 UTC,"mine was squamous, so maybe that was the difference. I didn't have mohs, it was a tear drop excision.

Glad you had scc,  which sounds bad but believe me in the skin cancer lottery, scc is far better than melanoma. With melanoma 'find early, excise wide' is the go. Oftentimes even skin grafts can be required ( eg for a 2cm wide excison.) glad you caught your scc and have it under control/foing for checks."

I'm seeing someone for help but it's still hard and I don't know what I want in life anymore except I know that it's short and will end."
cancer,36j7g9,Acidsparx,4,Tue May 19 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"I'm 7 years out from treatment. I felt exactly like this. Still do, sometimes. My wife and I talk about how occasionally I'll ask a question, she will answer, then I will ask it again a few minutes later. I remember asking the question, but not the answer. Other things, too. I get some like chemo ""flashbacks"" if I get too exhausted. It's like all the symptoms come back until I stop for a few days and get enough rest. Other stuff, too. For a year or two, maybe a little longer, I would have more emotional breakdowns, particularly if I talked about cancer to someone, or thought about it a lot.  Other things could set that off, too. I thought a lot about whether or not going through chemo had been worth it, and the answer was no for a long time.   But I got past it. I probably should have had a counselor, but I didn't. I met my wife, and in developing our relationship, I think I worked out a lot of my own demons. Again, it has taken years, and I still have trouble with some of those thing. I still wanted to achieve many of the goals I had before, but those were pretty broad anyway (graduate college, get married, get a job) so they were too hard to keep with.   The difference for me was when I met those goals. I had a day of just listlessness where I felt like everything was done. I met my goals. Now what? I thought about it, then came to the elated realization that now I could do whatever I wanted. Thankfully, that sounded exciting to me. I could read or play video games and do sweet thing for my wife and be with friends and work a job I liked and etc etc.   Thing is, you have all of those options to you available now. Do what you want. Right now, that may not be much. It may just be ""get better"". So be it. That's a wonderful goal. Go find friends, hobbies, strengthen family relationships. Find your reason for living again.   You've had a terrible experience. You've been slapped in the face repeatedly with the fact that you WILL die, and you don't know when. And it is really hard to bounce back from that. In many ways, the person you were is dead. But not gone. That person is still you, looking for an invigorating breath to reinspire your life. You're different, but that, too is the nature of life.   What I do sometimes helps a lot. Like last night, after a rough day, the house was quiet, and I had a million things I wanted to do, but only a little time. I asked myself, ""what matters most to you?"" I didn't ask what I wanted to do. That  wasn't helpful. But asking myself what was most important revealed what I really wanted to work on most. I cleaned the kitchen for my wife, then worked on a Dungeons and Dragons game to play with my nephews and niece instead of playing a video game out of habit, then I painted. It was great, and it fixed my mood.   Recovering your passion will be a lengthy process, but you can do it. I found that I was less interested in some things and that I had a greater love of new hobbies. But by steadily filling my life with love, with fun, with great memories, I have built up a wealth of experience that fortifies me against my painful past. And now, when I think about whether or not going through chemo was worth it, I look at my hobbies, my art, my friends, my family, my wife, my daughter, my career, the people I've been able to help, the things I have planned, the people I got to meet and say goodby to, and I know it was absolutely worth it."

And when you're young the effect it has on your mind is so much worse. Trying to plan a future and build on your dreams feels impossible because you're still trying to rebuild after the cancer experience.   The good news is that it does get better. A year isn't really that long of a time. I'd still regard you as pretty fresh out of treatment. The best advice i can give you is take things day by day. Don't worry about next year yet. Because by then you'll be a whole different person. Concentrate on today and making today memorable. Don't try and keep these fears to yourself. Bottling things like this up can drive you mad and only feed the over thinking. Find yourself an outlet. I talk to a therapist and am almost totally open with my family. On top of that, i carry a book with me. Whenever I feel down I write a page or so. I let my thoughts out. The things in that book aren't always true. It's rarely how I actually feel, and more often than not it's horrible, disgusting stuff. Sometimes just swearing and scribbles. But afterwards I feel better.   It's great that you've posted here.

Once my body and immune system were back to normal functioning levels I threw myself into everything I could, I joined a fraternity, I started coaching swimming, I began reading more literature and participating in a lot of reddit discussions, but most of all I just shifted my mindset to trying to make my Cancer useful. I wanted to take what I learned from my fear and suffering and use it to help others.

I also known others who are told their cancer is terminal, but they get a second opinion and try other types of chemo and apply to clinical trials.   I know a woman with stage 4 ovarian cancer who was told by her first doctor there was nothing he could do anymore, but she got a second opinion, started doing a different kind of chemo which worked. Long story short, she is still alive after 12 years from her first doctor telling her she was going to die soon. I am telling you this just to give you a little bit of hope. In reality, she's the exception and she suffered a lot in those 12 years with 4 painful surgeries and a list of complications on her organs. It comes down to quality of life vs quantity. Your mom could try other options and they could extend her life for a bit longer, but most likely quality of life might not be good. Cancer is such a terrible disease. Sorry."
cancer,36h6hw,SammySamaritan,7,Tue May 19 10:48:10 2015 UTC,"It is impossible to tell if you are anemic with the numbers you provided. As the previous commenter noted the MCV is the average size of a red blood cell. The RDW represents the variability in red blood cell size - you could have the same MCV but if all the red cells were exactly the same size your RDW would be very low, if there were a mix of very large and very small cells the RDW would be high.   Anemia means having too few red blood cells as represented by hematocrit (Hct) or hemoglobin (Hgb). Often the MCV can help make sense of the cause of the anemia. This is not really the case for patients on chemo.  I typically pay little attention to MCV or RDW in patients on chemo. Most anemia while on chemo is due to chemo affecting red cell production. A high MCV in a person not on chemo can be indicative of a vitamin deficiency (folic acid or b12), and many chemo therapies can cause very high mcv's by mimicking that state in the bone marrow. Hence it is expected and usually a waste of effort to pursue the cause of a high MCV. The most common cause of a high RDW is a recovering marrow. Baby red blood cells are very large and thus as a person recovers from chemo the presence of a large number of newborn red blood cells will shift the MCV and RDW.  As to your symptoms with chemotherapy and radiation. I would agree that they would most likely be a side effect of Cisplatin. If you wanted to try to connect an elevated MCV to neuro side effects than you could argue b12 deficiency but your MCV is not that high and this is not behaving like a b12 deficiency. I have had a number of patients develop new tremors on chemo. They are typically benign. If they are bothersome, unexpected, causing patient angst, or progressive I send them to see a neurologist to make sure."

This took you a long time to write but you could have verbalized it in about 3 minutes which is 2.8 minutes longer than the explanation I got from my oncologist.   Hgb 11.6-16.1 g/dL  11.6  Hct, Final  33.0-45.0 % 34.2  They are low but not out of range. I also had 3 low blood pressure readings. It was the combination of these signs and symptoms that lead me to believe I may be anemic. And as I said, this is the second, most recent CBC w/Diff reporting similar.  Can I poke around in your brain a little more?"
cancer,36h6hw,Labrat33,4,Tue May 19 11:41:40 2015 UTC,Your symptoms are almost certainly unrelated to your CBC. None of what you experienced is due to anemia. I would guess that 80% of patients on chemotherapy are anemic and many far more anemic than you are.  Your symptoms deserve attention and discussion but I wouldn't worry about these counts.

I never tell my patients to just accept one physician's word. It's okay to ask for a second opinion and seek and oncologist with his PSA being that high, his urologist may refer him to one anyway.  I suggest starting the lupron and recheck the PSA down the road. Food luck to you and your Dad."
cancer,36g6vc,livinonthedge,1 point,Tue May 19 04:55:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear you are going through this. The urologist knows your father better than people on the internet, including the formal interpretation of the bone scan. Your medical advice should most certainly come from them and from the other doctors you see.  It is definitely reasonable to seek a second opinion. Since surgery is not an option, it would be reasonable to see a radiation oncologist to find out if there is any role for radiation.   From what you said, if the cancer has already spread to the bones then hormones (like lupron) are the right choice. Even if it hadn't spread outside of the prostate, because of the numbers you gave he would probably still be on Lupron for at least a couple of months before radiation.  For that reason, I don't think you're being steered wrong. Talk to the doctors about your questions, and if you would like a second opinion, get one."
cancer,36g6vc,beamseyeview,1 point,Tue May 19 15:24:29 2015 UTC,"I'm just trying to help my Mom and Dad understand all this, but thanks.  I think Dad will be getting a second opinion, but I don't understand why surgery is not an option.  It seems to me that you would take out as much cancer that you can, then you have less to treat with more possibility of success - right or not?  As to the numbers too, which number is more of a concern - the PSA or the Gleason score?  Will the Lupron affect both?  Also beamseye, do you think that a urologist is appropriate for this kind of cancer treatment?  And really -- thanks for taking the time."
cancer,36g6vc,beamseyeview,1 point,Tue May 19 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"If his prostate cancer was localized to the prostate (hadn't spread to the bones), the PSA more than 20 would put him in the category of ""high risk"" for the cancer coming back after treatment.  These patients usually receive hormone therapy when they are receiving radiation.  The Gleason score is intermediate (6 is low, 7 is intermediate, 8-10 is high), but is in all 12 cores which suggests it may be relatively high volume.    None of these numbers are all too important in deciding the treatment if we know the cancer has spread.  If it has spread to the bones, then the standard treatment is hormone therapy alone. Radiation could be used for local problems if they arise in the future.  If it hadn't spread - where I am, in most men your dad's age, the standard of care would be hormone therapy & radiation therapy to the pelvis.  Urologists are trained and experienced in dealing with this. There are  a subset of them (urologic oncologists) who are specialists in cancers of the prostate, bladder and kidneys that you could see if that's not who you're already seeing, or, again a second opinion from a radiation oncologist could be reasonable."
cancer,36f28q,MrPeL,2,Mon May 18 21:56:53 2015 UTC,"Mine came back gradually over a few months to about 75% of what it was pre-cancer.  My sex drive took a dive when I did chemo about a year after had my orchidectomy, but I attribute that to being less in the mood due to me feeling generally shitty. I hope you don't have to go through RPLND down the line, I'm stuck with retrograde ejaculation due to nerve damage from the surgery (a common side effect) that really reduces the pleasure I get from orgasms."
cancer,36f28q,unusuallytallgnome,2,Tue May 19 11:06:23 2015 UTC,"It took my husband a little over a month to even want to think about doing anything and I would say a couple months to be back to normal. It comes back, don't worry! Chemo makes you feel so awful that sex just isn't a priority for your body anymore. Totally normal. Just a side note, my husband also had an RPLND about 9 months after chemo and has retrograde ejaculation but it doesn't effect how his orgasms feel in terms of quality.  Edit: I think that hormone therapy isn't super common unless you have both testicles removed. Typically the remaining testicle produces enough testosterone on its own, but your doc can measure your levels if you are concerned after a time that he feels is reasonable. Best wishes!"
cancer,36f28q,DrXia,1 point,Tue May 19 12:16:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I have a quick question about the RPLND after chemo finished. Was it due to the subsequent blood tests finding something abnormal or was the RPLND just for security reasons? My oncologist hasn't mentioned anything about it and I just want to cover all my bases.
cancer,36f28q,DrXia,2,Tue May 19 15:58:23 2015 UTC,"Hey there! He was on his normal surveillance and a tumor was found in his retroperitoneal lymph node about 8 months after chemo ended on a CT scan. I'm not going to lie, it was totally shocking and devastating. Luckily, his tumor markers were totally normal- it was a teratoma and not malignant cancer again. However, of course, it still needed to be removed as teratomas can still cause a lot of damage. My husband had the RPLND at MSKCC a year to the day of his orchiectomy- 2 days before Christmas. Sucked big time, but we got through it one day at a time and he is doing amazingly. Unfortunately, a lymph node in his pelvis came up as ""borderline reactive"" a couple of weeks ago, so he needs another CT in September to make sure it isn't another teratoma. We can't get a break... :-( We are staying positive though and hopeful that its just inflammation from his surgery or something.   Unfortunately, in stage 1S nonsemenomas and above RPLNDs are actually quite common. The literature report lower number than the experts report, which we didn't know until we talked to Drs. Bosl and Sheinfeld at MSKCC.   Do you know about the NCCN guidelines? Its a good way to make sure your doc is on track with his suggestions because there are easy to follow flow charts for all situations. Let me know if you want me to send you a PDF or you want me to let you know how to get it.   Sorry for writing so much! I realized I blabbed a little bit!"
cancer,36f28q,SaveTheTwins,1 point,Tue May 19 19:26:32 2015 UTC,It will return but your body might not return to the same level.    Pending on how old you are will determine for how long it stays at a high level.  The better shape you're in the better off you are.  More muscle mass equals more testosterone production.  I have not helped my self by getting in better shape.  I finished 7.5 years ago and really started noticing a difference in my self around year 6.  After going to the urologist that my numbers were low.  I've opted for testosterone boosters over straight up hormones.   The current meds have an awful lot of side effects and inhibit natural testosterone production.  The trick is finding the best one for you.   I went through 3 different supplements before I found the one I use now.

cancer,36dzt7,beamseyeview,1 point,Tue May 19 16:38:35 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how to answer your question. Brachy is used with curative intent for localized prostate cancer. That's different than what the OP here is talking about which are treatments for prostate cancer that has spread outside of the prostate already.  Brachy is increasingly offered alone or in combination depending on resource availability and depending on the particular patient and tumour characteristics.  It is not always appropriate and not all men can have it.  It is well supported by evidence. Your dad's doctors can advise him better about which option is best for him

As soon as I noticed even a hint of a headache, I would drink a liter of water and take 600mg of ibuprofen (be careful if you have problems with neutropenia because this could mask a fever). Then, I would drink a cup of strong coffee (caffeine helps post LP headaches for a lot of people) and lie down for a few hours. This usually prevented them from getting too bad, but was frustrating when they came on in the middle of class or something and I just had to wait it out. Hope this helps!"

However, the thing he needs most is calories - in any form. You'll have to experiment with different foods, as taste buds change.  We found he liked high-calorie ""Cal Shakes"" mixed with banana.  If you're based in the states, you may be able to get a prescription for medical marijuana (think it's called marinol) which can help stimulate appetite  Raise it with your dad's doc, and see if the hospital can provide a nutritionist to give guidance  Good luck!

He says for several months now, but we don't have the size or any other information about it that would help us increase or decrease our suspicion cancer. This could be a cyst / acne, could be a benign change in his anatomy pushing his lymph system up, could be a benign mass, could be scar tissue, could be a superficial AVM, could be thyromegaly, could be a displaced trachea... The list probably goes on.

cancer,367sxr,ericredbike,6,Sun May 17 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"The good news is that testicular cancer is extremely treatable.   There is no such thing as a biopsy for testicular cancer. Going through the scrotum and taking a sample will spread the cancer, so the testicle is removed through the public area in a surgical procedure called an inguinal orchiectomy. If the doctor is talking about a biopsy and not an orchiectomy, DO NOT go through with it and find another doctor because they clearly know nothing about testicular cancer.   Having a testicle removed (from what my husband and guys we know that had TC have said) is not nearly as bad as it seems. Recovery is fairly quick and pain is minor, especially if you stay on top of your pain meds and do everything you have been told to do. You will not be able to drive yourself home after surgery because the procedure is done under general anesthesia.   Things to consider after you speak to the urologist: - Bank sperm. You just never know what can happen so its like an insurance policy for your future.  - The earlier this is detected/treated, the less treatment you may need.  - Your urologist will send you for bloodwork to check your tumor markers and at lease an abdominal/pelvic CT scan to look for tumors (particularly in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes where TC commonly spreads). You may also be sent for a chest x ray. These tests should be done ASAP.   You can find a lot of helpful info here: http://www.tc-cancer.com/forum/  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions!

So if they are going in there with a syringe, don't do it.   Dumb question, but I am insured with an HMO so will I be able able to change doctors if I want?  I am also worried about finding a different urologist because I live in a kind of small city.  Also much thanks for the link."
cancer,367sxr,DrXia,3,Sun May 17 05:20:57 2015 UTC,"No problem, very happy to help. My husband and I have been testicular cancer together and know just how much it helps to have someone to talk to- we are always here to help! We have learned so much along the way and are happy to pass it along.   I can usually help with insurance questions, but we have never had an HMO so I'm not 100% sure. I'm pretty sure with HMOs that you need a referral from your primary care physician, but again, not totally sure on this one.   In case it is ever necessary or useful to you, the experts in testicular cancer are primarily Dr. Einhorn (oncologist) at Indiana University and Dr. Sheinfeld (urologist) and Dr. Bosl (oncologist). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has TC guidelines that should be followed by all physicians in the treatment of TC.   http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#testicular  click on the link, click TC, and then register for free to get the PDF document if you are interested. It basically describes all of the different TC scenarios and the treatment/surveillance plans for each scenario. Having this PDF can help you know whether your doctor is on top of things (TC may be the most common cancer in men ages 15-35, but it is generally very rare overall so a lot of doctors don't treat many TC patients). If you have trouble accessing it just let me know and I can send you the PDF.   Remember, most men are cured after the orchiectomy so there is a good chance it is the only treatment you will need. Sending you lots of positive thoughts in the hopes that this will be the case and you can move on from this in no time!"

The recovery process for me was about 2 weeks (doctor gave me three weeks). I was allowed to walk directly after the operation and, because of drugs, I felt nothing the first day. The next day was more painful so take those pills as recommended by the pharmacist.   After one week I was able to move normally across the house and two weeks was enough for me to take my car.    In my case,  the surgeon did the operation through the abdomen, leaving a small scar. So if it's your case you will feel some pains everytime you cough or step up/down, but it was tolerable.

After your recovery you probably have to leave work sometime to pass some tests (Scanner, PET scan, etc).  Just to give you an idea, scanner is about 1-2 hours and PET scan required 3 hours to complete. And, depending of your results, you may required some radiotherapy/chemotherapy to eradicate this shit (I can't tell on that part because the surgery seems to be enough in my case and they are just watching me for the moment).   Normally boss are really comprehensive with cancer. I also recommend that you have someone with you in the whole process, even if you're far away from your friends. Even if it's an ""easy cancer"", this news is always hard to learn and you may forget some information during your appointments with the doctor and you will need someone to drive you home after the surgery."

Most of your questions can't really be answered right now since there's literally no information other than ""hypervascular mass"". So breathe, and try to keep it from your mind during the ""hurry up and wait"" phase. It will probably be a couple weeks before a clear picture of what's going on and what must be done develops, and it's so frustrating.

cancer,365qvc,evilchad,12,Sat May 16 12:06:41 2015 UTC,"I have stage 4 TNBC. I was diagnosed Stage 3 at 29 years old. Had chemo, bilateral mastectomy (BRCA1+) and radiation. The next year had my reconstruction and elected to have my ovaries removed.   The next year, I got my mets diagnosis at 32. I am 36 years old now and have No Evidence of Disease (NED). They were able to treat each of my mets recurrences (fatty tissue in my butt in 2011 and lung in 2013) through combinations of chemo, surgery and radiation.    My son is 6 years old (he was 6 weeks when originally diagnosed). I understand your struggle. I know the ups and downs between hope and despair. I struggle with a false sense of security because I've been NED for over 18 months. It gives me great hope that I'll be here for a long time. Then I remember that I've been there before and the cancer always comes back. Not knowing where or when keeps me on pins and needles constantly.   I don't know if there's a way to save your wife from this. But there are ways to support her in coping with it.   I live in Canada so we don't have to worry about finances to pay for treatments. We do have to deal with other financial burdens though. I went back to work full time about 4 months ago. Disability just wasn't making ends meet for us and I am feeling quite well. So we figured I should work until I'm back in treatment.   I'm more than willing to speak with either you or your wife if you think it would help. PM me if you'd like that."

That means just the first step has been taken (no reference here to the J word honest). We will never be the same which is a pisser.   There is this expectation that you will live life to the full (what the fuck does that even mean).  When the reality is just getting out of bed each day is wonderful but can leave you completely drained.   May I ask who you have to be positive for? With the cancer free diagnoses others think that means you will be back to normal, when what they mean is the way you were before. That is never going to happen.  Baby steps.  Four years a go I put a strawberry in my mouth and cried with the pain. Now I'm never going to eat them as they just taste like cardboard. However, I can now eat a tomato based sauce.   It's baby steps, baby steps all the way.  Also it may be that you are depressed and some chemical help might be needed or just some counselling. See if there is any available in your area.  Good luck and good health."

If we've been given the all clear from our oncologists, we just have to push forward and try not to look back. You should be proud if yourself- you had to deal with so much body trauma, making that amount of progress in just 3 months is remarkable. Our bodies are fighting for us and so should we. Just think about how much better you'll feel next month :). I'm five months post chemo and 9 months post surgery however I still feel myself recovering. My strength is almost to where it was before chemo and thinking that I'm so close to being in better shape than I was before treatment motivates me to work harder. It's so tough right now, I know. But 3 months ago you couldn't imagine yourself where you are now and just think about what will come out of the next few. Wish you the best!"

cancer,362poi,DeathNeyla,7,Fri May 15 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"Overall thyroid is one of the most survivable forms.   I was diagnosed at the end of July 2014. Surgery was exactly a month later. I was in the hospital for 8 days due to calcium issues (common). Two weeks after release from the hospital, I had a round of radioactive iodine (also common). I didn't have lymph removal until last month, so I'm still following up from that, which may include beam radiation.   Otherwise, very little changed for me, and will hopefully be the same for you."
cancer,362poi,Bob002,3,Fri May 15 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"As nobody has said it yet, if you are afraid and your insurance or country covers it, ask for professional mental support. Most hospitals have professionals that can help you manage fears, expectations and other issues that you might have as a result of your sickness. It can often be calming to unload some of your problems to a third party that isn't your doctor or immediate circle of family and friends.  Also I know nothing of your cancer (my knowledge has remained in my own little niche of testes cancer), but if you end up like me, you might get in a relatively young cancer ward which can be awesome as you are with people that are in the same age group as you. Also, most of the nurses (in my own experience again) are pure angels who know when to joke and when to emphasize. They can make everything so much easier.  One last thing, If you like sushi and other raw foods, hit it up now, (if you are still allowed), because you probably won't be during chemo or radiation. (this includes stuf like medium steak, that is the real torture)  edit: Oops, did not read the post of /u/Acidsparx"

It all has to do with how compromised your immune system will be. But your doctor will tell you everything in due time.
cancer,362poi,14mm,3,Sat May 16 09:34:20 2015 UTC,"I'm your age.  Just turned 27 in April.  Diagnosed with both papillary and follicular carcinomas in July of last year.  I had my total thyroidectomy on June 26th and then flew from Arizona to Washington on July 1st to look for apartments.  It burned a bit, itched quite a lot, and was a little sore.  I think I had very little control over my larynx the night following surgery, but my voice was back to normal the next day.  The pain wasn't that bad for me.  They kept me in ICU for monitoring my urine and calcium levels and whatnot overnight.  I think I spent two nights in the ICU and then another night in a private room before I was ready to go home, and the only reason they kept me for more than 24 hours was because of the serosangineous fluid that builds up in the cavity left by the removal of the thyroid that they need to periodically drain (they insert a drainage tube during surgery that's attached to a little ""pouch"" to store all that neck juice (stuff looked like a strawberry daiquiri).  I didn't know they'd be putting a catheter up my urethra until I went to use the restroom for the first time and it burned pretty badly.  That was an unpleasant surprise, but again not too bad and the irritation healed up overnight.  It took roughly a month for them to send the tissue to a lab in Massachusetts to be officially diagnosed, which was pretty nerve-wracking.  The wait was the most annoying part.  I'm lucky I had a really, really dedicated surgeon who had amazing bedside manner.  I went to my appointment alone when he gave me the diagnosis.  Guy sat there waiting for me to say something in case I needed to get emotional or vent to someone.  I saved that for the car ride home, but it was still a nice gesture that lifted my spirits a little.  I pretty much immediately started on a dosage of levothyroxine to supplement the now-missing thyroid hormone, but I would wind up going off of my medicine for a few weeks in order to gear up for my radioiodine ablation treatment (they give you a radioactive iodine pill that is meant to kill off any remaining tissue, and thus, any remaining cancerous thyroid tissue as well).  The low-iodine diet was horrendously frustrating and boring, dude.  I relied on matza crackers and unsalted peanut butter most days.  To be fair, if you can muster the energy to cook yourself meals from scratch or have someone do that for you with non-iodized salt, you probably can make it through without any problems.  I didn't have that luxury, sadly, and since we can't know for sure whether the salt used in pre-prepared food is iodized or not, we just have to err on the side of caution.  Ablation treatment didn't make me sick at all.  Took it and was fine.  I had to stay in my room with very little to do since all of my belongings were now across the country in a different state waiting for me to move there, so it was exponentially more torturous than it needed to be because my mind was so difficult to occupy, but again nothing too insane.  My follow-up showed next to no residual tissue left and they told me I was just shy of being declared ""clinically cured"", whatever that means.  Sounded good, though.  The night I got my good news, I boarded a plane and moved to Washington state.  I went from discovering my lump was a tumor and not just a swollen lymph node from a cold in the middle of June, to surgery two weeks later, to cancer diagnosis a month after that, to treatment three weeks later, and my results another week beyond.  I went through my entire cancer scare, treatment, etc. in the span of two months.  And THAT, if it surprises you, was the worst part.  It blind-sided me and completely threw me off of the positive changes I was making for myself.  My family did not handle it well at all, which caused an unbelievably huge amount of unneeded stress on my end.  I really hope things are okay and you wind up with papillary and can sore through treatment, man.  But keep your eye on the rest of your life.  Don't let this diagnosis rule over you or your loved ones.  The loved ones in your life that are your support system... please make them aware of what you need from them and what you don't.  Boundaries are going to help you, here, if you feel that you need them.  Give yourself room to breathe when you need to.  Time to cry when you need to.  Comfort to call a friend or loved one if you need to vent.  Life doesn't have to (and frankly WON'T) stop because of cancer.  Keep doing things that make you feel happy and fulfilled.  But stay on top of this.  No more putting things off.  I put off my lump for months because I couldn't be bothered, and I was lucky enough to get it removed before it spread to my lymph nodes, despite signs of angioinvasion (cancerous cells getting into the blood vessels of the thyroid tissue).  Long post.  Sorry.  From one confused young adult to another: Wish you love, happiness, and a quick trip through this ordeal."

Find friends and family you can confide in, if not see if you can see a therapist. You'll be dealing with a lot of feelings etc. This is also where you find out who your true friends are.

It was in very early stages and he's doing every thing naturally so unfortunately I don't know much about the radioactive stuff.  From what I know prostate cancer is one of the slowest moving cancers, so if it is in the early stages like your mom said then you shouldn't be worried. Stay strong and positive, for both your mom and dad.   If you can, and it's not too much trouble, keep us posted on how your dad's treatment is going. And on how you're doing. We're all here to support you! Hang in there."

I wanted to be able to eat those with out grief from someone. So I could say that yeah...I was eating fries..because that's what I could actually taste. But I also had 2 glasses of kale..beat..carrot and cucumber juice. And it made me feel good. All the best to you and your dad.
cancer,364o3z,pointywalrus,2,Sat May 16 03:55:47 2015 UTC,"The American Cancer Society has great recommendations for nutrition as well as being incredibly detailed. Do note that they recommend you ask before taking supplements - in my case I couldn't take vitamins with iron. Iron would have been detrimental to my treatment, so it was important for me to ask. Also be aware of herbs, e.g. st johns wort as they can interact with treatments - discuss that with the doctor as well.    There are also sections on how to cope with eating problems, taste changes, etc. Do read it. Proper nutrition may not cure cancer but it's damned important, and cancer patients have special requirements. Best of luck to your father.    Link here"

The constant over-sympathy annoys me at times as well, but it's just a conditioned response. They don't mean to annoy you, they just do.   Never attribute to malice that which can be sufficiently explained by ignorance.  I haven't done anything exciting, but I learned something, and that's always good, I guess. I learned that taking a break from chemo isn't something that my newest metastasis in my hip is going to allow. My doctor is retiring, and I've gotta find a new one, so I figured now would be as good a time as any to back off of chemo for a few weeks, heal up, and then get back on the horse (been doing weekly or bi-weekly chemo almost continuously for 2 1/2 years). Turns out the lump in my hip hurts like a motherfucker if I don't constantly pour 5FU on it. Folfiri is what made it quit hurting the first time, I guess I'll go back on that. I just wish it would control anything else...heh. Still waiting on the next drug trial."

He said he didn't have the spare 70k laying around, so he took the buyout. He's been threatening to retire since before I got sick, so I kinda knew it was coming. He's 79...can't blame him.

cancer,364co6,acancerpatient,1 point,Sat May 16 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"Good morning!   23f, astroblastoma.   Surgery 05, then had proton in 09, then surgery in 14.    Congratulations on what sounds like as good of news as can accompany 'hey, you have brain cancer.'  I don't have a pineal tumor, sorry.  I can sympathize somewhat, an astroblastoma also qualifies as frustratingly rare. I've had it for 10 years and never met someone who has one too.  I wish you good luck in your search :)  As to proton - I had a 30-segment treatment for mine which covered a fairly significant portion of my brain - the original tumor cavity was around 4-5 centimeters, and they wanted to get any tendrils which might exist. I would imagine a similar logic was applied to yours.   Symptoms and effects were why I chose to get proton over traditional radiation, and I think the way to look at it is a comparison.  Both traditional and proton carry risks of harm.  In my case, traditional would have left me blind, destroyed any short term memory I had, and cut 10-20 iq points off.  Proton, for me, carried the possibility for the same damage, it was just less likely.  I don't know if you've spoken to a doctor regarding traditional and what the predicted effects would be; I absolutely recommend looking at all options and taking the time you have available to think it over.   The good news is that what I actually experienced was fairly mild.  The only real damage I might have suffered was a touch of short term memory, but I think that's just my excuse for being forgetful.  I was a bit tired during the treatments and for a a while after - it takes a while for it to leave your system. I didn't even lose my full head of hair, which to me was a good indication of the precision of it compared to traditional.  I shared so many of your concerns; when I received the treatment I was a senior in high school attempting to enter engineering school. Side effects had real consequences, and still do to this day.  And even after the treatment I got my degree last year (which I say to show that is still possible to live your life, not to brag or attentiongrab.)  Now, the stipulation with all this is that every person has a different situation and a different cancer and reacts differently.  I've read other stories on reddit from people who didn't react as well to proton as I did - I had a very positive reaction. So, as always, do your homework, do some soul searching, always use your brain and don't blindly follow what the doctor says.   Not sure how helpful this has been, again, sorry I'm not the right tumor, but I feel obligated to share my proton experiences because I consider it an excellent option.  I wish you luck, and hope you find some answers :)"

cancer,361sfi,Carl58,1 point,Sun May 17 23:44:16 2015 UTC,"Typical outlook for ""nonsmoker"" nsclc variants like egfr are better than for other types. If she is egfr+ then she can take tarceva which is an inhibitor or so-called ""smart drug""/ targeted chemo. Plus new inhibitors are on their way, as well as immunotherapies like opdivo and keytruda. However, responses vary significantly.   The cancer won't go away, but hopefully she can reach a stage where the cancer is not visible in ct scans for a period of time. Normal response for inhibitors are up to a year but with significant variation for the individual patient. To be blunt very few patients with stage four ncslc reach the five year mark, but it happens on very rare occasions and some have passed the ten year mark like Linnea Duff and others (although they rarely have mets to the bone when they ""start"")...   I am stage four in remission a little over a year into my diagnosis and I play tennis, floorball, row, run, swim etc. You would never guess I was ""terminal"" just seeing me.  I suggest you make the most of whatever time you have left with your mother. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst..."

The one thing you should always know is that your dad loved you unconditionally, the last thing he'd want is for you to burden yourself with so much regret. My dad use to have to remind me that hindsight is 20/20, which makes us lament our actions/choices/decisions.    15 is a tough age just to be a ""normal"" teen, I have no doubt that your dad understood that you were having a hard time dealing with it all. It's ok to have moments where you feel ""crap! I really wish I had insert random thing here""  just don't dwell on the woulda/coulda/shoulda crap; because the one thing all parents want for their kids is to enjoy life and live it to the best of our abilities.   As time goes on it becomes a bit easier to let go of the emotional baggage we can carry around afterwards. I won't tell you time heals all... Because trust me at here are days where I would give ANYTHING to have him here... This year marked 10 years since he passed... The one thing that hurts the most and I don't think it'll ever change, but the fact that he won't be there to walk me down the aisle when I get married...and that my fiancé never got to meet him.

He asked her ""You would do anything for your momma right?"", ""yes"" she said, ""So do what she would have wanted you to do most for her which is try to be happy and live a good life"".  There's always going to be moments in our lives when we go crazy thinking back and wanting to change things and regrets and all that but there's nothing we can do.

What I think is important is that you (both you-yourself and your siblings) spend time with her, and also try to be there for each other. You don't know how much time you have together with her.  It's hard, and I don't think there is a recipe for getting through that applies to everyone.  I can tell you that it did bring me and my brother closer together though. All you can do is lean on each other as a family, and you'll get through it. I wish you all the best, and stay strong! And cry as often as you feel like it. Internet hugs!"

I'm so used to being able to solve problems that it's second nature to me. I see an issue, I figure out what the root problem is, I set out to fix that issue and move on.  In this instance there isn't anything for us to fix.   They need our support. What you and I feel? They feel it times a thousand. For them it's survival instinct - like a cornered animal. Pure fear and rage (hopefully). Primal instincts.   They need us to pull them up. The rest of our family needs us to pull them up. Grit your teeth and be strong for them... They'll feed off of it and be strong, too. What will happen will happen, you can be sad when it's all said and done."

How are you holding up with all of this? Do you have a good support system around you?  Are you scheduled for your orchiectomy yet? I'm not sure where you are in your learning about all of this, but in your situation (where you will need surgery and chemo or radiation depending on whether its a seminoma or nonseminoma) you really should consider going to Dr. Einhorn and his team at Indiana University or Dr. Sheinfeld at Memorial Sloan Kettering for at least the surgical part of this. The operations needed (like the RPLND) are not frequently performed and shouldn't just be done by any urologist.   There are some really awesome resources for info out there, including the TC forum: http://www.tc-cancer.com/forum/  Also, treatment guidelines that all docs should be following can be found on NCCN: http://www.nccn.org/patients/guidelines/cancers.aspx  You just have to register to access the PDF (its free).  If you have any questions or want to talk about this stuff, please feel free to PM me any time. Always here to help, hang in there!  Edit: Also, if you haven't already, consider banking sperm asap. I don't know if you have kids yet or not, but things will move fast with treatment and its something that would be helpful for you to look into sooner rather than later."

Given the lung lesions and degree of tumor marker elevation, it sounds like a stage IIIB if beta-HCG is between 5000 and 50,000 in which case the standard of care would be four cycles of BEP.

My mother is bipolar, and runs on the narcissistic side of things. Thankfully she has been busy at work, so there hasn't been opportunity for her to really sink her teeth in. Having anxiety myself, I know its not her fault. I get angry and stuff she says. I am bad at bottling things up, because I don't want to deal with what happens after. Dont get me wrong, I love her she was the one to take us in, and I am grateful. We just but heads, or she will say something and not realize that it is rude or mean.   I need to go back to therapy.   My oncologist is amazing. So is my normal doc. I had my yearly with my normal doc to talk about my anxiety, and my arthritis. She brought up therapy. I admit, I tried to go to the group the cancer center offers. I could not walk in. I have a hard time meeting new people, and groups are scary.   I need to go back to therapy.

It can be easier to vent in this place with so much anonymity but I would urge you if you are struggling to seek out some private therapy and then maybe after you settle in bring your husband. Just having him sit in on a session or two will do wonders for keeping that line of communication open in your relationship because you're getting professional help and he is still privy to your struggle without being locked out - so to speak.

cancer,35wq3o,pointywalrus,1 point,Thu May 14 04:36:37 2015 UTC,Welcome! Fatigue is common in getting ready for that transplant because you are immunosuppressed and it will continue for some time...but it will get better! You are taking all the right steps and you seem ready for what is to come.
cancer,35wq3o,Clvrendvour,1 point,Thu May 14 11:04:40 2015 UTC,Autologous or Allogeneic HSCT? Are the source of cells peripheral blood or bone marrow? I had an allo BMT in February of last year after being diagnosed in Sep 2013 (it took a little while to find a donor after the first donor backed out). I'm just a little surprised at the timing since you literally just finished induction - won't they also do consolidation before the SCT?
cancer,35wq3o,Josh3781,1 point,Thu May 14 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"I'm doing an allo. I was unlucky in the donor match game.

cancer,35wq3o,Mr_Fasion,1 point,Fri May 15 04:42:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's rough. I'm sorry that you weren't able to find a donor. Once my initial donor backed out, my team didn't think that I'd find another match. My donor had actually just joined the registry during the second search, and the coincidence could not have been more astonishing for me.    Was there any reason they chose not to do cord blood (or was there no match in cords either)? Is the conditioning regimen you're doing a reduced intensity? My regimen was 12 grays of Total Body Irradiation followed by 2 days high-dose etoposide. Are you already in the hospital for conditioning? Are you nervous about the transplant? If you'd like any advice or have any questions, feel free to PM. I found that the transplant binder was only so good; there was a lot I wished I'd been able to talk to someone about."

I was diagnosed with cancer last June, and at the time I said I didn't need to see anyone. However, 11 months later I was ready to see a professional and it helped a great deal.  patients aren't the only ones who benefit from talking to a counselor, caregivers need support, too.  If you're not able to/not interested, perhaps you can focus on a hobby or start doing bucket list things to relieve stress and bring you some joy?

As far as method for taking it, we purchased a small vaporizer (the Magic Flight), so that it wouldn't be harmful for the lungs. We also tried various edibles."
cancer,35uish,shibbyshaw,1 point,Thu May 14 00:30:37 2015 UTC,"It helps. I had a heart transplant prior to chemo so everything smoke related was off limits. I didn't do any of that fancy stuff like oils, but man just that third day after the infusion was awful, and smoking was such a huge help. Helped me laugh at the stupid shit on TV, helped with my appetite, nausea, reduces overthinking/stress. I highly advise looking into it."
cancer,35uish,disposethis,1 point,Thu May 14 04:14:51 2015 UTC,"I am thankful that medical marijuana is now legal in my state, with dispensaries on their way. My oncologist, a lovely 80 year old leprechaun, told me that he wasn't going to tell me to do anything illegal but that if I had been thinking about it, he'd recommend a vaporizer. It was what enabled me to work full time through treatment - the handfuls of pain, anxiety, nausea, and sleep meds made me a complete zombie.   Unfortunately, it also probably contributed to my massive weight gain during treatment and afterwards (damn you, steroids), but I suppose weight gain is better than eating nothing as I did before I decided to try marijuana."

I haven't lost anyone close to me from cancer - well, my BIL, but we were not that close and didn't see much of each other due to distance. Your dad will not have held it against you that you didn't have one last meaningful conversation, like they do in the movies. He will have known that you loved him and were there with him right til the end. That's worth more than anything else."
cancer,35sjb2,UR_Face,2,Wed May 13 07:31:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for your kind words. I'm not sure why I had that scenario pictured in my head - probably because of movies and any other source I've read/watched. I feel very naive now but that's just all I've been exposed to and I guess it made me feel better to keep that ending in mind.. we had a good relationship and I moved back home a few years ago to be with him so I don't regret anything.

The suddenness and unpredictability of death is probably the worst part about life. When my grandmother was dying of an aortic dissection, I found out just before having to leave for an oncology appointment. I remember waking up grumpy and snappishly telling my parents we needed to leave, only to have my mother reply ""Grandma's dying."" She had had an aortic dissection around 530AM upon rising for the day, hadn't regained consciousness, and would not regain consciousness. I had to say goodbye over the phone several hundred miles away while I was en route to the appointment. My grandfather told me that her face moved slightly when I spoke and I'm glad I was given that comfort. I still have a half-written letter addressed do ""Grandma and Grandpa"" that I'll never send. The last words I ever spoke to her were when we visited in the summer, and I had to apologize because I wasn't feeling good and wanted to get home... I was in the nearby hospital for cholecystitis an hour later (never made the drive home; 8 hour ambulance ride to get me back to my home hospital)... but I feel like I was robbed of my last meaningful interaction with my grandmother because of that. I hate that. And I was in the hospital with an infection during her funeral - again because of the cancer weakening my immune system - so I never got to say goodbye to her in person.  I don't know if I really have a point to this, but I just wanted you to know that you're not alone. What you're going through is much more difficult than what happened to me, and I'm very sorry for your loss."

I think sometimes when you're dealing with this you feel very alone, even surrounded by others. Other people don't understand.. unless you've dealt with it in your life it's just unfathomable. I've had people calling all day and I have been doing more comforting than receiving.   There was a thread on AskReddit a bit ago about what fucks a person up that you may not think about and I was so relieved that the first comment was taking care of someone who was dying. It is so comforting to know that other people have struggled through something similar and have had the same thoughts."

I only ever got a fever once, a few days after my last treatment. I was a little more careless, because hey i am done. But that wasnt the case. Damn fever.   If you do go out be careful. I would go grocery shoppi g on days i felt good. If my counts were up no mouth cover, if they were low, I would cover. Hand sanitizer in pocket/purse, along with a travel container of disinfectant wipes."

cancer,35u8gw,Josh3781,2,Fri May 15 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"Ironically enough, low ANC doesn't correlate well with febrile neutropenia for patients with classical HL receiving ABVD.  While the quality of the literature isn't great, it's what we have.  Vakkalanka B, Link BK. Adv Hematol. 2011;2011:656013.  Having said that, 0.2 is definitely on the low side, and most of my colleagues would use a couple of days of G-CSF.  There is a theoretical danger of potentiating bleomycin toxicity, but the risk is probably just that (theoretical).  The reality is that the risk of febrile neutropenia is very low with ABVD chemotherapy and doesn't correlate well with the neutrophil count on D1 / D15.  I have a patient who has been at 0.4 on chemotherapy days, and I haven't been giving growth factors.  Best of luck."
cancer,35u8gw,disposethis,1 point,Fri May 15 23:54:39 2015 UTC,"I don't...huh? Haha. I'm hoping to find out my counts are up on the 22nd. I've had 5 days of granix to boost the neutrophils   Edit: also, they went ahead and administered the chemo on the 8th as well even when it was .2"
cancer,35u8gw,disposethis,3,Sat May 16 01:25:02 2015 UTC,"They did the right thing.  Never hold ABVD or dose reduce for low counts if there have not been prior episodes of neutropenic fever.  Not all oncologists are trained correctly on this point, but there is not really any controversy there.  This is not the case with all regimens, but we always give ABVD on time if at all possible.  There is, however, no consensus on growth factors.  It was definitely reasonable to give granix.  It would have been defensible to not give it as well."
cancer,35u8gw,pointywalrus,1 point,Sat May 16 05:00:13 2015 UTC,"With leukemia, it took a ton of time for my WBC to come back up after treatment. My counts still aren't ""normal"" - my lymphocytes are still under 1,000 cells/ul (lower limit of normal is 1,450) - so I'm still kind of in the habit of being overly cautious. Your nurse gave you the same advice that I was given, and it served me well. I truly believe I had fewer hospitalizations from infection by following those simple rules. People will look at you like you're a leper, and avoid you when you're wearing a mask, but hey, that's just what you want them to do. I didn't wear a mask when my ANC was above 1, but I still followed the other rules like avoiding crowds and avoiding obviously sick people. To this day I go grocery shopping around 9-10 PM, and I find it much more peaceful and less stressful than shopping in the daytime. It really does take a long time for the immune system to fully recover after chemo. I feel like even when counts first normalize after chemo your immune function still isn't quite up to snuff compared to they way it had been before cancer.    I also totally brought my own silverware to cafes and I never ate anything with my bare hands while I was out, because I couldn't be sure that my hands were totally clean. People definitely gave me some looks, but I tried to play it off like I was being environmentally conscious (I trusted silverware at restaurants for the most part). Haha, I remember one time I was dressed nicely wearing a sport coat and I had my silverware wrapped in a napkin and placed in the inside breast pocket and I remember loving the looks people gave me when I pulled out my silverware to eat my sandwich at a cafe. Oh my goodness. Looking back on it now, I don't know if that was just insanity or if I was actually protecting myself, but it made me feel better to know that my utensils had been cleaned by my own hand and hadn't come from a common bin (like the bins that hold plastic silverware that cafes leave out), and I think that the peace of mind made it worth it.    So yeah, while you're neutropenic, be incredibly careful even if you may feel silly. Another thing is to be very careful with your food while you're neutropenic - good hygiene, careful preparation, safe food temperatures e.g. no rare steaks :(, reheating leftovers to a safe temperature, etc. Be careful with what you order at restaurants, too. I should know the importance of food safety because I ended up hospitalized during a bout of food poisoning. With a suppressed immune system, everything hits you a lot harder than you'll expect because you'll be thinking about what used to happen when you got sick before cancer. But oh it's so much worse when counts are low. When in doubt, throw it out. And follow the rules your nurse suggested while you're neutropenic. Best of luck to you!"
cancer,35u8gw,tarlack,1 point,Wed May 13 16:08:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I've already tried to be careful about washing my hands often, not touching stuff, avoiding sick people, and not eating raw/undercooked food.   I wore a mask into the hospital yesterday when I went to get my granix shot. A lady leaving looked at me and said ""I wear mine everywhere"" which made me feel better.   They don't look at you too funny in hospitals, but I imagine people in grocery stores will think I'm sick and avoid me. Sounds good to me! KEEP AWAY PEOPLE.   Your advice is great and it's amazing to think about so many little things that my strong immune system just handled before.   I want to be able to go do some things every once in awhile because otherwise I'll go crazy over the next several months. I've already started feeling a lot of sadness and anger thinking about things I can't do this summer. I think I'll go see The Avengers in a few weeks when it dies down. I'll go on an off day and not get popcorn."
cancer,35u8gw,Josh3781,1 point,Wed May 13 16:25:30 2015 UTC,"I am going to say I was lucky, I always just did what I wanted when ever I wanted to.  I took flights, eat food on the forbidden list, and did to much stuff public. If I had a sniffle I would put a mask on to protect other people on the BMT floor.  The one thing that saved me is I refused to touch my face and I was diligent in washing my hands or putting on gloves.  I also avoided sick people most of the time, so that meant not visiting some people.  I remember not seeing my girlfriend for two weeks because she was sick.  I used the idea that sick people are going to get me sick no matter what stage I was at, but I did try to avoid unnecessary risk.   Do what makes you feel comfortable and safe.  Always think about you hands and avoid touching stuff."

This part of the treatment is where the body starts wearing down and getting tired - he's gone through this for a couple of months and maybe can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Perhaps some distractions - DVDs to watch on a portable player / laptop (movies, binge watch some TV shows), some new books (maybe something lighter depending on his ability to concentrate), a journal if he wants to write, a mini whiteboard w/ markers if he wants to draw, think about some new food to try, maybe get some friends to come over (they may have felt weird about visiting but would with some encouragement).  There will be a break after the chemo and before surgery - maybe 3 to 4 weeks to allow the body to recover and get ready for the next step.  This time can be a great interlude and something to look forward to - he's probably off the neutropenic diet, friends can come over, can go out (all depending on Dr.'s orders, of course).  My 16 yo son also has Ewing's and had his surgery last week, so we're probably about 6-8 weeks ahead of you.  Feel free to message me."

A more practical action is to call a social worker, and get them involved. It's not ideal, but they can advocate for treatment. Call social services.   EDIT. I should be specific, call a charitable hospital and ask to speak with a patient navigator or social services. Not social service of your local government/municipality."
cancer,35ruow,RealDurv,1 point,Wed May 13 00:39:20 2015 UTC,"She has the ability to say no, but you have to give her a reason to go.

Ask her very indirectly what is stoping her, and see what road that takes you down."
cancer,35ruow,tarlack,1 point,Wed May 13 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"I think you should get someone from the hospital where she is supposed to have her appointments--maybe someone who is part of the hospital's support group, who is a survivor--to come by the house, multiple people, people who are actually going through what she's going through to be able to help her and let her know there's still hope. You may have to do this several times, but that may be necessary to let your mom really know and believe that she can get through this and that there are people out there who are willing to help her get through it. If the supporter/cancer survivor can't come to the house, then phone calls could also be an option.  My mom has had stage 2 breast cancer twice, and has gone through 2 bouts of chemo and radiation. She's come out okay. It's definitely hard, but there are some upsides to the many downsides. It definitely brings you and the family closer together; and it also hopefully will show her, by the end of it, just how strong she really is. She has incredible fight locked up within her that she isn't even aware of. I guarantee that she will impress herself with how strong she is at the end of her treatment.  My mom was hopeless too. But after the darkest of nights comes the brightest of mornings. Just tell her that's what she can hold on to. It's valid, it's true, and it's so real."

I just want to give advice and my opinion.   Darling, by the looks of it she doesn't want to go on. Personally, I think you have to accept that. She is a grown woman and can make rational decisions for herself. If she is shutting everyone down when they tell her it's probably because she's come to term that her life on this earth has come to an end and you should respect and support her.   Chemo is very harsh. It breaks people down. Perhaps she'd rather live out her days as best she can and the way she choses to rather than be seen broken and weak.  I'm going through it with my boyfriend right now, but it is because he chose to fight. Right now he's questioning his will tp go on. And I am learning to accept that. That if it's his choice to go then I can't stop him.   We can't be selfish, love. Of course you want to see your mother live and go on. Of course I want to someday marry and build a life with my boyfriend. But sometimes life has a different plan for us.   My father was a drug addict. He left his wife with 5 children on her own. Trust me when I say that you can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves.   We must learn to accept defeat sometimes. We have to learn to let go.   Be content with the fact that she's lived her life and she's left her mark on this world through her child(ren).  Support her, in whatever she chooses.   Good luck darling.  xoxo"

I've been involved in the care of a couple of patients who had leptomeningeal involvement, and it can be devastating to both the patient and the family.  My question is, what are your brother's goals?  I'm wondering if the family's goals are in line with your brother's.  I'm certain it may seem difficult to say goodbye to someone who means so much to you, but it would be doing your brother a disservice to go above and beyond the level of care he desires."
cancer,35s1x6,The_Gage,2,Wed May 13 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"While I can understand the will to fight on, both directly and indirectly, it's important to be realistic as well.  One has to consider both quantity and quality of life, and one of the hardest things to decide in treatment is when ""enough is enough.""  Especially when choosing to forego additional care is seen as ""giving up"" in a world where we talk about survivors, fighting, and so on.  I guess what I'm trying to say is:  Leptomeningeal cancer is not, at least in the medical world, seen as a curable disease.  And in someone who may have only a few months left, it would be a terrible thing to use that time to try to find an unattainable cure.  Just something to think about.  Again, I'm very sorry your family is going through this.  Best of luck."
cancer,35s1x6,The_Gage,1 point,Wed May 13 05:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to realize that leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is a form of spread; it means that the cancer has begun coating the meninges throughout the central nervous system, spreading through the cerebral spinal fluid.  It is a form of metastasis.  Even treated, median survival is two to three months.  In extreme cases, some patients can get up to eight months.  But those are select patients.  Maybe your brother falls into that category."

I hope you have someone you can talk to verbally, you need as much support as possible to help you to be as strong as possible for your wife and family, the last thing you all need is for your own health to suffer.  I must admit, I'd be the same as your wife.    As things stand at the moment, I'm in the early stages and no idea what's ahead but not being able to do the mundane things has been soul destroying and I hate the thought of anyone coming round to do the dusting or anything at all.  And we only have a dog to think about.  Please be careful you don't get overwhelmed too much, please have an outlet somehow, someway.  I have come to Reddit tonight but I am lucky to have a best friend that I can tell anything and I like to think my fiance has a few people he can confide in regardless of how depressing the situation has been or may become.  But yes there will always be those that really don't seem to be able to cope with the enormity of what's going on.  Just before I was diagnosed, one of my best friends, only 36 years who had just had a baby was told within a matter of weeks after the birth that she had breast cancer and then quickly told it was incurable.  They have a 2 year old too and she spends most of her time in bed and then putting on her make-up every now and again to ""face the world"".

My time, attention and love.  I'm just too tired to give it lately.  For example, last night, she wanted to talk about whether or not she should get more treatment, or just turn to palliative care.  Of course, she started the conversation when we were alone in the bedroom at about 10pm.  This is a serious and not short conversation.  I could barely keep my eyes open.  It was all I could do to muster enough concentration to speak.  We talked for a long time, but I don't feel like I did it justice.  She seemed fine with the conversation, and I don't know if she noticed.  I did.  But I'm thinking... What the hell am I doing?  I got people fed, cleaned up the kitchen, drove kids where they needed to be, coordinated car pools to dance classes and band concerts with other parents, picked up prescriptions, went to work, etc...  But I didn't have enough energy at the end of the day to have this important conversation with my sick wife?  What am I spending my time on?"

I know people think I am having a easy recovery, but the truth is it sucks. You can not tell that to everyone, or update people that you can barely walk because of  neuropathy. I could go one, but I understand how hard it is and I am winning my fight. I can not even imagine what it will be like if this one day kills me.

Even though we all share different experiences, I have a good understanding of your situation as I too am a caregiver for my boyfriend.   You're right, no one knows. On the darkest nights we see what no one else sees. Other people only see so much. And at the end of the day no one wants to hear the truth because saying it out loud makes it real to them. But it is real. All of it is real and we live it out everyday.  You are so strong for taking this head on. Once she is gone I hope you find some comfort in knowing that she will be resting peacefully. And I am so sorry for your children, more than anyone they don't deserve to lose their mother.  I'd like to share something more personal with you. While my boyfriend is not dying, it's not entirely impossible still and I try to remember that everyday to accept it if it comes. I take comfort in knowing that I've done everything for him, and that I always will (wether he survives or not). And if he goes he knows that I've loved him from beginning to end, that he loved me from beginning to end. That he lived this life finding the love he deserves and he can leave this world with that very special experience.  Please, please, know you're not alone. If you ever need anyone, feel free to message me.   xoxo"

I was sleeping for 18 plus hours a day, hardly remembered anything, and was drugged the whole time.   Then I had a seizure and everything changed, for me. There was 2 weeks where I would not get out of bed, and just wanted it to be over.   Then my daughter, who is 7, asked if I was going to die. I never felt so sad in my life. When that happened, I got a huge reality check. I did not want to die. I could not leave my daughter. I started getting out of bed. The more I moved the less pain I felt. I still have to take pain meds before bed, since I have issues with my back.   It is amazing what can change."

Going through treatment was tough."
cancer,35qs9j,Jackdonagysassistant,3,Tue May 12 19:12:18 2015 UTC,"Since you asked  :) my advice would be to have anything suspicious removed in order to do everything possible to enjoy a long and happy life.  If harvesting and storing eggs before the surgery is not possible (and it may not be, I have no idea) and children are on your ""must have"" list then please consider adopting a child in need.  Life is so precious. I want to LIVE for as long as is possible- walk through forests and sit in sunshine and lie in bed with my husband and smell citrus blossoms and just breathe clean air. If giving up some body parts would enable me to do that for even a little bit longer you can bet your sweet life I would do it in a hot minute."

I was not able to have eggs harvested before treatment started, since my tumor was pressing on my heart.   I am terrified that the treatment has messed up my ovaries. I had hormone problems before all this so conceiving was pretty impossible.   My husband and I have decided that if we can not have children on our own, that we will house foster children instead. I want to do it regardless, but the time frame would be sooner, rather than later.   Cancer is a scary thing. I am not sure what I would do in your position. However, you need to think about what would happen if your cancer-free, get pregnant, and relapse. Is holding on to your uterus and ovary worth potentially not living to see your baby grow?   I am sorry if that offends/upsets you in anyway. BUT it is something that needs to be thought about.   Good luck, I know these decisions are not easy. I am here if you need to talk."

If it lights up, it probably is and should be removed.  If it's small, and can't be biopsy'ed, I think this might give you more information.  My input/advice...  don't take a chance.  If unsure, assume it needs to be removed.  But I may not be in the best mindset to ask."

My father had colon cancer (caught early, and he's still alive 40-odd years later); I haven't shown any hint of a sign of even the tiniest polyp. The guy who did the colonoscopy told me he tells his patients who have a parent who's had colon cancer to come in every five years. Me? He said ""don't bother. Come back in ten"" after each colonoscopy.  Sometimes these things happen. Consider yourself lucky, and go have a beverage-of-choice to celebrate."
cancer,35owah,goodlit,1 point,Tue May 12 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"Did you get screened with the help of a genetic counselor? It's something around 95% of people who can get conclusive testing. If it is conclusively negative you don't need any additional screening. Just screen at 50 and beyond as normal. If it's inconclusive or positive, you MUST screen every 1-2 years no matter your colonoscopy results. 10 years is way too long. A previously curable cancer could kill you over a few years.   I've lost so many relatives to colon cancer, and have worked with a few genetic counsellors. Your doctor's recommendation could kill you."

No. Last time I was 'scoped was ten years ago, and I don't believe such tests were available, and if they were, they were hideously expensive.  I haven't lost any relatives going back some generations who died from it; as far as I know, only one person even got it - my father - and he had it removed and is still living 40-odd years later.  I'm quite willing to trust the doctor, especially since he didn't even find one single solitary polyp last time. I'm due for another one this summer, and if he finds anything I'll consider counseling.  (One should note that as far as I know, my family (sister, parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, going back two or three generations) seems to get minor skin cancers from too much sun. Other than that, plus my father's one incident, plus my thyroid cancer of a type that's apparently damn near universal and very slow-growing, I haven't heard of anyone in the family getting cancer. I doubt genetic counseling will tell me anything I don't know.)"

Please see a genetic counselor to get advice on screening. A general gastroenterology specialist may not be knowledgable enough to effectively advise you!

cancer,35psbj,swallacephd,2,Tue May 12 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"It is worth pointing out a few things about this vaccine. Cimavax is not preventive or prophylactic against lung cancer. It is used in the setting of advanced disease that has not responded to traditional therapy. It is unknown if there is a benefit to use in the early stages.    Also, some people do not produce antibodies against the EGF - they tend to be older (above 60) or otherwise have weaker immune systems. Finally, since this is an indirect method of immune stimulation (not attacking the cancer cells, but instead priming the immune system against proteins produced by the cancer), this vaccine does not actually kill any of the cancer cells. The primed immune system clears the EGF with the goal of decreasing the spread, however, the tumor burden still remains relatively unchanged."

All I can offer you is that this is a very common type of leukemia among children, but therefore well researched and treatment is somewhat ""easier"". I think for boys the chemo is three years. The first six months are the hardest, it's a marathon. I hope everything goes well for your baby!"

cancer,35ntuh,delmarodonnell,3,Tue May 12 02:03:26 2015 UTC,"Any fever over 100.4 is an automatic 24 hour hospital admission with iv antibiotics, and we had a few of those. She really had a lot of fear of medical personnel at first, especially at her age and lack of comprehension of why everyone wanted to poke her with needles. She slept with us most of the time because it reassured her. I'm almost ashamed to admit that we let her have baby bottles for comfort and just got them away from her last year (she's 4 now) but it also helped during times when she refused to eat, we would give Pediasure in the bottle so she never needed a ng tube. I would say the phase of delayed intensification was the most challenging, and I'm still not sure how we all got through it. Blood transfusions and staying at home on germ lock down. I know she missed out on a lot of socialization with other kids for fear of catching a virus, but once we hit the maintenance phase the rules were more relaxed. She now receives speech therapy, as she was just learning language at age of diagnosis and some delays are common."
cancer,35ntuh,Meep87,4,Tue May 12 02:23:37 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry, there's nothing I can really say to make this any easier but a few thoughts came to mind. I was treated on the pediatrics floor at Memorial Sloan Kettering, and generally speaking children who are younger have an easier time with treatment. One additional thing I'd like to mention is that getting to know your nurses on a personal level is one of the best things you can do for your child. When a nurse really knows the family and the child well, they have an easier time spotting trouble and can be better equipped to make sure your child is seen by the right doctor, ASAP. The nurses, more than anyone else are the best escalators in my opinion."

They were amazing at caring for our son and helping us cope with the mystery that it was prior to diagnosis. The best part about returning in-patient to start treatment for ALL is knowing that the same nursing staff will be there for us again. The doctors and nurses have all been amazing. Thank you for your response. We are still reeling and any input from people that have been through this in some way shape or form is comforting.

I don't personally have any experience with people with ALL but I do research on a specific B-ALL cell line. I can tell you that children with ALL tend to have good prognoses. Can you find out which type of B-ALL he has? Most types have a very good survival rate but there are a few aggressive cell lines that may make treatment a little more difficult. I know this is an incredibly difficult time for you guys but above all, remember that this is an overall treatable cancer with about an 80%-90% 10-year remission rate."

cancer,35ntuh,boomdeeyada,1 point,Tue May 12 12:18:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I thought you would know sooner than that.   Thanks for appreciating me being a researcher! Right now I'm a Master's student (will be finishing up by the end of August to start a Clinical Lab Scientist program where I'll be more involved with identification and diagnosis in patients) and I'm doing research on the genetics of cell suicide by treating an aggressive form of B-ALL with chemotherapy and observing the reactions of 3 genes I'm interested in. The idea is if a conclusive result linking these genes to the treatment by chemo can be established, the genes can be used as a target for chemo and perhaps new drugs can be developed to do just that.   The problem, however, is that the process of cell death is just so mind-bogglingly complicated that it's been extremely difficult and so I haven't been able to reach a conclusive result in the cell line I'm using as the properties and behaviors of cell lines within a class of cancers can differ greatly."

I will have to unpack your research when I get home, but I am fascinated!  How does this compare to Cart19/immunotherapy? This idea of ""training"" our immune system to identify cancer cells is compelling. In that way, it sounds a bit similar.  Again, thank you. I know it must be frustrating work at times, but if nothing else we are cheering you on every single day. You guys in the labs are our hope. For the ones who beat it. For us in the trenches. For the ones who lost their babies. You provide hope for all of us."
cancer,35ntuh,disposethis,2,Tue May 12 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"Unpack my research =) I'm glad you're interested in it and that it's gotten you to think.  Cart19 therapy is very, very cool in that the T cells are modified to recognize and kill leukemic cells only as opposed to chemotherapy which kills all dividing cells in the body, hence side effects like hair loss, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue. The research I am doing, however, utilizes commonly used chemo drugs to genetically trigger cell death instead of reprogramming the T cells to specifically recognize and eliminate leukemic cells.   Doing my Master's has been probably the hardest thing I've ever done because it's been so incredibly frustrating and draining physically, mentally, and emotionally but it has definitely been worth it. I specifically wanted to do this research because I personally feel like there is a lot of value in it as all the data (whether you perceive it to be positive or negative) will be used by future researchers to further their research whose research will be used by others, etc to hopefully one day come up with a treatment that will help save lives. That's not to say that research in other areas is less valuable but I could see a clear goal going into this research and helping people, especially within a medical context, is what I truly want to do and is very important to me. Thank you for being appreciative of what we do. You don't know how much a simple thank you really means. Hope your little guy beats this thing and lives a full and happy life."

Any input you can give good or bad would be appreciated. I have my big boy britches on approaching this and I want to know exactly what were stepping in.   We are taking comfort in the fact that he has ALL in that it is treatable. While we've been in and out of the cancer clinic with his SAA diagnosis we have seen and spoke with a few families that are dealing with various forms of cancer. A good number of the ALL kids have some energy and are actively playing in the waiting room. I don't have blinders on,  i know over the course of his treatment his condition will ebb and flow and this will be a hard long road, but its nice knowing that there is a chance that over the years of treatment he will have opportunities to be a kid."
cancer,35ntuh,gingerlovingcat,2,Tue May 12 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"I will do my best to give you any helpful input that I can. Once you do receive the flow cytometry results from the lab, ask the doctor when they'll be ordering cytogenetic testing. Cytogenetic testing will tell you what cell line or what mutations you're dealing with. Once we know what the mutation is (translocations are most common but it could also be a deletion or inversion) and which chromosomes the mutation is affecting, we will know whether your son's cancer may be aggressive or not. This will then give us a good idea of survival/remission rates.  Definitely keep being positive and take one day at a time, just like you're doing.

If you'd like to do some reading (or skimming), here are some articles with studies involving trisomies 4 and 10 which confirm the great prognosis: source 1, source 2, and source 3.  Hope this helps.

Ask lots of questions to the nurses, what are side effects, and what do other people do? This was something I learned after a few month, not everyone is going to tell you, you need to ask.  Make sure you take care of yourselves, seek counselling, and find support groups.  Also my impression is you will face two cycles the worst seems to be after 12 month.

PTSD has a higher instance rate (how much depends on the study and a couple say none at all, but it's hard data to gather) for pediatric cancer families.   If nothing else, make an appointment to go over the red flags for depression, PTSD, and other things that might pop up so that you and your spouse can be watching out for each other.

Completely different situation, but I'll tell you what I know.   port installation   I try to tell everyone I can about this, cause I had trouble with mine. Nothing big, just annoying. Make sure to tell your doctor that you want your port placed far enough away from the incision that you can dress the wound and the port separately. My second port was installed almost directly under the incision, and made using it annoying.  Also, think about which side you want your port in. Mine's in my right chest, and I'm right handed. No real big deal, but I'm a hunter, and my doc doesn't want me shooting certain types of guns because of the impact close to the port. You don't necessarily lose range of motion in the arm on the side of the port, but you can feel it pulling if you stretch too much. I would suggest getting it on your non dominant side if your doc will let you.   First, am I totally crazy to try to start a new job and chemo in the same few weeks? My doctor said I should be fine as long as I don't have a physically demanding job (I don't -- I'm in front of a computer all day) but I'm worried that I'm trying to do too much.

I personally wouldn't try to start a new job and new chemo at the same time. You might be fine and everything work out fine. It also might hit you like a truck and you only want to sleep for a week. It affects everyone slightly differently, so you won't know until you do it once or twice how it's going to hit you. If you do, be sure to let your boss know that you may be calling in sick.    Second, if you did tell people you work with about your cancer, how did you do it and how did they react? Since I'm starting chemo so soon after a new job, and it's going to be pretty obvious that I'm sick, I'm worried that they will find a way to get rid of me or that they will be upset that I didn't tell them before they hired me.   Like you said, they're going to know something's up. Whether they try to get rid of you because of it is out of your control. People are much more accommodating if you're honest with them. Let them know what's up. They'll either work with you or they won't, but your chances are better if you give them time to work around your situation instead of just dropping it on them last minute.   Third, any other tips, products, or resources for getting through chemo? I bought a (fabulously purple) wig, I have a few pre-tied head scarves, and I'm planning an amazing hair cutting party just before I start treatment. What food, books, remedies, products, life hacks, or whatever else helped you through?    Best advice I've gotten thru all of this: Pride is for the young and healthy, and you can't claim to be that anymore.  Don't hide stuff from your doctors. Don't reject assistance. Especially don't feel bad for accepting assistance. All this shit is hard as fuck, and you need all the help you can get. Take it wherever you can get it."

The port installation is not to bad but it will hurt for a few days.  To tell or not to tell is a hard question I always play it by ear, I own the fact I have had cancer and am being treated. I don't tell everyone but if I need to explain why I am moving slow or not feeling good I will inform the person.   Best of luck."
cancer,35msl4,tarlack,1 point,Mon May 11 20:23:24 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Sorry about your diagnosis.   Be upfront with the employer if you get the job. You won't know how chemo will affect you until you go through it. I have lymphoma, so different chemo, but mine made me tired. Like sleeping for 17 hours a day tired. However, I did not deal with nausea.   The port is the best thing ever. I had mine put in after my first round. You will be a little sore for a few days, but it is worth it.   Good luck with everything. Fingers crossed for speedy healing!  *edit I could not work and go through treatment at the same time. I have finished chemo, and should be back to work in a week or two. I could not stand wigs, so I have a ton of scarves. Also, look into Look Good Feel Better. It is a class that the american cancer society does. They give you makeup, and show you how to deal with changes in your skin, how to draw on eyebrows (totally helpful) and how to tie scarves. And it is free. I read and crochet to help pass the time."

Maybe look into getting hold of some Quitting Smoking for Noobs info/provisions and have a sit down with you father.  This obviously depends on the type of relationship you have with your father, but from personal experience when dealing with stubborn family members, I've found the only way I can deal with it is to have a heart-to-heart with them, explain my side, listen to theirs and then leave the ball in their court. At the end of the day, you can't force someone to do something they don't want to. As selfish and pig-headed as it is, if your father wants to smoke and put yours and your mother's health at risk, then that's up to him.  It's pretty much impossible for him to not be aware of all the health risks he's putting himself and others at in this day and age. If appealing to him emotionally does not work and he still refuses to quit, the only thing you can do is remove yourself from the danger - even if that means not visiting your parents. Maybe then he'll understand the gravity of the situation."

You are still there. But a stronger...kinder more compassionate version of you. People stare....out of fear or curiosity.

They learn to be kind and not stare, that everyone is different and that's ok. They learn that their mother kicks ass on levels that others would run from.

Some VERY important things to know.   Make sure he is being seen by a Neuro-oncologist.   If you can, you should look into Duke or MD Anderson.  I don't know much about University of Michigan, but if possible and if U of M isn't,  he should be receiving treatment at a major brain tumor center, or at least gather a second opinion from one.  Those places will often do consults if you send in charts, scans etc if you cannot be there.  Was genetic testing done on the tumor tissue? There are some very important markers that can help direct treatment.   There are different treatments and clinical trials available at different places so it is important to get all your options.  Again, I'm so sorry.  GBM is such an awful disease.  I can direct you to some websites that may be helpful for information if you like."
cancer,35kbit,lovestherain87,3,Mon May 11 04:55:55 2015 UTC,"I believe he is seeing a neuro-oncologist. U of M was the second opinion, but third and fourths can't hurt. Im pretty sure they do have a large brain tumor center, which is why he was transferred over there. I'm not sure on the testing of the tumor. There was one clinical trial offered but it was basically to have him try a lesser dose of the chemo to see if it still worked, which didn't make a ton of sense because there was not a ton of studies done on it yet and it's relatively new.   Thank you for the points to think about! My mom and my uncles girlfriend watched a segment on 60 minutes about the polio being used on the tumors to stop growth or something. I'd love more info if you have it. I'm only 21 so I don't know a lot about everything but anything helps."

cancer,35kky1,greenizz,1 point,Mon May 11 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"Could be keratosis pilaris - a harmless condition wherein the body creates too much keratin protein and results in bumps. Since your body wasn't creating much keratin during chemo, it may be going into overdrive now. The bumps can get red from scrubbing and rubbing (don't scrub too much, it doesn't help). I had this on my arms in my late twenties - not entirely sure why, but it did clear up on its own. Some research suggests vitamin A helps (not without talking to a doctor, though - too much vitamin A is toxic). I tried lots of lotions, more sun, less sun, nothing really helped. It just sorted itself out after a while. Some people swear by coconut oil to soften it; I've become a fan of emulsifying ointment for all my little skin issues. If it is keratosis pilaris, your best bet is to try different moisturisers to see if anything helps, and wait it out."

Surgery was November 2013 (mastectomy). Chemotherapy started December 2013. Finished it 5.5 months later (mid-May), moon-faced and mostly bald. Two months later I had a nice curly buzz cut growing in. When the wind blew my wig off in the car, I left it off and enjoyed the breeze. Today I have great hair, better than ever before.  I only threw up once, right after the surgery, not during chemo. Mostly I drove to and from chemo appointments myself, slept through much of the time there. The doctors and nurses were great, and made sure I had meds to combat any side effects I might experience. I only needed one pill to fight nausea through the whole time. My ride was not easy, by any means, but it wasn't the horrific nightmare I'd been expecting.

The treatment is medieval and we are often left disfigured and disabled.   Full disclosure: this is not my area of expertise but I think you should talk about disability with your doctor and a disability lawyer to find out for sure what your options are. I would also try to find a head and neck cancer support group.   Also, just an shot in the dark: get tested for autoimmune issues. I am not sure if the symptoms you are experiencing are part of your treatment, BUT many of us have AI issues after treatment. If you have anything 1. You can get treated for them 2. You would qualify for disability. For instance, I found out I had Sjögren's syndrome and SCLE. Pain, dry mouth and fatigue are among my issues but I'm managing them with diet and exercise.

It's so important not to ignore the long term quality of life effects of this treatment.  Have you reconnected with your cancer centre? There may be a social worker and/or psychosocial team that could be very helpful with employment.  It sounds like fatigue has been a huge huge component in addition to the direct toxicities from treatment. It's definitely worth talking to your oncology team about strategies to address this directly. Also, is there a local society for the hearing impaired that has resources?  Sorry I don't really have any answers, other than to say that your concerns are very valid, and you're not alone with them. I think they do need personalised expert attention though"

I make the most of it on smoothies and the like and eat what soft foods when I can.  Ask your oncologist or hell even your ENT for some resources on the cancer centers they usually have a pretty decent staff over there to point you in the right directions locally as opposed to us pointing you in directions that may work here but not there, also scour for cancer support groups as well even if you just want to contact them for their contacts.   Even with your research that you've done disability case workers and disability lawyers can find loopholes. Even if you can't afford a lawyer you can call legal aid and see if they can put you in contact with anyone, but that's longterm. Short term you could contact the Catholic Charities around you. Also locally a lot of the towns have funds put away to help residents of the city like you who are having a hard time. A lot of time people believe this is just for the elderly it's not, could also call your local town hall and inquire as well.   If you live in or around South Carolina (I saw you said south eastern USA.) let me know I can put you in touch with some case workers at MUSC possibly or even over at the Hollings Cancer Center in Charleston."

When we first found out I just about lost it for 3 weeks. Even got a diagnosis of clinical depression. It not only took a toll on my wife but about wrecked me. Start looking up hospitals around you. Find one that has a great cancer unit. Research the doctors and what they have done. Then schedule two appointments. Don't just go by what one doctor thinks always get a second opinion. There is a lot of things they can do to make this go away so get someone you trust. Most importantly you have to be unbelievably strong. Not only for your wife but the kids and yourself. If you got hope and you believe she can beat this then she will too. Your not alone by a long shot and feel free to message me.

You commend her for it, yet condemn yourself. Where will you be years from now? What are you going to give the world years from now?   Your potential is boundless. And at your young age (i'm an old man, you're young to me) you have faced cancer twice. You'll get through this second battle.

Unless you bear some responsibility for that loss - and you don't - survivor's guilt is never justified.  Your cousin was not permitted to process the five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance) while her mom was alive, so she is doing so now - and is squarely in the anger phase. What her family did was extremely unhealthy in staying in the denial phase until death actually arrived.  Your cousin's words were hurtful. I doubt they reflect how she will feel in a year or two.

Sounds like your cousin was never given the opportunity to think rationally about her mother's illness and has a lot of hurt and anger bottled up inside. That's really sad for her but doesn't in any way justify her position.  I think getting hung up on what somebody with a problem says to you when drunk is a poor idea in general and an appalling one in your situation.  It would be nice if one day she apologized or even if she didn't and yet you found peace with her, but on the other hand I bet there's plenty of kind and caring people on your life to spend time with.

cancer,35bj9h,culocho,6,Fri May 8 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know that you can let it go. Everyone deals differently, but I've never really let it go. It's part of me, it's who I am. I am a cancer survivor. I live every day with a set of statistics that don't apply to the general population. I live with the knowledge that I am mortal, and can be taken down by something I can't see coming. And I have come to be grateful for this knowledge. I see things others will never see, because I see the world through the lens of cancer. I got to figure out, very early on, what is important, and what's just noise I should ignore. Other people have to wade through decades of drama, but I got to step right over that, because cancer taught me what matters.   My advice is this: don't let it go. You can't go backward, only forward. Who you are, every day of your life, will be coloured by cancer. This is no bad thing, and it won't always be grey. You're finding your feet again, learning who you are under these new circumstances. You are wiser than you were before, you've stared down your own mortality. Ignorance may be bliss, but knowledge is power. You beat cancer. You did it with a newborn. This is amazing - know that you have done something amazing. Remind yourself of this every day. Statistically, we're more likely to get cancer again than a healthy person. And that's a shit thing to have to walk around with. But there's not a damned thing we can do about that; if it's coming for any of us, there is no way to know and no way to stop it. So live the best life you can, every day. Be the person you want to be, do the things you want to do. The old advice is terrible: don't live every day like it's your last. Live every day like it counts.  It will get better. There is life, a good life, on the other side of this. You just need time."

Sometimes I felt lonely despite having so many friends and family around me.  It comes in waves but it's lessened over time. I reduce stress wherever I can, especially negative people. I exercise (so important to my mental health).  And I hear ya on the planning for the future. Sometimes I wonder why I'm contributing to my 401k cause maybe I won't even live to see retirement. But maybe I will.  Eventually I got to the point where I just had to stop worrying about things I can't control because they were stressing me out. So I take it day by day, maybe week by week.

I also think what you are experiencing is something that a lot of cancer patients and survivors struggle with. That being said I encourage you to talk to someone (a therapist or go to some type of survivor support group) if you don't already.   For me some days are easier then others. I'm not sure if this will make it any worse or better but... some days I am so excited about the future with my husband and some days I think how can two cancer patients even consider planning for the future (he has cancer too). Then I remind myself that each day I have with my husband is a gift (even on the days when it doesn't feel like it...) and that I need to make the most out of the time that I have because there are so many others who aren't as fortunate. Some days I listen to myself and can let go and some days I'm like ""Fuck that sappy crappy bullshit, AHHHHHH!!!""

But after the second time I realized that the likelihood of me getting cancer again was so high that somewhere inside I knew I would die of cancer someday and I was ok with that. I just decided one day, oh well, someday I will die of cancer, everyone has to die from something, and until that day I'll just keep doing what I love and I'll not let it float around above me. I think it was a concious decision, I let myself consider the facts and come to a conclusion, then put it behind me and got on with life. Anyways, I don't know if that helps at all, but I just had a super successful surgery a couple months ago, and I have one more chemo before I can go back to working and everything I've been missing. Soo, I don't know if any of this is actually helpful advice, but at least you're alive for one more day and you have a family and a kid and that's amazing!

As a survivor, I can say fuck you cancer to the fullest, and I feel confident that you are right in saying that cancer will be abolished in the near future. I am sorry it has touched your life so much, and I pray that it will vanish.   Sorry for scattered thoughts and messages."

cancer,358ivg,tinywaif,3,Fri May 8 00:12:38 2015 UTC,Ask for marinol - its a marijuana derivative without the THC.  It did make me a bit more hungry and helped my stomach some.  Worth a try!
cancer,358ivg,ecsb,3,Fri May 8 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"Loss of appetite is a common issue with Tarceva as I understand it. You might want to search www.inspire.com for ""TARCEVA DIVA AND DUDES"" as they have a large forum of people discussing Tarceva, side effects such as weight loss, GI issues etc.  Recommendations for gaining weight are normally focused on eating whichever you like and focused on high-caloric food like ice cream, chocolate etc.   My best recommendation is to talk with a qualified nutritional expert and have a program laid out for how to keep or gain weight.  Best of luck."
cancer,358ivg,Livingwithalk,1 point,Fri May 8 10:18:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this! My mom has stage IV lung cancer, currently on Tarceva and has been having problems with appetite. Her palette rejects anything sweet, most things taste like cardboard and she has no desire to eat. Unfortunately, along with her radiation came severe nausea(throwing up maybe 5 times a day), and stomach pains(terrible terrible...the worst torture). We're keeping our hopes out for this to be due to over sensitivity with radiation, although the oncologists doubt her pain and nausea is due to radiation."
cancer,358ivg,Svnyrs-btwn,2,Fri Jun 12 12:20:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you that nothing makes you hungry like cannabis. Since you have lung cancer and smoking / inhaling is probably not an option, I'd go with an edible / oil / tincture. It will also help with nausea. Depending on your location, you may even be able to get this legally. Check with your doc.  If you're worried about muscle wasting and becoming weaker, ask your doctor about oxandrolone. It's a mild anabolic steroid that helps you retain (and regain) much-needed muscle."
cancer,358ivg,JdH-AU,2,Fri May 8 01:59:31 2015 UTC,"Adding to all the marijuana comments, my dad got a marijuana card just so he could get a special spray that had a high CBD content. It really helps to settle his stomach and it makes him hungry."
cancer,358ivg,halfasiann,2,Fri May 8 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"Tinywaif,  First, congratulations on your tumor shrinkage.  May it continue on and never stop!    Have you ever tried ensure products?  They are bland, but good for what you want from them, which is weight.  My father used these quite often.  I'd start with those products at least.  What foods do you tolerate well in general?  Also, for lung cancer, inspire.com has a decent forum to participate in.  A lot of people there who are on tarceva.  So you might be able to resource some ideas around.    And let me just throw one more idea out there.  Look into clinical trials for immunotherapies.  I know two people now who went from stage 4 to NED on these therapies for lung cancer.  It doesn't mean it will work for you, it sadly did not work for my dad, but it's definitely worth the time researching and having setup and ready to go as another option."

I had throat surgery last year so I couldn't eat; I was fed through a tube, using Replete (Nestle's liquid diet thingie). 7 bottles a day, or about 2,000 calories.  I lost 20 pounds in three weeks.   Be damned you sure talk to a good nutritionist first, about which ones are good for you, both in digestibility, and vitamins and minerals, and calorie counts and, especially, taste."

cancer,3585xe,DrLOV,2,Fri May 8 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear that. If it helps, I'm also really paranoid about sores, aches and pains, and pretty much anything out of the ordinary. It is an unfortunate side effect of having been diagnosed with cancer. I also had an aggressive tumor type and was lucky that I caught it early. I know I have to be hyper vigilant in the future, but I also am appreciative of having made it through with minimal treatment and want to live my life. I was freaked out that I wouldn't have much of a life left, but now I do and I want to be happy for the rest of it. It changed how I live, my career path, and even where I want to live. We are moving back to our hometown so that we no longer have to plan trips to visit friends and family. We realized that that was important and that my career needs to come second to the things that I find more important."
cancer,3585xe,bettinafairchild,2,Fri May 8 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"Hi. Are you aware of the ovarian cancer support group at acor.org. I think you'd do well discussing this with the members of the group. Many are going through what you're going through--it's quite common. It's difficult to adjust to no longer being in treatment and figuring out how to negotiate being told you're well, with worrying about what might happen in the future."

You won't regret it and you will have that memory forever.  If it truly isn't possible keep doing what you are doing.  Everyone backs away with cancer and you need people not to forget you.  All the best to you and her."

Unfortunately, flying out again on such short notice will be difficult.  I have my sisters college graduation this weekend (also in a different state) but I am hoping that I might be able to fly out again next weekend. Thanks again for your support."
cancer,35722y,sheratheawesomer,2,Fri May 8 20:31:33 2015 UTC,"I know it's hard to know what to say on these situations, words can't really express how you feel.  My advice would be to tell her that you love her and you are there anytime she needs to talk or vent. Let her lead the rest of the conversation, that will let you know how she is dealing with it and what she's willing to talk about.  As someone who is in this situation the only thing I would suggest avoiding are platitudes about how it will be okay or for her to be a fighter. I know it's instinct to be positive, but that just makes it harder for the person to be open about their frustrations and fears.   You could also ask when a good time to call her is, is she better in mornings or evenings etc. These kind of things make it easier for the person to know they can vent to you or cry with you.  I'm so sorry you have to go through all of this, you sound like a lovely friend."
cancer,35722y,pdmishh,2,Thu May 7 18:33:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your advice, I will keep everything you said in mind and focus on just being there for her, whatever she needs to talk about.  And thank you for your support too."
cancer,35722y,JdH-AU,2,Fri May 8 20:34:16 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. But honestly, I wouldn't even worry about what to say to her- that's not important. I think what's the most important this is acknowledging her death and expressing how much you love her/how much she meant to you as a person. Do not feel pressured with saying the right words- just say what's on your mind and don't be afraid. What are you thinking? I think that's what she would want to know the most, and If you're worried about her not having the energy to talk, well you just talk. Maybe writing her a letter would help too. I do think you should try to visit her if you can. Be strong for her. Wish you the best. Again I'm so sorry you're going through this."
cancer,35722y,ImaCheeseMonkey,2,Thu May 7 19:31:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your support and kind words.  I really appreciate your advice. Acknowledging her impending death will be the hardest thing to talk about. I am planning on calling her in a few hours (my text messages haven't received any responses today or yesterday) in the hopes that she is awake so I can talk to her.  I did get to visit her 3 weeks ago and am so glad that I did go. I am currently trying to figure out if I can go out again next weekend to see her, (my sister's college graduation is this weekend) God willing. Thank you again."

cancer,356dsb,pointywalrus,1 point,Thu May 7 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies.  She is 39 and it was a late diagnosis.  I figured that if there was no change and they are increasing treatment that is not good news.  I am not even sure she knows the stages, etc.  I do know she lost her hair and it started growing back just recently but that is probably due to the decreased chemo treatments?  I will try to figure out a way to get more involved with her, but she may just take it as more of a warning sign as we are not close at all."
cancer,356dsb,Bob002,1 point,Thu May 7 18:45:20 2015 UTC,"OK, I just called her husband behind her back... he promised not to tell her that we spoke... here is what he understands:  She is going to start on a new drug on Monday based on the tet-scan results (sp?)  She was on three drugs -   Avastin Cisplatin Taxll  The drugs did well for the first three months, but the second three months they did not show any improvement.  They are going to start a new round of treatment.  She has to go in for two hours for three days in a row and do this every three weeks.  There are four applications, so 9-10 weeks total.    Then she gets another scan.  Initially the doctor said it was Stage 1, but the cancer was in her lymph nodes from the diagnosis in September.  Her husband fears that it has progressed but neither one want to ask the doctor for more information.    So, it really does not sound good.    Has anyone been involved in a similar situation?"
cancer,356dsb,Jcc123,1 point,Thu May 7 19:13:12 2015 UTC,They NEED to ask for that information.
cancer,356dsb,DrLOV,1 point,Thu May 7 19:25:45 2015 UTC,"As far as what Stage she is in?  He mentioned that she was in Stage 1 on the onset and that the doctor would have told them if it was in a different stage now.  Is this right?    Based on the above, is it fair to say she is now in Stage 2?  I will keep on him to ask for more information, sounds like that the doctor may not have an updated diagnosis at this time as well."
cancer,356dsb,v-porphyria,6,Thu May 7 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"Typical treatment for stage 1-2 is a hysterectomy with or without chemo and radiation. Stage 3 would normally be concurrent chemo and radiation - typically 6-8 rounds of Cisplatin with 25-30 doses of radiation. Carbo/Taxol/Avastin are normally 2nd line treatments employed after the failure of or in addition to one of the above courses. You need more info, as what little you have doesn't match up with what I know."

It's hard (it sometimes hits me all over again), but I think I'm handling it well.  What is eating away at me is the fallout. My stepmom is in selfdestruct mode (drinks daily), and my stepbrother is panicking (they live in a different city). I was thinking about talking to her, but I don't think I can handle it emotionally. I am now thinking of writing her a letter, to lay out all my concerns about her safety/health. I think I can be both more eloquent, and less anxious and emotional.  It's really hard on me because my dad and my stepmom were the ones who had the more normal family, and sort of a role model for me, (my mom+stepdad are dysfunctional), and seeing that implode is hard.  I just felt I needed to vent a bit. I can handle death, however senseless it is (after all, I couldn't cure my dad's cancer), but something like this really gives me a sense of ""I could have done more...""."

Second of all, I'm glad you came to vent. It sounds like you're going through a lot of struggle right now and in need of support. We are all here to be supportive. I can't imagine having to not only deal with the loss, but also essentially losing the loves ones who are still alive. I hope time helps heal their suffering and they learn to cope in healthier ways over time. Feel free to come back and vent any time or PM if you need to chat one on one.

If your mother was truly approaching the end, I assure you there would be a lot more ""to do"" about the whole thing. Secondly, two months isn't that much time in cancer terms, depending on what pathology ends up showing. Third, maybe there's a reason your parents are not telling you this right before your big trip - they may not want to have your trip sullied by the cancer diagnosis. Or they may be waiting until they themselves have a much clearer picture of what's going to happen before passing the information on to you.    I understand that now is a difficult time for you, but please try not to worry so much. If your mom has a strong support system in place I'm sure she'll do just fine while you're in Europe. And finally, you say ""deduced"" which indicates to me that even you don't know if it's cervical cancer. If you're afraid to know, then don't ask. But if it's something that you must know, ask. But you should be ready for reserved answers if information hasn't been fully shared with you thus far. And given all those points I mentioned in the first paragraph, maybe that's what was determined to be the most appropriate course of action right now.    Best of luck to you and your mother, and enjoy Europe!"
cancer,354u43,pointywalrus,1 point,Thu May 7 03:33:07 2015 UTC,"I don't agree fully.. (but I do agree with most of this) it depends entirely on the severity of the situation. If your mom has late stage cancer that has already spread, then yes, you should stay (after having a conversation with your mom about it. It should be a joint decision). But if it's not really that severe- /u/pointwalrus is correct. 2 months isn't going to be that much time in terms of cancer.   But in general.. you have take things one step at a time. Don't stress about what could happen, and deal with the task at hand. If your mom doesn't want to tell you about this stuff- keep in mind that she is a person who may like to have some sort of privacy, even from her child, about certain things. (I know that's a tough thing to hear, but if your mom has a good support system from your dad, etc, this is something that you should respect).   Best of luck."

cancer,352xe8,charolastra00,1 point,Wed May 6 18:16:30 2015 UTC,"The big one: I have an swollen asymmetrical tonsil on my left side of my throat that has been that way for about a month and a half or so. Its a little hard to swallow and it definitely feels like something is in my throat. My bulky mass was on the left side sitting on my heart and my lungs with lymph node clusters around my heart, lungs and some below my diaphragm but to my knowledge nothing above my collar bone.   The little things: I have a rash forming on my stomach that looks like the kind of rash I got when I definitely had cancer when it was undiagnosed. I've had chest pain on both sides but that could just be the scar tissue from my bulky mass. I have been having severe insomnia for the last 2-3 weeks. I was having some groin pain though its not as bad anymore. And I was just diagnosed with Morphea which is a weird autoimmune skin disorder similar to scleroderma.   Reality: All these things I'm sure could be explained away by situation maybe except for the tonsil. I think part of the reason I am becoming so obsessed with relapse is because I am studying to take the California Bar which is what I was doing last year at this time when I was diagnosed. Also I'm sure stress can contribute to some of the symptoms (though not the tonsil).    It's hard to know what to take seriously and what not to and when to advocate for myself. When I was diagnosed I wasn't really showing symptoms except a rash and fatigue (attributed to law school) except for the time I almost fainted when my mass pressed on my heart but was told by a doctor it was allergies and wasn't diagnosed for another 3 months.   I'm finding it difficult to let go of all the small thing knowing what I know now and looking back. Sometime I wonder if I hadn't advocated for myself more if things would have been different."
cancer,352xe8,charolastra00,2,Wed May 6 18:35:46 2015 UTC,"Could you have tonsil stones? I found post Hodgkins that my lymph nodes (including lymph tissue like tonsils) swell up constantly. They also have a MUCH harder time going back to normal size. I've suffered from a tonsil that is larger on one side than the other since shortly after ending treatment. When I get allergies or a cold, it gets hard to swallow and my tonsils actually touch. I also get tonsil stones due to the pitting around and behind my tonsils, which makes things worse.  The rash could be the changing seasons and allergies. Or just stress! And chest pain can also be stress and anxiety, as well as scar tissue that you mention.  In my case, I developed underarm, breast, shoulder, and neck pain on the left side. I had involvement on my left side, including on my collar bone (no lump there) and my underarm (still have scar tissue). I've lost weight (purposefully) and think I am feeling the scar tissue and other remnants of all the cancerous nodes more than I was before, which doesn't help. My symptoms get worse when I think about it or poke around. Like - I didn't feel anything this afternoon until I responded to this post. :)  Call your onc. Be better than me and go get in there. It's probably nothing - and you should be due for follow up scan soon anyway!"

cancer,352xe8,sunrayevening,4,Thu May 7 01:09:50 2015 UTC,"I think your feelings are normal. It is so hard after to cancer to feel safe. I face anxiety daily on it coming back. Sometimes I feel like my entire life is on hold until I hit that 5 year mark. For me, learning others who have cancer had the same anxiety as me helped.  1. Yes, I absolutely was convinced I relapsed. I had an odd pain in my abdomen near my surgery site. My next scan was clear. 2. I talk to my onc about it. However, because of the high recurrence rate of my cancer, I have scans every three months, so I really don't have to push too hard to get it checked. 3. I cope with the fear through yoga and anti-anxiety pills. As for 4 & 5, I'm still hoping to remain NED for awhile!"
cancer,352xe8,sunrayevening,3,Thu May 7 01:06:47 2015 UTC,For some reason it is so comfortable to feel that my anxiety is normal. I think the whole process was way more traumatizing then I ever realized. I thought about starting Yoga but am so self conscious about my body at the moment and the almost 30 pounds that I put on during chemo that I'm not sure I want to be attempting yoga poses let alone be in spandex. I think part of the problem is my surgery sites hurt all the time. P.s. Congratulations on being NED!

It seems like I cannot wait for my dr appointments every 3 months but I understand that I can't continue feeling this way, esp if I feel relatively healthy. I have been experiencing odd symptoms but I take it a day at a time. Sometimes I feel something and I debate whether or not I should call my oncologist right then and there. The other day I felt something wasn't ""right"" and went to visit my GP. He did blood work and I was just severely dehydrated. We are hyper-aware of our bodies and that's normal. It is hard to be rational about it, but I believe these feelings will come and go with time (knock wood). Best of luck my friend!"
cancer,352xe8,pointywalrus,2,Thu May 7 07:31:46 2015 UTC,"Hello Bellasarah  Yes the whole relapse worry can be excruciating to deal with. I was in remission for just over 9 months when I officially found out I relapsed. However a few weeks following my 6 month appointment I started noticing the same symptoms I had during my initial cancer diagnosis (night sweats, chills during the day, and a cough). None were severe enough to warrant an immediate appointment (i.e. my night sweats were not drenching, or as regular as they were pre diagnosis, the chills during the day did not come with fevers like they did pre diagnosis, and my cough was not as severe either). However, I kept track of these symptoms and presented them to my oncologist at my 9 month check up. My blood work was fine but she was still concerned so she ordered a CT scan. My scan came back inconclusive, I had residual scar tissue where my tumor was and they were unsure if it had grown or if it was just they way I was positioned in the machine. So they booked me for a PET scan and it light up as before. Now I'm back in treatment and will be going for a bone marrow transplant soon.    When dealing with the fear of relapse and going through the scans etc I found it really helpful to try to remind myself that my fears are just that, fears. They are thoughts, but not facts. Thinking them will not make them facts. Its okay to be scarred. Its okay to have worries, but know they are not the truth.   Trust in yourself the feelings and symptoms you have, but also know that keeping an eye on them is a perfectly valid way to assess if they are part of a pattern or just a random cold etc. I think a big thing with me was I printed off a little calendar and marked the nights I had sweats and how severe they were, the days I felt the chills and my temperatures at the times. The fact that these symptoms were occurring over a few months with some regularity, and were the exact symptoms I initially presented with was enough to cause concern in my oncologist.   Good luck with your symptoms and I hope that you are still in remission and stay that way forever. Best of luck with everything!!"

Smoothies and ice cream a great, but I would recommend him eating food as long as he can. I'm hoping the your doctor gave you some dietary advice. I got a whole packet with recipes and suggestions, including lots of ""wet food,"" gravies and soups, dressings.   Some really great recs here: http://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/nutrition_tips_for_patients_receiving_head_and_neck_radiation_therapy/  He needs to protect the irradiated skin, I used aquafor and loved it. He needs to keep it covered from the sun, great time to sport a nice wide-brimmed hat.  As much as he can manage, exercise helps increase the efficacy of some chemos, but I found it also helped with the claustrophobia of treatment in ""the mask,"" though he will get tired towards the end of rad.  I don't know if he is getting pills to get him through treatment, but I meditated while doing rad. It helped immensely. I can give you more information on that if you want it.  I hope this helps, would be happy to answer any other questions for you. I wish your dad luck.

cancer,352s3z,psnow85,6,Wed May 6 16:57:53 2015 UTC,"I am not a doctor, but I had testicular cancer a couple years ago.    What you are going through right now is the worst part in my opinion, the not knowing.  I'd recommend reading up on the process.  I found this website to be tremendously helpful:  http://tcrc.acor.org/   In particular, read through the links at the top of the page that outline the treatment process:   The Orchiectomy - Detailed information about what to expect  The Pathology Report - What did they find?  Staging - How far has it spread? How can they tell?  Surveillance - Observation is a legitimate treatment option!  RPLND - The Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection  Radiation Therapy - What they do and how it works  Chemotherapy - Some call it weed killer, others call it a life saver  After Treatment - What to do once they're done treating you...   In particular the orichiectomy (removal of testicle) is the first step to determine which type of cancer it is (pathology).  Once the pathology report comes back, the doctors will know how to proceed.   I'm scared that I haven't caught it early enough or enough time has passed.   The good news is that testicular cancer is one of the most curable cancers.  Even if they didn't catch it early, the chances are very good that they can still fix it.    Is it normal to grow that quickly?    Yes, testicular cancer is very fast spreading cancer.  This is why it responds well to chemo / radiation; they kill cells that divide.  Your body has other cells that divide rapidly (hair, nails, bone marrow, etc).  They have to balance the dose so that your body survives and the cancer dies.  This means a slower growing cancer isn't necessarily a great thing; it changes the treatment from a sprint to a marathon.   Should I relax   Channel your energy into reading the website I provided.  Ask questions.  Don't freak out.  The treatment is unpleasant, but there are far worse cancers to have.  You'll  be fine."
cancer,352s3z,khammack,2,Wed May 6 17:25:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. That period at the very beginning between finding out you have cancer and not knowing how bad it really is, is the worst part.

I would prefer to have the surgery sooner but I'm prepared for one next week so I'll leave it at that. One thing I noticed when I got home which puzzles me is the information sheet about the procedure the hospital gave me. I was under the impression that I was having a Radical Orchiectomy and the incision was around my belt line. The sheet they gave me was for a Orchiectomy and states that there will be one scrotal wound with stitches. Is a different procedure? Since I know the term Radical Orchiectomy is often used when describing a Orchiectomy in general? I was under the impression that the reason why they don't make an incision on the scrotum is due to the risk of the cancer spreading? Slightly confused now. I haven't been told the the tumour is benign, guess they can't stay anything until its out and cut up!"

But didn't feel sick or anything at all afterwards. Felt abit hungover but it was ok.  Worried it will bleed though. Taking it very very slow and easy. Worried about doing a poo if I'm honest since thats when it will more likely bleed. Going to be a weird sleep tonight since I'm going to sleep upright so I minimise any pressure on my wound.  I have very strong tablets to take if I need them but might stick to ones at home since mum says she can't handle very strong pain killers. I'm not in any pain at the moment.

cancer,352zk5,Charper94derp,2,Wed May 6 17:53:19 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed with (I think) Stage II testicular cancer (spread to lymph nodes, ~9x9x9 cm tumor, growing pretty fast, high blood markers) about a month and a half ago, so I'll share my experience to give you an idea.   First of all let me say, try to be patient. Your doctor WILL explain what to expect, and ask TONS of questions, you have the right. Luckily testicular cancer has one of the highest cure rates of any cancer, so if you had to get cancer, congratulations, this is one of the least shitty. Even in my situation the survival rate for 5 years is 90%, not too bad.  If it is cancer, you will have surgery to remove the affected testicle. If the cancer hasn't spread, you may do 1 or 2 rounds of preventative chemo, or none. I think it depends on how your blood markers come back.  If it has spread further, i.e. lymph nodes and beyond, you will most likely do chemo. Some doctors do a surgery before to remove and do a biopsy on the lymph nodes, depending on the growth there. I didn't have this and went straight to chemo due to the size of the mass in my lymph nodes. I'm doing four cycles of chemo, using the drugs Bleomecine, Cisplatine, and Etoplasine (called BEP, I think thats the correct spelling). This is very much the standard course for testicular cancer that has spread beyond your testicles. Overall these chemo drugs sound worse than they are. You can expect your hair to fall out, mild nausea, change in your palate, fatigue, and weakness. There are other side effects but your doctor will go over them.   From what my doctors have told me, the lymph node surgery (if you do it, definitely not guaranteed) many times occurs after chemo if there are residual cells in your lymph nodes, so that they can do a biopsy (doctors can't tell what type of cell it is with CT scans alone). Although the surgery has the typical risks of surgery (i.e. infection, anesthesia, etc) it shouldn't affect you long term. Again the doctor will cover it if you need it, but try not to worry too much.   My biggest message is, RELAX. You probably have a good shot of being healthy within 6 months or so, and now you're on the path that will get you there. I too took my time in going to the doctor, so we both goofed that up. Now we know to pay closer attention, right? Let me know if you have more questions, I'm happy to help you answer as many as I can.  Out of interest, how old are you? Hows your general health? I'm 29, an American living in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I found out about this 6 months or so months after moving here. Luckily I picked up Portuguese pretty fast or this would be a very interesting experience indeed. I don't work, I was looking for work at the time, and you too will probably be taking time off work depending on your job.   Hope this helps.  TL;DR: Try to relax, have a beer because you won't get to drink if you do chemo :)"

Don't want to scare with what to expect with cancer treatments when it could be nothing.    I had a situation where I literally felt a nice sized tumor in my stomach.  Eventually went to a doctor who somehow did not feel what I felt, so I took it as a clean bill of health.  Sure enough, 2 months later and that sucker doubling in size, I was diagnosed with Lymphoma. Long story short, you know your body better than anyone.  If you don't think something is right, see a doctor.  If they tell you your fine, see another doctor.  Hoping for good news on your end, but update us on your situation if you don't get the best of news."

We got the call on Sunday that we needed to all gather and say good as they they didn't expect him to make it much longer. My wife and I made the ~2 hour drive and spent some time with him and the rest of my family before returning home late in the evening.   He made it until Thursday, because he was a stubborn old bastard who probably didn't want to die in front of my grandmother. My fight was Saturday.   Between Tuesday and Wednesday, I had made the decision I wasn't going to make the funeral. I had trained, my opponent had trained, and my grandfather would want me to keep my commitments. Luckily it didn't come to that because he was being cremated and there was a memorial later on.   I relay this story because it's a crap shoot. While I don't entirely know the enormity of writing a dissertation, I know it isn't easy. I would also be concerned about continuing your education afterwards depending on the timing (that whole people who drop out rarely resume thing). Discuss it with your father and see what he thinks and what steps he might like you to take. It might be important to him to know that your education is finished (or working towards) rather than you stopping altogether.

As well, maybe discuss the possibility of bestowing an honorary degree, or some specialized certificate with the deans.   I wish you all the best and will definitely keep yourself and your friend in my thoughts. Please keep me informed about how this shakes out. All the best."
cancer,34zmlw,5yearstime,2,Wed May 6 04:09:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your advice. I realize now that my education has been a privilege I have never had to consider losing or leaving incomplete. It sucks to see that the university is taking a very impersonal approach to this, but I will try to think of compromises that will at least mean something to my friend.  I didn't even think of reaching out to the campus-wide student government or anything. Although a full degree doesn't seem likely, perhaps an honorary degree is something I can convince them to consider."
cancer,34yzhi,tevlen,6,Tue May 5 18:55:55 2015 UTC,"I know that you're reeling right now, but don't imagine your father in the coffin in 14 months. The way you're writing is just so fatalistic. We're all going to die, it's just a matter of when, how fast, and how hard it's going to be. That's been the truth since we were born.    Secondly, be careful with statistics. Your father is a statistic of one, and as Stephen Jay Gould famously wrote when he was diagnosed with cancer, ""the median isn't the message"". It is true that GBM is one of the most aggressive and lethal brain cancers, however, there is some good research happening with GBM in the form of vaccines called DCVax-L which has shown a median survival of 3 years. So do look into trials, and do approach specialists, and do try to keep hope alive for now. And do look after your father's mental health with such a difficult diagnosis. Best of luck to you and your family."

It's hard to imagine your future without him, especially when he's always been a part of your hopes and dreams. I didn't realize how important he was to those plans until I was forced to imagine life without him in it.  BUT. Don't let this knowledge poison the time you have left with him. It's going to be hard, and there are going to be moments when all you want to do is cry sitting there with him. To be there for him as best you know how, to make the most out of those moments, to be as helpful to him as possible- what more can we do?  I am also not speaking with my coworkers / acquaintances about dad... Have been keeping that information close ever since we found out- for about a year now. The worse dad gets, the harder it is to not talk about it. I hope you'll be able to talk freely about it soon... Sharing really does help and seems to take a weight off your shoulders. I've pushed so many friends away- I hope you let them in, let them help support you. You're going to need it.  And.. Pointywalrus is right- there's always hope, always the possibility of treatment as long as your team is ready to go out and look for it."

There were ups & downs throughout the treatment, and it definitely wasn't a cakewalk - but he had a decent amount of quality time with his friends & family. My sympathies nonetheless, and best wishes to you, your pops, & your family."

It's the quality of the time left and how he (and his family) spends it that matters.  And really, this can be said about ANYONE at any state of your life.  It's just that when your expiry date is waved in your face, its pretty jarring."

I am 21 and today we discovered that my Dad has pancreatic cancer after being sick for months. All I have been able to think about is how he won't be able to walk me down the aisle at my wedding or see me start my own music therapy practice. I came on this thread to find comfort and seek answers/coping methods and I found someone feeling the very same way as I am.   Your father sounds a lot like mine in his choice to forgo aggressive treatments, so I feel I can say with confidence that he must be so proud of you and your determination in life. Even though it is heartbreaking, we have to remember not to give up. He would want you to achieve all your goals and live a loving, happy, and fruitful life even without him. It's taking all my might not to lay on the floor and weep but I know Dads like ours have more faith in us than we know.   Stay strong, my friend. Remember that your Dad exists in your very body and soul and can never really be gone."

I had a lot of tightness in my upper chest where the Port was placed for a month or so after while the skin and muscle's adjusted to its being in there. I hated my port with every ounce of passion i had left and having it removed was one of my favorite milestone's after chemo. There is very very minor risk that i remember with the Catheter and it heal's very quickly. When they remove it they just yank it out of the vein and place pressure on the site for a few seconds.  Hope you the best of luck if you have any questions ill do my best to answer them from my experience feel free to PM me.  d"

cancer,34wsqt,DaB0mb0,1 point,Tue May 5 15:18:12 2015 UTC,"""Tightness"" isn't exactly the discomfort I've felt from my port, except for immediately after placement. The catheter rattling around in my vein causes some discomfort, which causes me to restrict my movement in the same way that chest tightness would. I get mysterious pains myself that I just presume are due to the port, the cancer, or the chemo, but talk to at least one of your doctors about it. If they're not available to advise you, they're not doing their job.  And no, there is not significant healing time when the catheter enters your vein.  And no, there's not really a risk of pulling it out. The catheter is very long and runs inside your vein for probably 6-12 inches. It's not going anywhere."

One idea I've often read about here and that really hits home for me as a fantastic idea, is to spend some time writing letters to your children. One for when they get their first love, one for when they become 18, one for when they graduate, one for when they get married, etc. So that they get a chance at celebrating the beautiful moments in life with their dad in their hearts."

BIL passed away from colon cancer, I'm not sure if he did anyhing as structured as letters etc but he did try to continue with outings with the family etc and made sure they built memories and had photos. The photos seem really precious. Do it sooner rather than later... He always thought he had more time, then he became so incapacitated (not from cancer, from a surgical complication) that he became bed-ridden far sooner than anyone expected. Perhaps also video.. You can always change/delete stuff that you manage to improve on. As flor your bucket list, again, sooner rather than later. Definely splash some cash if you can manage it, do some great things just for you (i think that would actually be great for your whole family, knowing you lived life to the max). What sort of thing do you want to do? Travel? Write? Eat/pray/love thing? Tell us a bit more about yourself... And lets hope that 'months' becomes 'years' for you."

The first thing I've done is to organise a Summer Party for the end of the month to thank all friends and family for their support. I also like the idea of a photo shoot which could be made fun and memorable. The letters/videos I like the sound of but not sure if I could cope with that emotionally - having said that I have gone through all our past holiday photos and compiling them into photo books which I will have printed. It would be nice to fit in one overseas trip but the insurance is somewhat prohibitive.  I also intend to get them a kitten each as they have been pestering me for years for some. Despite my impending doom I feel in quite a good place and fully appreciate the value of the smaller details of everday life such as a hug, playing a family game or just having a chat. Once again many thanks - will update you as I develop these ideas."

Something where they would remember you. Give them a memory of you that they won't forget.   Ideas:  photographs cards audio clips (something where they can hear your voice) a short movie about how much they mean to you  While they will certainly enjoy any time with you now, see if you can find time to create a lasting image of you.

Coming from a daughters perspective, tell your girls how much you support them and tell them to never let go of their dreams in life. Also, tell them what you learned in life, all the adventures you took, how you messed up but survived. All I ever wanted was to learn everything about life from my Dad.   Listen to music together and learn all the lyrics. Go see super hero movies and eat too much popcorn. Read with them. Encourage a hobby of theirs that they love. Go fishing. Build a sandcastle. Let them buy new dresses and model them for you. Play on the swings. Have a messy car wash. Draw with chalk. Play whiffle ball or basketball or putt putt golf. These memories stay with a person forever."

cancer,34u15d,annoyedgrunt,2,Mon May 4 15:40:36 2015 UTC,"Join the club! I was diagnosed with an early stage Melanoma about a decade ago. All it took for me was a double round of surgery. Once to cut out the mole and once more after positive diagnosis to cut out some extra safety margin. No chemo, no radiation, no mets, nothing. Just a big scar to tell the story. A mere footnote compared to what some of the folks on here have to go through.  But there is one thing we all share in here: the word 'cancer'. You actually have 'cancer'. Fucking cancer. And no matter how mild the case may have been, we all share the almost inexplicable agony that comes with hearing that word for the first time, as well as the fear and uncertainty that follows a positive diagnosis. I drew the long stick and got off lightly, but I can most certainly empathise with those going through that emotionally difficult process. It's something that will be with me for the rest of my life.  Don't be afraid to share your story here. People are not just here to support each other in tough times; they are also here to seek hope. I know you may get a sense of ""survivor's guilt"" when you read some of the heart breaking stories here, but celebrating your victory is a great way to prove to others that cancer can be beat.  Congratulations! You are about to beat cancer and that is worthy of celebration!"

You've been through a fairly intense experience compared with others your age, though as you say less intense than others with more intensive treatment regimes.  I'm with JdH-AU - just had an early stage melanoma removed with an initial excition then wide local excision. Like he/she says, a mere footnote. But the whole experience (which was a matter of weeks, not months or years) has left me drained, scared and just that little bit less certain about things in life. At the same time, it's left me motivated to make hay while the sun shines, so to speak. It made it clear to me that none of us knows how much time on earth we have. I wish both of you all the best."

Towards the middle of my treatments I flipped out on my oncologist because I could not handle it.  Not being myself, losing my memories, forgetting everything, not being able to form a full and complete sentence. It was awful. I felt like Charlie Gordon from Flowers for Algernon.  He sent me to a therapist, she actually had experienced the fog like me so I would sit there and cry and say things like ""I can't remember my words."" Knowing I wasn't the only one was pretty helpful for the depression. Also, I got loaded up on xanax after that so I would check out on my worst days because I would rather not be present. I would just stare off into space anyway, the benzo's helped me not care and I needed to not care.   I also had a notebook I carried around. If I needed to remember something I'd write it down, I told everyone around me ""I'm not stupid, I just forget everything.""   It goes away when the chemo stops, that's the good news unless there is something actually neurologically wrong with your pop."

That sounds super tough, and similar to what my dad's experiencing - I hope it's been getting better for you.    I think a therapist is a really good idea for my dad, I'll try to push for that as well, though I'm not sure he'd ever agree to see one - he's never really been in favor of therapy.  I think he is depressed, which is completely understandable.  Benzos and a notebook are also great ideas - I'll see if I can push for something like that as well, maybe that'd help him cope better.    How long after chemo stopped did you notice improvements? It's been over a month since his last treatment - he's now on a maintenance schedule of chemo to keep the cancer in check, so that's a chemo treatment every three months instead of every three weeks - unfortunately I don't think the treatments will ever be stopped fully, as his type of cancer doesn't really go into remission fully."

Like, I know for me, I've got a bit of these symptoms sometimes, though not nearly as bad as this. Chemo screws up your brain.   Treasure the good days. Help your mom keep her spirits up. Plan fun activities for everyone to look forward to. And be patient with your dad. I wish there was more I could say, but to me it sounds like an unsurprising though terrible side effect of chemo."

It's tough to stay patient with my dad, as it can be very frustrating for all of us (especially him) - but it's definitely worth it.  He's having a good day today so I'm making sure we do some fun stuff together, and doing my best to keep everyone lighthearted.  On the tougher days, I'm just trying to keep him distracted from the frustration, and focused on the fun things he can do - even if it's just watching silly cartoons.

How to deal with school during treatment, or even if you should be trying to deal with treatment while going to school. Career advice, getting career networking, internship opportunities from some of the older patients who have been in the work force for an extended period of time, etc. Or even just someone to look over your resume for your first job application.

I think it's important that we keep living our lives, but we obviously don't want to abandon our moms.   Some things I would say to consider are:  - your job(s) and the cost of travel and how often do you think you can visit, and how soon could you re-arrnge things for an extended trip if needed.  - what would you do / how would you feel if more treatment was needed (and don't get stuck in that thought mindset, but see what your gut says)   I would say maybe talk to your mom and ask how she feels (if you think she'd be open to that kind of talk).  Maybe throw out the timelines you've mentioned - 6 months or a year and see how she reacts and what she says.    I think that the fact that you're asking questions about moving means you're starting to feel the time and situation warrants it.  There is never going to be a 'good' or 'right' answer, so listen to your quiet inner voice and try to live your life the best you can."

I also have cancer and its grade III as well. As far as I know (anyone correct me if I'm off) surgery is a good method to remove a large portion of a tumour. The problem with most surgeries and especially brain surgery is they can never really get ALL of the cells. Pair that with a dangerous incurable cancer and it's pretty much guaranteed that the cancer will slowly grow back.   I did the same treatment you are about to go on. It held off my cancer for a couple years while I was on treatment, but eventually the cancer started growing again and I required another surgery. Everyone is different and cancer seems to react however the fuck it wants."
cancer,34v3yv,Pieter15,1 point,Mon May 4 22:14:18 2015 UTC,"Hello,  I have a grade II astrocytoma that was found 6 months ago.  Astrocytomas do not have defined borders and they are diffuse.  There are almost always going to be microscopic tumor cells outside of the mass of tumor cells that intermingle with healthy tissue.   My surgeon described it to me this way.  If you poured sand onto a table, there would be a concentrated area of sand (the main tumor mass) but outside the concentrated area of sand, there would be grains of sand spread out.    That is why when they do radiation, they radiate a larger area than the tumor, to try to get all those microscopic cells.  That is also why an astrocytoma is not considered curable, even though many people go years without a recurrence.    I hope that makes sense and best of luck in your treatment!"

I asked my onc about it today and she said remission will be when I've gone 5 years with no new tumors showing up. With something like colon cancer it's easy for them to take out a big ol' chunk of colon around the tumor and call it remission a few months later. With astrocytomas they can't take out much excess mass without causing problems."

I do have neuropathy in my legs so I take Lyrica and Aventyle for that. This is after seeing 5 pain doctors, this has also covered me for my Brocken back and neck.  I value lucidity above pain and it took time to find this mix but it works best, I also found it gives my the most flexibility. After my accident I wanted to be on this pain mix but the doctors said no, I finally told them to go to hell and let me manage my pain with stuff that did not make me a zombie.  They kept telling me the next thing to try is methadone, I said hell no.    I am of the Oxy but still take  Lyrica and Aventyle for my leg and foot pain.  I am 35 days past Chemo for ALL."

It has become very aggressive in the past few months. He's not doing chemo- his treatment is an experimental drug trial which has been slowly shrinking his many many tumors. I'm new to sharing.  Highs: he's been experiencing severe swelling in his abdomen / legs / feet and hasn't been able to keep any food down. He spent a few days in hospital and  got some answers and speculation on what's been causing it. They don't think surgery is necessary yet- his remaining kidney just needed a break. Things are still quite serious and he's not feeling better yet, but I'm thankful that the docs still think there's some hope... And we're especially glad that he can continue with the drug trial.  Lows: This is hard to write. Dad seems to have lost his spark. Even at his worst around Christmas, when we were the most afraid, he smiled and told me it'd be ok. He still seemed like my dad. He pulled through then... But now, it's like he doesn't care. He still tries to eat for my mom, but he hates it. He's sick of everyone except mom. I don't blame him, and I'm not looking for a magic wand to make act like my goofy old dad again-he feels like shit and he can act however he needs to to get through it!- but it's scary to see my mom, who has been so strong through this whole thing, get scared to see him with this mentality."

Your moms treatment center will probably have more information on getting wigs and whatnot so check in with that. Very rarely, but sometimes insurance companies might cover part of the cost of a wig as ""hair prosthesis"". Mine didn't but my oncologist still wrote me a proscription for it at least to try- so maybe ask your oncologist about that.  It took a little bit of time at the beginning to get used to (wearing/washing/styling) but soon enough it became second nature and helped me feel better on days I felt awful. Sometimes washing the wig was annoying when I was going through chemo just because it takes time and energy, so my mom helped with styling it when my arms were too tired to hold the straightener. Hope this helps!"

The depression set in deep.   Worst year of my life by far.  Those were some pretty dark times.  However, I learned a lot of important things:  There is no one like your family!   Now is the time to love them and be happy.  Not later... NOW!     Cut out the things that cause you stress.    Do something you have always wanted to do.  I wanted to go bungee jumping, so I did it.  I also bought a motorcycle because I always wanted one.  They gave me a certain feeling of accomplishment.    Create goals, work to accomplish them.  When I started accomplishing my goals, I felt pretty successful, and this fought off the depression pretty well.  Write down your thoughts.  I wrote down my feelings, thoughts, past stories, and created a book.   Its pretty amazing, and reading the stories from my past help me feel better.  Don't be alone.  I hated being alone.  That was when the depression would get the worse.  I always tried to be with someone.  My family, grandparents, a friend.. Someone.   All in all man, we are here for you!

She told me the way to get through it is to allow yourself to heal..not in the physical sense but in the emotional, spiritual sense. She would ask ""what did you do for your healing today?"", and I would do things that made me feel good. I would go on a walk or have a really good cup of tea, or just watch the sunset. Just things that make you feel whole again and make you feel like your soul is healing. But putting the thought ""I'm healing from this"" into things you enjoy puts a whole new meaning to it. Besides that I had to go on anti depressants for a little while, therapy once to twice a week, and honestly a lot of hard work. You will get through it though....just ask yourself at the end of every day ""what did I do to heal today?""

My body changed against my will, I could no longer process some things like caffeine and alcohol the same way without a thyroid.  My doctor wouldn't listen to me, and said I was just eating too much (then I showed him my food and exercise diary from the past 3 years. He never said it was wrong, or he was sorry).   My hair falls out. I'm tired, I can't physically lose the weight no matter what I try (and I was already active and ate healthy foods), etc.  I later lost a full time job I loved due to downsizing, and I can't find another full time job due to the country I'm in and due to my very basic grasp of the language (but I'm studying).   What I'm trying to get at is that cancer sucks. And depression is easy to get and hard to get over.  I had an amazing support system thanks to my husband's unwavering strength, encouragement, and he helped make sure I never gave up fully.   There were days where I gave up, but in the long term I still had a life to fight for... and so do you.  If you can, try seeing a counselor who can help you deal with the all the major changes that have happened in your life.   Try writing down your feelings (like you did here).   Try finding a group of people who are interested in a hobby you enjoy. Or, if you don't have a hobby, I encourage you to find one!  Something else that helped me was doing volunteer work.

The idea is to get out of the house and do something that keeps your mind and body from decaying into the same old groove.

When I had cancer, the thought that someone actually cared made a big difference for me.    Cancer.org says this which might help you a bit:  ""People with cancer and their families may feel guilty about their emotional responses to the illness. They may feel pressure to keep a “good attitude” at all times, which is unrealistic. This feeling of pressure can come from within themselves, from other people, or both. Sadness, depression, guilt, fear, and anxiety are all normal parts of grieving and learning to cope with major life changes. Trying to ignore these feelings or not talking with others about them can make the person with cancer feel lonely. It can also make the emotional pain worse. And some people feel guilty or blame themselves when they can’t “stay positive,” which only adds to their emotional burden."""

You need to understand that this may be the case with your family as well. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. You are going through a lot and you need to be able to take time for yourself and get through those feelings without feeling guilty so you can help your loved ones. It's definitely tough, but there's no way your husband expects you to be a stoic fortress.

I felt the same as you did when I went through cancer at 23 - I had a full time job and insurance, so why was I complaining? 4 years later, I'm paying more for EVERYTHING because it snowballed, got out of hand, and my credit tanked. The first thing I tell everyone who gets diagnosed - especially as a young adult - is to put shame aside and avail yourself to all financial assistance. Now is not the time to be the financial hero!  Give LLS a call to see if they might be able to either offer help or give you advice about negotiating bills. This is not uncommon whatsoever."

When I was diagnosed, I made some napkin calculations and thought I'd be able to support myself financially for a few months. Like you, I thought that because I had a full time job and insurance, I'd be fine. But there were a lot of things I did not consider, such as needing to move into an apt with an elevator building (SUPER expensive in NYC), and not being able to drive/take the subway, resulting in needing to take cabs to and from work (also super expensive). These two items alone have increased by monthly expenses drastically.   You're right. This is no time to be a financial hero. I really wish I got my finance in order from the start, because things are really starting to snowball for me, as well.   I was unaware of LLS, thinks for that info.

The week I was diagnosed, I moved to an apartment further away from work thinking I could live in the suburbs and use public transit to get out to work. That meant that I had to buy a car because there was no way for me to get to work/appointments. I was surprised at how hard it was to find rides to appointments when many services seem to offer assistance - the car came after I got a 10pm phone call that my American Cancer Center ride cancelled on getting me to an 8am appointment the next morning. Awesome.   I'm glad you were able to get an apartment with an elevator. I was in a 3rd story walkup for both my apartment and work (awesomely ADA compliant university, snort).

I took only one of the many pills prescribed for use as needed with nausea, constipation, diarrhea, etc. I just never needed more meds for those symptoms. I was careful about what I ate (no red sauce or BBQ).  Important issues though...courtesy flushing toilets, extra care when washing sheets & linens, impact on your family of any exposure to your toxins and body fluids...didn't impact me much, but my kids are grown and on their own.

cancer,34melo,Lilleskygge,2,Sun May 3 01:48:21 2015 UTC,"You are in a difficult situation.  The only thing that makes me jump up and down and say ""have the chemo"" is your age; younger women have a higher risk of recurrence than older women.  The tumour is node negative and not grade 3; either of these being positive would mean chemo would be more worthwhile.  It also has the best receptor profile (hormone positive / HER2 negative).  The Oncotype is meant to help your doctors make a decision in precisely your circumstances but with an intermediate result it hasn't been helpful.  I think this is why your doctors are leaving it to to you:   Option A:   Have chemo, reduce recurrence by a small but significant amount, chemo side effects. Option B:  No chemo, avoid side effects, accept higher risk of recurrence.   The downside of option B is that if it does recur then cure is very unlikely.  I sometimes find a risk calculator helpful, although it can be a bit confronting.  You can find one here:  http://www.lifemath.net/cancer/breastcancer/therapy/  You seem to know a lot of details about yor case which is helpful.  Only thing is which chemo you will get."

cancer,34mefy,Leinna,3,Sat May 2 19:24:48 2015 UTC,The shin metastasis is potentially quite serious.  If the shin bone (tibia) breaks then it will take weeks to recover and this doesn't sound lieke your grandfather has heaps of time.  Almost certainly radiotherapy is the way to go. If the metastasis is big and putting the bone at risk then a prophylactic surgery may be best (recover a lot faster than if the bone actually breaks)

It's been pretty bad especially for the past few weeks that I only recently started to think that I should seek assistance for it. I just talked to my GP regarding the issue, and he suggested that I see a sleep specialist (I've had sleep issues for a really long time) and possibly a therapist. So basically I think talking to your GP would be a good idea because he could throw out different options to help you cope with it. Also, it wouldn't hurt to follow up about it with your oncologist too because maybe he could give you insight on whether it's normal or not for patients to have sleep issues after chemo and what other patients have done about it."
cancer,34ki7r,pdmishh,2,Sat May 2 00:56:02 2015 UTC,"I had sleep issues before my cancer diagnosis caused by major depression. My psychiatrist prescribed trazodone, and it helped. Since I've been on chemo I've had increasing issues getting and staying asleep. The trazodone dose was upped from 100mg a night to 150 and this week 200mg by my GP. So far I've two nights of somewhat good sleep (though with very weird dreams) and night where I was awake for good at 3:30. I'm going to give it a week then talk to her again. For whatever reason the docs are reticent to use another sleep med. Perhaps there are bad interactions with the antidepressants or pain meds.   Anyway, mention to both doctors. My overall treatment team like to compartmentalize direct med management: oncology handles chemo and related drugs, interventional pain management handles pain meds, endocrinology manages insulin resistance, and my GP everything else. This works because they're all in the same system with common EMR access. My point being that your oncologist may expect your GP to handle the sleep issues.   Apologies if this makes no sense.

As for the radiotherapy, I don't know if this is literally true but my impression is that they only do one series per brain as a brain and focused radiation do not interact well -- thus, removing as much of the tumor as possible beforehand so that the energy may clean up whatever is left seems like the smart play."
cancer,34kz7q,jefuchs,3,Sat May 2 08:57:08 2015 UTC,"They can do radiation more than once.  Newer radiotherapies are more targeted than before.  It may be true that they can't radiate the same spot twice (and sometimes they can), but they can radiate new growth that pops up elsewhere.  For some patients, that's no help, because their tumor is localized.  For my wife, whose cancer is scattered in multiple spots on both sides of her brain, it means she'll have options in the future (we hope)  My wife is set to begin radiation later this month.  MD Anderson told us that re-radiating the same spot may be possible, depending on how much radiation was used the first time.  They assess it on a case-by-case basis."

It should reveal the nature of the tumor and help doctors target treatments for the tumor.  The misconception with brain tumors is that even if it's ""benign"" it's growing in a relatively small space near very precious tissue, so even benign tumors can be disastrous. The biopsy should allow physicians to classify the tumor and make treatment more effective.   Yes stroke is a scary complication, but it's not much more than she would experience if her tumor continued to grow.  Best of luck!"

If it is a slow growing, malignant tumor, that can be pretty rare and the right treatment is important.  What area of the country do you live in? There are several great places to be seen.  I go to UCSF and it is a 9 hour drive each way for me.    You will also find at a specialized facility, they will have more options than what the ""standard of treatment is"".

Redding does have a large and growing number of people who belong to an organization that believe you can heal ailments via random prayers and visiting cultish healing rooms... some of whom are known M.D.'s in the area... I sure wouldn't put my life in their hands if possible. I'm sure (or hope) most the Doctors aren't into that but what if you get one that is.
cancer,34iqsr,Ima_Bananana,7,Fri May 1 14:29:26 2015 UTC,"To put your question into perspective, a similar type of question would be ""my friend just ate hamburger. Is he going to get fat?"" Do you mean a McDonalds dollar menu crap burger, or some lean high quality hamburger on a salad? How often does he eat the hamburger? Is it cooked right? Very very different scenarios.    Cancer and sarcoma are very broad terms. Even if you knew exactly what type of cancer, this isn't a ""you've got it, you're going to die in 3 months"" kind of thing. All we can tell you is your friend will need treatment and he should listen to what the oncologist says. Beyond that, it could be anything from an easily treatable cancer that should affect his life much to something that will starts a miserable, debilitating decline that ends in an early death after nothing works out.   I know that isn't comforting, but without any other information, nothing anyone here will be able to say. And honestly, you friend may not want to share. If that's the case, you need to have the maturity and selflessness to move on and support and love your friend how they want to be supported and loved.   Good luck, and I hope your friend has a positive outlook."

We've already gone to a handful of doctors appointments and the upcoming week is filled with many more, along with the beginning of her treatment (on my birthday, man, what great timing) - it may be hard to stay strong, and put on a brave face. Hearing 10 different doctors and nurses tell you about chemo, radiation, prognosis, surgery, biopsy, CT scan.. it gets very overwhelming, very quickly.   But you know what? Your dad will appreciate you there through it all so much, and you will feel better knowing you're there for him. It is scary, and sad, but it also really puts your lives into perspective, you know? It made me appreciate my mom so much more and snapped me out of my bratty teenager stage immediately. I won't go a day without talking to her about whatever, and telling her I love her.  You still have time with your dad - don't forget that. Make the absolute most of it. Even with this diagnosis, we do have to remember that anything could happen to anyone at anytime.

I talked with my department chair today a little. He said there's no installed policy. That he thought I could do 1.5 weeks away (unfortunately, I teach 4 days/week instead of two), and that I might not be paid because with their policy, they might need a substitute. I don't think I'd be able to get 2 weeks.   If he had a smartphone, I'd ask him if something happened to message me immediately so I could try to get out there immediately.   I felt awful the other day because usually he's on in the morning and I was joking on his FB with a post asking where he was... then he says (hours later) that he was at the hospital.

They give medications for nausea but I'm liking both peppermint and ginger tea to settle my stomach. Even if the plants didn't have medicinal qualities, a cup of hot tea helps ease anyone's mind a little bit. I have some difficulty sleeping, as my disease is late-stage, and have been enjoying the effects of bedtime (valerian root) teas as well.  Something I don't see anyone using in the infusion/chemo room, but I found myself longing for, is a sleeping mask. If she doesn't have one, they're great for fatigue-induced naps during and outside of treatment. You could include a neck pillow if you're inclined."
cancer,34ewo2,DaB0mb0,3,Thu Apr 30 18:04:21 2015 UTC,All these! I was late stage Lymphoma too and I swore by Three Leaf Ginger tea when I was nauseated. I also fund this Valerian Root and Hop bath soak that is amazing and helps me sleep at night that highly recommend for any cancer patients (my Onc advised me against the Tea but he could have just been paranoid).  Also I found a really great sleeping mask that I took with me all the time to my infusion. It's called Bucky 40 Blinks. We called it the eye bra but it was the most comfortable mask and was so good at blocking out all the light while I was trying to sleep during infusion.

cancer,34ewo2,bellasarah,2,Sun May 3 15:30:49 2015 UTC,I know that it interacts with anti-anxiety meds and some other meds. They gave me ativan before every infusion day so I think there might have been a possibility of interacting with the ativan. The bath soak was great though. I have a lot of trouble sleeping now and am thinking about giving it a shot because it worked so well for me during chemo.

I played music and/or watched videos all the time while at chemo treatments. One thing I wish I'd done... accepted help with housework. Fatigue prevented me from getting much done...and then I was too embarrassed to ask for help. Food wasn't really an issue, people sent some, if I was hungry and able to eat, it was great. I'm sure this list is incomplete...my chemo brain seems to be a permanent side effect. Good luck to you and her family."

I have really bad dry mouth during chemo and those little cups of water don't quite do it for me, especially in the middle of the night when I'm half asleep (I'm talking about inpatient chemo but also sleeping in general). When I was first diagnosed my brother bought me a Camelbak and it ended up being the nicest thing in the world to roll over, grab a sip of water, and roll back over without even opening my eyes. The nice thing about the Camelbak is that you can sip from it even if it's on its side or almost empty without too much maneuvering.  Any water bottle would work, though. Good luck."

One of the big things that might help you in finding out is including the site of the primary in your search. That is to say, there are many squamous cell carcinomas treated with chemotherapy and radiation, including head and neck (several subsites), cervix, anal canal, esophagus, and lung. The side effects would be quite different for these as you could imagine  Glad to hear your mom has good prognosis and is on treatment, and that she has such a supportive helper.

I'm 22 and my mom went through several different kinds of chemo (experimental trials) for pancreatic cancer and it was mostly as you'd expect - nausea and tiredness. My mom went to bed at 8pm most nights.   The only thing that I hadn't seen coming was that on the day of the chemo treatment the patients are often given a pump of some chemical mixture that boosts their mood. So weirdly enough the days where my mom got chemo were the best ones - she'd come home cheery and energetic which had been rare beforehand. It was the days that followed that were tougher. So I would suggest enjoying that first day - something simple at home to enjoy the upbeat feeling as it is a treat when dealing with cancer."

You will want to get into a lab asap as an undergraduate helper then if you do well they might let you do research. In the US, few people who get PhDs in research based biological sciences get masters degrees. The vast majority go directly to a PhD program.

People come and go through the support group thread I run and the rest of the sub because they don't want to dwell on this experience in their lives - it's usually only people who dedicate themselves because they work with cancer or support, or they want to give back that provide any kind of continuity here.

cancer,34alhb,Lilleskygge,2,Thu Apr 30 12:08:17 2015 UTC,My oncologist told me my surveillance routine such as bloods/imaging.  My cancer has an extremely low chance of returning so instead I just see my gyno (had ovarian cancer) while the results keep showing up well.  For the first 2 years post chemo I was getting my surveillance stuff done every 3 months and now i'm on 6 monthly surveillance for 5 years and then it'll become annual.  I get 'scanxiety' around the time of bloods/imaging but I know that anything that they do find will be in its early stages.  Perhaps you could speak to your oncologist and see if you're able to do something similar.
cancer,34alhb,edot87,1 point,Fri May 1 04:47:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I had ovarian too, and so I also see my oncologist every three months with blood work/pelvic exam and ultrasounds. Do you get scans??"

So now we are typing eachother -Want to meet at the senter today? Got my teeth fixed, expensive but worth it. NO cavities! Hurray! She cleaned them up nicly for me, had some staining from the corsodyl mouthwash.  Just wrote in my blog about bullying. And I am getting such wonderful comments. The teetcher that I had during my practice in teachers college (dont know what it is in english), said that they lost a wonderful teacher when I stopped studying. Started to cry while reading. (No worries, I was not going to be an english teacher. More art and craft, music and that sort of thing).  Low: Still fatigue and muscle/joint pain. Some days are better than others.

And it weird looking down and not seeing the 'girls' there anymore. But I am confident in my decision and I can't very well go back now...lol...I do have a question though. For those of you who have had radiation, what were the stats that the doctors gave you in regards to getting cancer in the future? That's what's next for me when I heal up. And I have read some things saying that radiation can cause cancer as well. I want to make the right decision."
cancer,34agye,greenizz,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:01:24 2015 UTC,So the important bit of information I need in order to answer this question is: how old are you?   Then I can help give you stats based on your likelihood of cancer recurrence based on your stage if you don't get radiation vs the chance of you getting a secondary cancer in your lifetime.   If you don't wish to share and you are over 45 the chances are more likely that you will get a recurrence without radiation than cancer again with generally. Hope that helps!

cancer,347v2r,LoveMadeMe,3,Wed May 6 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"Cancer made me feisty. I am a classic introvert - quiet, would rather direct attention to anyone but myself, and happier observing rather than joining. Cancer encouraged me to take a more active role in my life because I had to - I was misdiagnosed for 5 years because I was too polite.   I was always adventurous - living abroad unable to recount some of my more interesting stories to my parents - but also very risk averse. In some ways, I have to be even more risk averse (financially) as a result of cancer, but in other ways I pushed myself beyond what I thought I could do. Rock climbing for a week in upstate New York when I am afraid of heights, going up in a prop plane on a friend's flying lesson when I have a full blown phobia of flying, and facing my discomfort speaking in public to shine a light on young adult cancer survivorship issues. I don't take crap from anyone, and don't get phased nearly as easily. Last summer, I celebrated 3 years in remission in a bomb shelter in Israel. I was calm as could be while many others I was traveling with were in tears. I am less apt to put up with others' drama or bad choices. After you have lost people to death far too young, you don't worry so much about losing friendships or relationships with family who are toxic or not worth your time or effort.   When I'm in a room of other survivors, I look nothing like my old self. I am bubbly, gregarious, and someone who others know - often from my speaking or my blog. I would be unrecognizable to 22 year old me. Now I am working hard to translate that persona into my daily life."

She brushed me off completely even though I was almost a textbook case. I could have been diagnosed at stage I or II rather than stage IV had my doctor taken me seriously. I wouldn't push my doctors any more because I was afraid of being rude or that they would think I didn't trust them (even though I shouldn't have!)."

With a 6% chance i accepted an inevitability that never came full circle, So with no fear of death and the question of reality even being real... I kinda lost my shit for a while. I found my wife when i found myself and 3 kids later Life is precious again, She saved me, they saved me.

Before, I used to love traveling and I wanted to take on the world and had such a drive to pick up and leave and help people. I had aspirations to go to India to teach English, but now I'm terrified to do something like that. I hate that this is what cancer has done to me in that sense. However, now, I view life so so differently. I feel like I can relate to anyone who is suffering, no matter if their suffering has to do with cancer or not (I find this one of the more positive changes). Honestly, it's made me understand humanity and the human condition much much more. So because of that, it's made me understand and value all religions immensely."

If at all possible doctors will go for an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant so you don't have to worry about rejection as you'll be using your own cells. Otherwise, they'll match you up with someone who's stem cells have the best chance to graft with you, most often a family member.  I've never heard of anyone dying from graft failure, if a rejection does occur usually it means you're going to be spending more time in the hospital. When you undertake the transplant they do warn you that you might be in there for months, or you can be lucky like me and be in and out in about 20 days (I had an autologous transplant). While in the ward there was a very sad story of man there for going on about 8 months. The very nature of the transplant means you'll be in an environment designed for you to be in without an immune system.  The current consensus is that isn't a cure for MM, and a complete response to the transplant averages about 4 years of progression free survival. This same article does mention a plateau for those who continued far beyond that point in remission, to where they might have actually been cured. The problem is that Myeloma is usually a disease that afflicts the elderly so long term data is hard to get. While in remission you can't afford to be relaxed as it can come back so fast. I'm tested about every 90 days. It can stay away for 8-10 years or your transplant can put you in remission for only 8 months. The problem with a disease like MM is that while there's no uniform prognosis what IS important to understand is that advances in oncology and Multiple Myeloma are occurring at a rapid pace so even if the disease is not curable, people are living longer than ever with the diagnoses and the disease is nearing the stage of being completely manageable.   Your protein count is the general tell of the disease, and the rate of production can give you a sense of how aggressive it is. Protein count will be the measuring stick between smoldering and actual Stage I. That being said in my case while I had a very high protein count past what any oncologist could be considered smoldering, I did not have any other symptoms at diagnosis, a skeletal array showed no density loss or tumors. If you are having tumors that means you've reached the point to where the protein was at a high enough concentration and moved from the marrow to the bone. Once damage to the bone has occured, then staging wise you could be in the II to III area.  Hope this helps."

I will add that a bone marrow transplant does not cure the disease outright even if it is successful. My father has been battling MM for the last 12 years and had two successful bone marrow transplants but unfortunately, the MM continues to reoccur. He has been on a number of clinical trials over the last 12 years though that has prolonged his life extensively. Just for reference, my father is now 59 years old."

cancer,347gf5,Silver_kitty,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:49:52 2015 UTC,"My friend went to SK and I was there a few times.  There is parking next to the building in a garage, but it does cost like $20 (being the city and all).  How are you planning to get there?  I usually took a taxi from Grand Central-ish and it cost about $15 I think.    The building is very compact (think apartment building), but your doctor may be at a different location.  The area of the hospital that I was in contained patient rooms so may have been a different building even.   Make sure you have the exact address, and maybe talk to the receptionist when you confirm your appointment about any special directions regarding where to park/which entrance to use, etc.    My husband is considering a second opinion there, but he's having a hard time getting in contact with who he needs.  On the contrary, he's had great success on the phone with MD Anderson and we're considering a trip down there, lol.  I don't know if this would be something worthwhile, but perhaps consider contacting Smilow Cancer Center (part of Yale Hopsital).  It's in New Haven, which is about an hour and a half train ride from the city.  My husband is there now and the doctors are very kind and all of the staff is phenomenal.  We're looking other places because my husband has a very rare metastases and he's trying to find trials he would qualify for."
cancer,347gf5,Meep87,3,Tue Apr 28 22:57:57 2015 UTC,"I can say from experience that MD Anderson is fantastic.

I can't say enough good things about MDA. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about it if y'all head there for a second opinion."

I'm in the adult system at MDA so I'll probably stick with that at MSK. However, I noticed that for ""pediatric cancer"" treatment they extend the age as high as 40 for pediatric care! So I suppose I shouldn't take it as a shock if I end up in peds."
cancer,347gf5,DrXia,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:41:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was on the pediatric floor, as a 26 year old. And I have nothing but amazing things to say about the doctors and nurses there. Also, I have to say, the male and female nurses on that floor are some of the most charismatic, charming, and beautiful people I've ever met. ;)  One small piece of advice is to get in touch with one of the many social worker at MSK. They're great at helping you set up accommodations, providing emotional support, getting the most out of your visit at MSK, and hooking you up with whatever you may need.  There's a delicious pizza place nearby the hospital called Pizza Park that makes neutropenic pizzas. Also, there's a 24 hour Au Ban Pain across the street from MSK at Cornell hospital that I frequented."

cancer,346laj,methylationstation,5,Tue Apr 28 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, they'd definitely look different.  I'm not sure what you mean by specific genetic mutations causing histologic differences.  Yes, but it's more complex than one or two genetic mutations causing such differences.  In short, neoplasms invade; they don't stop growing regardless of the framework and cells around them.  Degenerative diseases usually lead to apoptosis, lysing, or simply plaques forming in certain areas."
cancer,346laj,The_Gage,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:47:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Do you think it would be correct to assume that (broadly) the two follow two distinct pathways driven by two completely different types of genes?  I.e. is brain cancer driven by a panel of genetic mutations that are completely distinct from a panel that would drive a degenerative disease, or do you think that there is some overlap?"
cancer,346laj,The_Gage,5,Tue Apr 28 18:56:59 2015 UTC,"Broadly, yes, they are driven by very different disease processes.  In general, malignancy in any part of the body is driven by two different types of genotypes:  Oncogenes and tumor suppressors.  These lead to increased cell growth by either increasing proliferation (oncogenes) or removing the controls that halt growth (tumor suppressors).  Degenerative diseases, while not completely understood, are generally associated with cell death or an overabundance of particular substance.  For example, alzheimers is associated with neurofibrillary tangles and plaques.  Parkinson's is death of dopaminergic cells within the substantia nigra."

I'm 23, and a few months ago I was treated for a rare form of ovarian cancer that doesn't have a proven working chemo regiment and if it recurs, it's terminal. All I can think about it is what if I recur? Just that thought has given me so much suffering, I can't stand it. I know there's nothing anyone can do or say to make the situation any better- but I'll just offer you what I think about when I need to find peace. I'm not sure what your religious beliefs are (and I'm not trying to make you think any particular way) but maybe this can bring some understanding. Buddhists believe that life is just suffering- the second we are born and exist, we are suffering. And since everyone dies, death is what alleviates us from this, and then we are reborn. So to deal with this, Buddhists (or anyone really) try to think in ways that bring inner peace to themselves. Sorry for the ramble, I just kind of know what you're going through and I hope you can find some peace in your head and bring it to life during your recurrence. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me! Wish you well."

cancer,342i2t,ScopeMonkey,3,Mon Apr 27 20:08:55 2015 UTC,Immunotherapy seems like an incredibly promising field for longer term effective treatment of cancer. I have so far only been on inhibitors but hope the new meds like opdivo and keytruda will have an effect once I get that far. I also hope the field progresses fast enough to give me more years with my family even though drug development is a relatively slow endeavor.   Good of you to work in this field. It must be very rewarding though I am sure it is also tough. Know that you are doing a deciding difference to many people. All the best from my end.

I don't know about your specific case, but FYI, the FDA did recently approve nivolumab (one of the drugs in this study) for lung cancer patients. I know that they are also looking at the other drug, Ipilimumab in lung cancer. IMO lung cancer and melanoma will see the fastest development in the immunotherapy arena. Anyway, something to keep in mind and keep an eye on."

Just like we saw some durable responses from high-dose IL-2 back in the early 1980s, but with far less toxicity.  After decades of unrelenting grimness, it looks like we're finally starting to see some real progress in treating metastatic melanoma.  It's an exciting time to be involved in the field."

Shes aged 50 asian and had a chest xray for a persisting cough and sore back pains to find out she had a 8cm tumor in her left lung and specs of tumor on the right lung. apparently no abnomalities around the other organs but an increased sized lymph node on the supaclavacular lymph node...  Sorry its a big question, but im really worried and wish i could get some solid ideas on what im about to expect..."

Do you have a good line of communication between you, your mom, and your mom's physician? While I don't recommend going around your mom, there is no reason that the two of you could not ask your mom's oncologist if an immunotherapy would be appropriate. Don't be too embarrassed to advocate for your mom or ask questions, but also realize that there may be extremely good reasons why an alternative treatment would help her specific cancer more."

I'd never done it before, and it was different now that I had cancer. So it was a little weird seeing all of these highschoolers wearing shirts with pithy slogans on them and talking about The Fault in our Stars. It was also weird being the youngest cancer survivor at the Relay by well over a decade. But doing the walk and talking with other survivors really helped me get out of the isolation and actually talk about my cancer. And then I turned to /r/cancer for continued support and I've been here ever since. So, welcome to our little community!"

I hope to make it to a local support group, I don't mind being the ""youngest"" I feel like an old soul.  Ugh! I fully admit I read The Fault in Our Stars, but I really don't like how it takes something that's a big deal and kinda romanticized it... I'm glad the demographic for survivors where I am is much older... Most teams are run by businesses or a few elementary schools and sometimes the middle & high school.    Right now I'm stuck in the hospital, but I'm hoping to get out by Friday so I can go to the big Relay event in my county... I've gone almost every year...

cancer,33vgjo,TeacherTish,3,Sun Apr 26 17:22:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure of the exact rules at this school/state, but as a private school teacher,  I feel there is more to this story.   In the four years at my school,  I've seen very few students expelled.  All were for significant emotional or behavioral needs that my school couldn't meet.   Public schools may be able to offer more to this girl.  Cancer is terrible on your body physically and emotionally. My school,  for example,  only has a nurse twice a week.   We don't have educational tutors or paras,  excepting volunteers.  We would be unable to meet the needs of this child with our resources,  even though it would break my heart to ask her to leave.  The administration MAY be expelling her because they know this.  Sometimes parents want a private education for their child so badly that they're willing to give up certain things.  We've expelled a child because the child needed more comprehensive special education services than we could offer.  The parent wanted to forgo this help,  but we knew that would be bad for the education of the child.   It would be very difficult for us to catch a student up who was this behind.   Additionally,  state law prevents us from holding back after 4th grade.   I'm sure there are exceptions to this,  but I'm sure if she were in public school,  they would arrange for an in home tutor at no cost to the parent  (two friends in high school had cancer and this was how they stayed caught up).    Perhaps none of these things are true.  I feel horribly for this girl and her family.  However,  like I said before,  I feel there is more to this story and that the change will be beneficial to the girl in the lung run."

Initially my ship tried to keep me by sending me TAD to a local schoolhouse, but after the first round of chemo they couldn't keep me and I was detached to TPU (transient personnel unit) where I simply phone mustered everyday. I did not have to partake in busy work such as tool issue or cleaning barracks, but I had a real chill first class there that (I think) looked the other way for me.   Considering I received full pay, and even picked up E-5 during treatment, I made out like Fucking bandit. Not to mention the tip-top doctor, hospital, and meds that were ALL FREE.   Unfortunately, you won't be getting or allowed to smoke marijuana. It isn't legal federally and remains punishable through the UCMJ.

Of course this is purely anecdotal, and not even the same hospital system (VA vs. DoD) but I don't think it sees wide use, if any, in the military.

Our neighbors, sweet older couple, came over and said if you need ANYTHING let us know. They have taken my daughter to school a few times when no one else was available.

If she or her fiance want to talk about his cancer, they'll make it clear, but they might need you to be a distraction from the pain of this ordeal.   And when offering help, be specific.

I come prepared with my PS Vita, a comic or two and a fully charged iPhone but so far I've only ever felt like zoning out and listening to music/podcasts during treatment. My mum always comes with me for support (and to do coffee/food runs from the local shops - hospital coffee is a bloody insult lol).  I have 4 chemo drugs in the same sequence each time. The 3rd one makes my arm sting but apart from that, I just get a little cold and sleepy -occasionally a little nauseous but not to the point where I can't eat/drink.  I get there early in the morning so I'm normally out of the hospital by 2pm latest. I grab a cab home and then shower and nap/netflix/game depending on how sleepy I am.

How long does it averagely last? I was in the office for about 3 hours for every treatment.  What do you do during it? I would talk to whoever was with me, look at magazines, do word searches, talk to other patients, eat snacks, walk around the office - they have 6 floors and would allow patients to walk around.

I have my computer to watch Netflix, or mess around on the internet. I have crocheted too, but chemo has caused some numbness in my hands (Neuropathy) so I can only do it for so long.  My husband is here with me for most of the time in the hospital. I have had a few other visitors, but due to cold/flu season for most of my treatment there hasn't been much.   Receiving chemo isn't the worst part, as I don't really get nauseous. I do get itchy, but they give me Benedryl. The week after is the worst due to Neupogen shots, which I have to take for 7 days post chemo. The shots up your white blood cell count, but cause a ton of pain.  My daily schedule was/is messed up due to the 5 days in the hospital, then the blood draws twice a week when not in treatment. This made it impossible to work. I lost quite a bit of muscle mass at first, due to not doing much the first two rounds (which were the worst).   I plan on going back to work in July, that way I can get my strength back.

I would recommend that OP ask about antacid medication since most chewables are calcium carbonate and contain a lot of calcium. The recommended max dose is 10 pills in 24 hours for the extra strength. Also, prescribed antacids may be covered by insurance to decrease out of pocket costs. And finally, always best to check about adding things like antacids; the onc may have a preference."

There are a lot of people here who may be able to help with specific issues if you have them so don't be afraid to ask. The side effects can be cumulative with time.

He was a partial responder and it kept him stable for about a year. After that he started a trial for Keytruda. There has been some growth initially of existing tumors but nothing new has appeared. He was hoping for shrinkage and a durable cure, but stable is the next best thing.   Side effects are minimal, mainly just fatigue. He gets treatment every 3 weeks through IV. Since he is the trial he doesn't have to pay for it. That may be the way to go although getting into a trial can be difficult depending on prior treatments and stage of disease."

And most trials don't want candidates with two cancers. Luckily Keytruda is now FDA approved and can be administered without being in a trial, but the red tape around getting it covered sounds quite complicated. We may pursue getting it off-label and finding a way to pay out of pocket. Also because we are strongly considering skipping Yervoy which is a required prerequisite getting insurance to cover Keytruda. But all the latest studies are pointing to Keytruda being a better first line drug than Yervoy so we really want to do that. I have found rare instances of people who have successfully had their insurance cover it as a first line drug even though it isn't following protocol so there is hope in that regard. I wish your dad the best of luck."

cancer,33rwen,paroonshark,2,Sat Apr 25 01:01:59 2015 UTC,"Talk to your doctor.  Some people can smell the ozone made by the radiation passing through the air, and some people getting treatment in and around the nose can get smells as well. It's usually mild and  I've never seen anyone have to stop treatment for it.  Talk to your doctor. Sounds like you're doing some great conservative things to minimize the smell, but it may be there to stay.  I wonder though if there is a way to help with the anticipation and with the nausea centers in the brain with medication."
cancer,33rwen,beamseyeview,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:54:53 2015 UTC,Ask the radiation technician?
cancer,33rwen,goodlit,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:33:33 2015 UTC,"I did six weeks of radiation in ""the mask"" so I am familiar with your treatment. I'm very sensitive to smells too, although my treatment didn't bother me. One thing that helped a lot was meditating during treatment. I think it may help you relax and distance yourself from the smell so it doesn't bother you. I know it sounds unorthodox, but I got the point where I would fall asleep during treatment. If you want more info I would be glad to give it to you."
cancer,33rwen,litchick,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:13:24 2015 UTC,Sounds interesting. Could you give me tips on your meditation technique?
cancer,33rwen,litchick,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:09:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I had an on and off practice for a few years prior to my diagnosis and treatment, and had started again after surgery but before rad and was back in the habit a bit. My onc refused to give me anxiety meds for my treatments, and about the 3rd treatment or so I realized that if I held my hands like I did when I was meditating (my thumbs and middle fingers together) and just did my routine, I could meditate and relax.  I've read some good books by Thich Nhat Hanh, including his ""Miracle of Mindfulness."" There are also some good guided meditations online, like at doyogawithme.com. I would suggest doing ""Sink into Sleep"" or ""Yoga Nidra for Sleep"" at doyogawithme.com. Headspace and calm.com are great apps too. The techs might let you bring a smartphone and a set of speakers in so you can listen to a guided meditation during the treatment.  As for my routine,I do a couple different exercises. I always start counting the breath, 1 inhale, 2 exhale, 3 inhale... and so on, up to ten,  and then start all over again at one. I do that as long as I needed to calm down. Then I did one of Hanh's exercises, Where I picture a stone falling into a shallow pool of water and settling in the sand at the bottom. By that time my treatment would start (we always did a CT scan first) and I would imagine a white healing light surround the tumor bed, and imagine the radiation was healing the space where my tumor had been. I know it may seem like new agey stuff, but if it's too crazy sounding just think of it as metaphor to help you calm your mind and relax.   I would do the guided meditations or apps at night and hold your hands the same way, like maybe with your middle fingers touching your thumbs, and then hold your hands the same way during treatment as a physical cue. I will send you a pm with a short introduction I did on meditation for my Sjögren's group, it has the links to all the resources I mentioned on the bottom. Also, obligatory shout out to /r/meditation.   PM me any time with questions."

cancer,33p0n7,ridetocumming,14,Fri Apr 24 09:27:52 2015 UTC,"Hi, i'm very sorry to hear about your diagnosis.   As great as it is to know everything that you can about your disease, i would take everything that you read online with a pinch of salt. Oncology is a field that is constantly changing and progressing fast so even reports that are a few years old can be outdated. The terminology can be scary but bear in mind that simple words can mean different things in a medical context. Your disease might not have a cure, but that doesn't mean that you can't be cured. You will be treated on a treatment plan that they will call a trial and if you respond well and stay in remission for 5 years, then you will be ""cured"". But for a doctor to say he has a cure for Myeloma then he would have to have a treatment that will cure 90% of patients (or something like that. I'm a patient not a doctor).  There is no ""cure"" for my sarcoma either, but i've met a handful of other people with it and they've all been on different trial treatments and more of us have made it to ""cure"" than the internet would have us believe. So try and keep your chin up :)    The first few weeks into a diagnosis is scary as hell. As much as you have appointments to go to and important decisions to make, make sure you give yourself time to let it out as well. Family, friends, your social worker, your doctor. A car trip, a day off, a day at the spa, a bottle of Johnny Walker.   Good luck."
cancer,33p0n7,BeetrootRelish,7,Fri Apr 24 09:58:00 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the genetic lottery known as Myeloma! First things first, use Myeloma Beacon as your primary information resource. They have uplifting reports of studies and drugs and a great community, instead of old misleading 5 year survival rates that are super depressing.  Life's gonna suck sometimes now, but with a good treatment plan this disease is getting more manageable every year. Unfortunately Myeloma is a very fluid asshole and my experience is going to be different to yours, but PM me if you have questions and I'll share my experiences. I was in your shoes almost 3 years to the day, my diagnosis came 30 April 2012."
cancer,33p0n7,97EchoEcho,7,Fri Apr 24 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry.  You don't have to be brave- you are allowed to be scared out of your wits, angry, frustrated, and any other emotions that might crop up.  You are allowed to feel how you feel!!  I hope you have a close support group of friends and/or family to be there while you cry- no one should have to do this alone.  Folks want to help you so let them, and don't be afraid to be vocal in telling them how you want them to help.  Don't read too much internet stuff- people by nature post when they are experiencing angry or negative emotions- hardly anyone posts when things turn out better than expected. Read official websites so that you know all the right questions to ask your team of physicians but don't dwell in the dark side.  Do whatever it is you need to do to keep your head pointed in the right direction- which is dealing with the situation in front of you.  Again- you are allowed to be afraid. If it sounds like something that would work for you give yourself a period of time to wallow in misery- like all weekend. Then by Monday morning start looking for ways to positively deal with what is in front of you.  No one should have to deal with this crap but unfortunately you do. Reach out to friends, find good docs, and remember not to let this illness define who you are- go live your life as much as is humanly possible."

Stay the hell off the internet until you talk to your doctors and oncologists and all that jazz. Same dx's even at the same stages still have variables, that and well it's the internet. I found out last week I can cure my cancer with sopsop and rubbing calcium oils into my skull.... lol   By the way not sure who told you you had to be ""brave"" whatever the hell that means anymore these days but you do you let other people do them, I can almost guarantee you everyone here had different reactions to getting the news. When my onco finally told me that we have to look over the horizon at new things but for now it's a done deal I think I stayed awake for a week wondering what it feels like to die.   Tip for you though after your initial flurry of tests doctors and such you'll have a lull for a little bit few days sometimes a few weeks depends on how fast your team works, staging, and all that good stuff. Go for a car ride or out into the middle of woods or even to a zoo or something and just chill. Don't do shit just decompress for a bit day few days week whatever."

cancer,33l28s,billbraskeyjr,2,Thu Apr 23 11:49:12 2015 UTC,"Background:  On April 7, 2011, Emily Beazley's life was forever changed when she was diagnosed with Stage III T-Cell Lymphoblastic Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, the most aggressive form of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. After 2.5 years of chemotherapy in her port, legs, and spine, Emily finished treatment on July 18, 2013.     Just when life was getting back to ""normal"" Emily relapsed.  Intense chemotherapy started again on March 24, 2014.  Emily was responding well on the chemotherapy, but one cancerous lymph node became chemo resistant and continued to grow.  She began radiation at Northwestern Hospital on that lymph node on July 10, 2014, and the cancer responded perfectly to it.  Full body radiation and high dose chemotherapy was administered as part of her pre-transplant conditioning on August 12, 2014, and the stem cell transplant took place on August 20, 2014 at Lurie's Children's Hospital.  We are fortunate her sister Olivia was a perfect match.  Emily is courageously fighting her battle, and is determined to beat this once and for all.   With the support of family, friends, and the entire community, Emily will win this fight!    Emily has had the wish to go to Disney World since she finished cancer treatment the first time.  That was going to be reward.  Just days before booking the trip, she relapsed in March of 2014.  She finished her treatment for the relapse, which included the stem cell transplant, and Disney talks began again.  On January 12, 2015, during a routine PET scan, three new spots were discovered.   http://www.emilysentourage.com/  The city of Chicago and surrounding communities have truly been inspired by this little girls courageous battle with cancer.  Even while recovering from a stem cell transplant, she organized a toy drive for other kids in a hospital.

A cure means no more research, less jobs (the hospital I visit is dedicated to CANCER) and less money for the top pharma companies.

cancer,33merc,charolastra00,2,Fri Apr 24 01:43:09 2015 UTC,"nope  There is no one cure. Cancer is hundreds of diseases. Each of these diseases could have dozens of different treatment protocols depending on the person being treated, where the cancer is, and how the body  responds to treatment. My cancer is fairly uncommon and in the past 3 years, a miracle drug has been introduced for relapsed/refractory patients. Millions upon millions of dollars went into research for a drug that might only be used by a few hundred people a year - maaaaaaybe into the low thousands.   The majority of people with my cancer are cured. Full stop. Sure, some might relapse - but the cure is eventually there. And since the majority of people with my cancer are young, we have a good sense of 20, 30, 40+ years of remission even with old, less effective protocols.   I work at a university. We have hundreds of researchers working to find treatments for various illnesses - cancers and neurological disorders in particular. There are thousands of universities around the world with similar labs, and hundreds of thousands of researchers just in higher ed. That's to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of researchers in hospitals and nonprofit research programs around the world. And that's even before you get to the pharmaceutical companies.

Even sadder is the case if Jess Ainscough, who genuinely did have cancer and fought it by natual means. Also wrote a book etc. She died recently. Her mother apparently used her daughter's regime to fight highly treatable breast cancer and also died. Their case is sad as well as infuriating. Belle Gibson's is just infuriating."

cancer,33l2v4,PatrickWeever,2,Thu Apr 23 11:56:19 2015 UTC,"I have no ideas on what his diagnosis might be.  As you described, it sounds fairly serious.  I do know that many times patients have to be their own advocate or have a family member help 'push' to get things done.  As far as advice goes, I'll take a shot at it....  -Give yourself permission to feel whatever emotions hit you.  This ain't easy and you're a human being.  As much as you want to hold it together, you only have so much emotional endurance.  You're about to 'level up' in that department, but it's tiring and not easy.  -""A whole life's work to just get sick eventually"".  Give HIM permission to feel whatever he feels. Remember, he's the sick one.  I watch my dad from time to time get low and wonder how he's going to get through his cancer.  It's normal.  When you've been through so much of life and it all gets reduced to one diagnosis, it trivializes much of the preceding decades.    -Make sure your support system is working.  Friends, family, /r/cancer....whatever it is, make sure you can talk to people.  It's not easy, but talking will help you get everything out of your own head."

Without knowing the DX it's hard to say anything about his condition, treatments and thingss to expect. Treatment wise at his age and depending on how slow/fast growing  it will probably be more to curb the growth and such than actual remission, but again that's just going on the little information to go on."

Personally, I would wait a few months knowing what I know about BEP. At least until you are feeling ""normal"" again. Chemo is extremely hard on your body, and your liver and kidneys often take the brunt of filtering out all the chemicals. You will have regular metabolic tests done now that chemo is done and those will measure how some of these important organ systems are doing after treatment.   To be honest I am surprised your friends want to celebrate by taking you out for an additional chemical infusion (aka drinking). I know I am going to be downvoted to hell for saying this, but maybe focusing on healthier ways to celebrate, especially in the immediate future, might be a better idea? There is just no reason to add to the damage that has already been done IMO.   PS- don't be around smoking. I know for some people that goes hand in hand with drinking, so I thought it was worth mentioning. I'm sure you know the potential lung effects of bleo, it isn't even worth exposing yourself to."

I had a bad cough, and some mild pain in my chest. It progressively got worse until I ended up in the er. They did a scan, found a tumor next to my heart, and did a biopsy.   It ended up being lymphoma, more specifically, diffuse large b cell lymphoma. I am 26.   It hits hard. So very hard. But please know that you are not alone, and there are people who know what you are going through.   My main concern when I found out was ultimately that I was not ready to leave my family behind.   I am currently on my last round of R-EPOCH, a 5 day chemo infusion, then I will be done. There is light at the end of the tunnel.   If you want, you can PM me if you want to talk/have questions/need to vent. It is nice to have someone who has been there, done that. Less sympathy, more realistic conversations."

cancer,33c1yl,Jonashaglund,3,Tue Apr 21 08:31:55 2015 UTC,"unable to eat bananas and blue cheese, as well as drinking alcohol.    Don't know about bananas but I'm told to eat them. (Different therapy however).   I can understand blue cheese.  Drinking:   ""Hi, Mr. NEHOG, how are you "" my lovely oncologist says  ""Fine considering."" I reply, waiting for the hammer to drop.  ""Good, I want to check a few things,"" she continues ""like do you ever drink alcohol?""  ""Well perhaps a glass of wine at supper time, as my cardiologist recommended it."" I reply,  ""Well... Not anymore.""   Haven't had any alcohol since!"

Couldn't do it. It was only a can of beer too but felt like shit so I avoided it until my treatment was done. I'd follow whatever your doctor told you. Maybe you can clarify with him about whether you can eat those items during the six week resting non treatment days."
cancer,33c1yl,Acidsparx,2,Tue Apr 21 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"Haha! :D Actually in Sweden where I'm from, sex is how you spell and say six. Also with five being ""fem"", some guy found ""fem sex"" pretty funny.  ANYWAY, in what sense do you mean drinking? Like just disobeying and not caring, or just trying to see how your body responds to it? I'm thinking about that as well, but wondering how it might affect it. If it's just feeling like crap for the moment, or if it actually affects the treatment itself.  That's what I'm reckoning, the doctor said that as far as they know, it's better to just stay away from it all. The whole treatment-period is for over half a year though, so missing out on those things kind of sucks, and I'm wondering of other people's experiences.  The treatment is going to be ongoing now and then for all my life since it's incurable, after all."
cancer,33c1yl,Acidsparx,2,Tue Apr 21 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"I was/am a pretty heavy drinker. I didn't want to outright disobey, so I tried having a few to see how I'd react. Only made it through a beer but didn't feel too well and figured my organs probably couldn't handle the stress of drinking and chemo so erred on the side of safety."
cancer,33c1yl,Boobsaredopes,2,Tue Apr 21 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"My son was 11 when he took Thioguanine, Procarbazine (Matulane in the US), and Lomustine. Those were all pills with Thioguanine given over 4 days and Matulane and Lomustine taken on 4th day.  He also got a vincristine drip 2 weeks after starting the pills.  The cycle repeated every 6 weeks for around 14 months.    Anyway, on the day that he took Matulane he also took Zofran to help with nausea.  For 15 days (taking Matulane is day 1) he had to avoid bananas and cheese.  After that, he had a banana each morning and cheese when he wanted.  To my knowledge, he didn't 'cheat' on the restrictions for those 15 days.  Tumors shrunk and then stabilized so it seems to have been worth it.  Best of luck to you."
cancer,33c1yl,billyvnilly,2,Tue Apr 21 18:33:10 2015 UTC,"You should ask your doctor when it would be ""safe"" to resume drinking.  All it would do is make you violently ill till you threw up :-/ ... not really mess with the drug.  Cheese, wine, yogurt, bananas, and antihistamines should be avoided, though im not for sure how long after your oral meds.  Ask your Heme/onc or the neurosurg. that prescribed it."

My particular cancer has a very, very good prognosis, but people automatically assume the worst.

cancer,3394oh,Josh3781,4,Wed Apr 22 04:57:55 2015 UTC,"There are no rules and everyone is different. Personally, I got really sick of people trying to play my oncologist/G-d (ie ""It'll be fine!"") or asking me to ""let them know"" if I needed help. Well yes, in fact, I did need a lot of help but most people are really uncomfortable asking.  The most helpful, comforting people were those who were  very concrete. Instead of asking how they could help, they asked when my next appointment was and if I needed a ride. Or if I had dietary restrictions so they could bring me a meal to heat up on ""chemo weekends."" Or if they could do my laundry, grocery shopping, or bring me trashy magazines or mindless DVDs.   Keeping me involved was so necessary and helpful. People who understood that I could flake out on a moment's notice but still invited me out (making it as easy as possible for me to participate - like by offering rides, planning activities that had parking so I wouldn't need to take public transit, etc) were angels. So many people disappear when you get sick. There's often a lot of support right at the beginning but as treatment continues, it tapers off. Once it ends, many people move on and expect you to, not really understanding the long term physical and emotional impact.   I think the biggest thing is to remember that someone else's cancer diagnosis is not about you. So much of what cancer survivors deal with from other people it making their cancer all about them - saying things that make THEM feel better and reassured, but not the person who actually has cancer. It's human nature, but try to be cognizant."

This may seem mean, but what you do or say isn't going to matter too much.  You could say the stupidest, rudest thing in the world, and it's a flashlight compared to the nuclear explosion of their own worry and grief and anger.  You could say the most beautiful, uplifting thing in the world, and again it's only a flashlight.  If you cared enough to ask, I'm sure whatever you do will be good.  Just be yourself.

cancer,3394oh,chattymcgee,2,Mon Apr 20 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"From what happened to me when I found out I had cancer, there are going to be two classes of people - the ones who think the world's going to end (have you seen an oncologist? how many days do you have left? should I be standing near you? have you made out your will? - and this was for papillary thyroid cancer, which has a 10-year survival rate of 95% with NO treatment), and the cool people (""Really? Huh. Wanna go for coffee some day?"")  Needless to say, those in the latter class I still talk to. Those in the former I told (politely) to shove it and can you finish cleaning my teeth now? (or the equivalent).  How you treat them depends on how they tell you. If they're obviously calm and relaxed about it, so should you be. If they're hyper, try your best to spend some time with them and let them talk it out with you. Repay calm with calm, repay bad nerves with time, I guess is a good way to put it."

I'd ask your Dr If you need to do another round of 131, what medications are you on for hormone replacement?  Do you have an endocrinologist?

I'm not in North Dakota, but in my state, there were two key factors in cutting through the bureaucracy and getting financial help: First, the amazing social worker at my cancer center. She was able to tell me exactly where to look, and which resources other patients had been able to get. Mayo offers social workers!   Second, I went to every thing I could in person, instead of by email or on the phone.

You have to have not worked for six months but you can apply right away to start the clock.  Waiting time and acceptance depend on the type of cancer she has.  Also, can your wife go on disability at her work rather than quit?  Do they have short term or long term disability insurance? Can she ""retire"" with better benefits?   Also there are very few financial resources for adults with cancer.  Agree with other posters that your social worker may have access to some of those.  Your best bet may be a go fund me page and tapping your friends.  For the most part, they want to help.  Also see if your friends can throw you a going away party like a spaghetti dinner for $10 a plate with raffles to raise some cash.

Instead of thinking ""oh my god, I'm so miserable"", I started paying attention to the patterns of the pain. Left thigh and hip, base of skull, right femur, left thigh/hip, etc...

What I can say is that after a year of taking Xeloda (3000mg daily, 2 weeks on/1 week off), fatigue is no longer a problem.    At the time, the only thing that really seemed to help was forcing myself to get up and move at least a few times a day, even if it was only walking back and forth down my hallway for 5 minutes.

I remember when they moved me from antiprogestin (sp?) to my hydroxeau the overlap was horrrrrrible.

This is actually my husband's third time fighting cancer (he was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma in 1997 and had a r-eoccurance in 2000) but a lot of the treatments have changed since he last went through chemotherapy.  I knew to expect some fatigue, but I didn't think it would hit him as hard as it is - his chemotherapy oncologist made it sound like it would be minor fatigue but that he could go about his day to day activities, but he is napping a lot more than he ever used to.  This is my first ever experience with cancer so I'm still trying to figure out what is ""normal"" and what is not so ""normal"".  I will make sure he gets more activity in and see how that helps."

Getting an actual video phone can be very simple to use and help a great deal. Or even just a prepay Walmart smart phone if they don't have internet where he lives. I'm sure he'd love to see the child often and video chatting can be great.   I'm not sure if you can easily record skype convos however. I'm sure there is a way, or perhaps another program.   I live with my father and mother, and we are about 3 hours from all of our family. My sister has 2 kids and love grandparents as most kids do. Skype helped my dad a lot, especially during chemo and after surgeries when he couldn't travel, or be around the kids when they were sick. We were able to Skype with them through smart phones and it made a huge difference. The boys would get so excited to Skype after school and run home from the bus stop every day."

A few weeks before I went to Israel - my first trip since diagnosis - another dear friend passed away. I took her Hebrew name as an addition to my own while I was in Jerusalem, not coming anywhere close to honoring her in the way I'd like to.

As a cyclist I do a 5 hr energy and crank it out for a hour or two, shower, and afterward it is the most peaceful time of my week. But if you can isolate your environment down to just you and the task at hand I think it will help.  Good luck, and don't think of your results as pass fail. A lot of it is mindset.

I had a mastectomy and am now essentially cancer free. Its now 6 weeks after surgery and I am feeling great! Just because it is cancer and just because it is rare, doesn't mean that it can't be conquered! Now I just have to deal with chemo! As someone going through it and as someone with friends who have gone through it, I can tell you that the initial weeks are the worst.

Every case is difference and one would think that with you being well below the average age your prognosis would be well above average.  I hope you get good news. Last year my dad's doctor sent him for a scan because the doctor was secretly 100% sure my dad had bone cancer, and it turned out not to be that, so sometimes doctors are wrong just like everyone else.

cancer,32sqg6,squirreltalk,3,Thu Apr 16 12:26:14 2015 UTC,"Neutropenia affects your ability to fight new and old pathogens. Your body has fewer cells to mount an immune response, and the neutrophils are the first responders to infection (in med school we were told to remember them as ""fast and first""). The neutrophils are part of what's known as the innate immune system whereas B and T cells are part of humoral AKA adaptive immunity. Your T and B cells come online later after exposure, but will also be affected by chemo in their functioning. This is why you may likely be on acyclovir and an antibiotic, or may be placed on one - because your old B and T cell immunity is lessened/nuked by chemo. The acyclovir prevents shingles (varicella zoster AKA chicken pox reactivation) and the antibiotic provides some protection against pathogen exposure. If you've been exposed CMV, you may be monitored for CMV reactivation during your neutropenia and if viral load is increasing may be placed on valganciclovir.  If you're not neutropenic now, don't worry too much. As long as your girlfriend isn't sick it's unlikely she'll get you sick unless she is exposed to something new and passes that on to you without realizing it (I.e. before she shows symptoms). It is definitely something to talk with an oncologist about to determine your comfort levels. The fear and anxiety can affect physical sexuality and the LLS has a wonderful and comprehensive document here that really helped me deal with the neutropenia and my relationship. Do look over the questions to ask, and try to come up with your own.    As always, best of luck.    EDIT: CMV and viral reactivations seem to be more a transplant thing."
cancer,32sqg6,pointywalrus,2,Thu Apr 16 17:25:19 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly confused by your question.  What do you mean ""during this time""?  Here is why I ask.  My wife became neutropenic twice.  She went from ok to VERY sick in a matter of an hour or two.  Had to be hospitalized for a couple of days both times.  So, to me, neutropenia is a condition no one will want to be intimate during.  And you shouldn't, because our immune system is so weak.  However, they would tell us during treatment (for which neutropenia is a possible side effect) that we needed to not kiss, have sex, and to use hand sanitizer every 10 minutes (joking... but it seemed that way).    We didn't follow that to the letter.  We were careful, though, and she would be blood tested.  If her counts we low, we would abstain until they came back up."
cancer,32sqg6,NotDavidHasselhoff,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:35:11 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""during this time""?   I'm referring to when I will soon become neutropenic. My understanding is that this refers to to the time when your immune system is down, but you might otherwise feel okay, i.e., receptive to intimacy. Certainly if I became infected and weak as a result of neutropenia, I would not want to be getting intimate with anyone. I wonder if neutropenic to you refers to an actual episode of infection/illness/feeling crappy?"
cancer,32sqg6,NotDavidHasselhoff,2,Thu Apr 16 14:51:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I guess it does.  The only time anyone referred to my wife as neutropenic, she was in the emergency room.  I guess she had actually become infected due to being neutropenic.    If her ANC was < 1000, we were very careful and avoided anything that might cause infection.  I just read where this is considered ""moderate"" and that ""mild"" is 1000 to 1500.  I didn't know this classification existed until now.  They just told us that < 1000 was a problem.  They wouldn't administer the chemo if she was below this, so we kind of took that as the measure of when to be extra careful.  Sorry, that probably doesn't help you a lot."
cancer,32sqg6,rx_pedal,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, medical student here and would like to help you understand the term a little more.  ""Neutropenia"" when broken down refers to two things. Neutro- is in reference to neutrophils and -penia refers to a lack of, or a decreased amount.  So, what are neutrophils and why are we talking about them being low? Neutrophils are a type of cell that your body produces which fights infection. In a person with the proper number of neutrophils, when bacteria get in the body these neutrophils stage an attack and handle it for you (Ya know pus? Neutrophils are a major component of it because they're there fighting infection). This happens constantly, all the time. People only really get ""sick"" when their immune system (of which the neutrophils are a main component) can't handle it from the get go. Usually this leads to the body increasing the number of neutrophils that it makes.  Now, when someone is neutropenic this means their body has not made any where near a normal amount of neutrophils. Depending on how low this gets, you can be highly susceptible to infection, but not only that, because your body can't fight the now present infection, it is much more able to basically kick you into a hospital over it.   This is important to understand, because, yes, you are going to really monitor what you expose yourself to. When you are neutropenic (or, low on neutrophils), a generally benign infection can be devastating. This is even more important because while many bacteria are okay to manage even then, there are some out there (say, MRSA), which can be a devil to try to take care of in even a healthy person. If you're interested in learning more about this online, try googling ""infections in the immunocompromised.""  Hope this helps at all? My recommendation would be to speak with your physician about this again if you are at all confused, because it is an important topic. Ask what things would be appropriate to participate in during this time and what part of your treatment or illness is pushing you into neutropenia.  Wishing you guys the absolute best with everything."
cancer,32sqg6,pointywalrus,3,Thu Apr 16 21:41:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's an oversimplification to say people only get sick when they can't handle it from the get-go. Certain infections have a very low infective dose. The innate and humoral immune response are also incredibly important for getting sick, as I wrote in my comment below. Specifically they determine how sick one will get. If you remember your immunology there are two peaks to the immune response - the innate and then the humoral peak about a week later. It is true that opportunistic infections are seen with neutropenia, but they also appear with CD4 lymphopenia. It is true that there is very little left shift when already neutropenic, and infections are more severe.      Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that point in your description. (I also used to be a med student, before I got cancer.)"

I got away with only one hospital stay (for literally the common cold) and 25 shots of Neupogen or Neulastin through the entire six months of chemo."

cancer,32sqg6,monstersoprano,2,Thu Apr 16 15:19:11 2015 UTC,"My husband was at MSK. They basically just told us to be careful about the food he ate - i.e. everything has to be fresh and uncompromised - and wash our hands frequently, and to keep an eye on his temperature. He and I were still intimate if he had the energy, we cuddled, our dog got weekly baths but still slept with us. I traveled to see him frequently.  He got through 30 weeks of chemo with no infections whatsoever, and he got cisplatin and doxo at the same time for four of his courses. My dude felt the low platelet count and hemoglobin more than he did the neutropenia."
cancer,32sqg6,dcp522,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:53:27 2015 UTC,I too had cisplatin (A BUTT TON--so much that the nurses had to have a roundtable about how best to administer the dose) and doxorubicin. Cisplatin is the bane of my existence.
cancer,32sqg6,monstersoprano,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"Ugh, that sounds so miserable. My dude received the life-time maximum dosage over the course of his treatment and it was hands-down the most miserable of the chemo as far as how it made him feel, although the methotrexate was horrid because of the sheer amount of water they pumped through him and he had to wake up to pee all the time. =/"
cancer,32sqg6,Tiad7titnu,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:54:38 2015 UTC,"That is awful. For my cisplatin, I need to be hydrated two hours before the infusion, for six hours during, and for two hours after. Trying to pee while you're hooked up to an IV is the worst. After a while, I gave up all dignity and made my mom help me pull down my pants, lock the door, etc."
cancer,32sqg6,deathchimp,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"Now imagine all that while having a bum leg. =( He never resorted to his mother helping him with all of that, but I definitely did. The worst is during methotrexate hydration you have to measure and pH test the urine and then remember to write the information down on a sheet to present to the team. No one ever tells you how undignified your bodily functions become during chemo - from constipation to too much urine output to vomiting and spitting all the time. Six month scans were clear and I hope I never have to see him go through that again."

I haven't had one since I started this whole thing..so it's nice. And my little Hunni bun turns 5 tomorrow. I love him soo much!!!  My low is..I have been having chest congestion and a heavy feeling when I breath. And I am absolutely terrified that my cancer spread. So chest xray this morning and now I wait. Which is why my friend is taking me for a pedi to keep my mind occupied. Positive thoughts for me please!!! Have a great day guys!!

Low: Vaccine reaction has been pretty rough. My muscle swelled and knotted to like the size of half a tennis ball and I had some other unpleasant symptoms. There's only the pneumococcal vaccine in that arm, so that's for sure the culprit that's been giving me crazy reactions the last two times I got it.

But it's only been this past week that I've appreciably sped up. I went from 8:40 min/mile and higher before last week to 8:13 all of a sudden. I still don't believe it.

I've been here for 9 days. March30-April3 was my last week of chemo pump. The first two days were uneventful. But by Thursday afternoon I was in full throes of digestive tract being mad and unable to cope anymore.   I wad doubled over in pain every time I ate or drank or moved.   The weekend got worse, and I spent the entire weekend barfing, having painful diarrhea and severe pain the belly.   Monday morning, my doc admitted me to the hospital. I had WBC of .5, Hemoglobin was low too and had to get a transfusion, platelets down to 20. And of course I was dehydrated and starving.   They put me on saline and food drips. And kept encouraging me to eat. They did ct scan nothing came up , so they called it an ulcer.   Over the course of the next few days, there was an influx of doctors, all trying to figure out why I was in so much pain.   Well, I said - You gave me that SUCKY chemo that I overrespond to  - we know that yet he gave it to me again. Granted, he gave me the lowest possible dosage available. It was such a low dosage the infusion nurses had to call the doc to confirm there wasn't a mistake.   So I'm still in the hospital, trying to figure out how to manage the pain of digestion. I miss the kids. I miss being human.  High is that my husband took 3 weeks off, so the kids' situation is all handled. I'm on the downhill portion of being in the hospital Woo!"

Last Monday the 6th I was admitted to my local cancer ward and started chemo on Tuesday the 7th. I had another round and a half in the hospital (it was mostly uneventful -- I just felt tired and occasionally had some tummy stuff but meds dealt with that pretty well) and was released yesterday. It felt really amazing to get the damn PICC line out of my arm, come home, and eat a delicious salmon and broccoli dinner mostly cooked by my wonderful gf. I guess that's my high -- (and definitely let me emphasize how grateful I am that chemo has not taken too much of a toll on my appetite or stomach yet). The low? I suppose just still wrapping my head around all of this, the uncertainties, anxieties, etc. It's not an acute feeling -- just this constant background hum."

This isn't something anyone ever wants to wrap their head around, you know?

I called my doctor's answering service and he was slightly concerned when he called back because if there is something coming out, something could be going in. However, I'm seeing him first thing in the morning anyway so we decided that, unless it turns bloody, wait until morning and we'll replace the needle.  This morning was chaos and a little depressing. I'd be really upset if this turned into something serious."
cancer,32rgfp,pacificsun,2,Thu Apr 16 02:54:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've spoken to the doctors who know your case and have differing points of view. What's important is that you understand why they are suggesting what they are and make the right decision for you. So go back and ask if you're unclear.  In general, studies have shown that Her2+ve tumors have a higher chance of coming back, and that adding Herceptin can delay the time until it comes back and potentially improve survival, especially in higher risk women.    In small node negative tumours, the chance of recurrence is lower and the benefit of herceptin is smaller. Furthermore, it doesn't come without side effects (most importantly with the heart), so in general medical oncologists (I am not one) consider all of the features of the tumour and the patient in recommending whether or not herceptin (+ chemo) is right.  Sometimes when the tumor is ER+, that means you can receive tamoxifen, so maybe the benefit of herceptin is even less.  Again, more info is needed that the med onc who knows you (or whoever the patient is) would put together in making a recommendation."
cancer,32rgfp,beamseyeview,2,Thu Apr 16 17:56:41 2015 UTC,I would.  http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1406281 This paper is considered practice changing in the field.
cancer,32rgfp,disposethis,2,Thu Apr 16 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"I think the controversy is an artifact arising from a misinterpretation of trial limitations in the following way:  As an example, a 2011 Cancer Care Ontario guideline that recommends only patients with tumors >1 cm receive adjuvant herceptin based it's findings on a pooled analysis of the HERA, NSABP B-31, and the NCCTG N9831 trials.  Pooling results showed a benefit associated with offering herceptin as adjuvant treatment for these women with the following patient characteristics: positive or  node-negative,  tumour  greater  than  1  cm  in  size,  and  primary  breast  cancer and  who  are  receiving  or  have  received  (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy.  These patient characteristics reflect the patient populations in the trials themselves.  The problem with the >1 cm caveat is that this distinction isn't based on biology, it's at least partially based on not expanding the trial findings to patients that weren't studied.  However, biologically, would you expect herceptin to have a different effect on a tumor .9 cm versus one 1.1 cm?  I would think not.  There are data showing only ~5-10% tumors under 1 cm over express Her2, but this ASCO report on the results of two retrospective studies showed that small (<1 cm) tumors have a greater likelihood of recurrence (two to five times greater than that of women with HER2-negative breast cancers) and an increased risk of metastasis among women with small HER2-positive tumors, compared to those with HER2-negative tumors.  So, it seems that practice is changing and adj herceptin following chemotherapy is becoming preferred practice.  As always, options should be presented to patients and the patient should make their own informed decision."

cancer,32rgfp,DaveTime,4,Thu Apr 16 03:09:08 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd love for it to be the case, I do think it is unreasonable.  Cancer is an incredibly complex topic that varies hugely between individuals.  We have incomplete and ever changing data on solutions, and to expect a person who has not studied it for a very long time to provide answers is something that will almost certainly end with a poor result.  Intelligence is not related to knowledge on subjects which must be studied to be known.  You can not intuit or simply logically work out information about such topics, unfortunately.  There is a reason why you go to a specialist to deal with such issues, and I strongly recommend that you take advantage of that ability.  To do any less would be to sell yourself short.  There is a reason why there are specialists who deal with cancer, and I suggest you make use of their expertise.  I wish you the best, truly."

cancer,32pkyp,elsynkala,3,Wed Apr 15 18:06:37 2015 UTC,"ARRRGGGHHH! This should not be an issue and I'm sorry you're having to deal with it on your own.  I've had catheters several times but the longest I've ever had to wear one was 7 days.  The only useful information I have is to not worry too much about what happens below the junction taped to his leg. You can change the bag to suit John's daily needs, i.e., you can use a small bag that readily fits in his pants leg if he has activities planned. Or, if he's mostly in bed or watching television/resting, use a large bag that doesn't need emptied as often.  The really critical part is what happens at that little junction where you connect the plastic hoses - above that the rubber tubing that goes into his body needs to stay super clean. The best way to keep that clean is to not mess with it at all and don't damage the rubber hose - a hole in that would allow bacteria right into his bladder.  So when/if you need to adjust tubing, be very careful not to accidentally squeeze that rubber in the clamp or poke it with scissors etc...   Changing bags and cleaning the plastic tubes can be done every day if you need to. To clean them after use, change bags and use warm water and soap on the bag you removed. You can run it right through the tubing and into the bag, swish it around in the bag a bit and then open the valve - rinse, repeat, air dry.  Sorry I don't have much more information."

But there's another reason some women get actual cancer at an early age and that is the increased incidence of adenocarcinoma vs. squamous. It's more difficult to detect. No one knows why it's on the rise."

cancer,32o0h5,noctem92,4,Wed Apr 15 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, a Pap test would check for any abnormal cell growth it's just harder to detect this particular type.  90% of all cervical cancer is squamous type. Squamous cells are a type of skin cell. They are present inside as well as outside. Squamous is latin for scales (like fish scales not like weighing scales).   The prefix adeno indicates glands. An adenocarcinoma is a cancer of the cells that make up the glands. The glands of the cervix are what keep it lubricated and help inhibit or promote sperm travel depending on hormone ques.  Squamous type cancers have slightly different risk factors than adeno. For instance, smoking is a risk factor for squamous type cervical cancer but not for adenocarcinoma of the cervix.  Both are closely correlated with HPV though."

cancer,32ovn0,maverick5872,4,Wed Apr 15 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"Hi, I spent 25 years in Accounting/Finance with most of that in the area of Financial Planning and Insurance. I became disabled about 7 years ago and now have cancer.  The best place to find answers to questions about what your particular policy will cover is your policy. No one can answer questions about what your insurance policy covers without reading the policy. You won't be prepared to argue your case if you don't know what it says.  In reality, your biggest problem will not be keeping your insurance, but keeping your job. If you lose your job, you lose that insurance and that's when you need to worry about your 401K.  What usually happens is a person gets fired because they're missing too much work. They have to decide if they can afford COBRA. They begin to spend down their savings at this point until they can no longer afford COBRA and then they're either disabled, broke, or both.  So back it up a little and do some long range planning. The safest vehicle to protect your assets is a whole life insurance policy. It can't be garnished for any reason by anybody. It doesn't count in the calculations for government assistance (welfare). HOWEVER, there are a couple of drawbacks:   now that you have cancer, if you don't already have one, it would be expensive to buy and maintain. Cancer is a mark on your permanent record. Workaround: consider a policy for your wife and put your money in her policy. you don't get to collect that money - it goes to your kids. Workaround: a whole life insurance policy can be used to help you get a loan later when/if your credit takes a few hits from medical bills. You can also borrow from the value of your own policy.   About your 401K. Wait for your prognosis but you have a balancing act coming up. You can legally withdraw the money from your 401K without tax penalty if: ""amount of unreimbursed medical expenses (>7.5% AGI; after 2012, 10% if under age 65)"" (from IRS website) If you have a very good prognosis and you withdraw the money to pay for medical expenses, you have time to recoup those funds in your retirement account. (Keep in mind that a diagnosis of cancer also often limits the amount of time you'll spend in retirement).  If your prognosis is fair to poor, fuck it. Take the money out and put it in a life insurance policy naming your wife or children as beneficiaries. Divorce your wife and let her have everything. You're now asset-less in case you can't afford to pay your medical bills and it also cleans up any estate in advance. Sorry to sound morbid but we're talking about having a poor prognosis here.  Figure out how much it takes to pay (or contribute) to your regular household bills, the percentage above that which you normally use for entertainment and savings, can be used as a set percentage every month which you pay toward medical expenses that your policy does not cover. Include in that percentage what you pay for over the counter medicines not covered by insurance - that could get expensive. Sort the bills by original date due and pay them off according to oldest first. When you've reached that percentage, stop paying for the pay cycle and begin again next time.  If some become delinquent, call the payee and tell them your plan.  Something you don't know yet is that there are lots of charities that provide assistance for cancer patients. If you don't have a coordinator assigned to help you with that, ask.  I'm about to run out to start my 3rd cycle of treatment so I'm going to cut it short/long. One last piece of advice: get organized now. You need a place to keep your medical bills and receipts for tax filing next year no matter what you do. It will save you a ton of money. This includes mileage for doctors/hospitals/treatment/blood draws/imaging/etc...  I'll be back. Ask questions.  Edit: if your wife does not have a policy that covers you, it might be time to push for a job with insurance that will cover you. If this is unfeasible, make sure she and the kids have their own policy or know how/where to get one when the time comes. And get her whole life insurance regardless of what happens with your cancer diagnosis, it's just good sense."
cancer,32ovn0,JonnyBoomBots,3,Wed Apr 15 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"It's impossible to give any accurate information without knowing the specifics of your policy. My dad had really good insurance, but it still became costly in the short time he was sick. Insurance doesn't d cover a lot though, and it was very obvious that they covered a lot more than they wanted to.  It really is all business with them, their bottom line is all they care about. My only advice is don't expect them to understand anything."
cancer,32ovn0,garygnu,2,Thu Apr 16 04:33:35 2015 UTC,"Expect them to be extremely stubborn about the yearly max out of pocket. If your oncologist wants you to do interferon, it will also be a pain in the ass. Interferon is an obscure and expensive drug for cancer treatment and may or may not be on their list of specialty drugs. My copays were thousands a month."

cancer,32ovn0,fixitben,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"While others have said similar things. Each insurance is different. For me personally I have decent insurance and once I meet my deductible max $8k a year they pay 100% of treatment and prescriptions which is a life saver. One pill I was on was $16k a month even at 20% that is a chunk of change. One thing I would look into is a cancer policy though Aflac or another company. I signed up for one after I was diagnosed stage 2 in 2005 and when I went stage 4 in 2013 it has been a life saver. Most of the policies have a clause that you can sign up, but as long as you don't make a claim for 1-2 years you will be covered after that point regardless of stage when signing up. I just signed up with a second cancer policy at work in December and will be eligible to collect in January of this coming year. The policies don't pay for treatments, but they give you money for getting treated or for flights or travel or hotel. Currently I am on a trial in Florida and fly from my Home town in Houston Texas every other week to get treated at Moffitt in Tampa. Without a cancer policy this travel wouldn't be possible financially and it was the treatment I needed and was only available at this hospital.  Another word of advice is find a melanoma specialist where ever you live and if one doesn't exist then travel to one. I know to many people that aren't here any more because they didn't follow that advice or waited to long before they did. Here is a list of specialist. I am not saying they are all rock stars, but it is a place to start. https://www.aimatmelanoma.org/getting-a-diagnosis/find-a-melanoma-specialist/ . I would also look into trials for ipilimumab for stage 3 people. I have read many things on doctors thinking that interferon may not even work, but they still use it because it is the only stage 3 approved treatment. Ipilimumab is a much easier treatment and I think in the next year or so it will be approved for stage 3 treatment. So if you can find a trial with it go for it. Those are just my thoughts on what I would do if I were you at your stage."

For the first month and a half after we were told I might have Lymphoma until they confirmed it, my wife and I basically went from one doctor to another and then tried to not fall apart in between them.  I think that was the worst part to be honest with you.  Once you start treatment (whatever that may be) and see some progress it get's easier.  I just kept marking off the chemo treatments until I was at my last one.  :-)  My family and friends were also really supportive.  I can't speak for my wife but I know just her presence really helped me get through the process.  If you want some specific things she did for me let me know but just being there was the most important part.  I know you're two hours away but hopefully you can arrange something so you're not so far...  What kept me positive is that we live in an age where having stage 4 lymphoma isn't a death sentence like it was and the vast majority of us make it though.   Good luck to both of you."

We are just ready for him to start treatment and get on his way to beating it.   It's great to hear you are in remission. I am doing my best to at least be there for him on days that he will have chemo, sadly I am a student and unable to put that on hold."
cancer,32mzui,funboixero,5,Thu Apr 16 03:05:52 2015 UTC,"Be supportive of course. There is the old thing saying ""Which is harder? Being sick, or watching someone be sick."" There will be a lot you don't understand, because you can't. But try to listen. The people I liked the best when I was sick weren't the people coming to visit me out of some sort of moral guilt. It was the people who treated me as human being. It's hard for people to understand that you are a person on top of being a patient. Also send him some of his favorite games or when you do visit him, bring him some of his favorite food. Hospital food stinks most times, so a soup from Olive Garden or a real pizza can go a long way. Take a second though to find out his food restrictions. Sometimes during chemo they restrict fresh fruits and veggies. The biggest thing you can say to him, ""I am here if you want to talk about it, and I am here if you don't."""

cancer,32mzui,evesjohnson,5,Thu Apr 16 03:02:53 2015 UTC,"I think the most helpful thing for me was when people asked me what I needed during the chemo/cancer phase of my life. Sometimes people can really go hard on the ""YOU'RE SO STRONG AND BRAVE!!"" stuff, which is of course very nice but sometimes it just isn't what you want. I would have loved to have someone ask me if I needed to talk or vent. I liked when people brought me tiny little care packages, as I couldn't do a ton of shopping. I also enjoyed being treated like a totally normal person on my ""off chemo"" weeks. (My chemos were bi-weekly). So on the days that I felt normal, I wasn't too into any cancer talk. It'll be difficult being away, but just talk on the phone lots, text, and visit when you can! He will get through this, it isn't as rigorous as other cancer journeys, though that does not make his fight any less brave or worthy. Positivity will do wonders, as will humor.  I wish you both so much luck and light!"

cancer,32mzui,averagejoe25,2,Sat Apr 18 06:16:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear about your fiance. He's in for one hell of a ride with the  treatment regimen he'll have. I have a pretty rough cancer myself (Philadelphia positive ALL which is only possibly cured with a bone marrow transplant), and my treatment regimen was really tough. It's hard to realize that you might not make it. It's hard to reconcile your possible death when you're 26 (I was also 26 when diagnosed). When you look at statistics and see a low 5-year overall survival rate, it destroys you. I spiraled into a deep depression and avoidance of basically everything. I didn't want people to know anything about my treatment; I didn't want to talk about it with anyone. I thought that I wouldn't have a future to look forward to, so why should I go through any planning activities? I didn't even want to buy any clothes because I thought ""what's the point if I only get to wear them once or twice?"" I wish I'd talked to a professional much earlier to learn how to properly and positively cope.    So I say to you, be mindful of how he's reacting to the diagnosis, and the treatments. Support him as well as you can, but watch for maladaptive coping mechanisms and encourage him to talk to someone if you see them. He may not think that you'll be able to ""get it"" or get what he's going through, and may tell you so, and it will hurt to hear. I know I hurt my parents when I told them that. So encourage him to speak with survivors, or support groups, for those times when you won't be able to make him feel better.    It gets easier, though. It gets easier the longer one has to learn how to cope with cancer and what it means for his life. It gets easier the more treatments one's had, to learn the cyclical side effects of the regimen. It gets easier, but not for a while. Today was the day his previous life was stopped. Weddings, and houses, and all that may feel like it's off the table for him. Let him process this in his own way, unless you see it become maladaptive. Be there to support him, but also take your cues from him. This transition period is one of the hardest times.    Best of luck to you both."
cancer,32mzui,Leinna,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:55:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like he's going through different stages of accepting his diagnosis. He was initially quite positive, but upon learning he is stage 4 he seems to have entered an angry, ""why me, why at age 26, why, why, why phase"" It's pretty hard to see him going through it, but I am doing my best to just listen to whatever he wants to vent about. I will suggest him getting in contact with survivors or finding a support group. Thankfully he is still staying positive about our future, he planned an engagement party for us in May because he wants something to look forward to, so I""m happy he has some things to keep his mind off the cancer.

In 2012, I was diagnosed with Diffuse Large B Cell NHL (for a second time, first time it was called Burkitts-Like, and it was in 2002).  I remember one of my doctors saying once, that ""if your going to get cancer, Lymphoma's a good one to get""  Didn't seem to help at the time, but I'm proof that there's a good shot at getting a cure.  Treatment is going to be rough, and there will be a lot of decisions and difficulty in your future, but you can do this.  They have come a really long way in not only treating the disease, but treating the side effects of treatment.

I'm glad you are being tested if you have a significant family history and hopefully this will help other men and women in your family as well.  Doctors do have a particular fascination with fruit... don't know why.  CT scan and bone scan is 100% standard in this circumstance.  In some cancers PET can be useful at detecting distant spread that wasn't otherwise seen, but isn't generally used here.  PET's major benefit is in saying whether an identified lymph node or mass is cancerous or not - it's a functional scan and only good for masses bigger than 7-10mm.    The CT is actually better at identifying small spots and if was clear that is the best sign.  (Don't be swayed by all the lymphoma posts on this site as it's a very different disease)  I also agree with you that the most important thing is getting on with the chemo and getting treatment started"

Definitely helps calm my nerves since my family was pestering me about this question. My Pop-pop (grandfather) has been going through all of this over the last 6 months as well, so everyone thinks it's the same. But, he had lung cancer that now spread to his adrenal glands so, different ""animal"" as my oncologist put it, haha!   My family and I were just talking about this today. Before my Pop-pop, before me, we thought chemo was just chemo. One medication for all cancers, diagnosed the same way, etc etc. It's absolutely crazy to think how much more complicated and unique per cancer/stage/etcetc everything is!"

I had the same scans as you in the beginning and then an mri in Dec. And I had already started chemo at that point. April 28 is when I have surgery for a double mastectomy.

cancer,32ls6u,DaB0mb0,3,Tue Apr 14 20:30:52 2015 UTC,"Just finished 4 cycles of ABVD and honestly what I learned is that if affects everyone differently. I got sick af and had a pretty rough time with it but another patient in his 20s I met going through the same thing was much less affected by it. My doc explained that everyone's body metabolizes the drugs differently and there's no way to tell how it will go until you start so don't get too wrapped up in trying to predict how you'll feel. The good part is it worked damn well and mid-way through treatment my scans were already coming back clear. That alone makes the bit of a nightmare it was 100% worth it.  This Lymphoma patient forum has been an AMAZING resource and one of the things that kept me sane when I would start questioning what the hell was happening to my body http://forums.lymphoma.com/forumdisplay.php?s=7c0255ab3a6f68c3b2e9beb5ecd93b9b&f=6  As for the lady I feel your pain. I was dating a guy when I found out and ended up breaking it off bc I moved across the country to be closer to my family during treatment. Long distance + chemo seemed like too may odds stacked against us but from a female perspective I encourage you to be super honest with her and tell her exactly how you feel. If it's meant to be, she'll tough it out with you. The longer you wait to fill her in the more difficult the news will be.  It was also a lifesaver to have people to talk to who had been though this before so feel free to PM me anytime if you need someone to talk to about it. Sometimes you just need to complain to someone who actually knows exactly how you feel, no matter how amazing your friends and family are at supporting you."
cancer,32ls6u,shibbyshaw,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"That was very insightful, thank you. I may take you up on your offer in time"
cancer,32ls6u,charolastra00,3,Wed Apr 15 03:56:32 2015 UTC,"The bad news: You have cancer! The good news: Even at late stages, Hodgkin's has a very high survival rate. I should know - I was misdiagnosed for more than 5 years and had the highest amount of cancer my oncologist (head of lymphoma at one of the best regarded cancer centers in the world) had ever seen. Almost 4 years later, I'm still here!  ABVD is standard and you can probably expect 6 months. If I had to go back and do it again, I would have asked for BEACOPP. BEACOPP is administered in the US, but not nearly as commonly as in Europe. Older studies show that is has a slightly higher risk of secondary cancers (primarily leukemia or MDS) but also a higher chance of progress-free survival (meaning no relapses). ABVD is totally doable though and even though I had a lot of crazy side effects both in the long and short term, I was able to work full time through treatment and only missed a handful of Mondays (had chemo every other Friday for 6 months). Make sure you get a pulmonary function test every cycle as well. Bleomycin can cause lung damage (it did for me) so they pull it from the treatment plan of many people as time goes on. I was told that bleo has the highest risk for complications while doing the least amount of good, and my oncologist thinks that it will no longer be part of standard protocol in a few years.  You might also get radiation for your chest mass. Doctors are more likely to recommend radiation to men than women because of the risk of breast cancer. You will also receive steroids as part of your pre-medication. Beware - they made me 'roid rage in which I couldn't sleep and also ate everything in sight sort of like Cookie Monster.  As far as the young woman, everyone is different. I can say that in my experience, friends and significant others in their mid to early 20s are AWFUL at handling life threatening illness. I had been with my boyfriend for several months before I was diagnosed - living with his best friend and his friend group had essentially become mine when I moved cross country after college. He acted fine and then dumped me out of nowhere 3 months into treatment, and then couldn't understand why I didn't want him at my apartment or to ever talk to him again. Obviously, that is just MY story, every situation is different. I also managed to date through treatment, even though I gained 60 pounds (on a body that was already quite overweight thanks to years of misdiagnosis where I was given steroids regularly) and had a rapidly thinning crewcut as a 23 year old woman. YMMV"
cancer,32ls6u,disposethis,3,Tue Apr 14 22:10:15 2015 UTC,"Are you being treated in the United States?  If so, ABVD is virtually the only chemotherapy that is used, and the overwhelming probability is that that is what will be recommended for you.  BEACOPP / escalated BEACOPP is often used in Europe for late-stage disease, and the reasons for why one is chosen over the other are complicated; if you are truly interested in the nitty-gritty details, you can PM me.  I do not use it in the frontline for anyone to start with.  There are essentially no other regimens used in the frontline setting.  For patients with stage III/IV disease, http://www.qxmd.com/calculate-online/hematology/hasenclever-hodgkins-prognosis-score-ips gives some idea of the prognosis.  As an aside, I would avoid growth factors.  If you have anemia due to iron deficiency, you should take iron, and that should be enough.  The probability that the lymphoma is contributing to your anemia, however, is very high, however, and your anemia will improve as your lymphoma goes into remission.  I have seen this occur over and over.  G-CSF is also usually frowned upon with ABVD given the (somewhat theoretical) risk of potentiating bleomycin lung toxicity.  One final plug: it never hurts to participate in a clinical trial.  There is a national randomized control trial comparing ABVD to AVD (bleomycin removed) + brentuximab vedotin; the latter agent is a targeted drug which is probably the single most active agent in Hodgkin lymphoma.  If you are close to a center which offers this trial, I would recommend it.  I would choose this for any family member or myself in a heartbeat.  source: I am an oncologist and treat Hodgkin lymphoma."
cancer,32ls6u,charolastra00,2,Tue Apr 14 23:33:22 2015 UTC,I didn't realize that AVD + brentuximab had gone wider scale. That's FANTASTIC news!!!!! Some refractory cancerfriends have seen great success with it post-failed auto SCT and I'm glad it has been picked up as frontline treatment.

ABVD has been around for 40 years, it's about time someone tried to improve it. The scientist in me likes this as well."
cancer,32ls6u,disposethis,2,Wed Apr 15 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"Well, if you do end up with ABVD, I can tell you all about A (I know it as doxorubicin, as it is weird as f), and V (vincristine). I had combo chemo but with two others included--and not for Hodgkin's, so I'm not much help there.  As for the lady, you might be surprised. I'd been dating my boyfriend for less than a month when they found my first tumor, and he ended up sleeping on the floor next to my hospital bed. (Now, having faced a recurrence two years later, he's still here.) It's a good, fast way of learning what kind of person she is."
cancer,32ls6u,pointywalrus,2,Tue Apr 14 21:10:23 2015 UTC,"A quick comment: V in ABVD is not vincristine but vinblastine, which is a related compound.  Vincristine is used frequently for ALL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but we do not use it in Hodgkin lymphoma."
cancer,32ls6u,disposethis,2,Tue Apr 14 23:35:14 2015 UTC,"I've always been curious why. They're both vinca alkaloids and they differ only in one carbonyl group. How does that one changed moeity make their activities so different? The old MOPP protocol used Oncovin (vincristine) for Hodgkin's, so both are arguably effective in Hodgkin's, but I understand that vinblastine is better than vincristine and I don't know why. How much better than vincristine is vinblastine in Hodgkin's? Also, wouldn't their side effects be similar or nearly identical because of their structure being almost identical?"
cancer,32ls6u,kwamescommies,3,Wed Apr 15 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting question.  The reality is that ABVD was designed in the 1970's as mentioned by the OP who has clearly done has research and should be commended in this regard.  I don't think that we know that vincristine wouldn't be better than vinblastine.  For that matter, do we know how CHOP or EPOCH would fare in Hodgkin lymphoma?  My guess is that they would cure many (probably most) patients, but I can't prove it.  The problem is when the bar is set so high and the standard of care accordingly so good, it becomes very difficult to demonstrate that something is better in a randomized, robust fashion.  As a clinician, a trial for Hodgkin lymphoma better be really damn well designed for me to consider enrolling a patient given the excellent results with routine treatment.  However, for a patient with AML who has relapsed 3 months after an allogeneic transplant, I'll pitch pretty much any trial out there given that the prognosis is dismal regardless of what you do."
cancer,32ls6u,charliephx,2,Wed Apr 15 07:10:46 2015 UTC,"I went through ABVD for Hodgkin's over twenty years ago so I'm not sure if I'm going to be a ton of help.  I was stage 4 when I started.  I remember that each of the drugs made me feel different. One of them made me feel like I needed to run around.  I had so much energy.  It took longer than they had estimated because my blood counts were too low to get treatment every other week toward the end.  That's pretty normal and nothing to freak about. In my case it was effective but I needed to go through radiation, some more chemo and a bone marrow transplant.  I've just celebrated the 23rd anniversary of my bmt so it all turned out well.  My girlfriend at the time was very understanding and stuck with me through the whole thing. It was a lot to handle though but we were probably younger than you are."

I had the choice between abvd and Stanford V. I chose Stanford V, it is a regimen developed at Stanford to be less toxic. I was treated at Sloan Kettering in nyc.  You may want to check that regimen out. I think the studies showed it about even with Abvd.  Bad news is that the radiation scarred my coronary vessels and just six months ago, 15 years after treatment I had to get a triple bypass at the age of 44. Bummer.  Good luck!

There was a poorly done study published in 2005 suggesting that it was worse than ABVD, but a more recent paper from 2013 in JCO gives equivalent results.  The chemotherapy portion is much shorter in Stanford V which is nice.  Most clinicians in the U.S. (including me) do not use it, mainly out of lack of experience."
cancer,32ls6u,ginab0bina,2,Wed Apr 15 07:22:29 2015 UTC,"Keep it up buddy, I had 8 months of chemo in 2014 and last thursday I got the result of a scan I did earlier in March and it came out bad, still some affected lymph node around my left lung and I'm now back on the treatment wagon.   I learned I had cancer December 20th 2013, and the week before that I had my first date with my still-as-of-today girlfriend. She is an angel and if she wouldn't had wanted anything to do with taking care of a sick guy for a year I would had totally understood but she saw something in me (Still don't know what) and she decided to be there with me for the fight and still this week, is ready to battle with me for round 2.  So, yeah, it's possible to start a relationship while battling cancer but also, and I would had totally understood if she decided to move on. Not many people wanna commit like this in their 20s with someone sick.  ALso, this seems like a good thread for me to ask some questions about the Hodgkins to others, ABVD obviously didn't finish the job the first time, my doctor told me about another type of chemo, possibly radiotherapy and also bone marrow transplant. I know that when a cancer come back, it come back much stronger and the odds are a lot lesser than the first time around. In case none of this is working, my question is : How long can you actually survive with Hodgkin's lymphoma not cured? And can you have a good quality for the rest of your life?  I'm going in fighting but I'm being open that anything can happen."
cancer,32ls6u,ginab0bina,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:23:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, very sorry to hear about your relapse.. I'm curious to hear the answer to your question as well.."
cancer,32ls6u,evesjohnson,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:12:29 2015 UTC,really curious to hear this answer as well. this is a question i asked multiple times during my treatment and have never gotten a straight answer on.
cancer,32ls6u,evesjohnson,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"So I did pose this question today during my consult with the oncologist, and while he expressed some reticence to entertain the notion, that he did.  As everyone says about everything else in lymphoma treatment, every case is different. In my case, since the greatest offender is a lymph node in my chest which is a) partially obstructing my airways and b) wrapped around the superior vena cava, I could expect the bloodflow away from my brain to be gradually cut off, gradual bloating of my head and strangulation, as well as the likely slower progression of multiple organ failure. He wouldn't specify a timeline for these events."
cancer,32ls6u,evesjohnson,2,Wed Apr 15 17:52:03 2015 UTC,"First, I'm so sorry you're having to go through this.   I had Stage 3 B several years ago with all of the classic symptoms leading up to diagnosis & treatment. I went through 6 months of ABVD and have been pretty clear sailing since then. My main symptom was extremely severe itching all over my body. It was so bad that there were many nights before I began treatment that I didn't get any sleep at all because they were spent on the bathroom floor scratching my legs bloody. The positive news in all of this is that I felt relief after my first treatment. The itching wasn't totally gone until after I completed the second round, but it was very quick. So, hopefully, if you're experiencing any symptoms associated with Hodgkins, they will be gone quickly. Of course, there's no guarantee of that because everyone is different.   ABVD wasn't as awful as I had pictured in my mind, honestly. Although it did suck, I was prepared for much worse. Stay on top of your nausea, don't wait until you feel sick to take it your meds. If you keep ahead of it and take you nausea meds when recommended, it should help a lot. I've heard with a lot of Hodgkin's patients that after a while foods become kind of bland. For me, anything that was not salty or sweet just wasn't appetizing. Be aware of that, but don't over do it on those foods either because a day of eating brownies, pickles, and chips will not fare well with your nausea (...not like I did that or anything...okay.. I totally did). I'm sure your doc will tell you this as well, but be very aware of fevers and illnesses & if there is any doubt in your mind, you need to go ahead and go to the hospital.   I was engaged (now married) while I did treatment. I can tell you, having someone there that you care about makes all the difference in the world. My husband was a huge support and a great help. I definitely agree with some of the other posters that it's probably best to let her know what's going on sooner rather than later. If she's serious about your relationship, it won't matter to her and she'll want to be there for you.   If I can say one last thing, try not to let yourself suffer in silence. It's hard, but when you need help or support, try to reach out to those around you. I really wish I had. I'm not saying you've got to spill your guts to anyone who comes across your path, but having people even just to play card games with in the hospital really helps to lighten the mood and make a really crappy time a little better... but sometimes people feel awkward and don't know what to do around people with severe illnesses, so sometimes they end up doing nothing. I encourage you to build your support system or have friend/family help build one for you. Take care of yourself!  Edit: a word"
cancer,32ls6u,ParkaBoi,2,Wed Apr 15 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, oh my god, the itching is so bad, especially at night.. thankfully extremely liberal amounts off lotion and benadryl have helped me along, but I can't wait for it to go away. After the second treatment sounds like a great time. I'm going to take the liberty of managing my nausea and appetite on my own, so I'm not terribly worried about that, but I'm very glad to hear I could have rapid improvement before the negative effects of chemo kick in.  Thanks for your wisdom."
cancer,32ls6u,to_be_discreet,3,Wed Apr 15 04:07:17 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I hate to hear that you have itching too. I wouldn't wish that crap on anyone. Unfortunately, my onc told me that there's not really much you can do to get it to go away without chemo. The one and only thing that helped me was ice... no idea why, but I tired absolutely everything. Benadryl does help with being able to sleep through it though, so that's good! Hopefully, yours will go away just as quickly & you can get some peace from all that torment. Just think of how good you'll sleep once it begins to go away! I hope that it's something you can look forward to in the midst of treatments & side effects & whatnot. There were some friends who wanted to throw me a yay-no-more-itching party. Maybe you'll want to do the same to celebrate? :)"
cancer,32ls6u,to_be_discreet,2,Wed Apr 15 11:05:24 2015 UTC,"About a year before I was diagnosed I started itching like CRAZY! My legs and chest the most, I would scratch for hours into the night. I am only just now realizing it could have been connected to my cancer!? I did not realize other people had this.. Sorry just had to butt in, that blew my mind to read!"
cancer,32ls6u,to_be_discreet,2,Sat Apr 18 06:22:35 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Big journey ahead, huh? Keep your head up, this disease is tough but you will beat it!  I finished 4 cycles of ABVD about a month ago. I was diagnosed at stage IIA, so I was quite lucky and my situation wasn't quite the same as yours. It took me four months to get rid of the cancer completely and it was very effective. My onc said it was likely I would be 100% cured, and the same goes for later stages. The journey is an exhausting, inconvenient pain. Chemo will most likely make you quite fatigued, and you may deal with some nausea and hair loss. It's obviously different for everyone, but as long as you find some solid coping mechanisms you can definitely do it. As for the girl, I can say as a female that if someone I was newly dating told me they were sick, I wouldn't dump them. Is she the type of girl to not give up on what she wants? If so, I wouldn't worry, especially if this has been in the making for a while. Just be honest, tell her how you feel, that you don't want to break it off, but understand if it is too much for her. I wish you the best of luck on your journey pal. Feel free to pm me if you need to have a chat or have any more questions!"

It's a relief to read from so many people that came through this pretty much unscathed, in this thread and elsewhere on the interwebs.  So it's been a week since my first treatment, and I have a question for you. How long did your negative side effects (for me: nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, everything tasting and smelling like those fucking drugs) last after the first treatment? After each successive treatment?  I'm concerned because I experienced some relief from my B symptoms, and some negative side effects, but I'm already returning to my pre-treatment state (B symptoms present, no chemo side effects) and I'm worried that maybe I metabolized the chemo drugs out of my system more quickly than maybe other people do. I know there's nothing I can do to increase the frequency of my treatment, but if I were really driving this ship here, I'd be administering my treatment weekly, not biweekly. I really want to be brutal to this 11cm mediastinal mass in my chest, but my oncologist is super by-the-book and believes that american cancer guidelines are the goddamn bible (which I'm sure his liability insurer agrees with, but have we figured out scientifically that biweekly is better than some other treatment frequency???)"

While it's certainly good to be optimistic, it's also very beneficial to recognize the reality of a serious cancer diagnosis. While there isn't nearly enough information yet to speak about treatment and survival, it's important that she have a serious discussion with her oncologist regarding outcomes and goals of therapy."

Sometimes going all in actually shortens a life and makes it more painful than it needs to be - treatments can be very harsh, as you know. Sometimes palliative care extends a life and makes a person more comfortable than fighting the cancer with everything you've got.  There comes a time in ALL our lives, cancer or not, when fighting for life makes life more difficult and shorter. it's a balancing act and the best way to manage it is with knowledge.   But let your mom be positive while you gather that information. it's my suggestion. She's going to be caught off guard if she is completely focused on a rare positive outcome.  Does that make sense?"

He needed that job to keep his apartment and health insurance.  Even before I got sick, I was a big supporter of a national healthcare system. Now, I'm working harder to make myself more attractive to Canadian and British employers to move permanently to a country that wouldn't hang me out to dry if I got sick again."

cancer,32k79d,lhpcwshc,7,Tue Apr 14 13:32:15 2015 UTC,"My dad passed away about 3 weeks ago, after receiving a terminal diagnosis 2 years ago.   For me, the first couple of months after the diagnosis were the hardest of all, even harder than now.  There is no way to deal with it properly. I cried at work, in the shower, in the car.  I poured my heart out to anyone who would listen.  I thought of my dad 24/7.  I almost couldn't function properly.  You just have to take it day by day.  Time will pass and life will go on no matter what, so you just have to ride it out.    I've thought about it a lot and I realize that, for me, one of the hardest parts of a person you love dying is realizing that they won't be in your future anymore.  They won't grow old, they won't see your kids grow up, you're going to have to move on with your life without them in it.  This is the reality from the second they receive a terminal diagnosis.  That's when you start realizing all that you're going to lose.  So it's perfectly normal that you would grieve that massive loss, even though the person is still alive.  After a couple of months the shock of it wore off, and I found it helpful to be ridiculously, stupidly hopefully.  In denial almost.  I just always, always hoped he would get better and pull through, even when I knew it was impossible.  I think because of this things between my dad and I were able to almost go back to normal.  There truly was a lot of happiness during this time.  Now that he's gone - I don't know.  I am just so sad and empty feeling, but it's not acute.  I'm hardly crying at all, and I'm actually finding happiness in my son, my work, my life.  I think I'm doing okay - and I attribute this to all the grieving I did when he was first diagnosed.  I guess the only advise I have is that while it's totally normal (and even helpful) to grieve while the person is still alive.  Don't give up on the person, don't treat them like they're already gone.  Cherish your time with them.   That's my story.  Your results may vary :)"

I think in all the existential angst, they forget that ultimately your diagnosis is about you, not them. You're entitled to feel and process things in a way that you're comfortable with and you don't owe anyone a different attitude. One of the reasons I found it much more reassuring that my husband was treated in a pediatric unit for his sarcoma was that the attitude overall was so much more positive. Whenever you stepped out of that area of the hospital, it just felt like people going through the motions while waiting to die and that can be horrifically distressing for anyone.  There is still life, before and after and during cancer. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You're right - you're young and still have things to do and look forward to. That's all that matters."

My cancer was discovered during at CT in the er, but it was a full 4 more weeks before we commenced treatment of any sort. Look at the bright side - If your case were emergent, your doctors would most likely be treating it as such. You yourself waited a month before doing anything, and are getting ready to go on vacation. It doesn't appear to be an emergency, so a week or two to see a surgeon just isn't that big of a deal in most cases.   On the other hand, if you are experiencing new significant symptoms, contact your dr. to let him know. He can't re-prioritize you without all the facts. Best of luck."

To you 18 months may seem like a long time but to me it happened in the blink of an eye.  You know how time goes faster as you get older?  Well, you may not have noted it, but during cancer treatment time slows down to a crawl.  You never get that ""oh it's Friday again"" feeling.  You know what hour of what day it is constantly.  But, when you start back on a normal life, time speeds up like crazy.  At this much time out, the last 18 months feels like 6 weeks, and the 18 months of illness and treatment feel like 10 years.  You will recover, be patient.  Before you know it you'll do something that surprises you like run up the steps or touch something cold by accident without it hurting.  You will never feel as bad as you do right now.  It's only going to get better, but it's going to take time.  And the best part, at least in my estimation, is that when you feel better, nothing physical even registers anymore.  I can go lift for 90 minutes or hit the bike hard for an hour, and even though muscles are burning and failing it's nothing compared to the chemo.  If anything bothers me I ask myself ""is it worse than chemo"" and I usually realize I can handle it.  For full disclosure, only one thing has passed the ""worse than chemo"" test, and that was kidney stones a couple months ago.  Kidney stones are worse than chemo.  So I advise not getting them.

cancer,32guqc,Draconan,2,Mon Apr 13 19:15:14 2015 UTC,Different is the right word.  I don't imagine caregivers have it any easier than patients do.  I always had my hands full dealing with tests and symptoms and what not.  My family could only watch and they were painfully aware that they couldn't do anything to ease my burden.  As a survivor being a caregiver sounds scarier than what I went though.
cancer,32guqc,chattymcgee,5,Mon Apr 13 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This sounds totally wicked, but for a while, I resented the fact that I, at 23 (and then again at 25), had to deal with cancer while no one older than me in my family had ever had to do so. And then I thought about it for a while and realized that I'd probably lose my shit if I had to watch either of my parents get chemo. The helplessness would chew away at me, I think. I'd rather take it on myself than be a witness."
cancer,32guqc,cecilsaxon,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:02:50 2015 UTC,I think you are right and the same thought helped me deal with the cancer far better than I thought I would.

cancer,32guqc,MagickOrchid,4,Thu Apr 16 01:11:23 2015 UTC,"Hey DCP522, the chemo brain is very real, and I'm so very sorry you have to deal with it. Research finally acknowledged that it is yet another unfortunate side-effect of treatment... For how long and how intensely seems to correlate with certain treatment regimens. Non-medical people don't really understand it AT ALL. Your description of what you're dealing with now, post-chemo, nearly matches mine. My colleagues kept telling me to suck it up.. but how do you respond to that when your interior metal state is so fucked that you can't remember the words that you know should have shut them up. BUT BUT BUT ... I'm five years out from treatment now and I can absolutely, positively tell you that it DOES get better. You'll have some good days soon, and then, the good days come faster and better, and then suddenly you're back to you. Albeit a different you - treatment has a way giving ""perspective."" In the past, I would get angry, now, I just get frusterated. I was lucky enough to find a truly knowledgeable psychiatrist - her practice was highly attuned to the psychological impact of illness and trauma. Got on some good meds (Effexor helped A LOT - and adderall sometimes because I still have problems staying awake). Exercise is great, and probably the ideal approach, but going to yoga sucks when you have to stuff your bra because you had a partial mastectomy and you can't get it fully fixed until the rads heals up or whatever the case - your body has been through a trauma.  Some are capable of getting back into exercise immediately, but for some it's not so easy. But, again, no matter what, IT DOES GET BETTER. Your body heals, slowly or quickly, usually alternating between the two. Thought I would never stop crying all day, but suddenly one day I didn't cry. And then two days in a row, then three...It's still touch and go - but good and bad days are just part of life, I guess. Take it easy on the bad days, and enjoy the good ones. Don't lose hope, getting through what you've just been through might seem unreal right now, but there are beautiful books, and beautiful places, and beautiful people, like you. Stay strong my friend.  xo"
cancer,32guqc,akikazeshini,2,Mon Apr 13 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"I asked my doctor this question last week. I have lost so much due to the chemo brain that I worry if I survive I will not be who I was. I am a programmer, but I can't program anymore as I can't remember any of the programming languages I used to know. I have forgotten quite a few concepts in computer science as well. The kicker is that I graduate this semester, so some of this stuff is fresh and some of it (like the programming) is years of stuff gone.   His response was that eventually it will come back once the chemo is finally out of your system, but he doesn't guarantee it will come back right away."

You may not think you're retaining or that you lost languages that you learned - but it's still there.  I see the brain function loss as similar to physical function and digestive function loss. It comes back, but it's slow. We can try to rush it or roll with it. And what we put our attention on will grow.  You will get it back eventually. And perhaps, you may even be able to make new connections in ways that you wouldn't have before, since they have never experienced the ""far vision"" or ""It's not quite as important as that"" perspective that you get when going through chemo. Maybe it will turn out to be an advantage in the long rung. And you'e so young, so maybe you'll become a mutated super hero."
cancer,32guqc,evesjohnson,2,Thu Apr 16 01:17:20 2015 UTC,"I am about two months post chemo and I am slowly feeling more normal. Sometimes I deal with a little PTSD. (The thought of a needle makes me so, so nauseous). Sometimes my brain is a little scrambled, I am a little more forgetful. But it's important to do things that you dreamed of doing once you were done chemo! Obviously don't overdo it, but I have finally started hiking again, I fixed my car, and am going back to work in a few days. These things REALLY make me feel like I am moving forward and prove that it does get better. I used to feel irritable and weepy a lot too; it IS going away, slowly but surely. Short answer? Yes, it will end and you will feel better. If you feel like you need it, seek therapy. It does wonders."

cancer,32ix9l,Rivaladversary,2,Tue Apr 14 03:52:57 2015 UTC,"1st) Are you sure it says stage 3 not grade 3?    2nd) Hi. I'm sure this is incredibly surprising and new and difficult to deal with.   It's great she got herself checked out and now knows what the problem is and can take steps deal with it. From your post it sounds like she had a CT and a biopsy. Correct me if I'm wrong and she already had more extensive surgery.  You've posted part of the biopsy report, which confirms this is cancer, and it unfortunately shows this is an aggressive type of endometrial cancer (or rather, two different aggressive types), but it doesn't give us any idea how far the cancer has spread (stage).  Stage is an important determinant of whether the cancer is curable (it usually is possible to try) and how likely it is to come back after surgery. Chemotherapy and radiation may likely be used to reduce the chance of it coming back. The CT could give you an idea if the lymph nodes are involved, but most of the prognostic information (including depth of invasion, cervix involvement, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node involvement) is obtained by having surgery to take out the uterus (and likely take out the lymph nodes here) then looking at all of that under the microscope to see where it spread.  So, I would be happy to be honest about staging and prognosis but there just isn't quite enough information yet. Feel free to pm me if you have more questions"

Yes- grade is how abnormal the cells look under the microscope, which is a marker for how aggressive they are  Stage is the extent and size of a cancer, how far it has spread  My comment stands then - she will get more information from her oncologist about the next steps for her particular case, which I expect starts with surgery (depending on the CT results)"

cancer,32ix9l,BioChemistryStudent,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:32:26 2015 UTC,"The most worrying part to me, (From a Science, not medical perspective,) is that the report you have linked breaks their histology findings into two types of cells in the cancer. One of them being Estrogen Receptor positive, and the other being Estrogen Receptor Negative, as well as being clear.   There are good treatments for ER+ cancers, tamoxifen is the classic one. ER- cancers are alot harder to treat, clear cell cancers even more so.   From what I'm seeing in my brief look at the literature, surgery is the best option if it's possible, and treatment options get worse from there. It's a good sign that the rest of her organs are clear, they might have caught this in time that surgery can solve this, but I don't want to get your hopes up. You need to talk to her doctor, with her, and decide how you want to approach this.   I'm sorry this is happening to your mother."
cancer,32ime9,oflo23,2,Tue Apr 14 02:16:16 2015 UTC,"I am not too familiar with an Ependymoma, but I do have a grade II astrocytoma and some information on how things went for me which I hope helps.     I had a 95-99% resection in October for my tumor.  My surgeon sent me to a local general and radiation oncologist.  All suggested I do radiation, and chemo wouldn't be effective in my case. I had the idea that only radiation or ""watching and waiting"" were my options. I opted for a second opinion and went to a major brain tumor center somewhat near me - UCSF.    I saw a neuro oncologist at UCSF and she told me about a clinical trial I was eligible for.  There are very, very, very few clinical trials for the type and grade of my tumor.  I take two forms of chemo therapy and I started 8 weeks ago.  The information I got from my local doctors just happened to be outdated, and UCSF is just ahead of the game.    Do you see a neuro oncologist for your daughter?  Better yet a neuro ongologist that specializes in pediatric brain tumors?  What phase is the trial at St. Judes? And is it being run by a neuro oncologist?  I cannot stress how important it is to be seen by one.  Brain cancers are a whole different ball game and it is important to see someone who is a specialist.   If you are feeling unsure of what to do, I would say get another opinion or go back and ask more questions at St. Judes.  Ask more questions about the medications.  You could even look at a major brain tumor facility and see what they have to say.   In my case, one medication is already commonly used for brain tumors - Temodar.  The other chemo I take which is technically the trial drug has been around for a long time and initially used to treat bladder and kidney cancers.  It has shown to be effective for another type of brain tumor based on how it works that is similar to mine.  It is called Everolimus.   I am so sorry you are going through this.  I am 27 years old with a 15 month old daughter.  I could not imagine having to watch her go through something like this.  I wish you and your family the very best of luck.  It breaks my heart to read that you have to deal with this."
cancer,32ime9,lovestherain87,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:17:12 2015 UTC,Thank you for sharing your story with me. I think she will be getting Temodar as an oral chemo after radiation - if we choose to stay on the trial.

I don't know anything about the trial she is on. And I don't know about potential benefits for chemo when this tumour is completely removed. I do know that for St Jude's to conduct a trial they must have clinical equipoise - that is there is uncertainty among doctors about which way is best. Check out the documents you got from the trial people, or call the research coordinator to ask about this specific question and what the rationale is for chemotherapy.   It is important to realize that you are totally right and can withdraw at any time, but that needn't be based on one doctor's opinion"

cancer,32ime9,SilentLettersSuck,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:22:47 2015 UTC,"We have had similar discussions with oncologists in regards to my wife's Anaplastic Astrocytoma treatment and though different, it may be relevant to your situation. With the chemo she was put on (Temodar) the normal treatment was 6 months but she continued on to do 16 rounds. The reasoning was this: Although there was no data showing a benefit to continuing, there was no data showing a disadvantage to more rounds. We spoke with our favorite oncologist and she helped us to understand that there is a difference between no data existing showing a benefit and data existing showing negative repercussions. Following this train of thought (coupled with as much research as we could do to confirm these claims and statistics) we took each round of chemo as it came, and talked before beginning about the benefit of possible aid to the difficulty of the side effects from it. When she determined that the reward did not outweigh the risk any longer, she, with approval from her oncologist, ceased her treatment to allow her body a period to recover.  Tl;dr- A difference exists between ""no data shows"" and data shows a negative effect. Take each round as it comes and weigh possibility of reward to possible risk"

cancer,32i5yu,Labrat33,2,Tue Apr 14 17:34:35 2015 UTC,"I'm looking to get her on my insurance right now because she's on medicare, but it sounds like they only allow children to be dependents.    Medicare with proper co-insurance should be sufficient. My wife has this and we've paid zero for her health care since she started on Medicare. However, that said, I believe that should your mother become a legal dependent on you, she may be qualified to be on your insurance--however I'm not an expert in this field.   As to the oncologist's office... It does sound like they are being very unhelpful. There is a potential they are violating law too, however it is state law so this depends on what state the doctor is in.   (sorry most of this is unhelpful...)   I feel badly for you, it is hard enough when people and things work as they are expected to. When you have a doctor that is not doing what is required, that makes it much harder. Do talk to the nurses/office manager who may be able to help you."
cancer,32i5yu,NEHOG,2,Tue Apr 14 01:12:51 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry about how crappy the relationship is with the doctor. It may help to specifically mention before the appointment that you would like a family meeting with him and not the PA, or if your mom is uncomfortable being treated by them and it's irreconcilable it can be a reason to switch.   From the cancer standpoint, it sounds like you really have a handle on what all the steps have been to get to this point. Yes it was stage 4 the moment they found the liver tumours, but the goal was (and maybe still is?? I'm not clear on this) to try to shrink the liver tumours in order for her to have curative surgery.   Sometimes, when the  cancer has only spread to the liver, and it won't make the liver 'Swiss cheese', it can be cured by taking out the colon and the liver. It is usual to try chemotherapy first to help make it an easier surgery and to make sure the cancer can be controlled in order to prevent putting your mom through a difficult surgery that wouldn't help in the long run.  It sounds like the cancer unfortunately grew on chemo. Talk to the doc but this probably means it is unlikely to become resectable and unlikely to become curable.  It sounds like you and your mom both have that feeling already.  This doesn't mean that palliative surgery to help her diet or relieve obstruction is off the table (has she met a surgeon?), and it doesn't mean she can't have happy and quality filled time with you and your sister. Talk to your doctors about helping her reach that goal   Edit: I took a stab at translating your oncologists intentions through for story, but really it's best to discuss with him and clarify treatment intent, and goals of care"
cancer,32i5yu,beamseyeview,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:01:38 2015 UTC,"This sounds really terrible I'm sorry you and your family have to deal with this.   Almost all hospitals have patient advocates and if you haven't already, it might help to talk to them about your situation."
cancer,32i5yu,clorpt,0,Tue Apr 14 00:44:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I can tell you that with CRC there is no cure for metastatic disease, once it's spread to other organs there is nothing that can be done other than slow its progression and control symptoms until the final weeks.  Your mother may have some quality time, and that may be a few months to a few years.  Median life expectancy with metastatic CRC is about 36 months, but that depends on stage at diagnosis, age, other morbidities, etc.  You should also know that unless they have been given explicit permission from your mother, no caregiver (including doc, nurses, etc) can tell you anything about your mother's condition without breaking patient confidentiality.  Anything you and your sister want to know about her condition needs to come from her until (or unless) one of you enforces a Power of Attorney for personal care because your mother is incompetent or failing.     If it's a case of her wanting to know and no one is telling her, this might the time to consult a lawyer.  Your mother, and the rest of you as her family, need to make informed treatment decisions, and you can't do that without the informed part.  All the best to you all."

cancer,32i5yu,disposethis,0,Tue Apr 14 15:45:36 2015 UTC,"I re-read the case and what I posted, and based on what OP stated here:   The oncologist wanted to shrink the liver tumors before the surgery to keep them from growing as quickly. He says that with the amount she has they're inoperable since her liver would be 'swiss cheese' if all of them were removed, and that a liver transplant is off the table.   it seems like the condition beamseyeview noted   patients with M1a disease and resectable liver mets   wasn't met, and my summary remains true, unless I'm missing something here.  If I'm incorrect, I'm happy to revise or delete, but based on what OP said, I'm not wrong.  Or it it ""there is no cure for metastatic disease"" you have an issue with?  ""there is no cure for most metastatic disease"" better wrt mCRC?"
cancer,32i5yu,rbrumble,2,Tue Apr 14 16:17:10 2015 UTC,"I understand you were trying to say that it seems incurable based on the given information.  I just thought it would be helpful to throw in the clarification.  Yes the issue is saying that ""in CRC there is no cure for metastatic disease"", since it is one of the few solid tumour sites where that statement isn't always true. Others are thyroid and testicular.   Also, some cancers which are stage 4 are staged that way based on locoregional involvement but not distant mets and may still be cured  Not to take away anything on the ""liquid"" side, /u/disposethis cures leukemias and lymphomas relatively often"
cancer,32i5yu,beamseyeview,2,Tue Apr 14 18:02:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that in this case cure is unlikely although without the full chart and review of the imaging, it is impossible to comment.  The statement ""there is no cure for metastatic disease"" is wrong, however.  While the large majority of patients with metastatic disease are not cured, the blanket statement that metastatic disease is uniformly terminal is not true.  Now your revised statement that there is no cure for most metastatic disease holds true for all solid malignancies with the exception of germ cell tumors."

It's important that these patients are identified and discussed in a multidisciplinary fashion"
cancer,32i5yu,beamseyeview,2,Tue Apr 14 05:10:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. To add to it for the OP --- HIPPA violations are serious, and doctors won't tell family anything without HIPPA authorization unless they're in the presence of the patient who agrees that the information can be shared, although mom can sign HIPPA release forms for various family members. The doctor will then be able to discuss things with you. Power of Attorney is more for medical decisions should your mother become incapacitated, but it is important that you know who your mother wants making medical decisions should she be incapacitated, and what her wishes are."
cancer,32i5yu,pointywalrus,2,Tue Apr 14 01:11:34 2015 UTC,"I mentioned POA only because if OP was the named person, the point it becomes enacted is also the point at which her mother doesn't need to consent."

I brought my ID, her ID, her medical card, and a card from the doctor's office with her appointment dates on it to verify that I did have her consent, but they didn't ask for a single thing, not even my ID.    She was told that no matter what she'll be on chemo for the rest of her life, so I've already accepted that she's going to die from this.  None of us is really expecting a cure.  Being told 36 months though is awesome, I kept expecting her to be dead within the year.

Speak to your family about what you can do, what is reasonable to do, and to your dad about what he wants if he's able to tell you. Maybe this 30 day thing is a-ok with him and he'd like to try going home with backup palliative papers just in case. Maybe he knows he couldn't get the supports he needs to be most comfortable. Many palliative care units are much more cozy than a hospital and can be filled with his own stuff"

You have a right to a second opinion, get it.  Sorry I can not help more, best bet is get back to a doc and get a second opinion."

Thanks."
cancer,32g42p,DaveTime,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"the only real way to do that is to get a second opinion   Here is my purpose in asking this question... There are some things a doctor would tell you that could easily be second-guessed (and in some cases should be). There are other things a doctor would tell you that really don't need to be examined any further. An example would be strep throat. If the doctor says ""you're positive, and I'm writing to a prescription for XYZ."" Generally speaking, no one is getting a second opinion because there's no real need to--the course of action is pretty well generalized and doesn't really vary greatly from one doctor to another. What I'm asking is... is the recommendation of surgery + radiation the type of thing that I should take as ""standard protocol,"" or is that recommendation the type of thing I should consider asking another doctor about.   So, yes of course, ""get a second opinion if you want one"" is an answer you can give, but what I'm really asking is whether or not I should even need a second opinion."

cancer,32g42p,beamseyeview,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:13:00 2015 UTC,"I can tell you that surgery +/- radiation (IMRT preferred) is standard treatment for local tonsil cancer.  Chemo is sometimes added, either before or after surgery, where warranted.  What you get depends on the size, location, and how easy it will be to get at to cut out."
cancer,32g42p,rbrumble,2,Mon Apr 13 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"Actually in general definitive radiation or chemoradiation is used for tonsil cancer because the surgery can be pretty morbid. However transoral robotic surgery is emerging as a possible way to operate on early tonsil cancer and spare people radiation or allow the use of a lower dose of radiation.   You were probably thinking of ""oral cavity"" cancers but tonsil falls into the ""oropharynx"" group"
cancer,32g42p,beamseyeview,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:03:33 2015 UTC,"Nope, I was thinking of tonsil.  Please review this article from MD Anderson; the options for first-line tx are (in order):   Surgery  Radiotherapy Chemoradiotherapy Induction chemotherapy   Adjuvant options include:   radiation +/- chemo surg"
cancer,32g42p,rbrumble,2,Tue Apr 14 05:41:51 2015 UTC,"Sure, I see the picture that you're looking at.  I think that order is really based on size/stage not preferred treatment for locally advanced tonsil.  I agree surgery can be an option for select T1-2N0 patients.  For patients with more advanced disease we use definitive chemoradiotherapy.  Reading the article, under surgery it says the following:   Radiation with concurrent chemotherapy is the preferred definitive treatment for most patients with tonsil cancer because radiation therapy is associated with less morbidity, disfigurement, and loss of function than the older standard surgery.  However, a new, minimally invasive surgery... is now a primary treatment option for select patients.   I fully agree with that statement."
cancer,32g42p,beamseyeview,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"I was actually surprised to not find anything mentioning PDT in this setting.  I know it's used in esophageal, and tonsil seems like it would have the same issues wrt resection avoiding nearby structures, but I found nothing."
cancer,32g42p,beamseyeview,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:47:00 2015 UTC,"I would guess the main issue is depth?  Something like Barrett's with high grade dysplasia you know is superficial and the light gets to all the abnormal cells, but invasive tonsil ca could be deeper than you can see.  I have no experience with PDT so can't really comment beyond my guessing."
cancer,32g42p,visionarytics,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"Totally normal and fine to get a second opinion before a major treatment like surgery or radiation.  What do you mean by surgery? Is this a biopsy/simple tonsillectomy, or are they trying to scoop out all the cancer (with robot assistance). If its the latter, then that is an emerging treatment paradigm so that's probably why they don't have much experience with it. Other centres may treat with radiation alone or chemoradiation."
cancer,32g42p,OnlySlightlyCrazy,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:06:02 2015 UTC,"Early stage tonsil cancer...  If the recommendation is surgery followed by radiation, do you question that? Do you seek a second opinion?   For early stage (Stage I and II), you can discuss just surgery or just radiation. It really depends on your tumor and how feasible it is to remove surgically. For more advanced cancers (Stage III and IV), either surgery followed by radiation or just chemoradiation is generally used.   How do you find a doctor who has dealt with this specific thing before?   Go to a major cancer center. No questions asked. No small hospital should be doing head and neck cancer, in my opinion. You need to be seeing an otolaryngologist who does this all day, every day. Head and neck radiation oncology is by far the most difficult and intricate of any area, and you need to see a radiation oncologist who knows what he's doing and treats dozens of tumors like this per year. Go to University of XXX Cancer Center near you. There is strong data showing that patients who are treated at places who see a lot of head and neck cancer do better.   In the event of undergoing radiation, is it possible/reasonable to do this alone, or would the patient need to have a caretaker?   You would probably be OK, but you're going to need some close friends and family to help you through this.   I understand that all situations are different, but what exactly does radiation in this situation look like? Is it every day? How long does it generally go on for, and how long does recovery take?   Generally, radiation is five days a week for six weeks. You wear a mask over your head and neck that helps direct the beam. You will experience the effects of radiation for the rest of your life, but the initial effects will last for a month or so following radiation.   Do you go to work while undergoing radiation? Can you talk? Are you able to function physically?   I would not try to work. You can talk. It will be painful to swallow and talk. Sometimes you need a feeding tube to help you keep weight on. Sometimes you need a tracheostomy because the radiation causes the tumor to swell and narrow your airway. You will be able to function physically; the effects are limited to your tumor site (back of your throat).   I hear stories about ""this man went to university of chicago hospital after being diagnosed."" When would a person know to do that? How would a person do that? Like--if I have a doctor saying, ""we'll do surgery, then radiation,"" how do I know if I should seek help from a well known clinic? How does going to a clinic like that work out with my job?   Call the cancer center at University of Chicago. You can just pick up the phone and call. They want you there. There are usually new patient phone lines, and you can set up an appointment with an oncologist and work with your insurance company to see how it would be covered.  If your doctor is not an otolaryngologist fellowship trained in head and neck surgical oncology who treats cancer patients for the majority of his day, go see someone else.   Lastly, if I'm diagnosed tomorrow, then when would treatment begin? A few days? A few weeks?   A few weeks. The tumor has to be staged (CT scans of neck and chest), you need full endoscopies if it isn't been done, and then everything is discussed by a tumor board experienced in treating oropharyngeal cancer. Then you start treatment (whether surgery or radiation)."

Also, for many people, death is a thing to be feared so hearing how you're relatively at ease with it and are ready to accept your fate if need be can be strange, scary, and even taboo.

In the US the 'at all costs' culture as it applies to cancer survival and end of life comes from a number of places.  I just want to say I'm so sorry to hear your loved ones are putting you through that. I want to let you know that your decisions autonomy and dignity are respected. You don't need to explain or justify yourself to anyone.   In your shoes, I might fantasize saying  ""let me leave this world seeing you as a loved one rather than a selfish sadist.

Even when they are not being realistic they want to think that you are going to be the one to defy odds because they want/need you to.  I think they are just having a hard time realizing what you have come to accept - a terminal diagnosis.  I would be interested to see if opinions change on this the longer they have to acclimate to the truth.  As someone who lost a loved one to esophageal cancer I think in the beginning I would have argued with him over wanting him to fight.  After he did Chemo and was sick and miserable he told me never again.  It had helped, then the cancer got bad fast a few months later.  He wanted hospice at home and everyone supported that.  It took me time, maybe that is what your family needs too.  I hope so for your peace of mind."

I remember when I was just a teen... my dad had been battling cancer for as long as I had been alive... and he had been through countless surgeries and procedures and almost died more times than I knew...   I will never forget the day he sat down with me and told me that he was (in my mind giving up) stopping active treatments/testing etc and that he wanted to have quality over quantity.  I had such a hard time understanding that back then... but then again I was a teen and the cancer that my dad had... is genetic and I had inherited it and so being in that place and having had surgery for colon cancer at 14... my dad and I were uber close and I just couldn't imagine my life without him.  I learned a very valuable lesson... that just because someone decides that enough is enough... doesn't mean they're giving up on life... it means to live life to the fullest and with palliative care.  You need to do what's right for YOU!!! Don't worry about anything but what is best for you! (I can honestly say I understand where you're at... there is a point where enough is enough!)"
cancer,32dvpp,jahenna,3,Mon Apr 13 05:43:55 2015 UTC,"I came here to add my two cents, but I'd just be echoing what lots of other commenters have said: it's a combination of selfishness and ignorance.   I'm sorry it's so frustrating for you--and I know exactly how you feel. I try to keep in mind that everyone who's said stupid or frustrating things to me or about my cancer are doing it out of love (and also sometimes because they just don't know what to say).   Even though my cancer has spread to my bone, liver, and brain, people hold out hope that I'll someday be cured and keep making references to ""when I get better""...this used to piss me the hell off because it was a constant reminder that, hey, I'm dying of cancer and actually I won't be getting better and this thing's gonna friggin kill me. But then someone explained that people say these things because acknowledging the fact that I'll die is too painful for them, and they want to be strong while I'm still around.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't let people get to you. You have every right to do what you want with what's left of your life, and if people throw hissy fits, then it's probably because they love you and can't face the fact that you'll be gone. Focus on that. Try to steer the conversation to other topics if people start bitching at you. If they refuse to talk about anything else, then try to minimize contact with them. You need to spend the remainder of your life with loved ones who respect you and your decisions, not stress over the things a few people say. Best of luck to you."
cancer,32dvpp,Livingwithalk,3,Mon Apr 13 06:48:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you live but the states of Oregon, Washington, and Vermont have instituted Death With Dignity type laws whereby terminally ill residents may request a prescription to hasten death.  If you aren't in one of these states, may I suggest looking into Hope Hospice. Once you've made the decision to stop treatment, they can help.  Considering all the cancer deaths in your family maybe you already knew this but, just in case.  I think it's just ignorance. I remember feeling that way as a kid - that people who stopped treatment were giving up. But I was a kid. It's hard to understand adults with that attitude. Maybe they're afraid you'll think THEY are giving up on you if they tell you it's alright.  I wish you all the best for as long as possible and an easy departure."

Once the chemo is done and I'm able to function and I have an idea of how much time is left, I'm going to go do all the crazy things that I used to be scared of. Jumping out of an airplane used to scare the living hell out of me because I was afraid. I plan on jumping out of an airplane before I die. I want to go kayaking on rapids before I die and I used to be afraid of drowning. I was afraid of roller coasters, though I may skip out on that because I'm not sure how my equilibrium will be.

I have been doing physio for the last few month and it paid off on Friday with 30 minutes of cardio. That picked up my spirits as that is a ok workout and I think is not bad for just finishing chemo.  Feel even better after doing a 25 minute 3km Walk/Run.  If my legs are not to bad I can do that work out again for a few weeks till I get stronger.

Studies show that putting a high into words, even if it is something small (I pet a cute dog today) actually helps improve your perception of life.   As to the low it can feel selfish to need help but it really isn't, you are only the best caregiver you can be if you take care of yourself first. It's like putting on your own O2 mask in a plane first, you can't help anyone if you are out of action. It isn't selfish to wonder why it had to be your mom, why so late, so sick, missing things in your life. These are normal and devastating feelings that it is very important that you address.

What tends to happen is blood work comes back strange, after that the GP tells you to get your ass to a Hospital. You get to ER or a real Hospital (Find the biggest one you can) put on a mask and get treated with kid gloves because your immune system is shutting down.  They redo all the test that the GP got and with in hour or two tell you you have Leukemia and they are going to do a hip biopsy to get more test done.  I had all this done in two hours of showing up in the ER, Got a few pints of blood and in the morning got a hip biopsy.  You do not get to go home you are transferred up to a BMT floor as soon as a bed is ready.  Oh and the hip biopsy was the second most painful thing I have ever had done.

For me, it was hard to tell at first--it started out as a slight soreness, like I'd slept wrong. Over the course of several weeks, it got worse...this dull pain that was also really severe. Might be because of where it was located (and also because it'd spread to my right hip), but when it started to affect my ability to walk was when I realized it wasn't just sore back muscles.  Going up the stairs hurt so bad I'd be in tears by the time I reached the top, and I have a high tolerance for pain (I literally went straight back to work after having two of my wisdom teeth pulled, puffy face and all).  When I had to get an MRI, lying on my back was impossibly painful. I tried my best to keep absolutely still, but the pain was so friggin agonizing my foot apparently started to tremble involuntarily and they had to do the whole thing over again, with my feet taped to the board.   So I think if you have bone pain, you'll know it soon enough. I really hope you don't, that sh!t sucked SO bad. Best wishes and good luck to you."

There is a lot going on and I would definitely suggest getting a second opinion at a doctor outside of your current circle. One thing that he said was Dr's don't want to refer you to the big centers, they lose you as a patient and the $ you pay them to care for you. (I am not saying all Dr.'s do that.)  Get out of the system your in now and get seen by one that does more research. He also said that patients don't get 'placebos' in clinical trials, out of 100 that he knew about only 2 had actual placebo's.   The research that was exciting is looking at the proteins in the DNA and closing off the routes the cancer uses to move protein in and out of the cell. This ends up killing it... He also said that every time you get chemo, the cancer changes (to fight the chemo) and this is why your cancer didn't respond while Bob down the hall did. You now have different cancers even if you started out with the exact same cancer.   We are in the DC Area, and went to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore,  MD for my son's BMT. If his next PET, which he will get in June, is not good, I am going to really push him to go to NIH or George Washington Hospital in DC to explore the possible clinical trial options.

I truly believe that the lymphoma team here is among the best in the world. They are thoughtful, careful, world experts and leaders in lymphoma and oncology in general.

A case such as yours will have been discussed in a multidisciplinary tumour board with all of these people present, and it sounds like all of the steps until now have been correct, though unfortunately the treatment hasn't done enough for you.   I say this only because I strongly suggest that you talk to your medical oncologist about the next steps including clinical trials - they will be the ones that have their finger on the pulse of new developments, and connections to all of the other US centers. Take whatever information you gather online and filter it through them.

cancer,3276o6,DaveTime,2,Sat Apr 11 04:19:43 2015 UTC,I agree. Navigating that data is very difficult even for oncologists. Every trial with every outcome has its caveats.
cancer,3276o6,moration,2,Sat Apr 11 11:40:00 2015 UTC,I have access to the journals but I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole.  If somebody who isn't current tried to aggregate data on something like this they would certainly  fail.
cancer,3276o6,DaveTime,3,Sat Apr 11 14:24:15 2015 UTC,"The best data for adjuvant chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer comes from the CONKO-001 trial.  This study completed in 2004 compared patients receiving either surgery alone or surgery followed by 6-months of Gemcitabine.  The trial published both a 5-year and 10-year follow-up.  I believe this is the best designed study in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and I prefer this study to the meta-analyses that have been published employing studies of varying quality.  The data from CONKO-001 were published here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24104372  Patients receiving Gemcitabine were 10% more likely to be alive 5-years after surgery compared to surgery alone (20.7% vs 10.4%) and 5% more likely to be alive 10-years after surgery (12.2% vs 7.7%).  These results reflect all-comers and does not provide the information speciifc to your mother.  In the CONKO-001 trial 80% of patients had R0 resections - which I believe is unlikely high and probably does not reflect our current consideration of margins <0.1cm as being R1.  In a multivariable analysis, there was no benefit to an R0 resection which I believe supports this contention. Second, only around 30% of patients had no involved lymph nodes. There was clearly a survival benefit to having no involved nodes.  To make certain that chemotherapy is important for all pancreatic cancer patients, the trial analyzed different subgroups independently. Patients with R0 and N0 tumors all benefited from chemotherapy compared to no therapy in this study.    What are the take-home messages for me from CONKO-001? There is a small but real benefit from receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with Gemcitabine for all pancreatic cancer patients regardless of node and margin status.  Given the incremental size of the benefit, the use of Gemcitabine is reasonable for patients tolerating therapy well. For patients with undue toxicity, consideration of discontinuation of Gemcitabine is reasonable as the size of the benefit is small."
cancer,3276o6,Labrat33,2,Sun Apr 12 15:33:18 2015 UTC,"The above is regarding our standard-of-care therapy with 6-months of Gemcitabine. There is lower quality data from the ESPAC-1 pancreas study which supports that 5-FU/Leucovorin may provide similar benefit to Gemcitabine.  I do not typically use 5FU/LV, even if patients are unable to tolerate Gemcitabine - but it may provide equivalent adjuvant benefit.  Finally, I did not discuss the role of radiation.  The data for radiation following surgery remains controversial with disparate conclusions from studies performed in Europe and the US.  There is an ongoing multigroup study in which all patients receive 6-months of Gemcitabine followed by surveillance along or chemoradiation.  Hopefully, this will answer the question of the benefit of radiation.    Personally, I only provide radiotherapy to patients with an R1 (or R2) resection and only following completion of 5-months of Gemcitabine. The greatest risk in pancreatic cancer remains distant spread and the Gemcitabine, from the CONKO-001 trial, provides the best evidence for prevention of recurrence.  Local treatment of the surgical bed with radiation has a possible benefit so I only apply it to those patients at greatest risk of local recurrence due to margins."
cancer,3276o6,Labrat33,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:45:37 2015 UTC,"Well-summarized.  In oncology, available data are never perfect, and we often face scenarios where there is no complete consensus regarding the management of a specific patient.  In fellowship, our bias was to treat patients per the RTOG 9704 regimen with adjuvant gemcitabine in addition to 5FU-based chemoradiation.  Having said that, single-agent adjuvant gemcitabine is a very reasonable choice, and there is not high-level evidence to suggest superiority of either."
cancer,3276o6,disposethis,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:53:34 2015 UTC,Treatment patterns regarding use of chemoradiation vary greatly between Europe and U.S.; and between institutions. In 2015 there is no wrong or right answer. The approach I described is our general consensus at Dana-Farber.

cancer,3276o6,beamseyeview,2,Tue Apr 14 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"There have been many studies over time looking at adjuvant treatnent for resectable pancreatic cancer, and some meta-analyses where they combined the data from multiple trials (including these 1,2)   If you look you will find that there is probably a survival advantage to adding chemotherapy to surgery in an R0 resection for everybody as a whole, however I agree with every other poster in this thread about talking to her doctor in particular.  If the chemo is making her too sick, then perhaps for her it would do more harm than good in her specific situation."

You said ""it makes them feel better, so a polite thank you shouldn't hurt"". If it's about making them happy then it's not about you, is it? And then, isn't it hypocrisy?  It's not always easy to just let it slide. It doesn't feel right for your illness to be the excuse for someone else's celebration. Sometimes when people say ""I'll pray for you"", especially publicly, it's for them to advertise their religion, piousness and charity.   We know this. We feel it. We see it.   The last thing I wanted when I responded to this post by Michelle, was to make Michelle feel like she needed to put up with someone else to make them happy when she, herself is feeling shitty and insecure and scared.   I wanted her to feel like putting up with the occasional perceived selfishness is preserving her own strength.  Yeah, I get it. I want to tell people, ""you're in my prayers"" because it's an easy way to say ""I'm thinking of you and care how you're doing"" but that's not always the intent when people say it. So I go out of my way to say something that more closely resembles what I mean. I love you, sometimes gets the point across much better. Man, it gets RIGHT up my nose when folks expect the person who is slighted to suck it up for the sake of peace for the majority though.  It DOES hurt sometimes."

I had a radical hysterectomy - essentially I was neutered and it made me a fluffy little puppy dog instead of an unpredictable disaster.  I'm totally not kidding either.  So, the mindfulness didn't work right away. I was actually really disappointed that I had yet another therapist that had nothing to offer and just didn't understand. Granted, along with the PTSD, I was really frustrated over undiagnosed cancer. I knew something was wrong and couldn't get any medical help - they all thought it was PTSD.  Anyway, try mindfulness. It's nothing more complicated than training your mind muscle to focus on reality instead of being committed to dredging up nightmare material all day every day.

Cannabis oil isn't a proven treatment for this so if you're looking to do everything in the world, I think that means making sure you follow through with the evidence based treatments like you're planning to do, and don't stress or get arrested or get aggressive about getting something that isn't proven like you said you would be willing to do.  To make one comment on 'it can't hurt' - radiation takes advantage of oxygen free radicals to damage and kill cancer cells. Therefore antioxidants can actually reduce the effectiveness of radiation.  We don't know the interactions of the other things he might be taking so during RT I'd avoid them, or at least talk to the doctor about them.  We are always looking for the least toxic ways to deal with cancer, and select people who don't need extra treatments.  Talk to your oncologist about why this may or may not be your dad. Also make sure you talk about the real benefits of the treatment in terms of delaying or preventing cancer from coming back so that you both understand the benefits and risks"

To get access to pot in BC you need a doctor to give a script and most shops provide the doctor and you pick up your pot from one of hundreds of shops that sell pot. The police turn a blind eye and everyone wins. Look to see if you have a project in Ottawa that helps dispense pot to patients.

Too many times we see posts like this, and it's all about the alternative ""medicine"".  You're clearly not one of those.  Here's at least a bit of ammo to get you started.  There are a couple of radiation oncologists that lurk here, as well as /u/nikkip0p (you'll usually see her in the bi-weekly support threads if nothing else), a radiation therapist.  They might be able to give you some insights on what can realistically be expected out of radiotherapy.  While it won't be medical advice, it can help you get a firmer understanding of it.  They can probably at least chime in on potential long term side effects and quality of life.  I'd also encourage your dad to seek out a second opinion with another oncologist, in hopes of reaffirming that medicine really is not only his best chance, it's the only chance.    Questionable practices in Mexico - Cancer.org  Harvard Docs on Positive Margins and Radical Prostatectomy  People that prey on desperate, sick people and their families are the worst forms of life (I'm not even going to dignify them by calling them human beings).

Those moments between diagnosis and treatment with little to no information are agonizing.  I can't answer your question specifically.  I'm not familiar ovarian/bowel cancer.    Here's what I can tell you as a son whose dad is dealing with cancer.    -Make sure someone (or multiple people) accompany your MIL to her appointments when she's getting instructions and diagnoses.  It's a lot of information to process and there's a fair bit of emotion involved.  It helps to have a few sets of ears to gather all the info needed.  -Emotions will be on a roller-coaster.  I know it's obvious, but fear, anger, anxiety, sadness, guilt...you name it will be part of this journey.  Many times they'll happen simultaneously. Make sure everyone around you knows that it's ok to feel whatever they're feeling.  The whole 'just be brave' and having a tough chin doesn't win you any awards.    -Your wife's priorities may change.  She may feel obligated to help her mom with anything and everything.  I've had to find a balance between my family obligations to my wife/daughters and helping my parents.  If she has siblings that are able to help, that can be a relief valve so she doesn't feel like the only one helping.  Beyond that, good friends and neighbors, your MIL's siblings, etc are great resources to help spread the load.  Don't let your wife take this on solo.  Believe me, it will burn her out."

It damaged our relationship, and I still can't trust this person like I used to be able to. They had extremely personal information and betrayed it, telling everyone (including some people I grew to hate at times for their ""helpfulness"") about something I was not willing to share. It was forcibly shared for me, and I'm still unable to completely let go like I wish I could, even almost 8 years after it happened. I just cannot trust this person anymore.  The man's body is trying to kill him. Let him fight it in his way, and support him the way he wants to be supported, not the way you would want to be supported. He doesn't need phone calls bemoaning his fate and asking him about wills if he says he doesn't need them. He doesn't need all the eyes watching him suffer. I forbade anyone from staying in the hospital with me because I didn't want them to see me suffer. Not out of pride, but because it felt obscene for others to spectate controlled poisoning. I wanted no part of that. I only share it now because I have chosen to use my experiences to offer help to others.   Again, his body is trying to kill him. He's worried about his family and how they will be without him. He's in pain. Don't you dare add to his misery by betraying his trust."
cancer,321uc0,BeetrootRelish,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:49:56 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for sharing your experience and being candid with me. This is the kind of personal experience I think I was hoping for. I needed a perspective of someone who has been through this and who either did or wished they had kept it a secret. He has every right to fight this in any way that he chooses and I'm not going to be the reason this decision gets taken away from him.
cancer,321uc0,ms_quince,2,Fri Apr 10 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"That's a really tricky question. Usually I would say to respect the wishes of the patient but it sounds like he could use some support. And if he's thinking about going overseas then he NEEDS people around him to be in the know. I can understand silence giving him strength but if he's in the shape that you described, I don't think strong is what he needs to be right now.   The best case scenario would be that he would tell people himself. I don't think he would appreciate it if you put the word out yourself. Are your mother and brothers all wanting the family to know? Maybe come together and stress to him that his keeping quiet about cancer isn't just making things harder for him, but they're making the situation so much harder for you too. Cancer doesn't just effect the individual. It effects everyone you love and that includes your extended family. They would want to know. Just like your father would want to know if somebody he loved was suffering.   Best wishes to your family."
cancer,321uc0,Bailie2,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:56:30 2015 UTC,"To add to this, I would ask OP if she's had a conversation with her father about why he doesn't tell the others. It's an important part of the story that's just sort of left out.  Is it because he's hoping things will get better and it just never has to come up? Is it because he's afraid that this will get worse, but he doesn't want people constantly asking for updates? Is it because he's afraid he's dying and just doesn't want to talk about it? Or is he simply afraid of telling people how bad it already is?    Or is he just a very private person? Is this something that he feels no one but those he chooses should know? Does he feel like he has enough support as it is? What's his mental status? Is he depressed and withdrawn?      This is a complex situation, and I just don't feel like we have enough information to properly weigh in on it."
cancer,322n18,LuekemiaJones,6,Fri Apr 10 02:07:23 2015 UTC,"I was a young woman trying to hold down a job, so no. :P   I'm really sorry that happened to you. It's disheartening when you are made so painfully aware your story doesn't pull at the heart strings like little kids, middle aged moms, or grandma.   Of note: While going through treatment, I was interviewed by a major news network for a story about people in their 20s with cancer. My interview was almost 45 minutes where I talked about the challenges of a diagnosis when you're just starting out in life early in your career with very little savings and how difficult the relationship changes you experience are in such a transitional time of life. Instead, they gave me a minute and a half furtive looks across the campus I work on and a few blips where I said something ""positive"" or ""hopeful."" The other young adult I shared the spot with got 5 minutes of talking about how great life was. People wanted the positive spin, not the truth."
cancer,322n18,charolastra00,2,Fri Apr 10 02:34:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Thank you for sharing, that's pretty much what happened to me. I didn't present a happy story, I presented the harsh reality of the beast. The interviewer was down, the crew were in tears when I finished. She thought it was great material.  They filmed my wife and I at home, and out in the world. They filmed me at work. I thought it was going to be my greatest moment in life, as silly as that may seem.  I was diagnosed at 25 I think, 32 now. On Gleevec, doing awesome with that, but I still have the jacked immune system, which makes working in the public a pain in the ass. People treat you weird, when you're sick all the time, and get them sick.  Back to the point though, I had the feeling that the point as to why my story was cut was because it didn't have that ""positive"" spin on it. Such bullshit.  eta: I mean don't get me wrong, I understand why they did it. I don't have to like it, but I understand."
cancer,322n18,Pieter15,2,Fri Apr 10 02:41:26 2015 UTC,I was diagnosed when I was 23 and I'm 27 now. No interviews here.
cancer,322n18,charolastra00,2,Fri Apr 10 03:32:24 2015 UTC,"In other contexts, interviews are offered up because you get your face out there. In my case, I do interviews and speaking engagements fairly frequently because I speak up at conferences, wrote a pretty prolific blog for awhile, and have gotten involved with a few nonprofits and hospitals that often offer me up when they get requests for subjects from various news outlets."
cancer,31zo9g,to_be_discreet,8,Thu Apr 9 12:25:39 2015 UTC,"One important thing to do is to prior to your appointment write down your questions. What frequently happens is that we get in the doctor's office and our minds go blank and we forget our questions.   Write them down, leave some blank space between each so you can jot some quick notes as the doctor is talking."
cancer,31zo9g,NEHOG,2,Thu Apr 9 15:40:42 2015 UTC,Most oncologists will also let you audio record appointments if you ask (I used my phone to record). This was a great help to me in remembering instructions for home meds and dosing and stuff.

cancer,31zo9g,charolastra00,5,Fri Apr 10 03:51:54 2015 UTC,Welcome to the community! It's great that you are being proactive and preparing for your appointment.

Be well.  http://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/lymphoma-hodgkin/questions-ask-doctor  http://www.cancer.org/cancer/non-hodgkinlymphoma/detailedguide/non-hodgkin-lymphoma-talking-with-doctor  http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hodgkins-lymphoma/basics/preparing-for-your-appointment/con-20030667  http://www.healthcommunities.com/hodgkins-disease/patient-information/questions-to-ask-doctor.shtml  http://www.nytimes.com/ref/health/healthguide/esn-lymphoma-ask.html
cancer,31zo9g,clorpt,3,Thu Apr 9 14:57:25 2015 UTC,"GET A THERAPIST!!! This is one of the most important parts. I also had hodgkin's lymphoma, also very treatable, but that doesn't stop it from sucking. People are going to say ""you should be thankful other people have it worse than you"". Just slap them in the face and lay in a cozy blanket fort of comfort, self pity, and cute animal videos. Pretending to be ok is not an option. Let yourself feel bad. And feel good if you feel good. See if you can get some cool free wigs."
cancer,31zo9g,cuzzle,5,Thu Apr 9 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this. So much this. I want to give you a hug.  People with Hodgkin's and thyroid cancer are told all the time that it's the ""good"" cancer and it's the cancer that one should hope to get. It comes from a good place - it really does - but it feels incredibly demeaning. When I invited a friend to do the survivor's lap with me at Relay for Life recently, she got all sheepish about how she didn't think her cancer ""counted"" because she only had surgery and radioactive iodine and it was all over in a matter of weeks. I had to shake her to remind her that she should never me made to feel out of the community simply because her cancer is curable most of the time.   Larry David did this concept proud and also inspired my I'm-going-to-fake-it-til-I-make-it blog name."

I'm still processing everything so my emotions are kind of in and out right now. Crying every once in awhile and then being completely fine.
cancer,31zo9g,charolastra00,2,Fri Apr 10 02:41:37 2015 UTC,/u/to_be_discreet I think this is brilliant advice from /u/mindfulpotato.  From my experience anyway - there are serious emotional effects of cancer that are rarely addressed in a clinical setting. Everyone can focus on the physical aspects of the disease and nothing else.   I feel quite stupid now - I'm eight years out of treatment and realizing that I have issues I never worked through because I put on a brave face the whole time. Nothing wrong with crying I do it all the time now. I really wish I had thought about the mental and emotional aspects at the time.   Even if you don't go to a professional therapist I really hope you have a good support structure of family and friends who you can be honest with and who don't mind at all of you cry in front of them and are perfectly honest about how you feel.   Best of luck to you and to all of us here.
cancer,31zo9g,SuB2007,2,Fri Apr 10 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"My hematologist brought that up today. He talked about how it's normal to feel angry, sad, confused, and overwhelmed.   They will match you with someone who has gone through a similar situation if you want someone to talk to.   Thanks so much for the advice and encouragement here."
cancer,31zo9g,Kahnarble,4,Sat Apr 11 01:24:49 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the club. I'm halfway through my treatment for HL right now. It's not exactly fun, but it's manageable and there is an end in site. Keep a notebook with you to write questions down. I find that I always forget to ask stuff I think during the week. Especially leading up to it. I also really like this forum for specific Hodgkin's Lymphoma. You can see experiences of others and they have some nice resources that can answer a lot your questions. Good luck! http://forums.lymphoma.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6"
cancer,31zo9g,Kahnarble,3,Thu Apr 9 21:16:01 2015 UTC,This forum knew more than my oncologist and nurses about side effects sometimes. Love these people.
cancer,31zo9g,Kahnarble,5,Fri Apr 10 02:45:01 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the club you never wanted to be in! At least we're friendly. :)  Make sure to ask your oncologist about fertility. ABVD isn't horrible fertility-wise, but BEACOPP is (you will normally have one or the other) and ABVD can exacerbate existing fertility issues. If you plan on having children later on, it makes sense to bank your sperm/eggs/embryos if at all possible.   Ask about complimentary care at your hospital, like nutritionists, therapist, psychiatrists, reiki, yoga, acupuncture, etc. Often you have access for a lower or no cost, and they're worth it. In particular, cast aside any notions you might have about therapy and medications because your emotions go haywire through treatment and even afterward.  Make sure to call your insurance to get a sense of what they cover and how much you can expect to pay. Make sure to ask for access to a social worker at your cancer center, whether you think you need one or not, and avail yourself to any and all nonprofit and charity opportunities that you qualify for.   Good luck! I'm 3.5 years in remission from stage IV Hodgkin's."
cancer,31zo9g,billyvnilly,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:18:22 2015 UTC,"Certainly a club I never intended on joining. I don't have any currently fertility issues that I know of but that is something concerns me as I still haven't decided whether or not I want children some day.   Fortunately, I do have good insurance.   Wow, stage IV! Congratulations on remission. That sounds scary. I don't know for sure yet, but I think based on my CT Scan they'd consider me Stage II."
cancer,31zo9g,superluke,3,Fri Apr 10 02:39:00 2015 UTC,"As others have said, welcome to the club you never wanted to join!  I too was pretty perplexed about what I should ask the Dr. in those first appointments...honestly he covered almost all of the information I thought I needed without me having to ask.  One thing I do wish I'd asked about sooner was anti-nausea meds to take during chemo...it will be helpful to know what they plan to give you, what your options are to ""escalate"" if the first kind doesn't work, and if you are allowed to take anything over the counter (i.e.- Dramamine) in addition to the prescription anti-nausea meds.  I was diagnosed in November, got a clean PET scan in February after 2 rounds of chemo, and am now done with 4 of the 6 total rounds I have to have. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat!"
cancer,31zo9g,ucacheer2213,3,Thu Apr 9 19:08:44 2015 UTC,"Hodgkin's is extremely treatable, been there, done that!  /u/charolastra00 covered it fairly well. Practice and all that. Outside of those things, your oncologist will probably explain it to you, but if not:  What stage you're in  What your treatment will be (Probably ABVD chemotherapy)  If you need to do any other tests (I for example needed a bone marrow biopsy. It was actually not as unpleasant for me as it sounds!)  Realistically you can probably just close your eyes and throw something and hit someone who's done chemo who can answer any questions you have, but feel free to PM me if you have questions about that or just want to babble."
cancer,31zo9g,antelope86,2,Thu Apr 9 18:47:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for your help. Bone marrow biopsy sounds intimidating.   Did you do ABVD?
cancer,31zo9g,antelope86,2,Fri Apr 10 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"Yep! I did 6 months of ABVD chemotherapy, and then consulted with a doctor who specialized in radiation therapy (at the advice of my oncologist) but declined to do it because I didn't like the risk of secondary cancers later in life.  A bone marrow biopsy is uncomfortable, but isn't the worst thing in the world. Not something you need to be put under for either. Your doctor may want to do one depending on how far your lymphoma has progressed. I was stage IV, so she was worried it had spread to my bone marrow and wanted to check.  Fortunately I was all clear!"
cancer,31zo9g,KemNouvel,2,Fri Apr 10 03:12:53 2015 UTC,"Glad it was all clear. I don't think mine has spread beyond my neck, chest, armpits so I think it will be Stage II but I won't know until I speak with the doctor."
cancer,31zo9g,KemNouvel,2,Fri Apr 10 03:14:37 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunately the worst part about it all, at least for me. Not being able to do anything or find anything out until later. The waiting is killer.  Modern medicine has gotten very good at treating Hodgkin's Lymphoma, so just keep on keeping on. Show it your war face, or something like that!  And good luck with your appointment tomorrow!"
cancer,31zo9g,cuzzle,2,Fri Apr 10 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yes, the waiting has been the worst part. I was happy I pushed my doctor to move forward with scheduling a referral. I had the swollen nodes checked out on March 6th and got on antibiotics, called my doctor after the antibiotics didn't do anything and got a CT scan on March 30th, consult with the surgeon on April 3rd, biopsy April 6th, and seeing a hematologist/oncologist tomorrow April 9th.

I was in Hiroshima Japan just a few months before I was diagnosed. Is it possible that residual radiation from the atomic bomb dropped there in WW2 caused cancer? I actually got asked that a lot. But the plain and simple fact is that it doesn't matter. Life causes cancer, life causes death.   Now if you were a researcher looking to prevent cancer, we'd have a different story. But in idle speculation, it's a pretty meaningless question."

My son graduates from college and commissions as an Army officer in 4 weeks.   Lows:  The only reason I came back to work is they cancelled my life insurance and wouldn't reinstate unless I came back full time. Let's blackmail the terminal cancer patient.   My CT scan on Monday showed new lung mets, but my onc wants to hold chemo and rescan in July. He says it's a ""break"". I think it's doctor-speak for ""your platelets never recovered from last year's chemo so we're not doing more right now"". Will get a translation at my next appt.   I'm sad that my son will be leaving in July. I'll miss him terribly, but I'm happy he's building a career he's excited about.

My high: I'm down to my pre-chemo weight (which is huge, because I gained 60 pounds in 6 months of chemo on a frame that was already larger than preferred due to 5 years of misdiagnosis that involved a whole lot of steroids). I was able to wear one of my favorite dresses today which has not fit in 4 years.  My low: Scanxiety is killing me. My cancer center is in a really difficult part of the city to get to and traffic is a beast, so I'm scared of driving down which doesn't help. I don't really have anyone to go with me, and the side of my body that had cancer involvement has intermittent points of being sore - especially up into my armpit. Now, logically, I know I'm not getting ANY of the symptoms I struggled with for 5 years of misdiagnosis (itchy skin, lower back pain after drinking alcohol, fatigue) and that chances are the discomfort are due to anxiety and resting my elbow on a table while I use the computer, but the anxiety paralyzes me.  I have spent the past few weeks knowing I was due for a scan researching financial options to get me through a stem cell transplant with no help from anyone.

I've come a long way since then. I went to visit my ex in Boston, and we caught up, and have started to make what I hope to be a wonderful, complicated friendship. We've started to make peace. She recently admitted that it was a mistake to end things because of the cancer, and invited me to come visit.

cancer,31yyya,hoover,2,Thu Apr 9 06:33:23 2015 UTC,"My very close cousin was in a car accident when she was 18. Brain swelling led to much the same decisions with none of the experience or forethought to benefit those decisions. My aunt and uncle decided in favor of life supportive devices. My cousin lived another 35 years.   She lived 35 years in a bed, grinding her teeth when she was uncomfortable (and that was usually), and at the mercy of others to prevent bedsores, scratch itches she could not define. She could not walk, speak, read, or communicate in any way whatsoever. She spent the last 10 years in a nursing home after both of her parents had died and all other living relatives had gone on and gotten married and had their own children to care for.  Later, my father became terminally ill and expressed his desire to commit suicide before he lost lucidity. He did not do it but it was clear to us that he did not want to be intubated or fed through tubes. We called Hope Hospice who helped us care for him until he died with a little help from a quite large dose of morphine.  After those two episodes, my sister was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She did not write a formal will but she did have the sense to write a letter in her own hand stating her wishes not to be intubated or have feeding tubes should the decision arise without her being lucid. It did. Her husband and our mom were arguing over the issue when I reminded them of the letter. The doctors helped Mom and her husband make the decision to allow her to die. Again, we had the help of Hope Hospice.  Twice now I've had a diagnosis of a serious illness that could wind up in the same decision making horror. I have had a living will for the past 10 years so that it is absolutely clear that should I become incapable of communicating my desires, I do not want to be intubated or have feeding tubes.  The only thing I'm still working on is making explicit plans for my body/funeral. This is happening today, as we speak.  When a person is hooked up with intravenous fluids, they tend to look pretty damn good regardless of all the crisis that's happening inside. It's deceptive. The body gets hydrated and has a nice glow but the mind may be completely gone or so far beyond repair that life would be extremely difficult. If you can, talk to a medical professional. I am not.   But, I've seen it enough times to know that ""life support"" can mean an absolute biological support of an organism that produces no positive outcome and loads of heartache for caregivers."

One was so exasperated by my rebuffs that she told me that I got cancer because I rejected Jesus. It's not just atheists who get it. :P  My best friend converted to a different religion and became a textbook zealot. I didn't tell him until my treatment was over that I was sick because I knew I wouldn't like his response. When I did tell him, his response was unfortunately exactly as I suspected - and this was someone who knew better than most how unwelcome that response would have been.  I don't mind prayers, though.

cancer,31xohb,WannaBOld,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:35:39 2015 UTC,"I'm Mormon. I was a missionary for 2 years. My whole goal for that time was to ""invite people to come unto Christ"". But I'm not about to tell an atheist that cancer is God's way of punishing them. That's just... completely inappropriate.   Look, it happens to some people. They hit a terrible event in their lives, it turns them around, they see the light, believe in God, and become a good Christian for the rest of their lives. Those stories are amazing, and I don't doubt some of the people who experience them are grateful for those trials because of what it lead them to. So they see you going through this kind of trial and think that this is what's going to happen to you. It's very well meaning and hopeful, and they just want to see you happy.  They forget one important thing.  They don't get to decide what your trials mean.  I've met a ton of fellow Mormons or Catholics or atheists or whatever who have a habit of instantly thinking that everyone is just like them. It's a natural human reaction to be self centered, I guess, but it's an assumption that you're going to react to something the way they would. It drove me absolutely insane when I was going through treatment, and I was pretty rude to some of the people to make it clear that I didn't agree with their attempts to help. They forget to listen, and end up looking like idiots and hurting more than helping.  It makes me think of a talk I read recently one of our church leaders gave. He didn't talk about any great principle or doctrine. He just reminded us on the importance of service. He reminded us that Christ set an example to get out and serve first, love, and help. It's at the core of our religion and what Jesus and the Bible teach, and our doctrine openly condemns those who don't serve their fellow man, particularly the sick. If they aren't doing that, then they've got their priorities backwards and are pretty much screwing it up, and I'm sorry. I wish I could help out more, but hopefully this gives a little perspective. I'm really glad you do have some friends helping you out, though, and hopefully someone helps these misguided folks remember their priorities better."

She could barely breathe, but she wasn't sick enough to die. It was a week before they found a more permanent facility for her, it was the most awful week of my life.

cancer,31xohb,deathchimp,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:20:58 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/MrsClaypool.  First off, thanks for opening this up as a discussion.  I know we had our disagreements, but I really do appreciate you taking the time to ask for everyone's opinion.  I'm sorry people have told you those things.  For the most part, it's very likely that those saying you did something to deserve your situation are unable to comprehend why else their loving God would put you in it.  Rationalizing it out, the only conclusion they can come up with is surely you've done something wrong.    As for prayer, I see no harm in it, simply because it doesn't require anything of the recipient, and the provider only does so voluntarily.  I know you said you've had pascals wager thrown at you a ton, but in this case, pascals wager has absolutely no cost to the recipient of prayer.  No life changes needed, no compromise of personal beliefs, etc.  People could be praying for me right now and I'd have no idea.    Of course, prayer does become harmful if people look to it as an alternative to medical treatment.  Thankfully, very few people (as far as I know) do so, and instead, turn to prayer as a way to counter feeling helpless and out of control."
cancer,31xohb,glass_bottles,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:39:05 2015 UTC,"Ive been told my stage 4 will only be fatal because ""attitude creates reality"". Or some such bullshit, based on some book called ""the secret"".   Very rigid belief structures are indicative of fragility. If someone who has a very rigid faith has even one part of their belief structure rocked too hard, they fear their entire mental schema will come crashing down on them, so they have to try very hard to keep anything that could make them question their faith like that at bay. Including you with your heathen lack of belief, you need to be converted (or else somehow dismissed) because you question their faith and that is a threat to them and their entire mental schema. Whatever cognitive biases they can muster, will be closely held. If they can convince you and anyone else of their stupid ideology, in their minds that's a good vindication of their own belief systems.   The Christians I find less bothersome. In my life they tend to be my Irish husband's family, and being Irish Catholic they've never felt questioned about their belief system so they're not insecure enough about it that they feel the need to ram it down my heathen throat. They just say they'll pray for me, and that's nice I guess if they think that helps, I don't think it helps, but I don't feel the need to say that, I appreciate they're just trying to be kind. I don't mind what they want to believe.  It's the new age stupid ""law of attraction"" cult of ""positive thinking"" I find most asinine and annoyingly prone to trying to ram their beliefs down my throat."
cancer,31xohb,marble68,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:09:11 2015 UTC,"You don't want to believe & I'm not interested in arguing about it; but I'll try and answer because you asked.  In the end - they're praying for you because they care about you. Additionally, their expressions in regards to heaven or hell are equally rooted in a deeply rooted conviction of love for you.  It is rubbing you the wrong way - and if you are truly done with it, tell them. You can thank for their prayers because they believe they're helping you in one way or another, and prayer isn't a passing thought for a practicing Christian. It is a devotion of time and concentration of good thoughts; and it's about you.  If you think they're a real Christian, and they say they're praying for you, know that they may have sore knees and cry in desperation for you and what you're going through behind closed doors.   It really depends, but know there are people who care very much for you AND your daughter.  For Christians - the greatest loving thing in the universe they can do is to facilitate someone coming to the revelation of Jesus Christ, the blood of Christ, the sacrifice, the resurrection, the atonement, and Grace of God. I'm sure you know the Christian rules.  So this is probably redundant in many ways, but you wanted to know why and I'm going to try and explain why to the best I can without preaching to you. I'm just going to try and explain it to it's core. Take it as you will.  So - to try and really answer your question -  To the Christians, it is about one thing and one thing alone - everybody sins because we live in this physical universe. The only way to rise above this crappy existence is beyond our own ability and power; in fact impossible for mortal man to do because of what we are and how we're made [as in, we were made to be free to choose and to choose we were made into a balance of three, flesh (sinful) - Mind (choice & reason) - and Spirit (Individual).] So in the grand cosmic flow chart, you have a higher universe where the grand architect resides, God. But here's the rub. God is super holy. So holy, in fact, nothing sinful can be near him. Light and Dark, hot and cold, that sort of immutable law stuff. To the Christians, they want to chill with God. And God wants to chill with people. But God doesn't want to chill with people because he made them to chill with him, God wants to chill with people because the people choose to chill with him.  So the Christian sees everyone in this universe as here to make the choice to get there. So how do we get to be there? Well, the sin has to be atoned for. A 'sacrifice' made. For those Christians prodding you towards Jesus, what they're hoping to do (for you in a manner you consider distasteful) is bring you to a revelation that there is a God and in your current state you're not going to be with him. So they tell you to accept Jesus as your savior - because for Christians the death and resurrection of Christ is the 'catch all' atonement. The ultimate sacrifice for sin, and thus presence into the higher plane to chill with the creator, God, is not through painting someone's house or bringing over food when life is kicking them in the teeth. In the end, none of that really matters because it has nothing to do with atonement.  Thus, the most important thing they can do for you, is to try and facilitate you to manifest faith in yourself and choose to chill with God and as part of that to just seek the answers you need from Him.  Common decency and tact, however? People don't think, sometimes. I really wish I had a better answer about that.  More importantly, I wish I had an answer or some type of rationale for your daughter.  Frankly - I believe this world and this life are a heck of a lot more complicated and there is a heck of a lot left that ripples out throughout time and distance because of choices everyone makes. I 100% believe, but I also 100% know that I don't understand; or can even explain why I believe or the seemingly contradictory columns of faith. For example, the discovery of life on another planet - even alien intelligent life - doesn't mean my faith is wrong; it just means those revelations present to me the truth that I'm pretty much incapable of understanding everything and that my belief and faith is imperfect and.. well.. ""i'm doing it wrong."" Not badly, just imperfectly. For me, I've always known. It has never been a question for me. I don't know why. I'm super pro science. I'm super pro research. I 100% believe that understanding science is understanding for the sake of understanding. I'm also 100% in the belief in that we see through a dark glass darkly, and for me and my journey towards the eternal chill is one of personal growth and knowledge. I have my own demons and faults so it's not my place to point out someone else's eye splinter when I have a board in my own, but I believe with everything in me.  My faith and understanding won't be perfected till my spirit levels up; and without the atonement achievement, I don't have a way into the eternal chill. And unfortunately, leveling up autosaves and there's no starting over.   So if I were your friend, I'd approach you about it; but I'd try to still be your friend even you didn't like what I had to say if you'd let me. I'd still frag you for camping - but it's all good. I may not be the friend you'd watch porn with, but I'll have a beer with you and have a good laugh. In moderation with all things, says the creator of the universe. All is a pretty expansive word when uttered by that person.  So you asked why, and it's really because from the way they see the universe; that what I'm telling you is really really important. Like, holy cow, you better figure this out and fast because otherwise, we're going to be chilling with God but you won't be there but we want to chill with you and kick it across the universe for a few years just because we can.  Deriving from this core, fundamental belief, is a realization and thus a basic, driving, revelation that the only real ""good"" is Jesus Christ - so pretty much everything they say and do is focused around trying to get someone else to accept what they have. For them, it has given them peace, calmness, reassurance, and some deeply and unexplainable sense of companionship with the creator of the Universe. They are genuinely happy and feel real, palpable joy in this.  Now, as you are obviously aware, that can be very irritating if you are not participating in it. Ironically, the Christians consider this evidence of the spiritual struggle they they are engaged in, because their beliefs are that they're to be actively performing a dutiful obligation to tell others; and the Christian faith tells you that bringing light into the dark can be difficult.    As in: ""He's an atheist and doesn't like to hear that, well of course he doesn't want to hear about it because he is comfortable choosing not to have faith and believe.  We believe that everyone will choose to go to the eternal chill once they understand.""  So they keep pressing.  If you tell them no, and the keep pressing, I'm sorry. I don't know the circumstances, but I'm one to believe that that is not the best policy except if I'm extremely pressed to act.   Interestingly, that has happened on rare occasion that I felt overwhelming compelled and thankfully it worked out every time. I'm sort of a idiot and stubborn, so my copilot really has to press the issue.  Anyway, sorry - to continue: their faith connects them to a spirit that causes them genuine anguish over your not having the same peace, calmness, joy, and reassurance that they have.  They have something deeply fulfilling and they are pushing to share it with you.   As someone who had (has?) cancer themselves, I have an issue with the passive aggressive ""are you wanting me to tell you kids you went to hell after you're gone?"" comments.  So, in the end, remember (I now you know the rules of their faith) that to Christians, acts are vanity unless they are acts that flow from the Holy Spirit and done in secrecy. If they feed the homeless then post it online, it does nothing for them spiritually and could even be considered being boastful and fake. The challenge (IMHO) for many Christians is there is a lot of confusion about acts, their role in their spirituality, and being a generally good person.   I think a lot of Christians who feel like they want to really witness to people forget to wash some feet. I'm no different. I forget all the time, or frankly can't bother my lazy ass to do it - because I'm a ""bad"" Christian. In reality, I'm imperfect, but I believe I will become perfect. I've got my demons I fight, my personal anguish.   For many other faiths, bringing you a cake gives them favor in the eyes of their creator. For a Christian, it varies widely. It's almost like an evolutionary trait - a religion that relies on acts has a high likelihood of adoption because their members can be great people. It can be overboard ""let me give you this flower on behalf of the church of...""  Hopefully you have people in your life who are nice and good people who you have no idea about the spirituality. Stating your atheism, I don't know the likelihood on this. Not to stereotype, but most atheists make it a personal mission to ask about other people's religion and spiritual beliefs.  So anyway - it doesn't matter what you think of prayer. If someone is genuine in their faith, and their prayer is earnest and honest, it's a personal, emotional sacrifice they are making on your behalf out of love and caring for you.  Hopefully, you can appreciate that and see it for the value that it is; because it's not a cake, it's something very, very different but still of value. You simply have to choose to see the value.  It is much easier to see when you attribute the actions to a deep driving kindness. It's from love for you and what they've found that means quite a bit to them.   Cancer sucks- HTH."

Is it kidney cancer or another form of cancer with a primary tumor in his kidneys? That can make a big difference (or not).   Some chemotherapies can prolong life with quality of life, even if the prognosis is poor. That's something your uncle would need to decide with the consultation of his doctors, and largely would have to do with his age and his healthy otherwise.   Some people have had success with changing their diet drastically - organic foods, juicing, vegan, etc. Is it a cure? Probably not - but it might give him more a sense of control. Quitting smoking would also be helpful. On the other hand, it might only add months if that and it is up to your uncle to decide.  As to what you can do to help, could you visit him? Now would be the time to go before the disease progresses. Call/Skype him, show him you care. Check in regularly. A lot of people are around at first, but it starts to drop off. Send him cards and little surprises. And, most importantly, no matter what his decision is please support him."

I was diagnosed with stage IV lymphoma a month after my 23rd birthday and even though my cancer is very curable, 3.5 years later I am always waiting for the other shoe to drop.   It's not just the cancer. It's trying to piece my way back to trusting people again after so many of my friends and family - even my own parents - ran away terrified and unable to deal, much less offer support. It's getting back on my feet financially because the cost of living was ""beyond my means"" and my credit was no match for cancer on an entry level salary. Or get over my fear of relapsing to move to a lower cost of living area or change jobs. And dealing with losing my fertility long before I had planned to have children. I live life in 6 month stints in between scans, always expecting the worst.   My way of dealing? Treat everything like a story in the making. We've faced risks that we couldn't plan for, so now I take risks that I can plan for to keep those mental muscles in shape. Face the fears that you can choose to face. I'm much more comfortable being called ""brave"" or ""fearless"" for continuing peace work in Israel during the latest war or going up in a prop plane for a flying lesson than for putting one foot in front of the other after a cancer diagnosis.   It's a struggle every day to not let cancer define me - especially since I spend a lot of time talking, writing about, and advocating for young adults with cancer and other serious life threatening or life changing illnesses. But I'm still a world traveler. I can play the clarinet. My hair is badass. I have awesome taste in music. And THOSE things are eclipsing cancer with every passing day.  Give it time. We're rooting for you.

cancer,31up9w,bookingly,2,Thu Apr 9 03:30:25 2015 UTC,"A really great way of doing this if you were diagnosed between 18 and 39 is through First Descents, an organization that sends survivors on a one week adventure therapy trip to surf, whitewater kayak, or rock climb in small groups across the country. I went rock climbing despite being afraid of heights and it changed my life. I might not have climbed the highest or the fastest, but I reached my top climbs and even managed to rappel without peeing myself. The camp itself is free (with awesome food, just saying) and they offer travel scholarships. I recommend everyone go - especially if the mere idea of the program freaks you out. :)  My plan was to paint murals throughout Israel in joint projects with Arab and Jewish kids. Unfortunately, the war broke out the 2nd day I was there and that meant that many of the projects were cancelled because many were very close to the border with Gaza. It's disheartening, but I felt a lot of hope talking to other people my age from all ethnic groups. I can say that having had cancer was a benefit - when the people I was with were panicking in the bomb shelters we were running to sometimes 3 or 4 times a day, I was cool as a cucumber. Not so much when I tripped on a hike and ended up in the ER for the first time in my life where none of the doctors seemed to speak English, but that's another story!"

I will look into that, and share it with some folks I know who have also had a diagnosis while in their 20's.  I would like to think they are professional and know what they are doing with the outdoorsmanship!  That is intense with the situation in Israel.  I had a cousin who was there with his fiancée during some of the bombing, but what I heard on the radio with reports was what really alarmed me.  Any communication is better than no communication with such scenarios, I think.    I myself have gotten into computer science but have helped out by teaching horn lessons to some folks who needed help.  I was a music major when I got the diagnosis, but need some job security and am interested in seeing if I could ever get into computational biology or bioinformatics to do some research at some point.  That being said, there is a lot else that goes into the treatment for cancer besides just the medicine.  I think I have definitely become a much more open individual and am not so afraid to speak my mind about things.    I think that is one thing about my cancer treatment that I actually enjoyed; the doctors and I just looked at it very objectively and tried to learn as much about the situation as possible and act with the best interests of everyone involved.   I think I try to live like that now, and I think I am living a more fulfilling life because of it."

But one thing I've learned,  the heart never limits itself to loving only blood.  You seem like you've a heart to fit a hundred,  and whomever and whatever fills it will be lucky.    Best of luck,  truly.  Be well!"

The shittiest people in the world when you're going through cancer are people in their early 20s. The. Shittiest. It's not because they're shitty people at their core - it's because few have had to deal with something like cancer among someone their own age, and few have the emotional maturity to recognize that it's not all about them. Right now, it's all about you. Stop it. Right this second.  Have you talked to your husband about how you feel? Just because he's sick doesn't mean that he's impotent. And while you certainly should not have sympathy sex with him, you owe it to him to talk it out and to try to find something that works.   You've ""done your duty?""

I had to break up with my girlfriend (she's 20) while I've been fighting off cancer.. her selfishness was just getting too stressful for me to deal with at the same time. Example: During a hospital stay I got a ton of bad news (chemo not working, tumors in lungs tripled, possibly spread to brain, huge blood clot), and meanwhile she was bitching at me that I wasn't texting her enough. Never did bother to visit me in the hospital or accompany me to any chemo treatments though. Hm."
cancer,31xpir,ofthewandandthemoon,11,Thu Apr 9 19:55:40 2015 UTC,"You are being selfish, so your feeling of being selfish is normal. It's not necessarily a knock, but then again it is. If you sign up for marriage, you sign up for all of what comes with it. If you want out, then you weren't prepared for it and should consider not doing so again so abruptly.   I proposed to my then 26 year old wife and the day afterwards, I found out she had ovarian cancer. I fought it with her twice over two years and it was absolutely painful to go through. I wasn't prepared for it, and inevitably I lost her to her third bout 10 months ago. It sucks to take care of them, it was - and is - absolutely the hardest thing I've ever lived through... and I wouldn't have traded it for anything, except to have her back.  You're still young and I totally get your frustration...I really do. Cancer is absolutely horrible. But seriously, if you're overwhelmed because your husband wants to have sex with you and you have to sacrifice things to take care of them, you aren't ready for marriage. Stick to dating until you truly understand what 'work' goes into a marriage."

cancer,31xpir,hoover,10,Thu Apr 9 01:14:35 2015 UTC,"Let me first start off by saying this: Your feelings and needs and wants do matter.  They don't stop mattering unless you allow them to.  A cancer diagnosis does not only belong to the patient, it belongs to their loved ones.  It rattles the people around them and they have a right to their own needs.  They don't suddenly get pushed aside because, ""Well he's the one with cancer.""  Yes, it does put more focus on that person, but no one should make you feel as if you are now to be trumped by it.   I love my husband and want to make it work.   Are you sure?  The way you have described everything in your post is very aggressive and you seem pretty confident in wanting to end the marriage.  I can understand why—you feel trapped in all of this responsibility you didn't know you were signing up for beforehand.  Regardless of other peoples' thoughts on what marriage may or may not mean, the reality of your situation is that you are not okay with your current state of affairs, and your options are to either figure out how to better them, come to terms with them, or remove yourself from them.  Something I really want to point out to you, though, is that you and your husband very likely have different perspectives on his cancer diagnosis and treatment, and very different perspectives on your sex life.  You seem to see his diagnosis his issue rather than something you're both going through together.  It's not unreasonable to expect that he, like many people, would see this as an issue that belongs to both* of you that you would take on together as partners.  The same thing with your sexual relationship—you think he wants you to be a ""sex kitten""; why do you word it that way?  Does he expect you to be wet and willing at the drop of a hat?  Really, take a second to think that over.  Could it be that he genuinely is trying to connect with you sexually and be intimate with you in order to keep that dynamic of a husband and a wife despite all of the shit that you both are now having to deal with?  Of course he gets all sad and mopey, the woman he loves doesn't want to have sex with him.  It's a form of rejection, and it sounds like it's a completely un-discussed form of rejection.  It makes us devalue ourselves and the strength of our relationship, and it sounds like that isn't a very far off assumption to make, either.  Disorder in the sexual compatibility of marriage is a big issue, and I can't fault the guy for wanting to fuck or make love to his wife unless it truly is dismissive of you and based around selfishness.  Why are you uninterested in sex?  Have you talked to him about why?  Have you even had this discussion about your wants and needs?  How long have you both known each other before marriage?  Was this an arranged marriage?  Were you in love beforehand?  Did you even date?  I mean, forgive me, but your disinterest and bitterness sounds like you were paired up with this person against your will, unless the dredgery of his treatment and being all of these different roles for him has just washed away all fondness for what you two had before he was diagnosed.  I can understand that, too.  Look, you're not selfish for feeling how you feel.  You have a right to your emotions and a right to be in a situation that makes you happy.  If divorce will better your life, that's what you should do.  But it would seriously do you and your husband a lot of good to talk about this.  ALL of this.  Stop for a second and really think over whether your judgments of your husband are fair.  The sex thing aside, you mention his missing your shower or almost missing the wedding and spending the honeymoon in the hospital—assuming this was because of sickness and appointments leading up to his diagnosis, these are clearly things he does not control.  I mean, throwing the sleep apnea thing in there, too... stop looking for reasons to bail and just talk to the man.  If he blows up or guilts you because of his diagnosis, maybe there's no reconciliation to be had and you should go your separate ways.  But maybe, at the very least you can come away from this marriage with a sense of mutual understanding.  In the end, you owe your life to yourself and no one else.  It's also not fair to hold someone accountable for a medical concern outside of their control.  Talk and get couples'/individual counseling, or get a divorce.  If you want out and are uninterested in the first option, you shouldn't even waste your time bothering."
cancer,31xpir,charolastra00,3,Thu Apr 9 01:31:55 2015 UTC,Wonderful comment; asking all the right questions.
cancer,31xpir,lucky_ducker,5,Thu Apr 9 03:04:50 2015 UTC,Nicely put. I really admire this post.
cancer,31xpir,Rampaging_Elk,4,Thu Apr 9 08:20:45 2015 UTC,"I have been totally honest and up front with my husband about all my feelings, yet I still go with him to all his treatments and appointments, make all his appointments, write every check for every bill, fight every battle with the insurance companies, fill his med boxes, administer meds, help him with side effects, etc and every other menial task. I try to discuss things with him, but he either doesnt respond, gets defensive and/or cries or just says how it'll be okay and Gods gonna take care of us bs. The false beliefs that God would bless us if we ""did the right thing"" and abstain from sex before marriage has really blown up in his face. I know cancer is not his fault, but Im still mad and bitter this happened. We knew each other 2 years prior to dating and then dated and were engaged for 17 months. He and his family are super conservative and we never spent the night together at my house and only slept overnight together twice before marriage; once at a family gathering of mine and once when we went camping (which his parents hated). We had no business getting married without knowing that side and I told him that, but we are best friends and assumed the love would continue into marriage and by default, our sex life. He and his family made me believe doing it ""Gods way"" would solve every problem. And even now... They say a prayer n think its all fixed and my husband is healed. Sadly, its not that simple. We are getting a cpap machine on the 14th and maybe our intimacy will grow once we finally dont have separate beds. I dont want to divorce, but I also dont want to be miserable. Whoever said he deserves better; youre right. I tell him that every day and try to persuade him how divorce would be a favor to him, but he's not having any of it. He said bc he loves me, but I think he just doesnt believe in divorce and doesnt want to be divorced bc its ""wrong"". I am not in therapy, as Ive recently quit my job as a social worker due to the high stress and demands that cancer brings, and no longer have insurance. My husband is on cobra coverage for now.  Im not able to go to the support group meetings due to it being only during the day and Im working another job from home. This is why I came here because I need to talk to someone who doesnt know me. The criticisms dont bother me bc I know they're true. I dont know why Im not attracted to my husband. The first 6 months we dated we made out, I tried to initiate sex, but he turned me down so eventually I stopped trying. Since then any desire is just gone bc it was never a part of our dating life and now just bc we got a piece of paper Im supposed to just flip a switch? He and his family drilled it in how it was ""bad"" and ""wrong"" and now poof! im supposed to just revert?! Maybe I could have if everything else didnt happen. You wont know if its going to work out sexually or living together until you try, but now we're stuck. I dont want a divorce; Id miss my husband immensly... I just want to escape all this and divorce seems like the only way besides suicide. Im mad and bitter. Im depressed. Im sad that all our hapiness and bright expectations died. Im extremely anxious and irritable. I just feel like I need out. If I didnt love my husband and want to honor our vows, I wouldve been gone already."
cancer,31xpir,SarahStarling,4,Thu Apr 9 03:55:24 2015 UTC,"Is his family helping? Can you enlist either set of parents to help more? What about siblings? Mutual friends? A social worker? Or even engaging your husband to do more? Everyone is different, but I didn't have a caretaker and did it all myself while also working full time with a 2 hour commute. Probably shaved a few years off my life and definitely impacted my recovery, but things need to get done. Enlist anyone that you can to help share the load, and that includes your husband.  You need respite. It sounds like since you gave up your job, your life is 24/7 about him. That's not healthy for anyone, but especially not a caregiver. Do you have any time to yourself? Anything you do just for you?  The thing is, you need to take responsibility for the role you played in this mess. YOU agreed to continue a relationship with the stipulation of no sex before marriage - you can't get mad at him for sticking to his principles when you agreed to it. You agreed to get married despite having no idea of your sexual compatibility. You knew about his (and his family's) religious beliefs when you decided to share your life with him. Yes, this is hard and is testing your decisions earlier than expected but you seem to be blaming everyone but yourself for the choices you made. Take ownership of those decisions and revisit why you chose to make them - maybe it will make it easier to adapt when you aren't blaming other people.  Often hospitals offer free caregiver group therapy. My hospital also offered reiki, massage, and acupuncture for caregivers on a sliding scale. Talk to your husband's social worker about options - if he doesn't have one through the hospital, you need to request one."
cancer,31xpir,bookingly,2,Thu Apr 9 05:04:27 2015 UTC,"When my wife of seven years was diagnosed with stage IV cancer, my anxiety levels reached the point where I made an appointment with my own doctor to discuss what I was going through. He prescribed antidepressant and antianxiety medications and they were a godsend.  Please take care of yourself. It will put you in a better headspace to take care of your husband. Things will get better."
cancer,31xpir,bookingly,2,Mon Apr 13 15:45:55 2015 UTC,"If they genuinely believe that doing marriage ""God's Way"" is going to prevent them from having trials, then they are seriously naive.  Look, I'm a religious dude, and believe in God and go to church and everything, and I'm telling you they're wrong. If God only gave bad people cancer, then people would be good more often. So if they're telling you all that BS, screw em.   You're sacrificing a ton. You're working hard and you feel like it's hopeless, but it's really not. Trust me, your life can get sooooo much better with your husband. You can do this. You can get through it and have all of those hopes and dreams. Your happiness and bright expectations aren't dead - they're on hold until you take care of business. Remember that. Have hope. Make plans, talk with your husband about goals and what you want to do when you're both done dealing with all this crap.  I don't think you'd be very happy with yourself if you left. You say that divorce and suicide are the only options, but there's a third option - endure. Just get determined and stubborn and ornery and fight through it, because it does end. And once it ends, you won't be sure it was worth it. I wasn't. But I'm 7 years past that point, and life is soooo incredibly glorious. It's worth fighting for.   There are clearly some really tough problems with your life right now, and not necessarily through any fault of your own. It just sucks sometimes. I can't help you with the specifics of working through them, but I can tell you they are worth working through. I said it earlier, but it's worth repeating that these are actually some fairly normal newlywed problems. Marriage is a very complex relationship with many facets, and you're going to have to come together and compromise and make it work.   No idea if you're into reading these types of books, but at least looking up information on Love Languages may help quite a lot. Understanding the differences in love languages helps my wife and I interpret each other's actions, wants, and needs. You and he just aren't synced up in that way, but you can be. It just takes work.  Good luck, and definitely consider seeking individual and couple's counseling. Having a mediator can help a ton in getting you both to meet in the middle and come together with a loving marriage.   And keep your chin up!"
cancer,31xpir,gothelder,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"I really recommend doing an online support group if and when you're ready.  It's nice to talk to other people in the same situation but not have to show up to meetings and do one more chore/drive to one more place.  I did cancercare.org--the groups are administered by social workers and they have specific ones for young spouse caregivers.  Totally free.  Plus, I could say all of the horrible things I was thinking that no one in my real life could handle, and people there totally got it.  And there was some really good advice and insight offered."
cancer,31xpir,pdmishh,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:12:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, I am sorry about coming across as so harsh with my first comment.  You have quite a predicament.  I think the conservatism can make things a bit more stressful.  Part of what I really enjoyed about my cancer treatment was how analytical the doctor's approach was to the tumor, while being aware and sensitive to the fact I was a young man with feelings and existential thoughts and whatnot.    You seem to be doing A LOT of good stuff, but that can be very hard to sustain; humans have finite energy to expend (just saying, not to criticize, but to say kudos to you and that it must be exhausting doing what you are doing).  If you can, try to just keep trucking.  I believe you said things might be getting to a turning point soon with the treatment.  It can be very hard to communicate with people who can be open to attributing life events to God, because I think people can have subjective thoughts about God that can be hard to reconcile with other people's ideas about the world and what to do in the world and how to do things in the world.    You are in a very challenging position, but you are doing really well.  Keep reaching out to folks (be it on the inter webs or in real life), and take as many moments as you can for yourself when you can amongst all the appointments and work you have to do to make money.  I don't know what else to say.  If you are thinking about suicide, that is a sign that things are really at a critical point.  Again, sorry for what I posted earlier.  Your life has just as much priority as your husbands.  Maybe right now, your husband is very vulnerable, but you are becoming more and more vulnerable as well as you exert so much energy into care-taking for him and working.  Just try to keep at it for a bit longer.    Divorce does seem like a viable option, but see if you can make it through the last round of treatments. If things are getting really crazy, do see if you can speak out to someone.  If you have any friends from growing up, or relatives you feel like you can confide in at all (or any one you think you can talk to about something that is really bothering you), try to reach out.  It is so important to be able to talk things out that are giving us problems, but it can be difficult to find people to talk with sometimes that we feel would take the situation seriously and be able to provide good support for the particular situation (which again your situation is very challenging).   Good luck!!"

cancer,31xpir,SarahStarling,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:59:51 2015 UTC,"For reals! Part of dealing with cancer is just making stuff up as things develop since it's not something people don't typically have to go through (especially at this age).  Unlike high school, this isn't an experience that you can share with 50-500 other kids the same age as you.    I found I like Reddit a lot because I am able to communicate with people much more easily who may have gone through things I can relate with about personal issues I have encountered; it can help make things seem like I'm not the only one in the world going through crazy shit.    If you do need to vent, feel free to post some more or send a PM if you need.  Again, you are in a very difficult situation and I wish you the best of luck!! (Real quick, one site I find that helps me chill is this: http://www.rainymood.com/.

cancer,31xpir,pesyapesya,3,Thu Apr 9 06:15:32 2015 UTC,"And this is why you do not commit to somebody without an intimate knowledge of the life the want to lead. His desire for marital sex should have been something you discovered long before you said ""I do"". I better stop now before I say something really mean and whatnot."
cancer,31xpir,pesyapesya,2,Thu Apr 9 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"I understand that your angry and it's causing a ton of distraught emotions. It's sucks to have to deal with an issue like this after just getting married but if you think you're ""too young"" to go through something like this then grow the fuck up fast. You cannot let your anger with life's wild cards influence your decisions with your husband. It's completely unwise to think about divorce just because you're struggling with your husbands cancer diagnosis and relationship. He probably wants to be intimate with you because he feels incredibly lonely and doesn't know how to handle things- he probably feels like a stranger and this is his way of ""rekindling"" things and making things feel normal again. Also stop blaming him for your unhappiness- the only thing making you unhappy is yourself. You marriage is only as dysfunctional as you make it at a time like this, especially when your husbands vulnerability is at an all time high. It's completely unfair for you to make the calls in your relationship at the moment when it's probably the last thing your husbands wants to think about while his life is as risk. Im sorry for your misery, but that's 100% on you."
cancer,31xpir,bookingly,2,Thu Apr 9 04:44:50 2015 UTC,"OP, after dating for 6 months, you stopped trying to initiate sex, and it just stayed that way? I understand if he wanted to wait until marriage, granted I like to test drive a car before I buy it, but he had his beliefs. No wonder he wants sex so much - the guy has cancer, and he hasn't fucked his wife very much (from what I gather, and sorry about the crude language). My question is this: why don't you want sex? Is it because he's ill? Or are you attracted to someone else? Perhaps instead of shooting down his advances, you could accept or even initiate. The next statement is not for the faint of heart, and may or may not apply to the situation. If he can't lay pipe well, you should teach him or show him some ... tutorials ... and how it's done. Then practice.   I know it's stressful taking care of him, but he NEEDS you. He's your best friend right? Be there for him in his worst and elevate him. But he needs to understand that he needs to elevate you as well, even if he is feeling terrible.   Best wishes OP, I think you two can beat cancer and have a flourishing marriage."

Yeah, I may not have been the patient, but I kicked cancer's motherfucking ASS.  I kept two people, two animals, and some houseplants alive on almost zero sleep.  I am amazing.

I don't know how much advice I can give you, it sounds like a fairly complicated situation that you're in. When you're dealing with overly-religious people, it gets to be very difficult to talk to them, and try to convince them otherwise, whatever otherwise means. They're pretty set in their ways, and it's difficult to have them see facts for what they are. You guys both sound like nice enough people. I hope you guys work it out. Eventually, he will probably either see the light and you guys will work it out, or he'll see the light, and you'll split. A lot of things are just a matter of time, and wait and see. You might not be able to do much more aside from that right now, just for the time being. Hang on, as much as you can. Remember how selfish and terrible it is to just leave your family (you mentioned suicide). Imagine what it would feel like if someone close to you did it. Don't do it to them. It's so difficult for me to keep going myself. But I know how my family would take it. So I must carry on, whatever that means. Good luck!"

Steroids made me a emotional disaster, that and I was not able to get good sleep. I also found I had mild ADHD, had to have everything clean and in order.  Chemo brain is a real thing, I have also had to manage neuropathy of my legs.  Everything has been manageable and I did it mostly by myself."

On the flip side I have packed on the pounds at the end and am a round 205.  I forgot about that I am just finished after two year. Tomorrow is 21 days post chemo.  I did 21 rounds of 21 day cycles, year two make sure you ditch the Hickman line for the port.  Oh ya I hated my Hickman line, it was a blessing and I was lucky to have zero problems with it but it still sucked.  I also was not a big fan of the low hemoglobin, at 75 I was given a transfusion."

cancer,31tbnn,NikkiP0P,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:56:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the summons!  I think /u/spicedmeats hit the nail on the head - if people continue to have a good performance status and their cancer is not progressing, they would be considered for platinum based consolidation chemotherapy (and would usually get it). Having said that, the evidence to do so is underwhelming so it may be omitted if they aren't doing very well."
cancer,31tbnn,beamseyeview,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:35:55 2015 UTC,"Carbo/taxol administered with radiation is given at a lower radiosensitizing dose (makes the local effect of radiation more potent but NOT a systemic dose)- it is standardly followed by a higher consolidation dose of carbo/taxol. The rationale is the predominant and potentially more meaningful area of cancer recurrence in locally advanced NSCLC is distant so you need to receive a systemic dose to address the potential cancer cells sitting distantly.  There have however been no phase III trials comparing radiation+carbo/taxol with and without consolidation chemotherapy thus the likely hesitance in saying anything definitively. There have been negative trials with other chemotherapy agents, doses given with radiation as a consolidation treatment.   Hope this helps let me know if you have other questions. (and caveat that this is not actual medical advice etc etc and i'm a radiation oncology resident)"

If it doesn't stop or a lot of blood comes out, you should probably head to the hospital. Leaning forward will help it come out your nose and not into your stomach making you sick. And I think pinching the bridge of your nose will help form a clot.   I did wake up one morning with blood coming out from around my PICC line, that scared me a little."
cancer,31qke3,wickedosity,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:51:46 2015 UTC,I was on blood thinners during chemo too. I use to get really bad nosebleeds but mostly after showers. They would just stop on their own. Not sure how to prevent them in your sleep though.

cancer,31qke3,skitzafit,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"Hello Im not a patient but I came here because my mother was just diagnosed with cancer. Maybe I can give some help here though.  When I was a kid, I would get nosebleeds at boy scout summer camp nearly every day. This was likely due to allergies. One day it was fairly drawn out and wouldn't stop, so they sent me to the camp nurse/ first aid area.   The nurse there had me try all the usual tricks but nothing was working. As a last resort they took a small cloth, folded it up so it would fit between my upper lip and my teeth, and soaked it in cold water before applying it to that location (and refreshing as needed).  It worked. Their reasoning was that major blood vessels that supply to the nasal area (the ones bleeding) run right past that spot and the cooling effect helped to coagulate the blood. I have used this trick twice in the last 20 years and it has worked each time. I'm not sure if any of that is true, but it worked. Looks like another comment here also recommended a similar 'cool the area' treatment.  Hope that helps."

cancer,31r8g9,Reddheadd13,6,Tue Apr 7 15:19:18 2015 UTC,"She needs to feel what comes naturally to her - sadness and despair are pretty natural. Be there, be a distraction, be the light that she needs in her life, even if she's not seeing it now. But let her feel her own pain in her own way. If the chemo takes, she may start to feel more positively, and you can nurture that. For now, if she's negative about it, don't try to talk her into being otherwise - anger goes a long, long way toward fighting. I was nothing but pissed off through the surgery and treatment, the waiting and scanning, because that was how I needed to be. I would never underestimate the value of feeling what comes naturally."
cancer,31r8g9,131i,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:35:56 2015 UTC,"I know you mean well, but positivity doesn't cure cancer. Chemo, radiation, and all the miracles of modern day science do. Sure, you can be the fife and drum corps of your treatment, but when did that ever win a war?  She has to feel what she's feeling. I didn't feel positive, but felt forced to sugarcoat everything and put on a ridiculously bouncy, cheerful disposition because of how I internalized the concept that positivity would help me survive (and, in contrast, that the depression that was simmering under the surface would kill me faster).   How those around me were most helpful was by physically doing things for me - cooking, cleaning, helping me shop, bringing me trashy magazines to read because my attention span wasn't long enough for my normal stuff (I could tell you EVERYTHING about the Kardashians), or finding me fun, light movies or tv shows to watch. Whenever I started watching a show, I had a friend who would read the spoilers to find out if there was any cancer plot anywhere because she knew that I couldn't handle it. I appreciate that more than she will ever know.   How is she with technology? My 85 year old grandparents LOVE their Roku and watch a whole lot of Netflix - especially my grandfather who has some health challenges and can't stay awake. Someone introduced me to Star Trek: TNG when I was sick and told me it wouldn't matter if I fell asleep halfway through because I wouldn't miss huge plotlines. I paid it forward and my skeptical grandfather LOVES it. It's also given us the opportunity to get to know each other in a different capacity - and one that has nothing to do with illness. :)"

Talk to your mortgage lender for leniency BEFORE you start getting late on payments.  Ask friends and family for support with your children.  Cry as much as you need to after you do that.

This disease, which killed my mother over a decade ago, is still one of the most intractable cancers.  The timeline sounds about right to me.  My mother, who was 20 years older than your wife, lasted about 10 months.  She maintained a good quality of life up until the last couple months or so.  Take comfort in the knowledge that, although this disease is almost surely fatal, it is not usually very painful or uncomfortable to the patient.  It's tough to give advice about money without completely dissecting your financial life.  In terms of insurance, why not just go buy some on the open market?  It will be fairly cheap - you can't be denied or charged extra for a preexisting condition these days (assuming you're in the US).  One thing to bear in mind about the money, though: it's not all about your wife.  To be blunt, she'll likely be gone soon, and you still have to raise your kids.  Do you want to do that without a house, for example?  So keep your financial wits about you.  One thing I'd do is involve as many friends, neighbors, and family members as possible.  It will be invaluable to have help around the house, and on-call babysitters.  There will be a lot of trips to the doctor and hospital.  I don't know exactly what kind of work you do, but working from home seems to me like a better situation than working in an separate office.

They also will be able to point you in the right direction for emotional support for you, your wife, and your children.  Now is not the time for shame. Start a GoFundMe account or something similar. Tell everyone you know. Ask for money. Ask them to share with their friends, family, and coworkers. Do it now.

The joy is from someone being happy and supportive of what I've said. If only something imaginary could have same effect... And as for a smile well they have been plenty as I've been able to see way beyond my diagnosis.  Having a sense of humour is vital to help getting rid of a tumour."
cancer,31o9uf,MrsClaypool,-3,Tue Apr 7 06:13:44 2015 UTC,How exactly would prayers help you? And What specifically are you expecting to get from this sub reddit from an account which is 6 hours old?
cancer,31o9uf,glass_bottles,4,Mon Apr 6 22:49:10 2015 UTC,"well that seems unnecessarily hostile.  Unless OP (that would be you, /u/anniexoxo1)edited the post, they're just asking for emotional/spiritual support.    It's one thing to personally not believe this would help, but to go on the offensive like this...  it seems you have a bone to pick with religion.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure this is an appropriate place for you to do so.  There are plenty of other subreddits dedicated to debating the existence (or lack of) religion.  This is not one of them.  Everyone here is struggling to cope one way or another.  Whether it's asking for prayers, positive thoughts, good vibes, etc., in the end, it's the fact that somewhere out there, someone is thinking of you and wishing you the best.   OP: Cancer is a bitch (excuse my language).  I'll be rooting for your father."
cancer,31o9uf,MrsClaypool,2,Wed Apr 8 07:01:37 2015 UTC,Thank you so so much. It means the world to me. ❤️
cancer,31o9uf,glass_bottles,0,Mon Apr 13 19:43:12 2015 UTC,"If you read what Op posted they were asking for prayers, not emotional support. With no context or detail from an account which was six hours old? Ask the mods about people coming on here and hoaxing, so excuse me for being sceptical. I looked at her only other post which was asking for donations.  In what way is asking how a prayer will make a difference to her situation hostile? Perhaps you may be able to enlighten me on that and the difference it makes to people with cancer. Nobody seem to want to answer that."
cancer,31o9uf,ikidu,2,Wed Apr 8 12:55:18 2015 UTC,"To others, the two may be more linked together than you'd think :)  as for the hoaxing: 1.  It was posted in /r/misc .  A good indicator of OP being new to the reddit community, as you and I probably both know there are better subreddits for it. 2.  Go to the fundraising website, and read through the comments.  You'll notice there are more or less two waves of donations, one way back in the end of January, and one more recent in April.  The first wave is very likely to be when the fundraiser was just made, and if you read the comments, they are more or less personally addressing Greg (whoever they may be).  If this is a hoax, they are putting a lot of effort into it.  The fact that a majority of the donations come with personal well wishes, with many of them being religion-centered HIGHLY suggests that this was shared among friends and family that attend the same Church, place of worship, etc.    Is it not reasonable to a) start a fundraising site so friends and family can help out with increasing medical costs and b) months later,  make a reddit account, and ask for support after receiving such a drastic prognosis?  Not to mention after OPs first post in /r/misc , she was chastised for posting the link.  Afterwards, she came here and just posted asking for non-monetary support, in the form of prayer.  Which doesn't cost anyone anything, unless they volunteer some of their time.  Nobody is hurt.  She didn't even mention prayers to what.  Flying Spaghetti Monster?  Allah? Who knows!  To whatever diety you believe in would be the safest assumption.  No harm was intended.    Lastly, you're technically right, it's true.  A simple query for further knowledge, in itself isn't hostile.  However, look at your other posts in this thread.  Have someone else read them.  Are they supportive?  Are they about cancer, or are they debating faith?  I look at the comments, look at the topic of the post, then check which subreddit I'm in and I'm reminded of guests making a scene fighting at a wedding.  You might be right.  In fact, I'm more inclined to lean towards your beliefs than OPs.  But there's a time and a place. /r/atheism . /r/Christianity . /r/islam .  youtube comment sections.  Not here.  This was...distasteful."

Why wouldn't I love it if others talked to him about me and asked for him to keep me in his loving arms?   I know you don't believe all this. But OP wasn't forcing believes on anyone. If you can't give them prayers because you don't believe it helps, that's ok. But to react the way you did seems harsh to me."

You're an insensitive individual that obviously had no experience in sickness whatsoever. Cancer is the Emperor of all maladies it's the second killer and women in the United States. yes sometimes when Cancer gets so bad and they're going through so much pain there isn't much that we can do as people other than to pray. I'm praying for this family I'm praying for the best I'm praying for them to find a beacon of hope to comfort them to guide them through this hard time for the one that they love. and I appreciate it you don't believe in anything at least send good vibes toward this good family. or get off this reddit. We don't need people like you in our world.

You don't need a god (or Allah not making any assumptions) to get a sense of peace or to make it through the worst times. Tell me why kids get cancer (or any of us) since your omnipotent God would clearly allow it and why praying to your God to cure them and letting them die is beyond fucked up on so many levels?"
cancer,31o9uf,MrsClaypool,-1,Tue Apr 7 00:10:58 2015 UTC,I'm not staying my god is making things grow back or is curing the sick. I'm saying it's all about what you believe in. I don't really care what you believe in and I've tried helping you. You don't seem to want to have a discussion it seems like you just want to argue and I don't want to argue I have no problem discussing and trying to help you but you just seem like a such a bitter and negative person. & I could be wrong. But I really would like to stop talking to you. go on to one of those other reddits where you can troll.
cancer,31o9uf,knowone91,-1,Tue Apr 7 00:16:49 2015 UTC,Why be so patronising? And as for being angry is when people like you give false hope with 'prayer'. As for being negative and unsympathetic click on my user name have a scroll through my posts and tell me I know nothing about sickness and ill health or being able to send good vibes to people.

Looking for beacons of hope. it's more than just God, it's you and what you believe! if you belive in yourself and the fact that you'll get better you will. if you want to survive then act like it! this is more than just the power of prayer this is the power of humanity that our God has given us.

Enjoy whatever time you have with loved ones and make the best of it."
cancer,31o9uf,ahhh_ennui,-1,Tue Apr 7 00:36:17 2015 UTC,"Oh that explains everything. Cancer been around since Egyptian times as the first recorded they used to burn the Cancer tumors with iron rods. It is always been uncurable. based on what stage you have the more severe your prognosis can be. Basically how long you have to live. one chemotherapy treatment for example adriamycin, distributed in a Cancer Center is $14,000. xeloda is $25,000, Herceptin is ranging around 10000. not to mention the oncologist appointments, the blood work, the extra assistance at home, the anti nausea meds, the pain meds, all the medicines that you take on top of what the cancer has damaged or the chemo. My point is that cancer makes quite a profit for the medical field. as much as I trust in the doctors and nurses and administration and scientists. I do believe that there will be no cure. there's too much of a money market for the cure and the treatment. Also it's down to nuclear science, with genomes we're finding out now that chromosomes are now being mutated causing the different types of cancers whether its environmental or if it genetic. It's our DNA that is creating this malady within us. You have two options when you are diagnosed and you can only choose one. Fight like hell, while doing your research. Or two, lay your head back on the pillow and let it consume you. As I will quote Siddhartha ' it truly is the Emperor of all maladies'  Just in case you didn't know this already."

I get the history of cancer, I get your personal views on it and I get your golden advice on how to deal with it, no seriously thanks.  Since diagnosis I've never been more positive about what I can do to to help myself, I'm also realistic that this will kill me and I'm actually ok with that, i live my life without fear and realism and enjoy every day that I have. Maybe you ought to take a step back and reevaluate how you treat people."
cancer,31o9uf,ahhh_ennui,0,Tue Apr 7 01:09:30 2015 UTC,"Whether it prayer, sound advice or just a freaking pat on the back.. People seek comfort in trying times and reserve the right to ask for it in a way that makes sense to them. I lost my wife just over 4 months ago the exact same thing you're going through now. I feel for you, I really do. And whether you like it or not, I'm going to pray for you. It may not do anything. I don't for a second think my words hold sway over the great cosmic force some understand as God and others as complex thermodynamics. There's a lot I don't know (and even more I wish I didn't) but I'll tell you this... I've no right to question how someone seeks comfort in such a trying time. Neither do you. Don't let this cancer poison your heart. Love for others is all you'll have left. Don't lose it."
cancer,31o9uf,MrsClaypool,0,Tue Apr 7 01:46:58 2015 UTC,"Just going to unpack what you said, but first my sincere and genuine empathy at what you have gone through in losing your wife, this is no doubt can be seen as a horrible disease and being on the other side I can envisage what my wife, 4 children family and friends will feel at me dying, a sigh of relief probably!  And I'm sure you really feel for me given all that but praying for me is actually making you to feel better and to believe  you've actually done something. As for a cosmic force that some understand to be God well good luck with that and as for 'complex thermodynamics' I'm not sure you understand what that actually means in cosmological terms as it is nonsensical.  As for no right to say about where someone seeks comfort, how would feel if someone in the same situation was told or was investing their time and energy that sacrificing a chicken, put their belief in homeopathy or getting a shaman to wave feathers over them? Or go to be told to go to a alt med clinic that has the modern day equivalent of snake oil salesmen peddling lies? You believe that someone hasn't a right to say it because it's 'comforting'? You see that for me is the equivalent of you praying for me. How about respecting my disbelief in your religion and the false hope it engenders?  Cancer has not poisoned my heart in fact it's allowed me to experience life in a way that is enhanced and focussed, it's enabled me to catch up and see friends from around the world and have quality time with my family. So I would contend that I have way more than 'love is all I have left'.  I've been told by a few 'Christian' friends that I'm going to hell if I don't accept Jesus before I die, that my cancer is a result of my sins and atheism. Your praying is the other end of the spectrum which is just as patronising and unwelcome. All the best."

It will be challenging and will be a very anxious time for you and your family.  Quitting smoking for a few years does very little do decrease your risk of cancer after a lifetime.

No matter what, this is her situation and she is in charge of how you and others interact with her for as long as she can advocate for herself.    If she's cool with it, go ahead and tell any volunteer to their face that you do not wish to have company by non-staff.  There is no line you have to tiptoe around.  You said it yourself in your post, you don't want these people sucking up whatever time you have left with your mother.  Although, the muslim joke is hilarious.  If fucking with these people might cheer your mom up, then don't hold back on that either.  If anything has the potential to be a source of entertainment or laughter for her, take it.  Besides that, hang a sign on the door and sternly tell people no guests.  And if they're insistent, tell them you'll call security."

Want pie Dad? Soup? Brownies? There are Mom/Dad/ Grandparent memory books. Get one. Ask him the questions and fill it out. It will keep his mind off the pain and treatment. It will keep you busy and thinking about his stories instead of how he looks and feels now. Keep it (memory book) for your future kids or your nieces or nephews.  Keep busy. Ask your mom how you can help. Rake leaves. Take trash to the dump. Sweep the garage.  What chores who your Dad love to do but can't? Do it. Then humbly tell him it's done. He'll nod. He may not say Thank you. It's ok.  Ask your mom how she is holding up. Listen to her without interrupting. It's not about you. Listen with your whole heart. Don't give her any advice. The only thing you should respond with is ""I love you Mom and I'll help however I can."" Then listen some more.  Ask your Dad how he wants his funeral or celebration of life to be. Write it down.  Don't stress if it doesn't go as he asked after he's gone. The funeral is not for those who passed, it's for the living. He should be asked though and his wishes honored within reason.    Last, tell him you love him and that he was a great Dad.   Good luck."

I know that sounds crazy but it's true. keep that shine in your eyes and your head up. if your dad is important to you and you want him to live then act like it. I know that's a very strange thing to say. when my mom was diagnosed with cancer back in 1994, I kept her alive stage 4 until June 2014. So my best advice is to demand the best care possible. You will not have any regrets. you will not go crazy, you'll feel like it, but remember everything that you do it's helping him, keeping him alive. be a beacon of light. you can do this."

He got diagnosed last year in June. Back then the doctors couldn't tell us anything how long he will last or if it can be cured or anything. They just said he will probably need chemo for the rest of his life which can be anything from one year to fifteen. But things just got worse and worse. The hardest thing is just seeing him every second week or so and everytime he looks more like a skeleton. It just terrifies you. But I'll keep my hope up. Do the things he can do with him and try to be a comfort for my mom. Thank you!"

cancer,31kg2r,shutupmeag,3,Sun Apr 5 23:11:58 2015 UTC,"Follow your pre-surgery directions absolutely. Particularly important not to eat/drink anything when they tell you not to.  The two hours will fly by. During that time they'll be prepping you and you'll have a little time with your family right before. There's a lot to be done. You'll meet some nurses, the anesthesiologist, your surgeon and her or his next in line. You'll go over paperwork  - loads of health questions. They'll get your IV going, get you dressed/undressed, get you a heated blanket and probably some compression socks. You'll have a heart rate monitor clipped on your finger and a blood pressure cuff but nothing weird while you're conscious. They'll have to draw blood but they'll probably use your IV so you don't get poked excessively. No biggy.  Don't be nervous. Generally, even though they're busy, these are the nicest, most attentive people you'll interact with during your stay.   When you wake up, you'll be in a recovery room, probably with a bunch of other people. You'll be monitored very closely as you come down from anesthesia and you'll probably feel not too great. The drug combination given during surgery is meant to make you incapable of moving and can have adverse effects on your blood pressure. In bigger hospitals, every patient has their own full time recovery nurse.   Sometimes you shake (can be severe) and it's scary if you're not expecting it but fairly normal. It's friggin' COLD in the operating room. That and your body is all out of whack from the drugs. It doesn't take long to recover and you'll probably be in and out of consciousness for a little while during this period.  Later...  Now, I don't know about your specific surgery but my guess is you'll be intubated - I can't imagine how they'd do it without. That means you'll have breathing tubes down your throat. You won't know anything about it - it all happens after you're anesthetized and before you wake up. But, it makes your throat a little sore - not terribly.   I'm guessing you'll be more sore than most around the neck area for obvious reasons - that's the site of your surgery. But you'll get adequate pain meds.  Normally, you get a breathing exercise/test to prove that you can expand and clear your airways before you leave the hospital. This may not be something you'll do though. It's not too bad anyway.  I doubt you'll be catheterized but if you do it's no big deal - goes in when you're out and comes out easily when it's time. But, even if you don't have a catheter, they're probably going to measure your pee - they just leave a little plastic measuring cup tucked between the seat and the bowl. Just making sure everything is in working order before you go home.  They'll make sure you're up and about.  I have no idea how you'll eat. Probably like always. You normally get to order off a menu. It's usually not great. ;-)   And I can't tell you how it feels to live  without a thyroid. I still have mine. But it does take a surprising amount of time to COMPLETELY recover from having an organ removed and a surprisingly little amount of time to feel alright in general.  Good luck!   PS: OH! Important! If you're taking narcotics afterward for pain, be sure not to forget a stool softener and laxative as prescribed."

Your oncologist probably wouldn't go around dishing out false hope, generally they use more than one study and take into account prognostic factors specific to your case. However not every oncologist is in this for the right reason and I'd be lying if I said I'd never seen someone push chemo on the patients with false reassurances - so if you think this is the case keep seeing your team but also seek a second opinion, just someone to review your case.  As for your sister and ex just drop contact. This is the perfect opportunity to do so in your life. If you have sole custody make sure you write both a living will and a regular one to define custody for your daughters, your wishes should you be unable to make them, and make sure it's prepared correctly and that many people have copies so that it will hold up in a court of law."

Peters III, P.Y. Liu, Rolland J. Barrett II, ...)  The second, in bold, was the reference. I got the impression that my case took my oncologist by surprise. She presented it at a conference she was so giddy. Just everything about it is riding the slimmest margins. Once I started reading the papers I began to think she made an optimistic guess about prognosis because it was an unusual case. Last cycle infusion I was going to ask my local oncologist but didn't get to see him, he had his nurse practitioner in instead. I had a whole list of questions she couldn't answer.  As for my sister, I dropped contact with both of them several years ago. Unfortunately, I physically care for my mother who is still in contact. I love her but she's almost 80 and blurts out whatever enters her mind. We literally moved 3000+ miles to be away from my ex. I had to wait until the youngest was 18. They're both adults. They're still vulnerable. He's a scary guy.  Thanks for having a look, Nikki  Edit: Comment quote on the report: ""FIGO staging for cervical cancer is based upon the clinical stage. Isolated metastases may not necessarily indicate a poor prognosis, as would be expected for advanced stage disease..."" I had clear margins but 80+% stromal invasion, lymph nodes were clear. So in the report, they're trying to determine if this was another primary tumor or metastasis. Since the lymph nodes were clear, they determined hematogenous metastasis. Isn't that ""distant metastasis""? If it is, then how could I be at 65% not 35%? Seems like more than 80% stromal invasion is fairly extensive. It was 3 mm from invading my bladder."
cancer,31ijd3,ikidu,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:34:13 2015 UTC,"Ok so I have the paper in front of me. This one paper (I would never go by one paper) seems to say ditch the FIGO staging in the event of ovarian mets and consider the outcome going solely off the mets. You said you had clear margins, did you have your ovaries removed?   TBH this study is a little confusing to me. From the way I am reading the study it looks like they are discussing the relevance of SCC vs adeno as tissue of origin and outcome rates, but also how to use that in deciding on whether or not to remove the ovaries in pre-menopausal women.   I'm confused because, and again staging is not my area of expertise, but staging in general is a series of ""if, then"" statements. To me If: ovarian mets, then stage IV. I must be missing something though, since they've staged you clinically at Ib2. Possibly this is affecting how you and I interpret this study and what it might mean for you. It would help if I knew if you had your ovaries taken/total hysterectomy in order to get those clear margins.  To answer you directly, clear lymph nodes is still a good thing, and stromal invasion is taken into account in your FIGO staging - in this case it's read as an absolute value rather than a grey area. Not invading bladder is not invading bladder.   To expedite my reply also, if you did have the surgeries I mentioned with clear margins and you are getting chemo and radiation (in may if I recall?) then I don't see why we wouldn't stick with the 65%. If for some reason you did not have those surgeries I will need to dig up some more papers and recruit someone to read them with me. But I'm more than happy to provide my ""this is not my field"" analysis to your own study :-)  P.S. as an aside at the end of the paper is what I found the most relevant to you: “The outcome for patients with ovarian metastasis is very poor, indicating that ovarian metastasis is the prognostic factor in patients with cervical cancer. Additionally, the present study revealed that most of the risk factors, such as histology, FIGO stage, and lymph node involvement, were not significant in patients with ovarian metastasis. Parametrial invasion was only the risk factor in patients with ovarian metastasis. Routes of spread to the ovarian involvement in cervical cancer have been controversial. Wu et al. suggested that lymphatic spread and transtubal implantation might be possible pathways of metastases from cervix to the ovaries [11]. On the other hand, Tabata et al. reported that ovarian metastasis might occur via hematogenous spread of cervical carcinoma [8]. Interestingly, we found that 8 of 9 distant recurrent patients with squamous cell carcinoma showed lymphatic spread. In contrast, 7 of 9 those patients with adenocarcinoma had hematogenous metastasis. Our results suggest that the route of spread to ovarian metastasis from cervical cancer might be different by histological type, while the further study is necessary to draw the conclusion of routes of spread to the ovary.”  Note that earlier in the paper adenocarcinoma also had the better stats and it looks like (I’m stretching for this conclusion) that could be due to the non-lymph spread and with your nodes clear that could be something which excites your doc also. Please do note that the overall outcome is worse with ovarian mets regardless of staging."
cancer,31ijd3,Lilleskygge,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:31:44 2015 UTC,"Staging: because cervical cancer is still a raging disease in all but 1st world countries, staging is based solely on clinical exam. For instance, in my case, a pelvic exam gave an estimate of a tumor 4 cm or less, thus stage 1. Prognostics are based on everything else thus the quandary in my case. It is perfectly legitimate to say that a woman is stage 1 or 2 and still has a poor prognosis because it was later discovered that she had mets to a liver or kidney (both common sites. I got the b2 after the clinical exam but before they found the ovarian tumor.  Adeno vs. Squamous: I think you got the prognosis reversed. Adeno almost always comes out worse in these reports when there is a difference. It's harder to catch in a Pap test, is more difficult to treat, and recurs more frequently.  Surgery: Yes, I had my ovaries removed and that's how we found out I had the mets. Staging doesn't change in cervical cancer because all cervical cancer is staged clinically.  Margins: Yes, the margins were clear but I didn't have lymph mets, I had hematological mets.  Reports: I listed two other reports that say much the same - if you have adenocarcinoma, remove everything because it's more likely to cause trouble and has a worse prognosis.  All of this taken together is what causes me to doubt the 65%. I can imagine being more positive than 35% just because you're an excellent oncologist (and she is), but I can't, for the life of me, figure out how I would vary so far from the statistics.  My actual lab results were fairly straight forward except for that one line that seemed extraneous and non-clinical. As if to say, this is bad, this is bad, this is fine, this is normal, this is bad, glad you removed the ovaries because this is bad, and by the way, this doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be one of the 65% who actually die but I can't tell you why we might feel positive about it.  It was weird. I have not seen any studies to support the statement that mets to an ovary is not as bad as regular stage IV  Edit: I think it's the staging thats got me screwed up. I know that had they found the ovarian tumor before the hysterectomy I'd be stage IV with a 15% 5 year. According to one of the white papers I read, any spread to an ovary gives me about a 35% 5 year. There was a matter of mere days between my diagnosis and the hystrectomy and that's all that kept me in a 1b2 was examining my removed ovary."
cancer,31ijd3,ikidu,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:42:31 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, so for us that would escalate staging, you would be a stage IV because otherwise there would never be a stage IV (you cant palpate ovaries on clinical exam).   I may have misread the article, I can open it back up at work again monday, I was unfortunately trying to fit that in between patients -.-;  Clean margins are always a good prognostic indicator  Right, no lymph mets is a good thing.   I think the staging is what's getting me too, I wish I had asked the radonc over me before I left but I didn't. I can't remember if she has clinic monday (I think she does) if so I will ask her to explain that to me then and then report back. In the meantime, there are studies that show that believing in a good outcome tends to correlate to a slightly better one. Regardless of if the two are related - it can't hurt to go with your doc considering their advanced degrees and whatnot - I'm sure she has some great clinical reasoning!

The chemicals are also pretty acidic, to the degree that prolonged contact with my bedsheets would bleach them when I was going through chemo.

Focus on nutritional food, and if chemo is something that might be happening, find smooth nice food that goes down easy. Yogurt, smoothies, soup (Avocado and oil is handy to sneak in more calories if that becomes a issue), ice cream, and so on.  And other things:   Grocery shopping. Laundry and dishes.  Phone calls can be a issue if they are hard of hearing. Heavy garden work. Cutting the grass and similar can be a bit of a handful.   One thing though, be a bit careful for that you don't help to much either. If it works, instead of doing all the groceries shopping for them, offer a lift, and carry the heavy stuff. Laundry, hang up the bedsheets and towels, and let them do the unmentionables. Dishes, scrub that pan (or throw it in your dishwasher), but don't stop them from rinsing out cups.  The reason for that I mention this is that it is really easy to help so much that people start to be unable to do things they could do before, and that don't do anyone any good. Walking around in the store and carrying home a bread is actually exercise compared to writing down a list and getting it delivered to your kitchen, yet far less straining then having to drive there yourself, and having to haul all the things around on your own.

I still have the neuropathy but it's manageable. I'm sure if I went up to 800-1000mg a day I would be close to pain free, but the side effects would make it hard for me to work: it greatly increases my chemobrain and affects my balance and ability to speak. As with everything in Tumorville it's a balancing act.   My pain doc said that they can go as high as 3600 mg/day, though I probably would not be able to get out of bed.

I forgot to mention in my original post that she is in fact on gabapentin (300mg) and she was taking the maximum dose allowed. However, after her last round of chemo (eribulin) the gabapentin has stopped providing any type of comfort to her. The pain had reached such a stage that we decided to bring her to the ER. They gave her a morphine shot and have decided to up her narcotics (oxycodone)"

The maximum dose is 3.6g per day: 1200mg 3x day (this taken from the Parke-Davis prescribing information for Neurontin.)  Morphine and oxycodone are not a good long term solution because they act relatively quickly and are broken down quickly. I have dilaudid for break-through pain and it doesn't help my neuropathy, nor does the Nucynta ER I take to control my usual pain levels.  If the gabapentin isn't working for her, there are newer medications like Cymbalta which may be useful. I really suggest you see if her hospital has a pain management center so that she can work with an expert. It was transformative for me."

My experience with the nausea was that it never completely went away.  I did feel more relief than ""just take the edge off,"" though.  One of the keys is to stay ahead of the nausea, to take the meds at the first sign of it or to take even if you don't have it yet.    Something that helped me, and I know it sounds silly, was keeping my belly cool.  I walked around with my shirt pulled up showing off my gut for months.    I'm sorry I don't have more.  Hopefully others will see and can help.  May I suggest editing your original post to mention the drug and symptoms.  It's easier to get people's attention with specific requests.

It's more like trying to manage it, rather than completely remove it.  I've found that baths work wonders for helping really bad nausea subside.

It took me years to get to the point where I can talk about it without breaking down.   People who tell you to just be happy the cancer is gone have absolutely no clue. At all. Completely and hopelessly clueless. So.... Ignore them. They can't help you. Find someone who will listen to you and accept that you may have at least a slight case of PTSD. Because you very well do. I didn't really realize it for a while, but I'm pretty confident that I totally did have PTSD.   But I got by. I rarely ever talked about it. I was already kind of awkward socially, but I felt way more awkward for the first several months afterwards. It wasn't until I found friends who never knew me when I had cancer and treated me like a normal person that I started feeling more normal. When I met the woman who eventually became my wife and opened up to her about what I had experienced, it also changed my perspective. She was incredibly supportive and loving. She helped me a ton.   I have a lot of friends now who still don't know I had cancer. I don't hide it, but I don't bring it up unless I feel like it is important. I only open up about it to help others or when I need help, and that only to those who I know will be supportive.   So basically, I guess my advice is that if your friends and family are saying such idiotic and ignorant things, then you either champion the cause and educate them, or you shut them out of that part of your life and find others who will strengthen you in it."

Even when i found out my symptoms resembled those of low-t.  The hardest part however remains keeping up with how people expect you to react.

Listen to what the doctors say and do your best to follow it, but your job isn't to fix this. You can't make this go away, but you can make it better.

Digital rectal exam, PSA (well PSA drawn before a DRE), and then finally biopsy is the currently recommend course.  I think pcri is advocating for MR-guided biopsies vs. the somewhat random biopsies performed now.  MR-guided biopsies do increase the odds of hitting tumor, hitting tumor that is on the anterior (stomach-side) of the prostate, and does decrease the number of necessary biopsies needed to be performed to make the diagnosis.  It also may decrease the number of unnecessary procedures altogether. The downfall, is that you need another doctor involved (a radiologist with expertise in prostate imaging and performing the actual procedure...which is much more limited than urologists), which is why it is currently not recommended as standard of care.  Sure, if you have this available to you, I'd do it.  But its not available everywhere, and it certainly wont meet the volume of procedures performed in the country."

I'm happy that your mother passed in a peaceful manner, and that she did not have to suffer through some of the other things that come when the cancer is further along. I've seen it first hand and I can say that it is far beyond the worst nightmare anyone could have ever dreamt in the history of this planet. I have images in my head that I will never get over, and that will continue to repeat for the rest of my life. Poor pitiful me, I suppose. I'm not the one that has the disease. Good luck with everything. I agree with Direpants, remember it all. Find old photos, home videos, listen to voicemails. Do it while you can, the longer you wait the harder it is. Cherish everything.

cancer,3190r0,ikidu,2,Fri Apr 3 04:46:19 2015 UTC,Does he have colon and liver cancer? Or is it colon with mets to the liver? I have experience with the latter. But you probably would have to wait some time until the initial shock is over to see how much he keeps being up to the task. How easy is it for you to find a new job in a year or two if you keep your current job now? Do you have the option to wait and see and change later if you need to? Or do you have the option to work part time for the new job. As you mentioned that your current job is part time too.
cancer,3190r0,burstabcess,2,Fri Apr 3 07:05:29 2015 UTC,Take cancer out of the equation altogether. If this opportunity came up at any other time what would you do?
cancer,3190r0,smegma_stan,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:34:23 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but you can't take out the most important factor in the whole equation. OP clearly cares for his boss and likes his job. It seems he wouldn't leave if his boss' health was 100%, but if the company goes down if the boss can't manage, then he will not only have lost his job, but passed on a potentially good position. IMO, he should talk to his boss and get his thoughts. Ask him what his plans and goals are. It's probably the last thing he wants to talk about, but life goes on and peoples futures could depend on the boss mans decision to continue or disband his business. It will be a tough talk, but OP has family to take care of and I think it's a genuine concern of his to make sure they are provided for."
cancer,3190r0,burstabcess,2,Fri Apr 3 08:37:02 2015 UTC,"It is certainly a difficult decision. Probably one that he or she needs to make themself. The boss will be in no position to make any contribution to the conversation if he has to deal with the much more important issue of his own mortality and future. I faced a similar situation when my dad was diagnosed. I took over running his business, taking him to appointments, dressing his wounds and near the end feeding and taking him to the toilet. The business was pretty low on the priority list, but we kept it going. More for the staff really. I told all the staff that they were welcome to stay on, but they could certainly look for new jobs, no hard feelings. They all stayed, and that was really nice. We had to close up eventually, but I made sure they all got through Christmas with a job and they all found work easily. I did not burden my dad with the many challenges I faced trying to do his job. He just wanted company and love. Every situation is different, just do what you think is right."
cancer,3198sf,j_lane,14,Fri Apr 3 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, I am so sorry.  If you'd like to put your fiance in touch, please have her send me a note. I've learned a lot about cervical cancer since I was diagnosed in December last year.  It's only 3 months of intense learning but it might feel better for her (or you, to talk to someone who has recently been through a similar situation).  She can still get insurance through the Affordable Care Act (aka Obama care). But even without insurance, she'll get treatment. There isn't any need to be overly concerned about that.   As for getting radiation only, the treatment for cervical cancer is super straight forward and dependent on staging and metastasis. My primary tumor was 4.5 cm and caused similar problems. I didn't have incontinence but I had back pain for the same reason your fiance had incontinence - the tumor was crowding my insides.  There could be good news yet! Hang on!  Cervical cancer staging is a little weird. It happens upon pelvic exam. So her doctor looked at the tumor, guessed about it's size, and appointed a stage based on that alone. Until imaging or surgery, there's no real knowing what's happening in there.  My doctor- one of the best in the country, staged me at 1b upon exam. Once she removed the tumor it was found to be significantly bigger and I had distant metastasis. They don't change the stage. The point being, stage 1 cervical cancer doesn't mean much because they can't tell what's going on until they get some imaging done or go in there and cut shit out.  Tumor size isn't everything. It's all about metastasis.   Man, I want to be positive for you but it all seems cheesy in the face of this disaster. Everyone is different but for me, it helps to break down my time on earth into little palatable segments.  I got super stressed in the car the other day, carrying on about death and disease and mean people - grabbed the visor and slung it around because the sun was on my face. Then I realized the sun was on my face - it's warm outside! My GOD IT'S FINALLY WARM! I put the visor back up front, rolled down the window and admired the mountains - breathed in the wet spring air. You know why? Because there's a 35 to 40% chance I won't have the opportunity to enjoy this all again.   So what. I have cancer. It's still a beautiful, fucking, day. It's up to us how we spend whatever time we have. I will NEVER regret wasting a day with my face in the sun instead of crying about shit I can't change. I should'a been LIVING like this for the past 50 years!  Your fiance? You HAVE A FIANCE! SOMEONE LOVES YOU! And you love someone! What a wonderful thing! What a wonderful, fucking life!  Ugh. I love you too, for what it's worth. If there is anything at all I might be useful for, please, send me a note."

cancer,3198sf,schoofer,3,Fri Apr 3 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"Oh man, my wife and I can relate.    June of 2014 she was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma, stage 3 A.  I think I cried for something like a week straight.  Our life that we had just started was suddenly on hold.  She began 6 months of chemo and we moved in with her folks to be closer to where she receives treatment.  October of 2014, we find a lump in my neck, which turned out to be thyroid cancer.  And so we found ourselves in treatment at the same time.  Her comfort that at least I wasn't sick had shattered and it felt completely overwhelming.  To be honest, it's still very hard to think about.  I'll tell you the same thing I told my wife:  Life is like being on a raft, going down a river.  It has its rapids, it has its calms; it meanders, runs straight, has jutting boulders, and hidden boulders.  We are all on our rafts, trying to make it down the river.  We do our best to paddle and avoid things, but we ultimately don't control the river.  Since we don't control it, the most important thing is who we have on that raft with us.  When you married Molly, you were saying ""there is no one else I'd rather have on my raft than you"" and that will be true even through your journeys with cancer.  You're taking the challenge on together.  My point is, you have each other, focus on that and focus on being supportive of each other.  You've been through hell and back, but she is going to need support from you now, and honestly, you'll be able to understand her feelings better than anyone else in her world.  It sounds fucked up - because it is in a way - but this will bring you even closer.  My wife and I still have moments at night, trying to fall asleep, where we'll say to each other ""you thinking about your cancer?"" Yeah..."" ""Me, too..."" and we understand each other on a completely unspoken level.    I wish you both the best.  My wife and I will hold good thoughts and root for you."
cancer,318wd9,Direpants,3,Thu Apr 2 22:50:10 2015 UTC,"Talk to your advisor at school immediately.   I don't know how some people manage to keep a career or their education going through the absolute worst crap life dishes out but if you're not one of those (and neither am I), don't worry about how it ""looks"". Work every sympathy you can to make this as easy as possible because it's hell. Getting the outside stressors relaxed will help you be a better person for your mom. Doing the best for your mom now will make you feel better about yourself forever.   I think that we make comments like that (""I might fail out altogether""), because we're subconsciously bargaining with a higher power. You know what I mean? Hoping God or whomever/whatever overhears it and says ""oh yeah, I forgot he had a physics final, this can wait until next year"".  I don't know why we're always surprised when death and disease gets all close and intimate with us for the first time. It's not like we didn't expect our loved ones or ourselves to die. But there it is anyway and it's the worst thing any of us faces.  Wow, I am so sorry for your mother. That sounds like an absolutely horrible scenario. On the other hand, I'm super glad she has her family around to ease her through this.  I'm a mom too and my biggest concern in regard to cancer/death, is that my babies (now 21 and 25), are equipped to handle their own lives and that I don't scar them too horribly as I transition from young to old to dead. If your mom is like me, she'll be more comfortable knowing that you've taken care of yourself and that she's left a positive mark on your future.  I know it's really hard to construe that when you're full of angst and sadness but give it a try and see if it doesn't brighten her spirits just a little.   I'm only guessing, of course.  You hang in there. I can't help you take a physics test or I would."

There is no manual for this, no one can tell you how you should grieve, when, or where.   This is a big life changing experience and you're going to handle it at your own pace. Don't let anyone tell you that you're wrong for feeling this way or that, including yourself. And don't rush it.   As for school, talk to your teachers, things like this can be put off until a later date. I'm sure most, if not all, of your teachers will be understanding about what your going through.   That said, be there for your mom. Spend what time you can with her. Make this a little easier on her, but take care of yourself too. If you need a moment to step back and collect yourself, do so. I'm sure she's grieving too and it's not easy on her either.   I'm sorry this is happening, good luck."

Mostly in my experience if your body is in that much trouble you don't have the awareness for fear or pain.   Take some time off, tell the school what's happening, find your friends, punish your liver, whatever it takes.   Living is hard, and your life is about to get harder.

Other companies ""should"" be performing this test soon, for much cheaper than the 4K+ that is offered by Myriad... or at least cause Myriad to drive down their prices.

cancer,31a3x0,billyvnilly,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:20:16 2015 UTC,"Direct testing of your sister is not really the best option.    You are correct that your sisters could inherit a BRCA mutation from their father's side, but without any history of breast or ovarian cancer on that side of the family, that is unlikely.  The reason your mother should be tested first is because that is considered an informative test.  Your mother has cancer, if she has a BRCA mutation, that is the cause of the cancer.  If she does not, then something else is the cause (another gene, multiple genetic factors, environmental factors, etc.)  If your sisters test first and are both negative, then that is considered a non-informative test because either your sisters are negative because your mother is (in which case there is still increased risk for your sisters given the family history) or because they both didn't inherit the BRCA mutation your mother carries (in which case there is about general population level).    I would recommend speaking to a genetic counselor more about this."

That means, by their measure, there was no indication that the tumor had spread beyond the area they identified. There wouldn't be anything for chemo or radiation to do! :) She just needs to be diligent about follow-up and letting her doctor know if anything is out of the ordinary."

Somehow I was able to show I was trustworthy and that he was safe with me as his daughter... strangely I'm not sure anyone else got this experience. I saw my Dad for the first time in my life as he truly was during 2014 which was pretty huge. I guess the best thing he did for me was the night he told me I saved his life. It was the night that my mom could emotionally take no more and my brother could handle no more, but yet, I said okay, don't worry Dad, let's build this weird modified toilet thing (I know that sounds weird) so you can feel safe that you can still move off the wheel chair and have a chance. I don't know, during the last 6 months of his life, he let me be affectionate and he was affectionate back. I was his ally. He let me into his mind and I know he was scared. I guess the best thing he did was let me be his confidante and walk him to the grave. I've never done that with anyone else in my life.

None of us really know how long we have, and we are all going to die.  If you have kids and things go according to plan, you'll have to have difficult conversations with them. They're hopefully going to live longer than both of you. That's life.  Everything will end. Your situation comes with a few more statistics but no guarantees. Everyone who loves someone will lose them somehow, someday. No one likes that part, but we all have to find a way to make the most of the time we've got, to live fully and love recklessly. If this person isn't worth the risk of losing her, that's okay. But just remember that everyone comes with the risk of loss, and someone will also have to take that risk on you.  Good luck choosing!"

It is understandable to be worried about a future with her, but if you love her it is not a question if you should stay or leave. You need to examine yourself and your relationship with her to know that answer. This is just my opinion and opinions will vary but if you love her you stay with her."
cancer,316qpt,deliciousbirdthe3rd,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:52:17 2015 UTC,One way to think through the decision.  Make it in your mind.  Stay with her.  What is the best and worst possible outcome?  How will you feel 10 years from now about your decision in each scenario.  Leave.  What is the best and worst possible outcome?  How will you feel 10 years from now about your decision in each scenario.  Sometimes this helps me think more clearly about what to do.  Edit: grammar.

My highs this week: I had my pre-op eval scheduled as well as my radical hysterectomy + RPLND. My husband has been sweet on me. We've been buying expensive coffee and he's been taking up a lot of time with the children and taking over a bit for me when I'm in the depression funk, despite working full days sometimes. My (real) friends have been really awesome. I've been checked up on often by my good friends.  My low this week: I scheduled my pre-op and hysterectomy + RPLND. I was really hoping to have another baby like before, but I want to reduce my chances of cancer coming back as much as humanly possible. My oldest is starting to get very...screamy and confrontational when he's told he's not gonna get his way. He's wonderful and easy most of the time, but he's gotten into a funk the last couple weeks. I guess he's going through a lot, too. I need to do something special with each of my kids sometime to let them know that I love them very much and care about them still."
cancer,3152y3,alliesouth,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:32:40 2015 UTC,I can only imagine your feeling of loss for having the surgery and losing that possibility of carrying another child yourself. There are so many other options if you decide you want another down the road but for now it sounds like you have your hands full! I think doing something one on one with each of your kids and giving them the opportunity to ask questions of you alone is a great idea.  It sounds like your husband and friends are a great support network and I hope they continue to be throughout your journey.

I actually feel grief and sadness over it. It's making me feel a bit silly, but logically and emotionally I know it's okay. I can't wait to get some one-on-one time with the kids, though. It's important.  Thank you, I think they're amazing too. This journey hopefully will be on the way to a closing soon, knock on wood."

cancer,313use,themomfiles,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:34:34 2015 UTC,"So I don't know the scientific names of what I lost, but it was I think a little of my bicep. Most of it was the muscle on the outside of my arm, though. I also had about 6 inches of my bone removed and replaced, and I did lose a nerve.  I was really lucky with the nerve in that my radial nerve (the one they removed) had branched at my shoulder, and the branch took up the slack when the main nerve was removed. I maintain about 90% functionality, and got it back pretty much immediately after the tumor was removed. However, this was extremely rare.  For the bone, it's mostly growing together. It's in theory stronger, but if it breaks, it will be REALLY bad. It's fascinating to know that if you stick a dead person's bone on the edge of your cut up bone, it'll eventually grow together if you hold it in place long enough with a metal place and some cement.  But the muscle is definitely something I notice. Your body is designed for the muscles to work in concert together. Think about one of your favorite songs, then remove the drums from it, or the vocals. You can get along with the song pretty well, but you're going to regularly hit points with the beat or a particular voice part that you'll miss every time. Kind of like that, but with all kinds of random stuff. Like I went jet skiing, and it turned out to be very difficult, because I kept pulling to one side since my unaffected arm was much stronger. My brain hadn't and still hasn't adjusted to accommodate for that significant change.  I tried some weight lifting, but it still felt really weird. I wasn't a good idea, either, since my bone hadn't grown back together. Doing a pushup now is practically impossible, as I'd have to do it almost exclusively with one arm.  Any questions or anything in particular you're curious about?"
cancer,313use,Rampaging_Elk,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:58:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. How long ago was the bone placed? It's pretty cool what can be done with cadaver bones! What type of work did you do before and can you do it now? I'm 2 months out from surgery and still can barely lift more than a few pounds. Guess I'm just curious how much strength I can expect to get back without it, since everything I've read says it's the maestro to the orchestra, but it might just be a 'wait and see'. I was in a really physical job and I'm still coming to terms with the fact that I won't be able to go back to it."
cancer,313use,Rampaging_Elk,2,Thu Apr 2 03:22:42 2015 UTC,"Bone was replaced a little over 7 years ago. I do IT, so it comes in play when moving servers and stuff. Thankfully, I've always been a big guy, and naturally decently strong for moving things around, so I haven't had too many problems. It happens sometimes.   But if your job required regular moving of heavy things, yeah, I'm guessing it will be hard to go back. Don't worry too much, though. You'll find a way to adjust and keep going.   Thing I've discovered is that the other muscles will pick up the pace a bit, but it isn't ever going to be the same. It isn't like you can just build the muscles back up. When they're removed, there isn't anything to build up. But again, you adjust. For me, I'm just grateful I have my hand still. Not too long ago they would have had to just cut off my arm, and even then I might have died. I personally could take or leave the arm - I just need the hand. And I'm incredibly grateful to have it."

Like /u/NikkiP0P said, range of motion can be one thing that needs work, but those exercises can start pretty much right away. She may have drains that she or a home care nurse cares for in the first few weeks.  As far as cancer surgeries go, a modified radical mastectomy doesn't take any muscles, doesn't enter any body cavities, and usually has limited pain afterwards. I hope both your parents recover well and quickly  This site may be helpful: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/mastectomy/expectations"

cancer,312dcw,NikkiP0P,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"Sure!  So this is a major surgery but how major depends on the type of mastectomy. I don't even know the standard of care for Australia, but sometimes they take varying levels of the tissue under the breast and recovery will depend on how much tissue (muscle!) is taken. She will be able to function after a few days id guess but the soreness and range of motion issues will continue for time to come after that. We usually allow 6 weeks before we start any radiation to allow the site to heal but many of those women still have difficulty getting their arm up over their head for treatment, the best thing you can do to help this is encourage her to do her stretching exercises post surgery.  Hope that helps!"

I can relate to you because my mom has always been a huge positive force in my life, and while she's still alive, the illness has already crippled her and taken her ability to do so many of the things she used to. The biggest difference in our situations is that you had hope of recovery and I've known how my mom's story ends ever since I heard the words ""brain cancer"".   I'm 10 years older than you so I had that much more time with my mom than you have with your dad, but it's never enough. My wife is pregnant too, and we had much the same idea that you did: have the baby in time for your loved one to meet the little one. Of course it's bittersweet. Yeah it will be great if they can meet, and we plan on naming the kid after mom, but he or she will never get to have the relationship and experiences with her that my other kids got to enjoy.   I guess my point is that there are other people with similar experiences who are going through the same sort of thing as you. In that way you are not alone.

cancer,30xx6w,jrsnedegar,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:52:01 2015 UTC,"I never thought I would be on here either.  One of the things I've learned since my father got cancer is how little people who haven't gone through something like it understand what you are actually going through.  My dad was diagnosed with esophageal cancer about 3 years ago.  When he went to have a stint put in to make up for the part of his throat they would have to take out, everything went wrong when it let loose during the night causing several bodily infections and pneumonia.  There wasn't a single doctor or nurse there who thought he would survive but he did.  Now, a few months ago we got a call with the results from one of his tests that he had cancer in his lymph nodes and it was inoperable.  He's back on chemo again, he's taking something new that gives him a 40% percent of adding 8 months to however long he has left, and no on seems to be able to give him a legit estimate.  I had to move back in with my parents just to take care of him.    One of the hardest parts other than all the wounds that he has that can't heal completely is that he had to have something called a j-tube inserted, because his throat actually comes out of the side of his chest because there was no way of connecting it to his stomach after the first attempt didn't work.  I was very angry for a while, I went through all the normal stages.  Now, like you, I find myself just very sad.  There's nothing I can do about losing the man I love the most in this world, and although I don't know how long I have left with him, I know it will only be a few months.  And he's in so much agony all the time, it's living a horror, for all of us.  So, I wrote just to let you know that there are some who really do know how you feel."

Personally, I didn't do specific research on trials and I wouldn't even know where to start. So your platform might be something I'd really have appreciated.   As far as suggestions go: don't make it too patient-centric. I think this should be targeted towards doctors and meet their needs first and foremost. By getting buy-in from one doctor, you can help dozens of patients, whereas the platform being targetet at patients, who normally do not have a medical degree, might at best help one patient at a time."

We have been focusing on getting patients to do the initial login/signup, but have plans to  encouraging them to bring the results and discuss further with doctors as well.

cancer,30xpl4,Livingwithalk,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:15:49 2015 UTC,When clinical trials are for life prolonging treatment then it is most often better to go on clinical trials than commercially available treatment since it adds a line of treatment you can get NOW and maybe not LATER. But of course you take a risk that it might not work. It depends on the phase. It is typically administered directly by and with the oncologist who signs up for a protocol with the pharma company.

The last 3 weeks she was alive she basically had lost all ability to write, read, or think/speak clearly, but the process had begun earlier. She had stage IV pancreatic cancer that had metastasized to the spinal column but they never checked in her brain. My guess was it was a combination of the chemo and pain killers that messed with her to begin with, and then the cancer spread to her brain, causing the real degradation of cognitive functions.  This was the most devastating part of the process after my mother led such a thoughtful life. Try to talk to him and be very patient.

Women's breast lumpectomy specimens were routinely exposed to a prolonged ischemic time. Administration, the chair, an attending, and the DIO ignored reports of the prolonged ischemic time from a front-line worker. Later the UMKC-GME office lied to the ACGME claiming they often documented the ischemic time and that it was always less than 30 minutes, neither of which are true. However, it did prevent the ACGME and Missouri Medical Board from reviewing any patient charts."
cancer,30u7nw,BigRonnieRon,2,Mon Mar 30 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"Talk to your case worker at wherever you go to handle your medicaid. I'm not sure how your state works, but in IL, anything you make over the federal poverty level (~$950ish for an individual), they require you to either pay in or turn in receipts for as what they call ""spend down"". Since I get ~$1500/mo on disability, I have to either pay or come up with receipts for ~$550/mo before IL medicaid will pay for anything. Once I do, however, they pick up the rest.  You might also talk to the social services office at your hospital. They get paid to help you handle stuff like this. Let them do their job. They're better at it than you are.   EDIT: Also, in talking to your social services office, you might get some assistance with whatever NY's program is. In IL, they don't give a shit who actually pays the bill, as long as I'm responsible for $550 of it. I get a receipt from the hospital every month, take it to the Medicaid office, and they write on it how much of that bill I'm responsible for (my spend-down amount less gas and other receipts I turn in each month). Once medicaid believes I'm responsible for that portion of the bill, the hospital happily writes it off, leaving me with 0 financial burden. They happily write off a $300-$500 spend-down to get promptly paid for the $60k in chemo I get every month (that's less than 1% loss for them), and I don't have to come up with $550/month. Medicaid doesn't give a shit either way. It was actually my case worker at medicaid that suggested I set up a deal like that, and the social services lady at the hospital got it all set up for me."

At this point it's an initial review of my case by visual. Can a bone biopsy be done  quickly without much prep and recovery for this type of cancer? They probably will perform one at that time but so far I have not been informed of it.    I have been reading something about the disease on line and it's scary. Surgery is the only option but not 100% cure. I am thinking I should request an amputation if it provides chance of success. I do not want a prolonged process of surgeries. The problem with this is if it occus on my other arm or elsewhere then I am really in a bad place.

From my experience, what tends to go better: potatoes, cold meals rather than hot ones (like just bread and cheese, maybe combined with soup), yoghurt, food that is ""separated"" (for instance: not rice and vegetables and sauce mixed all together but all separated - sometimes I felt like there was too much going on at once when everything was mixed together), carrots, couscous, chicken, bouillon (if that's what it's called in english) and others but that's what I can think of from the top of my head.

cancer,30qcgb,Otogiwarrior,5,Sun Mar 29 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"I am sorry to hear that. We are in a similar situation.   As someone else said, the chemo regimen you are most likely getting is spelled right FOLFOX (the drugs are folinic acid (technically not chemo but it makes one of the other drugs more effective), 5-FU and oxaliplatin). The antibody you are getting is most likely Erbitux (that's the name of the product with Cetuximab being the name of the ingredient).   I was on these before and I must say that it was rough but worth it for me. When I was on this regimen, my cancer treatment still had a curative goal though. It failed as we found out later so I am considered terminal now.   I think that you should discuss this further with your oncologist. Ask him or her everything you want to know: effects and side effects of this treatment, alternatives (other chemo options, etc.) and everything you can think of that you have to know to decide.  After FOLFOX and Erbitux, I was on FOLFIRI (chemo regimen) and Avastin (antibody). I tolerated it much better. I had 12 rounds of FOLFOX and then soon later (when we found that the cancer was back and aggressively so) 12 rounds of FOLFIRI. Now I just get 5-FU and Avastin as a maintenance therapy. This is really worth it for me. I tolerate it relatively well and always have good days in between the chemo rounds (when the strongest side effects are gone).  Without the chemo, I am quite sure that I wouldn't be alive today and for sure I would be in much worse shape. The side effects are unpleasant and I am much weaker than prior to my diagnosis. But it buys me some more time and for the moment what I gain for me is worth what it costs me. But of course this is a very personal decision."
cancer,30qcgb,ikidu,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:41:57 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you need more information before you decide, things like is the chemo working?  If it was me I would see how the rounds go, during this time try to get visibility to what's going on. Are you in a large cancer centre, it sounds like you are not?  So do you have a plan if you stop chemo?  Do you have a plan with chemo?  The question seems to be how long will chemo give you? Personally I would want to fight, and have a plan to spend time with friends and family. Do some travel and just enjoy life, can you do that on chemo?"
cancer,30qcgb,tarlack,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:43:05 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm sorry that you've had to go through so much.  Did you have ulcerative colitis or some other medical/familial cancer risk?  That's very young to have colon cancer, and other members of your family should talk to their doctors about screening if they haven't done so already.  Since the cancer unfortunately can't be cured, the choice is yours whether you want to undergo treatment with chemotherapy or not.  Many people do, because even though the chemo has side effects, it can help to prevent symptoms from the cancer such as pain and help some people live longer.  Your oncologist is the best person to speak to about the pros and cons of further cancer treatment.    You could also consider speaking to a social worker or support group about some of the complex emotions that come with dealing with cancer.  In terms of your question about the stats, you can find information about chemotherapy regimens and how people did with them by looking up the original papers, but be cautioned that the clinical trials probably had few patients just like you.  The references for mFOLFOX 6--which is likely what you're getting--are here, and you can look up the outcomes of the clinical trials, but you can find information about other chemotherapy treatments for metastatic colon cancer on that page too.  As you can see, there are many treatment options which patients may be able to receive."
cancer,30qcgb,Yazars,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:03:40 2015 UTC,"That's a tough call. I was never considered terminal, but fairly early on into my treatment I did have to confront the fact that going through chemo was a decision I had to make. For me, a lot of it kind of came down to a value equation: Is what I get out of chemo worth what I can expect without chemo?   It does sound like you may not have enough information. If you agree with the diagnosis that it's terminal, and you think it's only going to get you an extra month, then yeah, might be best to just decide that you're done dealing with it and enjoy what time you've got left as best as you can. But if you'll get something more out of it, then keep it going.  Is there anything coming up event wise that you'd really like to be around for? One last Christmas, a friend or relative's wedding, the birth of a child, anything like that? Without a goal of what I wanted to live for, it would have been very difficult to not decide to go through chemo.  But again, this is a very personal decision.

cancer,30r0r5,slp50,2,Sun Mar 29 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"hi, I know everyone is different when it comes to chemo but I figured I would share what I am going thru.  I am getting chemo for ovarian cancer.  I had a hysterectomy where everything was removed including the cancer and one lymph node that tested positive.  To ensure all cancer cells are gone, I am doing 6 rounds of ifosfamide (with mensa) and cisplatin.  I get cisplatin and ifosfamide on the first day, then just ifosfamide on days 2-4.  I get anti-nausea meds on day 1 and day 3.  I also get a shot to boost my white blood cells the day after chemo ends.  I have 3 weeks off in between treatments.   I have finished 2 rounds.  So far both rounds affected me the same.  I don't have any nausea but I don't feel great either, just kind of ""eh"".  The chemo does affect my taste buds.  I get really tired a few days after chemo but then my energy does come back.  Constipation is always a problem.  And of course, my hair fell out.  I have no idea if this is helping but this is what I do.  I drink a lot of water.  The oncology nurse banged this into my head.  Drinking a lot of water is important.  So I always have a water bottle with me, even during chemo.  And I drink a lot at home and even during my weeks off.    I eat whenever I can.  During chemo I bring whatever I think will taste good to me.  Cereal, jello, fruit, nuts, peanut butter & jelly, and I usually have an Ensure shake.  I don't eat a lot but just nibble on something the whole time.  At home I just eat a lot of small meals.  During my weeks off, I walk each day.  Not a lot.  Sometimes just for 10 minutes.    Hope your sister feels better."

The first week home sucks becuase i have to give myself neupogen shots and it causes pain. Like all over body pain. I usually take Oxycodone and smoke Marijuana to help with this. The oxy gets rid of the pain, and the weed makes me eat ( i lost 30 pounds so far, in about 4 months) and it helps me fall asleep.

Point him towards Steve Jobs he had the better of the 2 pancreatic cancers and he pissed himself away with these ""alternative treatments"".

They are both dead, he at 47 from a heart attach (untreated, took days to die) and her from what I suspect was cancer (again, untreated) several years later.   However as /u/ttott100 says, they are adults, and it will be hard to convince them. I've seen what cancer can do to you (I've lost too many friends to it) and failing to do everything possible to fight it is a tad bit foolish.

But here's the problem - people don't care about the facts. If your father has decided that medicine is a sham and gerson is truly just there to help him get better, that cancer can be fixed by eating vegetables, then no amount of facts will fix it. And you forcing it on him will likely only damage your relationship.  You still have to try. Sit down with him, talk with him, go into the conversation prepared with research and studies and other YouTube videos and health blogs (since those seem to be what he trusts for some odd reason). Give him everything you've got to make him reconsider this suicidal approach.   If he shuts it all down, then that's his choice. Make your peace with it and accept that the longer he waits, the more likely it will be that this cancer will kill him. Cancer simply cannot be stopped by eating vegetables. The only thing we've found that does stop it is poison (chemo), radiation, and physically cutting it out. Anything short of that will be ineffectual."
cancer,30pkqm,Rampaging_Elk,3,Mon Mar 30 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"Ask your father's doctor (or potentially, a nearby university)  to suggest what they think is the best solution, and for their evidence supporting their choosing it.  By doing this you will have hard evidence (case studies) outlining how the suggested treatment is effective.  Then, ask the same source for their opinion about your father's route, and evidence that supports that route. There will likely be no studies which show results for your father's current choice.  The problem with this is that it can be time consuming.  In the worst case, send me a pm.   The only poor outcome (assuming the above is done honestly)  will be if your father thinks like mine: modern medicine is a sham to get money.  If this is his position, no evidence of this kind can sway him,and I hesitate to offer other advice.   I would also ask your father to define natural.  ""natural""  is a meaningless term.  Cancer is natural.  Nuclear bombs are natural.  Fire is natural.  Maybe take a position in challenging the idea of what natural is, and why that is a nonsensical position.   But no matter what happens, please remember that your father is in complete control of his actions.  It will never be your fault if he does something, even if you suggested it.  If you make a true effort to help him now to make up for your prior bad advice, you should never feel guilty.  There is nothing more you can do to help him, because as I wrote earlier, he is an adult and ultimately has complete control over his actions.  Even if you gave a flawless argument he may not listen, and you can not fault yourself for that.  Also, I feel it is important for you to keep in mind that even when you gave him the bad advice, it was done with good intentions.   I wish you the best.."

Don't try to push him because as someone else said, he is an adult who has every right to make such an important personal decision on his own; instead, show him the alternative (and not the ""naturalists are idiots"" stuff, but coming from people who know better through experience or expertise) argument.

When you are young and a non-smoker or without other risk factors,  there is very little reason for them to suspect a tumor. In fact,  they didn't find the tumor until they noticed his lung was collapsed.   When he got it out, they never did any more scans because it was supposedly benign.  Now,  6 years later he had over 50 small tumors throughout his body.  Again,  though,  there was no way they would have thought that due to the original tumor.  His case is atypical so the doctors had no reason to do a PET before.   It sucks,  but it's just the way it happens sometimes.  Lawsuits can take years to settle and are extremely stressful (I've had family members on both sides).  Unless you feel the doctor was intentionally neglectful for personal gain,  I wouldn't sue.

For example, Paul Kalanithi, a Stanford neurosurgeon (undoubtedly a bright guy and good doctor) didn't realize he had cancer until it was already metastatic.  He was a non-smoker too, and I suggest you read some of the things he's written and what's been written about him.  With symptoms of metastatic disease that already started in October 2013, there's a pretty good chance that it had already spread by July 2013.  Most importantly though, what's happened since March 2014?  A lot happens for somebody over 1 year with metastatic lung cancer.  X-rays are limited in picking up small tumors compared to CT scans, but people try to be careful about ordering too many CT scans in young people since all the radiation an increase risk of future cancers."

And I didn't feel a thing! So scary.   After I was diagnosed, they suggested radiation therapy on my lung...maybe since the tumor was so big, it was really hard on me. Aside from the nausea/vomiting/burning, I coughed up lots of blood and couldn't breathe unless I was lying down on my right side. I lost about twenty pounds in the hospital because I couldn't eat.  My uncle and aunt (both doctors) urged the hospital to give me radiation on my spine too, to hopefully lessen the pain and help me walk again. After I was discharged, I had to use a wheelchair to get around for a few weeks, but I worked at improving my leg strength and now I'm able to walk on my own, completely pain-free too. I owe a lot to my aunt and uncle for that...the hospital didn't want to radiate my spine because of how badly I reacted to having the treatment done on my lung.   My oncologist's initial prognosis was that I'd have six months to live...over a year later and I'm doing great. Occasional shortness of breath, some weird crackling in my bones from the cancer damage, but otherwise no outward signs of disease. I get scans roughly once every two months, and while the tumors aren't shrinking, they're not growing either...so I'm grateful for that.  In the meantime, I've gotten a lot of things crossed off my bucket list: I accompanied my mom on her first trip to Europe, I went to Disneyland (for Cars Land, haha), I got married, I was on ""Wheel of Fortune"", and I'm working on seeing one hockey game in each of the NHL's 30 arenas (I've hit almost half of them this season)!  The next big project on my list is to move out of LA, so hopefully my good-ish health holds out until I can scrape enough money together.

Unfortunately, while this drug might just do that, there is no real evidence to support this assumption..."
cancer,30naeg,adenocarcinoma,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:14:32 2015 UTC,"A few months ago I was in a somewhat similar situation. Not exactly...I was a bit worse off than it sounds like you are, but I'll share my experience anyway.  In June of last year, I finished the list. Every drug approved for my condition (stage 4 rectal), which hadn't been counterindicated by genetic testing, had failed to control my cancer. We made the decision to take a few months off of chemo and talk to some surgeons to see of there was any way of removing my tumors. They'd started big and crazy, but even though the chemo failed, it was successful in shrinking my primary tumor and turning the ones in my liver to mostly scar tissue. We had a plan. It was crazy...they were going to cut out 2' of colon and about 30% of my liver on the first operation, let me recover for 4 months (and let my liver re-grow), then remove another 50% or so of my liver. All told, they were going to remove the entire right lobe and about half of the left lobe. Everything was a go until one last CT scan a couple weeks before surgery, which found new lesions on my lung, so surgery was immediately canceled.  At this point, I was sick, and getting worse every day. My only option at that point (I thought) was experimental drugs, so I signed up. They could have offered me dog shit on a stick, and I would have happily taken it if they told me that they thought there was any chance of it working at all. I was desperate, and I jumped at the first trial that I qualified for, even though I knew (and they kept reminding me) that the therapy had no curative intent. It was just to determine how this new drug affected liver function. It didn't have any curative effect, and for the next 2-3 months, I just got worse.   I finally had to just tell my doctors that I wasn't interested in that shit anymore, and that either they were going to put me back on the failed drugs to try to stabilize, or I was going to find a new doctor that would. I've been back on Folfiri & Vectibix since December. I'm not cured by any stretch of the imagination, and I harbor no delusions that it's going to continue to work long-term, but I don't feel like I'm going to die tomorrow anymore, so that's a great thing.   I just called the research center last week to get back on the list for experimental drugs, but I've got a different outlook on them now. I'm a bit more selfish, I guess. I'm simply not interested in single agent trials anymore. If it doesn't include a base of Folfiri or Folfox (anything with 5fu...love that stuff), I'm not interested. I'm more than happy to try any new add-on drugs they have for conventional therapy, but it's not worth it to me anymore to try anything REALLY crazy. I won't do another that doesn't have curative intent, either.  Like I told the study doctor when I left, I have a high tolerance for cancer-related bullshit. I know I'm going to have to deal with it for the rest of my life. I do, however, require there to be a good day every once in a while, otherwise my tolerance for bullshit plummets. I'm OK with only 1 or 2 good days every couple weeks. If you can give me a 50/50 ratio of good days to bad, I'll sing your praises. If all you give me is bad days, however, I'm not interested in your bullshit.  I don't really know what point I was trying to make with this, other than to get the story off my chest, but I hope it gives you some perspective into some different mindsets that apply to experimental drugs."
cancer,30naeg,zenmoto,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:06:24 2015 UTC,"I'm on biphosphates (Zometa) for a similar reason, namely maintenance of breast cancer that has since spread into my hip. From my reading the worst side effects mostly relate to dentistry that affects the jaw such as tooth extractions.   The experience of receiving the drug has been largely a non-issue. The first two times I received an infusion I got pretty serious bone pain for a day or two afterwards. If I recall correctly (I've been getting the treatment for a few years) we started infusing the drug over a longer period of time and I haven't had a problem since.  Obviously there is at least some element of luck to that.   If you do accept the treatment, make sure you get a full work up from your dentist and deal with any pending issues first, and talk with your oncologist about going off of it before having invasive dental work after. I'm only one data point, but I've not had a problem, and if it keeps you kicking...  There's a fair bit of dice-rolling in our situation, unfortunately. I hope you come up sixes."

I am probably only making this an issue because treatment has been very good to me so far. I used to have serious bone pain in my arm, which completely vanished within the first couple of days of chemo. The worst side effects (apart from a notoriously low white blood cell count - two weeks after chemo I am usually below 1.000) is a strong and persistent headache on chemo days. Since I seem to respond well under this treatment, I am not exactly in a ""nothing to lose"" situation.  On the other hand, I can manage a few more side effects, if there is the slightest chance of helping me in the long run. I managed to do my last chemo (Vinblastine, 6-MP, Prednisone) while still going to school, and I'd say compared to that I am on an afternoon stroll right now.   I'll probably do it. The only real holdup right now is my dental work - my wisdom teeth need to get out before starting and doing that now would mean a further couple of weeks delay in my chemo, the plan was to finish the chemo first, do the dental work once my WBC is alright again and then start it.

I'll answer your questions in reverse but in my experience I would just ask for a male doctor and its likely they will insist you see a male anyway if you explain what it is for.  You won't be naked but you will have to drop your trousers so he can inspect you.  It feels strange when you think about it in advance but when i went the doctor was great, it was all very quick and no big deal.  Its up to you when you tell your parents, but I would definitely recommend that they (or maybe a different, older, relation who you are close to) take you to the doctor.  Whether you tell them before or after is your decision, but you will likely want them there when you come out of the docs, whether it is to share your relief or explain what's going on.  When I went in and was diagnosed I had to go for my operation a few days later so not much time to get our heads around it.  Remember that testicular cancer treatments are hugely successful, with success rates of up to 98% if caught earlier, and still 95% if its a bit later in stages.  Good luck, and if you want to pm me please feel free.  I wrote a blog at the time that you might want to have a quick read through as well."

cancer,30lbfg,NEHOG,1 point,Sat Mar 28 12:26:26 2015 UTC,"The questions have already been answered, so I'll throw my 2 cents in. Tell your parents. If this in fact cancer, you're going to want a support group. Doctors appointments, surgeries, treatment meetings. You're going to want help and a loving face looking back at you through all of it because it can be scary.   As for doctor. It's your preference. My primary care doctor is a female. I have a great rapport with her and had no hesitation on seeing her for my initial diagnosis. I would say though, start with your primary care doctor. Theyre going to want to be kept in the loop of everything going on, so when you start getting up with the specialists, they'll send their findings to your primary.   As stated before, its highly treatable. My doctors said to me ""the only people that die from this are people who stop getting help"".  Stay strong regardless of what happens, you're going to come out smarter and strong than before. Feel free to reach out if you need anything."

I had a somewhat similar problem when I was 15 (pilonidal cyst) and I understand how hard it can be! I finally did tell my mother (she suspected already...) which set me on the road to recovery. (long road, sadly, took a couple of years.)   Yes, and your doctor has seen a lot of naked people. Don't worry!   Well, if by chance you get a woman doctor, and it makes you uncomfortable, tell her. Doctors are both human, and (surprise!) they once were young too. They will understand. And if you want you can be examined without your mom present. (I had to have my mom shave my butt for two friggin years--geeze did I hate that!)   Cancer is NOT to be fucked with, do talk to your parents (I recommend you mom if at all possible, moms are better at this usually) so they can make an appointment with a doctor. And that appointment needs to be asap, don't delay."
cancer,30lbfg,NEHOG,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:26:33 2015 UTC,"I'd follow all the good advice given here. The sooner you get on top of this, the better your outcome will be, regardless of whether its cancer or not. You're only 13, and in sure it's tough. But be strong - you can do this and move on. All those things you are thinking of as embarrassing will be trivial once things get moving or if you find it's not cancer and get it all off your chest. I can imagine you must be feeling very stressed, but you will surprise yourself once you commit to a course if action. I've had testicular cancer and lost my wife and my dad to cancer. You don't want to mess around with this. Be strong, don't take any of those seemingly embarrassing moments to heart, and you'll come out on top!"
cancer,30lbfg,my_second_reddit,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:28:54 2015 UTC,"Hey, please get checked out, and do not take no for an answer.  It will absolutely feel odd to talk in an unfamiliar setting about balls, but the doctors are professional, and male or female, don't worry about it. (and, doctors know that teenage guys get boners all the time, so don't feel awkward or embarrased about anything.  The reason why it's so important to go early is because if this is a testicular cancer, catching it early is both very possible and very important.  You can expect a few specialists to drop your pants and grope your balls. Don't worry about it.  You may have an ultra sound, and your balls will be slathered with a goopy gel. You may have a CT scan, and when you get an IV, it'll feel warm, and slightly like you're pissing on yourself. The point is, it's fine, the doctors are professional, and to not feel embarrassed."
cancer,30lbfg,WinglessFlutters,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:45:33 2015 UTC,"I am a 45 year mom to a 14 year old son. All he would need to say to me is that he found a lump in his testicle and I would handle making the doctor appointment.   I think the doctor will want to see it and probably even touch the lump to see how big it is, if it is solid or squishy, if it is round or irregular shaped, etc.    Doctors see naked people all day everday. If your doctor has been working for 15 years...15 years= 690 weeks(6 weeks off every year for vacation)= 3450 work days= 34500 work hours . And with 15 minutes spent with each person that means your doctor has seen around 138,000 naked people, if my math is ok.  Now, what is your comfort level being naked in front of the doctor? My 14 year old son had to get a physical for school. We talked about it beforehand. He wanted me in the room, but with my head turned, so that is what I did. Make a game plan with your mom or dad before you go.   I am sure your lump is benign, but you need to tell your parents. Always better to be safe and get it checked out."
cancer,30lbfg,unusuallytallgnome,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:22:31 2015 UTC,"How can I tell my parents?   Just be frank, the sooner they can get you to a doctor the better.   Will the doctor see me naked?   Yes, but it is nothing they haven't seen hundreds of times before.  Doctors are professionals.   In your opinion, should I choose a female or male doctor?   Whatever makes you more comfortable.  I've had urologists of both genders and they have all been knowledgeable and professional.  When you go to the doctor they will palpitate the testicle and possibly do an ultrasound.  From there they usually order an MRI.  If they find a suspicious mass they will do a surgery to remove the testicle as early as possible.  Don't worry, if they end up removing a testicle it won't affect fertility and sex.    The most important thing is to get your parents to get you to a doctor as soon as possible!  Feel free to PM me if you need some resources or have any questions."
cancer,30lbfg,spiritbearrrr,1 point,Sat Mar 28 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"Fighting my test cancer atm, and this is what you need to do. Go see a doctor, and make him get an ultrasound done, this will show them basically what the lump is. My doctor treated mine as if it was an infection for 3 months (father had an infection so he figured it was the same). And eventually my right nut was the size of a kinder egg, dont let this happen lol. Whatever it is, you want to get ahead of it. If youre not sure about telling your parents, you can always wait until after you see a doctor before telling them."

Don't start writing your own eulogy.   Take every step one at time.

Take this time to write down questions for your doctor. If it's a tumor, be sure to address your fertility concerns upfront.   If you feel like you're going crazy waiting for the results, my advice is to write. Putting things on paper (or in text) will create an outlet for your thoughts. It helped me a lot during my leukemia diagnosis. Here's hoping it's not serious!"

cancer,30jj0p,sarilypuff,2,Fri Mar 27 22:29:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know what ""CA125 cancer marker 12"" means.  CA-125 is a marker mainly for ovarian cancer. It's most effective as a marker after surgery to monitor ovarian cancer recurrence. However, some esophageal cancers can raise CA-125.   I'd guess that the doctors are trying to figure out what's actually going on with her ovaries before they do any operation. Without a full picture of her scans and blood tests it's hard to give an exact reason as to why they're doing what they're doing."
