mainecoons,3dxvvn,Carostin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:42 2015 UTC,"They're not trimmed - we asked the same question, apparently when they were sucking their mother's teets they were sucked out by other kittens or something? They will grow back however!"

mainecoons,3dnngz,Zakadee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:54:39 2015 UTC,"Not the OP, but I've put softpaws on tons of cats (used to work in a vet's office). It completely depends on the cat, but if you are comfortable cutting their nails, that's a good indicator of how well both you and the cat will react. It take a bit of practice, but it's not a steep learning curve.  I've personally used them on one cat before, and they were fine. He sometimes would pull them off, but that's life. The worst thing was that I'd find softpaws all over the floor sometimes, since they naturally fall off after a while. Only a small annoyance, though."
mainecoons,3dnngz,Himekat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:19:54 2015 UTC,They are actually really easy to put on and stay on pretty well.  They definitely work in both protecting my apartment and reducing his scratching.  He definitely does not like the process of me putting them on but he tolerates it pretty well.  I try to replace them as they come off.  I'm not really against declawing but I figured since this works well there's no need to do it.

mainecoons,3cvtfl,Psynergy,3,Sat Jul 11 21:07:35 2015 UTC,"I adopted her and she wasn't a kitten, but the vet tells me she's roughly 2 years old this year. At first she hated the leash but got used to it after continued use and letting her walk around for an hour or so every other day on just the harness in the house. It didn't take very long and she actually brings me her harness when she wants to go out. I often tie her leash to the deck and let her walk and sit with us when we're outside. She still sometimes gets mad at the leash or harness, but its not bad.   The most important thing was always bringing her outside in my arms and never letting her think she can go out on her own."

mainecoons,3cg8f0,Justmetalking,3,Tue Jul 7 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your new addition. When I first brought my cat home, he hid under the bed...for two days! I brought food and water to him and he slowly acclimated to his new space. Where he lived before, there were two other cats, one was a tabby, the other a Maine Coon and a Yorkie. Honestly, they got along great. The Maine Coons seem to love attention, they would seek out the Yorkie who would rough house with them, they would roll around on the ground together like puppies.  I never once saw either of the Maine Coons being aggressive to other cats or to the dog. They do tend to find a perch where they can quietly observe the other animals but when they were together, be it eating time or when they were being groomed, there was never any aggressive behaviors.   Maine Coons are a whole different kind of cat, it's one of those things that's hard to explain, but you're in for a treat. Post pics :)"
mainecoons,3cg8f0,jenlen,2,Tue Jul 7 21:17:48 2015 UTC,"He's hiding a fair bit at the moment but does wander around a bit when the other cats are out.   Slowly making friends with the other cats, you're right, he's not aggressive but at the same time he's still not comfortable.  I'll get some pics up when he's a bit less elusive and settled!"
mainecoons,3cg8f0,NiceSprites,3,Sun Jul 12 11:26:56 2015 UTC,"Congrats on getting your first Maine Coon!  These cats are so awesome, and you will be glad you brought him home.  I can only speak about my Maine Coon, but I can say that she loves to fetch things. She loves to play in her water bowl (she often dips her paw in and licks the water off, other times she just drinks like any other cat).   She opens cabinet doors when she is in the mood. She bounds around the house, almost always a happy kitty. And she TRILLS, all the time. When I walk into a room, she greets me with a trill. When she walks into a room I am in, I get a trill. Kind of a chirp at times. She has a HUGE vocabulary of sounds and noises and I've learned most of them.  As for getting along with other cats, I have two gray tabbies that were here first. A male and a female. She's never had problems with the male. The female tried to bully her when she was small, but now that she's big, she lets her know she won't take her crap!  I've had cats all my life, and the biggest things I've noticed about Maine Coons:    more affectionate, but not too clingy much more intelligent than most cats I've known more vocal dog-like in how they like to fetch things, and follow you around   Good luck with your new furry friend!"
mainecoons,3cg8f0,addywoot,4,Tue Jul 7 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"Hehe, I can see that he's more intelligent than my other cats already (don't tell them that) but I do laugh every now and then when he bumps his head!  He's not opening doors or cabinets yet but he does seem to be observing how things work so I don't doubt it will be long before he does! That said he's figured out the bedroom slide door but to be honest that's not that hard to figure out!  He hasn't gone near water yet. In fact I've not seen him drink in 2 days! Beginning to get a bit concerned but he seems unaffected and is eating wet food and using the litter tray a fair bit so I'm not overly worried!   I'm already in love with the little guy. He's bigger than my other two already and he's still got more growing to do!"
mainecoons,3cg8f0,jenlen,2,Sun Jul 12 11:34:30 2015 UTC,"Hey!  My Maine Coon never drinks water.  I was so concerned when I moved in with my girlfriend and her cat Gandalf.  She told me he doesn't drink and I was sure she was wrong and should still have a water bowl out.  She was right though, he never drinks.  Its quite strange, but I have read that sometimes cats are a bit shy about drinking around you and that they get it in small quantities when nobody is looking (and usually from strange sources, not a water dish). I've also read that they really only need the water that is in the wet cat food, which I find hard to believe.  Anyway, not sure why they don't drink water, but if he never starts drinking water don't worry about it :)"
mainecoons,3cg8f0,addywoot,2,Mon Jul 13 03:33:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reassurance! Last night I managed to catch him drinking and you're right, he's very shy about it. The second he clocked that I was watching he scarpered!"

I'm actually in the process of switching my kittens over right now and have been researching foods. I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will chime in with more info, but what kind of food are you looking for? Royal Canin isn't the best, but they have a nice Maine Coon specific food that I'm using now. I assume Fossil is a kitten? http://www.zooplus.co.uk/shop/cats/dry_cat_food/royal_canin/breed_nutrition/217006  Generally, the higher the meat content, the better (and more expensive). This is kind of where I'm stuck. Raw food is undoubtedly the best when it comes to bang for your buck, since dry foods are loaded with fillers like grains and potatoes, but it can get pricey.   I've been considering this (sorry it's in Swedish, you can translate if you like) http://www.hemfoder.se/vom-og-kattemat-original-34-12-kg/ Nice because it's a frozen log you can just cut apart/thaw and it has everything they need. It's expensive (about $70), but my cats are my children so they will eat better than me. :p"
mainecoons,3byuvm,Theral,2,Fri Jul 3 11:59:13 2015 UTC,"I free feed mine Royal Canin Maine Coon dry food (they have a kitten version too). Best place to get it is online at zooplus. It's bigger in size than their regular food and the cats love to crunch it. [She gets wet food twice to three times a day but I vary the brands. Just don't use supermarket stuff as it doesn't have much meat in it. I tried a selection of the better foods from zooplus till I found one she liked that had a good meat content - Feringa, which is grain free.]   Recommend buying cat litter online there in bulk too, big cat = lots of poop. Oh, and a REALLY big litter box, mine was hanging over the edge of a regular sized one at 5 months old. While you're there throw in one of their feather danglers, cheap and amazingly birdlike.

mainecoons,3bicwf,addywoot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:47:56 2015 UTC,"This is from a breeder that has run into hard times and is returning to Germany.  There were 7 maine coons, Sky is the only one remaining.    Adoption fee is under 200.  From googling, this is the FireMountain Cattery in TN.  These are ex-breeder/show cats.    Please PM me or reply below and I will assist you if interested.  I will be fostering her at my home after picking her up today and can provide photos, videos, etc.    Shipping is unlikely to be an option."

mainecoons,3bdj6n,theyesplaces,2,Sun Jun 28 08:34:14 2015 UTC,Why did you shave him?!
mainecoons,3bdj6n,Quadratauge,7,Sun Jun 28 10:00:56 2015 UTC,I live in Southern California and he gets way too hot during the summer. After he gets shaved his energy level goes from listless to Tasmanian Devil.
mainecoons,3bdj6n,Quadratauge,2,Sun Jun 28 11:58:45 2015 UTC,Oh that's really good!  He surely is grateful for that.
mainecoons,3bdj6n,lynnb496,2,Sun Jun 28 14:00:48 2015 UTC,My Maine does the same thing. She really loves being shaved.
mainecoons,3bdj6n,Gryregaest,2,Mon Jun 29 12:26:58 2015 UTC,"We generally do this come summertime too. It seems to be common for long haired cats in general. Not only does it keep them cool, but they do tend to get mats and not all cats enjoy being brushed!"

mainecoons,3b2hck,ZanSquid,3,Thu Jun 25 21:24:36 2015 UTC,"What a lovely kitty you have!   I'd say there's a chance she has MC blood somewhere, but it's hardly definitive. She doesn't have many of the traits you might expect from a MC, but she does have some (eg coat length variation and a proportionally longer body carriage).   That's kind of the problem with MCs- when they're less than show-quality in conformation (i.e. the average pet MC) they can tend to look a lot like a floofy moggy. I have two- one who's a total classic, that you can tell is purebred from a glance, and one who honestly only tells his lineage from size and an excessively long tail. The kicker is that they're siblings, from the same breeder.   I guess the moral to this story is that short of genetic testing, you'll probably never know. But regardless of lineage, your kitty sure seems nice!"

Won't be dramatic, more his undercoat will start to pop out a bit more and they tend to be lighter.   I have a red flame coon sitting on my lap right now that was the most stricking color when little that I might be able to show you progression photos of the coat in a little while once I get them hosted."

mainecoons,3anx18,xampl9,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:54:39 2015 UTC,Are they alters? Gender?  What are their eating habits like? Have they had a hip & heart evaluation?  I'm in Austin and have been looking for an adult MC for a while.  Existing cat is a senior gray/white tabby (17 yrs) that free feeds.

mainecoons,3akgpf,_fiberoptics,2,Sun Jun 21 02:07:34 2015 UTC,"Pixel is mostly Maine Coon, with a few other things thrown in- we got her from a shelter, so we were never exactly sure. Her health started declining a few months ago, but only started showing symptoms earlier this week. It's been a hard week, knowing that her time left with my family wasn't long- especially since I'm out of state for work and haven't seen her since May, and only sparingly before then. When I was feeling particularly down this week, I searched for a subreddit for Maine Coons and found this community. I've spent much of my evenings smiling and even laughing at all the pictures- I can't explain how much it's helped. I just wanted to share some pictures of her and thank all of you for being here. Give your fluffy friend an extra chin scratch for Pixel and I tonight (or whatever their favorite thing is :) )."

mainecoons,3ahph7,Snatch_Pastry,2,Sat Jun 20 08:54:53 2015 UTC,Omg. I am so sorry to hear that! He's beautiful. And imo definitely plenty of Maine Coon in him. I hope you were able to get a new fur-baby to ease the pain.  http://imgur.com/DGMWjRB

mainecoons,3a81xw,DancesWithElectrons,2,Thu Jun 18 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"How old is she?  My Maximus is about 20 months, and he's in the gawky, lanky stage.  He's about 17 lbs - his sister looks much more proportionate as a grown cat would.  Artemis outweighs him at this point, she's about 18.5 lbs although he appears to be a much bigger cat.  They've broken a few lamps, ruined a few lampshades, pushed countless things onto the floor all because they took a long time to learn how big they really are."
mainecoons,3a81xw,DancesWithElectrons,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:01:50 2015 UTC,She's just about 14 weeks old so still tons of growing to do.  Her dad was about 20 pounds and her mom somewhere around 15 or so.   She has siblings from previous litters get even larger so we'll see where she winds up.
mainecoons,3a81xw,devils_chick,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:20:50 2015 UTC,I just looked and saw your two kitties - they're adorable!  I hope little Osha here grows just as much.
mainecoons,3a81xw,Snatch_Pastry,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  They are amazing.  Artemis is more outgoing with strangers, Maximus prefers to hang back and lets her check things out first.  Been a lot of fun watching them grow up.  I get tons if compliments at the vet, she thinks Max will go 25 when he is filled out.  His dad is somewhere north of 20 and his mom is about 16 or 17 I think."

She's growing a lot and runs non-stop so she uses a lot of energy.

mainecoons,397jar,heathere3,5,Wed Jun 10 07:58:09 2015 UTC,"No.  It isn't.  You are entirely wrong.  Particularly for Maine Coons.  If they live in a warm climate, it can be life saving for them.  We finally lost Percy after 19 years last fall, and he was shaved every 6 months for 18 of them.  It in no way harms them, nor is it cruel.  He loved it. Hell, a couple of years in, our groomer started using him as a training cat because he was so willing to help.  OP, do not let the poster above upset you.  Your cat is gorgeous, and you have done nothing wrong."

Either the fur has gotten matted or summer months of average temps of 32/33 degrees C is upon us.  What part of the process do you think is cruel?"

I volunteer with the humane society and he was returned by an older couple who had adopted him as a kitten. They kept him for six months and said that he was tearing up their furniture and was generally a bad cat. As it turns out, they hadn't been playing with him or giving him much attention at all. I adopted him immediately, and after a lot of work, he is the sweetest lap cat in the world... as long as he knows you. If not, he will hiss and swat at you. Totally worth it though."

I don't really care for him much different than my other cats, even though his personality is much different...food, water, love.  And some brushing. Sometimes they can be finicky about those litter boxes (like Persians) and because they are big require some improvising....I use a big tall sided plastic storage box without a lid for his box, he would have never been able to use a regular box!

She is so incredibly friendly, also, and often sleeps in the bed with half her body on our legs or sides lol. Very cute.  Edit: sorry, half asleep. I have noticed the litter thing, she needs it to always be cleaned before she feels comfortable using it, which is no problem.

mainecoons,380nv2,crinkie,4,Mon Jun 1 23:14:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't shave. My cat hates being shaved so much he had to be put under anesthesia in order to do so. Not worth the money or the risks.  The mats will fall off by themselves after a while or you can always cut them off yourself if you really care (with a comb between the mat and their skin so you don't cut any skin by mistake). But personally, my cat is much better off without any shaving or brushing (I still try to brush him every once in a while though...). The mats show up in the fall and in the spring and are gone after a month or so."
mainecoons,380nv2,JasterMereel42,6,Mon Jun 1 01:06:48 2015 UTC,"Also for the mats, you don't have to get the entire mat.  If you just get 1/2 to 2/3 of it out, the rest will most likely grow out or untangle fairly quickly."

mainecoons,380nv2,DancesWithElectrons,2,Tue Jun 2 16:33:09 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with your claim that the mats will fall off by themselves. They won't.   That said, you can snip them off yourself. They will probably be very close to the skin so you need to go hair at a time slowly with a very sharp, small scissors working side to side across the bottom of the mat.  It isn't always possible to train an older MC to get used to grooming, and just the noise of any shaver will often scare them, particularly if you get them as an older or rescue cat. But you can snip a mat out in a day or two if you are patient and careful.  But the mats are painful, so one way or the other do something about them."
mainecoons,380nv2,DancesWithElectrons,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:41:36 2015 UTC,"Whether or not they like being shaved depends on the cat. My cat loves it. She likes going to the vet, and she comes home and dances around the house. The groomer says she tries to help by rolling over and holding her legs up, and that she's better behaved than any dog.   I've been getting her shaved a couple times every summer for about 6 years. I usually get her mane shaved, so she's cooler. I don't shave her for any aesthetic reason, only so she's happier.  My sister-in-law just got her Maine Coon shaved for the first time, and while her cat didn't love the process as much as mine, she tolerated it just fine, and seems to like the end result."

I would expect you'd get your papers back between 1-2 months from when they received it, but it all depends on how many other cats they're working on at the same time.  This is kitten season, and the turnover time for show season (cat show year ends at the end of April), so they've probably got a lot more work than at other times of the year."

mainecoons,36n96c,H3llsWindStaff,8,Wed May 20 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"This is my 8 month old MC. Every now and then he likes to pee outside of his litter box on one of our couches. It's usually the same coach. I thought the root of the problem could be when, a couple of months ago, we changed the location of the litter box. We were'nt sure if he liked the new location/box or not. This is when the peeing outside of the box started...We have since moved the litter box back to its old location (while keeping the other litterbox in the new location, thus now having two litterboxes). All seems fine and he uses both litterboxes at this point....My other hypothesis is that he is peeing on the couch because he is angry with me about something. It could be the wet food which he doesnt seem to like very much, it could be that im not waking up early enough for him. He seems to do it when i lock him out of my room in the morning to get some sleep.   Has anyone ever dealt with a situation such as this? Any advice is greatly appreciated."
mainecoons,36n96c,Shanbear16,9,Wed May 20 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem with my cat (who isn't a MC). We consulted a cat behaviorist and she gave us excellent advice that seems to have solved the problem (7 months no pee outside the litter box so far). So I'll pass it on to you :)  Her recommendation based on what we told her (puddles of pee, not spraying, multiple litter boxes in the house already, no pattern as far as time of day went) was that it's probably a dislike of the litter. We used to use Swheat Scoop. Apparently she didn't like it. We were tasked with doing a litter experiment. We bought 10 boxes and filled each with a different type of litter (Swheat Scoop, Fresh Step, Scoop Away, Petco brand, etc.). We were also told to buy a really big litter box. She wanted us to get a kiddie pool and fill it with litter, but we found a really big box at Petco and went with that instead. We also needed to put boxes in other rooms of the house in case it was the location she objected to.  So we monitored which boxes she used the most and which locations they were in. We did this over the course of over a month. Each week if there was a box that wasn't used we'd remove it. Oh! And be sure to scoop regularly AND change over the litter each week. Verdict was that it wasn't the location per se (which was great as I was NOT a fan of a box being in my dining room), but she very clearly preferred the Petco brand the most with Fresh Step coming in second (which is great as Petco brand is the cheapest!). She also likes her box scooped regularly.    We didn't let my cat into the bedroom (peeing on the bed was her favorite place to go) and we bought couch covers and put some boxes on the couch when it wasn't in use. The cat consultant advised us to keep these things in use for a while. We still don't let our cats in the bedroom because my other cat is an asshole who likes to scratch the underside of the bed, but we did stop putting boxes on the couch. We kept the couch covers because they keep the cat hair off of the actual couch nicely. :)  Good luck! It takes patience (and a little bit of money if you have to buy several litters over the course of a month or two), but stick with it and see if the litter is the issue. It's so worth it! My husband was thisclose to giving up our cat. Luckily I wouldn't let him :)"
mainecoons,36n96c,hjonsey,3,Wed May 20 22:03:14 2015 UTC,"Mine does this and has since I got him. I found him at a shelter and no one would take him because he went on the floor (and the litterbox) The vet said he is perfectly healthy, I have tried everything anyone suggested to make this stop, but he tends to do it more when he knows there is another animal around. Do you have any other pets by chance? I only have him (plus a bunny who he doesn't interact with) and nothing else. I have also dedicated one of my bathrooms to him as well. That room his is litter box. My last apartment, he had his own bedroom. If he pees on the floor, I clean it. If we use that bathroom for showers or anything, he pees more. It is like he wants his own room. So I have given him one. It is a pain in the ass, but I would do it all over again. He is the best cat I ever had."

First, make sure you clean the spot on your couch with an enzymatic cleaner, otherwise he'll still smell the urine and will re-mark. Is he neutered? Unneutered males will spray. Is the litter box covered? Maine Coons are very large and may not like a covered box. Also make sure it's big enough for him. Make sure he's healthy, no urinary problems. Try using a litter called Cat Attract. Maybe try Feliway plug-ins. Good luck!"

The birds love it for their nests."

mainecoons,35pw48,DancesWithElectrons,4,Tue May 12 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"I don't use a Furminator - I think it wrecks the look of the coat.  I have a plain metal slicker brush that I use on my two MCs a few times a week, and a all-rubber brush as well.  Both of mine love being brushed.  Artemis will com and ask to be brushed some evenings.  Maximus loves it so much he gets over-excited and the teeth and claws come out to wrestle, so we take him a bit slower with the brush."
mainecoons,35pw48,DancesWithElectrons,2,Tue May 12 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I worry about the FURminator too cause it seems to strip out a lot of fur.  I also wonder how much food has to do with overall fur condition, although like I mentioned, parts of his coat are super soft."
mainecoons,35pw48,addywoot,2,Tue May 12 22:27:06 2015 UTC,Food plays a huge part in how nice a coat of fur is.
mainecoons,35pw48,mmccullen,2,Wed May 13 00:28:45 2015 UTC,Furminator does exactly what it should do - pulls out loose undercoat.  Cats have a LOT of hair.  You can also get metal groomer combs - does the same thing.

mainecoons,35pw48,CovingtonLane,2,Tue May 12 21:40:27 2015 UTC,"I'd really love some advice as to how to make Asami, our 5 month old, stop attacking the brush and enjoy grooming.   I've tried using treats but she gets bored of treats after 3 or 4, and she'll attack a toy instead, but it still seems like I'm stressing her out/putting her in play mode.   Any advice?"
mainecoons,35pw48,zorglubb,3,Wed May 13 01:30:49 2015 UTC,"You might try brushing your cat when he's sleeping. Be gentle, no roughhousing that will wake him up. He might figure out that the brushing is as good as petting."
mainecoons,35pw48,mbatthew,3,Wed May 13 02:33:18 2015 UTC,This is a good approach. I also stagger the brushes is a specific order. If I jump right in with the heavy brushes then they're inclined to complain right away but if I start with a soft brush and work my way up then it's more gradual and they are receptive to the transitions.
mainecoons,35pw48,Psynergy,5,Wed May 13 14:40:45 2015 UTC,"Mine hate the brush, so I try to get some brushing in while they are half-asleep. Gives me a little time to brush them before they get too annoyed."

I would give her one comb to attack, and at the same time would comb her with the other one. She finally grew out of it and now accepts combing. It does help if I groom them when they're tired or relaxed."
mainecoons,35pw48,Sinnocent,3,Thu May 14 21:39:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know, how I achieve this, but I tend to... err... dominate my maine coon. He doesn't like brushing very much, but when I do it, I just hold him firmly with one hand and he just behaves. He is not distressed or anything(I was around cats all my life, so I can probably tell), just sits there and waits patiently while his boss/mother(IDK how exactly he sees me) will end the procedure.  Now, bathing is altogether another story, though he likes water and even plays with toys in it."
mainecoons,35pw48,Himekat,2,Wed May 13 10:40:12 2015 UTC,"My kittens get quite playful with the brush too, so I try to distract them - I have two brushes, a soft one and a metal one. I comb them softly with the metal one while holding the soft brush in front of them - they play with that one and I comb them with the other one in the meantime. It helps quite a bit and lets me do quite some combing, I hope to get them to grow accustomed to the grooming process like this."
mainecoons,35pw48,Himekat,1 point,Wed May 13 09:28:51 2015 UTC,"Additionally, she's still a kitten so grabbing her scruff and putting her into limp-mode might help too. Mom cats do this to their bratty babies when cleaning them."

He goes to the groomer several times a year (they say he's such a good boy and I'm like ""are we talking about the same cat here?""). In between, I do brush him and keep parts of him trimmed down to prevent messiness/matting."
mainecoons,35pw48,AlienOctoPussy,1 point,Wed May 13 13:12:10 2015 UTC,"My thought was to take them to a groomer. Both of them are extremely friendly even if they can be a bit feisty come grooming time. I just don't want to scare them too much, plus it's really hard to find a place online that I can trust as many places seem to have inconsistent reviews. I'll see an excellent review written right next to a horror story for the same business."
mainecoons,35pw48,Sinnocent,2,Wed May 13 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. The place I go to luckily has always gotten stellar reviews, and it's a very small shop/business that takes a lot of care with their animals. My Maine Coon always seems pretty unfazed by stuff.

We have two, 1 year old half MC's with a tabby mix.  Loki keeps himself in fantastic condition and loves a good brush, Gizmo however is another story. We're having really big problems with matts, especially on his hind legs and belly. He won't let us anywhere near them :(  We have contacted several vets and groomers, all suggesting we put him under and get him shaved.... We're very reluctant to put him to sleep, as he was the runt of the litter and is just a little special. We bought a 'silent' pet friendly clipper, but it honestly does nothing, he is far too knotted and it's right down on his skin. The matts are now solid lumps and he kicks out whenever we try and get them. Can anybody help?  We're based in Northern Ireland and the only groomers who wouldn't put him to sleep are Pets at Home.... Would you recommend we try him there first?"

mainecoons,35kvba,Lifewiferp,7,Mon May 11 09:26:20 2015 UTC,"Mine have no sense of personal space.  When coming to cuddle, top of my chest is the favorite spot, so I get a face-full of fur.  They also have no idea how big they are - I've probably spent $150 on broken lamps and such in the 18 months they've been in our home.  Anything that can be a toy, will be a toy.  Someone swiped one of my hearing aids when I was in the shower, took me a half hour to track it down.  Mine are always up in my business.  When I start something, especially with small parts they're right there to supervise and assist."
mainecoons,35kvba,DancesWithElectrons,6,Mon May 11 22:45:26 2015 UTC,"Anything that can be a toy, will be a toy.   With the possible exception of commercially bought cat toys. Mine loves the plastic caps from soda bottles, drinking straws (especially when teething), balls of tin foil, laser pointers, thick rope tied from top of door, spiders, any flying insects, sheets of paper, bags and boxes, hair, glasses...pretty much anything except the bowl of cat toys that I bought her, which she doesn't consider to be playthings for some reason."
mainecoons,35kvba,SparrowDoll,5,Tue May 12 09:38:06 2015 UTC,"Things I learned the hard way:  -Don't teach a MC kitten to climb up your leg and sit on your head as you use the computer. It's a lot less cute when they are 20lb with long shaggy fur and claws like scythes.  -Keep the litter box super clean so they don't get matts of fur around their rear end.   -Brush them regularly, several times a day in shedding season or you will get hairballs the like of which you have never seen (and which will be deposited on the bathroom floor at 3am for you to step in).  -MCs often bond with one person in the family. It's not always the person that you want it to be (my friend refers to one of her MCs as ""my husband's cat"" as it is so strongly attatched to him).  -Even as kittens, MCs are big and long. Get extra large litter boxes and extra tall scratching posts. The normal sized ones will quickly become too small and the kitten sized ones were useless for my kitten at 3 months (butt hanging over edge of litter box, scratching post too small).   -You might need larger food dishes as some MCs hate it when their whiskers (which are very long) brush the edges as they eat, resulting in them pulling the food out of the dish onto the floor to eat.  -MCs love, love, love water. They drink a lot of it so if you don't want to find your MC sitting in the sink suckling the tap, consider getting a water fountain."
mainecoons,35kvba,PurpleWomat,2,Tue May 12 06:35:47 2015 UTC,"Mine is 3.5 months and my first - great advice, thank you.    My Mom was so pleased she taught Hemi to climb on her shoulders when she came over to visit.  I was like.. nope.  Not going to reinforce this."
mainecoons,35kvba,addywoot,8,Thu May 14 13:58:44 2015 UTC,"I have one pure bred Maine Coon. Her name is Harley (I've posted pictures of her before). She does have a lot of quirks. She tends to get her fur stuck in her mouth a lot while she's giving herself a bath, she meows whenever we leave the living room-telling us to come back. She's also not so much of a lap cat. She will stay near you but she won't be right on you. Everything is on her terms.   She is also freaking adorable. She will lay on her back sometimes and with how her feel curl, she gets bunny feet :D."
mainecoons,35kvba,Thelaw1031,5,Mon May 11 11:47:14 2015 UTC,"My cat Suzie will be a lap cat on her terms, which isn't a lot but it does happen. She is really affectionate and loves playing and being petted. She tends to prance from place to place and she chirps when she runs, which is awesome. She loves to hang out with us and will always be near, unless we let her in the garden where she will concentrate on the birds. All in all, just an awesome cat all the way around."
mainecoons,35kvba,paulwoodstudio,3,Mon May 11 15:59:26 2015 UTC,"Brush them a lot when they're young, even if they don't really need it that much. What they get used to as kittens, they will be comfortable with as adults. This will make your life a lot easier, since they need a fair amount of grooming and trying to brush a Maine Coon that doesn't want to be brushed will probably require two strong people and a pair of falconry gloves.  If you let them outside, be aware that they will likely come home with debris in their fur, at least some of the time. This can be seasonal or dependent on how well their fur is maintained. My old Maine Coon mix came to us in the winter with a lion cut (adopted at about 3 years old), and that spring and summer, after his fur had grown in and we started letting him outside, he would come in looking like a sniper in a gillie suit. Though strangely enough, not the following fall, I think maybe more of his undercoat had grown in by then, or he was cleaning himself better. Or maybe he just got better about not laying in mulch so much. But needless to say, when he had all that stuff in his fur, if you didn't at least give him a cursory brushing, he would leave a trail of yard debris in the house.  Be careful how aggressively you play with them. Because of their size and strength, play bites can hurt a lot more than they would from other cats. All cats can sort of ""go wild"" when they get overstimulated by play (you know, that thing when the pupils get all big and the claws come out), but not all cats are huge monsters like Maine Coons.  In my experience, they want to be your buddy - they're very sociable and like to follow you around and be involved in whatever you're doing, but aren't always necessarily lap cats. There's a lot of room for individual personalities, though. Like with a lot of cats, they do sometimes get to be more of a lap cat as they get older and calmer."
mainecoons,35kvba,Gryregaest,1 point,Tue May 12 18:53:26 2015 UTC,Would not recommend letting them outside without supervision.  MCs are way too sociable and trusting.

mainecoons,35kvba,zorglubb,5,Wed May 13 20:10:32 2015 UTC,"It's common knowledge, but they will get BIG! Like, 20-30 lbs!  My MC gets a lot of mats in her fur, and it can be tricky taking care of them. The one's on her chest and shoulders can be dealt with if treated carefully, but I can do nothing about the ones on her haunches and legs; she gets VERY fussy about that area and doesn't really let me groom her. When I do, I can make a little progress, but she will not react well. That said, she has never bitten me hard nor scratched me ever.  Similar to what /u/Thelaw1031 said, mine is not a lap cat; affection is on her time and terms.   Also, and this is something I've noticed from more than one MC that I've encountered, they are very quiet cats; mine almost never meows, and purs very quietly as well. The flip side of that, when she does meow, it's a tiny and adorable sound.  That's all I can think of for now, but if anything else comes to mind I'll add more!"

He snuggles a lot, but only when he wants to and it's usually in the most inconvenient place. He bullies our medium-sized dog, a lab. And also washes the dog's ears for her."

mainecoons,35ikhm,cexwaluica,3,Sun May 10 21:49:15 2015 UTC,It cannot be trusted.  Maine Coon is a descriptor in how it's used - not a real breed distinction.  Even Maine Coon rescues would have non-MCs.
mainecoons,35ikhm,addywoot,3,Mon May 11 18:07:43 2015 UTC,"For a kitten from a registered Main Coon breeder, they start out at about $800 for both females and males.  Some breeders will breed for certain traits (size, coats, etc) and those prices can range up to $1600. Size is the most valued trait but a good breeder will tell you they can't guarantee a kitten will get huge. Males are usually more expensive."
mainecoons,35ikhm,zxcless,1 point,Sun May 10 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"We ended up paying about $900 initially for just the kitten from a reputable breeder, plus a $100 deposit that we got returned to us upon certification that the little guy had been neutered (ended up costing us around $400, I think. We had him put under for it which is why it was so expensive; figured it was more humane, and he still doesn't get freaked out at the vet, so I'd say it was worth it). We pay about $20-30 a month in decent quality food (blue buffalo), and about $10 a month on toys or larger items (like a cat tree) bought over time. He's pretty damned spoiled.   I'd say in a year, we probably spend around $600 on him in food, regular vet checkups, and toys/furniture to keep him entertained. That all being said, he's worth ten times what we paid for him. He's the sweetest, most social cat I've ever owned, has the best sense of humor (no seriously. He's hilarious), gives the best cuddles, and is the best friend a girl could ask for. Definitely worth the investment.   We went the breeder route (long story as to why, but it boils down to knowing I literally couldn't handle the heartbreak if something bad happened), but I'd say go the adopt route if you can. It's cheaper, and the friend you'll make is one for life."

Quite a shock after the peace and companionship of an older cat.   You might consider adopting a retired queen or adult cat from a breeder. They often have good quality cats around 5 years old that have retired from breeding and need a good home. Since they are more mature, the breeder will be able to give you an extremely clear idea of their personality whereas with a kitten it's largely guesswork.  I type this with one hand because the kitten is currently teething (quite successfully, judging by the increasing pain levels) on my other hand. This is a big improvement from her other favorite thing to teeth on, live electrial wires. Don't dismiss older cats and breeders entirely."

You can some times find them for free on Craigs List or Kijiji.  I however would caution against buying a kitten from an unregistered breeder or getting a so called ""cross breed"" as 99% of these cats are just tabby coloured domestic long hairs."
mainecoons,35evjn,Schedule22,1 point,Sat May 9 22:07:03 2015 UTC,Amazing how often they end up in shelters. Worth a quick internet check?
mainecoons,35aqdn,slickiedoo,13,Fri May 8 15:11:59 2015 UTC,"Maine coon features are VERY strong and easy to identify. Looking at him I would have to say that he's probably not a mix. The only resembling feature to a maine coon here is the ears. Coat isn't thick or long enough and the face shape is pretty far off. He's mostly likely a mix of multiple breeds, and more along the domestic lines.  Also just remember that 'calico' is not a breed, it is a coat pattern that consists of 2 colors plus orange, most commonly orange, white and black.  My pure bred for reference.  https://i.imgur.com/HObCgWX.jpg"
mainecoons,35aqdn,BKLounge,6,Fri May 8 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a gorgeous cat!!!  These were my suspicions, we've always just had mixed breed domestic cats, but because he's so big, she swears up & down that he's Maine Coon mix.   The calico has a couple of orange spots...of course, none of them are in the photos. Hah  Thanks for your reply!!"
mainecoons,35aqdn,Snatch_Pastry,4,Fri May 8 18:07:20 2015 UTC,"I took in a young stray orange tabby who eventually grew to about 16 pounds, very little fat. Some cats are just giants. Also, if their mom was a stray, it's possible for your two cats to have different fathers, even though they're the same litter."
mainecoons,35aqdn,Snatch_Pastry,2,Fri May 8 20:09:06 2015 UTC,He's 2 years old and a solid 16 pounds. I imagine their mom was a stray...though I don't know under what circumstances they ended up at the shelter at 1 year old. They'd only been there a week when we adopted them.  Thanks for the reply!

At first I put the harness on him and he would wear it around the house for an hour or two supervised, I would always give him a treat and praise him after every session. Once he was used to the harness I clipped on the leash! Lots of treats, praise and patience is key! Eventually you won't need the treats! My max now purrs every time we get his harness out.

She was dumped at a friend's vet practice when her previous owners decided she wasn't pumping out enough kittens. She's 6, and has basically lived her whole life in a cage. She was going to be euthanised if I didn't take her.   This is the first cat I've ever actually had. First Maine Coon I've ever encountered too. After I got her, I started googling around and getting some info on them. Boy, when I saw that Maine Coons are really really affectionate, they weren't wrong. Got her last night, and she wouldn't leave my side, smooching me all night.  Anyway, she doesn't currently have a name (or she probably does, but no one has any idea what it is.)

If you do not trust your vet get a new one.  This could be a personality difference from cat to cat.  Come will eat until they explode as long as you give them more food.  Others will only eat a reasonable amount even if you give them a huge amount of food.  Keep an eye on his belly.  If you cannot easily feel the ribs (feel not see) then you may want to consider restricting food intake. Automated toys may help with this.  I have also had a lot of luck with a ball in a track that they can play with solo.  I feel like kittens have a better attitude about accepting new people and animals than older more established cats.  I think either way would work, but there will be more effort in getting an adult cat to accept a dog into it's territory."

Some respiratory infections take awhile to go away, and you don't want this turning into something worse.  My two MC kittens ate a lot - especially when they were in a growth spurt.  Mine just got dry food and a bit of wet as  a treat.  With everything you are feeding, you might be overfeeding.  How much of each is she getting?  My older cats would eat maybe 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of dry food and a little bit of wet a day.  The MCs were going thru a cup each of dry food and a 1/4 can of wet when they were like 6-9 months old and in growth spurts.  Now it's more like 1/2-3/4"" cup each plus the wet food.  Ask your breeder for advice, too."
mainecoons,3424yp,DancesWithElectrons,2,Tue Apr 28 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"I'm feeding as per my breeder's instructions: free access too Royal Canin MC Kitten Food (dry), Royal Canin Kitten wet food in the morning and afternoon, and fresh meat (turkey/chicken thigh/leg) in the evening. My surprise is probably due to this being my first kitten. I guess she's growing a lot.   She's the runt of the litter, when I first got her, she was gulping down food and clearly afraid it would be stolen. That fear seems to be gone now and she'll happily leave food on her plate and come back later so I suppose that she'll regulate herself. It's just...wow...eating a lot. Must be doing some serious growing.  Have to drop into vet next week for worming tablets so I'm gonna ask her about the snot then."
mainecoons,3424yp,Psynergy,3,Tue Apr 28 13:58:17 2015 UTC,"We really dislike royal canin because of the amount of corn/Wheat in it. I have a feeling if you change to something that's corn and wheat free, she may eat less because she'll feel full more quickly  Also the sneezing lasted a month with Asami. Your vet may recommend some immuno boosting gel to put in her wet food"

mainecoons,33zmju,gpzj94,3,Mon Apr 27 03:01:46 2015 UTC,"The shedding never ends. A good brushing every two days will keep it in check, a furminator will help but its not going to 100% kill the shedding.   Understand that a normal brush is not going to strip the coat down real quick, you need to get a breaker brush.  Something like this.   http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzA4WDU4OA==/$T2eC16FHJGkE9no8fyypBQCCU,04ow~~60_35.JPG      You need to be very careful when using one though as you can nick the skin pretty easy. Eventually you are going to want to get a set of greyhound combs as well, these are great for catching the loose hair and they can be used on other breads to pull out hair above the tail and along the chest and back with minimal fuss. They are not cheap though.   Will look like this. Good greyhounds combs are 40-50$ a piece for the namebrand. The knockoffs can be 1/10th the cost.   http://www.groomersmall.com/images/Etchbackcombs-LG.jpg  Take solace in the fact that a Maine Coon does not shed as much as most other long hair cats, my Persian and highlands fold can generate 5-7x the amount of hair in shedding season and they are 1/3 the size. I have a picture somewhere of the hair that I can get from a Persian that would make you think that I have another cat.     http://i865.photobucket.com/albums/ab211/wearymicrobe/33917803413907889_54iHUTBZ.jpg"
mainecoons,33zmju,wearymicrobe,2,Mon Apr 27 04:09:47 2015 UTC,"Our breeder told us we needed to comb them every day using combs like the ones in wearymicrobe's link. There is still fur all over the house, but daily combing gets a lot of it.   Comb the full body, especially paying attention to the areas under the legs."
mainecoons,33wl05,FrouFrission,11,Sun Apr 26 09:04:21 2015 UTC,"If hes having a reaction to a shot, I would take him to a vet just to be sure. Kittens kinda... die easy, unfortunately. Give him a nice cardboard box, no loud noise or bright light and lots of fluid. And take him to the vet to be sure.  Also /r/cats or /r/veterinary may be better for this"
mainecoons,33wl05,ZanSquid,5,Sun Apr 26 09:29:57 2015 UTC,"Keep a close eye on, but it's not unusual for kittens to get upset digestive systems after vaccination.   Make sure your kitty is still getting plenty of fluids and see if you can convince him to eat. Cooked chicken is gentlest on sad kitten tums :) But if your baby isn't eating or drinking at all, go back to the vet. He may need to go on IV fluids for 24 hours while he gets over it.   If baby needs bathing of nastiness, try getting a damp cloth/towel and wiping gently at his fur with it. It'll feel more like being bathed by mum and won't be as stressful as being covered in his own poop."
mainecoons,33wl05,DancesWithElectrons,5,Sun Apr 26 11:52:41 2015 UTC,"Moogle is doing better, already - breeder asked to see how they were doing and said that she is familiar with the situation. Moogle is drinking water and showing more and more activity, but we're keeping an eye on him to be sure :)"
mainecoons,33wl05,wearymicrobe,2,Sun Apr 26 13:25:27 2015 UTC,"With little ones, I get them to the vet to be sure.  Have you changed their food?  With kittens, that may be a cause, too.  To clean them, a wet washcloth with warm water only will help you clean their fur.  Just make sure Moogle doesn't get too wet and start losing body heat.  A couple short sessions of cleaning is probably better than one long one.  Might consider keeping him confined to the bathroom with a litter, to keep the messiness confined."
mainecoons,33wl05,addywoot,1 point,Sun Apr 26 12:15:13 2015 UTC,Did they do more then one vaccination at the same time? Or biggest boy kahn still does this when he gets more then one at a time at the vet. We have the vet rotate the vaccinations to one once a year when he goes in for his checkup and he is much better for it. The rest of the guys get them all at the same time as they do not have the same reactions.

mainecoons,33tpnb,picturethefuture,3,Sat Apr 25 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"We found her on a website here in Sweden where you can buy or sell things directly to other people without a middle hand. We thought she was super cute and she was sold for a very low price for being a maine coon so we decided to go and see her. We fell in love with her instantly! We were a bit curious though why she was so cheap. The breeder told us that she and her two siblings hadn't been conceived on purpose, i.e. the mating was not planed, and therefore her pedigree was not valid and they couldn't sell her for a full price. So we got an amazing cat for half the price. Lucky us!"

mainecoons,33q9la,anemeth90,7,Fri Apr 24 16:54:26 2015 UTC,"Maine Coons are the cool breed these days, so lots for shelters, and some stores for that matter, will label a cat as part or full Coon when they aren't. This is very common, so just be aware that a shelter might simply be calling a cat a Maine Coon because they have a few of the features and it's easier to get them adopted that way."
mainecoons,33q9la,Radio_Flyer,2,Fri Apr 24 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"Good point. We saw a number of adoptions listed as MC mix that exhibited none of the MC traits in person, besides a long coat!"
mainecoons,33q9la,chinkysuavo,6,Fri Apr 24 20:24:59 2015 UTC,"My wife and I recently went through a similar search and ended up buying our kitten through a reputable local breeder.  Although initially we both felt a rescue cat would be the socially responsible thing to do, after months and months of searching/phone calls/visits to local shelters/adoption events, we just could not find the right cat. Our requirements were a bit more stringent as my wife is a life long dog lover, has never owned a cat, we've got 2 young children, and 2 small dogs at home. After much discussion and research, we decided an adopted (potentially feral) cat would not be a good option for us, there would be too many things we and the cat would have to get accustomed to.   Your chances are definitely better if you're open to a more mature cat, and your home situation is a bit more...quiet, as we did come across a few older coon mixes.   I can tell you from first hand experience though, none of the cats we met in our search was as outgoing, affectionate, and tolerant as the kitten we ended up taking home from the breeder. Now, I know not all bred cats will adapt so well, but we had plenty of opportunities to meet with him and his littermates, talk to the breeder, and interact with the parents.   Ultimately my wife and I were very confident we had chosen a good addition to our family before we plunked down the cash. I have to admit, he's been worth every penny!   Hope that helps!   TL;DR wife never had a cat, went through a breeder and got exactly what we were looking for."
mainecoons,33q9la,chinkysuavo,5,Fri Apr 24 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"My boy is a half-Maine Coon that got dumped along with the rest of his litter in a shelter.  Owners were breeding Maine Coons, female got out, and she had a litter of mixed-breeds.  As far as purebreds, though, I've never seen one in a shelter here (I live in GA)."
mainecoons,33q9la,whistlingbudgie,2,Fri Apr 24 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen there are usually a good amount of Maine Coone mixes in shelters that need homes. Shelter cats can be amazing. There are a few breeders in New England area who would have purebreds, but also at a higher cost. My cats mother came from a breeder in Maine, and I think the cost was around $200. Good luck!"
mainecoons,33q9la,razzledazzle125,3,Fri Apr 24 19:06:44 2015 UTC,"Wow in Cali, the shelter adoption fee is already close to $200. I'd be weary of a breeder selling a purebred MC for so little. From experience they tend to cost more on the coasts (US).   My red non-poly male was $800 from a Cali breeder, and that was on the cheaper end of the spectrum since I was willing to drive 2 hours to the breeder."
mainecoons,33q9la,chinkysuavo,2,Fri Apr 24 21:36:21 2015 UTC,"I wasn't the one who purchased her so I'm not 100% on the price. $200 may have been low, but I do believe her got two sister kittens for under $500. It was a small breeder in a small town in Maine. Not sure if she even advertised or not. But anyways, MC's are amazing cats. Purebred or not...:)"
mainecoons,33q9la,razzledazzle125,2,Fri Apr 24 22:46:57 2015 UTC,That is extremely cheap for a MC. Was she an adult or a kitten? Around here (DC) the cheapest I have seen is $450-$500.
mainecoons,33q9la,zero44,2,Fri Apr 24 20:30:44 2015 UTC,"Purebred or even half-bred Maine Coons disappear from shelters quickly when they do appear.   If you are willing to adopt an older cat, something to consider is adopting a Maine Coon past reproductive use from a breeder. A lot of breeders will adopt out their cats when they are done breeding them. This way, you are sort of ""rescuing"" the cat and giving it a loving home, but you also know it's been properly brought up and socialized and is a purebred Maine Coon. If you're interested in that, look for local breeders online and either call them to ask if they are going to be adopting out any of their older males/females, or sometimes it will say on the website."
mainecoons,33q9la,Himekat,2,Fri Apr 24 20:30:22 2015 UTC,"The local shelters, and if you're in or near a larger city the no-kill/foster organizations should have websites. These are easy to browse every few days, instead of repeatedly going around to shelters.   Additionally, you could use petfinder.com. Here's a search for Maine Coons in Philadelphia. Our you can just use your zip code to make it more specific.  Edit: I just followed my own link and it said there were no matches found. When I created the search, it found over 1500. So just go to https://www.petfinder.com and make your own search."

mainecoons,33q9la,Phyrexian_Starengine,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:24:03 2015 UTC,I looked for a long time for a rescue - I'm in the Philly 'burbs.  Most of the MC rescues I found were in the NYC area.  So I started looking and interviewing breeders.  Ended up getting 2 and I couldn't be happier.
mainecoons,33q9la,DancesWithElectrons,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"I got my MC from a rescue group, but I just happened to go super early one Saturday, and she had just been put up for adoption. They even had her papers from her first owners, though I suspect she's from one of those dodgy petstores that sells purebreds from kitten farms.   So you could try going first thing in the morning to adoption fairs?"
mainecoons,33nder,theRAM90,12,Thu Apr 23 22:50:39 2015 UTC,"Well, you have two options. First, Google for breeders near your geographic location. If you are absolutely dead-set on having a pure breed MC, then it'll cost you about $1000.   Second, and better, option: find out what your local no-kill/foster organization is called. Visit their website and see what they have available. Go to other local shelters like the ASPCA. They'll probably have websites too. Last year, I adopted a mostly MC, and that was good enough for me."
mainecoons,33nder,Snatch_Pastry,14,Thu Apr 23 23:14:04 2015 UTC,"I adopted a mostly MC, and that was good enough for me.   I've had two, best kitties ever."
mainecoons,33nder,Snatch_Pastry,3,Fri Apr 24 00:20:23 2015 UTC,"He was the best, and that's what made what happened so devastating. I had been wanting a Maine Coon for a long time. He was about three years old when I adopted him. He was a super cat, very relaxed, accepting, laid-back, friendly, and LOVED to be brushed. Also very quiet, had almost no voice at all. But he came down with FIP, and passed away a few weeks ago. I only had him for about 9 months. And my little calico girl was really moping around, and was obviously missing him. But because of him, I was determined that I was going to get another MC.   But instead, when I went around to the local shelters I accidentally met a gorgeous medium-hair jet black kitten with a super fluffy tail, who is chatty and lovey and loves to be pet and to play fetch. And my little girl loves him. So my dreams of having a Maine Coon have been put off again, because I found the perfect cat."
mainecoons,33nder,Snatch_Pastry,6,Fri Apr 24 04:31:00 2015 UTC,Well that is just as good. You can live vicariously through /r/mainecoons
mainecoons,33nder,nm1745,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:39:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I think living vicariously is maybe the wrong way of describing it. I'll stay subscribed because I'm enamored of the breed, but at this point I don't feel like my life is worse because I don't have an MC. My two kitties are outrageously good looking and personable, and they adore each other already. I NEVER even thought about adopting a black cat, but this guy was just so engaging I couldn't resist."
mainecoons,33nder,tro227,4,Sat Apr 25 06:50:17 2015 UTC,This. Your area might even have a maine coon rescue. I got my coon mix for $30 during san diegos humane society kitten week. He is the best cat I have ever met. Wouldnt trade him for anything.

mainecoons,339n5u,cboike86,10,Mon Apr 20 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"Take her to the vet. She might have dry skin and need a special diet for a little while, or a new allergy that requires an antihistamine. Better safe than sorry!"
mainecoons,339n5u,AlaskanFeesh,3,Mon Apr 20 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely go to the vet, like the other commenters suggested! Just as an aside, my Maine Coon developed sores/pimples on his chin when he was younger--turns out that (iirc) cats are allergic to plastic, so every time he ate out of his plastic bowl it irritated his skin. That sure doesn't explain the sore your kitty has on the back of the neck, but maybe it'll help with the one under her chin!"
mainecoons,339n5u,queensbrin,2,Tue Apr 21 01:55:00 2015 UTC,"Likely an allergic reaction.  Might be environmental; she might have become intolerant to something she is eating; even if not fleas, it might be some parasite that you aren't seeing.  A vet visit is always a good idea especially if you haven't been there for a while.  But I'd try a different food first, possibly a good canned food if she's accustomed to dry.  Even if it doesn't help, it's another data point you can share with the vet when you do go."

mainecoons,32ba6o,tigrrbaby,6,Sun Apr 12 07:11:09 2015 UTC,"I have not worked w them as I am located in MA. That being said I did obtain my Maine Coon through a breeder. I was in contact w her for a few months prior to deciding to put a deposits down. In putting the deposit down I was actually invited to her home where she allowed myself and my mom to see her home where she breeds the cats, as well as spent an hour talking to us and allowing us to play with the kittens who were at that time about 8-10 weeks. From there we decided on the kitten I had best bonded with and I was allowed to pick him up on the 12 week mark when she allows them to get to their new homes. I'm unsure if it is common practice, but I much enjoyed being able to see that they were bred and kept in a neat and well maintained home and also was able to meet the parents and kitten I would by taking home. That being said I know some breeders do ship and its not a possibility for everyone to meet prior to purchase. Definitely ask questions and get some photos... For the money you pay they should at least be able to oblige w that!"
mainecoons,32ba6o,withinthebelljar,2,Sun Apr 12 16:44:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was pretty taken aback at first about the rules, but I understand that they breed out of their home and I get what they're saying about security and health issues.   Basically, they post photos when the kittens hit either 6 or 8 weeks, I can't recall, and take reservations based on the photos. I suppose I could tell her ""I want the kitten that is most ____"" out of this litter, but I'm a little reticent when spending an amount that will take me a year to save up, you know?  I definitely want to meet some previous customers before I even start saving up for one. If they really are breeding consistent personalities as much as they are breeding consistent looks, I think I would be pleased, but I need a third party confirmation of that.  Thanks for the info though!"

She'd been through multiple homes already and was terrified of children, though I never found out exactly why. What cured it in the end may sound odd but it worked: I let her bite me. When she bit me, I would stay very calm and talk to her in a quiet, soothing voice (hard when she was gnawing on my arm) and not react or jerk away. After about a week, she stopped biting completely. Not really sure of the psychology behind it, was just happy that it worked."

When I adopted him his name was McMuffin I would act out too if I had such a terrible name!

She's a sweet girl, but ""vapid"" doesn't come close to covering it. Supposedly the breed are meant to be intelligent, but so far as I can tell it's a coin toss. She got the looks, he got the brains, we like to say.  EDIT: Once I took my girl outside supervised (she's too dumb to be left unattended), and she caught a sparrow that was trapped in our greenhouse. I was expecting to have to clean up a dead bird, but when I told her to drop it, she put it on the ground and looked totally baffled when her toy flew away. Poor sweet, dumb baby."
mainecoons,31w6a1,ZanSquid,5,Thu Apr 9 06:21:05 2015 UTC,My girl... is dumb. But we've chalked it up to the early separation from her mother. She didn't learn to cat from her mom so she's a bit dumb.
mainecoons,31w6a1,SLewis234489,5,Thu Apr 9 01:24:45 2015 UTC,Ahhhh...that could be.  The breeder tried to give us our Jojo when she was just six weeks old.  We took her at seven only because the breeder got mad at us.  That might explain things.  She's never bonded with our indoor/outdoor cat because he hates everyone and everything.
mainecoons,31w6a1,SLewis234489,2,Thu Apr 9 01:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. We got ours from someone in town. She just walked into their house one day and they couldn't keep her. We lived in a city so we think her mom got hit by a car or something else happened. So no one taught her how to jump, sleep, or do other cat things."
mainecoons,31w6a1,Lailah20,5,Thu Apr 9 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure it is about the personality, nothing else.  I have two Maine Coon boys and previously we had a Maine Coon girl. Our problem with the girl was that she was like an ""ice queen"" - no touching, no cuddling, no holding - stunning, large cat, but... difficult.   My both boys are still quite young (2.5 and 1.5 years old), but for a very long time we thought they are both very silly, almost dumb.   We recently realised that it was them who trained us, humans, to do exactly what they want. They both do not cat very well, jump and run like elephants (very loudly! not cat-like at all!). Both sometimes fall off things like cupboards or window sills. They are decent climbers and like heights. Coming down is a different story... :)  The younger one is scared of EVERYTHING and every louder noise. Leeks (the vegetables) give him a heart attack. Don't ask me why - we discovered it by accident.   The older one is pretty sure he is a dog. Yes. He fetches, comes to your lap, gives paws and jumps on the chair on command. Well, only to men - my partner and my son.  Oh and he does pretty well in cat harness.   From my experience (9 years in total with various Maine Coons) - intelligence is extremely random. I believe the cats can be trained some new stuff, but only if they want to learn. If you are patient and persistent, you may succeed :) Good luck!"
mainecoons,31w6a1,Fiyazai,8,Thu Apr 9 12:17:11 2015 UTC,"I had a Maine Coon with poo-brain and he was still decently adjusted. As far as I know, Maine Coons are supposed to be a highly intelligent breed. I have one, who isn't poo-brained, and he plays fetch. Some cats do stupid crap for attention, is that a possibility here?    She caught a mouse once and just fell asleep on it. Chased it. Put it in her mouth. Put her two front paws on it. Fell asleep   I've seen cats do stuff like this. They like the chase more than the kill."
mainecoons,31w6a1,DoubleGSpot,3,Wed Apr 8 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"She was probably removed from her mother too early, or wasn't socialised with certain aspects of catting. The trees being an example. As for the mouse thing, not every cat is a killer. Some cats lack the dexterity to retract their claws, or they get nervous and can't retract them because they're anxious. She very well may just have had a bad time as a kitten with groups of people, breeder and potential buyers etc. (Source: cat behaviour specialist, vet-tech)"
mainecoons,31w6a1,lynnb496,3,Thu Apr 9 02:14:52 2015 UTC,"Nah. It's just like any species... some individuals are brighter than others, and they all have different specific interests and tendencies.   I have a Female Maine Coon who is absolutely sharp as a tack, super talkative and social, and a deadly killer of all things rodent. She opens doors, will wait patiently for hours stalking a mouse or bird, sits on my lap and watches TV with me, loves belly rubs and being held, and chirps and whistles at the bird feeder while watching it through the window.  Kitties are all different and have different personalities... that's why I love 'em so much. Yours is who she is, take it or leave it. I say take it!"
mainecoons,31w6a1,headbangz,3,Thu Apr 9 06:09:48 2015 UTC,"My Maine pretends to be dumb, but she's not. She can be sneaky when she wants to be. Usually it's in stealing the other cat's food, but sometimes it's other things, like opening closets and exploring. She knows lots of words, and does ""sit"", ""sit up"", ""lay down"", and ""play dead"".   But she also is intimidated by lots of people, and hides any time someone rings the doorbell. She's apparently afraid of heights, and spends five minutes gauging the height of a chair before jumping in it (even though she's as tall as the seat). She tries to make friends with bugs instead of hunting them. And if her alpha cat mixed breed ""sister"" is around, she plays dumb and adoring fangirl.  I do think cats are like people, and have a huge variety of personalities and intelligences. But that makes our relationships with them more precious."
mainecoons,31w6a1,ananonumyus,6,Thu Apr 9 10:58:51 2015 UTC,It's probably just her personality. I had one who was a bit skittish around people he didn't know... it was just a year or 2 ago that he's finally come around and not running from every new person who enters the house.

He kills birds, mice, squirrels, raccoons (small ones, but still), rabbits, voles, gophers...basically anything that crosses his path.  The neighbors all know if he's under the weather because suddenly there's wildlife in the cul de sac.    He can open doors.  He can turn on faucets.  He terrifies all of the dogs in the neighborhood yet charms all of the neighbors to let him into their houses.  I would NEVER let another person's cat in my house, but my neighbors (3 houses) are all, ""oh, he just sits on the couch and watches tv with us"".  He plays fetch, but only on his terms.  If you point to something, he looks where you're pointing.  He knows a ton of words for a cat.  ""out"", ""hungry"", ""eat"", ""nip"", ""treat"", ""bed"", ""water"", ""thirsty"".....IDK, maybe he's trained us.  He's a cool cat who thinks he's batman.  Jojo is his polar opposite.  So dumb."

mainecoons,31w6a1,wearymicrobe,2,Thu Apr 9 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"In all my recent dealings with Maine Coons and from the tale my breeder friends tell me, it's completely random! One just had a litter full of terrors and the other just had one where 'brain is optional'. The parentage seems to have an effect, perhaps it's because the kittens take cues from them? I seem to remember them telling me that the male cats are usually more of the simpler, lazy kind though overall it's half half. Maybe the kitten God just flipped a coin everytime one was born.   My cat is pretty smart. She can open sliding doors, knows when to get my attention for food, can chase moths like a lean mean killer (she's an indoor cat) and can get onto anything tall through some kind of magic (and down again) . She loves watching people but pats are only on her own terms. She's very neurotic at times but not skittish (she'll just claw you instead). She is a cats' cat through and through.   In contrast my house mate's cats (one passed away a few years ago)  are both very... Dumb. They fail at things like jumping, eating, what's that a moth? Whatever. Got stuck dangling from the cat tree because they didn't know how to retract their claws, etc. Most of the time they failed at pooping inside the litter box even when we got ones the size of Texas.   So from the 3 sample size plus my friends stories it seems to be completely random!"
mainecoons,31w6a1,DrNotEscalator,4,Wed Apr 8 22:42:14 2015 UTC,Oh the FALLING.  I've never had a cat who just randomly falls off things so much!  She's such an adorable derp.

mainecoons,31w6a1,TweaktheReaper,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:04:50 2015 UTC,"Maine coons seem to run the gamut. My boy is sweet as can be but dumb as a rock, will lock himself in rooms and will fall off things constantly. He has no idea how to cat.   My last female could kill just about anything under 3x her weight, she would pickup dirty clothes and put them in laundry baskets if I left then out and was just about as dignified as can be.   They all have there own personalities. I have seen litters from good breeders be killing machines and half derp more then a few times. Even with the same time with mom."

mainecoons,31w6a1,DoublePlusMeh,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:32:31 2015 UTC,"Both of mine have been of above average intelligence for a cat. Though, as with any breed, it probably varies with individual."
mainecoons,31w6a1,nionvox,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:26:22 2015 UTC,"Cats learn from other cats in a big way, and if other cats aren't around or are disinterested, they learn from their people. If their people can't be around 24/7 to teach them the same way a mommy cat would, you're going to end up with a derpy kitty. You can however still teach her, as long as she's bonded to you. Take on the role of mommy cat, and ""show"" her things the way a mommy would. For example, if she's sitting at the door and can't figure out if the screen is open or not, sit next to her and put your hand out to check. Then do the same with her paw. For this though, keep in mind most animals can't see a screen so even dogs will run right into it.  Our coons will chase mice and play with them, but not kill them (intentionally). I remember Dante would chase it, pick it up and growl at everyone while he had it, then drop it and pat it to make it run, and do it all again. He literally would play with it to death. That said, most cats don't learn how to mouse if they're not taught by other cats or hungry. The best way to get a good mouser is to give the kitty just barely not enough food, because then the hunt instinct kicks in. I don't want you to starve her though, so if she's still just not interested in mice then that may be her personality, and no amount of hunger will change her.  The family issue is just one of social stimulation. Some kitties don't like a lot of family and noise, others thrive on it, they're just like people in that regard. Her hiding may be because she's an ""introvert"", or maybe she's just not comfortable with every member of the family and she's only bonded to one or two people. It could be any number of things really, but loving her lots and as frequently as you can will help her."
mainecoons,31w6a1,turtree,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"WRT the mouser thing: ah, that makes sense.  Jamocha was a wheel well kitty (found on someone's tire).  He probably grew up having to hunt for his food.  That explains the stand offishness and his supreme hunting skills."
mainecoons,31w6a1,somethingratherother,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely does! We have two coons and a barn kitty, and goodness do their personalities differ. Nutmeg and Babboo (he has many names but that one is my favorite) are both very loving but have no interest in mice or hunting. They love to play and lick noses, and that's about it. Ronin, the barn kitty, only wants to be outside and can be gone for whole days at a time just prowling, hunting, and doing whatever else he does. He doesn't socialize with the other cats, and when he plays he seems to have more interest in the dog because his farm had lots of dogs. We rescued him because he was chasing the chickens and the farmer wasn't having any of that, and now that he's a part of our family he just hunts and hunts and hunts.   Upbringing has sooo much to do with a kitty's personality, so it doesn't surprise me that Jamocha (that is the best name, btw) is a hunter and quite a bit less social. However even hunters can be loves, as long as you give him affection whenever you can and at his pace =)"

We adopted her soon after her rescue and I have to say, she is one of the least intelligent cats I have owned, but she does have her moments of brilliance. She is also very touchy...does not like being petted by anyone she does not know, is afraid of the outdoors and on alert a lot, and growls when anyone knocks on the door or rings the door bell, heh. She is not too lovey with even those of us in the family that she likes the most, but shows her affection by hanging around close to us and not growling or hissing, heh. She does sleep on me at night and used to sleep under my blankets, but after she had a nightmare one night and sank her fangs into my thumb, we don't allow that anymore."

If the cat is going to be alone for long portions of time, consider getting two cats. Maine Coons are more pack oriented than most cats.   Get a fountain type water bowl, especially if you have a male. Cats don't really have a thirst mechanism, and the running water helps attract their interest in drinking. Male cats in particular can have problems where their urine starts to crystallize and blocks their urethra(? Right word? Pee-pee hole anyway).   They will figure out what annoys you and will fuck with you. Be ready. It's actually hilarious. And annoying.   Stock up on lint rollers.   Buy upper tier dry food, and give wet food as occasional treats.   It's also fun to have a time, for me it's a little before I go to bed, to give them treats. All I do now is walk towards the kitchen saying ""What time is it? Is it time for yums?"", and I have two cats scrambling for position for their treats."

This helps prevent the kidney disease that a lot of cats get later on. Wet food brands such as Halo, Wellness, Natural Balance... etc. My cat goes insane over Natural Balance. Of course wet food is more expensive, so it's easier on the wallet to supplement with dry food. Check the ingredients and make sure meat is the first one listed!"

mainecoons,31l460,NeverCallMeFifi,2,Wed Apr 8 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Everything that's not nailed down is a potential cat toy. Sometimes they will just knock stuff down on purpose, for their own amusement, or to clear stuff out of their way. If you have any valuable ornaments, either glue them to the shelf or expect losses! Same goes for house plants. Cats like to chew and play with house plants so don't keep any toxic ones like lilies around your cat. Invest in a massive amount of lint rollers and keep one within reach in every room. A Neato or Roomba will also help control cat hair in your house. Cat body language is easy to master. You will quickly learn that a cat wagging it's tail does not mean it's happy and submissive, as with dogs. It means he's thinking about attacking... You, the toy, doesn't matter. The faster he thrashes his tail, the more imminent the danger. Then there's the butt-wiggle, often accompanied by massive aperture of the eyes. If you can see the eyes, this means you are about to be attacked. If a cat rolls over all cute and presents the belly, don't assume this is an invitation to rub the belly. You may lose a hand. Ears back is a defensive sign, means leave kitty alone. One ear back can mean insecurity/uncertainty. Signs your cat likes you- if it grooms you. If it follows you around. If it invites you to play. If it headbutts you, purring. If it curls up to sleep near you, or on top of you. And even sometimes if it bites you! (Usually gently. These are called Love Bites, fairly common among cats.)"
mainecoons,31l460,mcguirl2,2,Tue Apr 7 07:57:24 2015 UTC,"My breeder, while socializing my kittens, taught them the concept of ""ow"".  When they got too rough playing or bitey, she'd say ""OW!"" and gently correct their behavior.  It works great with my two - now 18 months old and huge.  When they get too rowdy playing with me, I can just say ""ow"" and they retract claws and back off a bit. :)"
mainecoons,31l460,DancesWithElectrons,3,Tue Apr 7 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"I'd say you are in luck by getting a Maine Coon after having grown up with dogs. They are generally very personable as compared to other ""normal"" short haired cats and are known for their friendly, almost dog like interest in their human. However, as goes with most cats, and the Maine Coon my girlfriend adopted, there is a bit of a break in period where they adjust to their surroundings more than they focus their attention on you.   Be patient and calm around your new family member, unlike dogs, a cat is far more wary of loud noises, sudden movements and is not as excited about being petted aggressively like a dog would. In particular, some cats will be okay with being petted in only certain parts of their bodies, which is standard. I only emphasize this because of your perceived lack of experience with cats. They are wonderful and loving creatures, but just not as rambunctious as the dogs you are used to.  And finally, googling cat care and referencing reputable sites/books that are backed up by good organizations and reviews is a great start as compared to gathering all the minute details through a forum like this. However, I really cannot understate the value of a good set of brushes to help your cat out and keep less fur from building up in your apartment. Besides the garden variety brush to help keep after shedding, we have and strongly recommend having a de-matting comb on hand should your absurdly furry feline get knots in its fur. It's infinitely easier than scissors and safer because of the guarded sharp edges that cut through he mats. We have this one: http://www.amazon.com/MIU-COLOR-Professional-Undercoat-Dematting/dp/B00DDKQRLU  Edit: grammar and expanded note on petting advice"
mainecoons,31l460,DippStarr,2,Mon Apr 6 03:43:38 2015 UTC,The key to not getting mats in the fur is regular brushing.  It's a lot easier to slide a comb behind the knot and trim it out with scissors rather than relying on a brush like that - they really can do some damage to the coat if used incorrectly.  Waiting until there's a mat in the fur is not a good idea!  Get a daily or every other day routine going where you brush and give a treat or two and you should have no issues.

mainecoons,31dxmi,gingninj,3,Sat Apr 4 15:03:25 2015 UTC,"Hello! I have two Maine Coon boys and indeed it is very hard to say definitely how big the kitten will get. However, let me tell you what steps my family took to ensure we get the best and potentially very large cat.  First of all - the breeder - visit two or three to get the feel and see the environment where the cats live. We live in the UK and saw 3 breeders before we got the right one. It's incredibly important to see the home environment and see the breeders in action - how they treat the cats, what the conditions are, do the cats feel comfortable and safe, etc.  You should be able to see at least one parent - typically the mother, sometimes both. I was lucky to see both - male was kept separately - it was truly breathtaking breeding boy. Of course, if both mum and dad are big - there is a high chance your kitten will be big. Boys are generally much bigger - that is why I have two :)  Usually (not always) if there are fewer kittens in the litter, there is a higher chance of them getting bigger, because they had far more resources for themselves. In our case - Leon, the brown tabby with white, was one of just two kittens in the litter. At the moment he is 1.5 years old, measures just little over 39 inches and weighs 15.4 lbs. He will still grow, although not as fast. Coons reach top length and weight at about 4 years old, so we still have some growth to go :)   Food - this matters a lot. Get the best quality high meat content food possible. No human food whatsoever (direct advice from top UK breeders). Do your own research - check what are the best types of food, ask the reputable breeders about it. - I found out that vast majority of the breeders are incredibly helpful and supportive for potential customers and they will provide advice regardless of whether you will buy the cat from them or not.   I also found out based on my two boys that neutering did not do anything whatsoever to their growth and development. They are both as active as before, eat the same amount of food and are very playful.   It's a bit like having two toddlers all the time (2.5 and 1.5 years old :) - good luck with the kitten search! It's worth it!"

mainecoons,31570b,BKLounge,2,Fri Apr 3 02:46:26 2015 UTC,I can teach you.

mainecoons,314ta9,greenighs,2,Thu Apr 2 00:22:58 2015 UTC,My cat crawls into the over night bag. He says nope!
mainecoons,314ta9,jimIII,2,Thu Apr 2 01:13:04 2015 UTC,The look of a king!
mainecoons,314ta9,gingninj,1 point,Thu Apr 2 11:52:28 2015 UTC,What a face.
mainecoons,314ta9,javoss88,1 point,Thu Apr 2 05:27:58 2015 UTC,He dares you to try and use those suitcases.
mainecoons,314ta9,Inkpress00,1 point,Thu Apr 2 06:51:51 2015 UTC,What is it about cats and insisting that suitcases stay put?
mainecoons,312s8q,Macleodad,14,Wed Apr 1 16:53:28 2015 UTC,A couple more... http://imgur.com/gallery/pFypk
mainecoons,312s8q,greenighs,8,Wed Apr 1 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"He's 24+ lbs... doesn't like the vet office too much, so we have to weigh him in his carrier..."
mainecoons,312s8q,greenighs,2,Wed Apr 1 17:07:28 2015 UTC,One of the vets at the practice I go is afraid of Gizmo. Literally won't touch him unless the (teen) assistants hold him down. SMH.
mainecoons,312s8q,beccamarieb,3,Wed Apr 1 19:07:45 2015 UTC,Moxie is the perfect name for a Maine Maine Coon. :)

mainecoons,312s8q,theneen,3,Thu Apr 2 11:39:06 2015 UTC,!!!
mainecoons,312s8q,Minn4theWin,3,Wed Apr 1 23:45:38 2015 UTC,He is absolutely gorgeous! Thanks for posting. Give Moxie a head-butt from my MC Ruby-girl!
mainecoons,312s8q,Minn4theWin,3,Thu Apr 2 03:38:08 2015 UTC,So great... he loves giving headbutts!
mainecoons,312s8q,SLewis234489,3,Thu Apr 2 11:37:43 2015 UTC,His floof is magnificent. ♡
mainecoons,312s8q,Minn4theWin,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:32:58 2015 UTC,"Magnificent is not usually the word I would use, because he's such a doofus... but Thanks!! haha"
mainecoons,312s8q,zero44,5,Thu Apr 2 11:38:29 2015 UTC,Holy fuck what a large cat. He's beautiful. Does he take up your entire bed at night?
mainecoons,3130fp,Macleodad,5,Wed Apr 1 17:38:50 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, he is HUGE"
mainecoons,3130fp,McScoopenstein,5,Wed Apr 1 23:27:02 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever seen a house cat that is not fat be so big.
mainecoons,3130fp,Shark_Bait_Buddy,3,Thu Apr 2 00:13:37 2015 UTC,"He is pretty large... a bit fat, but not too bad. He doesn't actually eat all that much compared to our other cat who is a Himalayan!"
mainecoons,3130fp,Shark_Bait_Buddy,1 point,Thu Apr 2 11:41:04 2015 UTC,"Those are some felines with serious personalities, they must keep you entertained."
mainecoons,3130fp,yepright,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"They are pretty funny... The Himalayan is a girl (9lbs), and she's not as outgoing, but I am growing on her. She purrs like a 65 year old lifetime smoker when I pet her, but she only likes being pet when she is on a specific bed in the house. Too cute."
mainecoons,312rit,feeetlips,3,Wed Apr 1 16:49:26 2015 UTC,"""Don't hate me because I'm beautiful."""

mainecoons,311o3q,nionvox,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:27:01 2015 UTC,I require neck snorgles. FUZZEH.
mainecoons,311o3q,ccbbb23,2,Wed Apr 1 19:02:45 2015 UTC,The Queen permits snorgles only between the hour of 6am - 7am and 1pm - 2pm

mainecoons,30zon9,upnorthhickchick,2,Wed Apr 1 10:59:35 2015 UTC,"Hahaa, crazy...I love in RGD where the mod was all like, prove they're yours or we'll come to your house with torches and pitchforks and ban you from RGD for life!  But I'm not still bitter or anything..."
mainecoons,30zon9,Atari1977,2,Wed Apr 1 11:38:33 2015 UTC,Wow. Two of those handsome boys.
mainecoons,30zon9,Da60,2,Wed Apr 1 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"Thank youuu, but the one on the left is a total dick. I just thought everyone should know."
mainecoons,30ysut,ttdpaco,9,Tue Mar 31 20:18:18 2015 UTC,"This little guy adopted us when he wondered on our porch one night. After weeks of looking for the owner, we found out that he was a kitten from a maine coon breeder that use to live near my wife. I made several attempts to get into contact with them through facebook and the email they had on their website, as they were still relatively close to the town. However, they refused to get back to us. My wife's neighbor told us why: (forewarning, this is Southern Indiana, so they're use to leaving animals outside) they kept their cats outside as mousers, but made sure their females were only impregnated by their one male. However, they were trying to breed for specific traits, so any kitten that didn't have those traits was kept outside as a mouser to fend for themselves while the kittens they were selling were kept inside. So this little guy had been outside by himself since a very young age, and was being fed by one neighbor who felt bad, but didn't bother to bring him to the shelters (as they were full and most were kill shelters.) So I got him neutered, gave him shots, food and a home. He's a happy kitten now."
mainecoons,30ysut,DancesWithElectrons,4,Tue Mar 31 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"In about 6-8 months, he's not gonna fit in that sink :)"
mainecoons,30ysut,talldrinkofbaileys,4,Tue Mar 31 22:21:30 2015 UTC,"Haha, very true. In January, when I adopted him, he was about 6 months old and already 11.5 lbs. Keep in mind, he was a very thin cat around that time (as he wasn't well fed until I got him) so that was pretty heavy considering.  Edit: Happy Cake day btw!"
mainecoons,3101b7,misshgolightly,3,Wed Apr 1 01:40:03 2015 UTC,He definitely has the muzzle and ear tufts :]
mainecoons,3101b7,Omariamariaaa,2,Wed Apr 1 16:09:26 2015 UTC,No doubt
mainecoons,30zw8w,ThrowGoToGo,3,Wed Apr 1 01:02:44 2015 UTC,"My cats don't really sit on my lap that much. One of them does. I don't think Maine Coons are known for being lap cats. But they sure love to cuddle.  So to answer your question, no they are probably not going be on top of you constantly. How hot are they temperature-wise? I have no idea, you'd have to ask them."
mainecoons,30zw8w,garnetgirlie,2,Wed Apr 1 04:00:43 2015 UTC,"My cat used to like sitting on my lap when I was on the computer (until I decided to get up), which could be for an hour or two.  How easy do you sweat? You will definitely be able to tell that your lap is mildly warm.  He was exactly this fluffy and 17lbs: http://i.imgur.com/qBZYEsz.jpg"
mainecoons,30zw8w,manifest3r,2,Wed Apr 1 04:51:19 2015 UTC,"My Nemo doesn't really like sitting on my lap more than the occasional snooze when I'm at the computer. He prefers sleeping next to me on a chair or in bed. He loves to cuddle in the mornings and at bedtime though.  From what I've noticed his body temperature seems to be slightly higher than the cats I'm used to, but it might be a kitten thing I don't know. He's 18 weeks today. And the fur of a fluffy cat does warm you up a bit."
mainecoons,30zqrh,madeofhay,2,Wed Apr 1 00:22:57 2015 UTC,"She'll be 3 on May 1st. She weighs 14 lbs, loves to play fetch and go for walks, and watch me cross stitch."
mainecoons,30qszk,pen1246,2,Sun Mar 29 22:32:07 2015 UTC,"my 10 month female is 10 lbs! If you want reference:  http://imgur.com/IRLnIX2  MC's don't stop growing until 3 years, a big spurt after the 1st year is what I hear as stated above-"
mainecoons,30qszk,cboike86,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:28:47 2015 UTC,"What a beauty. The sites and mags say they have a growth cycle after their first years. I know our boy and girl started to thicken, not fat, about year 3 or 4: I think I am remembering right."

Dope lyyfee.
