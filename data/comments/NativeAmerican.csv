I've found language to be very valuable and insightful. It's can be tricky if your language is moribund or extinct though and there are few obvious resources. What's the status on your language? Are there still speakers around in your nation you're able to immerse with?

NativeAmerican,3d1noh,Jcorb,29,Sun Jul 12 20:07:21 2015 UTC,"Yours is a common concern: You may or may not have an indian ancestor back a long time ago, but you don't even know what tribe, region or language family they are from.  This is a serious problem since our nations vary widely. There is no such thing as a generic general purpose indian nation.  The US feds currently recognize 567 tribes. Some of these overlap historically, being descended from one nation historically. Other nations are not represented at all. Nations from Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Columbia, Bolivia, etc, are not acknowledged as indians under the federal tribe perspective. But the point is, there are hundreds, almost certainly thousands, and possibly tens of thousands of different nations, each with their own culture and stories and histories and ancestors. Among these are hundreds of languages, at least dozens of language families, and many language isolates unrelated to any other, going back to the dawn of time.  So you either pick one at random, or by ""feels"", or you create some sort of  syncretic composite indian, borrowing here and there from stuff you think seems cool. OK, but what have you accomplished by that? Well you've probably offended quite a few people by appropriating their private beliefs. In general, indian nations are not evangelical and do not seek to impose our beliefs or cultures on others.  Now there are 100% blood indians who are in the shoes of not knowing their own tribe. These are truly tragic cases, indians stolen from their families, forcibly raised by whites, and they become adults and do not know their parents, or in some cases even their tribes. Some of these people commit suicide. Are you suicidal? Probably not, so you are not in the shoes of the people who have been kidnapped and abused.  You have a distant connection and no idea what it is.  There is nothing wrong with this.  But you can not legitimately be in a tribe if you don't know anything about it and have no known connection. If you really want to participate deeply in a tribe, you could consider committing to a native spouse, learning fluently the language of your spouse's people, raising your children to know their language as a first language, and helping your spouse's people.  If you want to support native people in general, consider if you are really capable of doing so. One might ask in this case if they consider the US to be the greatest country in the world, if the US military is legitimate, if Jesus Christ is their Lord and Savior, if native peoples are pagan infidels in need of salvation, and if the Doctrine of Discovery is a legitimate legal principle that gives the US valid title to any land whatsoever.  Where does your heart and identity really lay?  If the ancient DNA and ancestral spirits really are there trying to connect, to speak, to break forth, the answers to these questions will become clear.  Even without a tribe, it is possible to support all native peoples of turtle island, north, central and south, regardless of viewpoint of colonialist governments and their sympathizers. Read original accounts. Donate to causes. Visit and learn and never dictate or claim that you have the answers. Perhaps you will marry into a tribe in Venezuela or Ecuador and your children will speak the language of your spouse. Who knows."
NativeAmerican,3d1noh,DrakeBishoff,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:33:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've struggled with thoughts of suicide since I was probably 14 (I'm 27 now). Very different circumstances, obviously, but I've definitely had a lot of hardships of my own. Really, though, I don't think I would ever expect to be ""a legitimate member of a tribe"", because as you say, I was born and raised with zero connection, other than maybe some kind of blood lineage.  I guess for me, I just spend a lot of time thinking about, what would my forefathers have wanted for me? The only person who ever really gave a shit about me was my grandpa -- ironically, who I had no blood connection with, but because he never had children of his own, he treated me better than any of my actual family. I think about him quite often, if I'm the kind of person he'd have wanted me to be, what are the sorts of things he thought were important... He passed when I was still fairly young, and I never had a chance to learn the things he valued.  I think, in a way, that's why I want to connect more with... well, whoever I'm descended from. I have red hair, but I have no idea if my blood is Irish, Scottish, or something else entirely, especially since I've heard several times that ""I look like I have something else in me"". I heard my great-grandmother was a Native American, and I guess it was just kind of the first thing I latched onto. Those questions I wish I could have asked my grandfather, I guess my hope is that maybe I'm descended from something more than the lazy, cruel drug-addicts that I grew up with.  I mean, I know that probably sounds silly, and maybe even a bit juvenile. I just feel like there's something, I dunno, ""missing""."
NativeAmerican,3d1noh,iskandarios,2,Mon Jul 13 14:19:44 2015 UTC,"Also it's very common among settlers (I am a settler) to have fabricated tales of having at least a ""dash"" of indigenous ancestry to ""spice up"" our family trees, or sometimes people do it to try to get undeserved access to tribal resources, or sometimes to help themselves cope with white guilt.  I heard similar rumors about my own heritage which I followed up on and it was just made-up, everyone in my bloodline is of European heritage. Someone, somewhere in the family made up the story. It happened in my settler family, it can happen in yours, too. The historical reasons why settlers started doing this/continue to do this are ugly, it's not good to do, and if you have any ability to get your heritage checked out, please get your heritage checked out before claiming indigenous heritage.  EDIT this is not at all to conclude that you don't have heritage, I just want to caution you that false claims of indigenous heritage are real and common among settlers and the only way to know is to get down to brass tacks and do the research. Sounds like this could be a good time to get started on it."

You and I sound very alike, do some exploring of your lineage, and if you can't pinpoint what's in you're blood then don't even worry about that. If a tribe won't accept an outsider who wants to be taught a new culture then that's a tribe you wouldn't even want to be apart of in all honesty. And frankly some tribes are borderline racist with the way they hold grudges against 'the white man' but they don't understand that white men alive today aren't responsible for any of that nonsense. And if we had the choice to travel back in time we'd defend the rights of Native Americans...but honestly find a tribe local to you that peaks your interest and go for it. We're all humans and we all share the same roots regardless of what any religion may tell you."

I don't want to make too many assumptions about you or your life, because I don't know you and I couldn't do such a thing, but in my eyes it appears that you're looking for a familial connection to anything. It may seem to you if you just dug down deep enough you could find that you're 1/100th of some nation, even though you can't really trace it, you don't know anything about the culture, and you do't resemble the people in any phenotypical way, that joining those people who are present day members will bring you some sort of closure or happiness. I can almost assure you it will not. You need to take a good hard look inside yourself and find out what you like about you. Do some soul searching, try a hobby, quit your job, travel the world. Do what will make you happy, and demand that joy from your every day life. That is what will fill your hole, not appropriating into a culture that is not your own."
NativeAmerican,3d1noh,thefloorisbaklava,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:57:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe you're right. I suppose I hadn't considered it, but I can definitely see some truth in that comparison.  I guess that's just kind of the problem; there really is no ""white culture"". It's not even a melting-pot, really; it's just a society of making money to pay bills and taxes. But you may be right; I wasn't raised in that culture, so maybe it's unfair of me to want to be a part of it.  In any case, I appreciate your insight."
NativeAmerican,3d1noh,HotterRod,9,Mon Jul 13 16:11:49 2015 UTC,"there really is no ""white culture"".   Well, no (a long time ago I had a co-worked that insisted on having a White Studies degree at University of California, Berkeley), but just go down one level, from ""white"" to Germanic, Celtic, Iberian, Slavic, Scandinavian, etc. and there are a wealth of cultures, that European descendants have carried over the United States."
NativeAmerican,3d1noh,DrakeBishoff,5,Mon Jul 13 16:40:09 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar position: my great-grandfather was financially successful in the white man's world and dropped his ties to his culture. His son married a white woman, and his son also married a white woman and had me.  The fact that in order to be financially successful/enjoy the fruits of that success my great-grandfather had to cast off his culture was the goal of cultural genocide. His son was no doubt encouraged to marry a white woman because it was seen as marrying up. And so the subtle social pressure I feel to identify as purely white is part of the ongoing practice of cultural genocide that bleaches part-native people in positions of success and power.  That being said, I have no cultural connection to my great-grandfather's nation so I feel it would be illegitimate for me to use my genetics to give me privilege over purely white people. Toward native people I mostly act the same as good white allies, appreciating the culture as one equally as rich and no more foreign or exotic than the one I was raised in. Toward white people I identify as an assimilated native in order to demonstrate the diversity of cultural practice."

NativeAmerican,3d1noh,powerfulndn,4,Mon Jul 13 04:12:57 2015 UTC,"DNA tests don't really mean anything. I would find a genealogist. There's nothing wrong with trying to learn more about your family. There are no federally recognized tribes in Georgia (and none in the last century) but plenty in Michigan. With no birth records for your grandmother, there is no possibility of obtaining and CDIB or enrolling in a tribe. There's nothing wrong with being a non-Native that wants to learn more about Native culture and volunteering in your local Native community."
NativeAmerican,3d1noh,notaw,2,Mon Jul 13 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"Look into your immediate family history and make the connection there. All people came from tribes, whites included. White culture doesn't exist because it was created to disassociate people from their ancestor's traditions in exchange for racial privilege. It's good that you want to learn and that you posted this here. Many white people don't even bother to consider the fact that 'connecting with' their distant Native grandmother (who was often Cherokee and a princess lol) could be offensive. I commend you for your self reflection and desire to connect with your ancestry.   People tend to want to connect with their 'native heritage' because it seems 'authentic.' The real problem is that many white people don't have knowledge of or connections to their own family heritage to they look for groups of people who seem to have that. Don't buy the hype. Authenticity doesn't exist and we as Natives are certainly as insecure about our identities as anyone else, just in different ways.   That said, there is nothing the prevents you from getting involved with Indians as a white person. In fact, many people who work to better native communities though tribal governments, non-profits, housing authorities, etc. are white. Just make sure to ALWAYS be very conscious of appropriating traditions and always be wary of rainbow warriors...those fools are wack. Finally, it always helps to learn about the Native people where you live. Do research. Go to the tribal offices. Go to pow wows or local tribal events that are open to the community. Volunteer on the rez or in the schools. Natives often have a way of bringing people into the fold who are good to them and it doesn't matter what your race is.

Some are very receptive to anyone with native blood.  I will say that, to me, having a CDIB makes all the difference.  I meet tons of people who claim to be native ; no CDIB, no tribal ties, just a claim that somewhere in their family tree there is an Indian somewhere (usually Cherokee). My advice would be to do your research and identify your tribal ethnicity.  Once you have that, find out what the tribal requirements are.  You can then apply for tribal membership and your CDIB through the department of the interior. Then go to tribal events; network.  You can research on your own to familiarize yourself with the history of your people.  I have a ton of books covering my tribe specifically and most native peoples.  Be active in your community.  Don't sweat it about how much Indian you are.  Some will be dicks because they are FBIs, but your going to run into that shit all over.  Some places your looked down on for being Indian.

As far as I could tell you, nobody existed in my family before my grandparents, and my family on both sides were awful, cruel people to my sister and I, save for my grandpa (ironically, who wasn't actually related by blood, as he never had kids).  I guess my hope with all of this, is that maybe I'm descended from something more than just ""trailer trash"". I've always envied those who have some kind of understanding of their background, who have a sense of culture, and ""who they are"". At best, I could guess what my ancestry is, simply because I have red hair, but since nobody else in my family does, even that's kind of a wash.  As far as finding out what tribe I might be descended from, I'm not even sure whether my great-grandmother was from Michigan or Georgia, or what her name would have been. I don't know, is there a way you can have a blood-test done, just to get an idea of where you ancestry might have come from?"

If your grandmother wasn't listed on a tribe's rolls, then none of her descendants would be eligible either.

We do not follow domination theologies and have a long record of better environmental respect for our own lands than those who killed us, who took our things, and who to this day continue to illegally occupy our lands. We are better stewards of our lands than the settlers, in addition these are our eternally unceded lands.  Forgiveness is a Euro-Christian concept and historically has been used to oppress people by positioning damage from atrocities as being the fault of the victims, who are supposed to forgive those who have harmed them, while the oppressors are presumed entitled to retain the spoils of their plunder and criminality. This theology I consider highly offensive and intrinsically oppressive.  However the authoritarian demand for forgiveness is possibly better than the ongoing and continual demands that ""that all happened a long time ago"" and ""I never personally killed an indian"" that are the go-to claims of white racist settlers. So it can be seen as an improvement, though ultimately an inconsequential one.  There has been talk of rescinding the Doctrine of Discovery. The Catholic church has already claimed that this Doctrine of Discovery was rescinded centuries ago. Yet colonialist countries such as the US consider their land holdings that follow from this supposedly rescinded doctrine to be legitimate and eternally binding principles.  If the Vatican really believes they don't support the Doctrine of Discovery, let them publicly call for the return of all indigenous lands that were stolen, and to excommunicate as a matter of their church doctrine all members who refuse to work to this end.  Until our land is returned none of these empty proclamations should be taken seriously, but should rather consider to be deeply offensive insults from genocidal criminals hellbent on keeping their ill-gotten wealth and privilege, all earned by them not by honest labor or history but by the desecration of the the blood and bodies and land of our ancestors."

NativeAmerican,3ct82p,bobjr94,2,Fri Jul 10 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"I read the BIA decision on this earlier. I've read a bunch of these decisions over the years. The federal criteria of indianness and particularly the way it is interpreted are colonialist, inconsistent with traditional identity and structure of many tribes, have worked to shift tribal governments to patriarchal authoritarian governments based on western ideas, informed by ignorant racist anthropological ideas, favor tribes that gave up their lands to whites and submitted rather than resisted, and have little to do with indian identity.  There are outspoken activists and columnists who for the most part only accept these federal tribes as true indians, and who thus consider non-federal indians, such as latin american tribes, Canadian tribes, Connecticut tribes, Virginia tribes, the Seattle Duwamish, and, until last week the Pamunkey, as fakes and wannabees. These assertions and these federal definitions come from a racist, patriarchal, authoritarian, colonialist framework which harms indians and is working to destroy indian identity and traditional culture.  I find these BIA judgements to be infuriating and depressing to read. I was working on summarizing some of the fallacies and problems with these, but it was too depressing. Fortunately the OP's link has a link to another article where someone put together an excellent summary of several points regarding this ""final determination"", so I'll just provide a link to that.  http://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2015/07/07/22506907/duwamish-tribe-vows-to-keep-fighting-for-recognition-despite-last-weeks-decision"

NativeAmerican,3bnaxx,clark1409,2,Tue Jun 30 16:24:23 2015 UTC,"For Cherokees, there are presently three federally recognized tribes. Each has their own membership criteria.  The largest tribe, Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, has the most permissive and easy to establish citizenship requirements. One must simply document, using solid criteria such as birth certificates, that they are descended from someone on the Dawes Rolls, which were finalized in 1907. So-called ""blood quantum"" is not a factor in membership, only descent. If the tribe you believe you are related to is this tribe and your grandmother or great-grandmother is on this roll, then you are good to go. If not, there is nothing you can do about it. This nation is comprised of descendants of persons who were relocated to Oklahoma during the years 1836 through 1839 following the Indian Removal Act of 1830, and who were affiliated with Chief John Ross was a 7/8 white Indian agent raised by white parents who had advocated assimilation, abandonment of traditional ways, white dress, and plantation farming using slaves. His understanding was that by adopting white ways of slavery and christianity, a philosophy the white government called ""civilizing the indian"", they would be allowed to stay in their lands. This proved not to be the case.  This relocation process began with a census of all Cherokees that could be found in several states in order to make a list for removal, followed by a period of voluntary removal, then by a forced removal at gunpoint during a march called the Trail of Tears, during which many died.  There are also the other two federally recognized tribes. The United Keetoowah Band in Oklahoma, and the Eastern Cherokee of North Carolina.  The United Keetoowah Band were Cherokee traditionalists who did not adopt white ways. Under the Treaty of 1828 they moved to Indian Territory voluntarily. If your ancestor did not move to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) around 1828, you are not a member of this band. In general you would not be a member of the Keetoowah Band and not already be aware of it.  The Eastern Cherokee were a group of traditionals who refused to relocate. They stayed behind in North Carolina in hiding, and were eventually able, through an adopted white chief, to purchase traditional lands, and eventually create a corporate structure for the tribal government. At the time it was prohibited for indians to purchase land in the area, even their own lands. For the Eastern Cherokee, you can apply to be a member if your ancestor appears on the 1924 Baker Roll of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians AND you are 1/16 blood quantum, which you are exactly if it proves to be true your great-grandmother was half. This would mean you would be eligible, but not your children, unless your spouse was also a citizen. But only if your ancestor appears in the Roll and is confirmed to be half by quanta.  There are a number of other cherokee tribes around, both state recognized, and otherwise. Some cases of claimed state recognition are questionable, a tribe may claim to be state recognized because the state issued a proclamation acknowledging a tribe or its culture in some way, but generally the process of formal state recognition is more formal.  In general federally recognized tribal members believe all non-federal cherokee tribes to be comprised of fake indians, wannabees and in some cases ""descendants"" with no presumed right (some claim) to even identify publicly or privately as indian. It may or may not be the case that all of these tribes consist only of white people. There are many reports of indians staying behind during relocation, escaping from marches, hiding in the hills, and even identifying as white if they could pass. Or being labelled as ""colored"" if they could not pass. One notable example of ""secretly stayed behind"" is the Eastern Band are obviously real Cherokees even though they did not go on the relocation march, and now are a federally recognized tribe. Others stayed behind as well and somehow survived, and in some cases claim to have performed ceremonies and keep identity in private. The Eastern Cherokee are unlikely to have been the only band to refuse to relocate as there were many bands at the time that were not all accounted for during relocation. Some consider descendants of these people who have unassailable proof of descent to be persons with indian ancestry, but claim they are not true indians for various reasons, such as if they did not prominently maintain tribal identity in public (which would get them relocated), or if they failed to maintain at least 50% endogamy marriage within their own tribe, or other such factors, of which there seem to be an endless number. And of course we see on a daily basis that anyone without unassailable proof of descent in the form of white documentation stating they were indian is considered an ""ethnic fraud"" by enrolled indians regardless of the facts of the matter. In many cases though indians were reclassified as colored and indian categories not permitted on censuses. This is used in many denial rulings regarding tribes applying for state or federal status, and is affecting tribes in Connecticut and Virginia where the argument has been that no indians existed after a certain date, only coloreds, and therefore anyone claiming to be an indian now is a fake and not descended from a historical tribe. The Pamunkey received recognition this week after decades of work to be recognized, which used these arguments to counter their claims. Now they are considered real indians, and they are indeed so, but last week they were considered to be fake indians according to the state and many other tribes that fetishize federal recognition and CDIB cards. It's very interesting to observe how much the US federal government and BIA's opinions on these matter so much considering that both are genocidal organizations with a long history of total warfare against indians.  I wonder - are you the same person that posted here last month with a similar question but different user name also saying then your great-grandmother was 50% Cherokee? Were you able to do anything with the advice given at that time?  Do you consider yourself to be Cherokee? Or Indian in general? Why is that so? Do you speak, read, and/or write the Cherokee language? Were you raised in the culture by your parents? What ceremonial songs and dances do you know? What is your religion? Do you support the US military? Do you consider yourself to be an American citizen?"

I'm not the same person that posted a month ago, I actually just learned about my great grandmother about 2 weeks ago. I will look up that person's comments and see what I can do.   I have never considered myself to be Cherokee as I never knew I was, but I have become excited about it. I have been living in Tulsa for about 8 years now and with such a huge influence of Native American culture and heritage, it has been very educational. My fiance is Cherokee, i think she said something like 1/128th, but she and all her family have been involved in the culture her entire life.
