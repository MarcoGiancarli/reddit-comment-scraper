BroadCity,3dibeq,MetalWeirdo,10,Thu Jul 16 14:33:03 2015 UTC,I have a suspicion that it's Abbi.  They make jokes about her being an artist from time to time and the art that is shown off does have the styling of the opening animations. Specifically the art from the episode Kirk Steele when they try to sell it on the street.

BroadCity,34unr0,bannanabeat,3,Mon May 4 18:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yep. Haven't used one myself but I have heard great things about it, probably going to get one soon myself."
BroadCity,34unr0,fotografamerika,5,Mon May 4 18:42:25 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, there are way better vapes for your money. The Pax looks pretty and it produces okay vapour....when it works. It has a really hard draw resistance and it's known for being difficult to clean. Also loads of issues with the mouthpiece getting stuck inside the unit due to sticky residue."
BroadCity,34unr0,Twerkle-Belle,2,Mon May 4 21:47:48 2015 UTC,What would you recommend?
BroadCity,34unr0,fotografamerika,6,Tue May 5 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day it's all personal preference. It really depends what's most important to you - portability or good vapor?  If portability is your main concern, the Pax is really small and discreet and it looks pretty unassuming. It just has a lot of draw resistance and it's high maintenance, plus I personally find the draws get a bit hotter/harsher than what I like. I haven't had a chance to try the Pax 2 yet but it has a few improvements.  Otherwise, the Crafty isn't that much bigger than the Pax and it has superb vapor quality and is really low maintenance. It doesn't have great battery life though.   If that's out of your price range, look into the Arizer Solo or the new Arizer Air. I own a Solo and it is by far my favourite vaporizer that I've tried, the Air produces pretty much the same results but it's smaller and a little hotter to draw from.  I also own an MFLB which I do really love. Super tiny and portable and uses external rechargeable batteries. Has a bit of a learning curve but once you perfect it, you can get some very nice hits."

BroadCity,34unr0,fotografamerika,2,Tue May 5 04:13:41 2015 UTC,"Get an at home vape, coolest one i've used is the vapexhale. Volcano is rad too. How often are you smoking out and about? I mostly smoke before going out and might smoke a little while out but at that point a bowl or joint or vape pen with oil makes more sense. Loading and waiting for your pax or other vape to heat up is just silly and time consuming for such a small amount of pot that you really can't even share with anyone. I've owned multiple portable and at home vapes. Its true the pax needs constant maintenance"

BroadCity,34unr0,Tannhauserr,1 point,Thu May 7 20:56:56 2015 UTC,The pax isn't that bad. The pax 2 is WAY better on all fronts though. /r/ploompax
BroadCity,34unr0,BroMatterhorn,1 point,Tue May 5 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"Pax owner here. None of these issues are game-changers. The unit comes with mouthpiece lubricant that prevents stickiness. If you clean it after every 6-10 uses, a process that takes about 5 minutes with rubbing alcohol and supplied pipe cleaners, you'll be set. And I don't find it hard to pull vapor out of it. I also own an Arizer vape and I get much higher from the Pax."

BroadCity,34unr0,Unicorn-Slut,2,Tue May 5 02:26:28 2015 UTC,"pax but honestly spend your money on another vape.  It heats up incredibly fast and makes holding it uncomfortable. It is too much work to inhale through its little spout. I've said this exact same thing on another thread here in /broadcity about the same vape. I stand by my word, go with something else. It looks pretty, that's about it."

BroadCity,34unr0,tuttutter,1 point,Mon May 4 21:45:41 2015 UTC,"The oven has to be fully stuffed with weed, otherwise you get the heating issue. Underpacking = overheating. As for inhaling, I think it's fine. Haven't tried the second generation model; maybe that is better?"
BroadCity,34unr0,tuttutter,2,Tue May 5 12:51:23 2015 UTC,"yeah the packing is where it's at. to get a solid session out of it, it has to be pretty tight. and i like to make it even more dense with some wax or hash in the middle of the flowers. but like most others here i don't have experience with the PAX 2 yet, but i def recommend the PAX."

Their episodes have been consistently among the best in the series (Working Girls, Coat Check, Knockoffs), and they have a really unique comic sensibility. The producers of the Jump Street movies gave Phil Lord and Chris Miller the freedom to express their creative voices in the ways that they wanted, and the success of the movies gave them the clout to kind of do whatever they want from here on out. Both could very easily happen with a new movie in the series from Aniello and Downs."

BroadCity,325sas,IrishPub,-13,Fri Apr 10 20:53:23 2015 UTC,I was surprised not to see him again this season. I guess this isn't a show where characters mature or learn lessons or anything—like many of its biggest influences—but to have Abbi's association with him end like that is out of character for such a progressive show.
BroadCity,325sas,chekhovscricketbat,13,Fri Apr 10 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"yeah i think people are expecting there to be ""lessons"" learned and that isn't what I think the show is really about. they're two ""average"" girls living in nyc, experiencing basic (albeit entertainingly dramatized) social situations. from personal experience, if i have a supremely awkward sexual experience with a guy, I'm not going to make it a huge part of my life to learn from it and try to philosophically work something out. it was a weird, slightly gross and embarrassing hookup. i certainly wouldn't try to rustle that up any more and I would most definitely not try to engage in some deep conversation if i saw him in the hallway."

It's not about having a deep conversation, it's just weird that the character hasn't even been mentioned since.  And from Jeremy's perspective it's implausible he wouldn't reach out at all. A simple line to the effect of, oh shit, Jeremy texted... delete delete delete..., would go a long way. If she's avoiding him, let us know that."
BroadCity,325sas,chekhovscricketbat,4,Fri Apr 10 22:52:29 2015 UTC,Eh I think they've invested enough time in her storyline with him. I'm sure he'll show up again.. he wasn't in every episode anyways to begin with. To each his own. Personally I'm more interested in the next guy they come up with for her!  Edit: also I doubt he would text her because SERIOUSLY how would she think she could just put anything but a SHINJO inside his body... Hehehe
BroadCity,325sas,katebdrawsthings,0,Sat Apr 11 01:02:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my criticisms are based on the idea that they may have ""killed Jeremy off""—if they bring it back in a future episode it's all good.

BroadCity,30m5c8,graduallemon,54,Sat Mar 28 17:18:29 2015 UTC,"I agree that some of the trans jokes were a little iffy, but they didn't bother me that much. I'm confused about the title, though. There's no homophobia in Broad City, for God's sake, Ilana had sex with a girl just a few episodes ago"
BroadCity,30m5c8,workingbarbie,17,Sat Mar 28 18:38:01 2015 UTC,"The show definitely has a different feel going from season one to season two. I feel like season one was more gritty and had more unconventional, one liner jokes (""Illana where did you get this pot?"" ""Its PCP"") whereas this season has more polished and carefully planned out jokes, a lot of them centered around social issues."
BroadCity,30m5c8,darkkite23,47,Sat Mar 28 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"One of the comments on the article made a fabulous point. No one said that these characters are perfect. Ilana has proven time and again that while her heart is in the right place, she doesn't always know what she is talking about and inadvertently says something offensive. I did not see the slavery and trans jokes as malicious. More, they reflect Abbi and Illana's imperfections. They are not discriminating against transpeople or making light of slavery, but sometimes they can say things that are a little iffy. Everyone says things that someone else can find offensive, no matter how accepting or open-minded they are. The author seems to forget that little fact."
BroadCity,30m5c8,szzza,17,Sat Mar 28 18:57:46 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. I want to add though I think it's a shame that others here are so quick to dismiss the author for being oversensitive or overanalysing. Given the (political) nature of the show (especially it's sneak-attack feminism - i mean it's right there in the sidebar) i think this kind of analysis and discourse is important - not necessarily right but important to be having. Anyway, I agree with everything you're saying and for my closing statement would like to quote Abbi to Ilana from S01E06 Stolen Phone:   “Sometimes, you’re so anti-racist that you’re actually really racist.”"
BroadCity,30m5c8,PercolatingFish,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:22:15 2015 UTC,"The WSJ calls the show sneak-attack feminism, but have Ilana and Abbi ever defined themselves and their show as such?  I'm really asking. I don't know."
BroadCity,30m5c8,szzza,4,Sun Mar 29 15:51:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure whether they have used that exact phrase - but if you read that WSJ article they quote Abbi:   That episode encapsulates the sneak-attack feminism of the series. “If you watch one of our episodes, there’s not a big message,” says Jacobson. “But if you watch all of them, I think, they’re empowering to women.”   Plus if you have any doubts about the feminist nature of the show you should check out this interview with Broad City and Sleater Kinney."
BroadCity,30m5c8,darkkite23,-1,Sun Mar 29 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"well, i think you can say ""this is offensive"" or ""this is not offensive"", but to say that it was put in as a display of an imperfection in her character, rather than a joke is a bit of a stretch, I think. Sure, real people have flaws, but this is a show that was written by real people"
BroadCity,30m5c8,Jammypotatoes,9,Sat Mar 28 19:24:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it was put as a ways to show an imperfection of character. It was a joke, certainly. But it reflects that the real people writing these jokes found them funny. I thought the slavery joke was hilarious, but I can see why some people would find it offensive. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. The writers tried something, and maybe it backfired. The author of the article is saying she's going to turn her back on a great show because of two jokes that took it a little too far, which is unfair. Everyone is going to make a mistake. Everyone is going to say something a little offensive. Even screenwriters."
BroadCity,30m5c8,shitcock55,4,Sat Mar 28 20:11:13 2015 UTC,"You have to be aware that you just judged the author as harsh as she judged the show. So be it, that she found those 2 jokes so bad that it turns her off from season 3. It's her opinion and it is an editorial, AND it's not like she's rallying for people to not watch season 3.  Yes we all love the show, but the author has a point! For such a progressive show those 2 jokes definitely marred what turned out otherwise to be a stellar sophomore effort.   Humor is subjective and I guarantee you there are people who found that ""joke"" about a black person singing slave songs absolutely NOT funny.   Far be it me to say this, but I think the point you are missing is that those ""mistakes"" to the author, is a portents of a possible downward spiral into tv mediocrity."

BroadCity,30m5c8,fapping_at_work,21,Sat Mar 28 19:48:35 2015 UTC,It makes me wonder if they're expecting too much from the show and also if those jokes are that offensive. I wasn't particularly offended by one of the ones somewhat aimed at me.
BroadCity,30m5c8,spectralconfetti,5,Sat Mar 28 18:22:00 2015 UTC,"What would've been a funny way to incorporate trans issues into the episode without making it transphobic? I'd like to hear that. The article isn't pointing out enough concrete examples for me to be convinced the show is homophobic, transphobic, or racist.  I would love to see Ilana in a more serious lesbian relationship, but I don't think the show is homophobic ."
BroadCity,30m5c8,tyronebiggums_5,15,Sat Mar 28 20:34:43 2015 UTC,"i didn't write the article, but I think their problem with the joke was probably that it's using trans people as a punchline in terms of it being ""a freaky thing to be into"". FWIW when I watched the episode I also thought it was a bit of a cheap shot/lazy joke. There's so much stuff in popular culture where someone liking trans people is essentially the punchline, and even if you don't find that offensive, it's still a bit lazy.   I'm not really sure of a better trans-related joke in that situation, but generally I think jokes are funnier if they're punching upwards, not downwards (i.e. attacking those in power).   I don't think the writers are homophobic or transphobic, I'm guessing no one really thought about it too much, but then again, that's kind of how most casual discrimination works. People have too black and white of a mentality about that kinda stuff if you ask me. Making one un-PC joke doesn't make someone a demon or a bigot, but not being a bigot also doesn't mean someone won't say things that are a bit iffy sometimes."
BroadCity,30m5c8,Long_Bone,7,Sat Mar 28 20:58:15 2015 UTC,"With regards to the episode being discussed, there was no need to make it about trans people at all. It wasn't essential to the plot whatsoever. Just because they couldn't think of a positive way to write trans people into that episode doesn't mean their only option was to be shitty."

So we were walking around Chinatown and I mentioned buying a handbag because that's what my sister did when she came to NYC and this Asian lady out of nowhere overheard us and just started following us like ""Handbag? You want handbag? Come with me"" so of course in our youthful ignorance we did. And she led us into this already sketchy shop, opens the wall which was secretly a door and leads us down this dark staircase to this dingy basement room, much like the one in the show (except there's no old dude eating noodles in the corner). But the room is just FULL of bags and also TONS of people were in there and it was loud and crazy. So I picked out a ""Dooney & Bourke"" one and bartered for it then went along my merry way."

Abbi looks through the peephole, unlocks several bolts, and opens the door, plunger in hand (as a weapon)  Abbi: Ilana, what the [bleep] are you doing here? You didn't answer any of my texts, I thought you went to that bunker in Long Island with your family!  Ilana: What?  Abbi: The purge???  Ilana: Wait, the purge is today?  Abbi: Yeah, dude, how do you not know about this?  Ilana: Doy! That explains all those bodies on the street! I thought they were just, like, chillin.   Abbi: Did...did you walk here?  Ilana: Yeah, this purge thing, it's, like, not that big of a deal.  Abbi: Oh my god. Get inside.  Ilana enters and Abbi shuts the door. She locks it three times and places a cheap folding chair in front of the handle.  The inside of the apartment is a bunker. Abbi has several cases of bottled water sitting next to an assortment of snacks (gotta have some Luna bars!)  Ilana: Dude, this is dope! Speaking of which she reaches into her pants, struggles a bit, and comes out holding a bag want some?  Abbi: No, I need to stay focused. Gotta keep my mind sharp.   Ilana: Wait. Is Bevers home?   Abbi: I don't know, I think he figured I'd kill him for real if he stayed here.  On mobile but lmk if you want more speculation"
BroadCity,30g921,OtotheHtotheItotheO,2,Fri Mar 27 03:18:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, this NEEDS to be an actual episode. Please post more!"
BroadCity,30g921,Twerkle-Belle,7,Fri Mar 27 10:02:59 2015 UTC,"There is a loud knock at the window. Abbi and Ilana freeze and look at each other. Abbi quietly grabs a chair and Ilana arms herself with a butter knife.  Abbi: Who is it?  Ilana: And don't lie because there's a ton of us in here and we all have guns!  Abbi: Yeah, and we're not afraid to use em!  Jaime (voice only): Oh Abbi, I am so sorry, they chase me here, I don't know what to do so I think, oh, maybe my friend Abbi if she is not dead yet will help me, but the door is locked so I climb up here--  Abbi opens the curtains. Jaime is clinging to the windowsill for dear life, his once-impeccable blazer covered in blood. He waves. Abbi opens the window.  Jaime:- Oh, thank you. Thank you thank you thank you Abbi, you are an angel of my life. And Ilana, thank you as well.  Ilana: What happened to you, dude?  Jaime: Well, I was all ready for the purge, I was in our apartment with snacks-you know, the Snickers bars, the cheese puffs, and I wake up and you are not there. So I think, if I were Ilana, where would I go? So I go to TJ Maxx but you are not there. But at TJ Maxx there are a lot of clothes, so I take some, you know, because it's the purge.  So then I think, if I were Ilana, where would I go if I did not go to TJ Maxx? And then I think, of course, Abbi, because you probably cannot survive without help. Abbi looks indignant. So I come here, but a group of investment bankers say ""hey, why don't we...why don't we kill him?"" and so I start to climb and throw the bags at them and then I knock on your window and now I am talking to you.  He points out the window to a bunch of garbage bags filled with clothing. A few men in suits stare at him angrily.  Abbi: Wait, so...why is there blood all over your suit?  Jaime: Oh, this? This is from a purge-themed rave I went to last night."

BroadCity,30g921,graduallemon,2,Sun Mar 29 01:19:28 2015 UTC,Just posted another one with Jaime!
BroadCity,30g921,naanplussed,4,Sun Mar 29 01:33:23 2015 UTC,"Ilana-Steals a few pounds of weed from her dealer/some booze/other various illicit substances and spends the rest of the Purge getting high as fuck watching old Wiggles clips. Goes over to see Abbi because obviously.  Abbi- Stays in apartment, petrified, only stepping out to grab the newspaper (for the BB&B coupons), OR, fucking raids BB&B for every damn Sodastream and electric can opener in sight. Jaime- Goes MIA. Last seen on Miami coast. Returns in 2 weeks smelling of pure ecstasy. Apologizes profusely.  Lincoln- Steals 12 dogs. Names them all Jarrod.  Bevers- Hides in room for 1 week, supplied with peanut butter, empty pop bottles, and porn. Always porn. Trey- Goes HAM on an exercise equipment store. Many casualties. 4 cold blooded murders in the protein powder isle. Jeremy- I don't know, goes to fucking Bulgaria to help orphans or some shit. Fucking Jeremy. Hopefully, gets hit by a brick because he was mean to Abbi and I don't like him.  And finally, Tree Man.  Goes on a vicious killing spree, murdering everyone in his path. But mainly Vietnamese. Because he's a tiny bit racist."
BroadCity,30g921,teaminus,0,Fri Mar 27 03:08:06 2015 UTC,"Jeremy is seen with his exquisite, obscure Swedish and Japanese guns and some sort of pretentious short sword instead of a knife. He says he is going to the Bronx to defend the kids. But he's actually going to rent-controlled apartments with senile residents who will still open the door, for identity theft and selling the keys later. Bastard.  Bevers goes on a Punisher-like quest to off guys like Durst. jk  Abbi considers going to Ripa's and trusting the jacked, smooth guards there but Kelly may want to kill again this year and snort her soul.  So Abbi and Ilana end up going to the creepy island and see Garol. She is running a to catch a predator style trap, then consuming the souls of the would-be rapists. But their dorm room escapades were minor, they just run out of there and can kind of wait near the shore and time runs out. Ilana can't see the mayhem and has #fomo."

He brought all of this on himself and tried his darndest to get sympathy and attacked anyone, including myself, who reminded him of common decency and that there's a time and place for shirts like that.   His freedom of speech defense was lame. He was right and everyone else, from the flight crew to the news reporter to the redditors to the buzzfeed commenters were wrong. He was just too headstrong to understand that he was in the wrong. Since he's deleted his profile, maybe he finally realized he was the wrong one?"

The First Amendment says that the government will make no law impeding a person's freedom of speech. As a private entity, the airline is well within their rights to refuse service to anyone who doesn't advise by their rules. If you're invited to someone's house, they're well within their rights to kick you out if they find your clothes offensive. How is this any different?   The guy was an idiot. There are few things that bother me more than when people don't fully understand the First Amendment; and then they try to apply it where it cannot be applied, because they think it's a universal rule without context."

BroadCity,2zpoej,wizardeyeswizardlies,8,Fri Mar 20 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the show is hilarious and funny all the way through. So I think if you didn't care for the first half of season 1, you probably won't like the rest of the show either."

BroadCity,2zpoej,petegex,-2,Fri Mar 20 16:47:03 2015 UTC,I was just wondering if its the sort of show that you have to stick with and it gets better.   For example the first season of Parks & Rec is nothing special - it doesn't get really good until season 2.
BroadCity,2zpoej,Jack_Kelly_imalawyer,4,Fri Mar 20 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"Workaholics sometimes doesn't work very hard for its laughs they are cheap and really lame humor especially these last two years.  Broad City is a different kind of take on people in there 20s. The girls have friends they hangout with occasionally, they don't seem to be ""losers"" like Adam, Blake, and Ders who work as Telemarketing people. Yeah Abbi and Illana have bottom of the ladder jobs but they don't seem to live in squalor like the Workaholics dudes.  It's really two different styles of comedy, both have elements of gross out humor, tons of sexual references, and more than occasional drug use. But some how Broad City comes off as a bit more sophisticated, and I have been watching Workaholics from the start and only started watching Broad City since mid season last year after my sister recommended it who lives out of state.   My sister and I share a similar comedic taste & if you're  wondering  I'm Male in late 20's and she's Female in early 20's. Just if anyone was curious sometimes when I read things on here and people say someone turned them onto a show, movie, or band etc I'm curious to if they are close in age etc."
BroadCity,2zpoej,topperharley88,3,Fri Mar 20 17:05:22 2015 UTC,"So you like gross dude shows (Workaholics) but not gross girls shows? Not saying its a sexism but honestly the styles arent all that different, just set in NY"
BroadCity,2zpoej,topperharley88,-3,Fri Mar 20 16:40:11 2015 UTC,I'm not saying there's anything wrong with girls being gross but there doesn't seem to be much behind Broad City other than that. Despite being very juvenile Workaholics can sometimes be very clever such as in their pastiches and homages - like when they go down to the sewers and assign each other as the TMNT characters.   Bottom line - Workaholics is funny - Broad City isn't.
BroadCity,2zpoej,baconfriedpork,3,Fri Mar 20 16:49:10 2015 UTC,Guess I disagree. Then again you havent seent he opening city when abbi gets her first paycheck from selling her art. That shit was a work of art
BroadCity,2zpoej,strivingforever,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:02:36 2015 UTC,"Bottom line - Workaholics is funny - Broad City isn't.   man, it's the opposite for me. workaholics doesn't do anything for me, but broad city is one of my favorite shows on tv right now. but different strokes for different folks and all that..."

BroadCity,2zlzir,envyxd,29,Thu Mar 19 18:19:12 2015 UTC,"The last season's finale was very similar.  Fewer gags, softer tone, longer unbroken conversations.  Fewer punchy sound effects.  Also more cinematically shot, with fewer cuts and longer takes.  More dramedy than comedy.  Also I think both were about birthdays.  I assume these episodes are deliberately different, and next year's finale will be the same.    At the very least the showrunners are flexing their range."
BroadCity,2zlzir,lwoodjr,17,Thu Mar 19 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"I think it was a decent finale at the tail end of a phenomenal season.  Sometimes you just get a DUD, /u/envyxd/"

BroadCity,2zlzir,hdfb,16,Thu Mar 19 22:10:07 2015 UTC,"I think this was a dialogue-heavy episode unlike the situation-heavy episodes before it.  A & I were also more observers of the insanity around them, than instigators/participants as they normally are."
BroadCity,2zlzir,goldiespapa,5,Thu Mar 19 21:20:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the situation around them was so boring. That guy that stole the bag wasn't funny. His mom was a little funnier.   At one point I thought this would be like one of those reminiscing episodes, but that was towards the end when they were discussing their last year.

I think this episode totally embodies the essence of the show. after a season with some phenomenal cameos and focus on fleshing out secondary characters, the finale went back to focus on the joy and friendship of Abbi and Ilana, which is really its grounding/driving force. I thought the anticlimactic end was perfect. I'm sad its over for the year but I couldn't be more satisfied!"
BroadCity,2zlzir,almond22,29,Fri Mar 20 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"Same, absolutely loved it. Their conversations are hilarious.

BroadCity,2zlzir,TomatoJetpack,6,Fri Mar 20 00:41:49 2015 UTC,"exactly. and there really wasn't a true B story going on either, the entire focus was on the dialogue and friendship between Abbi and Ilana and how they will continue to be Abbi and Ilana for years to come"

And it had an AP cameo which was wonderful. This episode just kind of settles back into the focus of the show which is their friendship--and not every night out is going to end up with a Val appearance. Overall I still liked it but I think because some of this seasons episodes were so phenomenal, I can see how this one seems a bit disappointing."
BroadCity,2zlzir,Figgywithit,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:41:30 2015 UTC,"I think it came down to their end chat, about their accomplishments and their hopes for a new year, and how far they've come and it's kept light (""read a book, not write one"") to express the offbeat jazz of the entire series, fortunately. It wouldn't be the same if one of them had said ""I'm going to try to give more homeless people cash"" (though it'd've been great considering the episode's plot). Really, I think all out in this case is a grand summary of love and experience like last season's, even if not as gaudy as expected (Lil Wayne, excessive wealth in the face of their barely-capable-to-pay-rent stink, NYC pizza, and a ludicrous search for something fulfilling all present and accounted for). Abbidab and Mami Lani aren't going anywhere, and I think it's fitting for the last episode to feature the other half's birthday. Both birthdays are more epic than any of mine have ever been!

I think it must have been a little wink to those in the know about something having to do with the NYC experience, but as someone who only visits there once in a while I'm not really in on the joke.  Something to do with the irony of the conformity within clans of supposed nonconformists I guess.  I regret deleting that episode from my DVR, I bet there were other inside jokes like that if you looked closely.  That added a new dimension to the show for me.  I've mostly just enjoyed the show for the characters and the funny situations, but maybe there's another more subtle layer that I've been missing entirely?"

Abbi: We met in an indie improv team called Secret Promise Circle. Ilana: Yeah, that was through Tim. This guy I was dating invited me and Abbi— Abbi: No, I was on it already. Ilana: He invited me to do this team. We were the only girls on it. Abbi: Eliot [Ilana’s brother] was on it, too. And I thought Ilana was maybe from Arrested Development for a couple weeks.  Ilana: Alia Shawkat? Abbi: So I thought that Alia Shawkat was on my improv team. I thought her name was Ilana, though. I really thought that you were her, and I was like, Oh my god. Ilana: She thought she had an opportunity. Abbi: And I was like, It’s weird that this girl that’s on Arrested Development is really bad at improv.  Ilana: Straight up. And then, the team went out for drinks, and we realized a couple people I grew up with were Abbi’s best friends from college.  Abbi: And I was like, I can’t believe my friends went to school with this girl from Arrested Development."

BroadCity,2ydvcv,SlickRick_theRuler,48,Sun Mar 8 23:30:03 2015 UTC,This kid is so adorable. It's refreshing to see a child character in a comedy show who isn't a brat.
BroadCity,2ydvcv,therealabefrohman,32,Sun Mar 8 23:53:09 2015 UTC,not only is he not a brat he's also a mother fucking hustla!

BroadCity,2ydvcv,WappyTrees,11,Mon Mar 9 16:45:36 2015 UTC,"Ilana often calls abby and other peeps 'Queen'. In the Val episode when they are recovering from their hangovers she says 'goodmorning queen' she also answers the phone with a 'whadup queen?'. She  says 'Yas queen' pretty often throughout the whole series, it's like her way of saying; get it girl, right on, fuck yeah."

BroadCity,2y8t60,Mr_Nobody_,25,Sat Mar 7 15:12:19 2015 UTC,"Abbi apparently knows Melody, so I don't think she's fake."
BroadCity,2y8t60,Whatsername_,5,Sat Mar 7 17:02:20 2015 UTC,Yeah  I feel like she rented to/with her and then Bevers just came by and never left the couch.
BroadCity,2y8t60,holyfruits,19,Sun Mar 8 07:33:33 2015 UTC,"No because on ""Citizen Ship"" you can actually hear Melody(!) in the crowd before Bevers says his announcement is about Abbi transitioning to become a guy."
BroadCity,2y8t60,Boppyd,-1,Sat Mar 7 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"The thing for me about taking this point as like ""fact"" is that it is also a bunch of wasted lawyers who've been drinking and doing who knows what else, it's very possible it's someone who was shouting to join in with the original welcome of Bevers, only because they are inebriated it came seconds late. We can't know definitively if it was actually Melody or just someone who's sense of time is off. Stuff like that has happened pretty much anytime I've been at an event with an open bar.   Either way, I'm sure we will find out more about it and I know they will do their best to make it funny and fresh."
BroadCity,2y8t60,synthetic_sound,2,Sat Mar 7 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"It seems way to elaborate of a prank for Bevers, though - he bought a ring, trapped the girls in a room, made up a story about proposing to her, acted completely scared up at the front...I don't know. I'm pretty sure we can be assured that was Melody."
BroadCity,2y8t60,Boppyd,-1,Sun Mar 8 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I just feel like the invisible cast member is overdone in comedy so I'm hoping for more twist, in whatever form it may come."
BroadCity,2y8t60,envyxd,25,Tue Mar 10 13:52:08 2015 UTC,"It's a comedy show where things are exaggerated.  It's just a running gag, like Ilana and Lincoln's undefined relationship or how Abbi never gets to be a trainer (until recently).  It'll eventually be addressed, just like some of the other running gags have been, and I bet her reason for not living with Bevers is going to be a knee slapper."
BroadCity,2y8t60,robromero1203,9,Sat Mar 7 16:03:31 2015 UTC,I think that is one of the appeals of the show.  You have this horrible guy living with you and you only see him not his girlfriend who is the actual roommate.  It's hyperbole to me in the world of roommates and there bf/gf being there more than the actual roommate.  what ever direction they take will be funny but the concept is really what is so funny.
BroadCity,2y8t60,syzygyly,3,Sat Mar 7 18:20:28 2015 UTC,You can't rent an NYC apartment with an imaginary lease co-signer so I'm pretty sure she's real and it's just a running joke
BroadCity,2y8t60,Jimmy_Corrigan,2,Sun Mar 8 13:54:33 2015 UTC,"I think we'll never actually see Melody, kinda like we never know which Springfield is the setting of the Simpsons.  It's a funny internal joke that runs throughout the series, which I hope they keep up.  It would be great to see how many different ways they could obscure her face as the show continues."
BroadCity,2y8t60,jul14nn,1 point,Sun Mar 8 00:58:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah Abbi know's Melody, they've spoken before. In the citizen ship episode she talks about speaking with Melody to get on the boat. Beaver's couldn't have done that"

BroadCity,2y8t60,teaminus,-1,Wed Mar 11 23:31:16 2015 UTC,I know it's messy and silly but my theory is that Abbi is Melody! Val inspired the idea.  Edit: You're all garbage people... living on garbage island!

I'm glad I found out about it late though since I was able to binge watch the first season and now I'm getting a new episode every week. For 10 30-minute episodes, it kinda sucks that it took almost a full year in between seasons.   I'm afraid of it becoming stale and I don't want it to become unbelievably random and predictable. Season 2 has been great though. Wisdom Teeth and the Pegging episode have been my favorites!"
BroadCity,2y2hqk,anaffairofcharacter,1 point,Sat Mar 7 09:47:37 2015 UTC,"The show suits NYC well.  I used to go down there about 30 years ago when I was in college and every single it would be filled with strange food, strange encounters and coincidences, and random hook ups with strange chicks at Columbia and NYU.  I'm not worried about the show getting stale...look at Seinfeld....a show about nothing that kept getting better..."
BroadCity,2y2hqk,envyxd,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:48:44 2015 UTC,Eh I think it is following the Workaholics season format...I personally would prefer 10 really tight episodes than 20 hit or miss
BroadCity,2y2hqk,CluelessCat,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:38:13 2015 UTC,"You're looking at this in a very black/white manner as if more episodes would mean a loss in quality while arguing that these episodes have been so good as they are because there are only a few episodes.. That's a terrible way to look at it! Also some of the episodes in season 1/2 have been very ""okay""   I think Broad City is more of a hit than a miss show, but it does miss sometimes and it's definitely not perfect!  I think it would be great if it had more episodes per season... or just at least a shorter wait in between seasons.. Wouldn't it be awesome to see it again like in September if not sooner? Waiting till 2016 to see another season is why a lot of people don't know about this show! It could benefit from more exposure.. The writers even say that they write things months in advanced before filming it so when they finally get to it they think twice about it, and in my opinion they lose some of the inspiration/motivation they had for the scenes they orgiinally wrote."
BroadCity,2y2hqk,sparklyshizzle,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"Well, for most shows with limited budget and only a few writers, yes, that is how it would work. You can have 20 episodes, but you probably will also have to include average or below average jokes. With 10 episodes, you cut out any of the fat."

Somewhat narcissistic, but I can see how people could find it pleasurable.   I don't think it was intentional, it was just showcasing how hypersexual Ilana can be.  Edit: She also does this in the first episode of the season when she's in the fitting room."
BroadCity,2y426b,envyxd,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:11:19 2015 UTC,I didn't really get the whole masturbation scene. Have you ever done it in a mirror? And what was with the lipstick?

People do it a lot and if you google it, you'll probably see both guys and gals doing it.  The lipstick was just her getting in the mood. She wanted to feel sexy while she masturbated. Think of it as lingerie, or people that crossdress and masturbate haha.  Edit: She also does this in the first episode of the season when she's in the fitting room."

In Adam's case he watches porn via the mirror so he can imagine himself being in the same room as the people in the porn.

I personally don't think acting is his thing.. his character and face just don't make it believable for me. It's like he knows the cameras are watching him.  This season has been great though. Wisdom Teeth was my favorite out of all the episodes so far."

BroadCity,2xp4va,NotThe1UWereExpectin,6,Mon Mar 2 21:53:32 2015 UTC,She's gorgeous but might be too old for the role.
BroadCity,2xp4va,birdablaze,37,Tue Mar 3 13:36:54 2015 UTC,They would do something like Kate Upton

BroadCity,2xp4va,Prinsessa,18,Mon Mar 2 22:15:45 2015 UTC,They already did that with his sister in the hurricane episode last season

BroadCity,2xp4va,janetplanet,5,Tue Mar 3 02:35:55 2015 UTC,"If they cast somebody hot to play her, she needs to be either all out, bat shit, insane, or unbelievably stupid and naive. She has to be seriously flawed to be with Beavers, i think."

BroadCity,2xpzp0,TeamLongbottom,2,Sun Mar 15 20:40:25 2015 UTC,That was awesome! I could picture all of this perfectly in my head. Bring on part 2!!!!
BroadCity,2xpzp0,magnoliak,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:12:48 2015 UTC,"It's okay, but not BC style-specific enough. It's a little trippy in the overlap of Bevers and Abbi couch scenes, but wholeheartedly I disagree on how the episode would end. I'm not sure if you meant it for a scene for Ilana to feel pain, but it feels more like fanfic than an episode. BC will always end on an offbeat note. But, I feel like that's also way far out of Lincoln's character, too—everyone knows he really only feels it for Ilana. It's fine writing about them, but not for them. I think there should be a montage of Abbi being free in her apartment, one where maybe she gets Jaime, in nurse uniform, to escort Ilana over to her place so they can sit in the bathroom together, light candles, and play Yiruma while Ilana...is sick. I'd get high and rewatch a couple episodes for inspiration and come back at it with more likely BC style. (But I mean this in all the kindest ways, because I completely support endeavors to elaborate, advertise, and imagine future and past sequences for the show... Yas, queen!)"

BroadCity,2xhmuz,Jimmy_Corrigan,4,Sun Mar 8 01:02:03 2015 UTC,"I have been the girl who buys the thing with plans of returning it and then forgets/can't/whatever so I use the expensive thing. I also had a few friends in college/post college life who've had like their ONE nice outfit/dress of that ONE nice pair of shoes. Big purchases in your early 20's. I'm 29 now and I can still count on at least one friend to be in the really nice dress she bought for college graduation at every wedding/event we go to. I'm not sure if this is exclusively an early 20'sin Nyc/expensive cities thing, but it is certainly a real thing for me."

BroadCity,2xej7g,pukecity,21,Sat Feb 28 01:00:07 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily like they set out to make a feminist show, either. It's just a show based of of their experiences, which makes it really genuine and avoids a lot of the tired old tropes that shows often rely on. TV imitating life instead of TV imitating TV.   It's so refreshing. The ""progressiveness"" is just a side effect of being anchored in reality."
BroadCity,2xej7g,Catatafish,20,Sat Feb 28 12:19:16 2015 UTC,"I love how they also subtly poke fun of themselves too. Like when Ilana and her mother scream, ""Patriarchal motherfucker!"" at some douchebag on the street. It's true and self-effacing at the same time."

Abbi is Melody.   I know, it's crazy right? But then Val happened. What if Melody is another alternate Abbi personality? Maybe she comes out when Abba-Dabs does a specific drug or being with Bevers causes PTSD or maybe...  Melody is Abbi.  Woah."

Is it possible Bevers doesn't know that Melody is Abbi? These are questions.   Edit: Ok, looking at the photos that is definitely not Abbi but I'm not giving up on it just yet.   One idea in my head is a 50 First Dates-ish situation where Abbi has an illness and doesn't know she is Bevers' girlfriend but once a year she remembers and they have a night together where he is actually romantic and self aware. Then she turns back to Abbi and we learn Melody was conjured so Bevers can stay close to his love, forced to act like an idiot (IDK why.)   But I like the idea of Melody being another alternate personality of Abbi's and Bevers and Abbi not knowing they are actually dating each other.   I know, I know, it's a messy theory. Just wanted to play with it for a bit."

BroadCity,2x6wea,mossygrowth,4,Fri Feb 27 21:21:32 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks for that. Yeah I think your perspective seems to be the dominant one, which surprises me.  Personally I disagree, and I was disappointed in the episode. I've been watching Friends for the first time ever, and its made me hyper-aware of cultural comedy that reflects uncomfortably on society. In early 90s Friends there was a lot of homophobic language and situational humour that hasn't aged well, and I wonder if this will be a similar case."
BroadCity,2x6wea,apostrotastrophe,3,Fri Feb 27 22:37:19 2015 UTC,"I rewatched Gilmore Girls this year, and there's a derogatory gay joke in every single episode."
BroadCity,2x6wea,coralto,13,Sun Mar 1 02:51:39 2015 UTC,"Well, let's think about what the joke was actually saying. ""Illana thinks white professionals think MtF people who have penises are hot"".   It's a joke on Illana, and on yuppies a bit. We know she's all about the sexy sex and while this statement she makes talks about transgendered people in an objectifying way, she objectifies everyone male, female, or any combination thereof. Her obsession with sex while avoiding emotional involvement is a large part of her character and is used for laughs pretty much constantly. Nothing negative is being said about transgenderism here. If anything it plays off of how wrong stereotypes always are.   Most shows stick to objectifying cis-women and totally ignore the existence of anyone else. I could argue that this episode was actually inclusive of transgendered people, in that they were treated exactly the way every other gender on the show is treated, LGBT or C. On top of that, when Abby was ""playing"" FtM she was applauded by a literal boatload of people. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that on TV, it's probably some kind of special moment that we should write down or something.   In conclusion, Broad City is the best. I also upvoted you in a vain attempt to counter the downvotes because I think you had a super valid question."

I still disagree here - I think perhaps for me the intent to poke fun at the stereotypes fell very flat, because I ended up feeling uncomfortable, which I don't usually when I watch Broad City. For me, I still absolutely love Broad City, but I thought that was a weird and uncomfortable episode. I'm still looking forward to an amazing one next week :-)"
BroadCity,2x6wea,aldipet,3,Sat Feb 28 19:18:45 2015 UTC,Actually thought it for a little bit too... But I feel like they are not transphobic nor did they mean to offend in anyway with that joke.

BroadCity,2x8qg3,themidnightlab,7,Fri Feb 27 05:41:47 2015 UTC,"My take on this is that Melody had to have existed at one point, since Abbi has met her before. However, she probably moved out and told Bevers but not Abbi (relying on Bevers to tell Abbi). Instead of telling Abbi, Bevers realized he can take advantage of this situation and leech off of the apartment. Guessing he's somehow paying Melody's half of the rent though -- that's the main hole I'm trying to figure out."
BroadCity,2x8qg3,rockamole,3,Thu Feb 26 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"They've mentioned that she travels for work, so she must be paying for the place but letting Bevers stay there. I doubt Bevers has his own apartment."

Abbi will bump into Melody somewhere and Melody will be talking in a ""reminiscing"" kind of way. Abbi will get confused and/or ask her why Bevers is around so much and Melody will be like ""wtf? We broke up 3 years ago"" or something similar."
BroadCity,2x8qg3,johnny996,4,Mon Mar 2 10:22:55 2015 UTC,Abbi has met her and is roommates with her  It's just a running joke like Bob Sacamano in Seinfeld
BroadCity,2x8qg3,coralto,3,Fri Feb 27 06:43:52 2015 UTC,"Well, she got them invites to a fancy boat party. Pretty awesome imaginary friend."
BroadCity,2x8qg3,bigtbonejohn,2,Sat Feb 28 12:11:27 2015 UTC,Yeah its just a running joke. It did bring it to a different level by putting the roomate in the actual scenes without breaking the pattern of her not being seen. This is alot like arrested development would do.
BroadCity,2x8qg3,Boppyd,2,Fri Feb 27 01:17:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, though my take is that Bevers is the lawyer, for whatever reason he enjoy's fucking with people, he hired someone to be Melody, like an actress or whatever. And since her boyfriend moved her in, Abbi hasn't actually seen her, just emailed/texted. Meanwhile my husband and I also think that he maybe has told the other lawyers that Abbi is his girlfriend, but obviously that's based on much less information. It may just be that Melody is the token sitcom invisible person, but I hope they twist it and do something more clever."
BroadCity,2x8qg3,ChrissiTea,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:37:11 2015 UTC,"I like this.  But if he told the Lawyers that Abbi was his gf, why would he tell them she was transitioning? Unless he plays it off as a joke or something"
BroadCity,2x8qg3,Boppyd,2,Mon Mar 2 10:24:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah the theory is full of holes. I guess I would go with: that's why they clapped for Abbi, a relative stranger. Because they were proud of Bevers for staying with her. These people are pretty yuppie and seem to be on the not politically correct side."
BroadCity,2x8qg3,thatoneone,1 point,Tue Mar 3 13:06:07 2015 UTC,They also talked about how the lawyers loved those
BroadCity,2x8qg3,optimisticeyes,0,Fri Mar 27 19:24:32 2015 UTC,"I am starting to think that Bever's is schizophrenic or something. He ""believes"" he has a girlfriend and Abbi just plays along to be kind. I could be completely wrong, though. I do think it is fuckin' hilarious, though, that Melody is never to be seen. Clever.."

BroadCity,2ws06p,tvtb,2,Sun Feb 22 21:14:59 2015 UTC,What is it about the fact that it's shot with a single camera that makes you say it's more error-prone?
BroadCity,2ws06p,remove,2,Sun Feb 22 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"My guess is if they notice this in editing, they can't do anything unless there are other camera angles they could switch to during that shot."
BroadCity,2ws06p,AnakinKardashian,2,Mon Feb 23 00:25:31 2015 UTC,"It just means there will be more takes for every scene, which introduces the opportunity for more continuity errors."

The complete opposite of Ilana, who's carefree and irresponsible but always ends up OK, Abbi gets screwed by life all the time and handles defeat in such a  hysterically funny way."

BroadCity,2vrvoy,Joegotbored,2,Fri Feb 13 20:16:02 2015 UTC,It's a subtle reference to the 5th episode that I found in the first episode!
BroadCity,2vrvoy,hemlockteabreak,0,Sat Feb 14 01:51:40 2015 UTC,If you saw the latest episode you'd get it.
BroadCity,2vrvoy,Joegotbored,-15,Fri Feb 13 20:48:20 2015 UTC,How's about you answer the question
BroadCity,2vrvoy,hemlockteabreak,2,Fri Feb 13 21:04:46 2015 UTC,"How about he Google it?  Or you Google it? Here I Googled it for you.    The image above is a direct reference to a long featured scene on the latest episode.  If you haven't seen the episode, or you watched and don't get it, go watch it (again).  Why do you want people explaining these things to you?"
BroadCity,2vrvoy,werkaccount,-6,Fri Feb 13 21:48:18 2015 UTC,Why respond to a question in the first place when you weren't willing to give the answer a person requested? Is it really that hard to not be a dick about it?
BroadCity,2vrvoy,hemlockteabreak,12,Sat Feb 14 00:19:34 2015 UTC,"It's kind of a spoiler, I imagine it would take the fun out of at least 7 minutes of the episode."
BroadCity,2vrvoy,BlackPresident,-9,Sat Feb 14 00:52:09 2015 UTC,"You could have just said that in the first place, but thank you."
BroadCity,2vrvoy,Joegotbored,3,Sat Feb 14 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"It was implied.  It's a sub to discuss a show we all like, you're gonna be asked to just watch the episodes if you haven't already before asking about a reference."
BroadCity,2vrvoy,hemlockteabreak,4,Sat Feb 14 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"I said that if he saw the latest, i.e. this week's episode, he would get it.    He phrased his question as if he had seen many episodes and couldn't place which this was from. It's a long, rememberable scene from a 22 minute episode which aired less than 2 days ago.  So I'd say original reply was both succinct and accurate and, I'm sorry that he didn't gleam this, that he didn't realize he'd missed the latest episode, and was too lazy to simply look up the reference himself and see.  So, to put it in your own phrasing, ""Why ask a question in the first place when you aren't willing to look up the answer you're requesting?  Is it really not that hard to be self reliant about it?"""

BroadCity,2vuxpz,velcrofathoms,1 point,Sat Feb 14 08:59:07 2015 UTC,"I think you got all the characters down pretty well. Abbi felt a little off in places, but I think that's just because Ilana's character comes through in the dialog better, whereas Abbi's character is more about how she says her lines. I can easily see the scene with Bevers play out. Goos use of Lincoln's vocabulary.   It seems like Abbi Ilana are basically together for the whole episode, which seems a little heavy. I feel like usually we get to see them apart for some of the episode, usually at work or with guys or something."
BroadCity,2vuxpz,DefectOrFearture,0,Wed Feb 18 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah good call. The Val episode was one of the few where it felt like they were together most of the time and it did seem to drag until we got to Val bar. I think I could split them up for awhile for sure in the middle and will give that a shot.  Appreciate the read, thank you."
BroadCity,2vuxpz,bigtbonejohn,0,Thu Feb 19 17:01:36 2015 UTC,0 comments might mean you've lost people on here. What is a spec script and do we have to download an app to understand what you want?
BroadCity,2vuxpz,bigtbonejohn,1 point,Sun Feb 15 20:54:22 2015 UTC,"It's a script written for an episode of Broad City. Writing on spec is something one does to get practice and eventually have samples to get noticed or hired. I have gotten a few notes from writers, but they weren't fans of the show. I am hoping people familiar with the show could read this if I have the tone and characters down. The link goes to an imbedded pdf so you don't need anything. It could be downloaded from the link and all you'd need is a pdf reader."

The web series  were better because it was just one premise like the subway one was just 2 mins.   Comedy Central needs a longer run time so they throw some extra shit in there.   Also I think as the girls get older, or since Amy is involved there is a lot of pop sociology involved. The type of shit posted to tumblr...kimd of kills their comedy goal. But it appeals to younger women and might get them into a degree path so I guess it serves a real world function too.  Kind of how like a lot of middle school and early high school kids listen to John Stewart and adopt his ideology to seem ""smart"" but then dismiss his drivel once they take the mandatory general electives and understand how the government functions"

Savage asked his readers to create a definition for the word ""santorum""   in response to then-U.S. Senator Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality, and comments about same sex marriage. In his comments, Santorum had stated that ""In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be.""  Savage announced the winning entry, which defined ""santorum"" as ""the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex"". He created a web site, spreadingsantorum.com (and santorum.com), to promote the definition, which became a top internet search result displacing the Senator's official website on many search engines, including Google, Yahoo! Search, and Bing.     Image i     Interesting: Rick Santorum | Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality | Savage Love   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

BroadCity,2uxblj,syzygyly,4,Fri Feb 6 05:09:56 2015 UTC,Ive noticed that even the most independent artists dont always have control of their promotional marketing.  Im sure comedy central has all the say for that. If it was up to them there would probably be more weed in the promos lol.

Anyway, I don't watch this show because it's sexual in any way. I watch it because it's genuinely funny and the characters all have great chemistry.   Some have said it's the female version of Workaholics, but I feel it's more than that, and in many ways Broad City is better. At least in my own humble opinion."
BroadCity,2uxblj,IrishPub,3,Sun Feb 8 10:15:16 2015 UTC,"I feel it is not for the ratings, but for there routine and characters. Abbi is pretty modest, where Ilana is very open, comedically so. So it would not be keeping up with what her character is without showing that side of her"

BroadCity,2usos8,trogdorkiller,1 point,Sat Feb 7 15:23:26 2015 UTC,"I mean, Coupling was a suitably more adult version of friends created in Ye Olde Country, and was fucking hilarious throughout, and wasn't afraid to take stroll through the Inferno and smell the decay, if my metaphor makes any sense. A U.S. version was doomed to be either neutered by national television or unnecessarily overdone by cable in an attempt to be relevant and missing what was funny, that is to say belivable, sustainable, character interactions that while based on care tropes were each their own narcissistic personality that wasn't set in stone. In true redditor© fashion, I obviously didn't read the wiki. But I shall defend myself, if I may. By reading that link's contents, I will know, without a doubt, that an undoubtedly insipid version of an amazing show existed for no other reason than the money, when plenty of already established shows with similar formulas existed. Whereas as if I don't click the link, it can remain in a fabricated limbo of my own creation wherein thaf is just an unnoticed joke posf written by some enterprising young comedian with a misguided yet genuine flair for satire that was just speculating a universe where another americanized Brit-Com was pitched, piloted, and had some episodes air. I am willing to believe an overly detailed lie to preserve the imagined sanctity of a show that can still be enjoyed fully in its original form. But that's just me.  TL;DR I didn't read link, and choose to believe it is a joke wiki page that hasn't been cleaned yet."
