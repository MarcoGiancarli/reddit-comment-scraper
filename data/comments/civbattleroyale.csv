Also Lincoln's UA seems a bit OP.  7) Zapotecs because Battle Priests look AWESOME!  8) Picked Ottomans but really hard choice and I'd be happy with either of the two.  9) New Zealand, because while the Maori are awesome the lack of any help in the naval dep't will likely make them irrelevant"
civbattleroyale,3e1ha2,KnightofNi,11,Tue Jul 21 10:48:06 2015 UTC,"Simply because of the Egyptian AI spamming nothing but war chariots (and thus chronically taking cities to 0 hp and never capturing them), I chose the Ayyubids.

civbattleroyale,3e1ha2,Darth_Kyofu,10,Tue Jul 21 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"As a rule, I prefer the more well known cultures, pretty much just because it makes for a more historically, politically, culturally interesting BR.  I totally understand that different Civs work better or worse given their AI, but for this one BR, I really prefer to see history's greatest - where possible.  So consequently:  India > Burma  Korea > N. Korea (although I still find Great Leader hilarious)  Egypt > Ayyubids  Don't even care on Sweden vs. Norway  Roosevelt FTW!  I do approve of this one.  New Zealand > Maori  Maya > Zapotecs  Ottomans > Byzantium  Scotland > Ireland (on this one, though, I could make an exception due to space concerns).  I think the most important one is including Egypt.  You can't have a world BR of the greatest cultures w/o them."
civbattleroyale,3e1ha2,TheSpecialize,5,Tue Jul 21 11:37:41 2015 UTC,"1) Don't really care, but I chose Egypt, mainly because if memory serves, the Ayyubid didn't do much in the Mk. 1  2) Sejong's Korea.  Like I said in an earlier topic, I'd rather have a scientific superpower than a joke Civ that will probably be nothing more than target practice for China/Mongolia/Japan  3) Burma.  From what I understand, Ghandi usually doesn't accomplish much in AI battles.  4) Undecided.  I'm interested to see a war between the two, but it might just end up being a stereotype England/Celtic type war where no one ever wins.  5) Honestly, I don't want either.  England was weak enough in the Mk. 1 without having to share their islands.  If I had to choose, I'd say Ireland, mainly because then they'd at least have their respective islands.  6) Lincoln.  I want a change from Washington, and I kind of want to see the ""civ""il war unfold.  (I'll show myself out.)  7) Zapotecs. Just on the off chance they actually manage to take advantage of the Battle Priests.  8) Doesn't matter, picked Byzantium because I've never even heard of that particular mod.  9) New Zealand. Just because it's different."
civbattleroyale,3e1ha2,TimGB,7,Tue Jul 21 17:31:51 2015 UTC,"Egypt > Ayyubids. The Arabs are already represented and while both civs usually don't do much, the Ayyubids do even less. Also historical significance. Sejong > Kim. No question here. Burma > Gandhi. India is already represented by the Mughals, and Burma is a more interesting civ, and has a better TSL. Also, too much green. And India usually doesn't do anything. Separate civs. Sweden-Norway is a diplomatic civ with a very late defensive bonus, completely not suitable for the Battle Royale. Both have their pros and cons. Scotland has a better start, but has to share it with England. Ireland has its own island, but it is much smaller. If I were you, I'd increase the size of the island in case they get in. Roosevelt. His civ feels more different due to the color and city list. Zapotecs. The Mayan AI isn't the best and the Zapotecs are a much cooler and better looking civ. Byzantium. The Turks are already in, and if he uses the vanilla Ottomans, well, they're just a bad civ. Also, Istanbul might not be on the right place.  This version of Byzantium also isn't very common on AI games. Don't really mind, though I slightly prefer New Zealand."

In all AI Matches that i've messed around with myself Ghandi does jack-all in any of them until nukes and honestly the nukes alone aren't enough of a reason for him to be there. Most of the other choices in the poll I'm very indifferent to but voted as followed. North Korea > Korea. I Personally enjoy some joke Civs. Ayyubids > Egypt. No real reason just preference I'm fine with either. Keep Sweden & Norway. I'm looking forward to some Nordic wars between Sweden, Norway & Finland. Although I wouldn't mind seeing Sri Lanka make it. Lincoln's America. I'd want to see either him or Roosevelt just for a change of pace. Maori > New Zealand. I don't see a point to replacing Maori. That's just my opinion. Byzantium > Ottomans.

civbattleroyale,3e1ha2,Treeninja1999,3,Tue Jul 21 10:57:15 2015 UTC,"Posting this in here as well:  Firstly, I think neither Ireland or Scotland should be in the BR. Europe is already very crowded, and so could easily lose a civ or two without it making much difference there, and improving things elsewhere. I personally think that every civ in the BR should have at least an outside chance of winning, and having more than one civ on the British Isles essentially guarantees neither civ will win, meaning supporting either civ is much less fun as you already know the end result. A single civ on the isles at least has a small chance of success, also making wars with surrounding civs (in the long term) more interesting and competitive. The removal of Ireland/Scotland also allows another civ to exist somewhere where it too stands an outside chance of winning, and also stops another civ getting to big and powerful to early (eg. Sri Lanka, Kilwa, Yakutia or The Philippines)  Secondly, I think the Ottomans should be in over Byzantium. The Roman Empire already exists in the game, and Byzantium is essentially the eastern half of the dissolved Roman Empire, meaning Rome is sort of represented twice, but Turkey and Turks not really at all. The Ottomans provide more variety, and also deserve to be in as they were historically a very large and successful empire, more so than Byzantium. While this is not as much of a logistical issue, as it is simply choosing one out of two civs, I feel The Ottomans give the BR more historical and cultural variety, and make sure Turks are represented in the BR.  Finally, I agree that Burma should be in over India, and the Ayyubids in over Egypt, for reasons explained elsewhere in this thread."

civbattleroyale,3e1hri,Pizzarcatto,5,Wed Jul 22 00:03:40 2015 UTC,"Egypt > Ayyubids. The Ayyubids had their chance in the last one and we saw how little they did. Their awesome resistance against Ethiopia notwithstanding (wow, I almost never use that word), I want to see what Egypt can do.  North Korea > Korea. Not so much for gameplay reasons, but for exactly the same reason I'd rather have Nazi Germany than Imperial Germany. Big names make it fun.  Burma > India. I was going to choose Gandhi, but other people's arguments have swayed me.  Sweden-Norway > Sweden & Norway. Simply because it makes room for Sri Lanka. Europe's crowded enough already, and more civs in the mountains won't help.  Scotland > Ireland. I'm convinced by the argument people have put forward about Ireland just being a one-island civ. At least with Scotland we get wars.  Lincoln > the others. If we're having the Confederates, you have to have Lincoln. ;)  Mayans > Zapotecs. I'll be honest, I don't know enough about the Zapotecs. If they're actually more suitable than the Mayans I'm trusting I'll be outvoted.  Ottomans > Byzantium. I was undecided... until someone pointed out we already have the Romans.  Maori > New Zealand. In my opinion, Civ is about peoples, not already-established nations."

Then we have the uu which are the defender and the Anzac. I think these units are better than the maoris.

Don't they not even consider themselves ""North Korea,"" but actually the real Korea, while the South is kind of like separatist rebels in their eyes? It's like using Feodor I for Russia instead of Catherine, Peter, or even Stalin."
civbattleroyale,3dx4e1,Sprinklesss,3,Mon Jul 20 17:06:22 2015 UTC,"For the record, while I don't know exactly how naming conventions work in Korean, I think that Kim is Kim Jong Un's family name, because his father was called Kim Jong Il and his father was called Kim Il Sung.   That said, I see your point. It's far from the best leader to have for Korea."

I don't argue he was a great leader, but he was significant as fuck in terms of Russian history.  My point was that Feodor was a simpleton and had to have a regent during his rule because he was unable to comprehend many matters of the state. His only child died sickly as a 2 year old, so Feodor's death signaled the end of the Rurikid dynasty and the start of a very dark period in Russian history called the Time of Troubles. I compared him to Kim because if Kim were to die today, it's reasonable to assume his nation would not look on his rule very fondly and he would not be widely regarded as a significant part of Korean history as a whole."

civbattleroyale,3dtzih,ajwz,19,Sun Jul 19 13:19:00 2015 UTC,I think it would be best to have only one civ in the British Isles.
civbattleroyale,3dtzih,langlo94,2,Sun Jul 19 18:32:38 2015 UTC,I would actually argue that there should be no civ on the british isles.... no reason.
civbattleroyale,3dtzih,FetishMaker,15,Mon Jul 20 22:41:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree. These AI games have shown over and over that AI with island starts do a very poor job at sending settler to other land masses or waging successful wars against Civs on other land masses. Ireland will only have room for 1 city, instantly dooming Ireland to be the weakest Civ in the game as it fails to send settlers to other lands well.  It will be an irrelevant Civ from the start that will be defeated as soon as England or another civ declares war. England will probably settle the whole of the main British isles before Ireland can get a settler over."
civbattleroyale,3dtzih,mcinthedorm,7,Sun Jul 19 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"the same thing could be said about indonesia. I think ireland in that scenario would still be in a better situation than scotland and england, who would probably also only have 2 cities each but would also likely be stuck in a pointless destructive war with each other from early on in the game"
civbattleroyale,3dtzih,mcinthedorm,5,Sun Jul 19 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"Indonesia actually has a decent amount of land to itself to establish itself as a decent Civ. Ireland has room for 1 city. Britain/Celtics will likely already have the entire mainland settled before Ireland can get some other cities up, and even then will be at an immediate disadvantage because it's cities will be disjointed and separated by water.   I'd rather see an early war for the British isles with 1 civ emerging victorious and become a British Isles powerhouse versus... Having Britain automatically become the British Isles powerhouse while Ireland is stuck with 1 city island start.  I honestly think an Irish civ will immediately become so irrelevant with its very small island start and with the typical bad civ AI that it would be better to just make Britain or the Celts the lone Civ. An Irish civ will offer so little competition that it would be better not adding it at all."
civbattleroyale,3dtzih,misko91,5,Sun Jul 19 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"so would and england and scotland on those islands. more so than ireland I think.  I think really the britsh isles should only have one civ, but, since it seems with 60AIs they are destined to have 2, I'd much rather have Ireland over Scotland. my point is that even in the scenario you descruibed, Ireland would be still be more powerful than the england and scotland in the scenario I described"
civbattleroyale,3dtzih,mcinthedorm,2,Sun Jul 19 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"British Isles powerhouse   Aha! There's the rub. There is never a British isles powerhouse. I've seen only one AI game every where England did well, and that was the tiny AI game.  England is almost always faced with the immediate prospect of dangerous irrelevancy. Your entire premise is off in that respect. Just think about it, it has every factor that makes civs weak: small area, much competition, separated from enemies by water. Even with one civ, it still has two very strong factors against it."

All or most of the free land would already be gobbled up, unlike in the Pacific."
civbattleroyale,3dtzih,AWisZOO,5,Sun Jul 19 21:57:37 2015 UTC,I think having any more than one civ on the British Isles is just going to doom all the civs there. England and Japan had a hard enough time in the last battle royale trying to break into mainland areas when they were just by themselves. There's just not enough land to go around and by the time they are able to send settlers overseas they'll already have an uphill battle to get a foothold on the mainland.

I understand that the UK last BR wasnt doing anything and people want 2 civs to bring aggression to the isles, so I say put in the most aggressive mod. I assume people want the UK or England but if ireland or scotland is more aggressive than I say choose them. I agree the civs will become irrelevant if trapped together, but 1 inactive civ is boring. Add the most aggressive mod and you get an exciting relevant civ.  TL;DR Put only 1 (but the most aggressive) civ on the british isles."
civbattleroyale,3dtzih,ScienceGhost,7,Mon Jul 20 02:10:54 2015 UTC,"If you look at the test run, it only looks like the AI settled 5 cities on all of the British Isles, with only 1 of them being in Ireland. That barley seems like enough for one civ, let alone 2 or possibly 3. The AI also had a city in Iceland and 2 cities across the channel. I agree that that corner of the world might be a little empty without more civs, but it just doesn't seem like there is enough land for multiple civs.  We can't have England, Scotland, Ireland, and Iceland all in the same area without adding more land for them to settle."

As of now though I'm only using 4-5 gameplay altering mods, one that increases the length of the game, and another custom built mod called ""Archaeologists are VERBOTEN"", built especially for the BR that renders civs unable to build Archaeologists  The other three are More Luxuries, Bigger Empires (empires expand borders faster, cheaper and up to 8 tiles away) and Aggressive and Expansive AI (which I've edited so that civs aren't prone to build too many units).  Although I may not be a programmer, I do work with (and create) lots of mods.

What do you think about a very small, but effective mod called ""Cities 4 hexes away""? It could decrease the city spam, but then again with 60 civs they may have big problems with founding already 3rd or 4th city, so I don't know... I am also thinking that maybe it would be useful to write a small mod disabling ""embargo city states"" resolution, so that the civs won't be wasting time to enact and repeal it.  I have no hopes for any AI improvement mods to work - the current ones are either great and unfinished, or not working so well."

In general, I don't see a need to create a mod to prevent the AI from making pointless decisions--it is rather fun pointing out AI stupidities. The army of archaeologists were a bit much though and I am happy to see a mod preventing them.  In your original post, you had concerns for gameplay mods that potentially cause more trouble than improvement. In this post, you suggest adding more, custom mods. Isn't that contradictory? I'm not even sure what ""cities 4 hexes away"" would do--disable the city spacing rule??  TL;DR: yes, you should stop quick posting at work"

In the last BR Iceland sort of de facto went over to Britain, and then Greenland got gobbled up by a mix of factions. Iceland would have, of course, Iceland, and would likely inhabit the whole of Greenland as well. It may also provide some pressure on the northernmost reaches of NA, which last time were split between the US and Canada. I think it'd be an interesting dynamic to add.

Meanwhile, the most relevant thing Indonesia did was settle a one-tile island, Gran Colombia (I believe) is still in while causing a crash delaying the entire Battle Royale, and Armenia has just as much reason to be in as the Ayyubids- this time, protecting from the Soviets.  The Ayyubids at least deserve to be in this Battle Royale if so many other civilizations from the first will be able to get by in very similar situations of relevancy as the Ayyubids."

No mods that I know of actually have a TSL there, but you could probably make an argument for putting either Tahiti, Tui Tonga, or the Rapa Nui there. Indonesia always seems to be the last place settled outside of siberia (which hopefully will get a civ to contest mongolia as well), and it seems like it would make sense for a civ to be dropped there, even with two civs on the aussie mainland and the Maori down in New Zealand. It isn't like there isn't significantly more competition for less land in Europe (see Nazis vs Poland or Sweden vs Norway vs Finland), so that can't really be an issue here."
civbattleroyale,3dficv,Ifeelfine_,12,Wed Jul 15 23:35:43 2015 UTC,We could always slot in the Philippines for island expansion. There's also the Papuans.

civbattleroyale,3dficv,LacsiraxAriscal,2,Thu Jul 16 04:31:38 2015 UTC,I think that's a result of starting on a 1-tile island and not Tonga itself. Happened to me on testing a couple times

If they can survive to Gurkhas, they get a strong unit that constantly gets stronger and could help them come from behind in the late game.  3.Sri Lanka  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=400353266&searchtext=  Fresh water faith hunters threaten to spread up the Indus valley! Basically just a civilization to a) fill south India and b) have a faith focus, as not many of the civs seem to have that.  4.Tahiti  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=226898603  Lost in the currents. Tahitian settlers can instantly embark on Ocean tiles, but until they discover Astronomy any settler gets ""blown away"" to any random coastal tile.

Nepal would be good to have as well, as they'd have a really defensible position up in the Himalayas, but I believe that they'd have to replace Tibet. Sri Lanka would be nice, but I fear they may get stuck down south quite early becoming another turtle...

civbattleroyale,3dficv,KingEggbert,6,Thu Jul 16 01:37:25 2015 UTC,Replacing the Boers is an interesting option if you want to make Southern Africa more competitive - would mean the whole thing wasn't conquered right off the bat

I also hope we're doing ottomans or Byzantium instead of hittites so there is a bit more room to expand in the middle east and that they can be a part of European stuff as well.  I'd say the Ashanti would be a great civ to add. I think Africa has the most room and a total of Morocco, Carthage, Egyptian civ, Ethiopia, Mali/Songhai, Ashanti, Kilwa, Kongo, Boers, and Zulu could be pretty great. There are other good choices for that area though with Benin and the Nri Empire as well  Another good civ would be a cascadia region civ. I don't know if there are any good Haida/Tlingit mods but a civ for them could be good.  The Philippines could be cool as well as more competition in the region is nice. However their main mod isn't all that militaristic so perhaps a different civ in the area could work.  Finland would be nice but then poland would really have nowhere to expand and poland as fan favorites are pretty much guaranteed"

With help from Firaxis (I think) and a reduction in the number of mods he's improved stability, and the new plan is to marathon the playthrough instead of doing load after load to keep our risk factor low. Those things should help. Yesterday's play was certainly encouraging, getting to the WWII tech-level portion of the game without experiencing turbulence should be a very, very good sign."
