He's just speaking on behalf of the GOP's voting record. That's not mudslinging. That's just the truth.   Besides, Bernie is traditionally independent, but signed on with the Democratic Party because that's the vehicle most likely to get him elected."

You might want to consider traveling here to sign the credits just so you can sign up for the classes you need and not get left behind. You might want to ask in the welcome center if there is any form to waive a signature, which I am sure there has to be, and you can receive the credit and sign up. Or rather, talk to your college adviser and have them approve your class, by letting them know that you will sign off your AP credit. You can google a list of advisers and their emails. You can do it! Let us know if you need any help!"

In my experience, juniors/seniors will be able to provide you with the better advice than the actual advisors.   I would not take any comsci classes though. They usually require a lot of work. If you can (I am not sure though), take some Subsea (MECE 6xxx) classes. They will look good on your resume.   Check if there is a FB page for mechanical engineering society at UH. IEEE has one. I think the one for mechanical is called ASME or smth like that and I think they are located on the second floor next to the labs and etc (i also think they share their room with Civil guys but I might be wrong)."

UniversityOfHouston,3dnfdc,nishcheta,0,Sat Jul 18 04:33:09 2015 UTC,"No, but seriously.  Great example:   Republican fiscal policy during the recession was to cut the deficit by ending unemployment benefits.  This had the obvious economic benefit of reducing the unemployment rate, as people would stop taking government handouts and get back to work.    Except when Republicans cut the social safety net, the unemployment rate was virtually unchanged.  So it turned out to be an idiotic move that put millions into greater hardship.    This is the ""better fiscal policies"" you are talking about."
UniversityOfHouston,3dnfdc,nishcheta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:09:17 2015 UTC,"You're right, that's bad policy.  Fiscal conservative means (to me) you believe in cutting spending, balancing the budget, and raising taxes only when and where necessary.

As to what spending you cut, and how you deal with revenue... that dives into all sorts of politics that quickly muddy the conversation.   Not really...both parties have a platform.  Democrats want to raise taxes on the wealthy to support social programs, with offsetting cuts in wasteful defense programs.  Republicans want to raise taxes on the poor to support tax cuts for the wealthy, and cut social programs to support even more tax cuts for the wealthy.  This isn't new, either - it goes back to Reagan.  It's not 'muddy' - that's what each is trying to accomplish."

An even better recommendation is to sit down with Ms. Sturm or the other advisor whose name I have yet to remember, and have a discussion about what is the best route for you.

If you've done everything you need to do to graduate and applied for graduation, all you need to do now is wait. I am a bit surprised that you just now applied for graduation. You should've applied to graduate a while ago. I applied for my May graduation back in November when my adviser told me I should. From what I understand, you normally apply to graduate the semester before you finish up or early in your last semester, not immediately after you finish.  To check on your degree status, check your MyUH account. Click on ""Apply for Graduation"" and click ""Graduation status."" It should still say ""Applied for Graduation."" If it does, just wait and you'll get an email with the subject line ""Degree Conferral Email"" telling you you've been awarded your degree.   It may take a little while for them to process (I finished my last class on May 4, and wasn't told my degrees were awarded until around June 4, well after the graduation ceremony), but once you get that, it's just a couple of weeks for them to mail your diploma out to you.

So I only needed to take math, science, and major specific classes which for me was nice.   In general if you will probably get an A in the class, take it.

I know some of my friends in Accounting that I'm making more than, but not all of them. The thing with Accounting is you'll do much better if you go 5 years and get your masters and then take the CPA test. After that, I'm quite sure you'd be making more, but you'd be forgoing that year of earnings as well. I was an Accounting major before I switched to SCM, so I sort of know where you're at decision-wise. This site pretty well covers earnings, I'm making just above average for SCM.  Nah, I could have elected not to travel, but I don't have anything (dog, family, etc.) that I need to stay in Houston for so I chose to. Definitely not required. I will say I've never missed Houston as much as I do now, and I can't wait to go home. 3 months is way longer than I thought.  I usually work 40 solid hours a week, but alot of people in my same position work less, I just want to make a good impression and I guess they don't really care. Some weeks are shorter because there's not much to do, some are longer (last week was a doozy, but I think I was only there about 50 hours total). Being on salary allows for a lot of flexibility."

There are I think 10 online tests based on some short slide show videos, and they are all incredibly easy. I got them all done in under 24 hours. No reason to not get 100% on those. That alone is something like 80% of the grade for the class. The other 20% is participation in online discussions. You have to make 3 posts per week based on an article you're given to read. Reading the article + writing decent replies shouldn't take more than half an hour.  GEOL 1340 - Earth Systems. Online class with on-campus tests. I took this back in 2011, so it may have changed since then, but when I took it, it was 6 tests you take on campus, with practice tests online. About 90-95% of the actual test is verbatim from the online test.  Also, if you want to think more long-term, I'd recommend not taking the really easy classes early on unless you think you're going to need them to keep off of academic probation. The university calculates honors based on the last 54 hours you take, so if you're able to hold the easy classes for your last few semesters, you can boost your chances at graduating with honors."

This course is known for being completed in a day. You don't even really have to watch the lectures, she provides a PDF of the slides and a transcript of what she says. VERY easy A."
UniversityOfHouston,3d1so9,moxius,8,Sun Jul 19 16:50:08 2015 UTC,Why not take something you are interested in instead of something easy? You are paying a lot of money to go to college and the experience will only be what you make of it.
UniversityOfHouston,3d1so9,Grievous958,3,Mon Jul 13 06:05:13 2015 UTC,"Class Piano 1. If you've ever done anything with music, you've got a head start. The first few weeks of the class is just learning how to read music. An absolute breeze. If you do well in the first part, the second half gets a bit more difficult but nothing you can't handle if you have a decent grasp of piano by the end of the first semester. The only bad thing is it's only 2 hours, so if you're only taking 3 hour classes it might make it uneven. If you have to stick a 1 hour lab in there it would be good for filling the hole."

I have played the piano a little and the violin for quiet a long time and am wanting to learn the piano further for my enjoyment purposes.

UniversityOfHouston,3d1so9,Grievous958,2,Mon Jul 13 02:48:07 2015 UTC,Not online at all. They have a classroom with pianos (electric so students can have headphones and not have to hear everyone playing). If you know piano basics you can take the first half for a free A and then take the second half to actually learn stuff. I even got a bit of theory.

They didn't invite us to the Big 8 or Big 12 because they were tired of getting their asses beat by us in spectacular form. Baylor also unilaterally blocked our entry. UT has been tremendously bad to us (Shasta and being total bitches about home and homes). They just see UT and see stars. I hate basically every team in the Big 12 for various reasons, except maybe OSU. The Big 12 is a struggling conference, us going there will do the exact same thing as us going to the Big East.

UniversityOfHouston,3cewqn,nagarrow,2,Tue Jul 7 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"It might depend on what department/program you're in, but at least in my department the entering graduate students don't register for classes until they show up for orientation in August. Grad classes have smaller enrollment totals and are frequently only populated by students from a single grad program, so in most registration isn't nearly as competitive as it is for undergraduate courses, and you'll be guaranteed a spot in the courses you need. But like others have said, contact the graduate advisor from your department to find out the real scoop."

""In the shadows of the 4th largest city"" was a great place to be when I graduated. I was at the top of my class, both in high school and in college and loved going to football games both in Roberson and now in TDECU. I'm a Cougar and I make 140K a year and use my UH education every day of my life. Also, I'm indifferent to A&M and UT. You get out of a university what you put into it. Where you go matters a lot less than who you are, who you know, and what you can do with what you learned."

UniversityOfHouston,3cbj38,RousseauTX,2,Wed Jul 8 02:18:45 2015 UTC,"Economics (B.S.). The science factor was a lot of statistics classes but it was worth it. I work as project oversight and controls for an industrial engineering and construction firm. I use my stat and Econ training quite regularly. I had really great professors in Econ. Professor Gregory (whom I believe is still teaching) mentored me. I was also in the Honors Program which I loved. Human Sit. Was mind opening and transformative for me. I'm quite fond of my time at UH. Of course, you have to get out of your comfort zone once and a while to really ingratiate yourself and humble yourself to meet new people and establish connections. That's what it's all about. Even today, doing great work isn't enough, it's about the people."

If you already understand the material for the first section, there is no need to do a refresher and pay over a grand for it. Cal 1 is your basic integrations and derivatives. If you can do that then you are ready for part 2. Cal 2 is when you get into having to solve more complicated combinations of integrations and derivatives. They just require a little more of a break down, equation wise. I would say go ahead and skip and save the money. If you can do it already, then you shouldn't have a problem. Just keep in mind that you can already do it, don't let it scare you because you are moving up to a college level. One thing that helped me with engineering at UH was my experience from the military when it comes to exams and training. Basically the idea is that if you prepared and can do it when you were preparing, then you will pass the exam. Exams were meant to be passed. You should be fine."

UniversityOfHouston,3bxmfm,theasianhulk,6,Fri Jul 3 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you what no one told me. As a commuter, you'll want anything but the Economy/Student pass. I recommend the Garage Pass. This may be counter intuitive, ""why does my car need to be in the garage, I'm not leaving it here overnight""... well little Cougar, unless you plan to arrive to campus at the crack of dawn (9am latest), you'll be hard pressed to find spots in the Economy lot.  Register for classes, get familiar with where your classes are located, then purchase a garage pass that's closest to your first class of the day."
UniversityOfHouston,3bxmfm,royalsego,2,Fri Jul 3 01:39:31 2015 UTC,"Yep. For the last three years, I always get to school at 7 to ensure I have a spot as close as possible to previously Moores, and now band wing."

UniversityOfHouston,3bxmfm,coaxfun,2,Fri Jul 3 00:31:37 2015 UTC,There are no specific parkings spots. Different parking passes allow you to park in different areas. Ex. A garage pass lets you park in the garage and economy areas.
UniversityOfHouston,3bxmfm,STATSKID,2,Fri Jul 3 01:05:37 2015 UTC,All of my classes start around 10. Which lot would you recommend?
UniversityOfHouston,3bxmfm,SU7sin1o3,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:37:56 2015 UTC,"Either an economy pass (you'll park near campus and take a bus in, but it's very cheap) or a garage pass (you park very close to campus, but it's the most expensive)."
UniversityOfHouston,3bxmfm,FliteSchool,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:42:31 2015 UTC,"If you have the economy pass, I'd recommend parking at the ERP at that time. A bus comes and picks you up to and from the ERP/campus around every 15 min."

UniversityOfHouston,3bxmfm,srassen7,3,Fri Jul 10 08:35:59 2015 UTC,Don't let anyone tell you that you wont be able to find parking after 9 or 10. Complete bullshit. Been commuting for three years and I get to campus after 10 all the time and find parking behind the Architecture building.

Student org are good for only two semesters before they become redundant IMHO.
UniversityOfHouston,3bnysz,CommunicationsSPO,2,Tue Jun 30 23:59:57 2015 UTC,"While some things do repeat, we try and add new things to keep it fresh each semester. What makes joining an organization beneficial are exactly those resume builders, but are specified to your degree. We offer supply chain case competitions, resume workshops, contracts workshops, negotiation workshops that are all sponsored and ran by these big companies you want to work for, so you get face time with recruiters. Most importantly though are the Career Mixers. Not all hire exclusively from these, but I know all those companies I mentioned before have hired many, and plan to hire more, directly from those mixers. Also the network you gain from a these will be beneficial for the rest of your career. It's all about what you put into it. Of course it's not absolutely necessary to join to get an internship, it just makes it so much easier."

UniversityOfHouston,3bf15z,frakking-anustart,3,Sun Jun 28 19:25:43 2015 UTC,I've said it before and will say it again. UH doesn't add a lot of market to the Big 12. The only way I see us moving is if there is about to be a mass exodus from the Big 12. It'll be exactly like the Big East all over again. I think we would be better served getting picked up by PAC or SEC. I'd prefer PAC. They don't have any market in Texas and I think we fit in well.
UniversityOfHouston,3bf15z,SometimesY,5,Sun Jun 28 23:14:45 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer PAC...I think we fit in well.   Apart from the whole being 1,000 miles from the nearest member of the conference."

Honestly we're in a really bad position for expansion because of our geography. PAC really wants in Texas though. If the Big 12 keeps OU satisfied by bringing in a couple of other schools (likely UCF and Cincy), then I could see PAC trying to pull us in. SEC doesn't gain much by adding us so even though it would be nice, it likely won't happen. Realistically, PAC or ACC are where we'd go since the ACC also wants in Texas as well.  Edit: the ""realistically..."" bit was assuming that we'd get an invite somewhere. I'd bet my right nut that it won't happen though. Pretty much everyone has a massive superiority complex when it comes to us. Pretty fucking shitty."

The Westburo baptist church can come and yell and have big signs that say ""God hates fags"" and ""thank god for dead soldiers"" and if they get kicked off campus, they will sue because they, like the preachers, and like any of us, have the right to be there. It's public property and the police will do their job and let them spout their 1st amendment. Now, I don't agree with all that gross hate, but they do have the right to say it."
UniversityOfHouston,3b9zb2,InquisitiveLion,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:02:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Look around. Universities all over the country are banning people for hate speech. Houston is one of the few schools remains that still allows it. The University isn't taking a side on anything. They'll still continue to allow these same people to talk about whatever they want, and they'll still tell security to protect them.  The statement made by UH is nothing more than a show of support for those positively affected by the legal ruling. It's not them picking a side."
UniversityOfHouston,3b9zb2,BallnOnABudget,-4,Sun Jun 28 06:10:33 2015 UTC,"So you're taking the university being sued by people they try to kick off campus as a sign they're impartial? The other schools are clearly in violation of the law and will be sued and have to pay out money.   Just down the road from UH, at a smaller college, someone was kicked out of a UC for holding a sign that said protect your gun rights. That's it. He then sued the school and won because they impeded his first amendment right.   UH clearly picked a side on this issue, and I'm sure than many donors will reconsider if their money is being put to good use on an impartial education that lets students figure out who they are supposed to be instead of having an ""approved"" way of thinking. That's what the private schools are for."
UniversityOfHouston,3b9zb2,InquisitiveLion,2,Sun Jun 28 06:27:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I disagree with most of the things you've said. Firstly, one anecdote of a single student suing has little to do with upholding the first amendment. It's like the same old argument most people use about yelling 'bomb' in a crowded theatre to illustrate that the first amendment has limits, public universities are able to defend banning hate speech on an increasing basis by claiming it's for the protection of students.  Secondly, I hope some of the donors do reconsider their money. I'm sure the same thing happened to first universities to desegregate black and white students years ago, and I look forward to know which rich assholes can take their hate elsewhere.  Lastly, if you think a singular twitter post is the university promoting an ""approved way of thinking,' then what's the point of having all the professors? All those educators who spent years upon years learning their respective fields, then spent the rest their lives empowering young minds are clearly being undermined by 160 characters or less. I, for one, won't stand for such egregious behavior."
UniversityOfHouston,3b9zb2,BallnOnABudget,6,Sun Jun 28 06:41:38 2015 UTC,...Because they're celebrating diversity and inclusiveness.
UniversityOfHouston,3b9zb2,foamyfrog,-8,Sat Jun 27 22:19:06 2015 UTC,How are they celebrating total inclusiveness when they're clearly taking a side on a highly divisive topic?
UniversityOfHouston,3b9zb2,InquisitiveLion,10,Sat Jun 27 23:02:04 2015 UTC,The only divisive thing about is the people that want to deny someone else's rights because they don't agree with their lifestyle even though it has no effect on their lives at all.

Housing for Moody Towers, Cougar Village I, Cougar Village II, Cougar Place, and the Quadrangles to not offer Winter or Summer housing at all, and in most cases you will be responsible for locating a place to stay in another building. Bayou Oaks (greek life) and Calhoun Lofts (upperclassmen) have a year round contract, but occupancy is high. I would keep an eye out on the housing website for availability.  I can't answer #2.  3.) Yes, as long as they have your information, they can set you up to pay.  4.) I am geting my BAS of Hotel and Restaurant Management, and not a Graduate student, but I can say that depending on your major, it'll be busy. A lot of the Grad students prefer to live a non-disturbed life, don't attend many housing events despite the opportunity. I would recommend finding a club, joining an organization, and meeting your neighbors (drinks, food, relaxing) the first days to avoid the Grad stigma.

UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,Jackrabbit1101,12,Fri Jun 19 05:32:27 2015 UTC,One of the best hrm colleges in the nation. Super friendly people including professors. Only had one professor I wasn't totally happy with. Lots of networking opportunities. They also offer a minor in beverage management. The college is small so you kind of get to know the people in your classes.   The whole university is nice but the surrounding area isn't so be careful near the edges of campus. We have food trucks come on weekdays (I believe they rotate daily) also some good restaurants around campus. Sports aren't as big here as other schools but we do have coog crew for people that really love u of h sports. The performance hall usually has a decent event once a month.   If you're doing the hrm program you should consider doing the program for excellence in selling to. Teaches how to sell and gives you good hands on experience selling.
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,BigBlue78,5,Fri Jun 19 07:55:15 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear you've liked it so much. I don't think anyone has told me anything bad about the program yet, so that gives me a lot of confidence I made the right choice to go here.   Selling what, is it like, marketing in general - or more of a retail oriented thing?   And yeah, my GF and I plan on living a bit outside of Houston and me commuting to school from there - we didn't really want to live in-in Houston."
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,Pathis,5,Fri Jun 19 14:02:33 2015 UTC,"Unless you have a reason to live outside the loop and commute, I would live close to campus. There are some nice places outside the 3rd Ward in EaDo and in the Medical District. Traffic can get pretty brutal in the mornings. Additionally, if you work while you are in school (which I recommend) you will want to live as close to work and school as possible because hospitality jobs have brutal hours. Also, there is a great density of restaurants, hotels, clubs, etc in inside 610 west of 45."
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,Pathis,3,Fri Jun 19 15:12:25 2015 UTC,"Well the main reason I want to live a bit out of Houston is so my SO can avoid as much traffic as she can. I know that is impossible around a large city, but she gets anxiety really badly in large areas of traffic like here around Dallas and such, but in McKinney/Allen she is fine. Maybe we can live near the campus without having to do a lot of traffic for her, but I don't know the areas very well."
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,BigBlue78,4,Fri Jun 19 16:06:55 2015 UTC,"So, I moved to Dallas after I graduated and I can relate to your concerns. Houston traffic, unlike DFW, is much more manageable if you take surface roads. The highways, in my opinion, are for commuters and should only be driven on during non-peak times. It is a much denser city than the DFW area so the distances you have to drive are much more manageable.  However, I am saying all of this without knowing what your other half will be doing in Houston. PM me if you want to chat without the whole world getting your story."
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,Pathis,3,Fri Jun 19 17:31:30 2015 UTC,The selling program teaches how to sell products and service. Every student has to sell spots on a golf tournament and some other things. On top of teaching to sell it is a GREAT networking opportunity you shouldn't pass up if you have the chance.   Living outside Houston might be a very long commute. Something like 30-45 minutes without traffic. Days with traffic.
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,Starlightbreaker,4,Fri Jun 19 15:09:53 2015 UTC,"The Program for Excellence in Selling is pretty well respected and I have heard only positive reviews from my friends who went through it. If nothing else, it is great resume fluff."

UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,BigBlue78,3,Sat Jun 20 00:07:05 2015 UTC,I also had a BLAST at the Hilton College. I was very active in Gourmet Night and the students who were a part of it are spectacularly talented. I recommend you try to get involved as soon as possible.  The area I found that I needed post-graduation was more business acumen. You may want to look into taking some classes or minoring in something at Bauer.  Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,Pathis,2,Fri Jun 19 15:06:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't been able to do gourmet night but it is a big deal around here. Maybe you could explain that more to OP. Also we have hall of honor think tanks. We have industry professionals come in and talk to the students about what it's like working in their field. The speakers that come are from all over in the industry. Stadium managers, spa managers, bakers, event managers, hotel managers, etc. you can ask questions during and many of the speakers are always happy to answer your questions after if they couldn't get to it in time."
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,Pathis,3,Fri Jun 19 15:21:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I did the tour they told me about Gourmet night and it sounds awesome. I already have an AAS in Culinary Arts, so I think I might be able to bring more to the table than the average student - and I'm pretty excited to have all these resources avalible that you guys talk about having like the professionals coming to talk, having so many job placement opportunities, etc.  It just seems like a great school, and I'm looking forward to going there. But one question I have is how are the non-major classes? And the major classes, are they smaller and more personal? Or large and impersonal?"
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,BigBlue78,3,Fri Jun 19 15:27:45 2015 UTC,"If you have an AAS, you will be a hot commodity for Gourmet Night. The first year, I was a kitchen 'Course Captain' (volunteer) because I found them at the student organization fair and signed up. The second year, I interviewed to be part of the event leadership (interview signups are IMMEDIATELY after Gourmet Night so if you snooze, you lose) and was selected to be 1 of 2 Sous. Once you are on the 'Leadership Team', as I was the 2nd year, you also have to sign up for the classroom component that counts toward your electives. The 3rd year, I was the Exec Chef. I cut class and worked for 2 weeks straight and went home to bed instead of the after party but I would not trade it for anything in the world. I mentioned all of that to say: I climbed the latter without any sort of formal culinary training just like the two Exec Chefs before me. You are very much at an advantage but you still need to climb the ladder and do your time.  The non-major classes can be impersonal. I took a Biology class with 500 of my closest friends and Algebra with 70 people. Then again, I also took Logic (which I HIGHLY recommend) with 15 people. On the flip side, I was also part of the Honors College and was able to use their two intro courses as Gen Ed credits and I had access to higher-level classes. For instance, instead of taking a cattle-call Government class, I was able to take a 2000-level American Foreign Policy class with 20 Poli Sci majors that was fantastic. I highly recommend the Honors College because it is a great way to meet people from around the campus while taking interesting classes.  As for Major classes, the required classes are held in giant lecture halls and thin out to between 20-30 students as they become more track-specific. There is a lot of interaction with the professor and other students. The professors ask that you form a relationship with them by talk to them after class and taking advantage of office hours, even if it is just to drop by and say ""hi"". I made the rounds a few times a semester and the profs became very understanding if I had any issues pop up. Also, most of the faculty has worked in the industry and know a LOT of people so they can be a useful resource when you graduate. The coursework is pretty easy and you probably have done a lot of it already if you have a culinary AAS. However, it is pretty easy because they expect you to hold down an industry job in addition to the coursework and student organizations."
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,Pathis,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:26:06 2015 UTC,"Have most of the professors been teaching for awhile? In general that is. I spent some time at UNT, and while they had a great Hospitality Management program, I felt a lot of the professors I had were still very young and inexperienced - some still in classes themselves."
UniversityOfHouston,3adg0n,BigBlue78,3,Fri Jun 19 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"Most of them have been around for a long time. There are sometimes a few graduate students teaching classes but they are usually VERY qualified. Take a look at the faculty directory here. The current dean, John Bowen, is taking a brief sabbatical then returning to teaching. The new dean is pretty impressive and will be great for the growing Wine & Spirits Institute within the college."

UniversityOfHouston,3a890h,VonKrauthammer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:20:32 2015 UTC,"I think you would be better off doing a major in a field that is different. An MBA would be better than another supply chain degree. I have a supply chain degree from UH and an MS in systems engineering from Johns Hopkins. I have noticed that I get good feedback from employers, headhunters and recruiters about the combination of education and how they compliment but work towards what I am trying to professional accomplish. My current employers likes that I have the breadth of education that is able to benefit me in my job since I have to work with engineering and construction."
UniversityOfHouston,3a890h,iburn319,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:15:29 2015 UTC,Ok. I do have an undergrad already in scm from UH. So getting another major is ridiculous. I can get an MBA or MS and still do well. I'm not going back for another bachelors
UniversityOfHouston,3a890h,iburn319,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:47:26 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if I fully understood your reply.  I'm saying that an MBA will be more beneficial in your situation than an MS in Supply chain.  An MS in Supply chain won't hurt you but it isn't differentiating yourself from what you already are.

I have been living on campus for 3 years, and I can tell you that depending on the location of the Engaged Learning Groups, and the type of EGL selected, there are different things to expect, but here is the gist:  Greater opportunities for interaction, similar classes/majors, similar age range, activities revolving the ELG type, and some other stuff in the same format. These are all things that can be done individually by constantly interacting with others and seeking out similar people if living in other residence halls or floors. I have lived here for 3 years, and I can assure you that the best way to receive the full benefit of your stay on campus would be to interact with your whole floor, invite them over to grab a bite, to chill in your room, to play pool, explore Houston, manage your fun with your classes. Attend events! Trust me on that one, even though they ""seem"" useless, go to them.

I would take any of them that you could at a community college around town if possible. All but petr 1111 should be avail at comm colleges.   Passing all the classes is manageable though. Cal III can be tough. Eng math isn't too difficult, but does require practice. Comp for eng depends on the prof. Matlab language is what you'll learn. Phys II isn't usually recommended by anyone to take at UH, but I've heard people say it wasn't too bad also. I would probably try to push phys II to another sem and take tech comm or some other easy class. I am not sure what your options are as a post bac.  Your study habits will dictate how well you do though."
UniversityOfHouston,38ihon,r56,4,Fri Jun 5 05:29:47 2015 UTC,"For engineering at least, this really isn't a bad load. Unless you're also trying to save money I'm not a fan of the idea of trying to take the early classes at community college, because a.) that involves going away from campus, and b.) shirking on difficulty isn't conducive to success in future engineering coursework. It just gets harder from here, so take this semester as an opportunity to get practice and make sure you can handle it - most can't.  Another important thing to note with engineering is that almost every class you take is a prerequisite for at least one more, so if you're considering putting a class off for a semester, make sure doing so won't delay your graduation. Always keep your degree flowchart handy."
UniversityOfHouston,38ihon,Sup6969,2,Sat Jun 6 14:32:15 2015 UTC,I was exactly in the same boat as you this past semester. I would highly recommend that you take uni physics 2 at hcc and calc 3 as well if you want to. Speaking from personal experience I was amazed on how much an easier time my friend had at hcc with those two classes. Uni Physics 2 and Calc 3 at uofh are no joke. Leave engineering Math for the next semester as 1331 is not exactly a cake walk. But your schedule depends on how much time and energy you are willing to put into your studies. If you are not participating in club activities and plan on spending the majority of your time studying then by all means take this schedule. But if I were given the choice I would take 4 or even 3 classes (don't drop intro to petroleum as it's only in fall).
UniversityOfHouston,38ihon,PastryDish,2,Sat Jun 6 08:56:26 2015 UTC,"Cal 3 was a joke class for me and most of my friends... I came from a community college (Lonestar) having  taken only Cal 1 & 2 at there. I decided to take Cal 3 at UH.   I never went to class, (which is totally unlike me) and learned it on my own with YouTube videos. I got an A in that class quote easy.   However, if you don't have good study habits or you struggled with past Calc classes, this one will be rough I guess.   In reality, Calc 3 is as easy as Cal 1 but in an extra dimension."

I would much rather a world where people didn't have guns, but we don't live in such a world.

The question isn't ""how to we eliminate gun crime"" it's ""why do we have 20x more homicides per 1000 than similar countries (like the UK).""  And the answer is, probably, social and health issues.  Unfortunately, Republicans won't fund social welfare and health care, so the only recourse to saving some of the 30,000 people who die from guns every year is to reduce the number of guns.  And guess what?  Every time it's been tried, it works - until Republicans repeal the law through the courts.

That's not at all what I said and I wonder if you took a glance at my post and instantly made up an assumption. I was arguing against the idea of gun free zones because the cat is already out of the bag. I absolutely believe that guns should be highly regulated, difficult to acquire, and ensure that any gun owner undergoes education to have respect for the powerful and dangerous thing they're purchasing.   I was hoping for a friendly debate which is why I included my thoughts questioning just how much more safe people are by owning guns.  I don't believe it's as much of a cut and dry issue as you make it sound. I personally would feel safer owning a gun, maybe not carrying it all the time, because I firmly believe that the illegal market for guns will go on just fine despite any legislation preventing or restricting private gun ownership.

The constitution doesn't say you can conceal a weapon on your person.   you unintentionally end up empowering the unrighteous (law-breaking) individuals who now have more ability to take advantage of defenseless people.   I think you don't understand the psychology of criminals very well.  Criminals aren't 'less likely' to rob people who they can't tell are armed.

You claim they are well trained for using their firearm, but the facts (ie, the CHL training materials) don't support this.  Your response to this fact was to say, ""Well, neither are cops!""

The reason he brings up the car break ins goes to show that someone could have stolen the gun from his car. Someone that's not approved by the state to have a gun is now running around on campus with someone else's gun. That someone has already shown how much they care for the law by breaking into someone else's car and taking what was not theirs.  I now give you a choice (and note that this is one of many choices, but I still want you to pick), who would you rather have in possession of the pistol: someone background checked and mentally screened, or someone who just broke several laws including what could be up to felony robbery."
UniversityOfHouston,38f0lq,InquisitiveLion,2,Sat Jun 6 04:40:49 2015 UTC,"I want to state that this law is not about affecting any specific situation. It's about simply not punishing CHL holders when they carry in a school.  CHL holders are 10x less likely to be convicted of crimes than everyone else in the entire State of Texas.  I would much rather have CHL holders carry a gun than not. A criminal would carry a gun regardless of the law, while a CHL holder willingly dearms himself if he is bound by law.  This law provides the University with free security everywhere there are CHL holders, while also promoting safer gun use, instead of simply flat out prohibiting all on campus.  This reminds me of sex ed classes. Would you rather have students practice safe sex or would you simply teach students not to have sex at all.

Just wish the university would take more action/responsibility in establishing a safer environment in which guns on campus is not even a topic of discussion.

Statistically, if you go somewhere off campus with 44 other people, one will be carrying a weapon, do you consider this in everyday life? What makes a university so much different than any of these other places?  Also, I don't understand that your concept of safety and your concept of guns are mutually exclusive.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say the person just wants your watch, they don't want to murder you or your family. If I'm at a University spending thousands of dollars, I shouldn't have to worry about my safety. Instead of addressing the problem, we're allowing unprepared, un-stress tested, 21 year old know it all's to have gun in a place of intellectual achievement.

I see it as being prepared to defend my life, and if all it takes is about 1/2 a pound of 'extra' weight on my side, I'm totally fine with that.  Let me ask you a question: Do you have fire a fire extinguisher in your car? how about in your house? If we don't plan on having a fire, than why bother having one? I keep one in my dorm just in case we have an electrical fire or something.   Right, they probably do want my watch, but what if they want something more? Remember when that woman was assaulted for just her phone by a group of minors? What if they had wanted more than just her phone and backpack? They already had her on the ground and they stomped on her. Shouldn't she have the right to her own safety and the right to respond with equal or greater force when her life is in danger?   Where are you getting this figure of 20,000 guns on campus? Using statistics from the general public, there would be about 2 dozen guns on campus.   They're very prepared, they have a shooting test similar to the police's requalification shooting test.   We've tried different solutions, like hiring 60 more unarmed security guards and having security escorts (when it's convenient for them, they will sometimes deny you the escort).  I live where the armed robbery was on campus, and it was very unsettling, my parents offered to have me live at home for the next few weeks, and I carry every tool I have at my disposal right now. I have mace and a taser (but those don't work at all) and neither of those would have stopped the robbery where the guy demonstrated he was more than willing to shoot someone. Keep in mind that that armed robbery was on campus, in a gun free zone, 20 yards away from where a security guard should have been stationed, and less than 300 yards from the police station.

I already graduated, but if I was still enrolled I would CCW on campus without thinking twice.   What always gets to me is when people that are against campus carry use reasoning like, ""everyone is going to have guns, and guns kill people, campus carry is making for a dangerous situation"".  My response to this is: If someone wants to cause harm with a gun they do not need a law stating it is legal to CONCEAL carry on a campus to start the next school shooting. People that do bad things typically are not going to let what is legal or illegal dictate if they do said bad thing.   If a school shooting were to happen I would feel way safer knowing there is a potential to take down the shooter with a legal CCW before he can harm more people.   I will concede one point to the people that are against campus carry: people make rash decisions when angry and we do NOT need students pulling out CCWs to settle petty arguments on campus.   That being said, pulling out your CCW for a reason other than to intimidate (without intent to cause harm) or as a last resort to save your life/property or another's life/property is illegal.   TL;DR: I agree with campus carry. People in the state of mind to cause harm with a weapon unjustly do not care if it is legal or illegal to bring said weapon to campus."

At the same time, don't be too ""excited"" about your new lease to shoot all the damn criminals you want. It might sound fun, but you have to live with any consequences that arise from shooting a firearm, and if you miss because you get anxious and jerk the trigger, you have to live with whatever damage that stray bullet does. Seeing the test for the CHL has me scared about the accuracy of carriers anyways: anything inside the 7 ring counts on a body poster from 15 feet? Way too inaccurate...

A CHL holder is trained to do anything but use his or her gun.  The thing about a CHL that I find scary isn't what happens before they pull out their gun, it's what happens after.  A criminal with a gun I know how to handle.  I've been the victim of personal violence before.  A 'law abiding vigilante' with a gun I have no way to predict, control or placate.

Criminals don't go to tactical trainings to improve their gangbanging.  I have much more experience than a civilian so I have no doubt I will hit my intended target.  Those who aren't as confident will also be less likely to draw their weapon and use it.  You are more likely to get shot by the criminal.    And not everyone with a CHL is a vigilante.  That and the hero complex crap is just silly.  We aren't running around to try and save the world from evil.  We have CHLs to protect ourselves.

A vigilante is:  a member of a self-appointed group of citizens who undertake law enforcement in their community without legal authority, typically because the legal agencies are thought to be inadequate.

At what ratio of mentally unstable people versus criminals versus good guys will total gun ownership become a problem.  Assume everyone has a gun, because if criminals have them, then the good guys should have them too. But within the good guys, you have mentally unstable people, bad shots, parents of sneaky children. This means that gun ownership should be limited to people who are trained and certified.  But lets go deeper. Guns are always shot to kill. Pointing a gun at someone means to intimidate and subdue with threat of death. By simply carrying a gun, you have power over others people's lives. Security regarding gun ownership is still very much against an unknown gun owner. How do we know if an unknown is a good guy or bad until after a tragedy has occurred. Am I surrounded by wolves or shepherds? This unknown I think is what many pro-gun control are afraid of. Clearly an officer of the peace is denoted as a known good guy, but a plainclothes civilian? Do I discriminate against people of color if they are carrying? Do I treat an old white  man carrying a gun the same as a young black man? Or by the way they dress? Do I report every unknown person I see carrying a weapon? Obviously a CHL owner will simply have to deal with constant reporting if not perfectly concealing their weapon.  Even then, why report people for having guns? Does it make anything safer? Is time reporting a CHL owner wasted when that time could have been spent catching real criminals?  Should CHL owners be known to the public? Will public flagging lower their safety during a criminal event? How do you keep people from pretending to be CHL owners?  This train of thought is going nowhere. Too many what ifs about other people. Owning a gun and carrying is meant for my own peace of mind that I can control a situation using intimidation and threat of death should the need arise. This is real life, not magical fairy land where murderers, rapists, and thieves do not exist. I want control over my own situation, not have others control it over me. And if it makes people feel so uneasy to see someone with a holstered gun, they can buy a bullet proof vest like the rest of us."

UniversityOfHouston,37wh49,ChristianC10,1 point,Sat May 30 23:47:02 2015 UTC,Harvest hill near the med center is running me ~$800
UniversityOfHouston,37wh49,nomnomnaan,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:20:57 2015 UTC,"I just saw this.  I'm also looking for an apartment close to campus, but I currently live in Illinois so it's hard to get a feel for them. How do you like Harvest Hill? It initially popped up on my list of places to look in to, but the reviews were pretty bad (and there were a lot of them)."
UniversityOfHouston,37wh49,nagarrow,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:08:11 2015 UTC,"So i did this apartment hunt back in January for the spring semester, its not fun. Keep in mind this is my first apartment, but what i've learned about the area is that it's all obviously pretty old and some of the reviews are outdated. Harvest Hill for me has been great, i made sure to get an upstairs unit (both cheaper and less chance of bugs/shit, and renovated-ish). The reviews for this place made it seem pretty bad, but i've literally only seen 2 bugs in 6 months, parking is always available, and the staff is helpful. I also do make sure to get on the pesticide list once a month or so to stay ahead of it. I think being upstairs helps a lot with this.   A big thing for the area is it's hard to tell what's decent online, like Holly Hall (more expensive, older, IMO it's a LOT sketchier, cramped kitchen, and management was not interested in helping at all), and Scotland Yard (believe those reviews, they aren't lying, its bad). Almeda was my second choice, but they were charging a good amount more than Harvest Hill and I didnt see it being worth it while touring. On the other hand, the Med Center area is awesome! it's safer than being close to campus, food is everywhere, groceries are a 1 minute drive, it takes ~10 min to get to campus with light morning traffic, 288 will be your main artery into the city, and it's next to the UT Housing and Dental school so it's decently watched over (i see 2 patrol cars every morning). Roads are shit, like really shit, but they've been working on that.   In the end i settled for what was affordable and decent for me and unless i spend over $1000 I really dont expect more, i'm really happy with my place.  Sorry for the essay, but when I was searching I was looking for this kind of information!  If you have any more questions feel free to ask!"
UniversityOfHouston,37wh49,nomnomnaan,2,Thu Jun 11 15:35:25 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you get what you pay for. A decent apartment that will get the job done, but not with the bells and whistles you'd get paying >$1000 or commuting from farther distances.  I appreciate the detail in your response; It's exactly what I was hoping to learn about. I'm well aware that consumer reviews are generally skewed in a negative direction when it comes to housing and it's great to get a more holistic picture."
UniversityOfHouston,37qefr,kristephe,8,Fri May 29 15:55:47 2015 UTC,"I believe this is on the list of lots that will be worked on over the summer...  You should consider telling your SGA representative to tell TPAC (transportation and parking advisory committee), now that they are actually showing up to the meetings.  The meeting is open, so you could also ask and be put on the agenda."
UniversityOfHouston,37qefr,coaxfun,1 point,Fri May 29 16:44:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, interesting. Thanks for the info!  I did try to do some clicking around on facilities site to see if there was any mention of plans to work on it but I didn't see it at the time. I'm actually a former grad student and now staff member so I guess I'd have to go about it in a different way. I sent an email to parking and transportation just mentioning politely that I thought it was a hazard and asking for more info on if they had plans to fix it. Just figured if it wasn't already in the works that more people asking about it might get it going.   Even if they do fix it, what still baffles me the most is why it wasn't done when the rest of the lot was paved."
UniversityOfHouston,37qefr,coaxfun,1 point,Fri May 29 16:51:31 2015 UTC,"Probably ran out of money...  Many maintenance projects for last year were deferred because the planning happen the previous year, when we were short on funds.  Now that work is finally being done.  Since you're a staff member, you can contact your staff council rep (there are three on TPAC).  There's a list of members on the TPAC website."
UniversityOfHouston,37qefr,yolonazi,-1,Fri May 29 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"I park in this lot every time I drive to campus and purposefully avoid the rows with gravel. I am really curious as to understand why these rows were not paved like the rest of the lot which is quite nice.   I found this document put online by a professor that mentions the issues even last fall. For a university publicly pushing it's Tier 1 status, campus improvements, and the beautiful new light rail line, this simple issue is a road hazard, not to mention that they rarely dry up and standing water is a breeding ground for disease carrying mosquitoes that Houston doesn't not need more of."
UniversityOfHouston,37qefr,yolonazi,4,Fri May 29 15:59:32 2015 UTC,lol why does everything have to be a disgrace to our 'tier 1' status? parking lot maintenance and research grants have no correlation. but yeah I see what you mean. Once the water dries up they should pave that lot. Its not easy to get rid of standing water especially after a storm of such proportions.
UniversityOfHouston,37qefr,Gh0stw0lf,3,Fri May 29 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"It's been like this for over a year. Yeah, it would be tough to get the standing water out but it would dry up if it was pumped out. I mentioned the Tier 1 Status because I feel like the university flaunts it more than many other Tier 1 schools and doesn't necessarily fully explain the designation.  I realize that research grants are separate from parking lot funding but for a school who is deliberately trying to get more public attention with better sports teams, facilities (sports, academic, housing, dining), etc that they should make sure the basics are taken care of."
UniversityOfHouston,37qefr,Takeme2yourleader,-4,Fri May 29 16:24:42 2015 UTC,well they flaunt their status because its a big achievement for them. UH doesn't have a rich history of producing a lot of academics or substantial research but tier 1 status paves the way for great things to come in the future. its more of an advertisement to academicians than students  and yes they should do something about the lots. its a mess. but let me point out that even ivy league universities have issues like this. the people in charge of making the university tier 1 (or at least have the qualities of a tier 1 university) aren't the same people who look at parking and transportation. its more of an administrative issue. but yeah they should definitely do something about these issues.
UniversityOfHouston,37qefr,Gh0stw0lf,8,Fri May 29 16:35:05 2015 UTC,UH doesn't have a rich history of producing a lot of academics or substantial research.    This is just not true at all.
UniversityOfHouston,37r9m6,cameron0208,10,Fri May 29 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"I'm so unsure with UH policies sometimes. It's trying to transition to be more like other universities (which is fine) but often times screws the kids that were stuck in limbo or working towards original goals. (See: Petroleum Engineering courses and requirements). They really, really need grandfather clauses with some of these things but oh well, I'm not even sure who you can talk to about that.   On to your point, if you don't like economics don't do it. The temptation of getting a degree just to graduate is tempting but it might leave you in a worse position in the long run.   I actually remember your original post and I always wondered how that turned out. It sucks so hard that they're doing that to you. I'm assuming emailing Khator didn't help?   In the summer, look for jobs you'd like to have and degrees people in those jobs. Just know it's not too late, UH may have told you no but after you graduate it's still possible to get a job doing what you wanted through a different route. It happens in engineering all the time, alot of engineers don't have engineering degrees.   Anyway, I hope you're not down man. Take this time to reflect on how else you can get what you want. If you really want it, there are still ways even if it isn't through UH.   OR you can choose something else entirely that you think you could have a passion for.  Good luck."
UniversityOfHouston,37r9m6,Gh0stw0lf,3,Fri May 29 20:04:39 2015 UTC,"They really left me out to dry on this one. I wish they had a grandfather clause or something. But the fact they are not even willing to work with my on anything is pretty discouraging.   I definitely don't want to do economics. In the long run, I would like to do portfolio management or investment banking, which economics would be good for. Obviously, I was trying to do finance. Either way, the fact I'm not good at eco is what bothers me. Not sure if it's me, or the bad teachers. Also scary to realize I can't find ANY good eco professors on RMP.com.   E-mailing Khator did not do anything unfortunately. And the only response I got out of 2 different high-ups in Bauer was a resounding 'No'.   I think my biggest battle now is that finance is all I really wanted to do, so now I don't really know what else I want to do. I guess that's an entirely different search altogether though.   I'm not down, slightly discouraged and scared though. I definitely need to take some time to figure all this out. I really appreciate your words!"
UniversityOfHouston,37r9m6,harrytrum4n,1 point,Sat May 30 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"IB isn't realistic at this point. Maybe take another Econ class or two and really keep an open mind about the subject. Don't enter the course with a negative impression about the profs. UH has an incredible Econ dept and you get out of it what you put in. The RMP.com ratings are just off. Most people rate based on their final grade and how easy the class was. Seriously, the Econ profs are top-notch. Econometrics and statistics is a better indication of advanced Econ compared to intro micro/macro so take a few quant based courses if you can. Consider this Bauer bs as an opportunity to try other non-standard routes. Business school majors with average gpas are everywhere. If you're smart (you need to do a better job of showing it with your low gpa) econ is significantly better than anything you can do at Bauer. Go with it."
UniversityOfHouston,37r9m6,smoky_bourbon,5,Mon Jun 1 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"How far away would you be from a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Business Option? You said you were  good at math and have already taken business courses. If you are good with computers, it might be a good fit. It would probably lead to a higher paying career than an Economics degree."
UniversityOfHouston,37r9m6,pdx_jewshua,3,Sat May 30 18:07:44 2015 UTC,"I agree this would be more what OP wants in comparison to Economics, however, you hurt me with the higher paying career because it is probably true :("
UniversityOfHouston,37r9m6,smoky_bourbon,3,Sat May 30 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean any offense. Someone I know graduated from A&M with an economics degree and could not find a good paying job. He eventually went back to school and got a nursing degree. His problem was that he didn't plan for a career until after he had graduated. If you've got a good plan and make good grades, economics could lead to a nice, high-paying career. Computer science, though, is a good option for OP because he doesn't seem to have such a plan."
UniversityOfHouston,37r9m6,pdx_jewshua,2,Sun May 31 02:34:12 2015 UTC,"Speaking from experience, if you did not breeze through the freshman level econ courses, the advanced level classed will be hell for you. You can try and go the more mathy econ classes, like econometrics, game theory, data mining, etc; but realistically you will have to take an international monetary course which is macro on steroids.    But, seems like you already know that. My best advice would be to go through the Econ advisers instead of Bauer, if you haven't already. Ms Foley generally is too swamped with work to worry about rules so making an appointment and giving her your story might get you further in the long run."
UniversityOfHouston,37r9m6,sirjackiechiles,1 point,Sat May 30 18:38:09 2015 UTC,"Boul is probably the best professor in the Econ department.

It really depends on your major and what you plan on  doing after graduation. I heard if you plan on getting a PhD or masters its great because it prepares you by making you do a thesis."
UniversityOfHouston,36x11p,thecaprisunkid,6,Fri May 22 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"For the vast majority of people I know who started in the Honors College - myself included - the answer is an emphatic no, it is definitely not worth it. You have to figure it out for yourself, but for most of us, what you get is not nearly worth all of the extra effort and stress required.  The coursework is significantly more difficult - Human Sit. alone is a nightmare of a freshman class if you aren't already coming in as a great English student.  And it looks better to have a stellar GPA without Honors College honors. Especially if you're thinking about grad school. Your GPA, especially the last ~60 hours, is very important for grad school applications."
UniversityOfHouston,36x11p,yakovgolyadkin,2,Sat May 23 03:24:04 2015 UTC,"This is truth right here, but I want to add something.  Having had both a high gpa student worker and a honors student worker, the biggest difference I saw was that honors seems to have made a better, more studious person.  I mean, they were both very engaged, and high performing.  The subtle difference was, the high gpa student asked a lot of questions, and devoured info.  The honors student asked fewer, and appeared less engaged, but absorbed more information and seemed better at figuring out stuff on their own.  Which was better?  I dunno if I can say for sure.  It really depends.  I'd say, a high GPA student will get the job just as easily, but in some cases, the honors student may perform better.  It could very well depend on the employer and even the manager that receives them.    Small sample size though.  I think you have to decided whether you need the skills that honors might get you."
UniversityOfHouston,36x11p,coaxfun,7,Sat May 23 03:31:39 2015 UTC,"You get priority enrollment, only people who get to enroll before you are athletes. That was the biggest benefit.   I can't say for every employer obviously but when I interviewed, being in the Honors College was impressive to people.   The advisors are good and it's a lot easier to get an appointment.  Certain colleges are better for Honors students. For instance, business majors practically have their own honors college, and almost every class until your senior year is offered and easy to get into.   The classes are smaller, and honestly I did much better in my honors courses than my regular ones. Generally they're not much harder, they're very different though.   If you have any questions, I don't mind answering them."

UniversityOfHouston,36x11p,UHRossy,3,Sat May 23 01:39:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there is. I forget exactly how it's worded, but there's ""With Honors"" which is magna, summa cum laude and then there's in Honors (I think that's how it's worded) which you can only get if you join the Honors College. You can get both, too. I haven't gotten mine yet, but you also get a separate diploma sort of thing for the Honors College. In Honors is written on your diploma I believe."

Honors in Major: Complete a senior thesis. University Honors and Honors in Major: Both of the above. This is the one they keep hyping up to all of the potential Honors College students as though you're definitely going to get it. For the CLASS graduation this year - the largest college in the university - a grand total of 11 people got that, and around 70 graduated from the Honors College. Collegiate Honors: Some Honors coursework or an Honors minor. Membership in Honors College: This is listed in the graduation program in the ""Honors"" section, and seems pretty self-explanatory. Be in the Honors College but don't complete the necessary requirements for any of the above levels of honors.

UniversityOfHouston,36x11p,SometimesY,5,Thu Jul 16 07:53:15 2015 UTC,"Uh if you're already a student, as in you have already taken the first year courses, I would say not. You'll have to retake a bunch in that honors college from what I recall. If you're in STEM, it's really not going to do much for you.  Honors really doesn't factor into any serious decisions, it's just a good experience when you're a student. It's a smaller community (with some really awesome advisors) with lots of stuff going on, but I don't think many employers will care that you did or didn't do honors if your resume and transcript are both pretty strong."

The stadium held about 80 people for other athletic sports events so to me, it felt like they found a ""need"" to fit for their excuse to spend money. The roads and parking lots were still gravel but MAN WE NEEDED A NEW STADIUM. Our students were getting robbed every week but WE NEED A NEW STADIUM."
UniversityOfHouston,36u2lr,kin670,2,Sat May 23 03:52:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Robertson wouldn't have been considered structurally sound to use after another year or two anyways. It was literally falling apart.   Also, I'm pretty sure the roads are the city's responsibility and we have no control over those.  Plus you're seeing the results of that stadium now. Two really good recruits in the past few days. We attracted a big name head coach, and he'll I'd be willing to say that it probably played a good role in landing Sampson too."

What is your non edu degree and did you conduct your student teaching through UH? UH has to recommend you take your tests for teaching certification and we normally do that while students are going through their student teaching. You can't simply graduate and take a test and begin to teach. The Texas Education Agency requires individuals go through a certification program, which is why I asked if you did student teaching with us as it would indicate you went through our program. If the answer is yes, you can possibly be approved to take the test. If not, there are a variety of options to get certified that I could tell you about - some at UH and some not. Feel free to PM too if that's easier."

This person will most likely be the person in charge of handing out financial aid however if the stipulations are explicit (meaning if they lay out firm requirements when you accepted the scholarship), then they likelihood of you keeping your scholarship will be reduced. However ALWAYS ask and push it don't take the first no that you're given (Good advice in your career/academic/professional life).  That being said: 3.23 overall still isn't bad from a 3.51. That sounds like you got hit with a B- in a class. Don't sweat it man, most kids in the engineering college would kill to have that GPA. Anything over a 2.75 (at least in petr) is good."

He had obviously prepared the speech, but he spoke extemporaneously.  The guy's very smart, has a very rich vocabulary and very new agey ideas about stuff. He 's sort of a hippie and proud of it.  He peppered his speech with quite a few 4 letter words and talked on several occasions about drugs. One anecdote he told seemed obvious he was high when it occurred. Another time he told a story about a singer who was addicted to Coke (McConaughey didn't say Coke but the 'white stuff') and how he decided to turn the page, leaving his bad habits behind. McConaughey said he'd had to do the same thing.  It was a lively speech and for once not your usual Commencement Speech drivel."

His examples - the guy you owe money to, pay him instead of having to hide from him, that married woman you're going to sleep with, don't, and don't sleep around if married.

Matthews was great... that shit was horrible. He prepared nothing and insulted numerous groups of people who he didnt consider ""winners.""

UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,coogie,7,Sat May 16 03:09:35 2015 UTC,Eh he donated all of the money to his charity.
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,SometimesY,4,Sat May 16 03:13:21 2015 UTC,"80% of it to charity. Specifically his charity. The other 20% - about $25,000 - goes to the booking agency that connected UH with him."
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,yakovgolyadkin,7,Sat May 16 03:19:09 2015 UTC,So what if it's his charity
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,jayhawk6677,0,Sat May 16 03:23:46 2015 UTC,So nothing. I was just specifying the charity the money is going to. Is that a problem?
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,yakovgolyadkin,0,Sat May 16 19:33:59 2015 UTC,Thought you were making a big deal about it...so nah
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,jayhawk6677,2,Sun May 17 02:29:08 2015 UTC,Someone has to make money from this deal.
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,master_west,2,Sat May 16 09:56:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the correction. I had heard on 11 that it was 100% but what you say makes more sense.
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,SometimesY,-5,Sat May 16 03:25:40 2015 UTC,"Be that as it may, the university is still out the $135,000.  It doesn't matter if it was donated (likely after the amount of money paid came into the limelight) or he spent it on bongos, that's money that was for the university and now will have to be made up somewhere else.  edit Downvote me if you want, but I got two degrees from U of H and paid every penny out of pocket while I was working and going to school.  I worked very hard for that money working nights and weekends while many others were out partying.  Each year my tuition went up without mercy at a time when I could least afford it and after deregulation in 2002, my tuition and fees even jumped up 30% in one semester.  Each time it went up, I heard the school tell us the economy was slowing down, there were budget cuts from the state, not enough corporate sponsorship, etc. etc. etc. and we had to make sacrifices.  It pains me to see that not only the entire money that I put into the university (I'm guessing around 30 grand) was just wasted in a one hour speech, but the money other students paid for the entirety of their education also disappeared for a publicity stunt which will pay little dividends.     How will this look when the Alumni Association calls students and asks for donations?  They used to call and say ""Hi, this is so and so from the NSM and we just upgraded our building and could really use a donation"".  Now they'll say ""Sorry, we just blew $135,000 on an actor and next year we want to get the Kardashians so can you spare a few bucks?""     I've already paid my dues so this won't affect me directly and I shouldn't care, but it just doesn't look like the university's decisions are made with the students in mind and more the egos of those in power."
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,coogie,7,Sat May 16 12:07:36 2015 UTC,God you're so naive for someone who graduated with an MBA. This 135K investment is going to bring back millions in extra applications UH gets by being trending on social media. Not to mention the millions in donations from alumni that will start rolling in. Not even factoring in that the speakers we got previously were probably paid ~50K.
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,vladthepoker,0,Sat May 16 17:49:24 2015 UTC,"I think it has the opposite effect on alumni, but I guess we'll find out.  As for advertising, we're not University of Phoenix.  People either want to come here for an education or they don't."
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,coogie,3,Sun May 17 06:04:25 2015 UTC,"Totally incorrect. UH doubled applications after a UH/Miami football game was on ESPN in the mid 2000's. Why do you think Harvard sends paper apps to every high school senior every year? It is advertisement, plain and simple. More people apply, lower % accepted, higher school ranking, more people apply, lower % accepted, etc etc."
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,vladthepoker,5,Sun May 17 14:34:50 2015 UTC,"This has been the cheapest advertising UH has ever purchased. I don't think the ROI will be millions like the other response, but this is actually one of the smarter things I've seen the university do."
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,The_Broet,2,Sat May 16 21:57:04 2015 UTC,National publicity for UH is worth it too

UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,daswarser,9,Sat May 16 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"Short and sweet or long and salty? A sugar donut or some oatmeal? Out of respect for you and your efforts in getting your degree, I thought long and hard about what I could share with you tonight. Did I want to stand at a podium and read you your rights? Did I want to come up here and just share some really funny stories? I thought about what you would WANT. I thought about what you might NEED. I also thought about what I WANT to say. What I NEED to say‚Ä¶ Hopefully, we‚Äôll both be happy on both accounts‚Ä¶ And as the saying goes, take what you like, leave the rest. Thank you for having me.    So, before I share with you some ‚Äúwhat I do knows,‚Äù let‚Äôs talk about a ‚Äúwhat I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù    I have 2 older brothers.    One was in high school in the early 1970s‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa time when a high school GED got you a job and college degree was exemplary.    My other brother was in HS in the early 1980s, and by this time the GED wasn‚Äôt enough to guarantee employment, you needed a college degree, and if you got one, you had a pretty good chance of getting the kind of job you wanted after you graduated.    Me, I graduated HS in 1988, got my college degree in ‚Äô93. That college degree? Didn‚Äôt mean as much. No ticket, no voucher, no free pass go to anything.    So, what does your college degree mean?    It means you got an education, means you have more knowledge in a specific subject, vocation, means you may have more expertise in ‚Äúwhat your degree‚Äù is in.    But what is it worth? In the job market? Today?    We know the market for college graduates is more competitive now than ever.    And some of you already have a job lined up, a path where today‚Äôs job can become tomorrow‚Äôs career, but for most of you, the future‚Äôs probably still pretty fuzzy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou don‚Äôt have that job that directly reflects the degree you just got, and many of you don‚Äôt even have a job at all. You‚Äôve just completed your scholastic educational curriculum in life‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe one you started when you were 5 years old up until now‚Ä¶ and your future, your ‚Äúdays to come,‚Äù may be no more clear than it was 5 years ago‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou don‚Äôt have all the answers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand it‚Äôs scary.    And that‚Äôs OK, because hey, that‚Äôs how it is, this is the reality you face‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe world we live in‚Ä¶And while I‚Äôm not here to discourage you or in any way belittle your accomplishments of which we celebrate tonight‚Ä¶I am here to talk brass tacks, to skip the flattery and the ‚Äúattaboys‚Äù because I DO know this.    The sooner we become LESS IMPRESSED‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith our life, our accomplishments, our career, the prospect in front of us. As soon as we become LESS IMPRESSED‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand MORE INVOLVED with these things, the sooner we get a whole lot better at doing them.    So, I‚Äôm going to talk to you about some things I‚Äôve learned along my journey‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämost from experience, some I heard in passing, many I‚Äôm still practicing, but ALL of them, true.    Yes, they may be truths to me, but don‚Äôt think that that makes them MINE‚Ä¶ because you can‚Äôt own a truth. Think of these as signposts, approaches, paradigms, that give some science to satisfaction. They are yours to steal, to share, to liken to your own lives, and to personally apply in your OWN lives, in your own way, should you choose to.    1. Life is not easy‚Ä¶    NUMBER 1, LIFE‚ÄôS NOT EASY‚Ä¶don‚Äôt try and make it that way. It‚Äôs not fair, it never was, it isn‚Äôt now, it won‚Äôt ever be. Do not fall into the entitlement trap of feeling you are a victim, you are not. Get over it and get on with it. And yes, most things are more rewarding when you break a sweat to get em.    2. ‚ÄúUnbelievable‚Äù is the stupidest word in the dictionary    It shouldn‚Äôt ever come out of our mouths.    To say, ‚ÄúWhat an unbelievable play!‚Äù It was an unbelievable book, film, act of courage‚Ä¶really?    It may be spectacular, phenomenal, most excellent and outstanding‚Ä¶ but unbelievable? NO. Give others and yourself more credit. It just happened, you witnessed it, you just did it, believe it.    How about the other side of unbelievable? When we humans ‚Äúunder perform‚Äù or act OUT of character?‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äúman flies a suicide jet into the World Trade Center, millions die from diseases that we have cures for, Bob the builder swears he‚Äôll have your house built by Thanksgiving and you can‚Äôt move in ‚Äôtil Christmas, THE NEXT YEAR‚Ä¶‚Äù Our best friend lies to us, and WE, lie to our self, all the time‚Ä¶unbelievable? I don‚Äôt think so.. Again, it just happened, and it happens everyday ‚Ä¶    NOTHING we homosapien earthlings do is unbelievable‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone thing you can depend on people being‚Ä¶is people. So we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised, we are the trickiest mammal walking the planet!! (It ain‚Äôt the monkeys I‚Äôm worried about, it‚Äôs you and me.)    Acknowledge acts of greatness as real, and do NOT be naive about mankind‚Äôs capacity for evil nor be in denial of our own shortcomings.    NOTHING we do is unbelievable. Stupid word. Un-be-lievably stupid word.    3. Happiness is different than Joy    ‚ÄúI just want to be happy.‚Äù I hear that all the time. But what IS happiness? Happiness is an emotional response to an outcome‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIf I win I will be happy, if I don‚Äôt I won‚Äôt. An if-then, cause and effect, quid pro quo standard that we cannot sustain because we immediately raise it every time we attain it. You see, happiness demands a certain outcome, it is result reliant.    If happiness is what you‚Äôre after, then you are going to be let down frequently and be unhappy much of your time. Joy, though, is something else. It‚Äôs not a choice, not a response to some result, it is a constant. Joy is ‚Äúthe feeling we have from doing what we are fashioned to do,‚Äù no matter the outcome.    Personally, as an actor, I started enjoying my work and literally being happier when I stopped trying to make the daily labor a means to a certain end‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI need this film to be a box office success, I need my performance to be acknowledged, I need the respect of my peers.    All reasonable aspirations but truth is, as soon as the WORK, the MAKING of the movie, the DOING of the deed became the reward in itself‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI got more box-office, more accolades and respect than I‚Äôd ever had before. See, JOY is always in process, under construction‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs in the constant approach, alive and well ‚Äîin the DOING of what we are fashioned to do‚Ä¶ and enJOYing doing it.    4. Define Success For Yourself    I went to a voodoo shop south of New Orleans a few years back‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey had vials of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù potions stacked in columns with headings above each defining what they would give you‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFertility, Health, Family, Legal Help, Energy, Forgiveness, Money.    Guess which column was empty? Money. Let‚Äôs admit it, ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is king today, makes the world go round. Money is SUCCESS, the more we have, the more ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù we are, right?    I‚Äôd argue that our cultural values have even been financialized‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähumility is not in vogue anymore, it‚Äôs too passive. It‚Äôs a get rich quick on the internet, 15 minutes of fame world we live in. See it every day.    But, we all want to succeed right? Question we have to ask ourselves is, what success is to us, what success is to YOU. More money? OK, I got nothing against money. But maybe it‚Äôs a healthy family? A happy marriage? To help others? To be famous? To be spiritually sound? To leave the world a little bit better place than you found it?    Continue to ask yourself that question. Your answer may change over time and that‚Äôs fine, but do yourself this favor:    WHATEVER your answer is, DON‚ÄôT CHOOSE ANYTHING THAT WILL JEOPARDIZE YOUR SOUL. PRIORITIZE WHO YOU ARE, WHO YOU WANT TO BE, AND DON‚ÄôT SPEND TIME WITH ANYTHING THAT ANTAGONIZES YOUR CHARACTER. DON‚ÄôT DRINK THE KOOL AID!! It tastes sweet today but it will give you cavities tomorrow. Life is not a popularity contest. Be brave, take the hill but first, answer the question, ‚ÄúWhat is my hill?‚Äù    How do I define success? For me, it‚Äôs a measurement of five things‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfatherhood, being a good husband, health, career, friendships. These are what‚Äôs important to me in my life.    So, I try to measure these five each day, check in with them, see whether or not I‚Äôm in the debit or the credit section with each one. Am I in the red or in the black with each of them?    For instance, sometimes my career is rolling (in the black) but I see how my relationship with my wife could use a little more attention. I gotta pick up the slack on being a better husband, get that one out of the red. Or say my spiritual health could use some maintenance (red) but hey, my friendships and social life are in high gear (black)‚Ä¶ I gotta recalibrate, checks and balances, go to church, remember to say thank you more often. I gotta take the tally. Because I want to keep ALL 5 in healthy shape, and I know that if I DON‚ÄôT take care of them, if I don‚Äôt keep up maintenance on them, ONE of them is going to get weak, dip too deep into the debit section, go bankrupt, get sick‚Ä¶ die even.    So first, we have to DEFINE success for ourselves, then we have to put in the work to MAINTAIN it‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätake our daily tally, tend our garden, keep the things that are important to us in good shape.    Let‚Äôs admit it, we all got two wolves in us, a good one and a bad one, you know what I‚Äôm talking about‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand they BOTH wanna eat‚Ä¶ We just gotta feed that good wolf a little more than the other one."
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,coaxfun,6,Mon May 18 01:35:30 2015 UTC,"5. Process of elimination is the first step to our identity ( a.k.a where you are NOT is as important as where you are)    In 1992, I got my first job as an actor. Three lines, three days work, in a film called Dazed and Confused. Alright.    Alright, Alright, Alright.    The director, Richard Linklater, kept inviting me back to set each night, putting me in more scenes which led to more lines all of which I happily said YES to. I was having a blast. People said I was good at it, they were writing me a check for $325 a day. I mean hell yeah, give me more scenes, I love this!! And by the end of the shoot those 3 lines had turned into over 3 weeks work and ‚Äúit was Wooderson‚Äôs ‚Äô70 Chevelle we went to get Aerosmith tickets in.‚Äù Bad ass.    Well, a few years ago I was watching the film again and I noticed two scenes that I really shouldn‚Äôt have been in. In one of the scenes, I exited screen left to head somewhere, then re-entered the screen to ‚Äúdouble check‚Äù if any of the other characters wanted to go with me. Now, in rewatching the film, (and you‚Äôll agree if you know Wooderson), he was not a guy who would ever say, ‚Äúlater,‚Äù and then COME BACK to ‚Äúsee if you were sure you didn‚Äôt wanna come with him..‚Äù No, when Wooderson leaves, Wooderson‚Äôs gone, he doesn‚Äôt stutter step, flinch, rewind, ask twice, or solicit, right? He just ‚Äúlikes those high school girls cus he gets older and they stay the same age.‚Äù    My point is, I should NOT have been in THAT scene, I should have exited screen left and never come back.    But back then, making my first film, getting invited back to set, cashing that check and having a ball, I WANTED more screen time, I WANTED to be in the scene longer and more, and come back into the scene right?    I shouldn‚Äôt have been there. Wooderson shouldn‚Äôt have been there.  It‚Äôs just as important where we are not as it is where we are.    The first step that leads to our identity in life is usually NOT ‚ÄúI know who I am,‚Äù but rather ‚ÄúI know who I AM NOT.‚Äù Process of elimination.    Defining ourselves by what we are NOT is the first step that leads us to really KNOWING WHO WE ARE.    You know that group of friends you hang out with that really don‚Äôt bring out your best? They gossip too much, or they‚Äôre kind of shady, and they really aren‚Äôt gonna be there for you in a pinch? Or how about that bar we keep going to that we always seem to have the worst hangover from? Or that computer screen that keeps giving us an excuse not to get out of the house and engage with the world and get some HUMAN interaction? Or how about that food we keep eating? Tastes so good going down but makes us feel like crap the next week when we feel lethargic and keep putting on weight?    Those people, those places, those things‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSTOP giving them your TIME and ENERGY. Don‚Äôt GO there, put them DOWN‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand when you DO quit giving them your time, you inadvertently find yourself spending MORE time and in more PLACES that are more healthy for YOU, that bring YOU more joy‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWHY?    Because you just eliminated the who‚Äôs, the where‚Äôs, the what‚Äôs and the when‚Äôs that were keeping you from your identity. Trust me, too many options makes a tyrants of us all. So get rid of the excess, the wasted time, decrease your options‚Ä¶ and you will have accidentally, almost innocently, put in front of you, what is important to you by process of elimination.    Knowing who we ARE is hard. Give yourself a break. Eliminate who you are NOT first, and you‚Äôll find yourself where you need to be.    6. DON‚ÄôT LEAVE CRUMBS‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the beauty of delayed gratification    What are crumbs? The crumbs I‚Äôm talking about are the choice we make that make us have to look over our shoulder in the future.    You didn‚Äôt pay that guy back the money you owed him and tonight you just saw him sitting 3 rows behind you‚Ä¶shit‚Ä¶You slept around on your spouse and you just found out that tomorrow, she and the lady you‚Äôre having an affair with, are going to be at the same PTA meeting‚Ä¶shit again.. You drank too much last night and you‚Äôre too hungover to drive your son to his 8 a.m. Saturday morning baseball practice. THESE ARE CRUMBS! They come in the form of regret, guilt, and remorse‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou leave em today, they will cause you more stress tomorrow, and they DISALLOW you from creating a customized future in which you DO NOT have to look over your shoulder.    So‚Ä¶let‚Äôs flip the script. Instead of creating outcomes that take FROM us, let‚Äôs create MORE outcomes that pay us BACK, fill us up, keep your fire lit, turn you ON, for the most amount of TIME in your future.    These are the choices I speak of and this is the beauty of delayed gratification.    Tee yourself up. Do yourself a favor. Make the choices, the purchase TODAY that PAYS you back TOMORROW. RESIDUALS. In my business, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúmailbox money.‚Äù I do my job well today, I get checks in the mailbox five years from now‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääheck of a deal.    So, whether its prepping the coffee maker the night before so all you gotta do is press the button in the morning, or getting ready for the job interview early so you don‚Äôt have to cram the night before, or choosing not to hook up with that married woman because you know you‚Äôll feel horrible about it tomorrow (and her husband carries a gun), or paying your debts on time so when you do see that guy three rows back tonight‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou don‚Äôt have to hunker down in your seat hoping he don‚Äôt see you. Get some R.O.I‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäRETURN ON INVESTMENT‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäYour investment. You. You customize your future.    DON‚ÄôT LEAVE CRUMBS.    7. DISSECT YOUR SUCCESSES (and the reciprocity of gratitude)    We so often focus on our FAILURES. We study them. We obsess on them. We DISSECT them. We end up intoxicated with them to the point of disillusion.    When do we write in our diary? When we‚Äôre depressed. What do we gossip about? Other people‚Äôs flaws and limitations. We can dissect ourselves into self loathing if we‚Äôre not careful‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I find that most of the times our obsession with what is wrong just breeds more wrong and more failure.    The easiest way to dissect success is though gratitude. Giving thanks for that which we do have, for what is working, appreciating the simple things we sometimes take for granted. We give thanks for these things and that gratitude reciprocates, creating more to be thankful for. It‚Äôs simple, and it works.    I‚Äôm not saying be in denial of your failures. No, we can learn from them too, but only if we look at them constructively. As a means to reveal what we are good at, what we can get better at, what we do succeed at.    I‚Äôve read a lot of my bad reviews, and the good ‚Äúbad reviews,‚Äù written by the more talented critics, are constructive. They reveal to me what did translate in my work, what came across, what was seen, or what wasn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt obsess on the unfavorable aspect of their review, but I do seek what I can learn from it‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBecause their displeasure actually uncovers and makes more apparent what I do do well, what I am successful at‚Ä¶ and then I dissect that.    Life is a verb. We try our best. We don‚Äôt always do our best. Well, architecture is a verb as well. And since we are the architects of our lives, lets study the habits, the practices, the routines we have that lead to and feed our success‚Ä¶ our joy, our honest pain, our laughter, our earned tears‚Ä¶Let‚Äôs Dissect THAT and give thanks for THOSE things‚Ä¶ and when we do that what happens? We get better at them‚Ä¶and have more to dissect.    8. MAKE VOLUNTARY OBLIGATIONS    Mom and dad teach us things as children. Teachers, mentors, the government and laws all give us guidelines to navigate life, rules to abide by in the name of accountability.    I‚Äôm not talking about those obligations. I‚Äôm talking about the ones we make with ourselves, with our God, with our own consciousness. I‚Äôm talking about the YOU versus YOU obligations. We have to have them. Again, these are not societal laws and expectations that we acknowledge and endow for anyone other than ourselves. These are FAITH based OBLIGATIONS that we make on our own.    Not the lowered insurance rate for a good driving record, you will not be fined or put in jail if you do not gratify the obligations I speak of‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno one else governs these but you.    They‚Äôre secrets with yourself, private council, personal protocols, and while nobody throws you a party when you abide by them, no one will arrest you when you break them either. Except yourself. Or, some cops who got a ‚Äúdisturbing the peace‚Äù call at 2:30 in the morning because you were playing bongos in your birthday suit.    An honest man‚Äôs pillow is his peace of mind, and when you lay down on the pillow at night, no matter who‚Äôs in our bed we ALL sleep alone.‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThese are your personal jiminy crickets. And there are not enough cops in the entire world to police them‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIt‚Äôs on YOU."
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,coaxfun,5,Mon May 18 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"9.From can to want    1995 I got my first big paycheck as an actor. I think it was 150 grand. The film was Boys on the Side and we‚Äôre shooting in Tucson, AZ and I have this sweet little adobe guest house on the edge of the Saguaro National Park. The house came with a maid. My first maid. It was awesome. So, I‚Äôve got a friend over one Friday night and we‚Äôre having a good time and I‚Äôm telling her about how happy I am with my set up . The house. The maid. Especially, the maid. I‚Äôm telling her, ‚Äúshe cleans the place after I go to work, washes my clothes, the dishes, puts fresh water by my bed, leaves me cooked meals sometimes, and SHE EVEN PRESSES MY JEANS!‚Äù My friend, she smiles at me, happy for my genuine excitement over this ‚Äúluxury service‚Äù I‚Äôm getting, and she says, ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶that‚Äôs great‚Ä¶if you like your jeans pressed.‚Äù    I kind of looked at her, kind of stuttered without saying anything, you know, that dumb ass look you can get, and it hit me‚Ä¶    I hate that line going down my jeans! And it was then, for the first time, that I noticed‚Ä¶I‚Äôve never thought about NOT liking that starched line down the front of my jeans!! Because I‚Äôd never had a maid to iron my jeans before!! And since she did, now, for the first time in my life, I just liked it because I could get it, I never thought about if I really wanted it there. Well, I did NOT want it there. That line‚Ä¶ and that night I learned something.    Just because you CAN?‚Ä¶ Nah‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not a good enough reason to do something. Even when it means having more, be discerning, choose it, because you WANT it, DO IT because you WANT to.    I‚Äôve never had my jeans pressed since.    10.A roof is a man made thing    January 3, 1993. NFL playoffs. Your Houston Oilers vs. Buffalo Bills. Oilers up 28‚Äì3 at halftime, 35‚Äì3 early in the 3rd. Frank Reich and the Bills come back to win 41‚Äì38 in overtime for one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history. Yeah, the Bills won, but they didn‚Äôt really beat the Oilers. The Oilers lost that game, they beat themselves.    Why? Because at halftime they put a ceiling, a roof, a limit on their belief in themselves, a.k.a the ‚Äúprevent defense.‚Äù Maybe they started thinking about the next opponent at halftime, played on their heels, lost the mental edge the entire 2nd half and voila, they lost. In a mere 2 quarters defensive coordinator Jim Eddy went from being called DC OF THE YEAR and ‚Äúthe man first in line to be a HC next year‚Äù to a man without a job in the NFL.    You ever choked? You know what I mean, fumbled at the goal line, stuck your foot in your mouth once you got the microphone, had a brain freeze on the exam you were totally prepared for, forgot the punch line to a joke in front of four thousand graduating students at a University of Houston Commencement speech? Or maybe you‚Äôve had that feeling of ‚ÄúOh my God, life can‚Äôt get any better, do I deserve this?‚Äù    What happens when we get that feeling? We tense up, we have this outer body experience where we are literally seeing our self in the third person. We realize that the moment just got bigger than us. You ever felt that way? I have.    It‚Äôs because we have created a fictitious ceiling, a roof, to our expectations of ourselves, a limit ‚Äî where we think it‚Äôs all too good to be true. BUT IT ISN‚ÄôT. AND IT‚ÄôS NOT OUR RIGHT TO SAY OR BELIEVE IT IS.    We shouldn‚Äôt create these restrictions on ourselves. A blue ribbon, a statue, a score, a great idea, the love of our life, a euphoric bliss. Who are we to think we don‚Äôt deserve or haven‚Äôt earned these gifts when we get them?    Not our right.    But if we stay in process, within ourselves, in the joy of the doing, we will never choke at the finish line. Why? Because we aren‚Äôt thinking of the finish line, we‚Äôre not looking at the clock, we‚Äôre not watching ourselves on the Jumbotron performing the very act we are in the middle of. No, we‚Äôre in process, the APPROACH IS THE DESTINATION‚Ä¶ and we are NEVER finished.    Bo Jackson ran over the goal line, through the end zone and up the tunnel ‚Äî the greatest snipers and marksmen in the world don‚Äôt aim at the target, they aim on the other side of it.    We do our best when our destinations are beyond the ‚Äúmeasurement,‚Äù when our reach continually exceeds our grasp, when we have immortal finish lines.    When we do this, the race is never over. The journey has no port. The adventure never ends because we are always on our way. Do this, and let them tap us on the shoulder and say, ‚Äúhey, you scored.‚Äù Let them tell you ‚ÄúYou won.‚Äù Let them come tell you, ‚Äúyou can go home now.‚Äù Let them say ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù Let them say ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù    TAKE THE LID OFF THE MAN MADE ROOFS WE PUT ABOVE OURSELVES AND ALWAYS PLAY LIKE AN UNDERDOG.    11.Turn the page    The late and great University of Texas football coach Daryl Royal was a friend of mine and a good friend to many. A lot of people looked up to him. One was a musician named ‚ÄúLarry.‚Äù Now at this time in his life Larry was in the prime of his country music career, had #1 hits and his life was rollin‚Äô. He had picked up a habit snortin‚Äô ‚Äúthe white stuff‚Äù somewhere along the line and at one particular party after a ‚Äúbathroom break,‚Äù Larry went confidently up to his mentor Daryl and he started telling Coach a story. Coach listened as he always had and when Larry finished his story and was about to walk away, Coach Royal put a gentle hand on his shoulder and very discreetly said, ‚ÄúLarry, you got something on your nose there bud.‚Äù Larry immediately hurried to the bathroom mirror where he saw some white powder he hadn‚Äôt cleaned off his nose. He was ashamed. He was embarrassed. As much because he felt so disrespectful to Coach Royal, and as much because he‚Äôd obviously gotten too comfortable with the drug to even hide as well as he should.    Well, the next day Larry went to coach‚Äôs house, rang the doorbell, Coach answered and he said, ‚ÄúCoach, I need to talk to you.‚Äù Daryl said, ‚Äúsure, c‚Äômon in.‚Äù    Larry confessed. He purged his sins to Coach. He told him how embarrassed he was, and how he‚Äôs ‚Äúlost his way‚Äù in the midst of all the fame and fortune and towards the end of an hour, Larry, in tears, asked Coach, ‚ÄúWhat do you think I should do?‚Äù Now, Coach, being a man of few words, just looked at him and calmly confessed himself. He said, ‚ÄúLarry, I have never had any trouble turning the page in the book of my life.‚Äù Larry got sober that day and he has been for the last 40 years.    You ever get in a rut? Stuck on the merry-go-round of a bad habit? I have. You are going to make mistakes ‚Äî own them, make amends, and move on. Guilt and regret kills many a man before their time. Turn the page, get off the ride. YOU are the author of the book of your life. Turn the page.    12.Give your obstacles credit    You know these No Fear t-shirts? I don‚Äôt get em. Hell, I try to scare myself at least once a day. I get butterflies every morning before I go to work. I was nervous before I got here to speak tonight. I think fear is a good thing. Why? Because it increases our NEED to overcome that fear.    Say your obstacle is fear of rejection. You want to ask her out but you fear she may say ‚Äúno.‚Äù You want to ask for that promotion but you‚Äôre scared your boss will think you‚Äôre overstepping your bounds.    Well, instead of denying these fears, declare them, say them out loud, admit them, give them the credit they deserve. Don‚Äôt get all macho and act like they‚Äôre no big deal, and don‚Äôt get paralyzed by denying they exist and therefore abandoning your need to overcome them. I mean, I‚Äôd subscribe to the belief that we‚Äôre all destined to have to do the thing we fear the most anyway.    So, you give your obstacles credit and you will one. Find the courage to overcome them or see clearly that they are not really worth prevailing over.    BE BRAVE, HAVE COURAGE. WHEN YOU DO YOU GET STRONGER, MORE AWARE, AND MORE RESPECTFUL ‚Äî OF YOURSELF, AND THAT WHICH YOU FEAR.    13.So how do we know when we cross the truth?    13.Why 13? Unlucky # right?    Well, when did 13 get the bad rap and become the mongrel of numerology? Thirteen‚Äôs never done me wrong. In fact, 13 has been a pretty lucky number for me, lemme tell you how:    I‚Äôve always taken these 21 day trips by myself to far off places where I usually don‚Äôt know the language and nobody knows my name. They‚Äôre adventures and they‚Äôre a purge, a cleanse for me. Like a 21 day fast from attention, from all the things I have in my well appointed life. They‚Äôre a check OUT, so I can check IN with myself.    See how I‚Äôm doing, be forced to be my own and only company, to have a look in MY mirror. And you know what can happen when we do THAT ‚Äî sometimes we don‚Äôt like what we see.    In 1996, right after I got ‚Äúfamous‚Äù from a film called A Time to Kill, I headed out on one of these 21-day walkabouts ‚Äî this time to the jungles and mountains of Peru. The sudden fame I‚Äôd just gotten was somewhat unbalancing. My face was everywhere, everyone wanted a piece of me, people I‚Äôd never met were swearing they ‚Äúloved me‚Äù ‚Äî everywhere I went, there I was, on a billboard, a magazine cover. It was just weird. What was this all about? What was reality and what was bullshit? Did I deserve all this?‚Äù were all questions I was asking myself.    ‚ÄúWho was I?‚Äù was another.    Now, there‚Äôs always an initiation period with these trips. An amount of time that it takes for the place to INITIATE the traveler. The time it takes to disconnect from the world we left, and become completely present in the one we are traveling in‚Ä¶For me, that initiation period usually last about thirteen days. Yes. Thirteen hellish days until I‚Äôm out of my own way. After that, the trip is smooth sailing."
UniversityOfHouston,364jtc,coaxfun,3,Mon May 18 01:37:21 2015 UTC,"Well, it was the night of the twelfth day of my 21-day trip. I was settling into camp, I‚Äôd already hiked 80 miles to this point and had a three-day trek to Machu Pichu ahead of me.    I was sick of myself. Wrestling with the loss of my anonymity, guilt ridden for sins of my past, full of regret. I was lonely‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädisgusted with the company I was keeping: MY OWN‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand doing a pretty good job of mentally beating the shit out of myself.    Grappling with the demons on this night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. All of these badges and banners and expectations and anxieties I was carrying with me. I needed to free myself from them‚Ä¶ Who was I? I asked myself. Not only on this trip but in this life. So I stripped down to nothing. I took off every moniker that gave me pride and confidence, all the window dressings, the packaging around my product (heart). I discarded my lucky and faithful American cap, stripped off my talismans from adventures past. I even discarded my late father‚Äôs gold ring he gave to me that was made from a meltdown of he and my mom‚Äôs class rings and gold from one of her teeth.    I was naked. Literally and figuratively. And I got sick. Soaked in sweat, I threw up until there was no bile left in my belly, and finally passed out from exhaustion.    A few hours later, I awoke on this thirteenth morning to a rising sun. Surprisingly fresh and energized, I dressed, made some tea and went for a morning walk. Not towards my destination Machu Pichu but rather to nowhere in particular. My gut was still a bit piqued from last night‚Äôs purge, yet I curiously felt pretty good: alive, clean, free, light.    Along a muddy path on this walk, I turned a corner and there in the middle of the road was a mirage of the most magnificent pinks and blues and red colors I had ever seen. It was electric, glowing and vibrant, hovering just off the surface, as if it was plugged in to some neon power plant.    I stopped. I stared. There was no way around it: The jungle floor in front of me was actually THOUSANDS OF BUTTERFLIES. There, in my path. It was SPECTACULAR.    I stayed awhile, and somewhere in my captivation, I heard this little voice inside my head say these words, ‚ÄúAll I want is what I can see, and what I can see, is in front of me.‚Äù    At that moment, for the first time on this trip, I had stopped anticipating what was around the corner, stopped thinking about what was coming up next and what was up ahead. Time slowed down. I was no longer in a rush to get anywhere. My anxieties were eased.    A few hours later I returned to camp and packed for my continued journey onto Machu Pichu. I had a bounce in my step, new energy. The local Sherpas I was traveling with even noticed, calling out to me, ‚Äúsois luz Mateo, sois luz!!!‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämeaning ‚Äúyou are light‚Äù in Spanish.    You see, I forgave myself that morning. I let go of the guilt, the weight on my shoulders lifted, my penance paid, and I got back in good graces with God. I shook hands with myself, my best friend, the one we‚Äôre all stuck with anyway. From that morning on, the adventure was awesome. I was present, out of my own way, not anticipating next, embracing only what was in front of my eyes, and giving everything the justice it deserved.    You see, I crossed a truth that morning. Did I find it? I don‚Äôt know, I think it found me. Why? Because I put myself in a place to be found. I put myself in a place to receive the truth.    So, how do we know when we cross the truth?    I believe the truth is all around us, all the time. The answer, you know, it‚Äôs always right there. But we don‚Äôt always see it, grasp it, hear it, access it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause we‚Äôre not in the right place to.    So what do we do?    First, we have to put ourselves in the place to receive the truth. We live in an extremely noisy world with all kinds of frequencies coming at us‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcommitments, deadlines, fix this, do that, plans, expectations‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand they all make it hard to get clarity and peace of mind. So we have to consciously put ourselves in a place to receive that clarity. Whether that‚Äôs prayer, meditation, a walkabout, being in right company, a road trip, whatever it is for you.    Schedule that time to be in a place to receive the truth.    Now, if we hear it, if it becomes clear, a truth that is natural and infinite, then the second part comes‚Ä¶    ‚Ä¶which is to PERSONALIZE it. Ask how it works for you, how it applies to you personally, why you need it in your life, specifically.    ‚Ä¶If we do THAT, then comes the third part:    ‚Ä¶.having the patience to internalize it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand get it from our intellectual head and into our bones and soul and our instinct. We can‚Äôt rush this part, it takes time.    And if we get that far. We received it, we personalized it, we internalized it. If we make it that far, then comes THE BIGGIE ‚Ä¶.    Having the courage to act on it. To actually take it into our daily lives and practice it, to make it an active part of who we are and live it.    If we can do that, then we have what I believe is Heaven on Earth.    The place where what we want is also just what we need. I mean that‚Äôs the ticket isn‚Äôt it!!? That‚Äôs where I want to live!!    So while we‚Äôre here, let‚Äôs make it a place where we break a sweat, where we believe, where we enjoy the process of succeeding in the places and ways we are fashioned to. Where we don‚Äôt have to look over our shoulder because we are too busy doing what we‚Äôre good at. Voluntarily keeping our own council because we WANT to. Traveling towards immortal finish lines. We write our book. Overcome our fears. We make friends with ourselves.    That is the place I‚Äôm talking about.    Thank you, good luck and just keep livin."

UniversityOfHouston,3630vx,Mentirosa,7,Fri May 15 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"My sister graduated from CLASS yesterday and I thought it was one of the worst graduations I have ever attended. There were too many graduates and they had to rush through the names, including masters and PhD graduates. The dean had a bad speech that he fumbled several times over. Not trying to sound overly critical,  but I graduated from CLASS a year ago and it was much better. At least we had a student speaker, I got to shake Renu Khator's hand, and we moved our tassels. There was nothing special about yesterday's ceremony other than the pride of the graduate walking across the stage."
UniversityOfHouston,3630vx,Werowocomoco,7,Fri May 15 23:19:18 2015 UTC,Way way too long. Should've split CLASS into two separate ceremonies.
UniversityOfHouston,3630vx,yakovgolyadkin,4,Fri May 15 22:26:14 2015 UTC,"CLASS was offered two, they declined and had one.... for whatever reason."
UniversityOfHouston,3630vx,coaxfun,0,Sat May 16 00:41:45 2015 UTC,whomever decided to do that.....chose poorly
UniversityOfHouston,3630vx,drfarren,9,Sat May 16 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"The dean (?)'s speech sounded like it was meant for a different group for a while. The tassle thing was weird, but it WAS 10pm. I think the university needs to actually follow through and make a college of Arts with music, art, and theater. Also put economy in business."

UniversityOfHouston,360his,Takeme2yourleader,4,Fri May 15 15:17:02 2015 UTC,I don't think the gym was ever free as it was part of the student fees and you had to be registered.
UniversityOfHouston,360his,coogie,2,Fri May 15 15:33:39 2015 UTC,Jesuschrist. I understand that. I'm talking about after you graduate how long can you go. My girlfriend has been going since December after she graduated. And hasn't paid again
UniversityOfHouston,360his,Takeme2yourleader,3,Fri May 15 15:38:00 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced that the gym scans your ID and says ""Yep, it's a UH ID"" and doesn't check to see if you're an active student. I've had several graduated friends come back and use it and never bat an eye going through the scanner."
UniversityOfHouston,360his,coolswampert,3,Fri May 15 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"I remember one time I was registered for a summer IV session and went there a week or so earlier while it was officially summer I (at least back in my day that's what they were called).  They scanned my ID and it got rejected because I wasn't technically registered during that semester.   I ended up getting a 24 hour fitness membership around then (which I still have) thinking ""oh well, it's free, I can't expect too much from them""...then I noticed that they started charging an extra $90 a semester for the gym whether I used it or not."
UniversityOfHouston,360his,coogie,1 point,Fri May 15 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, I wish there was more awareness of the $92 required fee.

""Email for Life"" provides a University of Houston email address for all graduating students. It never expires and never goes away.  When a student enrolls at UH they are provided with an Email alias. The alias is an address that doesn't have a mailbox but  forwards all messages to the students own personal email account. This has some great advantages for students in that they do not have to check multiple email accounts but still have the benefit of an address with their University.

UniversityOfHouston,35vvpu,Dub_Squigs,3,Thu May 14 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"I think that depends on a lot of factors such as job prospects, student debt, opportunity costs etc. If someone spent 9 years full time taking out student loans to get an undergrad degree, then I would probably say better never."
UniversityOfHouston,35vvpu,steadyflying,8,Thu May 14 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"While I agree that in that situation it's probably better to not do it at all, I don't think anyone would need 9 years to get a degree if they're going full time. They'd eventually get enough credits for a degree before that.  I took 9 years because I only went part time for most of it. I worked at the same time to pay for it and I did a dual degree program. So at this point - two bachelors, zero debt, and 6+ years of work experience - it's definitely better late than never."
UniversityOfHouston,35vvpu,Dub_Squigs,3,Thu May 14 17:57:33 2015 UTC,"If someone spends 9 years enrolled in any program full time, chances are they'll never graduate.

I moved from the Spring/The Woodlands area. As far as UH goes I was so surprised by the diversity when I got down here. Before, I'd never really seen so many different cultures together. It wasn't a slap in the face, but in Spring we only have white, black, Hispanic and some Asians. Anyways, it's awesome and I love it.   As far as housing goes it really depends where you live. At UH you really have to get used to walking across campus quite often to get to class or a testing center so be sure not to have a 1 ton backpack. Those will kill you on the first day.   Also, not sure about Tomball but I think the state of Tomball now is how Spring was 7 years ago or so. So if you're going to walk around campus don't walk around the outskirts late at night with your face buried in your phone. Anywhere in campus is perfectly fine.   Any specific questions?"
UniversityOfHouston,35vh60,Gh0stw0lf,1 point,Tue May 19 18:14:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. Is it as unsafe as it seems? I've driven around the outside of the campus and the parts around it seem kind of sketchy? Not that that would deter me but it's just something to consider.

I waited until the last minute as well and was a bit worried since my professor said that a majority of people who wait until the last minute fail the course.

I was never really subjected to it since I had a lot of AP credit as an undergrad but it is such a blight on the university. The TAs are treated like shit, CASA exam scheduling is stupid beyond belief and the lack of any real connections between CASA and the math department is unacceptable. The math department just unloads everything they don't want to deal with on CASA and doesn't give a shit about any collateral damage, be it students and test scheduling or the treatment of TAs. I'm completely against testing centers. In a previous university of mine, they had something like 800 students in the gym taking multiple different exams. I don't see why UH must use some testing center (they do have options.. there are many, many empty rooms around the university around finals time) and why there aren't any real safety nets in place. If a student can't make it to a CASA final, then there should be a written exam that they can take instead of telling a student ""well too bad, better luck next semester"". The math department was good to me at one time but I am really sick of all of its bullshit."

UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,SometimesY,1 point,Wed May 27 11:55:47 2015 UTC,Will definitely do that? Any advice for teachers/classes and such? Mind if I shoot you a message? Would love to ask some more specific questions if that's alright.
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,AlgeKevin,1 point,Wed May 27 15:58:48 2015 UTC,"Go ahead. Let me know what classes you're looking to take, what your background is and what you want out of your degree. I'll give you a pretty good idea of how you should proceed from classes to professors."
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,SometimesY,2,Wed May 27 16:00:44 2015 UTC,They should just double the size of CASA room. It's very secure from cheating. Other rooms on campus dont have security cameras.
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,fuglyflamingo,17,Tue May 12 18:58:54 2015 UTC,"There really isn't much the professor can do.  CASA has limited computers available for testing.  I've missed a CASA exam before due to an accident on I-45 and I ended up refreshing the CASA page until I saw an opening and snatched it up.  Believe me, we all know how crappy CASA is, but your professor is correct, you should keep looking for an open spot until you find one.  If that fails and you still can't get an open spot, personally I'd talk to every possible person until something happens: your professor, the head of the math department, etc.  Seems pretty dumb to fail a student simply because CASA is terrible."
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,fallsfoolacy,13,Tue May 12 01:56:50 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up for the future, if your previous past exams have been in CASA, your final will likely be in CASA. Always rely on the syllabus instead of the spring final schedule.   That being said, I had Emath with etgen last semester and I knew a few people this happened to because they didn't wait up until midnight to sign up for exams.   My advice, check 3 times an hour. It's the only way."
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,Gh0stw0lf,2,Tue May 12 04:39:35 2015 UTC,"When I was at UH, 10-20 spots opened up for the first few times in the morning for every exam I took. Keep checking espec the night before the exam when dummies drop the time hoping for a later time. And if all else fails, stay near CASA in case there's a no show. They might let you in"
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,fuglyflamingo,1 point,Tue May 12 18:56:02 2015 UTC,I am coming in a transfer student next semester. There is a mandatory testing facility on campus? we have to use it for all tests/finals?
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,ilovepb24666,1 point,Tue May 12 23:19:53 2015 UTC,"It's not mandatory. Only some classes use the testing center, mostly first year courses and even then it's only a fraction of the first year courses."
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,SometimesY,1 point,Tue May 12 23:22:12 2015 UTC,oh phew thought it was gonna be some ridiculous system.
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,ilovepb24666,3,Tue May 12 23:25:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly man, the people that complain are the people that aren't  organized. If you do get am exam that's in CASA stay up until midnight (when the test opens) and sign up for the time you want. Don't put it off."
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,Gh0stw0lf,1 point,Wed May 13 10:05:15 2015 UTC,"But it still doesn't make sense that CASA doesn't open up enough seats for the number of enrolled students in the course. If a class has 150 people, then CASA needs to have 150 slots; if they can't accommodate that, then it's a fucked up system that needs to either be upgraded or done away with. There's no excuse for someone in the class to be unable to take a test, especially a final - that's fucking ridiculous.  It's the equivalent of a professor holding a final for 150 students in a classroom with a fire code capacity of 125 people, and having to tell 17% of the class that they can't take the exam because there's a limited amount of space."
UniversityOfHouston,35nrls,Burt-Macklin,1 point,Sun May 17 02:26:48 2015 UTC,How'd it go?

UniversityOfHouston,358c3b,keekah,2,Sat May 9 05:43:02 2015 UTC,I took an online course during the summer last year.  It was a history course on the Vietnam War. The video lectures on youtube were from the late 1990s...

You can change the speed setting of the videos to make them go 1.25x, 1.5x or 2x faster, which helped a lot in getting through them all in a short amount of time. Plus you can watch the videos at anytime of the day, or watch one half of a video in the morning and the other half later."

UniversityOfHouston,355hou,stoleyourwaifu,14,Thu May 7 07:25:25 2015 UTC,"I transferred from cockrell to UH in fall'13. haven't regretted my decision.  key points:  1) no doubt UT engineering has waay more opportunities. UH engineering also has a great deal of opportunities but not close to UT for a variety of reasons (read funding, faculty etc). However, the student body is smaller and fewer students seem to be in pursuit of those said opportunities. Therefore, you're not really missing out on much. So yeah there are tonnes of opportunities, but UT has more.  2) UT engr career fair is larger than UH and is 2 days. UH engr fair is a day and its good. Again, the quality of students that UT attracts and boasts is the reason why employers are so keen to recruit from UT. However, a lot of those same companies recruit from UH too and UH produces a good number of quality of engineers. Again not the same number as UT for a variety of reasons but nothing to deter you from coming here.  3) Grading at UH is definitely harder but nothing a little discipline and hard work can't handle. I honestly support harder grading for engineering majors because it creates quality work ethic and discipline but unfortunately my fellow engr undergrads don't feel the same way. Again, nothing too bad.  4) UH is actually getting bigger and better in research and in a few years time (2016 onwards) we'll get a massive boost because of a number of new developments currently going on. We are building a new dedicated multidisciplinary research building and have dedicated group of buildings for other research purposes (ERP). So yeah, more opportunities.  In short, UH has almost the same opportunities as UT, just fewer. Again, smaller student body and large number of commuter students means you can actually get a lot of quality experience under your belt. Honestly, UH is a very good school. But for engineering students as long as your school is accredited and you have a good work ethic, ability to make connections and be an effective communicator, you have nothing to worry about (pls ignore run on).  sorry no tldr. You won't regret transferring to UH. Keep a positive attitude, look forward and always keep your goal in mind.   Let me know if you have any further questions  Cheers"

UniversityOfHouston,355hou,yolonazi,1 point,Thu May 7 16:16:35 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I was asking - how does grading become harder at UH? Sorry for the confusion
UniversityOfHouston,355hou,caedin8,3,Thu May 7 18:01:44 2015 UTC,"well, come to think of it, grading isn't exactly the problem. What happens in some cases is that the exams are unrealistically harder than what a) students expect and b) what should be expected of students at that level. Having said that, this applies pretty much exclusively in weed out STEM classes. Chem Es have chem process and thermo IIRC that have historically had low passing rates. So when the exams are hard/long af, people get bad grades. Hence the perception, I think. In some cases professors don't give partial credit which pisses a lot of people off. Basically its all a matter of elevating the expectations from students. But you're past upper division so you should be fine really."
UniversityOfHouston,355hou,caedin8,2,Thu May 7 19:17:10 2015 UTC,"You won't slide by at UH into a great job. You can do that at UT. At UH you will need to be proactive in finding  taking advantage of internship opportunities. That being said many UH students are lazy, so you can easily be a big fish in a small pond and get the jobs. That is what I did and it worked out great for me. I found part time work as a research assistant, which gave me the skills for a $31/hr summer internship which gave me the experience for a great first job offer.   Remember your GPA basically resets on transfer so use it as a shot for that 4.0. Mine was 3.1 at aTm and I am graduating now with a 3.8 from UH."

UniversityOfHouston,355hou,keekah,7,Fri May 8 00:48:17 2015 UTC,"UH MECE here (who had a brother that went to engineering at UT).  From what I've had experience with, the internships are plentiful, you'll get hired right out of school, and an engineering degree is exactly that, an engineering degree from a school known for engineering.   Heck, we even have start-ups completing prototypes that will get them 15 million dollar grants for the construction of a manufacturing plant. I have these guys in my classes, and they're just a part of the group. As far as creative types go, I make my own knives from slabs of steel, and we have the gym rats and motor sports guys here too. We're a diverse bunch not only in race (which UH is hailed for), but everything under the sun.   The classes are hard, and will test you, but it seems like the professors are very realistic in their final grades. I've deserved every single one I've gotten and I've got a bit better sometimes too.   Now for the accents. They may be there and sometimes a little thick, but not only does this prepare you for the world-wide companies we will be a part of (had interviews with the largest valve company in China) but it also keeps you awake when you're in classes. We have a lot of fun with this. There have been stories of these companies doing telephone conferences and the only ones who could understand what the foreigners were saying we're the UH interns, whose notes were used as the company's official minutes from the meeting.  The faculty, once you get into upper level classes really want you to learn the stuff and will help when they can. Also, our senior design classes are either very flexible with the departments. Sometimes the local companies will task us with projects that they need done and Give us a budget. I'm making a race car with about 30 other mechanical engineers, to compete nationally in a competition that UH has started that went global.   UH does have smart, creative people as well, but there are a few downsides, which I will try to be honest with. To start, no 6th street and very little college town atmosphere ( trust me, that's what Austin in, especially around campus) meaning very few close restaurants and even fewer that stay open later. Also, you'll probably need a car to get anywhere for groceries, as the surroundings aren't that great, but campus is relatively safe.   As for the cost, we'll save you a decent chunk of money."

UniversityOfHouston,355hou,Sup6969,1 point,Thu May 7 15:08:42 2015 UTC,Isn't BIOeng the easiest one? Maybe industrial?
UniversityOfHouston,355hou,Sup6969,2,Thu May 7 15:46:19 2015 UTC,"Industrial is generally held to be the easiest - they don't even have to take thermo until they're a senior, iirc. ENGI thermo at that. BIOE gets relatively easy later on but starting out you have to take all the big weed-out classes (circuits, chem pro, mechanics, etc)"
UniversityOfHouston,355hou,ILIKETHECOLORRED,2,Fri May 8 03:35:04 2015 UTC,"The main changes from someone who's seen UT ChemE as well:   Our ChemE is smaller. Not really a good or bad thing, it's just career fairs, classes etc are smaller, but at the same time there are less total students, meaning you face less competition and more personal attention. Ours is tougher. Our dropout rate is much higher, generally 80-90%. Part of this is just lower admissions requirements, but part of it is also higher difficulty. Classes for first few semesters are are curved in a way that only about half actually make it through each successive semester. More local internship/co-op and research opportunities. Getting undergrad research experience is very tough at UT since so many students are are trying to get it, UH is quite a bit less competitive. Houston is a bigger city with a far bigger engineering job market.   I will say if you're interested in having a life, you really have to make an effort to get involved, because a lot of people you'll encounter in class are... not."

But you can normally get the same help for free from another serivce or an on campus organisation.  Personally I would not do it. If you are not getting any interviews at the career fair you need to beef up your resume. Join more leadership roles in organizations and raise your gpa.
UniversityOfHouston,3540at,yolonazi,17,Wed May 6 22:32:48 2015 UTC,Much better than the satellite campuses.
UniversityOfHouston,3540at,SometimesY,21,Wed May 6 22:55:09 2015 UTC,"I would go so far as to say that UH has more in common with UT and aTm than with any of their satellite schools. UH is the flagship campus of the UH system which includes its own satellite campuses in Clear Lake, Victoria and a campus it oversees in Downtown Houston.   In enrollment terms, UH had 41,000 students enrolled in 2013 while the most enrolled by the UT and aTm satellites are 41,000 at UT Arlington (2015), UT Dallas at 21,000 and 12,000 at aTm Commerce (2014). As for students living on campus, I read somewhere that UH has passed aTm and Tech.  With an endowment of $716 million, it has a lot more money to work with than the most cash-rich UT/aTm satellites of UT Dallas at $379 Million, UTEP at $183 Million and aTm Praire View (that is the largest endowment I could find) at $47 Million.  In academics, only UT, aTm and UT Dallas satellite campus ranks higher than UH (according to US New & World Report). UT Dallas is an INCREDIBLE research institution so I will happily give them that.  Let's not forget about the strength of the sports program of UH. That alone brings in millions of dollars in revenue that most of the satellite campuses, with a few exclusions in UTSA and UTEP, cannot replicate.  UH is working very hard to become recognized as the 3rd large university in the state. It has already received money from the State of Texas that reflects that and UH is trying to increase its share to compete with the other two recipients, UT & aTm.  edit: I forgot how to Wikipedia for a second. UT has a much stronger satellite system than aTm, apparently."
UniversityOfHouston,3540at,Pathis,6,Wed May 6 23:55:16 2015 UTC,Excellent write up!
UniversityOfHouston,3540at,SometimesY,8,Thu May 7 00:02:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was looking into how much better, exactly, UH was and was kind of surprised with some of the results.  UT Arlington has a HUGE student population but its academics are a joke and it is even a bigger commuter school than UH.  I was actually not surprised by how large the UT Dallas endowment was but when you consider how much there is go to around per-student, it is pretty impressive. UH has $17,463/student where UT Dallas has $18,947/student.  aTm needs to step up its game!"
UniversityOfHouston,3540at,Pathis,3,Thu May 7 00:24:50 2015 UTC,"aTm cares a lot less about their satellite program. In fact they are proud that only main campus students, Qatar students, and Galveston students can get Aggie rings. None of the other satellites are eligible."

UniversityOfHouston,3540at,nishcheta,0,Thu May 7 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"Revenue, not profit. That revenue goes toward marketing the University, scholarships and alumni outreach. Yes, it operates at a net loss but that doesn't really matter."
UniversityOfHouston,3540at,Pathis,4,Thu May 7 15:34:13 2015 UTC,"You must be a Bauer student.    You brought up revenue as a means of demonstrating that the athletic program is a strength.  If it costs the university $10M per year (which it does, last reckoning), and doesn't generate at least that much in exposure (hint:  it doesn't; we could buy several super bowl spots for the same amount and get much more exposure).    The reality is that we don't pay $10M per year - we pay $26M per year to the athletic department.    Your say ""the revenue goes to marketing the university, scholarships and alumni outreach"" - this couldn't possibly be more false.  While yes, the athletic department does market, that marketing is done to athletes - when UH is marketed, this is done for free as part of the tv rights deal.  It doesn't cost anything.    I strongly urge you to read up on how athletic departments actually function.  The idea that ""it doesn't really matter"" that they take money from the university is pretty silly.  You can argue that the value it generates exceeds the $26M spent, but you cannot argue that $26M is somehow rendered worthless."

My favorite living situation was when I lived in Museum District. Right on the other side of 288 from campus. It was pricey, but it's way safer than staying on the campus side of 288, and I could take Macgregor to school, so I left about 20-30min before my classes started and never sat in traffic. Also significantly closer to grocery stores and restaurants in Montrose where you didn't fear getting mugged on your walk inside. If you don't drive, it's also close enough to bike to campus.

UniversityOfHouston,34g990,yolonazi,11,Fri May 1 05:20:11 2015 UTC,"so what exactly do you mean by 'another school'? Is it a specific school? Is it UT/A&M? Other public schools outside texas? what is your frame of reference?  secondly, you say the issue at hand is that there are fewer opportunities, correct? I think that can only be an issue if you exhaust the list of available opportunities and still fail to get any experience. I highly doubt that's the case.   honestly you'll be surprised how many opportunities are at UH that are under our very noses but we fail to see. So many research positions, so many networking opportunities, amazing professionals teaching/managing departments/courses. you have to respect those people and learn from them. I don't know your credentials but no matter how good you are opportunities will seldom just walk up to you and ask if you're interested.   i can't even begin to count the number of success stories at UH regarding people much more disadvantaged than you aka international students. not because of anything cultural, but because no one hires international due to visa issues/hurdles. yet i know a good number of international students who took any opportunity they saw, expanded their skill set and get positions with good companies.  honestly don't underestimate your school mates. there are plenty of smart and dedicated people here. maybe not as many/as rich as in other schools but pretty pretty respectable. i will not accept the excuse of 'fewer opportunities' unless someone takes advantage of every thing that they can and still get nothing out of them.  as far as the available opportunities go, there are quite a lot and the number keeps growing. and trust me it will grow more in the future. what you should be doing instead of complaining about stuff like this is actually reach out to people outside school, make connections and you never know what might come up.  granted not as many employers show up to our school as UT/A&M (and I don't even think thats a fair comparison yet ppl still bring it up all the time). but that is also a reflection of the type of students we have. if you're good, you'll be hired regardless. good is vague, but you have to have the general skill set required to be competitive, coachable, easy to get along and hard working.   As an engineering major I know all about the dearth of companies coming to our doorstep. but the only way to change that is the improve ourselves, make connections and give back to our school."

UniversityOfHouston,34g990,_420CakeDay,4,Fri May 1 05:50:23 2015 UTC,"Wtf are you talking about, I'm graduating from UH with a STEM degree and had three full time offers in my senior year all at 70k. I could have had more but I picked one and stopped looking in October of 2014. Opportunity is there at UH for the students that want it. It is the same at A&M and UT. I know many UT grads making 35k out if school because they were unmotivated during school. Don't blame your misfortune on the university."
UniversityOfHouston,34g990,caedin8,4,Fri May 1 21:29:46 2015 UTC,"He was literally saying that UH is like ITT tech and no companies even consider our tech graduates with any worth. That is an opinion that is just wrong. The thing about success is that success isn't something you are given, it is earned.   Looking at statistical information about UH STEM graduates tells you more about the kind of people who go to UH and not much about the education and breadth of opportunities offered to UH students. UH accepts and graduates a lot of poor students who are unmotivated and fail to find opportunities, considerably more of these students get accepted at UH than at other top tier universities. This doesn't make the school and the opportunities worse, it just skews the statistics.   I know in my field of computer science companies are hiring as many good developers as they can find, even now with cheap oil. They offer their employees 5k bonuses for every referral who signs on with the company. Many UH CS students are getting interviews right now while the field is hot. Most of them fail their technical interviews. It isn't the universities fault this happens. Most of the CS students care more about league of legends and twitch than developing their skills. (Go walk around the 5th floor of PGH).   So the opportunities are there, but UH accepts mediocre students and thus our statistical employment rate in STEM is lower than other schools. UH is a great school to further your career if you are motivated to do so, it has been very rewarding for me and many others I know. I had full time offers from two fortune 100 companies, and interviewed with some of the big tech giants out on the west coast during my stay at UH. The problem isn't the school."

Anecdotal evidence again but I personally know a Chem E graduate from UT who is jobless. Same story; unmotivated during college, go to class, study, go to sleep and poor guy is still on the hunt. he graduated December.   Students at UH think companies don't respect us and all; that is false. Like you said, UH isn't talent dense. its a school where anyone can go and get a STEM degree and personally that is awesome. I really think STEM education should be more accessible and cheap. So if you want to stand out to employers, you just have to work hard, make connections, take advantage of opportunities and you'll be set."

UniversityOfHouston,34ava9,TweetPoster,2,Wed Apr 29 18:06:09 2015 UTC,Here is a relevant article from the 4/30 Chronicle.  Hopefully the link works; it went out in today's UH News Digest.
UniversityOfHouston,34ava9,tPTBNL,2,Thu Apr 30 21:07:08 2015 UTC,"So, what is the PUF and what would this mean for the university?"
UniversityOfHouston,34ava9,dk00111,11,Thu Apr 30 03:04:19 2015 UTC,"When Texas was admitted to the Union, its articles of annexation specified that Texas retained its public lands.  (Typically when unorganized territory joined the Union, public lands reverted to the Federal Government which is why the Federal Government today owns like 70% of the land West of the Mississippi).    After the Civil War, the legislature wisely took the public lands and split them into two pools.  Two thirds went to the ""Permanent School Fund"" - a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to reduce interest rates on bonds issued by school districts in Texas.  One third went to the Permanent University Fund - a separate Sovereign Wealth Fund that paid roughly 5% of its annual revenues to the two public universities in the state at the time - Texas A&M in College Station and UT Austin.    In the beginning this wasn't a whole lot of money.  Most of the revenue came from grazing fees (ranchers paid the state to be able to graze their cattle on the land).  In the 1900's, though, oil was discovered in West Texas (where most of the PSF and PUF land is), and so the state began to receive large mineral royalties from the PUF and PSF.    The PSF is only relevant to primary and secondary public school districts (like HISD).  So we'll leave that one aside for now.    In the early 20th century (and later), more universities were added to the state Public Higher Education system.  Texas Tech, then UH, then others (Angelo State, etc).  For many reasons, probably the most important of which was that Texas had segregated higher education (there were black universities and white universities - guess which UT and A&M were) as new schools were added, they were not added to the PUF.    Flash forward to today - the assets in the PUF are worth $14.9 B.  Each year, it pays around $250M to UT Austin and around $150M to A&M-College Station.  This effectively doubles the amount of public money from the state UT and A&M receive.  The state pays twice as much for a student going to UT Austin as it does for a student to go to UH, for example.    The problem is that there's no rational basis for this.  Clearly UT and A&M are superior schools to UH in terms of program quality...but it's very hard to argue that that quality difference isn't a direct result of the massively different levels of funding each school receives.  And on top of that, UH and the other non-PUF schools are overwhelmingly non-white...while UT and A&M remain overwhelmingly white.    If UH were to get access to the PUF it could mean an increase in our state funding by as much as $150M per year.  This would be a massive increase in funding, which our Administration would surely find a way to mostly squander as UT and A&M do their PUF money...but at least each school would get funded equally.    Side Note:  In the late 90's the state created the HEAF or Higher Education Assistance Fund.  If you're wondering if what I'm arguing is just a bunch of whiny 'not in the cool kids group' bullshit this is the proof that it's not.  HEAF was created to try and level out the funding inequities between public universities (ie raise UH, Texas Tech, et al to the same level as Austin and College Station).    The plan was to divert general revenues (ie tax dollars) into a fund, and then have that fund payout to the 'tier 2' universities at some later date.  The plan was pretty vague, but it was a plan.  When the Republicans swept into major power in 2002, they dismantled the plan and terminated the funding for HEAF when it reached around $400M (which sounds like a lot of money, but is about 1/20th as much as the PUF has - and it was to be spread among far more students).  All the ""Tier 1"" nonsense you hear about came about because in the late 2000's the legislature decided to make the HEAF money 'pay for performance' - ie, when a school reached some arbitrary criteria (to be established by the Higher Education Coordinating Board) and only then, it would be eligible for HEAF money.  Remember circa 2012 when suddenly and miraculously UH was Tier 1?  That was Dr. Khator playing politics to try and get us the HEAF money.    The problem with HEAF is that the legislature was never going to contribute enough money to make it like the PUF - to make it like the PUF the state of Texas would have to contribute BILLIONS per year - the total higher education budget is in the low single billions, so you can imagine how unlikely that would be in a state that hates the ""T"" word.    It's never going to happen, because every man, woman and child in the legislature is either an alum of UT Austin or College Station - or they have kids who currently go there.  And they'd be stupid not to, UT Austin and A&M are premiere institutions, and they got that way because of huge government spending.  It shouldn't be about reducing A&M and UT or taking from what they are given, it should be about giving UH students the same that UT and A&M students get.  Not because we are 'as good as' or whatever - but because they government doesn't get to pick winners and losers, especially not among students.    It's also worth noting that UT Austin and A&M College Station violently fight to maintain their control of the PUF.  They genuinely believe that they and they alone are entitled to double the average share of state money for their education.  It's not entirely clear why (most arguments have to do with ""that's the way it's always been, who cares of it started because of racism - we're not racists now just ignore the fact that all the minorities go to schools other than UT Austin and A&M)."
UniversityOfHouston,34ava9,nishcheta,5,Thu Apr 30 23:13:25 2015 UTC,"Wow man thanks a lot for the taking out the time to write this. This is an eye opener and explains a lot of things. I sincerely believe Khators administration is gonna make headway. If im not wrong, it seems she has been aggressively rallying to get that fund given how she met former UT VC Bill Powers, i might be wrong though.

I remember a day when the printer in the Honors College started randomly spitting out pornography.  Nobody was on any of their computers, and there were only 3 of us in the lounge (this was in 2002, back before the library expansion, so the Honors College was small and in the basement).  I remember having my first experiences with glamour shots in the lab in Oberholtzer because I'd been sexiled from my dorm (and again, it was 2002--the only year when I got sexiled*).  Of course, it never got past implied nudity there.  But I guess you're right.    * When I moved to Taub, Taub 309 became the Champagne Room.  Because there was no sex in the Champagne Room.  There was champagne in the Champagne Room (okay, it was Miller High Life, but you get the idea), but you know the rest of the monologue.  If either my roommate or I wanted to get down with the girl of the moment (or the guy in a couple of cases), we'd do it elsewhere."

UniversityOfHouston,349y88,ArtimusX,3,Wed Apr 29 17:59:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I think it makes sense. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but the problem was not really so much the fact that you couldn't park in the stadium garage, but that a garage parking thing did not allow you to park anywhere else.  Now, if I had pay hundreds of $$$ to park in a garage and then I couldn't even park on the other parking lots without being ticketed, I would be upset too.  I always thought that if you're gonna kick them out of the garages, you should allow them to use their garage permit as student commuter or maybe even just an economy pass."
UniversityOfHouston,349y88,Guavaberry27,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:47:37 2015 UTC,"From what I understand from previously parking in the stadium garage and going to several football games, you are allowed to park in the lots by the east garage to park for the game and not get ticketed.  IIRC this was explicitly stated on the UH website.  It's a bit of a walk across campus but it's not like you're breaking any rules or anything.  I have done this several times without getting ticketed.  This was before the new stadium was built but I doubt this policy has changed."
UniversityOfHouston,349y88,fallsfoolacy,2,Sat May 2 07:57:43 2015 UTC,Thats really nothing to complain about. Its gameday; every single school in the country with a football program has parking disruptions.

UniversityOfHouston,34awad,dsnchntd,5,Wed Apr 29 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"Just a warning: often in busy times in the semester NSM advising will fill up really fast. If the walk in hours start at 1, they'll begin collecting names at 12~ and there will already be a lot of people there. So, go there as early as you can and ask when their sign ups for the day are."
UniversityOfHouston,34awad,Guavaberry27,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:50:11 2015 UTC,"You should have a degree plan from your initial meeting with your advisor.

Procrastinated to register for Spring until I was done with finals and found out my account was blocked due to not seeing an advisor, but they had just left for the winter break...So I waited it out until they came back. Yeah all of the classes I originally had planned were gone, but there were still class availablity for other ones that were already on my degree plan. Once I saw the advisor she just talked about why I needed to see her even though I already had a degree plan and that I could now register. Good luck! edit: Mispelling correction."

If worst comes to worst, you'll end up on probation, which is more of a warning than anything else. Consult your advisor to see what to do if the worst happens. They've probably seen dozens of similar cases, although with the sorry state of UH advising right now, depending on department they may be of very limited help.   On the personal help side definitely see CAPS, http://www.uh.edu/caps/, who are quite helpful in dealing with situations like this.  There are also a lot of instances where it helps to take some time off, work and/or go to community college. Students will often get the space they need to reset their bearings and get their motivation back.  Best of luck, I've been through academically and psychologically rough periods before myself, I know how it can be. I love to be of whatever help I can for these kinds of situations."

I decided to do the next semester at HCC just to make sure I was ready for college but that was my decision, I could have stayed at UH if I preferred.

Things like kids sitting in the front row with a 17"" laptop playing league of legends, which you can't quite completely ignore when it's in the corner of your eye if you're looking at the whiteboard. Or blatantly texting, then asking the professor to go over something they just went over, taking away time that should be spent going over new material."

UniversityOfHouston,33skhe,UnoKitty,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:41:22 2015 UTC,"as a student at NSM, I saw cheating ALL the time. And it's often done in by several ways: people would sit strategically in groups and cheat during the tests, someone would know someone who had several versions of the old tests, or people would search for old tests on google and get lucky and find them. And if you think the cheating was done by the worse students you are wrong. Its most often those officers at the premed, pre opt, pre whatever you name it, they cheat on EVERY test. This in my opinion one of the reasons why I hated UH, no matter how much you study, there is no way you are doing as well or better than the cheaters. Try to get away with any of this, even looking at old HW assignments at Rice and I guarantee you are out of there, because they have a code of honor. Look up the Rice  Honor code and council, none of the students who cheat at UH would stand a chance of staying enrolled at Rice. I knew someone that got kicked out from Rice bc they cheated on a homework assignment! A 5% grade of one course, cost them a chance to graduate from one of the best http://honor.rice.edu/case-abstracts/ in the nation. And this is not just me shitting on UH, it's the truth. But the blame is not just with unscrupulous students, its also on the lazy professors who use and re use the same old versions of their tests.  Even by not changing a couple of questions on a 20 question test, that's ten points right there that guarantee an unfair advantage.   https://futureowls.rice.edu/futureowls/Honor_Code.asp http://honor.rice.edu/case-abstracts/  /endrant"

UniversityOfHouston,33ns30,jswilson64,0,Fri Apr 24 12:33:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest, learning a language on your own is an endeavor that requires a lot of self-discipline, inversely proportional to the amount of time you allot to learn a given amount of a language. If I were to bet on whether a randomly selected person were to effectively learn enough of a language, in a relatively short amount of time, to forgo taking the first two semesters of a language course sequence, I'd bet that they wouldn't be able to do it. But you didn't ask for an opinion on that, which is fair. You very well may have the discipline and/or disposition required for such a task: only reality will tell, right?  For western languages that generally use the same character system (German being a great example of this), a lot of the approaches are very much the same. What I will explain is how I view language learning, and provide some advice that is rather common among language learning groups that you should perceive as just a potential method that could work, but not science.  Essentially, you need to take on a few things simultaneously. One is grammar study: read and learn the rules of grammar of the target language in a way that is more common to reading the mechanics of any sort of subject, such as MLA formatting. So this would be using any of the resources for a language that are out there that discretely go over each component of a language's grammar. From here, you learn what sort of tenses exist in the languages, whether there is a gender system, how negation works, how plurality works; just general forms that the language takes on in any given context. I think this idea is relatively self-explanatory.  Another thing is straight vocabulary memorization. This is where many people may drop off because the consistency that is required. There are many methods, the one that I found most interesting was the Gold List method. Essentially, most methods you'll find that focus straight on memorization are a function of repetition over time (this stems from the ""forgetting curve"" that Ebbinghaus is historically known for in psychology). Now memorizing vocabulary isn't of any really significant utility alone without actually using the vocabulary, as I will mention in a moment. But what this will do is set the stage for quickly transitioning into a sort of intermediate ""fluency"". It's all about maximizing recall and recognition.  While studying grammar gives you a framework to utilize the vocabulary that you begin to absorb, language is observed to work similarly to skills that subvert the explicit consciousness. In other words, using language isn't an intentional skill that requires ""Okay, is this the correct verb conjugation for this tense I want? Am I pronouncing the vowel correctly with the proper shape?"", but rather more fluid like playing a musical instrument.  With this thought in mind, integration of this knowledge is key, therefore the third aspect is some sort of exposure exercises. This can be from consuming any sort of media related to the target language (e.g.; news, music, film) to resources designed explicitly for this integration (e.g.; phrase books, Pimsleur's audio tapes).   Some would argue that exposure to the language is a separate approach and can work almost exclusively: consider how people learn a language natively. Children learn purely from exposure. While it is shown that there is an observed difference in age when it comes to learning purely from exposure, the claim is still valid as many people that travel to new regions that use a different language from their own often learn that different language through exposure and not any real formal study.  But, one of the restrictions we are framing this problem of language learning with is that we have a more limited amount of time to work in, as well as relatively limited resources for exposure training (we don't live in Germany, for example). So to accelerate learning the patterns of grammar, vocabulary from actual experience of the language (through exposure training), we first establish these patterns through explicit study and memorization, then confirm the patterns through experiencing the language. This is a basic pattern to all of language learning.  One thing I have not touched on is phonetics: I have no advice there, as for me I have always picked up the pronunciation very quickly by spending a little time focusing on the basic vowel rules, then just reading and listening to media.  So to conclude, this is a basic approach that most methods you come across online will use in some form. Things like Rosetta are just too time consuming, and too basic. It's a waste of time and money.   If you'd like, I'd be willing to meet in-person to talk more about this. I am a very busy these days, but studying languages casually use to be a big hobby of mine to pass the time. I've always loved the topic."
UniversityOfHouston,33ns30,FuzzyHasek,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:26:03 2015 UTC,Yep the hardest part is definitely immersion. But I've studied a lot of latin grammar and a bit of old Norse/Icelandic. I'm not trying to completely learn the language on my own though. The reason I want to study to test into intermediate is because I do not want to pay for someone to tell me the verb conjugations and basic vocabulary.

(I don't know if they're keeping it the same for the upcoming schoolyear) If you enroll in CHEM 1331 or 1372, whether you're a freshman or upperclassman, you're required to take a Proficiency Assessment (PA) either right before classes start or during the first week. It is a 10-question, multiple choice, computerized test on basic algebra and high-school-level chemistry. If you fail (score 4 or less), you are more or less forced to drop the course, and recommended to take CHEM 1301 before enrolling in 1331 or 1372 in the future."

Once I left Houston back in 2000 (returned 11-13, Graduated from UH), I noticed that compared to many other major cities, the sports writers used a lot of weasely writing to make far-fetched hunches a) plausible and b) have enough of a sound rationalization to get on the front page and drive up readership. Betteridge's Law of Headlines gets a good workout here in Houston.  I'll never forget - during Jordan's 6th championship season with Chicago, either Fran Blinebury or Eddie Sefko wrote an article that said that it wasn't far-fetched to see Jordan come to Houston. Written with a headline above that was eye-catching, it was a precursor to click-bait that of course is timeless and nothing new.  I had a point to all of this - UH has its benefits for a 5-star recruit: Immediate playing time coupled with a burgeoning QB and team, likely immediate center-stage star power, offense built around you. It's possible. Is it likely? I think so. But 20+ years of being a Houston sports consumer has me jaded. I'll believe it when I see it."

UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,calidoc,3,Tue Apr 14 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"Right, I forgot, we aren't supposed to ever identify or acknowledge any problems we may have, and are instead supposed to just blindly insult anyone who dares voice any criticism.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: if we want a strong, loyal fanbase, we need success for an extended amount of time. We need something like several 10+ win seasons with perfect home records. If we get our asses kicked in the first home game of the year, which, critically, is the first game than any of the freshmen will watch, most of those potential fans get turned off really quick."
UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,yakovgolyadkin,2,Tue Apr 14 01:55:43 2015 UTC,"You're asking for our team to be one of the best in the country FOR SEVERAL YEARS ago in order for you to care? What the fuck is that? What will you do when they have three 10 win seasons, and one 7 win season? You won't care now, right?  How about you care about the school, and not just when we do good."
UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,srassen7,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"Oh for fucks sake. Every time this topic comes up, some idiot keeps moaning on about me not caring about the school because I am willing to point out what's wrong. I'm sorry I don't just sit around and complain about other fans. I guess I'm not good enough for that lazy route that you've chosen.  You really aren't getting this, are you? Here, I'll try to dumb it down so you can understand.   I am not asking for this for me to care. I do care. I've almost certainly cared for longer than you have. I've been to almost every home game, almost a dozen away games, and every single bowl game for nearly a decade. 90% of my wardrobe is red UH t-shirts from the games. Hell, I was the C in Cougars at the Conference Championship game in 2006. So stop accusing me of not caring. It's getting old fast. I'm explaining why so many people don't care. To have a large and strong fanbase, it takes more than being a mediocre team in a mediocre conference that just as often as not loses to even worse teams. Freshmen are the key to developing the fanbase. We need to get them interested in their first semester. As they go through their time at the university, they will hold that passion for the team, and help spread it. Several years of that in a row, and our school will develop a culture that actually cares passionately about the team. When freshmen see a loss like we had to Texas State in 2012 or UTSA in 2014, that's the first game they have ever seen of our team, and that colors their opinion of the team from then on. A lot of them won't come back after seeing that. To create fans out of more than just a small number of the student body, we need to have a team that they want to see. And most people want to see wins. Nobody has fun sitting there watching their team lose, and for the freshmen they don't have an inherent attachment to the team, so they are more than happy to just walk out two quarters into the season and never come back. It doesn't bother them at all.   So in order to develop a large, solid, passionate fanbase, we need to be a great team for an extended period of time.  We can acknowledge this, or we can choose to ignore it and go your route and just say that it's the fault of other fans who aren't as good of a fan as you are. We can just sit here in a circlejerk about how things would suddenly all be better if everyone else was more like us real fans."
UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,calidoc,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:39:33 2015 UTC,"I think you're unduly harsh overall, but make one truly excellent point about freshmen being vital to student support. When I first started going here (i left for a few years in between) we won a conference title and 10+ games. Football was the cool thing to do and tons of people went, got loud and stayed late. This year as a (now older) student I see how current freshmen/underclassmen mostly could give 2 craps and leave early if they even show up. And I don't entirely blame them given the team was off campus/mediocre. Still, I think Coach Hermann deserves some faith and buy-in"
UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,yakovgolyadkin,1 point,Tue Apr 14 06:14:44 2015 UTC,"You can sit there and say ""I'm saying this for everyone else"" all you want. The simple statement that we need to be top in the country for multiple seasons for people to care is absolutely asinine. So, while sure, maybe you're just playing devils advocate, but I doesn't make the statement any less idiotic.  People should cheer because their school is winning. They should cheer because it's our fucking school, and we should support it."

""People should cheer because it's our school"" isn't a new thing. And repeating it hasn't made a damn bit of difference nor will it. It's just a lazy way of making yourself feel like you're better than the other students because you actually care. We need major things to happen to actually change the entire culture at UH, and just constantly repeating ""people should care because they should"" sure as hell isn't helping."

UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,UHRossy,10,Tue Apr 14 09:30:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think anyone cares. If you are reading this and go ""Oh but I care!"" well good for you. But not to rain on your parade but you are in the minority.   UH is an almost exclusively commuter school. No one who gets into UH goes there because they are an alumnus family or want to be a part of the great football tradition. They go to learn and get a degree.   Personally I think this is a good thing and it sets UH apart from other big Texas schools (see A&M and UT). Football is practically it's own religion in Texas and as a result a perverse amount of funding is sent into the athletics programs statewide. If people lived on campus and went to UH for ""the college experience"" then maybe this would be a different discussion. But the fact of the matter is, if you fight houston traffic 3-5 days a week to go to school. You don't want to do it again to go to a football game for a team you don't care about."
UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,Pathis,12,Mon Apr 13 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"There is so much wrong with this.    The lowest attendance at a game last year was 21,471. If we assumed 1/2 of that was students (which would be my guess), then about 1/3 of all undergraduates were in attendance. I singled out undergraduates because most graduate students don't care about sports wherever they go, much less UH. If that's true, then by your definition of a minority white people are a minority in Houston. That statement would remain true even if we brought the # of students attending down to 1/3 of total attendance. Not even close. In 2007 15% of UH students lived on campus. Before CV1&2, Cougar Place (which existed before but was much smaller, and has since been upgraded) and Calhoun Lofts. Just because UH is in the heart of one of the largest cities in the US doesn't mean you can't get the University experience. If you were actually concerned with the finances of University, you would understand that this is completely inaccurate. No tuition or money from the government is used to pay for athletics. You are right that football is practically it's own religion, but have you ever considered that exact reason is why UT and A&M have better schools than us? Football brings in millions of dollars to those schools every year. Which doesn't necessarily go straight back to the school, but it is it's own form of advertising, appealing to top students around the country and worldwide. Harvard got to where they are on the back of their football team. Do you not wanna be Harvard?   /endrant"
UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,Kalfira,2,Mon Apr 13 18:29:18 2015 UTC,Came here to say this and you beat me to it. Thanks for keeping the faith!
UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,UHRossy,3,Fri Apr 17 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"I don't actually know you but given you have UH in your reddit name I feel like you may have a bit of a horse in this race outside of what is on the surface.  But beyond that every single point you made is rife with inconsistencies. You cited that the lowest attendance last year was ~21k. But you attribute half of those to students that you have absolutely no basis on. Obviously I don't have any more information than you do here but those numbers don't pass muster. Unfortunately I couldn't find any stats for UH specifically but in general student attendance of games has gone DOWN not up and they make a rather small percentage of the games attendees. In fact based on some cursory searches the numbers of people who go to games are usually far more in favor of alumnis and people who live nearby.  Secondly, 15%? Seriously? You act like that's something to be proud of. Just as a sample I check A&M and they have a 25%-30% on campus rate, and the ones that live off campus, are no more than a few miles away. Compare to UH who services a city of 2+ million plus the outlying smaller cities. This is greater than the population of Austin (UT) and College Station (A&M) combined, twice over. Further Houston is one of the least dense major cities in the country, just as an example it's 25 miles from my house to UH and I live in one of the closer ""greater houston"" areas. It's patently ridiculous to claim the experience is even remotely the same.  Lastly, I note you mention that you assume that my concern on the fortune we spend on football comes from the government. I never said it did, and even if it did it's irrelevant. The issue I have is at the end of the day this is money that could be better spent, well on practically anything else.   You are right that football / spectator sports can bring in revenue, as well as it ""advertises"" for the school. However do we really want the type of students who determine where they lay the foundation for their career success by the football program? I would say no. In my opinion Universities exist solely to be institutions of learning not perverse manipulations of an existing system to drive revenue and profits. When you start making decisions that affect your students based on how much money you are going to make is where you pervert the very goal of the organization to begin with.   You ended your argument by positing that Harvard got to where it is because of it's football program. Now I could argue how that isn't true but it's immaterial. The answer is, I would want to go to Harvard now, I would not want to go to Harvard as a football school. The reason Harvard has the prestige and value it does is because it consistently produces highly effective, highly successful graduates. Not because it's football program was good some time a century ago."
UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,Pathis,7,Mon Apr 13 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry for having a username that shows I'm proud of the school I just graduated from, but it is just that.   Those were assumptions that I clearly outlined as such, based on my actual perception of the attendance because I was at most of the games last season. Regardless, that was pure conjecture and I can't prove any of that, but neither can you, so it's a moot point.  Again, the housing % was in 2007. You do know it's 2015 right? We now have almost double that, as evidenced by the number of housing facilities we've built since then, as well as the article below. Funny you should mention A&M as having more housing than us, because you're right. But you know who in the state of Texas has more on campus housing than UH? Noone. So no, it's not ridiculous to claim the on-campus experience is comparable. Hell, we even had our frat-scandal! http://www.chron.com/news/education/article/University-of-Houston-could-require-freshmen-to-5691529.php  If you don't want that ""type of students"", then frankly you must not care about what quality of education you receive. Think of all of the best schools in the nation. Now consider what their football teams or basketball teams have done/are doing. Outside of MIT and a few similar outliers, they have all dominated in the athletics world at some point. Enough such that they attracted the best applicants, which in turn attracts the best professors, followed shortly by the most research money.   So you can raise a fuss about the way the system is run all you want, but UH is not getting to the level of any of the top universities without athletics. We're too far behind in the race. Top level athletics breeds top level academics, they're not mutually exclusive. It's not like Harvard was a community college when it was a top-tier football team. Why not take advantage of that system? Everyone else is. If we don't, then we'll be left exactly where we started: Cougar High.  So do you want to be the Harvard of the 3rd Ward, or Cougar High?"
UniversityOfHouston,32g9x5,TheAll-Pro,2,Mon Apr 13 20:04:24 2015 UTC,Harvard of the 3rd Ward has a nice ring to it. We can't let TSU beat us to that distinction!

The only reason why people are so afraid is because the reports on these incidents are blasted in your face.   You should appreciate this, most places you wouldn't even hear about it.  This shit happens in any other city.   Everyone thats not from Houston (that includes you katy, pearland, clear lake, woodlands, etc) or not from a large city need to get smart quick.  Don't walk in poorly lit areas  Don't walk alone if you don't have to  Don't walk around at night with your valuables showing. This includes your phone texting or your $400 headphones.

It initially started out around 8-10 people and we played The Resistance, Werewolves, Munchkins, and Risk  But last month when I organized it we had 19 people show up and had some intense games of Werewolves!  We usually play once or twice a month on a Saturday evening and it goes on for about 5-7 hours.  The problem we've been having with having 12+ people is accommodating comfortable seating for that many people, we pulled it off well at the Architecture building last month but I'm not sure we can do that all the time.  Let me know if you guys are interested, pm me with some way to reach out to you, and ill keep you in mind when the next one comes up.

UniversityOfHouston,3200q5,ThursdayAddams,5,Thu Apr 9 15:33:27 2015 UTC,"I've got weird mixed feelings about the Agnes Arnold bathrooms. On one hand, little pull down shelves for your purse seems a little patronizing, not to mention that purse shelves perpetuates the problem of women's clothing having shitty pockets, but, on the other hand, they could be useful if you do carry. For the extra dose of irony: that's where the WGSS department office is.  /end ramble"

They're basically asking for ladies to flush their super-fun-lady-time stuff down the toilet, which we all know clogs it! They really need to buy some little, cheap trash cans to have in the stalls. I'm so over wrapping applicators up in toilet paper and sneakily throwing it away in the trash cans by the sink. It's gross/embarrassing!

UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,newsnb,4,Thu Apr 9 03:08:02 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It's very worrying that these thugs clearly think there will be little chance of a police encounter.
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,calculatemyluck,4,Thu Apr 9 03:21:01 2015 UTC,Yes that's exactly it. They know that campus police can't and won't do shit. They've made major bank off of us and won't stop because why would they? It'll take time but gentrification is the answer.
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,SU7sin1o3,2,Thu Apr 9 05:10:18 2015 UTC,it's only a matter of time until they rob the wrong person and pay for it.... or kill someone.
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,Starlightbreaker,0,Thu Apr 9 06:12:00 2015 UTC,"I think you missed my point.  I don't expect police to stop every single robbery case. What I do expect is a bigger police presence in areas that are notorious for crime.  You said it yourself, they probably would have gone on somewhere else if a police officer was patrolling the area."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,coogdude,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you are insisting we have to look at the problem on such a grand level.  Yes, targeting the source of the crime with education and knowledge etc etc etc would one day have a positive effect, and i'm sure that the class of 2045 will be grateful for the reduced crime. But what about now?  What about students who want to walk to their cars without having to worry about being robbed?  I do not think asking for a little more police presence in areas we know are being targeted is a 'knee-jerk' reaction.  It's not like people are getting targeted across campus, it's specific locations. And I will never understand this aspect of 'we have to teach students about crime prevention'.  I don't need to be educated, I just don't want to get robbed.  By the way, people get attacked all the time during robberies.  Just because it hasn't happened on campus yet, doesn't mean that it won't."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,josefalanis,5,Fri Apr 10 03:15:02 2015 UTC,but so close to the dorms in broad daylight is just absolutely ridiculous.    Welcome to UH.   Basically still the same thing that's been happening for years.
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,RingSlinger55,18,Fri Apr 10 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"I agree that there is a necessary need for some form of higher security, but I think the true issue lies in the surrounding area of the University. Gentrification is a process which has been occurring slowly over time, but the process is exponentiating as far as schedules go, and that is easily seen with the Metro Rail about to go into full service. As long as more money and interest flows into the area, the infrastructure will improve, and with that comes more desirable areas due to property demand rising.  TL;DR: More commercial interests and gentrification of the surrounding areas will fix the crime. More security required nonetheless."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,josefalanis,-13,Fri Apr 10 21:06:30 2015 UTC,What's the point of your comment? We know what gentrification is.
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,PiratesWrath,11,Thu Apr 9 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"I think his point was pretty clear. Yes more security is needed, but as the area develops it will also help with the current problems... hopefully"
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,FuzzyHasek,-8,Thu Apr 9 03:11:23 2015 UTC,So then lax security on campus is ok because the surrounding area will eventually improve. Maybe.
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,cschultzy56,8,Thu Apr 9 03:53:29 2015 UTC,"Campus security is laughable at best. They seemingly spend all their time either waddling around parking lots trying to find cars to tow, or congregating their adorable little golf carts together to chit chat.   Honestly you could get rid of the security and I doubt I would feel remotely less secure."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,BlackJackalope,13,Thu Apr 9 03:59:15 2015 UTC,"40,000 students. If someone got robbed every day it would take 111 years to get through the student body. 100 crimes in Houston totally different then 100 crimes in Podunk."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,mikesauce,-2,Thu Apr 9 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm looking forward to campus carry. I carry literally everywhere but school, which coincidentally, is the place I'm most likely to get robbed.   Yea more security/campus police would be nice, but I much prefer at least having the option to defend myself."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,BlackJackalope,10,Thu Apr 9 23:12:24 2015 UTC,... How would campus carry help? If someone is robbing you at gun point you're not gonna draw your gun.
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,mikesauce,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:27:11 2015 UTC,"It's a great deterrent. Not allowing guns on campus lets less-honest folk know where easy targets are that won't defend themselves. That's only compounded by the fact that the school is next to a lower income area. It's a scenario that guarantees that the only ones who have guns on campus (aside from the few-and-far-between security) are ones who don't respect the law. Even if most people wouldn't draw their gun if they're being robbed, robbers would still think twice about committing robberies on campus knowing that it's a possibility."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,BlackJackalope,3,Thu Apr 9 06:13:22 2015 UTC,"... Guns on campus would only allow half of junior and seniors to ""protect themselves."" What about everyone else then? Do they not have that right? So only target younger kids?  Also you said it's a deterrent? CHL is allowed in the general public but people still get robbed all of the time. Also, once again if you're getting robbed at gun point you're not gonna pull you gun. That just escalates the situation."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,mikesauce,0,Thu Apr 9 07:56:59 2015 UTC,"Even 1% of our students carrying is enough, it's not about having everyone armed on campus, nor it is about people going gung-ho getting into shootouts over $20 and a velcro wallet. It's about making criminals think twice about trying to rob students, knowing that there's a possibility that they can defend themselves. Right now we look (and are) defenseless to them, so they'll continue to prey on us until either they know we have the option to defend ourselves, or we have adequate security to defend us.   And that's an honest debate, whether or not the public in general is safer because of concealed carry. But in either case, we're still an area that's known to be gun free, where that's not a guarantee elsewhere. That makes us an easy, or at least easier and safer target."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,BlackJackalope,7,Thu Apr 9 08:16:45 2015 UTC,So you think that if 1% more of us carried guns outside of security it would curb robberies? And what possibility of defending themselves are you talking about? In this instance the robber had already pulled a gun. Explain to me how having a CHL would help in this situation.   So you're saying allow CHL's in hopes it will get rid of robberies? In hopes.
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,leopardboy,-2,Thu Apr 9 08:18:35 2015 UTC,"Again, it's not about actually defending yourself in the situation, it's a deterrent. No one who carries a firearm thinks that whatever is in their wallet is worth finding out if they can draw their gun faster than the other guy can pull a trigger. Even if you had a gun on you right next to your wallet, just hand it over and be done with it. Easy way to guarantee you don't get shot, which at the end of the day is the most important thing. Although in the case of a violent assault or rape it might be different, and someone may be very glad they were armed.  It's about making criminals wonder if the victim might fire at them after the robbery, or if maybe someone walking by is armed and see's them and is compelled to intervene. Or maybe the person they're going to rob is crazy enough to try to pull a gun back and they both end up getting shot. They're less likely to rob someone they have to wonder that about than someone who they know is safe to rob."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,mikesauce,4,Thu Apr 9 08:22:27 2015 UTC,"So you mean just give them the illusion that perhaps the student has a gun? Regardless of if they think you have a gun,  if they've already drawn on you, they know you won't draw, they already have the advantage."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,BlackJackalope,4,Thu Apr 9 08:25:04 2015 UTC,what if the criminal had a knife instead? i think a gun will be handy. there was a stabbing incident not too long at lonestar college...
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,clarkclark,0,Thu Apr 9 08:37:45 2015 UTC,"Either way, if you're being robbed its probably better to just go along with it. If you know you can defend yourself, that's your judgement call, but there is risk involved.   I still say the idea is a deterrent, which has been mentioned as the main point in all of my replies on this thread. Yet opposition to the idea of campus carry hasn't addressed the deterrent aspect for some reason."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,mikesauce,-2,Thu Apr 9 08:52:28 2015 UTC,".... And if the robber pulled a knife on a freshman, they wouldn't have a gun anyway."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,BlackJackalope,2,Thu Apr 9 15:59:18 2015 UTC,The chance that someone may have a gun and may shoot them when they pull theirs with the intent of intimidation is a huge deterrent. Most of these fucks don't even know how to properly use a firearm and just use it as a form of intimidation.  Do you know how hard it is to accurately shoot a gun from a passenger seat through the drivers side window is?
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,leopardboy,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what you're not getting about the deterrent part of this. If a robbery has already begun, go along with it and play it safe. Give the robber what they want. The idea is to prevent robberies from happening in the first place by making criminals have second thoughts about it."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,royalsego,-2,Thu Apr 9 20:09:22 2015 UTC,"No. I don't think you understand. Even if you were carrying a machine gun, if they have their gun on you first they have the advantage. All drawing a gun would do is escalate the situation. Basically you both lose. Is your life really worth a laptop?"
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,mikesauce,0,Thu Apr 9 18:42:20 2015 UTC,"This makes complete sense, idk why it doesnt to some folks here..."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,mikesauce,0,Thu Apr 9 17:46:06 2015 UTC,"If it's to deter the criminals, then we shouldn't conceal weapons at all, simply walk around campus carrying a shotgun with a strap over the shoulder. What you're suggesting is borderline militia, fighting fire with fire can be a good approach, but not on the grounds of a scholastic haven of a University.  Last thing we need is to have a vigilante open fire on 'suspected criminals', which will spiral the gun debate to the forefront of social debate.   Yes, UH is located in an impoverished area of the city. Yes, it's truly upsetting when fellow students are robbed at gun point. but let's leave it up to the police and security to do their job, or we can urge them to do a better job by way of demonstrations and protests, but to take up arms at a place where your goal is education, enlightenment, and become scholarly just seems the opposite of what everyone here, students & faculty alike, is trying to accomplish."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,InquisitiveLion,3,Thu Apr 9 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, where did you get the militia idea from? Is the general public a militia? All I'm saying is that we should have the same right to defend ourselves as the general public.   And I agree with you, it should be the police and security's job, but if the funding or willpower to make that happen isn't available and they aren't going to defend us, why shouldn't we be able to?"
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,royalsego,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"And no, displaying your firearm isn't the same deterrent. The idea is to make them second guess themselves: ""Maybe this guy has a gun on him, I don't know, so I maybe I won't risk robbing them"" vs ""Hey I know there's no chance this guy has a gun on him, easy pickings! Time to flash my glock."" Open carry gives them a better idea of who is armed and who isn't, and again they're just going to go for the easy targets just like they are now when they know that none of us are armed."
UniversityOfHouston,31yduq,unclerico87,2,Thu Apr 9 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, open carry has been written out of campus carry, so that even if open carry passes, campus s carry will stay just concealed."

UniversityOfHouston,31ydte,srassen7,5,Thu Apr 9 15:22:44 2015 UTC,UT and LSU will never play us. UT won't play us because we're a bit of a trap team and they also claimed they wouldn't play us because Robertson didn't hold enough people. We were scheduled to play LSU when Keenum was around but they cancelled the game and scheduled a cupcake team instead. We can't get any meaningful opponents to play us. UH has nothing resembling a rivalry; Rice is the closest thing. It's a pretty friendly rivalry but it's something a lot of students from both schools look forward to.

UniversityOfHouston,31bs36,Panderonomio,12,Fri Apr 3 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"fact that it's a commuter school   If we were a commuter school we wouldn't have more people living on campus than UT. We wouldn't have 3 large  private student apartment complexes coming up next to campus in the next year in addition to the several already here.  Anyway, and I say this all the time, the best advice to give someone is: don't commute, especially not as a freshman."
UniversityOfHouston,31bs36,Sup6969,5,Sat Apr 4 16:06:28 2015 UTC,"UH is not a commuter school, it is a commuter friendly school. UH as a good campus life but is not a party school... if you want that go to another Texas school. I lived on campus on year, commuted the next, on campus the next, and have been commuting my last year. Commuting is nice and good for certain people, others not so much. Remember that Houston traffic is a real bitch and every morning you have a test you can gurantee that whatever freeway you come in on will decide to close every lane but one ;) I love commuting there but also really like living on campus (Lofts or Place only). Each has its merits and I wouldn't write a ""dorm"" off as a waste of money."
UniversityOfHouston,31bs36,politicize-me,5,Mon Apr 6 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"I've known plenty of people that say that they're just fine with being a commuter, but in my experience, living on campus is a better option by far. That said, if you feel like the money justifies enjoying yourself a little less, go for it. There are a few things you should consider first, though:   I cannot emphasize this enough - IF YOU ARE COMMUTING, GET A GARAGE PASS. I know it's more money, but the people I've known without Garage Passes have had to get to campus as much as an hour before their first class just to find parking.  You're going to be commuting in pretty heavy traffic. If it's a 30-minute commute without traffic, you should factor that in. Maybe make the commute a few times before you make a decision? Generally, I wouldn't advise commuting from anywhere outside the Belt. That's just me, though. It may be worth looking into alternative means of commuting. If you're one of the lucky few on light rail (you're probably not if you're 30 mins away) that might be very tempting. I've also known people that have had good results with Metro buses. If you're not used to driving around heavy foot traffic, commuting may be a bad idea. People on campus (myself included) have a tendency to ignore the fact that there are, like, so many cars around. It's frustrating and kinda terrifying.   Honestly, if you're a High School student, I'd just advise taking one of your college visit days to try driving around the campus. Get a feel for it at around 10 AM-ish. If you're not feeling it, live on campus."
UniversityOfHouston,31bs36,brak_obama,5,Sat Apr 4 22:25:54 2015 UTC,Check out /u/TTTA and what they are doing on campus.  UH has an on-campus experience and it appears to be constantly improving. Plus the rail line connecting the campus to downtown opens in about a month.

You have a lot more time to get work done. For those that commute, let's say that it takes them one hour to get to campus and one hour to drive back home. Those two hours lost for commuters are two hours that students living on campus can spend studying and doing assignments for classes. Two hours seems like nothing on print, but in college every hour counts if you're spending your time wisely. On top of that, living on campus means you can study in the comfort of your room instead of dragging your laptop, books, and binders to the library.  You'll never have to fight for a parking spot. At UH, parking your car is tough, and the most convenient spots on campus are gone long before noon. Plus, parking permits are expensive and only last for a semester or two.    You don't have to think twice about where you're getting your next meal. For a lot of commuters, however, every day they have to make breakfast, make lunch to eat later on campus, and when finally back home, make dinner.   You can wake up 15 min before your class and make it, commuters can't do this."
UniversityOfHouston,31bs36,ArtimusX,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:01:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you're a freshman, just go live on campus the first year or two. Once you're near graduation, time to get a feel for the real-work life, as many people in Houston commute to their jobs an hour and deal with traffic. With the parking situation, if you're there at 8AM(even 9AM) you can find parking. Again, think of it as going to work, since most jobs require you to be there by 8AM or 9AM."

UniversityOfHouston,314oei,linduhh,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:16:38 2015 UTC,I joined. Don't think I ever really got anything out of it. At least a hundred people became members at the ceremony with me.
UniversityOfHouston,314oei,piyoucaneat,2,Thu Apr 2 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"What you put in is what you get out, no? How much effort did you put in?"
UniversityOfHouston,314oei,linduhh,2,Thu Apr 2 09:32:46 2015 UTC,"That's fair. I didn't really put in much because I graduated a couple months after initiation. But I also didn't really see any opportunities. Other orgs have sent emails about events to do things like welcome new students, career fairs, etc. and I never received anything like that from PKP. What I do get is a quarterly newsletter asking me for money and talking about the national organization and how they offer things like scholarships. I still can't pinpoint anything of substance that PKP actually does on campus. The only thing on the calendar on their website is the initiation banquet, and if that's all they do, they aren't providing any sort of useful benefit to their members."
UniversityOfHouston,314oei,piyoucaneat,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:13:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for explaining further. I won't join if the only opportunities are a dinner and accessories for graduation. I wonder why Khator would endorse an organization like that.
UniversityOfHouston,314oei,daswarser,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:14:41 2015 UTC,"I'm graduating in May, so I'm probably going to get nothing really out of it.  I mainly want to join just to add it to my resume and possibly network at the banquet.  Do you remember how the banquet was?  Was it a formal event?"
UniversityOfHouston,314oei,daswarser,2,Thu Apr 2 16:08:34 2015 UTC,"Fancy clothes. Alcohol for sale. Dinner was alright. Then someone gave a long motivational speech, they recognized the students with the highest GPAs, and then everyone lined up and got their certificate and cords. A lot of people came with their families. It seemed like a really good opportunity for a lot of students to show their families that they weren't just screwing around in college."
UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,needs_tree_fiddy,32,Wed Apr 1 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"If you didn't cheat, then you should have nothing to worry about. You have the right to face your accuser and listen to their case with supervision present. Go with the department hearing, speak your case, stand tall and proud, nothing to hide. I'll spot you tree fiddy if things go sour."
UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,royalsego,12,Wed Apr 1 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. If OP didn't do it, the hearing should be a breeze. If OP did cheat, I would just take the F. Either way, it seems kind of chickenshit for the professor not to at least notify the student."
UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,Obnoxious_liberal,9,Wed Apr 1 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies, I think I will be going to the hearing.  The hearing officer said that professors normally don't talk to the students beforehand because they have ""substantial evidence"". I don't understand how they could have substantial evidence, let alone any."
UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,tokyoro,4,Wed Apr 1 18:22:50 2015 UTC,"I am a TA, and just so you're aware, professors and TAs are instructed NOT to speak to the student about violations of the Academic Honesty Policy. I know it sucks that it came out of the blue for you, but we have to go through a certain set of rules if we suspect a student of cheating, in case it does turn into a big deal and a hearing is necessary.  If you're innocent, choose the hearing. The burden of proof will be on the professor. However, you should also be aware that there are forms of cheating outside of what can be caught with turnitin.com type websites."
UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,Starlightbreaker,2,Thu Apr 2 04:11:31 2015 UTC,"+1  i sent several students to department hearing, and basically couldn't tell the student directly.   The evidences really need to be clear, and most of the time, it's quite complex.   However, some people just too stupid when they really have to cheat, especially when they do it blatantly.  If you cheat, at least put an effort to not to make it like an exact copy...sheesh."
UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,waffle_waffle,-1,Thu Apr 2 06:06:37 2015 UTC,"Fight the power if you're innocent, and bitch like hell at the hearing that you got no correspondence from the professor.  False accusations are BS.  Same happened to me when I was in undergrad."
UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,yakovgolyadkin,6,Wed Apr 1 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"Bitching like hell at the hearing won't help at all, and will likely hurt him. OP should just calmly present his case that he didn't cheat."

UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,jmknsd,4,Wed Apr 1 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"As others have said, go to the hearing. You have nothing to lose if you didn't cheat. Stand your ground. Don't worry about it. It's BS."
UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,yakovgolyadkin,5,Wed Apr 1 19:58:36 2015 UTC,"An easy bit of proof in your favor is to bring copies of former assignments to prove that is your writing style. The person who cheated will have a different style on their papers.  Protip: raise hell, but don't loose your cool. You can make a BETTER impact if you remain polite, but firm, and persistent in your defense."
UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,r56,4,Thu Apr 2 06:39:32 2015 UTC,"Think about where you did the assignment. Is it possible another student could have copied off of you, or taken a digital copy after you finished?  I TAed for a professor a few semesters ago for a CS class, and the cheating in general was always blatantly obvious. I did have one student who came to me afterwards and told me he copied off someone else's monitor in the lab, and while he was taking the F, the other student was innocent. I went back and looked at the code, and sure enough, the amount of copied code was about one screen's worth. Since the other student was one of my most engaged, I was inclined to believe he was innocent, but I had to push my professor pretty hard to let it go once it started.  If you're innocent, go for the hearing, but if not, don't think you can fool them. Your professor alone has probably had to deal with dozens of cheaters a year for many years, and gotten very good at catching them."
UniversityOfHouston,312x8q,smoky_bourbon,3,Wed Apr 1 22:55:38 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, if you didn't cheat, appeal it and go to the hearing. I used to be on the academic honesty panel for CLASS. You'll be able to fully present your case.  However, if you did cheat, my advice would be... ;)"

UniversityOfHouston,3122x7,tedwurds,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:42:40 2015 UTC,Non violent. If it was violent I would have immediately contacted UHPD. Its the same idiots that used to camp out by the CBB.

I guess to students, the subtlety is inconsequential.  At the end of the day, it's part of your fee bill...  Anyways, the cost is being paid via the continuing education funds, so undergrads and the like won't foot the bill for it.  For 150k tho, couldn't we have gotten a bush or a clinton?"

UniversityOfHouston,30o3bp,soyesachica,8,Sun Mar 29 15:38:49 2015 UTC,"Athletics did not want students on the field. Can you imagine how trashed it would have been?  The memorandum of understanding between the student government associated and athletics/admin and finance permits 1 free student event per semester.   Since the cost is on them, they wanted to Minimize it. Students being in seating and not on the field minimizes the number of officers required and the clean up isn't scattered across a hundred yard field.   Frontier Fiesta should turn into a one day event. At the end of the day this is a lot for students to handle. Administration doesn't take the event seriously and as a result only a few students seem to enjoy it all three days.   Frontier's primary focus should be concerts. The cook off should be an alumni event, and the students should just be out there all day. Imagine a festival type event with three or four big artists starting at 7 and ending at 12. I guarantee students would love it more the cougar casino."
UniversityOfHouston,30o3bp,greaterhoustonian,3,Sun Mar 29 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right. A series of concerts and events over one Saturday rather than 3 days would be an excellent way to use the space they are in now. 3 different nights will always result in a bad turnout for all but the most desirable concert, and in the stadium small crowds look even smaller. I was there Thursday, there were no more than 50 people in the stands for the headliner...that should never happen. I think after this year there needs to be some serious thought put into overhauling the Frontier Fiesta concept. Hell, give S&E oversight of the concert portion and charge for entry so some desirable artists can be brought in."
UniversityOfHouston,30o3bp,Mind_the_Empathy_Gap,6,Sun Mar 29 22:49:30 2015 UTC,Agreed. Even Schoolboy pointed out that that we were way too far away.  It was set up better last year.

UniversityOfHouston,30o3bp,yolonazi,0,Sun Mar 29 05:17:30 2015 UTC,I think using the stadium was a good idea. when you have a facility like that why not use it? plus logistically moving stuff in and out of stadium would've been less disruptive than using that lot.

UniversityOfHouston,30o9ni,steple,2,Mon Mar 30 22:50:00 2015 UTC,A better question to ask is what electives people enjoyed the most
UniversityOfHouston,30o9ni,SometimesY,5,Sun Mar 29 20:59:59 2015 UTC,I've never understood the mentality of wanting to take the easiest course possible in a subject. You don't really get much out of them and you don't challenge yourself or grow. Maybe I'm in a vast minority on this issue though.
UniversityOfHouston,30o9ni,someguy50,3,Sun Mar 29 17:54:09 2015 UTC,It comes with maturity and age. To OP: take something you know nothing about and sounds interesting
UniversityOfHouston,30o9ni,haydoods,2,Sun Mar 29 19:07:47 2015 UTC,"its because tbh my other courses provide more value for the amount of time spent in working for them. I don't want to spend a lot of time on humanities courses because they don't provide value to what I'm doing with my career. Yes if I was doing a different major then I might consider taking a challenging humanities course but at the moment I can't afford to spend more than a limited amount of time on a humanities elective because my other classes are not only more valuable, they're also harder and require more time.  That is why."
UniversityOfHouston,30o9ni,Hou_mcbp,3,Sun Mar 29 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'll say this:  my major had nothing to do with humanities either, but the one I took (World Cinema with Adair-Kriz) provided so much more value than I could have imagined.  Not to my career, but to myself as a person.    Thinking that college is just about preparing you for the work force is pretty misguided, man.

Cal2 is also extremely straightforward and fairly easy so I would just go ahead and skip Cal1, if you feel like you have it down. I always wish I had skipped Cal1 so I could've gotten ahead in physics and what not.   Both were easy A's for me. (For reference, I made a 5 on the AP cal exam)"
UniversityOfHouston,30o0qx,newsnb,2,Sun Mar 29 15:05:31 2015 UTC,"Have you already taken the AP exam? You won't be able to skip it otherwise. The calculus sequence at the university level is very fast paced. You cram what you did in one year in high school in one semester. It's not bad if you keep up with the material but if you have already taken the AP, it's one less slightly stressful course (in terms of workload) that you have to take."

Personally, I would take Cal 1 as a nice GPA buffer and it'll allow you to pick up some information that you may have forgotten.   Through personal experience, the people who were ""just good at math"" their luck ran out in Cal 2. For many, it was the hardest math class and they couldn't make it the first time. So be sure you actually are okay in all your concepts in Cal 1."
UniversityOfHouston,30o0qx,FliteSchool,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:26:05 2015 UTC,You will most likely only use Cal 3 material so go ahead and save some money and time and not take Cal 1.

Just fill out a form and plan the event (Maybe in conjunction with an ASME meeting, or another event). You'll need to track down 3 people who have participated in the event in the past who are willing to come to the new one, one of which needs to be willing to do the induction speech.

UniversityOfHouston,30elzs,imconfusedman,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:18:05 2015 UTC,Take stats over the summer. Smith will give you hw. Too much stress for something that you'll never remember 5 years down the road.
UniversityOfHouston,30elzs,Tip6243,-1,Mon Mar 30 18:24:12 2015 UTC,"Stats with Smith in the fall won't be hard if you do work consistently everyday. Plus there are so many resources at your disposal. However, I've heard from other students that stats in the summer was easy because you don't cover as much material due to the short length of the summer semester"
UniversityOfHouston,30elzs,srassen7,3,Fri Mar 27 01:04:16 2015 UTC,Id sign up for Stats with Bregman and go to Smiths classes mainly. I took her class and actually did okay (B) but her homework and tests are a pain. She can teach and explain it fairly well though.
UniversityOfHouston,30borh,RopeJoke,6,Thu Mar 26 01:34:26 2015 UTC,Its videos like these that make me want to change majors. Some majors are long boarding for a project.

We bitch so much, but we've got each other's backs. (But honestly, our bitching is completely justified)   Eh, just another year (or two) and I get to be free and make bunches of money. A 9 to 5 job working for $30+ per hour sounds like heaven right now and I'll get that easily upon graduation..."

I've got friends in industry and they agreed that school sucks, but the industry is a whole lot better and you're doing real work and your teachers aren't trying to fail you anymore.   Also, I'll only have to work 40 hours a week, which is about half what I'm doing now, while not getting paid for it..."
UniversityOfHouston,30aq1z,InquisitiveLion,10,Wed Mar 25 21:13:09 2015 UTC,"Universities are often a place of volatility in personal lives, between grades, relationships, stress, and being at the age which mental illnesses often manifest, I don't think concealed, or open carry is something I would want on my university campus with all of these above factors at play."

All of these pressures exist outside of our little 'university bubble' as well, and all the commuters that carry outside of school are dealing with these same issues, and still carrying responsibly while dealing with these same pressures.   And don't worry, open carry has already been expressly written our of the law for campus carry. You will likely see people with empty holsters this coming week, but they're to start conversations, as concealed holsters would be kinda pointless."
UniversityOfHouston,30aq1z,3RUNNA,0,Thu Mar 26 23:46:33 2015 UTC,"Just because you don't have the mental capacity to understand firearm discipline doesn't mean others don't. I am mentally stable, don't drink, and I commute everyday. I have been robbed before, and I definitely think having a concealed weapon would provide an extra but neccesary last resort if it came down to my life, because the parking lots at UH are not safe at all. Concealed carry permits aren't handed out either. Should we discriminate those who wish to defend themselves because you're afraid of them having mental illnesses?"

We aren't going to win anyone over by telling them they're stupid, we just hurt our cause every time you attack someone instead of their argument.   We need to respect the fact that some people just don't want to carry a firearm, and we have to be okay with that. When others that are neutral and on the fence about our cause hear you calling someone stupid for their opinion, how do you think it makes them feel?   I'm tired of hearing 'you're stupid' when someone disagrees with someone else's view point. Yes, I'm on the same side as you are, but we don't need to talk like middle schoolers and we need to stop calling people names.   If you want to talk more, I'd be up for it."

UniversityOfHouston,30aq1z,3RUNNA,0,Wed Mar 25 23:41:14 2015 UTC,Gee man it sounds like unarmed students are in a pretty rough spot. Say... just how often to armed robberies happen on campus anyway?
UniversityOfHouston,30aq1z,RingSlinger55,3,Thu Mar 26 06:40:28 2015 UTC,"We've had 300+ robberies in the past 3 years I've been here including one armed robbery 50 yards from my room, 15 yards from a security guard, and 300 yards from the police station, as well as another in the basement of a dorm.   I'd say it's a problem. Especially since we have groups of young men beating women up, throwing them on the ground, and kicking them, after which they could have done anything, but they only took her backpack and phone.   We are in a bad part of Houston, it will and does spill over to campus. We don't go looking for danger, it finds us and doesn't care if we're in a gun free zone."

I don't understand you kids survive in such an environment.Man I'm going straight to the media.  But first, could you please prove to me with a credible source that 300 robberies happened on the UH campus in the last 3 years? Just for my personal peace of mind, so I'm not acting off of totally false information."
UniversityOfHouston,30aq1z,RingSlinger55,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"You don't have to be armed to kill someone, we've had knives pulled and several strong arm robberies, once of which ended with a girl getting kicked while she was on the ground, which could easily kill someone.  I never said we had 300 armed robberies, we just had 300 robberies. here is that report you wanted buddy.  Also, the armed robberies have increased more than 5 fold in 3 years, not a good sign...."
UniversityOfHouston,30aq1z,RingSlinger55,2,Thu Mar 26 18:18:45 2015 UTC,"stun guns are just about as pointless as a kinfe (which is a stupid idea as well) as you have to be within arm's reach of the person to get them with it, and once you break contact they come back angry and just as powerful. They don't make you pass out and they don't make your muscles stop working. I've been tazed by mine and my roommates and I was just able to pull away, it didn't take much.  Mace is good for casuals that just want a target that won't fight back but will not stop determined criminals that want more than just your wallet or money. Most over the counter stuff is cheap and it sprays as a mist, which will most likely (on this campus) either blow back in your face, or just blow away. It does not remove the threat, it just tries to distract the threat just enough for you to get away, as seen in this example. That whole time he was shooting, he could see and that's enough to close distance, grab on to you and start beating you to death. It's hard to see the world without rose colored glasses, but some people are just messed up (see: knockout game).  Edit: This is a much better video."

UniversityOfHouston,307brq,coaxfun,18,Wed Mar 25 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"Any University worth its salt should be able to handle criticism. Especially a university that goes after a fairly low key subreddit.   Am I UH's #1 fan? Yes. I chose to go here versus other schools and don't regret for a second.   However, I don't think any subreddit should be a huge echo chamber of how awesome we are (especially when a PR team contacts the mods about taking down a logo that only benefits both parties).   This is not an official moderator stance on the matter which is why I won't distinguish my comment. This is just my response to you as a regular redditor."
UniversityOfHouston,307brq,Gh0stw0lf,3,Wed Mar 25 02:34:21 2015 UTC,I see your point. How a person defines the role/function of this sub remains subjective. I agree that  this should be a place where we discuss/celebrate/critique UH. But there are better things I'd rather see on that sidebar than a self deprecating joke. Not because I'm offended or anything; just cause it seems out of place.  I really think UH students complain too much. Not talking about this particular thread/comment but generally ppl bitch too much I'm sorry to say. Every university has issues but UH students think they're smarter than the people who run this place. yes there are some issues in administration but the student body is bitter af.  I have only been here for a year and half but I don't hate it as much as others.   just my two cents.
UniversityOfHouston,307brq,yolonazi,8,Wed Mar 25 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"You have valid points. I still think the takedown request is stupid as hell, there are plenty of other university subreddits that don't receive trivial harassment from their institution. I can't imagine how this could be a bad thing - no one who can rub two brain cells would think this is an official UH website.  I'll concede that they feel they need to protect the trademark lest they set a precedent for someone in the future to use it negatively. If nothing else, they ought to have creative commons licensed graphics."
UniversityOfHouston,307brq,dsnchntd,2,Wed Mar 25 04:27:37 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, that's my personal opinion, and I'm not requesting that it be taken down specifically, just expressing my feelings about it.

All things, by definition, includes criticism.     With that said, Go Coogs!

I say ask them to send a e-mail from an official UH account within a few days in order to confirm that this is in-fact the university, if they cannot comply, re-instate the UH logo. Other than that we can send an inquiry to the SGA.  This seems fishy to me."

Unfortunately, in recent years, it has become less and less attractive for non-greek students, much less non-students altogether to want to go.  The last few years that I've gone it is like 90% private greek parties, 9% walking around, and 1% overpriced cheap-quality beer.  I haven't seen carnival rides in a long time, and the concerts have taken a nosedive because the budget for big names is used elsewhere in the year. Bottom line is that Frontier Fiesta needs to get their shit together.  Frontier Fiesta was never meant to be just a huge greek festival."

I am willing to put up a couple dollars to fund this. As a student, and former resident on campus, it's easy to be a loner but it's people like you who make it better in their own way. Kudos. See you Thursday and if not, hopefully the next cook out after that!"

UniversityOfHouston,303pc6,cougarstillidie,3,Tue Mar 24 05:22:15 2015 UTC,Well first off make sure its above the 5th/6th floor. Im on the 5th (north tower) and the parking garage is right in my face when i open the blinds. Also try to get a corner room since there is more space. As far as downtown view im not too sure but i know that from the lounge on the higher floors its an awesome view
UniversityOfHouston,2zz6k5,coogie,5,Mon Mar 23 03:48:34 2015 UTC,"I posted in here asking about parking a month ago so I could take some pics around campus, but that same day I dropped my camera and had to get it fixed so today OP delivers...kind of.  I was hoping to find a vantage point where I could see the downtown skyline through the stadium, but unless I was on the roof of the Science Lab building or in the stadium, I don't think it's possible.  Anybody know of any cool vantage point to make that happen?    I have to say, a lot is different on campus since I graduated (2001 and 2005)...I was expecting the new stadium and science building since, but I wasn't expecting old Cougar Place to be gone and replaced...and you have light rail on wheeler now?  Very impressive.    I noticed the sculpture in front of MD Anderson is still rusty however."

Without being in the stadium there isn't a great place to capture downtown through the stadium, can't get high enough. You got something original though, the downtown shot has been done many times."
UniversityOfHouston,2zz6k5,HillbillyInHouston,1 point,Mon Mar 23 05:38:36 2015 UTC,"lol thank you for the kind words, but nobody wants to pay for photos anymore and want to give ""credit"".  I get offers a lot from publications who see my Houston pictures and want to use it.  Sometimes I agree, but other times I ask that if the are a for-profit, at least throw me a bone.   I actually offered the athletic department free usage if they would let me get into the stadium one evening so I could take a few pictures at twilight and they were receptive, but the construction wasn't finished yet so there issues with access."

UniversityOfHouston,2zz6k5,RootHouston,-7,Tue Mar 24 17:25:52 2015 UTC,"Very beautiful photo, but it comes with a very sobering realization of the high (and IMHO wasteful) cost of this stadium."
UniversityOfHouston,2zz6k5,midsprat123,4,Mon Mar 23 05:23:59 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, I have long graduated from there so from my point of view, anything that's done to raise the status of the university, without me having to pay for it again is fantastic; however, I do have some concerns that the university's new buildings will lead to increases in already high tuition and the university might be pricing itself out of grasp of the working class students that it used to cater to.   Having said that, Robertson WAS in pretty bad shape so if we're going to have a football team (I guess it's another debate whether sports bring in more money than they take for schools not in the SEC), we might as well have a decent one."
UniversityOfHouston,2zz6k5,QuattroStig,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:14:43 2015 UTC,"the university might be pricing itself out of grasp of the working class students that it used to cater to.   Let's get real here.  No regular student (especially not an 18 year old) can afford to pay over 10k a year to attend any university.  The U.S. government's financial aid plan caused a blank check for any university to be able to write, and have no actual consequences from the marketplace, because the government is subsidizing huge loans to students who will never be able to pay them off.  It will be an even bigger problem sooner or later.  It's not a UH problem.  It's a higher education problem."
UniversityOfHouston,2zz6k5,RootHouston,4,Tue Mar 24 17:32:07 2015 UTC,Robertson needed to go. It was an old stadium that was falling apart. However that does not mean I am okay with the how long it took to complete everything (stadium was not finished until after the season ended) and the over-run in the cost. I also do not appreciate the lack of water fountains for students
UniversityOfHouston,2zz6k5,midsprat123,-2,Mon Mar 23 12:54:24 2015 UTC,I can't make a comment on the old facility. But I can say it is disappointing to understand the cost of the stadium and how many empty seats there are even during the busiest games. Again just my opinion.
UniversityOfHouston,2zz6k5,QuattroStig,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:50:18 2015 UTC,"You haven't seen the busiest games.  Also, if UH ever intends to be in a power 5 conference, it needed to have a larger stadium."

UniversityOfHouston,2zz6k5,QuattroStig,-1,Mon Mar 23 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"I am not saying the upgrade wasn't warranted. I am only stating the planning and execution of the new stadium was poor and many feel the same way. There are many other things on campus (infrastructure, security,etc) that can be improved to benefit ALL students.  You don't need to go to the old stadium to define wasteful. When you spend $120M+ on a stadium you should plan to recoup the cost by filling seats. It doesn't require a business major to come to that conclusion does it?"
UniversityOfHouston,2zz6k5,RootHouston,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"So, what do you do with the millions upon millions of dollars that were donated to the university ONLY for building a new stadium? Tell those people to fuck off because it's not for ""infrastructure, security, etc.""?"

Tell those people to fuck off because it's not for ""infrastructure, security, etc.""?   Wow, for a poli-sci major I thought one might avoid knee jerk reactions. I never said anything of the sort. And of the $128M stadium cost, donations accounted for less than half of it.    You haven't seen the busiest games. Also, if UH ever intends to be in a power 5 conference, it needed to have a larger stadium.   Keyword: IF   The stadium was built with donations and with a fee approved by the student body. It was the largest turnout ever for a student vote.   Yes, nearly 2600 students voted against increased fees. It wasn't the majority, but that is still a large number of students that agree with me. I didn't realize that a past SGA senator would respond so poorly to an opposing position!"

The Honors College is really stellar -- I had such a great time there. I am now in grad school at a beautiful university in California and I still get home sick for UH all the time. Students there are just so real. So down to earth. The culture there is so much more about working hard and supporting yourself rather than swiping daddy's credit card without a care in the world. I didn't realize how rare that was at a university until after I left. It is not for everyone, but if those are the people you want to be around then UH is a great choice. There are so many people I went to school with who did such amazing things while we were there, and they did it all by their own bootstraps. They are still doing great things -- I get to see it on my Facebook nearly every day. I learned so much from my peers while I was an undergrad and I am a completely different person for it now. Man I am home sick again now."

UniversityOfHouston,2yxd3x,BlackJackalope,3,Fri Mar 13 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"If you're working for a company and are told that you cannot be promoted higher without a bachelor's degree, a school like UHCL might allow you to save some money. It might even provide you with a superior education.  However, if you need a degree that will open doors for you, you need one from a tier 1 university. It sucks and it's unfair but the reality is a lot of companies won't even talk to someone with a degree from a university they consider inferior. It's not about which school is better. It's about having the right credentials to make some HR person happy."
UniversityOfHouston,2yxd3x,smoky_bourbon,2,Sat Mar 14 03:54:33 2015 UTC,"I'm graduating this semester with a degree in SCLT. I've loved the degree plan. It has a wide variety of courses that really seem to cover a lot of great material. UH main, to my knowledge,  is the only campus in this area that offers SCLT. UHCL is NOT the same as UH Main. We're a tier 1 university and offer a lot of great opportunities. I'm a bit bias :)  I think you should go for it. Join SIDO as well. They send a lot of great opportunities for jobs and networking out to their members.  Best of luck!  Edit: Also, Bauer is one of the nation's top business schools, and they do offer a SCM degree. I just chose SCLT in the COT because I felt it covered more in logistics...whereas Bauer is more business oriented. And I've been in an office environment for 7 years, so I didn't really need anymore in that area lol.  tl;dr UH>UHCL"
UniversityOfHouston,2yxd3x,cashley5,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:56:06 2015 UTC,I'll definitely have to think about it. The fact that it's only offered at UH makes me a little worried.

Think of it...any functional business MUST have a functional supply chain. Whether they have it at their office, or use a 3PL.  I doubt you'd regret this as a major. It's a lot to learn, and it can be overwhelming because there are so many options, but it's awesome."

You can select all of them, none of them or some subset of them. I had to do this with my AP credits. I had over 30 hours in credits.

UniversityOfHouston,2yvhv2,cosmefulanit0,-2,Fri Mar 13 17:41:55 2015 UTC,"To be completely fair, golf carts are not licensed to travel on public streets.  While the driver that hit your friend was certainly at fault and should at the very least have to do some sincere apologizing and paying for injuries caused, your friend needs to obey all traffic laws.    In this case, he ignored a safety law and is now in the hospital.  It's unlikely he would've been similarly injured had he simply driven his car across the road or walked.    Since we're on the topic of golf carts why is it impossible for UH staff to cross campus on foot?  How many hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent on this idiotic golf cart fleet, and why can't we simply just walk like the student body does?    And above all - why it it necessary to drive the golf carts on the golf cart paths sidewalks all the time?  Apparently it's OK to drive them in the streets (see your friend), so why do they need to be operated on the sidewalks?"
UniversityOfHouston,2yvhv2,gongpo,8,Fri Mar 13 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"The carts we use are not ""street legal"", that's correct.  However, they are properly badged SMVs for occasional incursions onto streets, when needed, which is allowed by law.  That said, the person that struck the cart ran a red light.  That has little to do with the vehicle that was being driven..."
UniversityOfHouston,2yvhv2,gongpo,-3,Fri Mar 13 22:43:24 2015 UTC,"That said, the person that struck the cart ran a red light.   You changed your story a bit.  ""ran a red light"" and ""failure to yield"" are different things.  The left turn into E17 from Elgin is an unprotected left; it's very common for people to make that turn blindly when no traffic approaches Eastbound on Elgin.     That has little to do with the vehicle that was being driven...   This is completely and utterly false.  Cars are required to have standard safety features explicitly because they are expected to be on the road, and being on the road with other human drivers means necessarily that collisions will occur.  SUV's have mandatory curtain airbags - not because we expect other people to always follow the law, but because we know that they won't, and so collisions will occur, and we want injuries to be minimal.    I can't speak for the circumstances of your friend being hurt, and as I said the other driver was clearly at fault - that doesn't mean that we can't also assess that poor decisions were made on the part of both parties.  Sticking our fingers in our ears and blaming the driver of the car isn't going to prevent future injuries.  Driving cars or walking probably will."
UniversityOfHouston,2yvhv2,gongpo,7,Sat Mar 14 13:43:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't say what caused the accident, I was just reminding people to yield.

""No, just obey stop signs.""     If he was crossing the street *on foot when the light was ran, he would likely be in worse shape.   Yes, and if he was crossing the street while holding a vial if nitroglycerin, he'd be worst off of all.     You seem to want to make this about carts though, and I don't quite understand why...   We're on the topic of vehicular safety, and a UH employee was injured while operating a golf cart.  I can't imagine why anyone would want to talk about the safety of operating golf carts.  It really just goes beyond me."

Somehow your weird personal vendetta against golf carts honestly makes you believe walking is going to better protect you from a car? You still have to cross the intersection... which would put you in the street not matter if you're on foot, a bike, a golf cart, a car, a skateboard...

UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,yolonazi,23,Thu Mar 12 22:07:41 2015 UTC,"It's not just about sports; it's about culture.  Big parts of the administration fails students from even before they are admitted. The tours that are given to perspective students is terrible.  Sam Houston State's Tour Guides are very well trained, have headsets that they can radio back and ask questions.  The tour leaders send hand written post cards to each student asking if they have questions.  Our tour guides make shut up, bad mouth the campus,  and cracked jokes about running from robbers. Did you see the post a few days ago from the kid that couldn't  get an answer about his housing?  That wasn't an anomaly,  that's typical.  They don't even send admitted students a checklist after they are admitted. LSU does. A&M does. UT Austin does. Lots of parents see this lack of support and send their kids to community college and keep them living at home.  Financial aid office.  Enough said.  Get these fundamental flaws fixed so Freshmen feel like they belong to something and that will be a good start."
UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,MulderFoxx,13,Fri Mar 13 05:04:32 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the general consensus I noticed. The academics and athletics are doing a great job improving, but the administration is still miles back"
UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,ByHardenBeard,2,Fri Mar 13 05:12:38 2015 UTC,"While I agree our administration doesnt do a good job at a lot of things, I think it would be very unfair generalization upon the entire student body that they lack school pride because the depts incompetence. Every school has bad depts that work inefficiently and cause problems to students. I also would like to point out respectfully that I feel UH students complain a lot about a lot of things that aren't necessarily evil or intentional on the schools part. For instance the biggest issue parking: think about it you live on a city famous for its urban sprawl, go to a school where the vast majority commutes and you're complaining about the parking. Again, the dept is inefficient but there is only so much they can do. Of course I dont mean parking isn't a problem but there are many ways around it if you know your spots."
UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,MulderFoxx,4,Fri Mar 13 05:17:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that students lack pride because of staff. There are some lifer staff members who are dug in like ticks and can't be cut out and therefore do a crap job. There are also very dedicated staff people that love helping and working with students. The issue I am seeing is that the process that prospective students see FIRST is run so poorly that they don't get a strong sense of belonging.  If a campus like Sam Houston State is doing a better job of this than we are, there should be MASSIVE changes in the process, and if needed, the administration that handles these areas."
UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,Gh0stw0lf,3,Fri Mar 13 14:40:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks mulder, for saying things that need to be said. Any time I've had a bad experience at UH it was because a departmental fuck up or just lack of caring.   When I was prospective student the welcome center was such as bad place. The advisors were rude and I was like, this is what brand new students come to school with?"
UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,MulderFoxx,6,Fri Mar 13 15:51:12 2015 UTC,I have been at UH a long time and before that I worked at other Texas Universities. It is not a UH only problem for sure but bad / uncaring staff people makes the whole University look bad and personally pisses me off. (I'm sure CoaxFun feels the same way.)  Our mantra should be to treat students like future alumni because isn't that the PLAN?! Our goal is to have students to get their degree as efficiently as possible (UHin4) and then be an engaged alum for the remainder of their life (50+ years hopefully). How in the world do we think that will happen if we treat them like shit for the 4 - 6 years that they are a paying customer?
UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,gongpo,9,Fri Mar 13 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"Pride is a complicated thing.  There's no one single factor, a lot plays into it.  Here are the list of things I've always spoken to administration about when I have had the opportunity to express an opinion on the matter:    The general attitude that UH is a 'second rate' school.  It pervades everything.  Our students view themselves as not good/rich enough to get into UT/A&M.  Our professors view our students (and their own jobs) that way.  Our facilities look like shit.  Have you ever tried to ford Lake UC Satellite after a rainstorm?  Seen the mud patches that criss cross our campus?  Old, dirty, beaten concrete sidewalks - or the pebbled ones that are unwalkable in the rain?  Our campus looks like a dump.  It's hard to take pride in it when it looks so cash-strapped and poor.  No clear vision articulated by anyone.  Dr. K is a great speaker and very dynamic presence, but she never articulates a clear vision for the University.  She has a ""10% better"" attitude and not a ""100% better attitude.""  There's no ambition at UH, it's all - ""we'll get this fixed in a few years, and then move onto the next problem.""  Sure, it's 100x more difficult to do the hard thing, and reach for the hard goal.  And most people will think you're crazy.  But the resources for UH are there, and some people will stand with you and everyone else doesn't matter.  The focus on athletics over academics.  The single biggest mistake Dr. K has made in my view is spending the $25M in HEAF money on the football stadium.  She has tried to create an atmosphere of comraderie and excitement by building the athletic programs, and while it's good business it doesn't fix the underlying problems.  The undergraduate program sucks.  UH consistently ranks as one of the hardest programs in the country.  Harvard, eg, consistently ranks among the easiest.  I've spoken with faculty Deans about this problem, and their attitude is - 'it's great we stand out from the crowd.'  Difficulty is not an objective for its own sake - it only works if your students matriculate with more competence than others.  We don't emphasize competence (except in a few niches - the biggest being our Math Department), we emphasize 'performance.'  Administration's belief that the students are the problem.  In the last several years, the Khator Administration has raised admission standards for UH.  This move was widely lauded by faculty, alumni, and students.  The problem with this attitude is that it disenfranchises all current students, and shifts the blame of incompetent teaching and leadership from the faculty and administration (where it belongs) and on to a bunch of 18-25 year olds.  So much for personal responsibility, I suppose.  The lack of 'grind.'  Everyone at UH seems to have the mentality that we are one simple fix away from greatness.  The latest USNWR rankings came out, and we have been PASSED by Texas Tech.  Texas Tech just completed a very successful endowment campaign where they doubled the size of their endowment to 1.2B dollars.  These alone aren't indicators of failure, but circa 2 years ago we were far ahead of Texas Tech in the race for consideration as 'the next tier 1.'  So why are we losing ground?  Because we refuse to grind.  Success is a habit, as they say.  And it's one that hasn't caught on with UH faculty, administration, and so therefore students."
UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,turtlechef,3,Sat Mar 14 21:23:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the undergraduate program is ridiculously hard. I'm talking about the tests, mainly. They are so unforgiving for the most part and CASA is just a horrible experience."

UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,PiratesWrath,8,Fri Mar 13 01:30:37 2015 UTC,"To add my own personal experience onto MulderFoxx's comment.....that's entirely correct.  I'm about to graduate. And my entire time here I have made numerous efforts to get into the school spirit. I would go to every student event. I would go to every sports game I knew about. I would partake in Red Fridays and had a whole drawer filled with Red Shirts. It has gotten progressively harder to do so.   A brief summary:   Numerous issues with professors putting zero effort into their jobs. I have had maybe 3 professors so far whose lectures were actually helpful. The rest set up some form of road block to me effectively learning anything from them. This wouldn't be an issue, but the general response I get when I attempt to ask for advice on what I should do, I'm mat with complete indifference from them. Administration seemingly valuing Professors over students. I've had documented proof of professors talking down to me and being incredibly unprofessional. The administrations response is either ""We don't believe you"" or ""Try to work out this out privately"". Zero help from advisers. I was having trouble deciding on a major. I heard there were advisers that could help. They turned me away because I had already amassed too many credit hours (At Community College). Thanks. I finally pick a major. The advisers gave me the impression that i wasn't exactly welcome. I was to get in, get out, and stop bothering them. They always gave off the feeling that they didn't want to be there. And maybe they didn't. i get that. But I don't want to be at my sales job and I do my damnedest to pretend I do. Numerous problems with Financial Aide. I'd get a grant or scholarship, they would forget to add it to my bill. I get a loan, they  would deny it. To their benefit they always reversed those decisions with the excuse of ""We must have messed something up."" after I annoyed them enough. This has happened a total of 4 semesters so far. ""We promise this tuition hike for the new stadiums is only for a few semesters and X% will go to the new stadium and X% to Hoff."" Good to see they kept their word. New stadium had me excited....until we were shoved into the worst seats in the stadium. With malfunctioning sound. And no water fountains. Maybe they fixed it since. Don't care. It was a brickwall for my excitement.    And about a billion other problems. Calhoun Lofts is a gigantic fuck up. The tow trucks we have on campus seem to be operating without security over sight now and have broken more traffic laws than I can remember. Aramark has turned the dining halls into well decorated prison lunchrooms. All the wonderful controversy breaking out this semester....  Long story short. UH doesn't give me the feeling that they really want me here. They just want my money. Coming to UH was the biggest mistake of my life, I remain here only because it would be too cumbersome to switch now. And I have zero pride for an institution that treats me like an open wallet."

But those are forgettable. The real problem was this semester when they decided to ditch our AT&T TV/internet for UH wireless and this shit live TV service called Philo without any prior warning. One of the main reasons people liked the lofts was that service.  First...UHwireless is shit. Sorry coaxfun. But UHwireless is shit. It isn't as fast as advertised here. It drops often. Its shit. And now we don't have access to our own routers. Which means we can't have our own networks in our rooms. I had a nice set up where my phone controlled everything and now its gone. Thanks UH.  Second...Philo. Philo is a piece of shit. It buffers constantly. If you view it in a browser window it constantly stutters. If you use the Roku App it constantly crashes. Oh. And speaking of ROKU, UH has decided that randomly screwing us with no prior warning or say in the matter is worth about $70. Because they gave us ROKU 2's. Which suck. If you're going to fuck us over drop the extra $30 and get us a flipping ROKU 3.   OK. Rant over. Basically...if you like the rooms. Move in.

UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,yakovgolyadkin,2,Fri Mar 13 02:10:47 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. It is indeed a cultural thing and a vast number of UH students dgaf because of that. At the expense of bigotry, I really think some groups at school care very less about school pride and are just there for the degree. I honestly think school pride plays a role in networking and goes a long way. For instance, aggie rings are famous for being instant ice breakers."

UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,Fatguccibrr,10,Wed Mar 18 18:37:54 2015 UTC,For decades we were the safety school for people who wanted to go to UT or A&M or LSU and couldn't get in. Nobody has pride in their backup school. There are no legacy UH students like those other schools. No families of proud UH parents who got their kids excited about going to UH.

UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,Sup6969,4,Fri Mar 13 05:18:17 2015 UTC,"Things will improve once the rail starts working. Not a lot of options for people on campus now. Not enough bars, nightlife, movie theaters, game rooms, etc to keep people on campus past class. Not a lot of jobs in the area due to 3rd Ward. No community built up around campus.  How does that differ from A&M and UT and others? The university is the community there. UT is in downtown Austin and there's so much going on in the town around and all the students have minimum wage jobs at the shops around campus. Then they have things to do there afterwords.  Same in College Station. If you want something to do in town, there's nothing besides A&M.  Houston is so different because we have so many options. Give the school another 10-15 years and you'll see major improvements once the rail is running and some actual businesses pop up to cater to the new demographic that comes with improving public transportation."

UniversityOfHouston,2yueec,coaxfun,3,Fri Mar 13 01:02:54 2015 UTC,"That's a very loaded question from my experience. It ebbs and flows, but overall it gradually gets higher every year (11-12 being a big exception). People have far more than they did 10 years ago. I'd say at peak (times like the beginning of the school year or when football is doing great), we're at least at UT's level, a level that actually seems to be on a slight decline. Students get excited about how much we're improving as a university, but then get hung up on financial aid or whatever other basic student service that hasn't seen improvements.  We'll see a higher and more stable level once our current Coogs graduate. Our alumni are the people who really tend not to have pride, since a lot of them went here in the 80s-early 00s, when there wasn't nearly as much about UH to actually be proud of. We'll also see some progress stem from cub camp, housing/local area improvements, rising admissions standards, and (hopefully) improved athletics performance. It's just, we also really, really, really need to fix financial aid, advising, recuiting and orientation related services, etc."

All apologies if I have forgotten the course info - it was 1507, maybe?  Well, that lasted one class. I learned that while previously I needed 2301 and 2302 to complete my Spanish needs, I was now needing the first heritage course...and then two more.  They determined that I was a heritage speaker because I did well on the oral test (it also didn't help that I have a Spanish last name). It should also be said that my parents don't know Spanish at all. I grew up full-on English.  I hope that their testing has changed. My prof was a grad student who while well-intentioned, was extremely inflexible about this mess, ultimately forcing my hand and having to appeal to higher powers. Oh, and it was also a day or two after the last day for schedule changes.  In the interest of full transparency, this took place in the Fall of 2011. I assume the methods of testing have changed since then, and my Spanish experiences after this (including with said grad-student prof) were top-notch with no issue. Just do some research and if you didn't grow up speaking Spanish or were around it as a child, let that be known ad nauseam."

She starts by saying white queers can date whoever they want but that they won't pick black people, then goes on to say when white queers do pick blacks that's all they pick and will date every qpoc in their social group. Now the last situation is what everyone wants to avoid because that is essentially exploitation but the author picked a convoluted way to get to that conclusion.  tl;dr : she has a valid point but is not a good writer"

UniversityOfHouston,2yewyc,yoloismymiddlename,19,Mon Mar 9 16:45:31 2015 UTC,"Stalin's murder of millions is a better example of bad rediquette and conscience.    Seeing as how Stalin was neither a redditor nor a socialist, I have to say I'm not sure I see how that is related.  ""I'll take 'Famous communists for 200, Alex!'""  If we're going to list famous members of an 'ideology' and ascribe their misdeeds to the ideology they were assigned to by history let's start with Andrew Johnson, the ""Founding Fathers"" and the genocide of minorities in America - closer to home, after all.     Socialism/communism/fascism   Wow.  Where's the Sesame Street Music?  One of these things is not like the other, one of these things just doesn't belong.  One of these things is not like the other...  Socialism and Communism are economic theories.  Fascism is a political system.  Socialism and Communism are generally associated with liberalism; Fascism is generally associated with conservatism.    You might as well have said, ""Wood, leaves and the International Space Station"" for how well related the first two and third are.    Having said all of that - the fact remains that downvoting should not be done based on disagreement.  When someone says, ""does this exist at UH"" and they get downvoted, that's pretty transparently disagreement downvoting.     is responsible for more deaths than any other ideology, system of government or mass murderer.   Well you're going to have to provide a source for that completely bullshit claim.  Remember that most human beings died before any of these ideologies existed - like 99.999999% of all human beings died before they existed.  So it's hard to tie ""more deaths"" to anything that is a modern phenomenon.    Calm down with the hyperbole.  We get it, you hate socialism."
UniversityOfHouston,2yewyc,keepin_it_G-rated,-4,Mon Mar 9 19:48:04 2015 UTC,"Socialism and Communism are generally associated with liberalism   I don't really agree with this, especially with communism. According to wikipedia, Liberalism is a political philosophy based on liberty and equality. While Communism may have aimed for equality, the examples we've seen in history show us that it definitely did not support liberty."
UniversityOfHouston,2yewyc,yakovgolyadkin,5,Mon Mar 9 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"Communism has never been successfully implemented.  The countries that you think of as communist (the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, etc) all self-described and were externally described as socialist nations which were 'on a path to true communism.'  If you accept the premises of communism as true, then communism provides the ultimate form of equality (above any other political system).  Each has what they need and want, each contributes as they can.    The problem, as you pointed out, comes in in application.  That said, poor application is not a test of a theory.    Finally, I'd be very hesitant to subscribe to the ""wikipedia"" definition of a vague term like that which applies to a political ideology.  Because these definitions are subject to the whims of the polity, definitions necessarily lag behind use.  For example:  conservatives in American are in some ways far more liberal, and in some ways far more conservative, than their counterparts in Europe.  These things are highly fungible.    The one generalization that can be made, I did.  Liberalism and socialism/communism are generally associated."

UniversityOfHouston,2yewyc,yakovgolyadkin,8,Mon Mar 9 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"Those are three different things. Socialism is basically modern Scandinavia: high taxes, very strong social safety net, large amounts of public-sector services (free university, etc.). True communism has never actually existed in large scale, despite what countries like the USSR and China claimed. Those are still just dictatorships that nominally refer to themselves as communist.

Socialism itself is such a broad term that anyone referring to themselves as simply ""socialist"" or describing anyone as simply ""socialist"" without any further clarification is nearly useless. Democratic Socialism, which is what I support and which I was describing, doesn't push for the overthrow of capitalism. It pushes for the regulation and management of capitalism and strong government protections for the people.

I think Smith also has a level of maturity that Diaz had yet to reach.   This of course is my personal opinion based on what I've read on both candidates.  Edit: If you haven't seen it, here is a link to an AMA Diaz had on this sub earlier this month: http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfHouston/comments/2wm3hj/my_name_is_elisha_diaz_and_i_am_running_for/  Here are some articles on the candidates from The Cougar:  http://thedailycougar.com/2015/03/01/analysis-a-closer-look-at-this-years-sga-presidential-candidates/  http://thedailycougar.com/2015/02/26/sga-presidential-debate-talks-key-issues/"
UniversityOfHouston,2y94vt,RingSlinger55,6,Sat Mar 7 20:50:50 2015 UTC,"I read everything I could find and I wrote the summary:  Elisha Diaz (Computer IS Sophomore)   Wants to get a grant to help pay for textbooks for low income students. Agrees with freshmen mandatory residence, but with more student aid. Wants to improve parking. Wants to ‚Äúinstill a long lasting sense of community on campus‚Äù. Wants to create ‚ÄòGreek life‚Äô Senatorial Position. Agrees with ‚ÄúNo Confidence‚Äù vote to Carl Carlucci passed by current SGA   Shaun Smith (Civil Eng. Junior, Army Veteran)   Previous SGA experience (Speaker of the Senate). Does not agree with ‚ÄúNo Confidence‚Äù vote to Carl Carlucci.  Does not agree with mandatory residence for freshmen. Also wants to improve interaction in campus. About parking: ‚Äú(SGA) just can‚Äôt go to the administration and say they want to change parking,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt work that way.‚Äù.    Most are from direct quotes but I don't have time to post references.  Is there anything I missed?  I'll vote for Diaz again btw, but I think Smith is going to win.  EDIT:  Corrected point about parking. Sorry, it was an inaccurate oversimplification."
UniversityOfHouston,2y94vt,shaundarb,10,Sun Mar 8 03:30:12 2015 UTC,"Shaun Smith here -- I've lurked reddit for awhile, but I suppose this would be a good start to make a first comment on.  I have actually not stated that SGA can do nothing about parking, I know that the cougar may have misquoted me or I may have been misheard, but my position on parking is one based on reality.  Every year candidates will campaign on the the perennial banners of ""fixing"" parking and ""fixing"" dining services, but very few know how to actually get that done. Parking is an issue about money and land. In SGA I have already begin working on help this university fix its issues in both fronts.   Two weeks ago, SGA along with the Office of Governmental Relations arranged a trip for 150 students to visit Austin to speak to legislators at the Capitol. On the UH Legislative Agenda this year are Tuition Revenue Bonds, which are bonds that provide the school money to fund facilities such as parking. I personally spoke to several representatives and senators to encourage them to pass this measure and it was very well received from the Higher Education Committee in the State Senate and House. Ultimately, tuition revenue bonds will be the only way we can fund more garages or parking infrastructure on campus; the University debt service is already too high to take on traditional bonds and loans (we're still paying off some of our garages).  Further, I have been a party to the Campus Facilities & Planning Committee (led by Admin and Finance Assistant VP Emily Messa) where they discuss future allotments for buildings and other facilities on campus. This is where students can tell the Administration that it isn't acceptable to build on particular lots of land or, for issues relevant to this conversation, that they aren't accommodating well enough for parking. I've brought up these issues in these committee meetings and will continue to as the next Student Body President. I assure you that SGA can fix parking -- candidates just need a realistic plan rather than giving into sensationalist campaign pitches.  As an aside, the Transportation and Advisory Committee (TPAC) and Parking & Transportation Services (PTS) do not make the large, master plan level decision regarding the future of parking on campus. They are tasked with accommodating the student body, faculty, staff, and visitors with parking needs with the amount of resources they already have on campus. If there is a ""bad guy"" on campus regarding parking, it will be those who made the decision to build additional facilities and take on higher enrollment without adding adequate parking infrastructure with it over the past several years.  Edit: I also wanted to make it further known that UH is already planning its next parking garage to be built near the existing stadium garage next year. It is also provisioning for a 1,000 space lot to be built at the ERP to further accommodate for parking during its construction and to cater to the peak overflow periods throughout the year.  I'll be happy to answer any other questions folks have if they arise. Thanks for the opportunity contribute!"
UniversityOfHouston,2y94vt,shaundarb,3,Sun Mar 8 21:00:31 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the clarification and sorry for the mistake.
UniversityOfHouston,2y94vt,yoloismymiddlename,5,Sun Mar 8 21:23:51 2015 UTC,No worries! There's always a lot of noise with elections and with general University business -- it's just the nature of the system with so many stakeholders contributing to the overall culture and progress.
UniversityOfHouston,2y94vt,swaggyj03,6,Sun Mar 8 22:12:28 2015 UTC,"The problem with what diaz offers is that it's completely unrealistic.     Wants to get a grant to help pay for textbooks for low income students.    This is a Administration and Finance issue, not an SGA issue. How does Diaz expect to get anything done with A&F if he has, repeatedly, publicly endorsed the no confidence in Carl Carlucci resolution?     Agrees with freshmen mandatory residence, but with more student aid.    Again, A&F issue, not SGA issue. The SGA does not have the power to appropriate money. The SGA can pass bills and resolutions, but, ultimately, the decision is A&F's. It's like the No Confidence vote. It's a resolution. The administratiom can throw that in a trash bin and completrly disregard it.     Wants to improve parking.    SGA has neither power over TPAC, nor does it have the power to fund/defund TPAC. What the SGA president can do is make recommendations to TPAC and attempt to work with them, but which President hasn't? I know Prince Wilson, Michael Harding, Cedric Bandoh and Charles have done some variation of this. The problem with TPAC is funding, and, again, SGA has no control over that.     Wants to ‚Äúinstill a long lasting sense of community on campus‚Äù.    Good idea. How?     Wants to create ‚ÄòGreek life‚Äô Senatorial Position.    Diaz clearly hasn't read the SGA constitution. The Constitution is clear -- representation is college enrollment based. Is he suggesting restructuring the Constitution to fit a 'Greek Life' Senatorial position? In that case, maybe NSM should have a senatorial representative from the NSM council formed by the NSM senators last year as well.     Agrees with ‚ÄúNo Confidence‚Äù vote to Carl Carlucci passed by current SGA    How do you expect to get anything that concerns A&F (residential scholarships, parking, textbook grants, etc.) if you're putting A&F in a defensive position from the beginning?   All in all, I think Smith is a better candidate because of his experience with SGA and knowledge of the powers SGA does and does no have. Diaz seems to be lacking there, and it shows by his completely unrealistic platform."

UniversityOfHouston,2y75ky,srassen7,8,Sat Mar 7 03:22:28 2015 UTC,Which is precisely the problem with this shitty fanbase.
UniversityOfHouston,2y75ky,yakovgolyadkin,0,Sat Mar 7 03:42:20 2015 UTC,"You need a team that's worth watching to even have a good fanbase. What do all of the big programs with huge fanbases have? A history of success. Something that literally only our golf program has. You guys may not like to hear it, but that is why we have such a shitty fanbase.  I've been a passionate and active supporter of our teams since most of our student body was in middle school, and all I've gotten for it is disappointment over and over and over. There's only so much of this that a person can take. I'm burned out at this point."
UniversityOfHouston,2y75ky,srassen7,3,Sat Mar 7 05:57:13 2015 UTC,So making the Super Regionals last year and beating a very good LSU team at their place isn't worth anything? Or is a CWS appearance a minimum requirement for you? I understand not showing up is the ONLY vote fans have sometimes. Hell I did that a lot in Dickeys last year and a home game last year under Levine. But jeez we're 15 games into the year and you and everyone else are already quitting.
UniversityOfHouston,2y75ky,yakovgolyadkin,0,Sun Mar 8 16:17:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's worth something. So is the 12-0 season our football team had back in 2011. But having a single burst of success then falling back down into mediocrity is the problem. Building hopes up only to fail to deliver. A single strong season then failing the replicate it is not success. You want to build a fanbase? Have success for 3-4 straight years. Get students in their freshmen year excited and then, and this is important: don't disappoint them immediately. If we had our 2006, 2009, and 2011 seasons all in a row, our fanbase would be a lot stronger than it is now. But instead we keep having awful seasons in between our occasional good ones.  Yes, we're only 15 games into the year, but we're also already halfway to our loss total from last season. We are 8-7 now. Last year it was mid-April and we had 26 wins before he had our 7th loss. Also, given how our team performed last season, yes, a CWS appearance should be considered the minimum for this to be called a good season, and we are certainly not on the road to one with the way things are going."
UniversityOfHouston,2y75ky,srassen7,1 point,Sun Mar 8 16:47:05 2015 UTC,Sports aren't as simple as you make them seem here.

They are the ones that we need to not disappoint. The fickle fans. Because fuck knows our school is made up of a lot of them. Sports may not be simple, but people sure as hell are."
UniversityOfHouston,2y75ky,Burt-Macklin,1 point,Sun Mar 8 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"So according to you, the team is only worth watching if they play in the conference championship? Regardless of what you might think, a team can still be competitive and fun to watch even if they don't make it to their conf. champ game.  And fot the record, in '10, our first and second string QBs suffered season-ending injuries early in the season. In 2012, our coach, our staff, and about half our squad left the team. In 2013 ,the team was competitive and incredibly entertaining. And while this year was hit or miss, you can't deny the hiring of Tom Herman is a step in the right direction.  I was there for 1-11, and if you think the team was disappointing this season, then you don't know what real disappointment is."
UniversityOfHouston,2y75ky,yakovgolyadkin,3,Mon Mar 9 03:08:19 2015 UTC,"I really get the feeling you don't understand what I've actually been saying. This isn't about my opinion. I have been a passionate supporter of the teams for nearly a decade. I even worked for the team for a time.  This is about why we have a shitty fanbase. MOST STUDENTS are fickle little shits when it comes to our teams, and if you want a strong and loyal fanbase, you need to get them interested by winning consistently. You can't build a loyal following on a team that is consistently mediocre with occasional bursts of good.   And fot the record, in '10, our first and second string QBs suffered season-ending injuries early in the season. In 2012, our coach, our staff, and about half our squad left the team. In 2013 ,the team was competitive and incredibly entertaining.   I know. I was there for all of it. The reasons and excuses for our poor seasons don't do anything to get the fickle freshmen and sophomore students more interested in going to the games or supporting the teams. ""We would've had a good season if not for these reasons"" doesn't cut it with them. They don't care about the reasons for it, they just care that they went to see a game, our team lost, and they didn't enjoy seeing it, so why would they go back?  And yes Herman is a huge step in the right direction, but unless we get a 10+ win season and do it again the next year, a lot of the students who showed up in the first few games won't be coming back."

Driving is one of the worst parts about Houston, even if it's a short trip like I make from Montrose to campus.

You can only succeed if you absolutely love the field. yeah no one likes studying hard ass classes designed to go hard on you, but you have to like studying science/math to be able to succeed in this field. otherwise its gonna feel like a huge burden and you're gonna burn yourself out and (i hope not) drop out.   just being real."

They always make the most bizarre choices (last time they scanned your badge with an RF reader every time you went up or down the escalator, which meant you had to wait in line to go up or down stairs!), their guest bookings are mediocre and cancel frequently, and it's expensive.   If I'm going to a Houston con, it's Comicpalooza. Reasonably priced, great guests, big turn out, improvements every single year.   I went to PAX South this year in San Antonio, too.

It's hellishly hard in general, but especially here - at UH, ChemE is pretty much to engineering what engineering is to college in general - but god dammit if you get through thermo and fluids it becomes one of the most rewarding you can possibly do. As hard as it is (about 85% dropout rate) it's one UH's standout academic programs. Not many things feel quite so awesome as getting a 60 on an exam, then finding out the class average is a 35.

It's more of an over-sized go cart.   Now to the racer build... I'm head of the chassis team and we're going to put a 600 cc engine in with a 20 mm intake restriction (due to rules). We're going to put about 13 inch tires on the back and we'll tune it up for autocross and a bit of drag racing (I think 1/8th mile).

I hate the whole ""pass the torch"" phenomenon that's happened the past couple elections since it's not very democratic, but it kinda seems like redvolution is again where all the experienced or otherwise competent people have gathered.

Since their license plate doesnt link back to their account, the fines don't appear on their account. Though if they were to get a permit and add their license plate to the system i assume all those fines would suddenly be on their account.  Maybe this is no longer the case. the tickets ive seen in lots have never been connected to the city. Maybe a ticket for street parking like the meters by the stadium garage. Otherwise i cant see that being the case in regular lots."
UniversityOfHouston,2ws1ub,coxee,2,Mon Feb 23 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm not sure. But the UH police department is a real police department like HPD. So if you don't have a permit, they could probably send it in the mail."

UniversityOfHouston,2wm3hj,learn2die101,6,Sat Feb 21 02:22:17 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll bite.  Often in student governments, a cause that is dear to a previous representative gets kept in limbo by administrations long enough for that representative to graduate, and for new representatives to take over, and then that issue fades into irrelevancy.  What are your plans to carry out the legacy of those who precede you?"
UniversityOfHouston,2wm3hj,learn2die101,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:05:23 2015 UTC,"Our current administration has made some great accomplishments as have the administrations before it. My goal is to continue their legaccies of making a positive change on campus.   Being President is not a job done alone, I will have my Vice President and the entire executive cabinet. I will nominate only the best people to positions in my cabinet in order to ensure that my administration has a strong backbone for the student body. We will not be an administration that gets pushed around or waits until we are about to leave office to do something great.   As far as ensuring that the ideas and hard work of our senators does not get pushed under the rug or left in limbo, as you say, I will make sure that all of our senators can have their voices heard because they are the voice of the students that they represent and ignoring them is ignoring the students. I am for the students, always. COugars come first and every Coog matters."

Let me ask it again in a more detailed manner:  For current or past SGA's at the University of Houston, previous student representatives have had causes which they held dear to them in their terms. Which of the causes which they rallied around will you bridge into your administration? Please be specific.  Are there any particular representatives (past or present) whom you plan to continue their cause(s)?  What are your reasons for wanting to continue these causes / revive these issues?"

UniversityOfHouston,2wm3hj,Sup6969,4,Sat Feb 21 05:51:14 2015 UTC,"My favorite color is  blue. A nice kinda professional blue though, not too bright, not too dark. Something along the lines of a midnight blue.  Being a low income student, one of my biggest concerns is the crippling debt I am put in. I want to apply for a state, federal, or private grant so anyone that needs to take out $1.5K in loans and has an EFC under $1000 does not have to worry about the additional expense that textbooks burden many of us with. Many times we have to wait to buy textbooks and that time spent waiting leaves many of us behind on our school work. Students can already apply for book loans, but they still have to pay those off. I have heard many stories of students missing out on assignments and that just is not fair to them. Learning should be a top priority on campus and assisting students with the most need to put then on an equal footing with everyone else helps the University community as a whole."
UniversityOfHouston,2wm3hj,m4c,4,Sat Feb 21 01:57:07 2015 UTC,"I'm a staff member, but since I'm on TPAC, what's your opinion on transportation and parking policy?"
UniversityOfHouston,2wm3hj,Sup6969,2,Sat Feb 21 02:26:06 2015 UTC,"Our current policy is working well. Is it the absolute best? No. There are still improvements that can be made and hearing what the students have to say should come first. Commuters make up a large portion of the student population, if not the majority, and they come here to learn not waste time looking for a parking spot. When I'm in office I would really like to sit down and discuss with those in charge of transportation and parking so that way I can hear what they have to say as well. Working together on these issues helps in solidifying that sense of community my administration will work on creating. We are one big Pride and we all have a voice in it."

UniversityOfHouston,2wi6xv,SometimesY,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"Eh don't think it will happen. Anyone with an ounce of football knowledge knows it won't. Part of the reason that we weren't invited to the Big 8 when the Southwest Conference was axed was because everyone in the conference was fighting over Texas recruits. (Baylor also blocked our entry I think.) That is really bad for business. It diluted the recruit pool and also led to a lot of the violations everyone made to some degree. Moreover, we bring absolutely nothing to the table in terms of market. Houston is predominantly UT and A&M. I'm sorry but we will never be in a good conference again."
UniversityOfHouston,2wi6xv,SometimesY,2,Fri Feb 20 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"It's not likely but never say never. If I were running the Big 12, I would add: UH, BYU, Boise State, Cincinnati, UCF, and Memphis. Make it a 16 team megaconference. Now that would be interesting, not going to happen, but it would be interesting."
UniversityOfHouston,2wi6xv,yakovgolyadkin,2,Fri Feb 20 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"Those teams are arguably the top G5 teams and they deserve it but.. A mega conference is a good way to fail. It dilutes interest because it's hard to follow and is geographically unstable. Plus the Big 12 really prides itself on the round Robin style. I don't think they will add anyone for a few years and when they do, I think it will be UCF and Cincinnati because of their markets. Big 12 will need to find a bigger market so both of those make complete sense. Adding us makes zero sense."

UniversityOfHouston,2wczb5,MoldyMilkMan,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:58:36 2015 UTC,"I interned with Kiewit, more specifically I was with their division on Corpus Christi called Kiewit Offshore Services. When it comes to good companies to intern with, I don't know if it is really a matter of which company is good or bad, just that you are getting experience with what you are interested in doing. For myself I am pursing the industrial side of construction and have had offers from commercial companies for internships, chose to turn down those offers simply because they were not going to give me the experience I desired. Apply with pretty much every company that you can, when interviewing always ask what their internships are like. Also do a research on the companies you apply to, always impresses recruiters when you know about projects their company is involved in."
UniversityOfHouston,2wczb5,MoldyMilkMan,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:02:27 2015 UTC,"I graduated with a CM degree last may. Been working with a homebuilder for the last 2 years. They require you to take a semester internship and a class over it. Many of my friends stayed with the company they interned with, like myself. But if you are not liking that then it is good to have experience in a related field for another job after graduation.  Also, 90% of the classes are in the late afternoon or night, and typically once a week for 3 hours. Allowing you to work during the day which was nice. You will find that most of the other students work in the industry or have been for years.  UH is the only college that requires you to pass the AIC exam before graduation. It is typically taken the first semester of senior year and you can retake if you don't hit the target goal. It's also good to have the certification on your resum√©.  Only downside is there are VERY FEW girls enrolled in the program. Other then that I love my job and wouldn't be wanting to do anything else.   Good luck!

If it's more about working as a software development consulting firm, RED Labs wouldn't be a great fit, but if you have internal projects that could become stand alone companies, it would be great.

UniversityOfHouston,2vz7k2,yakovgolyadkin,3,Sun Feb 15 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"OP here: Maybe you missed the memo when former DC David Gibbs nicknamed our defense the ""Third Ward D"":   Gibbs' second year of what he dubbed ""The Third Ward Defense,"" named for the rough-and-tumble Houston neighborhood that borders the UH campus and practice fields ... ""They‚Äôre tough, most of ‚Äòem are tough, inner city kids who are fighting like crazy to get out a place like the Third Ward. Even if they‚Äôre not all from that area, they‚Äôre stereotyped that way,"" Gibbs says.  ""It's the neighborhood we live in,"" says McDonald. ""You go to the store and it's dirty, nasty. You see a lotta crazy stuff people like me, where I'm from [Lawton, Okla.] aren't used to."" ""I knew the culture had changed last season when a regular pass was thrown in practice, fell incomplete, skipped across the turf and two of our defensive players ran as fast as they could to try and bring the ball back,"" Levine said.   As I wrote in the post, most of the local kids UH recruits are growing up in tough neighborhoods and grow up on hip-hop. I'm sorry if that bothers you, but that's the way it is. I'd be more than happy to write a post including rock or country music if they'd have the level of influence on the city as hip-hop does."

Maybe Steve Earle's ""Telephone Road"" but there's not much else.  If you want to write a blog post about other music that represents the culture of Houston outside of hip-hop, be my guest.

There are entrances in various places on campus, one notable one that was weakly secured was near the health center. Another tricky one is the circular vent near the Hilton, but you have to climb down a ladder to enter. Most are locked, but you can sometimes find them unlocked. Jussayin'.

I've never encountered a more inept, arrogant, and terrible boss than the fuckwit they put in charge there. Within a month at least half of the staff (all student workers) had been basically forced out and replaced by new people who definitely weren't students and who seemed to be friends with the guy running the place. They changed a bunch of systems we had in place that worked to overly complicated ones that were unreliable at best, and changed the focus of the ticket office from selling tickets to university sporting events into selling tickets for things like a John Legend concert. They even went so far as to remove the employee who would sit at the window at the ticket office, make them sit somewhere out of sight, and replace them with a bell.

Unless financial aid is covering everything, you could get a decent apartment and cook for yourself for less. And the food will taste better.  CV is okay if you get along with other people and don't mind sharing a tiny space but I lived with the most destructive group of people and it was just ridiculous. RAs either do nothing or can't actually fix real problems. CP gives you your own room but it was a dead zone when I lived there. Nice for studying but still, not worth the price and meal plan.  Right now I live in Bayou Oaks and it's the last straw as far as living on campus goes. The building is crap and stuff is always breaking, fire alarms go off constantly, and the frats are allowed to, and will, party all day, every day. They're doing it right now and the music is so loud it may as well be coming from my room.

That's the only reason why I'm moving to Cougar Place next semester. They don't get cold all of a sudden like the quads, but they do get very hot very fast. It burns. A lot. Otherwise, Moody was fine and the people are actually really cool. Some people get worried about the communal showers and to be honest, they aren't that bad. The only thing is that people tend to shit everywhere including the toilet seat (?WTF) and floor (?WTF). Moody is also very close to everything. It's central to literally everything.

I remember that I definitely put in time by re-watching his lectures and re-writing his slides in my own words but it got me an A even without points from a curve. This was probably around 2010/2011.

UniversityOfHouston,2uw8z7,cameron0208,5,Thu Feb 5 18:24:52 2015 UTC,What I really don't like about this is that Ward is a pretty alright QB but not great however O'Korn could have been great. Herman has a very good offensive mind. O'Korn would have done really well in his system I think.

UniversityOfHouston,2uw8z7,ShaolinMaster,7,Fri Feb 6 16:47:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, O'Korn did very well his first year as a true freshman in 2013.  The problem was after that season we lost our offensive coordinator to TCU and replaced him with Travis Bush, who was in over his head.  O'Korn regressed in 2014 likely due to the changes in coaching and the terrible job Bush did.  Bush was also one of the main reasons Levine was fired.  It'll be good for O'Korn to have a fresh start over somewhere else.  Sucks he regressed so much that he had to transfer but I wish him the best!"
UniversityOfHouston,2uw8z7,calidoc,2,Fri Feb 6 16:52:00 2015 UTC,Very good points.  His freshman year was stellar and I am excited to see what he can do with a great coaching staff around him.
UniversityOfHouston,2uw8z7,THEdROYAL,3,Wed Feb 25 01:02:23 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping he'd stay. I was very curious to see what magic Herman could pull with O'Korn.  He's a good QB. He has an arm, he's able escape, and he's fairly accurate. His 2013 proved all of this. Then he gets a new (lower quality) OC and everything changes. Now he's have to evade a lot more. Force a lot more passes. Throw a million screen passes. Play calling was working with what O'Korn does - that's why we made a switch."

UniversityOfHouston,2u3okk,FormerAggie,3,Thu Jan 29 17:49:01 2015 UTC,"Graduate schools mostly look at the last 60 hours and your in-major GPA is what matters most. Definitely aim to get a good general GRE. I suggest you try your hand at the Math GRE. UH does not require it, but it can really bolster your resume. Get a good recommendation letter or two from your previous professors at A&M. And most of all: contact a professor in the math department whose research interests you. If you have someone on your team for graduate school, there is a much better chance of getting in. If you need help sifting through some of the professors' resumes, send me a PM. I'm a grad student in the math department."
UniversityOfHouston,2u3okk,SometimesY,3,Fri Jan 30 05:46:17 2015 UTC,"While I don't have knowledge of specific UH graduate programs, I would encourage you to be optimistic.  I would also encourage you to research the situation well. For example, I too lacked the GPA to go to graduate school. But the University I did my graduate work had an alternative plan.  That is, I could be admitted conditionally and take up to three classes in part time status. If I did well enough in those classes, then I could be admitted to a specific program. (Note: Don't know if UH has similar options or not.)  Also, realize that different Colleges within the University likely have different requirements.   Best of luck!"
UniversityOfHouston,2u3okk,UnoKitty,2,Fri Jan 30 16:05:11 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with the admissions process for the Chem Dept, which is part of the same college as Mathematics (NSM). I believe the ""requirements"" are set at the college level, although it is possible for departments to get exceptions approved. A 3.0 GPA is nominally required, but we can go lower if the the GRE scores, rec letters, and recent grades warrant it. So you're not out with a 2.65 GPA, but the rest of your application will have to shine."
UniversityOfHouston,2u3okk,truthbox,1 point,Fri Jan 30 03:08:07 2015 UTC,"I have a 3.025 GPA right now and I'm aiming to go to the chem phd program. I just joined a research group and I still have 1 year before graduating, what do you think my chances are?"
UniversityOfHouston,2u3okk,Sgt_peppers,1 point,Wed Feb 4 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry, clearly not a regular redditor as I just saw this. Assuming you're a domestic student (i.e. that 3.025 is at a US school) a solid GRE score above 300 will likely get you in no problem. If you're an undergrad at UH, we would advise you consider applying to other places for your PhD, but if you really want to stay a 3.0 GPA and a good rapport with your research advisor would give you a really good shot."
UniversityOfHouston,2u3okk,truthbox,2,Sun Feb 15 15:55:35 2015 UTC,You miss 100% of the shots you never take. You're last semesters show an upward trend. Apply anyways.
UniversityOfHouston,2u3okk,BlackJackalope,1 point,Fri Jan 30 04:11:57 2015 UTC,Check out the MPA program. It is a good value and may interest you. You need a 3.0 over the last sixty hours.

UniversityOfHouston,2teosz,Sgt_peppers,2,Fri Jan 23 14:58:57 2015 UTC,"I took pchem 1 with Bittner during the spring semester of my junior year. Be prepared to work hard and spend a ton of time doing your homework. You will find his exams to be childsplay if you are able to think through and complete the homework in a logical manner.  Bittner also has an open door policy, so don't hesitate to go ask him questions or sit in his office if you don't understand or anticipate difficulties with the homework.  Ninja edit: He's also rather well connected in the science world, so if you need a letter of rec, make sure to ask him!  Second ninja edit: I just texted one of his grad students to perhaps lend you his insight about the course. Good luck op!"
UniversityOfHouston,2teosz,Ghand_Mooch,2,Fri Jan 23 17:46:05 2015 UTC,"I have. He's great! Lot's of people go through it thinking they're going to flunk it, simply at the really high level of the material he teaches. When really, he'll surprise you on the exam with just the basics. I straight up was about to drop simply because of how hopeless I felt, but eventually I ended up getting an A. id recommend to stay in the class."
UniversityOfHouston,2teosz,LELS1,2,Sat Jan 24 04:21:19 2015 UTC,"Hello, sorry for the late reply. But here's my 2 cents. Stay in the class and bust your balls.  Bittner is a really chill dude in general outside of academia. You could easily get lost in conversation with him especially if you like guitars, skyrim, whiskey, or sailing. As a professor, he's probably one of the best you'll ever have, and here's why. He is really enthusiastic about what he teaches and REALLY wants you to learn. Granted, it is high level material that almost no one understands the first time around. When I say ""learn"" I don't mean you should memorize a bunch of facts and regurgitate them back to him on the test. No. He wants you to learn, kind of like how riding a bike is so ingrained into your head, you can never really forget how to ride a bike. If you begin to understand the material, even at a surface level, you're doing the class right. Yes, his notes can seem scattered, but there's a train of thought in his head (even as a grad student under him, I still often can't keep up). If he's using the big McQuarrie book as your text, I highly recommend reading that through and through. 3 years after taking that course, I still refer to it. The book is well written. Working through the math examples will help grasp some of the concepts.  It is a challenging course and if you're not busting your balls for it, you're doing it wrong. NO OLD TESTS WILL HELP. I can guarantee that. For the homeworks and tests, the right answer isn't always important as the process by which you got it. If you understand the process and the math, that's all you need for the test. He'll explain A in class. You'll read B from the book. And he'll test you on C, which will upfront seem completely irrelevant to what you've seen so far. But to figure out C, you should be using the same processes as you did to figure out A and B. Example, he'll explain the thermodynamics of atoms and molecules, and you'll read about the math behind the thermodynamics of atoms and molecules, but you'll be tested on the thermodynamics of rubberbands. As long as you understand the thermodynamics, you'll be fine. If you need help with the material, do not hesistate to go to Bittner's office and ask. If you need a translation to english (sometimes you will) don't be afraid to ask one of his graduate students.   Learn Mathematica like you learned your alphabet. No amount of reading reference material compares to jumping in and coding things for yourself. I've been using it for 4 years and still learning new things about it. If you ever need help with Mathematica or the class in general, PM me.   Source: I'm the graduate student under Bittner /u/ghand_mooch is referring to."

Also write to your state congressman/senator and the texas higher education authorities. Might as well try UH system regents as well.

I don't generally get the impression that it's useful on its own and that your path forward would mostly be retail or food service management unless you already have some domain knowledge in another field.  A popular path I've seen for people I know are managers or running their own business is to do something else for your undergrad (most likely outside of the business school entirely) and then get an MBA."

O'Korn was by far not the only problem with this team to open the season. He is a much better pure QB than Ward, but Ward's style of play fit better with this teams holes.   I wish O'Korn nothing but the best."
UniversityOfHouston,2st8x0,Obnoxious_liberal,3,Sun Jan 18 19:01:58 2015 UTC,"He had a very good freshman year, but you have to admit he was garbage fire awful the games he played this season. He threw a lot of balls up for grabs in 2013 that didn't get intercepted and got kind of unlucky in that regard this past season. He really showed no progress from his frosh year, but you can put a lot of that on poor QB coaching. Why not at least have a Spring practice with a fresh slate and new coaching staff?"
UniversityOfHouston,2st8x0,srassen7,2,Sun Jan 18 22:46:36 2015 UTC,"Because he made plenty of stupid mistakes. You do not stare at your intended receiver, especially immediately at the snap because it gives your play away, and thus you get picked off a lot.   The O-line hating him did not help but his apparent lack of situational awareness also greatly contributed to the high number of sacks"
UniversityOfHouston,2st8x0,midsprat123,2,Sun Jan 18 20:49:01 2015 UTC,Bye bye
UniversityOfHouston,2st8x0,unclerico87,2,Sun Jan 18 15:27:18 2015 UTC,"rekt. I've always wondered something - When these guys transfer schools on a whim like this, how the hell does the academic record look? What if he's got shit grades and doesn't get accepted into the college of his choice at the university? Is it something like ""Fuck I need to transfer because I'm bad at football but UT won't accept my grades"" or is it ""Fuck grades I play football"" and he can just stroll into wherever he wants?"
UniversityOfHouston,2st8x0,THEdROYAL,3,Sun Jan 18 18:02:34 2015 UTC,"The latter. If a coach really wants a player, he will get that player. Fat chance that some players that play ball at the University of Texas could have gotten accepted based on grades alone."

UniversityOfHouston,2st8x0,midsprat123,8,Sun Jan 18 18:01:12 2015 UTC,He was the AAC rookie of the year last year. His performance had much more to do with coaching than him IMO
UniversityOfHouston,2st8x0,dk00111,3,Sun Jan 18 19:11:02 2015 UTC,No doubt. I also think that he let the hype get to him and O'Korn developed a case of the yipps.

With a few made free-throws and a couple less turnovers this team could easily be 12-5.    Coach Sampson is in a difficult spot, coaching a team filled with unproven returners and JUCO transfers, with a relatively inexperienced coaching staff.    Basketball is a sport where a home court advantage plays a HUGE advantage and Hofheinz is far from that.  It starts with the students, the rest will follow..."

UniversityOfHouston,2situ7,Phapatrick,7,Thu Jan 15 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"Its still winter break for students so I'm sure that was a factor. However, It's usually like that unfortunately. Coach Sampson came to speak to us in Bott's chem class last semester and he emphasized how important it was for lots of fans to come out and  support. It actually sounded like he was begging us to go to games. It's sad how nobody goes. I've been to a few and they are really fun to watch! The attendance grows on the days we play good teams (like Memphis, UConn, Cincinnati, etc.)"
UniversityOfHouston,2situ7,ShaolinMaster,3,Fri Jan 16 08:02:57 2015 UTC,"I completely understand where Sampson is coming from. When I lived in College Station, the woman's basketball coach would walk from door to door in the surrounding neighborhoods with free tickets asking people to attend the games. Flash forward a few years and they are one of the best teams in the nation playing in front of a packed house. They sure have come a long way from offering free hot dogs AND tee shirts to anyone who attended games."

It's not an issue if just one of you signs up and you deal with all that yourself as long as they don't catch you.  I thought it was okay. Very convenient since I went to Bauer. There were a few downsides though. Loud neighbors, neighbors that smoke constantly and staff that wouldn't/couldn't do anything about it (they couldn't always figure out what room it was coming from and weren't allowed to just knock on doors for some reason). Someone snuck their cats in right before I graduated and I had pretty bad allergies.  Internet, cable, and utilities were all included which was nice to not worry about.  I would say if the convenience for classes is more important than anything else, it's a good move. If you normally get to school early enough to not have to fight for parking, you could have a better experience off campus."

I also had a TV and multiple computers set up and generally was not eco friendly with my power consumption. I graduated December 2013 so it has been about a year, but it didn't seem to be something they actually monitored."
UniversityOfHouston,2rcn2u,lawhaze,6,Mon Jan 5 01:49:33 2015 UTC,"I'd rate it 3/5.  The cost of the furnished 1/1 I lived in wasn't worth the convenience.  I paid more for those 492 square feet than I now pay for nearly triple the floor space in Midtown, where I live with my girlfriend and dog. Yes, I now have a commute, but it's only 15 minutes, which is a tradeoff I'm happy to make.  I was in a north-facing room that had floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room. This was awesome because I love natural light and because the unit's standard lighting was absolutely awful‚Äîaside from the bathroom, there were only two of these dinky circular lights in the whole unit and they did next to nothing. Anyway, a buddy lived in the east wing of my floor and only had a single, very sad 2x2' window in his living room.  I'd definitely recommend a room in the north wing if you choose to stay there.  A few other points:   The fire alarm sounded ridiculously frequently, each time for drive-to-Wendy's-to-get-food-and-come-back-to-hear-that-it's-still-sounding periods of time. The sky lounge was totally locked down/inaccessible the entire year I was there. I honestly just got tired of being on campus and right by where my classes were. I felt like I could never get away. There aren't enough RHE parking permits for every Loft resident, which made parking really frustrating. I never had overages or issues with the staff (it's weird that there are RA's, but I never met mine)."
UniversityOfHouston,2rcn2u,SleepyAsian,2,Mon Jan 5 08:15:44 2015 UTC,"I've lived in the Lofts for 1.5 years in a single unfurnished efficiency and I'd rate it a 4/5.  Most of the residents are very quiet but there are exceptions.. mainly the athletes that live there.  Thankfully you are able to swap rooms before a new semester if there are open rooms so that is what I did.  Gotta be fast though.  Pro-tip: avoid any rooms that are XX01, they are right next to the main elevators and have the most traffic (especially the first floor) so unless you wanna hear people and the elevators dinging at all times of the day and night.. stay away.    Like another poster has said, electricity, water, cable, tv and internet are included.  Dunno what the electric limits are but I've never hit the cap and I run two computers 24/7.  The rooms are nice enough and personally I thought the extra cost was worth not having to fight traffic and parking to get to class but ymmv."

For the second year I was living with my SO - I literally never got any hassle about it (we always came in through the side door, though, so there's that.)  Pros: Food is close by, it's nice, and you have all of your utilities taken care of. If you get a parking space, it's pretty close to the door as well.  Cons: Expensive. If you have bad neighbors, it can be loud (but getting to know them helps! I had loud neighbors for a month, then got to know them...once they knew I heard how loud they were, they quieted up.)  Overall, it's a great place to live. I only gave it 4/5 because it's expensive, but being that close to campus and having a space of your own is definitely a luxury."

UniversityOfHouston,2r6me3,ToadChief,2,Sat Jan 3 19:16:28 2015 UTC,Totally understandable. The email service is a nice idea but it would make more sense if it were run by an association for alumni or whatnot as students have their own emails already. My suggestions should only be considered after any official uses for the school have been turned down.

Just go to access.uh.edu, log in, and look for ""software center"". You can also go to the Cougar Byte and get your software there.  As an MIS major try and join MISSO, it has a small fee for each semester ($20 or $40) and these people will help you through class and getting a job plus they make good drinking buddies at times.  Be prepared to code. If you've never coded then approach it like math; practice the material and do the assignments early so you can ask questions and google what you don't understand before you get your exams. Good luck and welcome :)"

Java: 2 professors to currently choose from. Randy Cooper, and Husein Panahi.  Cooper: WILL MAKE YOU LEARN. He is kind of a sarcastic jerk. But he's funny. He will make you learn. He will call you out in class and make you answer in class. It sucks, but trust me it works. He hands out worksheets for you to look over and practice.  Panahi: Laid back, his class fills up fast because people dont want to deal with the above. He has powerpoints you can download.   Choose Cooper.  Database class: Dona (I think) Murphey is the professor."
UniversityOfHouston,2qnyh8,unclerico87,2,Mon Dec 29 21:17:33 2014 UTC,"Yes, agreed, choose Cooper!"

UniversityOfHouston,2qnyh8,ClassicYotas,1 point,Sun Jan 11 17:16:40 2015 UTC,Cooper will drill the lesson into you. He is always reinforcing what he teaches. He asks questions and calls on people in the crowd to answer his questions. He distributes worksheets and works on them in class.

Most academic advisors want to knock this out as quickly as possible, but they still have to check each student to see that they fulfilled the requirements to graduate... times the number of students that graduated (in Bauer's case ~600 undergrads). Might be until February for it to pop.   IF you need a letter confirming that you will receive the degree, contact your academic advisor directly."
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,yolonazi,11,Sat Dec 20 21:00:40 2014 UTC,Yes I am. We're going to have the best coaching staff we have had in many years. I think we will finish top 15 next year.
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,SometimesY,7,Sat Dec 20 23:19:21 2014 UTC,Lets just hope we get the OC position sorted out
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,midsprat123,4,Sun Dec 21 00:13:02 2014 UTC,Wouldn't surprise me if Herman is calling plays too
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,SometimesY,3,Sun Dec 21 02:09:14 2014 UTC,We have Major Applewhite as OC which is possibly exciting for us.
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,Pathis,2,Sun Dec 21 03:38:23 2014 UTC,"I was pretty excited about that until someone pointed out that Applewhite's offensive scheme probable ended the career of David Ash. Come to think of it, Herman is on this 3rd string QB due to injuries. Hopefully those two get that sorted out."
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,SometimesY,3,Sun Dec 21 08:43:33 2014 UTC,"He's been really inconsistent. Sometimes he's been really good, sometimes really bad. I think Herman will right the ship though."
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,SometimesY,2,Sun Dec 21 15:29:44 2014 UTC,you think two good seasons might help us in getting invited to a different conference?
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,Pathis,3,Sat Dec 20 23:39:22 2014 UTC,"I hope so but I'm not so optimistic about getting picked up by a new conference. However if UCF gets the nod by another conference, I think we will get picked up by someone."
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,SometimesY,3,Sun Dec 21 03:42:20 2014 UTC,I'm really concerned that Cincy and Memphis will get picked up before UCF or even Houston. They are still close to P5 areas and add a little more geographic spread (read as: few recruiting areas overlap).
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,SometimesY,3,Sun Dec 21 08:39:15 2014 UTC,Yeah that's a concern for sure. People over in /r/CFB were thinking that they would get the nod for Big XII which sucks.
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,zhunter556,1 point,Sun Dec 21 15:30:34 2014 UTC,Yeah but for all that to happen we have to get really good in our conference
UniversityOfHouston,2pwyfa,mcabbas1,2,Sun Dec 21 04:15:47 2014 UTC,Yeah for sure. My comment was predicated on that being the case.

Apparently a good place to live is Calhoun Lofts (Too expensive for me) So I'm applying to Cougar Place.  Anyways, in response to off campus, I have a friend who lives about a 10 minute walk from UH and he pays ~$600 for a 2 bedroom apartment. The downside is, he lives in the hood and constantly talks about the fights he hears outside of his windows. Nothing bad has happened to him but just know thats an option if the hood doesn't frighten you.  Other than that, start searching craigslist and apartment finder. The postings at the lobby of the library also have the occasional good deal."

UniversityOfHouston,2pdbvn,Phapatrick,9,Mon Dec 15 16:23:26 2014 UTC,yesss
UniversityOfHouston,2pdbvn,mcabbas1,8,Mon Dec 15 18:13:01 2014 UTC,I really want him to do well out there if he plays. It sucks that last season he was put in for the first time as starter in the middle of an already terrible season and with a terrible O-line and a predictable coach. Here's a second chance and hopefully he does enough to excite the haters.   It sucks that his career has pretty much tanked after being released considering he was a star here at UH and in cfb in general.
UniversityOfHouston,2pdbvn,humanzombiekiller,2,Mon Dec 15 22:20:40 2014 UTC,This made my day.  I just want him to have a chance with a decent o-line.
UniversityOfHouston,2pdbvn,RootHouston,0,Tue Dec 16 00:38:24 2014 UTC,"He is not a good quarterback.  I know he went to U of H and was great when he was competing against guys who weren't very good.  But now that he is competing against the best of the best it is obvious he sucks. He just isn't very good.  There is a reason NOBODY picked him up after being released from the Texans.  He is good enough to be on the Rams practice squad and that's it.  You are not allowed to be on a practice squad more than two years, so he was definitely headed out of the NFL shortly.    If he has 1 good game then next 4 games will be horrible.  That doesn't help the Texans at all.  It's too bad he hasn't worked out.  I would like him to do well but he won't.  It is  unlikely any of us see a U of H quarterback starting in the NFL in the next 30 years."
UniversityOfHouston,2pdek6,humanzombiekiller,5,Mon Dec 15 16:47:38 2014 UTC,"He's the guy I've been pulling for since it was announced we got rid of Levine. This is amazing for the school if this ends up being true. He did amazing things with OSU this year, and he was the one responsible for Rice's amazing 2008 season. He's a miracle worker.  Now if we can just grab Keenum for OC after this season finishes up and the Texans cut him again, we'll be unstoppable."

I used to come at 11am or 1pm and find parking instantly. 7AM the campus is dead and you will find parking.
UniversityOfHouston,2pf2b4,humanzombiekiller,3,Wed Dec 17 05:49:39 2014 UTC,At 7 am you should be fine finding a spot. Anything past 9:30 and you are looking at driving around and following people to their spot

Hopefully you get the full size bed instead of the rooms that just have two of everything. Plus i have a corner room so its definitely bigger!

UniversityOfHouston,2p9kha,darthscone,12,Sun Dec 14 18:22:09 2014 UTC,"I lived at Cambridge Oaks for a year for all of 2012. It is absolutely awful. They force you to use their internet service, the gates are always broken, they don't have a way to pay your rent online, and the walls are super thin. The staff are dicks, they do random ""inspections"" of your apartment without prior notice and they'll just walk right in if you don't answer the door fast enough. The grounds are absolutely disgusting, people throw their trash every where and the staff doesn't bother to pick it up. The appliances are ancient and they don't respond to your maintenance requests for days or up to a week. Oh and if you have problems with your internet, forget it. They'll give you the run around with their host company every time.   It's ridiculously over priced. I paid $1060 a month for a one bedroom that was 650 square feet. You can find a place that is about a million times nicer for the same price within 10 minutes away.  People from third ward are constantly coming in to steal bikes, I had one stolen and had to keep the second one in my house. Not to mention a whole mess of little kids coming to swim in the pool.   And the biggest thing, you cannot, break your lease and leave early. If you want to leave the rest of the whole year's rent becomes due. Seriously, do not walk away from this place. Run, run as fast as you can away from Cambridge Oaks."
UniversityOfHouston,2p07jn,calculatemyluck,9,Thu Dec 11 20:18:43 2014 UTC,I'm not sure how the policy has changed since I graduated so the best advice I can give you is: ask your academic adviser in your college. You pay them a lot of tuition money for them tell you how you should school.
UniversityOfHouston,2p07jn,Pathis,5,Thu Dec 11 20:27:31 2014 UTC,"The first 60 do matter, because grad schools and employers taking in fresh college grads look at your cumulative GPA.   I messed up my first 30 hours by partying (pretty much straight Ds for a year), and then got straight As for the remainder of college. My GPA isn't stellar, but I graduated summa cum laude. I've had a mixed bag of results trying to get employment after school. Some employers seem to think along the lines of ""Oh, well you were young, and now you've matured."" and others seem to think that it means I'm unreliable or less intelligent than other potential hires because I have a 3.24 GPA.  Either way, it's been 7 months since graduation and I still don't have a job.   Sigh..."

The quickest way to get a job you want is to network. Get a part time job, volunteer, do something. Youll get a job way quicker by meeting people face to face than by sitting at home applying online to jobs.  It took me several years to get where I really wanted to go but in the mean time I made money, learned a lot of new job skills, and got to travel for free and see the world on company dime.

UniversityOfHouston,2otweu,MulderFoxx,1 point,Wed Dec 10 04:27:02 2014 UTC,That OK. Caveman no watch that game anyway.
UniversityOfHouston,2oq987,SometimesY,15,Tue Dec 9 05:50:18 2014 UTC,"Please no. We already experimented with one special teams coach and McGaughey hardly has a stellar background. If the UH higher-ups know what is good for the university, they will not hire him. We need a relatively high profile hire. The vacuum that Briles, Sumlin and Keenum left have really hurt us. We lost all of the really good momentum we had."
UniversityOfHouston,2oq987,Pathis,2,Tue Dec 9 05:54:02 2014 UTC,I concur. We really need a HC with a short learning curve. I'm a little concerned that Levine's buyout will keep us from offering a salary that will be attractive to most of the coaches that we would want.
UniversityOfHouston,2oq987,Pathis,2,Tue Dec 9 18:57:38 2014 UTC,"I'm worried about that as well. I think that if we don't pick up a really good HC, we're going to be perpetually doomed to mediocrity. There is likely another round of realignment coming in the next year or two and if we don't have a good bit of success (as in 9/10 win seasons), we'll never join a P5 conference. However the sunk cost really hurts us. I'm not sure why the hell we even extended his contract that long."
UniversityOfHouston,2oq987,Obnoxious_liberal,1 point,Tue Dec 9 19:13:24 2014 UTC,I have heard that the extension logic went that recruits are hesitant to sign with a coach that the university does not have faith in. A contract until 2018 allowed UH to use Levine's potential longevity as a recruiting tool. Why UH didn't have a less costly out to fire him before then will surely be a talking point between Rhodes and Khator.
UniversityOfHouston,2oq987,Alaska13,3,Tue Dec 9 23:37:59 2014 UTC,Rhett Lashlee from Auburn is still my favorite choice.  That offense is fun to watch.
UniversityOfHouston,2oq987,calculatemyluck,2,Wed Dec 10 01:19:38 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I both hope and think it's most feasible that Doug Meacham comes back from TCU to be HC. He knows this team, the guys know him, his offense was good when he was here, and if he would call plays and we can keep Gibbs on at DC, I think we will get better. We really need to improve and win 10 games each season from here on in order to be seriously considered for a jump to a P5 conference, possibly the Big 12."
UniversityOfHouston,2oq987,calculatemyluck,1 point,Wed Dec 10 23:04:06 2014 UTC,What about Jim Harbaugh? He could be released next year.
UniversityOfHouston,2oq987,Jopgo,2,Tue Dec 9 21:10:04 2014 UTC,No offense but there's no way he would come here. There's plenty of NFL jobs who want him and Michigan plus we don't have the money
UniversityOfHouston,2oq987,TheVictoryHat,2,Tue Dec 9 21:11:02 2014 UTC,Yep. It would be a massive step down for him (from a very successful P5 school to the NFL to a struggling G5 school) and we wouldn't be able to afford the cost of hiring him.

UniversityOfHouston,2oo8qq,jas_lit,1 point,Mon Dec 8 19:18:43 2014 UTC,"Dear Cougs,  Thanks for indulging a little shameless self-promotion. I'm writing to announce that I will be offering an online graduate-level English seminar called ""Chuck Palahniuk in Context"" in the spring 2015 semester. In the course, we will read Chuck Palahniuk's work in relation to literary criticism and other writers' works. Graduate courses on single authors are rare, and this is one of the first offered that is focused on Palahniuk's literature.  English 6300 (Section 25051) will be offered in spring semester 2015 and enrollment is limited. The course is offered through the University of Houston-Victoria, where I'm an Assistant Professor of English. I'm the author of several interviews with Palahniuk, as well as the editor of Sacred and Immoral: On the Writings of Chuck Palahniuk (2009).  Of Chuck's works, everyone will read Fight Club, Diary, Rant, Stranger than Fiction. We will also watch the Fight Club film adaptation (for which I have recorded a downloadable professor's commentary), as well as the first issue of the Fight Club 2 graphic novel when it gets released in April. Each student will also be individually responsible for reading two more Palahniuk books, selected in discussion with the professor to aid the themes of their research paper. The Palahniuk readings will be supplemented with criticism, literary history, related authors' works, and my notes and lectures. Students will participate in the course through discussion boards and will complete a graduate research paper on an aspect of Palahniuk's literature.  The online nature of this seminar means that you can take the course from anywhere in the world, and you do not have to pursue a graduate degree at UHV. These are graduate course hours at fully-accredited campus of the University of Houston, so they can potentially transfer to anyone's home institution. If you have an undergraduate degree (BA, BS, etc), you can register with UHV as a ""Temporary Graduate Student"" who can take up to 12 graduate hours at UHV without declaring a degree program. To apply, follow the link and find the heading marked ""Temporary Graduate"" about 2/3 of the way down the page. You'll need to use the application form and provide a transcript (just like any grad school), but the process will be quick and relatively painless because you're not applying to a specific program. You can use UHV's Tuition and Fees calculator to figure out how much it would cost for you to take the course.  Thanks again for your interest in studying Palahniuk's work with the level of scholarly attention it deserves. I look forward to talking with you soon.  Jeff"

UniversityOfHouston,2oks6p,ArnoldPalmerLover,9,Sun Dec 7 20:16:02 2014 UTC,"I really hope the Mike Leach rumor has some legs to it.   Our program needs a distinguishing feature, because to be brutally honest we are largely irrelevant to the world of college football. Mike Leach changes that by not only returning us to our aerial assault offensive roots (exciting to think about incoming QB Ben Hicks or John O'Korn potentially turning his act around under the tutelage of an offensive genius) but by giving our team his crazy pirate swagger. Leach's attitude would mesh incredibly well with our third ward D, and he already knows how to recruit our talent rich state.   He would electrify our stagnant program, hopefully taking care of the apathetic fans and attendance issue we've got simultaneously.  Regardless of who we hire (unfortunately Mike Leach is a little optimistically unreasonable), as long we retain Gibbs as our D coordinator, and replace Levine with a legitimate offensive mind, our team is gonna be great next season."
UniversityOfHouston,2oks6p,itsnotchucktesta,4,Mon Dec 8 08:24:38 2014 UTC,There were lots of fans from rival Texas schools (like UT and A&M) saying they would love to watch UH games (in addition to their own teams) if Leach came.
UniversityOfHouston,2oks6p,ShaolinMaster,5,Mon Dec 8 16:54:26 2014 UTC,Great.  How much is this going to cost us?
UniversityOfHouston,2oks6p,MulderFoxx,4,Mon Dec 8 07:48:39 2014 UTC,"This will be better for us in the long run, since most of our fan base are fair-weather fans, attendance at the last few home games was abysmal. We are not going to go anywhere with bad coaching"
UniversityOfHouston,2oks6p,midsprat123,1 point,Mon Dec 8 13:47:02 2014 UTC,"Absolutely right. This is really a discussion about return on investment. The real question is how much, if any, are we prepared to pay up for a quality replacement. A return is SURE to come but who we hire is sure to affect what it is."
UniversityOfHouston,2oks6p,Pathis,1 point,Tue Dec 9 23:46:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah, we probably lost a lot of revenue by losing all of that fan support during the losses.  It's probably cheaper to make a coaching change."

I graduated back in May 2014 and I found it sufficient enough for Renu Khator to make a speech, I even remember most of her speech. I think walking across the stage is a big deal for University of Houston students cause unlike other big name Universities, UH students tend to be the first ones in their families to graduate. Which in my opinion makes it a big deal to walk across the stage."

I've been here for 9 fucking years, and I have damn well earned the right to walk. I've been at this univeristy for longer than Khator has, and have seen dozens of friends graudate, and EVERY ONE OF THEM got to walk. Plus my parents, who live on the other side of the planet have already booked their flight and hotel to come into town to watch me graduate. If that is taken away, the university will be losing one wealthy and otherwise very loyal future donor. I will turn my back on this school for the rest of my life if that is taken away from me and my parents after all of the time and energy I have put in here.  As far as a big name speaker: WHO GIVES A FUCK? If we wanted to listen to big name people speak, we could go to any of several dozen lectures given around the city every year by people WAY bigger than our university could ever draw.  tl;dr:  -No.  -Yes.  -Yes to the point of cutting all ties with the university after I graduate."

UniversityOfHouston,2nv6wj,yakovgolyadkin,-3,Sat Dec 6 01:08:20 2014 UTC,Stop doing drugs! Isn't your career more important?
UniversityOfHouston,2nv6wj,caedin8,7,Mon Dec 1 15:11:31 2014 UTC,You must be fun at parties. What career? He's asking about work-study.
UniversityOfHouston,2nv6wj,yakovgolyadkin,-5,Mon Dec 1 16:10:10 2014 UTC,"Work-study is the first part of your career, is it not? Shouldn't your work-study be in the field you want to eventually go into? It will help you get a great starting job out of college if you have relevant experience."
UniversityOfHouston,2nv6wj,tex045,4,Mon Dec 1 16:13:22 2014 UTC,"Not really, no. For most people, it's just a job in college that helps pay tuition. It can be part of financial aid."
UniversityOfHouston,2nv6wj,yakovgolyadkin,-2,Mon Dec 1 16:20:09 2014 UTC,Even more reason to stay clean! Why pay someone to go to school and do drugs?
UniversityOfHouston,2nv6wj,yakovgolyadkin,1 point,Mon Dec 1 16:51:00 2014 UTC,"They aren't. They are getting paid for the work they do, and they are only eligible for financial aid if they continue to perform academically, so clearly they are still going to school. What does what they do in their personal time matter to you at all?"
UniversityOfHouston,2nv6wj,tex045,1 point,Mon Dec 1 17:22:30 2014 UTC,They are paying for their own school. By working. That's the point.
UniversityOfHouston,2nv6wj,yakovgolyadkin,-4,Thu Jan 22 04:49:32 2015 UTC,"What they do in their spare time doesnt matter to me at all. My comment was in response to your ""it can be part of financial aid"" remark - If they are getting paid to participate, they should be drug-free. Work-study programs are part of the FEDERAL Work Study Program and in my opinion, anyone receiving financial aid from the government should be drug free just like food stamps or welfare"
UniversityOfHouston,2nv6wj,tex045,5,Thu Jan 22 05:58:32 2015 UTC,"You do understand that there is a big difference between a work-study program and food stamps, right? Work-study is not a welfare program. It's a job. The payment they are getting to participate is for the work they do at their job."

UniversityOfHouston,2ntehe,STATSKID,1 point,Sun Nov 30 04:55:33 2014 UTC,Yes I will be a freshman. Thing is my dad doesn't want me to go to a community college. He thinks it'll worsen my education. I live in SA btw.
UniversityOfHouston,2ntehe,MulderFoxx,8,Sun Nov 30 06:13:51 2014 UTC,"You're dad is mistaken.  With all due respect,  you can tell him that I have worked in higher education for 15 years and students who go to community college first, take the right things and are successful often do better than those who just go to the 4 year because their parents forced them to.   That being said,  I work at UH and I would recommend UTSA over UH Victoria. The UH system schools are all different,  just like UT system schools,  they just happen to all be around the same area.   Lastly, I went UH my freshman year and I wasn't ready. After 3 poor semesters,  I went to a community college, then went to a 4 year, graduated and went on in my education from there."
UniversityOfHouston,2ntehe,ThursdayAddams,5,Sun Nov 30 19:13:52 2014 UTC,"students who go to community college first, take the right things and are successful often do better than those who just go to the 4 year because their parents forced them to.   I think the biggest risk with going to cc though is that the classes there are usually always easier than those at 4 year schools. You really need to be making A's at cc to do well at UH, especially if you're premed."

UniversityOfHouston,2ntehe,STATSKID,4,Thu Dec 4 03:34:49 2014 UTC,Honestly there is nothing wrong with going to CC. At CC I've actually seen a few teachers care more about helping students that actual college. So you might have to somehow explain to your dad that community college doesn't mean you're getting a lower tier education. You'll just have to do really well in CC in order to transfer to UH. What major are you planning for?
UniversityOfHouston,2ntehe,DreadPiratesRobert,1 point,Mon Dec 1 04:09:25 2014 UTC,"Yep I understand. My sister went to a CC and it messed her up from there. She's about to graduate at a four-year in her bio degree, but with a not so good GPA. My dad thinks that CC made her do poorly, but I think otherwise.  Something I do think CC is, however, is that you're actually paying more to go to highschool again.  I plan on majoring in either Psychology or Biology and doing the pre-med route. I'm leaning more towards psych since I have an awesome interest in it, and bio seems like it would rip my gpa a new one."
UniversityOfHouston,2ntehe,DreadPiratesRobert,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:51:09 2014 UTC,"Something I do think CC is, however, is that you're actually paying more to go to highschool again.   I don't know what you mean by this. You can take the same core courses at CC and then transfer it to UH, and it'll hold the same value. Your diploma will say UH and will have no mention of the fact that you went to CC."
UniversityOfHouston,2ntehe,RoyalVelvet,3,Thu Dec 4 17:41:06 2014 UTC,"In my personal opinion it's better to go to a main campus like Texas State or Texas Tech. If UH main campus is your end goal, I'd suggest community college and work your ass off. As far as your dad's concerns, look up how good your community college is. I know ACC has harder math programs than most Texas state schools."
UniversityOfHouston,2ntehe,Takeme2yourleader,2,Sun Nov 30 14:05:03 2014 UTC,"Applied to tech.. Got dozens of emails from them, even asked their subreddit if I would get accepted and like 20 people said yes, but I didn't lol. It's too far nonetheless.   I heard txstate was a bigger party school than any in Texas and didn't apply."

UniversityOfHouston,2ntehe,Takeme2yourleader,7,Sun Nov 30 17:34:58 2014 UTC,"No. Just no.  You're in SA, have you applied to UTSA or TXST? Neither of those sound like an STD. I don't know if UHV is curable."

UniversityOfHouston,2ntehe,soyesachica,3,Sun Nov 30 19:52:07 2014 UTC,"Well, not harder, at least. It's actually slightly easier to get into UTSA.  UTSA requirements. Need to be top 25% for guaranteed admission.  UH requirements. Need to be top 10% for guaranteed admission."

It's a sorry excuse for college but aside from falling in love with the diversity and clubs at UH, as well as the pride, I also want to get away from home.   Uhv is nothing like UH but it has an interesting university. It has like 12 clubs though and is small..."

The other schools mentioned are certainly good as well, I don't want to discount them; all of them are great choices.  If you're thinking pre-med, remember that you need AWESOME grades in your undergrad.  Wherever you go, make sure you have the support you need to make that happen.  You might consider a specific pre-med bachelor program that would get you there; maybe go into a community college system that feeds into it.  Keep things cheap and attainable. You have a long climb, and every rung on that ladder should be calculated with an understanding of where you'll be putting the next foot.  Good luck, and keep asking questions.  You're already asking good ones."

UniversityOfHouston,2mtgc2,QuattroStig,1 point,Thu Nov 20 00:28:31 2014 UTC,"Agreed with double majoring, but starting wage as a measurement of success is pretty irrelevant. While hard to measure, the highest mean salary would be a much better indicator of financial freedom."
UniversityOfHouston,2mtgc2,caedin8,-4,Thu Nov 20 19:34:33 2014 UTC,"As a STEM major at UH I am going to go out on a limb and say don't waste your time getting double majors in business degrees, focus on getting really good technical skills (programming) and you will ace your interviews and land a 70k+ job easy. I am a CS major and had a few of these offers, but of the MIS people I interviewed alongside, only the ones with decent technical skills got offers."
UniversityOfHouston,2mtgc2,caedin8,7,Thu Nov 20 01:16:37 2014 UTC,As a STEM major    Of course
UniversityOfHouston,2mtgc2,Platinumized,2,Thu Nov 20 02:59:53 2014 UTC,"I have bias and of course acknowledge it, but I think my points are valid: The better your technical abilities, the higher your starting salary."
UniversityOfHouston,2mtgc2,Takeme2yourleader,1 point,Thu Nov 20 03:24:22 2014 UTC,"All my friends that I knew personally with MIS degrees all landed 70k+ jobs with ease, but maybe they were more technically acceptable. But mixing it with SCM is a huge plus."
UniversityOfHouston,2mtgc2,caedin8,-1,Thu Nov 20 01:33:47 2014 UTC,Bullshit. I know plenty of individuals who majored in MIS nad SCM and got 65k starting with a 10k bonus sign on. Caedin8 doesnt know what hes talking about
UniversityOfHouston,2mtgc2,Platinumized,1 point,Thu Nov 20 01:50:58 2014 UTC,"Many of the software consulting companies hire evenly software engineers and MIS graduates, call them all consultants and give them all the same starting salary of 70k + signing bonus. The caveat is that you really need a specialty in one side with a general knowledge of the other. For example, CS major that are nerdy, not very presentable, and lack business knowledge won't get offers. On the other hand, bright MIS students who can't figure out how to write code or use a technology stack won't get offers either. These jobs have coding as part of the interview, and a large portion of the MIS applicants get weeded out because they fail the coding portion.  Typically if you take a spectrum, from more business skills to more technical skills, the more technical your specialty the higher your salary. Good software engineers make 95k+ out of college. If you diversify your skill sets across many business fields but have sub-optimal technical skills you may find yourself only able to get a 50-60k job as a MIS major.  So to refine my point, I recommend only pursing a second business degree IF you are very talented with technology, if not, you will get better return by focusing on being the best programmer in your classes. You can get by doing both, but you lose specialization which helps get you more money."
UniversityOfHouston,2mtgc2,Robbyc13,0,Thu Nov 20 03:28:25 2014 UTC,I might consider going to UH for MIS cuz I do not what to go to Austin its too dame expensive... Is it worth studying in collage station (A&M) Austin (UT) or go to UH.
UniversityOfHouston,2mtgc2,caedin8,3,Thu Nov 20 03:01:04 2014 UTC,"Honestly, UT isn't much more expensive than UH. They have a better corporate relationship and more relationships with Fortune 500 companies to work for.   And it depends on what kind of college experience you want.

But, I know Parks very well, he's the guy to know if you are interested in MIS. I would say Bauer is a great place for an MIS degree. I've noticed you've asked a lot about whether UH is worth it versus A&M and UT. In my opinion, it is, but your mileage may vary. I love the focused nature of everyone here, but I also live on campus which means I have tons of party friends too. UH is the kind of place where you need to make your own entertainment, whether that be going to get wasted at the frat's, going for a late night House of Pies run, or going to see a movie in the lounge. But in my opinion UH is the best move I've made. I already have an internship lined up, as a sophomore, as well as great connections with multiple Accounting firms and Industry companies. So in my opinion, its the best option."

If your application says TECH undergraduate that means that is what you are for now. Once you start classes file a petition to get into mechanical engineering. There a few requirements such as GPA and a couple of pre requisite classes. Email one of the mechanical engineering advisers or secretaries for more information.

I know the Keeland center is open to non-architecture students (I use the laser cutter there frequently) but orientations take place at the semester's start.  Your best bet is to go off campus to one of the makerspaces, TXRX is pretty close and offers wood working classes and woodshop access at reasonable rates.  There is a student makerspace as well, Rust House, but it doesn't have much in the way of woodworking unless you just need something cnc routed."
UniversityOfHouston,2m57nk,wespor,4,Thu Nov 13 04:15:26 2014 UTC,"This is partially incorrect. The Keeland Center is not officially open to non-architecture students although there are some exceptions. These exceptions include students from a particular engineering course and students from a particular graphic design course, both of which the professors contacted, and made an agreement with, the Keeland Supervisors. Any other instances of students who have access and are not part of those two groups were just lucky flukes/oversights. OP will most likely be disappointed if he/she comes to the Keeland Center."

If you're coming in with upper level math and some other engineering courses already out of the way possibly. I was hoping I could do the same. Unfortunately a lot of the classes are offered only fall or spring once you get into upper level and chances are it will probably take longer, I'm speaking with regards to a different program at UH, chemical might be different, if you're classes are offered more often then it is a possibility. Talk to your advisor and look over your degree plan, that will give you a good idea if its possible. Use the course registration software to look at fall and spring semesters to see which classes are offered when, though that is subject to change.  Be reminded that the engineering courseload isn't a joke and trying to cram it in might be ill-advised.  Also, I'm getting my second bachelors at 26, UH in general is home to lots of not-traditional students. If you're willing to put yourself out there it shouldn't be a problem getting a long with your classmates."

UniversityOfHouston,2lj48m,ForrestFireDW,1 point,Fri Nov 7 04:10:06 2014 UTC,It should be in the previous broadcasts. I'm on mobile so I cant see it.
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,Guavaberry27,3,Thu Nov 6 07:23:09 2014 UTC,"The online version of GEOL 1340 - Earth Systems. There are several tests and nothing else, and all of them are multiple choice. What makes it easy is that 90% of the questions on the test are verbatim from the practice questions. Just cover those, go to CASA and take the 5-10 minutes on the exams, repeat 5 times, and walk out with an A. I spent a combined total of less than 3 hours the entire semester, between the practice exams, driving to campus, and taking the exams, and got an A- in the class."
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,yakovgolyadkin,2,Fri Nov 7 16:31:01 2014 UTC,"Take it with Lytwyn, she may be a little dry when it comes to lectures, but her exams are STUPID easy, just memorize the key words on her slides and you'll make an A"
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,ideadcellz,2,Fri Nov 7 17:28:03 2014 UTC,"But with the online one, you never even have to spend the time going to class."
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,yakovgolyadkin,1 point,Fri Nov 7 17:55:28 2014 UTC,"For some reason, some of her ratemyprofessors reviews rate her as having tough exams."
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,yakovgolyadkin,1 point,Mon Nov 10 15:30:23 2014 UTC,What professor did you take the online one with?
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,yakovgolyadkin,2,Fri Nov 7 18:32:35 2014 UTC,Lytwyn.
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,yakovgolyadkin,1 point,Fri Nov 7 18:43:12 2014 UTC,"I might enroll in that one, but for some reason some of her ratemyprofessors reviews say that it's a hard class to take online and that her tests are tough."
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,ideadcellz,2,Mon Nov 10 15:31:11 2014 UTC,"I took the class back in 2011, so she may have changed it since then and made it tougher."
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,ElHombrePajaro,1 point,Mon Nov 10 15:32:24 2014 UTC,"Ah. That would make some sense, still thanks for the suggestion. Any other easy electives that come to your mind?  (Also, I forgot to not be super creepy, I'm the venezuelan girl from the intro to anth with avery over this summer)"
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,yakovgolyadkin,1 point,Mon Nov 10 15:45:59 2014 UTC,"Over the winter mini semester there is an online class with Prof. Buzzanco. HIST 3349 - War, Globalization, and Terrorism. It's all Youtube videos and he told me that it's just a single assignment he gives at the beginning of the semester and it's due at the end. I'm not sure if winter semester classes count towards spring hours, though.  You weren't creepy at all. Why would you think you were?"
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,_kittentits,1 point,Mon Nov 10 16:26:16 2014 UTC,"Her class and/or teaching style is not hard at all. I took her Physical Geology class during the summer, and it was very very very easy. Thats why I recommend her"
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,1vh1,3,Mon Nov 10 18:12:41 2014 UTC,ANTH 2302
UniversityOfHouston,2lgdaj,1vh1,3,Sat Nov 8 01:58:47 2014 UTC,"Definitely agree with this. It's not that it's necessarily a super easy class, it's just an incredibly interesting class, and the two professors who offer it, Fernandez and Avery, are both fantastic."
UniversityOfHouston,2lf09n,UofHBondage,15,Wed Nov 5 23:09:46 2014 UTC,u gotta be a lil masochistic to go to UH. i say go for it
UniversityOfHouston,2lf09n,shaggytits,5,Thu Nov 6 11:03:34 2014 UTC,Fetlife UH? Says my room mate when I shared this post with him.....
UniversityOfHouston,2lf09n,Saladtoes,3,Thu Nov 6 01:03:38 2014 UTC,that group is dead. Highly recommend checking out BIGHT. Bondage in Greater Houston Texas is a new group I have started that seems to have one of the youngest groups in Houston. It focuses on rope bondage. https://fetlife.com/groups/100629
UniversityOfHouston,2lf09n,knot2nice,1 point,Thu Nov 6 13:53:38 2014 UTC,"What do you guys usually do for meetings? Any sponsorship needed or membership costs? I've been interested in joining but my partner lives hours away making it difficult to make meetings, not to mention being fairly new to rope in general."
UniversityOfHouston,2lf09n,ForrestFireDW,1 point,Thu Nov 6 18:41:23 2014 UTC,"right now we have munches once a week where you can just eat some food and meet some awesome people, but we have started throwing larger events. We just had gorgone in town to teach a 2 day intensive....google her if you dont know her. AMAZING!  I am going to teach a cheap 2 day intensive soon to get newbies all the way from single column ties to legit suspensions in two days.  we throw parties and open rope days every now and then and are looking for input on what people like you want.  there is no membership fee currently although some of the events do cost money....well because they cost me money :)  most events dont need sponsorship but that will change soon once we get more members  message me for more info"
UniversityOfHouston,2lf09n,knot2nice,5,Fri Nov 7 13:56:29 2014 UTC,"Nothing UH only, but Houston is a large area. Mostly HEAT meetings or kiddie pool meetings. Everything is on Fetlife. So if you aren't on Fetlife you are missing out. If you are on FL then check out the kiddie pool https://fetlife.com/groups/15993"
UniversityOfHouston,2lf09n,ForrestFireDW,3,Thu Nov 6 08:28:42 2014 UTC,I don't know but I'm curious to how the meetings go.
UniversityOfHouston,2lf09n,DecodedFromSpace,29,Wed Nov 5 23:12:44 2014 UTC,They usually don't meet because everyone's a bit tied up.
UniversityOfHouston,2lf09n,midsprat123,5,Wed Nov 5 23:47:50 2014 UTC,Ba dum crack
UniversityOfHouston,2lf09n,knot2nice,-1,Wed Nov 5 23:52:49 2014 UTC,I would imagine they are a mouthful
UniversityOfHouston,2leymy,midsprat123,4,Wed Nov 5 22:56:40 2014 UTC,As far as I know they've always closed at 3:30 M-TH and 2:00 on F..
UniversityOfHouston,2leymy,SleepyAsian,3,Thu Nov 6 06:07:50 2014 UTC,most of the employees are exactly friendly   Wha? I've never had a bad experience with the employees at that Pizza Hut.
UniversityOfHouston,2leymy,Chancelloriate,1 point,Thu Nov 6 16:41:42 2014 UTC,"not saying they are bad, but you can tell they are not happy, almost no eye contact, etc ..."
UniversityOfHouston,2leymy,Hoten,1 point,Thu Nov 6 21:47:08 2014 UTC,Their bread sticks are always under cooked and looked like they were made in a hurry.
UniversityOfHouston,2leymy,Tikikala,1 point,Fri Nov 7 03:07:13 2014 UTC,"https://order.pizzahut.com/site/contact_us  Address your concerns to corporate, perhaps something can be fixed."
