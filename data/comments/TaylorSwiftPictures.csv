Her stylist owes her a major apology."
TaylorSwiftPictures,2ehmzm,littlemisfit,1 point,Mon Aug 25 22:32:50 2014 UTC,At first I was gonna disagree with you that it's no too tacky but yeah she is trying to hard to be sexy it's better than the high waisted bikinis we have seen her wear in the past!! http://imgur.com/7PzSKgM  but she has done better in the past to look hot and show off her sexy legs...she looks hotter when she tries less than what she tried at the VMAs http://imgur.com/a/vp2yB

TaylorSwiftPictures,27ymar,Whale_Bait,2,Fri Jun 13 00:18:18 2014 UTC,Maybe the tights that she usually wears we're tearing on the bottom from being constantly in direct contact with the ground and the ballet shoes were to prevent it? That's my thoughts anyways.

TaylorSwiftPictures,1t6zp4,HomicideSS,3,Thu Dec 19 05:06:37 2013 UTC,"You're not the only one. I think she looks more like an attractive woman than a cure girl with straight hair. Not that there's anything wrong with a cute girl, I just enjoy the more adult look of the straight hair more."

TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,DragonStar_RS,1 point,Sun Dec 1 19:04:32 2013 UTC,Totally agree
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,AceMeepsm,1 point,Sun Dec 1 19:47:45 2013 UTC,"That's because models don't eat.  Also, not to be mean, but that Angel's eyes look really far apart, but it might just be the angle."
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,Daithe,3,Sun Dec 1 19:47:24 2013 UTC,I don't know about the foods thing but I agree with you with the eyes thing.
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,AceMeepsm,1 point,Sun Dec 1 19:54:51 2013 UTC,It's a common thing for models to be anorexic or bulimic.
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,Daithe,1 point,Sun Dec 1 19:58:04 2013 UTC,Yea but I thought they were supposed to look pretty/sexy. And I saw the runway show and I don't see how Taylor is fatter or not as in shape and she is still more normal than the Angels
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,AceMeepsm,1 point,Sun Dec 1 20:19:49 2013 UTC,"Runway models don't need to be conventionally pretty - they need to be a thin rack for displaying clothes for, a face that you can do things to with make-up and get a striking result."
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,PanGalacGargleBlastr,1 point,Mon Dec 2 00:07:18 2013 UTC,"Agree, but I would think that conventional pretty would appeal to more people.  Edit: added sentence after agree"

TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,Daithe,1 point,Sun Dec 1 21:25:36 2013 UTC,"I think she's one of the most beautiful women I know of (second to Ariane). I just don't think she's a very good example of someone who's ""bigger"" than a model."
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,Daithe,1 point,Sun Dec 1 21:28:48 2013 UTC,I don't think anyone made a comment about Taylor being bigger than a model.
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,AceMeepsm,1 point,Sun Dec 1 21:31:08 2013 UTC,"Original comment:   Taylor looks ALOT better compared to that VS ""Angel"" IMO.   Your reply:   That's because models don't eat.   You might not have said it directly but you definitely implied it."
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,Imma_Knight,2,Sun Dec 1 21:33:37 2013 UTC,"I didn't mean for it to sound like that.  Some models don't eat, or eat very little, and they get a different body shapes than people who eat a normal amount.  I didn't mean to imply that Taylor is bigger, her body just isn't the same shape."
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,Imma_Knight,1 point,Sun Dec 1 21:38:58 2013 UTC,I think Taylor is gorgeous to. You wouldn't describe her as abnormal or skinny as a pencil. Some models are. Taylor just has an amazing body and her face is flawless and the straight hair is sexy.
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,AceMeepsm,1 point,Mon Dec 2 05:40:36 2013 UTC,"Models eat, they are just really healthy."
TaylorSwiftPictures,1rufbb,AceMeepsm,1 point,Sun Dec 1 20:27:46 2013 UTC,"While I agree, it is also about how well they can fill a bra."

TaylorSwiftPictures,1ruh37,voyager2000,2,Sun Dec 1 17:14:01 2013 UTC,Any chance of a higher res version of that last one? Would make a really nice desktop background if it was bigger.
TaylorSwiftPictures,1ruh37,Isemados,1 point,Sun Dec 1 23:24:44 2013 UTC,Apreciate the effort but this looks to be a resized version of the one in the album as opposed to an original higher res version. As such massive pixelation so it won't really do as a desktop (at least not for me).
TaylorSwiftPictures,1ro6nt,mrexcon,6,Thu Nov 28 22:06:16 2013 UTC,Does posting this make me a little pervy? Maybe... Probably... I don't care.

TaylorSwiftPictures,1q4bj8,DragonStar_RS,1 point,Sat Nov 9 10:07:16 2013 UTC,Any particular reason why? Just wondering.
TaylorSwiftPictures,1q4bj8,tiredofscreennames,3,Sat Nov 9 23:04:05 2013 UTC,"Again, before anyone gets wound up this is just my opinion.   I don't like it because it makes her look like some kind of fatuous blonde bimbo, who has dressed to look classy but with out any real understanding of what that entails.   The fact that Taylor normal carries off style and looking fantastic with such ease normally makes me wonder why they went down that path.  Again that is just IMHO. I'm sure other people like it and that's fine but I don't. I also don't believe Taylor will look back at them with any fondness."

Edit: I googled and found this abomination of 'journalism' from the Daily Fail   Country singer Taylor Swift has been forced to defend claims she is a racist after being photographed with her arm around a man wearing a swastika on his T-shirt.  The situation was made worse by the fact Taylor was wearing the initials 'JH' - which often stands for 'Jew Hater' - on her own shirt.  However, the initials were later found to stand for friend Julianne Hough."

TaylorSwiftPictures,1lx9z7,kenbw2,5,Sun Sep 8 03:03:10 2013 UTC,She wanted to pursue her own musical career. She has a website with some songs on it. I like them. Really hoping she takes off one day.

TaylorSwiftPictures,1j2tug,Kingmilano,8,Fri Jul 26 04:34:53 2013 UTC,"I think that Taylor didn't even date some of the boys they all say she did. I think it was something like Taylor hung out with a guy friend, maybe held his hand because she's touchy (I've held guy friends hands before). Since she makes lots of break up songs the media decided to give her that image, since every star ""has to have a label"". I don't know, I don't really believe the majority of what rags say about these young girls."

Until I'm one of them, hopefully the last (Hey, let a guy dream), I don't really care who Taylor has or hasn't dated."
