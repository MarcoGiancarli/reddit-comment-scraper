Frasier,3e5zvd,screaming_ot_inside,7,Wed Jul 22 05:38:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's very nice. It's no mansion, but for a city center condo, it's very nice and has a great view which is rare and drives up the price. Take a look at the cost of something in a major city on around the 19th floor with a close view of the major skyline buildings and the same square footage. It isn't cheap at all. (City + Specific Location + Story Number + View + Size.) Plus, the main living space is what people react to -- it's a good size and, more importantly, very well designed and adorned with a wide variety of pieces Frasier chose (""It's eclectic."" -- ""You know, an objet here, an antique there"".) Look into the work that went into designing the set. I believe there's at least one good article on it which I recall reading. Additionally, the people gasping are likely not used to anything that nice. I've seen some wild places on the internet, but recall this show was shot before it became very widespread...at least people browsing high-end properties wasn't, especially in the early season. Plus, it's a nice thing to compliment someone's living space on arrival. It's certainly no hole in the wall.  TL;DR - I disagree. I would like to replicate it and live in it."
Frasier,3e5zvd,K3R3G3,3,Wed Jul 22 05:53:22 2015 UTC,"I commented just yesterday when watching about how much I love his place. Frasier and Martin share one hallway, each of their rooms seem large and I think they have their own en suites.   You have Daphne's side which might I say looks huge so she's lucky. The kitchen is a decent size, the middle island with the oven is a great space saver.   Then there is the rather large living room and dining area which comfortably fits a party of guests. I think it's a cosy, stylish apartment that I would kill to have.   The only change I would make is where the bathroom is at the front door, it's to out in the open in regards to the living room. I'd make that a closet and have the bathroom over near Daphne's room."
Frasier,3e5zvd,Sproose_Moose,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:09:03 2015 UTC,"It is a quite large luxury apartment with an impossibly nice view, I think that's enough to impress his snobby friends.  Not to mention all his African knick knacks."
Frasier,3e1ogf,Sproose_Moose,8,Tue Jul 21 07:22:22 2015 UTC,"Claire is such a contrived character too.  I mean the whole ""perfect"" woman thing is a bit much."
Frasier,3e1ogf,Twiggy3,2,Tue Jul 21 11:16:35 2015 UTC,When she spoke in haiku that was very contrived and made her look like a pretentious weirdo to me.
Frasier,3e1ogf,Huginkyss,8,Wed Jul 22 05:48:04 2015 UTC,Is this why Frasier  broke up with her?  Too much residual  hurt from the party? If so it makes me feel better about him ruining it with her.
Frasier,3e1ogf,Twiggy3,2,Tue Jul 21 10:31:04 2015 UTC,He broke up with her because he was having feelings for Lana iirc he was having dreams about her when they holidayed in the Caribbean.
Frasier,3e1ogf,corbygray528,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:47:08 2015 UTC,"Well, he invented feelings for Lana to ruin things with Claire, because she was ""perfect"" and he was afraid of losing her, so he pushed her away."
Frasier,3e1ogf,droopyGT,3,Wed Jul 22 08:14:03 2015 UTC,"I literally watched this episode 3 minutes ago and thought the same thing. Like, he stopped flirting with you to go comfort the girl you forced him to bring here, because she is crying at her birthday party. This other douche is still trying to get you into his tiny plane to fly you to nappa valley to see a vineyard after you said you don't like riding in those planes."
Frasier,3dzvof,britneymisspelled,2,Mon Jul 20 21:44:54 2015 UTC,Did I miss it or did they gloss over the question of who is most like their character?
Frasier,3dzvof,corbygray528,2,Mon Jul 20 23:56:39 2015 UTC,I think they only asked 'least' like
Frasier,3dzvof,corbygray528,2,Tue Jul 21 03:17:54 2015 UTC,"I thought I heard most like/least like shoved into the same question, but I really don't remember now. I'll have to go check again.   edit: Yeah, he starts the question as ""Who is most like his or her character, and who is least like?"" at 2:58. Then John answers Peri as least like with some clips, and when it comes back they go to the bad sound cues clip segment."

Frasier,3dzvof,cherieblosum,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:43:06 2015 UTC,Brilliant cast and writers. This show stands the test of time!
Frasier,3e02zj,rapidretina,10,Mon Jul 20 22:39:24 2015 UTC,Can you give an example? I can't think of any time where they showed poor medical knowledge
Frasier,3e02zj,Stinktiere,5,Mon Jul 20 23:23:40 2015 UTC,"Of the top of my head: When Martin has a cardiac event he doesnt know what it is; he never says anything an MD would regarding any ailment, injury etc; the only time he back-seats drives is when Niles is having surgery, otherwise he never brings it up; etc. There are some better examples, but I can't remember right now.  For the most part he appears as knowledgeable in medicine as I am, and I have a degree in aeronautical engineering, not medicine.   Edit: Prominent examples include when the station had that doctor visiting and Frasier was completely clueless. He's also always telling Martin what to do but never brings in medical knowledge."
Frasier,3e02zj,Stinktiere,5,Tue Jul 21 03:08:11 2015 UTC,"He did know, he thought his dad was faking at first and then took him to hospital. Back seat driving during surgery - very Frasier. Visitng Doctor - I forget his name - but this seemed to me to show something very specific to Doctors - each wants to treat in their own specialism - a Psych wants to treat with psychiatry, a surgeon will want to cut you up, a medical doc will aim for medicine. Of course, the plot of that episode also required Frasier to be wrong."
Frasier,3e02zj,socrates_scrotum,3,Tue Jul 21 08:29:23 2015 UTC,They failed when asked to assist in delivering the taxi cab driver's baby.
Frasier,3e02zj,Stinktiere,6,Tue Jul 21 02:58:44 2015 UTC,"I put that one down to poor bedside manner though, they both tried,but annoyed the patient too much."
Frasier,3e02zj,Twiggy3,3,Tue Jul 21 08:25:45 2015 UTC,Niles only assisted in the delivery a baby once before!  and Frasier was just annoying.
Frasier,3e02zj,dachshundsocks,6,Tue Jul 21 11:20:35 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that, too.   Many years ago (when Frasier was actually getting its start) I volunteered in an emergency psychiatric center that was within a hospital ER. All I can say is that psychiatrists are just really different from any other doctors I've met. I mean, they are completely hands-off with patients. If something needed to be done with a patient, you grabbed a psych nurse. It's more intellectual, if you will. I suppose after years of psychiatric practice only the necessary knowledge is used. But I definitely get what you are saying. Some stuff is pretty basic."
Frasier,3e02zj,cherieblosum,7,Mon Jul 20 23:30:33 2015 UTC,Honestly they both seemed more like psychologists than psychiatrists.
Frasier,3e02zj,calciovita,3,Tue Jul 21 01:52:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like neither ever uses their medical skills, purely psychiatry stuff."
Frasier,3e02zj,cherieblosum,4,Tue Jul 21 03:09:59 2015 UTC,"Not even psychiatry stuff. They both talk about the theories of Freud and Jung, which psychiatrists don't care about. Neither of them seem to medicate their patients."
Frasier,3e02zj,calciovita,4,Tue Jul 21 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"That's a great point, they really never medicate their patients.  We do know that they have prescription pads (when Frasier mentioned Niles could write Daphne a prescription), but based on their conversations they never seem to mention medication."
Frasier,3e02zj,Twiggy3,4,Tue Jul 21 04:57:35 2015 UTC,"Niles mentions it when talking to Ralph   You know, Ralph, I was thinking that in many ways my profession is a lot like yours. I start out skimming the surface of the human psyche. Then I plunge ever deeper into the murky undercurrents, adding chemicals when necessary."
Frasier,3e02zj,kidmuaddib3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:19:14 2015 UTC,What if they both helped push the trend towards talk therapy and away from over-medication! Frasier solves all!
Frasier,3dyfhv,thevillagesteeple,14,Mon Jul 20 15:37:05 2015 UTC,"In the radio business a producer doesn't pay for anything, they book guests and run contests and kind of manage the show.  They work for the radio station and generally are less important than the talent, however they can definitely have an impact on the show."
Frasier,3dyfhv,setmehigh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:57 2015 UTC,I've heard the producer of my local drivetime radio show refer to the talent as her bosses a few times over the years
Frasier,3dyfhv,spinnaker989,4,Mon Jul 20 18:41:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i'm sure if the talent wanted a producer gone, and they had a decent sized following they would be gone.  Don and Mike went through a ton of them, and they are where most of my radio knowledge comes from."
Frasier,3dyfhv,setmehigh,5,Mon Jul 20 19:27:40 2015 UTC,She's the Robin to his Howard.
Frasier,3dyfhv,Sorryaboutthat1time,3,Mon Jul 20 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"She's the producer in the sense she produces the show! As you can see she runs the desk and selects the calls, plays the ads and probably would prompt him to think up new topics etc or tell him when the show was dull etc...  She is ultimately in charge of what goes out on air and in shaping the show, but as Frasier is the name talent he's the one people tune in for and thus it's 'his' show. She can be removed/re-tasked without an immediate drop in ratings; he can't.  It's a similar thing with TV and movie stars - writers or directors control the entire look and style of the show, decide what characters do and say and what scrapes they get into. But ultimately you as the viewer would notice and possibly stop watching if David Hyde Pierce left the show, would you if Joe Kenan stopped appearing in the credits? Big names have the audience pulling power, but the producer has the skills to show off the names talents best. It's technically a partnership, but the name is the harder to replace."
Frasier,3dw36l,britneymisspelled,11,Mon Jul 20 00:41:29 2015 UTC,"""I'll nuke it with some ketchup."" ""You can't use your turkey recipe on fish!"""
Frasier,3dw36l,joaj34,5,Mon Jul 20 01:45:32 2015 UTC,"Something I always notice when the subject of Niles and cooking comes up - sometimes, he is portrayed as a true gourmet in the kitchen (""Saucepans in summer, crepe pans in fall, when winter's upon us, there's food for us all!"") And other times, he's portrayed as a hopeless dolt (""I notice you're grating that carrot at a 45-degree angle. Does that enhance the flavour?"")  Just like with Frasier's on-again-off-again German, the show seems to grant Niles magical prowess in the kitchen when needed, and take it away again for the sake of a laugh."
Frasier,3dw36l,KellyAnne_Grunther,2,Mon Jul 20 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"Could it be that a lot of the dumb comments are just because he is trying to talk to daphne and is super nervous? Plus I think all TV shows do this, as the character grows, they have to play it a little fast and loose with the facts!"
Frasier,3dw36l,Lookmorecloselier,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"Well, certainly Niles is nervous around Daphne, but DHP doesn't play it as nervousness so much as incompetence. Niles even says, ""Now that I'm separated I need to learn to cook for myself,"" or something to that effect. This implies that he has almost no experience in the kitchen, which seems not to fit with his comments on subsequent occasions, eg, ""Flour the beef!"" and ""I've come dangerously close to over-braising my chard! It's almost as if something's dulled my motor skills!"" (Granted, the latter comment is from Season 11, so it's possible he's grown alot since his divorce from Maris... erughm... especially seeing as he ended up with Daphne, whose peanut brittle is like ""little shards of heaven."")   Perhaps I sound picky, and in a way I am being picky. But that doesn't mean that my intent is to criticize. It's more of an observation, I guess."
Frasier,3dw36l,KellyAnne_Grunther,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"""Now that I'm separated I need to learn to cook for myself,""   I see your point about the writers using his cooking only when it's convenient, but that line could be chalked up to him following through the cliches of separation. Like when he moves into the Shangri-La and wears Hawaiin shirts for a while because he's playing the part of someone who lives there to hide how sad he was that he was living there.  He also uses out of character comments for humour amongst friends, like saying things about needing to sell raffle tickets and a plan to unload them on some compulsive spenders. Obviously that's not something a respected psychiatrist who values his morals and honesty, so highly, would do.   Perhaps his character's sense of humour is based on pretending to be less uptight than he knows he is.  (probably just writers changing things without realising for a joke, but thought I'd offer another idea on why Niles makes out of character comments a lot.)"
Frasier,3dw36l,Mergan1989,2,Mon Jul 20 23:39:35 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's just one of those things that changes depending on what fits the plot. Similar to people outside Frasier's apartment door sometimes being able to hear what's going on, and sometimes not."

Frasier,3dg9i0,Mister_Po,3,Thu Jul 16 02:20:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Martin was definitely not bi.  As for this:   I know the show was aiming to address gay stereotypes   Um, says who? Nothing I have ever read or heard from the creators implies that. Certainly the show was sensitive to gays, but it almost exclusively used the traditional gay stereotype as a punch line on air. Out with Dad, Gill Chesterton, Patrick Stewart's episode, Bad Billy's, etc."
Frasier,3dg9i0,droopyGT,-6,Thu Jul 16 04:01:59 2015 UTC,"Um, says who? Nothing I have ever read or heard from the creators implies that.   Well you obviously missed this article then: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/26/david-hyde-pierce-frasier-gay-stereotypes-_n_7444176.html   ""The comedy, he noted, never included ""jokes at the expense of gay people,"" but rather acknowledged ""the preposterousness of stereotypes.""   Edit: Did anyone even read the article?"
Frasier,3dg9i0,droopyGT,6,Thu Jul 16 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase. Of course the stereotypes were presented as preposterous, but they (the stereotypes) were still the butt of many a joke on the show. It's exactly the same thing as saying the stereotypes presented of high income urban intellectuals was preposterous, because they did the same thing with them, playing them for laughs.  I said that the show was sensitive to gays, but saying that Frasier's ""aim"" was to address gay stereotypes isn't true like it is for say shows like Will and Grace or Modern Family.  Edit: An example. We see Martin's take on homosexuality shift around without any regard to character development. For instance, being completely homo-comfortable in Out With Dad to being completely homo-paranoid when Frasier helps Niles pick out a ring for Daphne. Contrast that with Jay on Modern Family who is a character designed to address gay stereotypes over his sitcom character arc."

Whole season 3 of MF was just meh. Season 1, 2, 5(,5) and 6 are good.  One of the main reasons, I think, is that MF has too many main characters. There are just too many I don't like.

Frasier,3d0343,FruityAndPrecocious,13,Sun Jul 12 10:14:04 2015 UTC,"Acting: All actors in this sitcom delivered their A game with perfect comedic timing. Chemistry: The friendship of the fictional characters had a true core due to the real friendship of the actors. Characters: The characters of Frasier were not just tokens to deliver punchlines, they were fully developed characteres with the whole range of emotions that were believable. They made you laugh but they also made you cry and think. Design: The show has a timeless design which allows it to stand the test of time. Writing: The writers rarely produced filler shows but always tried to bring the best story to the show and let the actors shine. They didnt fall back on cheap jokes but took the viewer seriously, they treated the audience with respect. This is very hard work that most shows fail after a short time. Humanism: The show was not superficial and cynical, but delivered a reflective, very observational view on the human condition, how conflicts between human beeings develop and how they can be resolved in a humanistic way. The characters behaviours were about facing the truth of a conflict and solve it by dealing with it, not supressing it."
Frasier,3d0343,Tele_Prompter,9,Sun Jul 12 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"Sitcoms tend to take a character flaw and really exaggerate it by the end of the show's run. Take Monica in Friends.

Frasier,3d0343,hattmorner,2,Sun Jul 12 15:46:01 2015 UTC,"Aside from the brilliant writing and comedic timing, I kind of relate to the relationship Frasier had with Martin.  My dad and I never had anything in common and it wasn't until later in life that we became really close, even though the love was always there.  It's kind of comforting to see that play out on this series."
Frasier,3d0343,razrhead,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"Casting and characters: To me this is the decisive factor that makes Frasier the best, to this day I haven't seen a TV show or film with better casting. The core cast lived their roles. Kelsey's technique of rehearsing just before the shooting, without memorizing his lines to the letter beforehand, with tons of improv. A very difficult technique for even the most seasoned of actors but it makes the performance so real and genuine. As far as I'm concerned, Kelsey Grammer was born to play Dr. Frasier Crane, same with the rest of the main cast and recurring characters, even the guest stars almost without exception. And I have to say it, Jane and Peri are super hot, which is always a plus.  Writing: Almost no fillers in a 11 year show, that's already a huge achievement in itself. Tons of references to earlier episodes (also to Cheers) and inside jokes, some aspects are criticized in the last seasons of course but different writers didn't try to change the characters to fit a particular story in their mind, something you see often in other long running shows, sadly. Instead, characters behaved and developed consistently and believably for 11 years.  And one last thing, the execs and writers were always mature enough to handle criticism, and improvise during times of crisis. Remember the episode with Niles as the lead, when Kelsey Grammer was absent for his therapy session? The plot was written for Frasier but it was handled so perfectly with minor touches, you hardly notice it. Daphne's brothers had unconvincing and distracting accents, some people even called it gibberish. So what did they do when they introduced another brother of hers in the finale? They made him speak incomprehensible gibberish. Niles and Frasier are criticized for the ""Freudian / Jungian"" trivialization of psychiatry, so Jen, young annoying cousin of Roz just points it out and mocks them. Then of course Frasier gets upset and spends most of his radio show praising Freud. What I'm trying to say is, the execs and writers were mature enough to take criticism and laugh at themselves, and even the glaring flaws of the show were turned into great selling points."

IMO, Kate wasn't the way to go. Don't get me wrong -- I liked her. (Wouldn't mind her climbing me like a scratching post.) But recall them exchanging interests and whatnot at the airport? They found a great deal of incompatibility. Like with Caitlin, they had a strong physical attraction/passion, but I think it mainly stopped there. Faye was an art-loving pastry chef of Le Cigare Volant! That's got destiny written all over it haha. And Claire was a Kierkergard reading, haiku writing, cellist/therapist! And the family loved her! And she and Daphne could've been sisters!"

Claire was perfect for him. Maybe a bit too perfect, forcing him to create the whole ""Lana or Claire"" dilemma in his mind.  Faye was also a good candidate but he was too insecure to tell him about Cassandra. Same deal with Kelly. Fras just had to take that photo to show off, he ruined everything (of course it wouldn't be a dealbreaker in Season 11).  I know Charlotte isn't a fan favorite, but after 11 years of heartache and failed romance, hooking Frasier up with a MATCHMAKER was a nice and smart resolution to the show. Besides, Frasier took the plane to be with her, and that's the main point. Once in his life he finally took the chance. It could be Claire, Faye, even Lilith instead of Charlotte."
Frasier,3ctmf6,Twiggy3,2,Sat Jul 11 09:31:46 2015 UTC,"Sure, there is the airport scene, but I'm team ""opposites attract"". With Kate there would've always been excitement.

Kinda makes you wonder if they had the 11 years somewhat planned out ahead of time a little."
Frasier,3ci24u,ilavayou,6,Wed Jul 8 05:02:19 2015 UTC,I think they were just comparing it to Cheers which went 11 seasons.
Frasier,3ci24u,Chris220,2,Wed Jul 8 06:41:01 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing. In fact, there's another video where he does the same thing several years later. I don't recall the specific numbers, but an example would be, after finishing season 8, he says 3 more would be good. Whatever it was, it equaled 11. Perhaps, that's what he felt they should do and pushed hard for it. Maybe everyone was willing to keep going and he felt 11 was the right stopping point. After all, they can't do the show without him and I'm sure he had more say than others like Daphne and Roz."

Frasier,3c6zgq,KidHauer,4,Sun Jul 5 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"The main thrust of the article is that Cheers ruined Frasier by showing that he and Lilith end up getting back together for good. They seem to be referring to a moment in the clip (which is supposed to occur in the far future) where the lawyer calls Frasier Lilith's ""husband.""  I would disagree. Multiple things from Cheers were retconned in Frasier and one is hardly cannon for the other. A single throwaway moment in one show does not automatically become precedent for the other. We're dealing with TV here, not constitutional law.  I for one don't believe that Frasier and Lilith ever get back together; she and Frasier have both moved on in their lives and are friends rather than lovers. Plus, she slept with Niles so there's that."
Frasier,3c6zgq,_sundry,3,Sun Jul 5 13:32:07 2015 UTC,"I agree. What's more, I wouldn't ever want Frasier and Lilith back together. I don't know how many people here are familiar with the Cheers years, but their marriage was unbearable. I mean, the characters themselves were highly entertaining, but they seemed always to bring out the absolute worst in one another. It got annoying. Spiteful bickering, childish outbursts, petty jealousy. And when Lilith wasn't around, all Frasier did was sit at the end of the bar and whine about how bad his marriage was.   It made me wonder why they get married in the first place. Oh, that's right. Frasier proposed to her merely as a desperate attempt to apologize for his misguided pursuit of Rebecca. And, by the way, he would have continued to pursue Rebecca had she displayed even the slightest bit of interest in him. The only reason Frasier returned to Lilith with a marriage proposal was out panic, of a sudden fear of being alone. How romantic! And how stupid it was for Lilith to accept, knowing the full circumstances. In my view, they both got what they deserved out of that marriage.   They had some good times, to be sure, but they were nothing compared to the massive dysfunction inherent to the union itself. I remember breathing a giant sigh of relief when Lilith departed for life in The Bubble.   The Frasier-Lilith dynamic was much improved in Frasier because they were no longer married. And Oh my God, was it ever nice not to have to hear those loathsome nicknames all the time. ""Cupcake... Sugarpants... Wild Asparagus... Parsnip... Marine Melon... Little Chopped Salad...""    Huh. Well, now that I type them out, they're actually kind of funny. I like the Salad one. But when Frasier said them on Cheers, I remember wanting to strangle him :/   Haha. I guess this turned into a rant. Sorry about that. I didn't even realize I felt that strongly about it. Huh. Well, my point is, the ""Frasier"" Frasier & Lilith was a million times better than the ""Cheers"" Frasier & Lilith. And I happily disregard any ""ending"" that would present them as being a couple again in the future."
Frasier,3c6zgq,Bromlife,2,Tue Jul 7 13:57:36 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that Flash forwards are what may be a possibility in the characters' futures, not a definite canon event. Often just from the imagination of one of the characters."
Frasier,3c6zgq,BluePhantom,5,Mon Jul 6 02:35:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, isn't ""Frasier"" one of the most successful spinoff series ever made?  Second, I don't think that article is right at all. The series finale of ""Frasier"", in my opinion, showed that Frasier had finally moved past all the parts of his personality that caused him to fail in relationships, and that he would be secure enough with himself that he would never feel the need to go back to Lilith. By the end of the last episode, I think we can assume he is ready to either be in a lasting relationship with Charlotte or handle rejection in a healthy way and move on to find happiness.  TL;DR:  The ending of ""Frasier"" strongly suggests the article is completely wrong."

Frasier,3c6oyr,daveroo,13,Sun Jul 5 10:23:33 2015 UTC,She had nothing to do with why Frasier left. And Hester had been gone at least 11 years and he dated throughout the entire series. You seem to just hate Ronnie even though she was not the first girlfriend Martin had on the show.
Frasier,3c6oyr,mrmerrbs,5,Sun Jul 5 13:13:27 2015 UTC,I really liked Ronee. She was a national treasure.
Frasier,3c6oyr,KellyAnne_Grunther,6,Sun Jul 5 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"Just onto the last series of frasier and i have to say martins relationship with ronee is just plain weird. firstly frasier liked her and martin didnt seem to care and suddenly out of character became competitive and uncaring for frasiers feelings.   Frasier and Martin have always been competitive but they still love each other. This also isn't the first time Martin stole a girl from Frasier. In season three he ends up dating Maureen; the policewoman who Frasier wants to ask out.   Also ronee as a character is a cliche. A ""sassy tough talking gal"". Terrible character.   Fraier and Niles are snobby cliches. Martin is the tough old guy with a heart of gold, quite cliched. Just because they are cliches doesn't make them bad characters. The same is true of Ronee.   Plus for the whole series we are led to believe that martin was deeply in love with his first wife. He seems to forget about her quickly when sassy ronee comes onto the scene.   They deal with this multiple times in the series. When Martin tries to break up with Sherry because he feels guilty about Hester, Frasier helps him through it and he slowly becomes able to love again. I'll post the episode number later.   But yet ronee is shoe horned in to give frasier a reason for leaving seattle. Destroyed martins character and meant we suffered ronee for several episodes.   Martin marrying Ronee is only a small part of why Frasier moved on. The point of the finale (I think) was that life is not something static; life is about change and seeking new adventures. We (and Frasier) are at our happiest when vigorously pursuing a dream of something better."
Frasier,3c6oyr,KidHauer,0,Sun Jul 5 13:14:58 2015 UTC,Martin isn't a complete jerk about being with Maureen like he is with Ronee.
Frasier,3c6oyr,Twiggy3,2,Tue Jul 7 12:38:53 2015 UTC,"I thought she was a pretty cool person. Down-to-earth and sassy yes, but not in an unkind way.   And I actually didn't think Martin was uncaring of Frasier's feelings at all. There were no feelings involved. It was more that Frasier liked the way she looked and got off on the idea of dating his old babysitter (kind of like when he got off on dating the prom queen... it had nothing to do with the woman and everything to do with his ego). Beyond that, they had nothing in common. Niles saw this right away, and Frasier admitted as much."
Frasier,3c6oyr,_sundry,2,Tue Jul 7 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"Nice try, Ms. Wojadubakowski."
Frasier,3c6oyr,Sorryaboutthat1time,2,Tue Jul 14 18:40:07 2015 UTC,"Martin becomes a complete hypocritical jerk in the last few seasons.  Two instances that come to my head are: this Ronee thing compared to the Maureen episode where he is racked with guilt over being with someone Frasier likes.  Watch the two episodes; caring father/complete jerk.  He doesn't mind over hearing Kenny's therapy, but he has a go at Frasier for listening to him and Ronee.  But yeah, I completely agree with you.  Ronee is just a bad copy of Sherry with all the worst parts pushed to extremes.  No problem with Martin moving on, but like that?  A completely rushed story to tie up all the loose ends?  Meh.   Fine.  Make sure she brings a friend so there's someone for you.   Little bit disappointed in the downvotes for this guy expressing an opinion."

Yeah Diane might range from a bit annoying to oh-my-god-stop, but dude. You know you've got to watch it, and you know you're going to love it anyway. It's not Frasier, but it's easy to see how it truly was protoFrasier."
Frasier,3bri4q,incompl337,4,Thu Jul 2 03:23:52 2015 UTC,"I watched Cheers earlier this year after having watched Frasier I don't even know how many times through. I enjoyed it so much on its own, even though I didn't expect to. I hated Diane on Frasier but actually grew to understand her more through watching Cheers. It also gave me such a greater appreciation of the Cheers/Frasier episodes, and just of Frasier in general. I got my 19 year old brother and my mom to watch a lot of the episodes with me, and we laughed so much.    One of my favorite lines was when they were watching Diane's dance video.    Diane: All my life I wanted to dance so badly! Norm: Looks like you got your wish."

You have to work through it. Besides, you get to enjoy Coach then meet Woody.  But yes, Rebecca is a much more entertaining character. Season 5 is a pain to get through though."
Frasier,3bri4q,Jereso,4,Wed Jul 1 21:37:03 2015 UTC,Really? Diane vs Sam is fun. Rebecca is boring. Did you watch Cheers during its run or later? I saw them when they were first broadcast.
Frasier,3bri4q,socrates_scrotum,2,Thu Jul 2 06:36:23 2015 UTC,"I watched them later.  I could imagine it being a very different experience watching them at the time.  But personally, after watching the whole Diane/Sam thing once, it was more than enough.  It was just the same story over and over again with Diane being the becoming a more and more irritating character and Shelley long's acting getting worse and worse.   I don't think I could cope with another 6 series of Sam and Diane nearly getting together, not getting together, one of them starts seeing someone else, drives the other mad, they get together, they break up, repeat.  Rebecca brought a whole new life to the show, with a character that one can actually relate to.  But I guess we just have different opinions."
Frasier,3bri4q,Twiggy3,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:23:45 2015 UTC,"No I watched them last year. There were definitely good bits with Diane, but it just got annoying overall with her. I do agree Rebecca can be boring but she isn't agitating like Diane was."
Frasier,3bri4q,Jereso,0,Thu Jul 2 11:56:02 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't phrase it very well.  My rewatching is in the order above, but I guess series 2, 3, 4 and 5 have to be watched for piecing the Frasier narrative together (even if the character is completely different).  But yeah, it gets so much better after series 5."

I learned that from the movie ""Home Alone"", where the sets and costumes were designed so they dont reflect the time (1990) in which the movie was made so much. The Star Trek series beginning from ""The Next Generation"" and ending with ""Enterprise"" were also designed to appear timeless (the hairstyles in these shows were for example more based on the 1920s to 1950s and the dialogue was intentionally not using contemporary phrases and words).  The same goes for ""Frasier"". The producers tried to make this show timeless by not referencing the time in which the show was made."

Frasier,3b9hux,Tele_Prompter,3,Sat Jun 27 03:17:07 2015 UTC,One thing hasnt held up: The picture quality of the show. Very blurry. And for some reason unlike many other sitcoms there seem to be no plan for an HD upgrade of the show. I am waiting for it to come out on bluray.

Yup, we got a Frasier fan here alright. :-)  I do agree with most of what you said, though I think Seinfeld holds up for similar reasons, dealing with everyday problems, most of which still exist today. But Frasier definitely took the ""classic"" sitcom model of farce and executed it to perfection, in many cases taking tropes that had been done to death and revitalizing them with the show's unique flair. In that sense, Frasier is extra appealing because it's almost like the culmination of a few different generations of TV sitcoms, and that gives it a very timeless quality."

Frasier,3ba7jr,KellyAnne_Grunther,4,Mon Jun 29 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"Season 6 5, with the Latino Music Station."
Frasier,3ba7jr,Spinetablet,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:35:58 2015 UTC,"I believe that Shutout in Seattle part 2 is the last episode of season 6, I don't remember any Latino music in that episode?"
Frasier,3ba7jr,Spinetablet,2,Sat Jun 27 17:10:41 2015 UTC,"I might be mistaken. I mean the episode when Frasier and the others go to talk to the head bossman at KACL, and he ends up deciding to axe the talk shows and play only Latino music.  Edit: My bad- I meant Season 5 finale."
Frasier,3ba7jr,pale_cerulean_dot,6,Sat Jun 27 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"You Can Go Home Again (Season 3 finale).   I love seeing how much the relationship between Niles, Frasier, and Martin has changed. The scene at the end where Frasier gives Daphne an extra week of vacation to go home and visit her family is really telling about how important his family now is to him.   Also, this line from Daphne: ""why is it so easy to love our families, yet so hard to like them?""  And the beginning of Frasier's first show is pretty amusing."
Frasier,3ba7jr,DoctorSteve,7,Sun Jun 28 14:32:17 2015 UTC,"Dark Victory is easily the best season finale. It showcases everything that makes Frasier at its core. It's raining, which is something the later seasons literally forgot to do. It's mostly in the apartment, while simultaneously using every area of the main stage. It uses all of the main characters in their element. Frasier is the hero instead of the victim (though he's also the victim).   You get to feel the cozyness of this early 90s penthouse, the connection (or dysfunction) of this group and fun bonding moments.  And Eddie is in it too!"
Frasier,3ba7jr,setmehigh,4,Sun Jun 28 20:16:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Dark Victory is pretty great."
Frasier,3ba7jr,itdothstink,3,Mon Jun 29 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"I love how simple and introspective the first three are.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe nobody besides the main cast appears in them.  I prefer those types of finales for Frasier as opposed to cliffhanger finales.  What's great is that the episodes they followed were real humdingers, like those episodes were the climaxes of their respective seasons and the finales are akin to going into analysis in order to resolve issues."
Frasier,3ba7jr,Democracy-Manifest,3,Sun Jun 28 22:40:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe a cop-out answer but season 11. Such a perfect finale. Bittersuite, wonderful speech and all the characters wrapped up. Not letting Frasier end up with Roz or happy with Charlotte is brave for a sit-com but much more believable."

Frasier,3b9ji4,ehabere1,2,Sun Jun 28 14:33:50 2015 UTC,"I answered #2 as 4 because of this: "" Daphne:  Well, last night, I told Niles that I wanted to marry him right then and there.   Niles:  And once I realized she was serious, we rushed out into the night, fully intending to.  Daphne:  But then we found out that in Washington, it takes three days to get a marriage license. ""  But now I feel as if I might have been wrong. Maybe they looked it up, and didn't actually go to a courthouse before going to Reno. Anyone have any thoughts?

Frasier,3ah5jz,Stinktiere,2,Sat Jun 20 04:23:29 2015 UTC,"Damn, I thought they weren't all very difficult. Also, Hallmark Channel cuts stuff. Not just censoring every mild profanity, but little segments all over the place. They are likely hiding answers if that's your only Frasier source."
Frasier,3ah5jz,KellyAnne_Grunther,2,Sat Jun 20 04:32:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I know about the profanity cuts, unfortunately, but haven't ever really noticed any other cuts. I think it's more likely my shit memory has few Frasier jokes ingrained like what I would need to do well on these.   Don't let me discourage you. I know a few Frasier episodes where I know pretty much all the words and jokes (I pretty much pantomime Niles in the ""Ham Radio"" episode), but I don't commit most of these things to memory."

I'd love if you could post the answers when it's done, for my sanity at least, and probably a few others. But I love reading these just to test myself any way, I'd feel disappointed if you dumbed it down for people like me.   I'm watching it right now, in fact, and love seeing jokes I've forgotten and love jokes I actually do remember, which are occasional but great.

At the very least, if you keep watching, you'll probably get more correct.   I'd love if you could post the answers when it's done, for my sanity at least, and probably a few others.   I will and always do! I'm flexible with the time, but I try to give everyone at least 24hrs. I'll most likely do so tonight, but maybe tomorrow.   But I love reading these just to test myself any way, I'd feel disappointed if you dumbed it down for people like me.   Glad you enjoy them! I'll stay the course. TV trivia isn't exactly an important life skill so don't sweat it!   I'm watching it right now, in fact, and love seeing jokes I've forgotten and love jokes I actually do remember, which are occasional but great.    That is fun, I agree.   Right now's an episode with Kirby which I know those episodes are a soft spot for some people, but I love them.   Kirby is funny! I love his little speech to Frasier at his graduation party. And his casual destruction of Niles' library. And his poor attempts at insulting the girl from Teen Scene. And his advances toward Roz. Lots of good Kirby stuff.

She was also a driver in the show Taxi for one episode and the same cab (#804) was used in the intro credits of Taxi. The cab also had a two part episode where all of the drivers referred to it as the cab with all the best stories. Kind of a cool nod to one of the earlier shows that some of the same writers and directors worked on."

Then Laura Linney of all people ended up playing Frasier's ultimate love interest Charlotte.  (Good grief this was a bit hard to type. Linney... Lynley... Linney... Lynley...)"
Frasier,3a764l,besyuziki,7,Wed Jun 17 19:45:16 2015 UTC,"I knew someone had complained, but didn't know it was Laura Linney. Also, I could be wrong here, but I always thought they simply changed her first name from Lorna to Lana. Her maiden name was Lynley, the one Frasier knew her as from high school. The name Gardner was from her marriage to Bob. (And the resulting Kirby Gardner, the son they had together.) After they did the name change from Lorna to Lana, they just didn't mention the maiden name of Lynley, probably due to the complaint they received. Anyway, that's the way I always understood it."

It's from ""Big Crane on Campus"", the first time Lorna is seen (at Cafe Nervosa). Emphasis on the last line.  Lorna: [arrives] Excuse me, didn't we go to high school together?   Frasier: Did we?  Lorna: Yes, I thought you looked familiar.  You're Frasier, aren't           you?  Frasier: Well, that's right. [laughs] All right, let me guess, em,           Lisa?  Lorna: Lorna.  Frasier: Oh yes, of course.  Hello.  Roz, I'd like you to meet Lorna           Ann Lenley. [Lorna looks surprised] Anywhere close?  Lorna: Very good!

There are some interesting theories on the meaning of tossed salad and scrambled eggs out there if you care to look!  Also, apparently it was known for a bit as ""the gayest show on television"" for having several gay actors (Niles, Gil, etc.)--I'd never have guessed that the actor who portrayed Bob ""Bulldog"" Briscoe was not at all interested in women! haha"

Seeing all my favorite landmarks exactly as they were in my childhood... the bearded fishmonger throwing fish in Pike's Place, whom I have met many times, but no longer works there.   To me, that show is a love letter to Seattle. A homage to the people of Seattle, and the beautiful city it has called home.  Even though I have been back only once in the 5 years since I've moved, everytime I watch that episode it puts me right back in that cozy Seattle-feel."

I have done nearly zero traveling (that's the farthest I've gone, by far) and really liked the city even though the point of the trip was essentially all business. I can absolutely see feeling that way having lived there, especially during the same time. It is a very nice aspect of the episode.

Frasier,39sujr,K3R3G3,3,Mon Jun 15 22:29:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm certainly no fan. I also skip the Charlotte episodes when watching Season 11 and I know I disagree with almost every other Frasier fan when I say that I wasn't all too thrilled with the final episode of the series. There were positives but I would much rather have seen Frasier land in San Francisco rather than chase after Charlotte in Chicago. I would have been far more satisfied."
Frasier,39sujr,Chris220,2,Tue Jun 16 07:21:40 2015 UTC,"Glad to talk to a fellow Charlotte Skipper! Haha. As for the finale, I skip it since it's a Charlotte episode and it's also pretty depressing to watch the final one, purely because it's the last. Also, since it's a daily show for me to watch, seeing the ""end"" doesn't serve much purpose. I don't really hold an opinion on the finale for those reasons and because I don't feel compelled to form one. For a series like Frasier, you can hop around and watch any episode and it's still funny and all makes sense. Something with a strong, continuous, suspenseful storyline such as The Sopranos or Breaking Bad is something for which everything builds toward the finale and it's enormously important."
Frasier,39sujr,K3R3G3,2,Tue Jun 16 14:29:49 2015 UTC,"It's one of the things I love about a show such as Frasier: That you can watch an episode any time and not worry about watching the series chronologically.

Frasier,39pdd8,Slawg3r_777,19,Sat Jun 13 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah it doesn't make a huge amount of sense, but Frasier's psyche doesn't either.   This is how I see it: Throughout Frasier's life, he's always been relatively successful (at least in the field of academia). He has both a Harvard and an Oxford degree after all. So when Frasier is interacting with people throughout his day, he's constantly thinking (assuming) that he's more intelligent, and more successful than others.   This all changes when he's amongst his old school peers, who might actually be more intelligent and more successful than himself. He still has a yearning to be seen as the more intelligent person, but he knows deep down that this might not be the case. He also assumes that his old peers are those who indulge in gossip and will bad-talk Frasier's name, and I think this frightens Frasier. Not being recognized as the most intelligent and successful person in the room scares him, because it could mean that all the effort he puts into his career, all the time he's invested into becoming the 'more intelligent and successful person', could all be for nothing.  I think this is a similar thought process to when Frasier receives his lifetime achievement award. As Professor Tewksbury put it ""at the age of eight - at EIGHT - you began to use psychiatry as a way to deal with a world that scared you to death...and once it's gone, all you'll have left is that frightened eight-year-old boy."" Similarly, Frasier has used his career and his success as a way to see himself as head and shoulders above the rest, but once he isn't more successful than the other people around him, Frasier will just be average - something that he never wants to have to admit."
Frasier,39pdd8,MarkyMark8,5,Sat Jun 13 13:39:42 2015 UTC,"This was a great response!! The quote from his old professor was perfect, I forgot that frasier is afraid of losing everything, he hides behind his career and profession."
Frasier,39pdd8,Twiggy3,7,Sat Jun 13 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"Frasier will just be average - something that he never wants to have to admit.    Which is one of the few things that continues from Cheers, when both he and Lilith are worried about Freddie being average."
Frasier,39pdd8,darkknight131313,3,Sat Jun 13 16:35:28 2015 UTC,"It's really just a preying on his insecurities as always. He could have done even more than that, that doesn't matter. All he feels that sums him up as a person is where he is at this moment. Single, employed, happy? If he's not all those things he feels he is a failure."
Frasier,39pdd8,Twiggy3,3,Sat Jun 13 15:34:37 2015 UTC,"I never really thought about it that way, something new to consider I suppose.  I always went by the fact that he isn't famous any more (as the Niles line goes) and thus a failure to his snobby ""friends""."
Frasier,39pdd8,EXmaster7,3,Sat Jun 13 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"I think you have a point, actually! Frasier was always concerned that reunions coincided with a downturn in his life, and he kind of compares his classmates with Seattle's elite crowd. They'd pick him dry if he had any failures that stick out.  Kind of like a scratch on wood flooring before a party."

As someone who lost their job a few months ago saying to people ""I was a well respected teacher in this schools for many years, but now I'm unemployed"" doesn't feel good. Frasier even says himself that the reunion coincides with some sort of downturn - people at these reunions only see success as where you are now. Not where you were."

He spun around with a kick and hit Daphne who landed on her wrist, spraining it.   Q2. Trust exercise! Niles and Frasier were at couples therapy, practicing falling off of a step stool into each others arms. But neither trusted one another enough (""is he wearing rubber souls?"" ""you know, he catches like a girl"") to actually follow through.  Q3. Frasier's Living Brain was sent to the Cranes of Maine, so he had to go shopping for new gifts for Freddy. The store in the mall that sold educational toys was closed, so Frasier bought toys from the man pictured for $1000 (well, really $300 - Niles' check wouldn't have cleared).  Q4. Frasier recieved a ""no-no"" slip from Ms(erable old cow) Langer, the condo board president, for installing a door knocker on his front door.   Q5. ""my goddess!"" Frasier succumbs to Lilith, who is horrified to see him changing into a robe as she slept with Niles (who's hiding in the bathroom) that previous night.  Bonus: ""everyday in Arkansas!"" Niles and Lilith are trying to figure out what to do now after realizing that they slept together.   Fun format!"

Frasier,38c2ko,Sorryaboutthat1time,2,Wed Jun 3 18:56:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed - Kate Costas was one of the best love interests for Frasier on the show, ever. She was well-matched to him intellectually, professionally, and though I think she might have been a tad too beautiful for him (just my opinion), at least she was  properly in his age-range. Also - like Roz - Kate was able to find Frasier's snobbishness endearing, but at the same time she didn't take any nonsense from him.   Frasier (complaining about Bulldog): ""I did not spend eight grueling years at Harvard to be mocked by that juvenile jackass!""  Kate: ""Shameless!""  Frasier: ""Oh, he's beyond shameless!""  Kate: ""I'm talking about the way you manage to get Harvard into every conversation.""  Frasier: ""Well, I'm sure you'll mention your alma mater too some day - just as soon as it's accredited.""  Kate: ""Gee, you sure know how to ask for help.""  Frasier: ""I'm sorry...""  Kate: ""I know, I'll take care of it.""  Frasier: ""Just make sure he understands that...""

Frasier,38c2ko,KellyAnne_Grunther,4,Thu Jun 4 01:16:21 2015 UTC,'Frasier's Imaginary Friend' is one of my favourite episodes of the series! I think it's because of Frasier's terrible dating record that the story works. I also love that it picks up more or less where season 4 left off.

And there were plenty of absurd plotlines in the show, but they were usually at least fitting for the characters involved (like Michael Keaton's Blaine who makes no sense on the surface but seems written and acted in a way that it's still believable). It was not remotely believable to me that Phil Patterson could actually believe he was abducted by aliens, or that the belief would not have come up earlier to someone else."

I've always been a bit turned off when a really great ensemble cast is missing for an entire episode (not an exact parallel, but my least favorite Arrested Development is the one with Martin Short as a guest star, and the rest of the cast have to back off a bit to let him do his thing). I've also never been crazy about dream-state, supernatural type episodes in shows that were set in the real world. All-in-all it just misses the mark for me."

Everyone treats the inappropriate/illegal relationship as a huge joke.    I also didn't like the one when Frasier had the black substitute producer (I don't remember her name.  Mary?).  I know they were trying to jab at white guilt but they didn't handle it as well as 30 Rock and others have.  Frasier's speech as a black woman made me cringe.  I did enjoy Martin's no nonsense take on the subject though.

He shares a moment with this unknown woman at the table and then you find out at the end, this woman he was talking so nicely to before, was the mother of the guy who shot him.  When they're in the cabin and watching the video of their mother together.  A real touching moment of the 3 of them.

It was the end of the story arc where Bulldog loses his job and he starts helping Roz out and along the way you can tell that he genuinely adores the baby and is in love with Roz. But, Roz doesn't realize it, which results in a harsher unintended rejection and the moment she realizes it because of Bulldog's reaction and his subsequently trying to casually play it off is so sweet and so heart-breaking."

As for speculation regarding Bulldog -- I believe/feel that the person we saw him be in that situation is genuine, and that the bulk of his bravado and other behaviors are a cover. I could be wrong, though.    In the same way, it's very easy to be dismissive of Roz finding true love and settling down because she is promiscuous. But, at the heart and soul of both characters, they are really just standard issue human beings with feelings and fears, who want love, acceptance and validation.    Expanding on that further -- the whole irony of the series (and the reason it's so funny) is because the two main protagonists do not see themselves as they truly are, and they feel they are above all the ""common, workaday"" people in their lives. The fact that they are both psychiatrists is the perfect final touch on the whole scenario. They get paid to help others, when they are the epitome of the phrase ""Physician, heal thyself."""

Frasier,37a6t1,proud_tory,3,Tue May 26 18:47:51 2015 UTC,I wouldn't dare try and get the quote right.. But one of my favorites is when Niles is talking to Joe about Daphne - it's something along the lines of she is so wonderful and some men can only dream about here in their (name of some designer chair) with the lights off. Niles was most definitely a ferocious masturbater.
Frasier,37a6t1,digitalgameplan,2,Tue May 26 20:18:16 2015 UTC,"Paraphrases incoming   Niles ! A beloved Seattle institution is closing Roz, you're moving !?!   hides under a rock"
Frasier,37a6t1,jo_maka,1 point,Thu May 28 03:51:45 2015 UTC,"There's lots of sexual innuendo, but this is certainly up there. I enjoyed when Roz was talking about how much she's not the biggest fan of space but ""There's just something about rockets though."" Frasier's knowing and Freudian-motivated ""Yes, well..."" is good. There are lots of examples, I enjoy them."
Frasier,37a6t1,K3R3G3,-5,Wed May 27 03:37:10 2015 UTC,"When I re-watch Frasier I'm often astonished at how much Roz is painted as a slut.  As in, the show makes it extremely clear that she has a lot of sex and is generally very slutty, but it's always done in slightly oblique fashion due to infamous ""standards and practices.""  As if we're fucking idiots that don't know what they're talking about.  Fuck censorship, and fuck the FCC."
Frasier,37a6t1,alchemeron,17,Tue May 26 08:56:34 2015 UTC,"I really thought this was intentional. It's easy to just have every punchline be ""she's such a slut""  It's harder to make complex jokes with innuendos. I appreciate the complexity"
Frasier,37a6t1,xrosasx,-4,Tue May 26 10:10:31 2015 UTC,"I understand that nuance is often funnier than something broad and blunt, but there are many situations in sitcoms where they hint at something or clearly want to go further than they're able, and it's not just about being witty."
Frasier,37a6t1,alchemeron,0,Tue May 26 10:15:26 2015 UTC,"Especially in the first seasons, it almost looks she sleeping with a different man every night. Luckily in the later seasons she calms down a bit."
Frasier,374s1t,Gramercy_Riffs,7,Sun May 24 21:42:30 2015 UTC,I think the episode where frasier and niles talk about how she gained the weight and everyone noticed but him did some real justice to this lazy story arc. Some of my favorite dialogue.
Frasier,374s1t,The2ndPoptart,1 point,Mon May 25 17:59:35 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this part. Much as I didn't like the way Leeves pregnancy was handled, this dialogue was well written. Frasier says something along the lines of he hopes he'll love someone the way Niles loves Daphne, and the look on Niles face at that moment, was just perfect."
Frasier,374s1t,At-Amber,7,Wed May 27 20:51:09 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I really hated how the writers of the show decided to handle her real life pregnancy on the show. To just call her fat all the time was just too easy and cheap.  I could tell that they may have felt bad when she basically went to ""fat camp"" and then Niles said that she lost 8 lbs. 10 oz. or whatever it was."
Frasier,374s1t,jcwitte,6,Mon May 25 00:13:54 2015 UTC,Agreed. Seems to me they had to stretch a bit to create tension between her and Niles. Hard to top his secret obsession with her. Really some of the funniest scenes are Niles reactions to some of the things she says and does.
Frasier,374s1t,digitalgameplan,7,Mon May 25 02:42:07 2015 UTC,"That was actually a reference to the weight of her child when (s)he was born. It's sorta cute, actually."
Frasier,374s1t,deliciousmeats,1 point,Mon May 25 04:29:17 2015 UTC,I knew that was a reference. I still stand by what I said though. It's not fair to the actress (sorry forgot her name) to just portray her as a fattie who can't control her eating even though she was super thin the rest of the series.
Frasier,374s1t,jcwitte,3,Mon May 25 12:33:59 2015 UTC,"I do agree with some points, but they didn't just make her fat. These was a pretty decent arc about how her eating was a psycological problem stemming from trying to keep her husband, whom she thought was out way out of her social class, happy. That expanded a lot on story in that season, I feel.  But the fat thing was a bit cheap in other ways."
Frasier,374s1t,Spinetablet,1 point,Mon May 25 19:13:35 2015 UTC,I thought it was a really clever arc.
Frasier,374s1t,DoctorSteve,2,Wed May 27 07:25:44 2015 UTC,Has it gotten to this point on reddit? Is being fat so terrible that you actually feel bad for an actress who is playing the part of an overweight person? Seriously? Do you feel bad for actors who have to portray child molestors and serial killers? Do you feel bad for Peri Gilpin because Roz was called a slut for years? And it was so clear that Jane Leeves was pregnant. Obviously they were covering it up with that plot.
Frasier,374s1t,useless-knowledge,2,Tue May 26 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"What alternatives would there be? I mean it's either fat or pregnancy. The writers clearly didn't want to go the pregnancy route and have their child be part of the show, having left it for the end of the series. The OP's scene was from ""Hungry Heart"" which was Season 8 Episode 14. She was already well along in her actual pregnancy and she and Niles had just gotten together in Season 8 Episode 1. There would've been only a few episodes between their getting together and Daphne getting pregnant. I think that would've been much worse. She'd have been pregnant before Niles and Mel were divorcing. I don't think the way the story went was easy and cheap. And the alternative of near instant pregnancy upon getting together would've been bizarre and required stories with their baby for 3 seasons. There's actually one more alternative -- get rid of Daphne. And that likely wouldn't happen. I think the writers did what they had to do and did a good job considering Leeves got pregnant."
Frasier,374s1t,K3R3G3,1 point,Mon May 25 21:50:42 2015 UTC,"The Office and Parks and Recreation quite easily hid the pregnancies of Angela Kinsey (Angela) and Amy Poehler by wardrobe and camera angles. Those are the only 2 I could think of off the top of my head, but I'm sure there have been other examples."
Frasier,374s1t,jcwitte,2,Mon May 25 22:49:09 2015 UTC,The rushed/clumsy fat camp story was worth it for the episode where Daphne returns in my opinion.

Frasier,36nhxy,Slawg3r_777,16,Wed May 20 17:54:54 2015 UTC,I never thought it would happen between Niles and Daphne and remember literally gasping when Daphne showed up in the RV in her wedding dress haha.
Frasier,36nhxy,razrhead,8,Wed May 20 23:59:30 2015 UTC,Yes. Pretty much from the beginning. I was surprised but happy when it finally happened!

Frasier,36nhxy,cheesedickboatride,6,Thu May 21 01:44:27 2015 UTC,"Problem is that Vera actually appears once or twice on Cheers. You never see her face (I think in at least one of these appearances it's because a pie is thrown in her face accidentally just as she walks in), but it still counts."
Frasier,36nhxy,shearhartattack,2,Thu May 21 02:53:22 2015 UTC,"I mean we see her back at Carla's house for thanksgiving,  and her legs on the stairs when she was working at Melville's. But never really see what she looks like."

Frasier,36nhxy,C_Brooks11,9,Sun May 24 22:48:01 2015 UTC,Also - It's important to note that pretty much at the same time as Niles/Daphne we had Ross/Rachel happening on Friends. Will they/Won't they was being overdone so it felt that it was wiser to keep Niles' affection distant and unreciprocated.
Frasier,36nhxy,Stinktiere,3,Wed May 20 20:41:28 2015 UTC,Ross and Rachel are one of the most unhealthy relationships I've seen on TV. I know not everything was perfectly healthy with Niles' crush on Daphne but he tried his best to do everything the right way.
Frasier,36nhxy,thenepenthe,6,Thu May 21 01:28:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, especially when Niles just got the divorce and he turns around and you see Donny and Daphne together. I was so heartbroken. :(  In later episodes they were so happy together.   I, btw, disagree that the series went down hill after Niles and Daphne got together. The series has a constant quality with just a few minor episodes."
Frasier,36nhxy,TheWorstNL,3,Thu May 21 10:57:51 2015 UTC,It was even worse when he ended up with Mel.

Frasier,36nhxy,hawaiianshirtday2,3,Thu May 21 03:53:16 2015 UTC,"Moonlighting had a ""will-they-won't-they"" thing with two of the main characters. Once they conclusively got together, it was the beginning of the end.   There were other factors (Bruce's movie career started taking off, Cybil getting sick of the workload, a botched attempt to reignite the chemistry) but it certainly didn't help."
Frasier,36nhxy,Ancisace,0,Thu May 21 15:30:05 2015 UTC,"During Moonlighting, the characters played by Cybill Shepherd (sp?) and Bruce Willis had this chemistry of love-hate that everyone wanted to see turn into a relationship.  When they finally did get together, the show's ratings dropped. Even in Cheers, the sexual tension between Sam and Diane kept everyone rooting for them, but when they finally got together, something was lost.  I don't know but I assume that's why Diane dumped him and we ended up with Kirstie's character.  It just wasn't the same without the sexual tension.  But the relationship between Niles and Daphne seemed to be the exception to prove the rule."
Frasier,36nhxy,cinemascoop,3,Thu May 21 19:07:44 2015 UTC,I wish it never happened. The show went down hill that season. Anthony lapaglia and the whole Moon family were terrible.

Maybe they should have just reversed the tables and make Daphne really like Niles, while Niles just is in love with someone else and be over her. Not like Mel, someone better.  I also blame this on Daphne's attitude in the last couple of seasons. Meaner and full of bad jokes sometimes."

I would understand if they were main characters or something, but I thought that they did a great job in their limited roles?  Is the male/female ratio so off because of the show, or because of reddit or the Internet or something else?"
Frasier,36brcs,NewMerril,7,Mon May 18 02:39:01 2015 UTC,Donny I get because of how things ended up with him. I personally thought he was kind of annoying even before that with his jokes and all.   And I'd say the m/f ratio is because of reddit.
Frasier,36brcs,NewMerril,2,Mon May 18 02:40:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because I really love him in other roles (e.g., Warehouse 13)? I don't know. I really liked his stuff ranging from the towel/mustard stuff to his next engagement."

Frasier,3621kj,neszero,4,Fri May 15 15:59:13 2015 UTC,I just moved out of state about a month ago and have been by myself for the past month waiting for my Gf to join me here. I think I've gone through the entire show twice in that time. I love how I can put it on and play video games and just listen. Most the time I know what's going on with out even looking at the screen. Frasier and Golden Girls are the only 2 shows I can do that with. Feels familiar and like home.
Frasier,3621kj,MyNightmaresAreGreen,3,Fri May 15 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm about halfway through season 10 right now, and for some reason the writing seems a lot more forced/off-the-mark to me. I don't know if it can be attributed to the loss of David Angell's contribution to the show, the writer's strike that was going on, or just the show reaching its old age. I still enjoy the later episodes, but they don't shine with the brilliance that the earlier ones did.   Also, I'm totally with you on Frasier being a comfort-show; binge watching it has gotten me through some rough times in my life more than once."

Frasier,35n7j0,Sproose_Moose,1 point,Tue May 12 02:09:24 2015 UTC,"Ya, I don't think that Frasier and Niles' mother was always cast in the most glowing light. Most of these differences that I see here about the differences in Frasiers personality can easily be chalked up to trying to fit in with where he is (we all do this as human beings. ie with Niles, they grew up being snooty and all, but when his social circle are a bunch of common folk without his brother as a crutch, then he adapts to that situation) and him overcoming his social anxieties and growing into who he really is and feels comfortable with. Also, Frasier started with him having a contentious relationship with his father, so that could also explain him lying about his family."

One is the lizard in the box, another is the Halloween prank on/with Bulldog, another is when he dresses as a clown and scares his dad! He's done plenty of other jokes, like buying Roz a gag gift."

Frasier,35n7j0,Twiggy3,6,Tue May 12 18:02:40 2015 UTC,"Frasier is most definitely a fussier character on the Frasier series than he is in Cheers. I do think, however that he enjoys a beer from time to time. There was that one episode where he constantly visits Daphne's favorite pub. On the whole, however, he does have his down to earth moments on the Frasier series. These usually occur when he's not hanging around with Niles. Perhaps his brother has been a bad influence on him :-).  I've always thought it was interesting, however that John Mahoney (Martin Crane) appears in an episode of Cheers as an entirely different character (i.e.: not as Frasier's father)."
Frasier,35n7j0,morning_espresso,6,Tue May 12 02:38:39 2015 UTC,Didn't he actually say something about him becoming a lot stuffier/snobbier since moving back to seattle? I thought I remembered that.

At least, that's what I remember. I just rewatched the series recently so everything kinda runs together. Haha"

Frasier,35n7j0,Sorryaboutthat1time,1 point,Tue May 12 21:05:08 2015 UTC,Usually when this subject is brought up I'll say this: Frasier on Cheers is like Niles in Frasier when he's first introduced. If Frasier had never ran into the Cheers gang back then he would have likely been just like Niles forever but thanks to his Cheers days they loosened him up a bit and brought him down to earth more. You can really see the effects throughout Frasier as he is much more open-minded when it comes to doing things both would consider to be rash or unorthodox in comparison to their tastes. It takes it until the last few seasons of the show but Niles eventually does become a bit less rigid in his mannerisms too but Frasier by far was much more mindful to try new things and not be so stuffy thanks to the Cheers gang influence.

Definitely one of my favorite blogs.  Lots of inside info on Frasier, among other shows.  He even posted a diagram of Frasier's apartment there."

Frasier,35k0kg,Sproose_Moose,12,Mon May 11 08:51:38 2015 UTC,Nope. Nope nope nope. Sorry but I think the chemistry between Jane and David/Daphne and Niles is perfect. No one could replace them.
Frasier,35k0kg,useless-knowledge,3,Mon May 11 11:39:03 2015 UTC,"I agree that Jane Leeves is perfect as Daphne, and I wouldn't change a thing, but you have to admit that Daphne and Niles had ZERO chemistry. Some of the more romantic scenes later in the series are actually hard to watch. I don't even dislike how/that they got together, and they aren't a bad couple by any means. They just have no chemistry."
Frasier,35k0kg,Axadarm,2,Wed May 13 07:24:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I've posted extensively about it before but I never liked the Niles/Daphne ship. Frasier nailed it best - he was never in love with her, he was in love AT her. I might even venture that it went as far as Niles convinced himself Daphne was the one because initially due to absence of affection from Maris then once things fizzled there Niles barely even tried to see other women as he still put Daphne on that impossible pedestal. His problem was he put all his eggs in one basket - it didn't matter who he tried to move on with or how he tried to move on as he was obsessed with the woman in an unhealthy way and he sabotaged himself with any other romantic prospect intentionally or unconsciously by not even trying. As you saw in the show Niles had a social life that mirrored his brother's - nothing, except Frasier was much more confident with women and would actually try meeting new ones while Niles couldn't. He even alludes that before Maris he never really had much romance with any other women (there was at least one that he mentions in The Club that he was with in college) so that's more evidence that supports the fact that Daphne was pretty much the only other woman in his life when he was with Maris and afterwards it was just Daphne so it's not surprising he clung to her for so long being she was someone he saw I imagine many times a week, year after year.   Already on a second paragraph and didn't want to be but don't even get me started on Daphne and how they wrote them to get together. Daphne had ZERO interest in Niles apart from appreciating him as a good friend but suddenly develops this intense love for him as soon as she discovers he had a crush on her!? What is she, 16? She then proceeds to devastate a doting guy who has been nothing but great for her and a person who is actually compatible with her and they get together at the expense of ruining two other people. I will give you Mel was a Maris lite-lite-lite but nevertheless they hurt people in the process of acting like kids who think they've discovered the meaning of love."
Frasier,35k0kg,Sproose_Moose,1 point,Thu May 14 16:08:53 2015 UTC,I guess that I just love them getting together so I never thought about it. I can agree.
Frasier,35k0kg,Mocha_Hagotdi,0,Wed May 13 07:29:26 2015 UTC,"No one could replace David, he might be the best comedic actor around. But as much as I love and rewatch Frasier, Jane's completely phoney Manc accent becomes a bit tiring after a while. I don't think much of her timing either."
Frasier,35k0kg,Sproose_Moose,4,Mon May 11 12:05:09 2015 UTC,But she's actually English... you think an American could do better?
Frasier,35k0kg,Mocha_Hagotdi,2,Mon May 11 12:06:23 2015 UTC,She's British with a terrible fake Manc accent. I lived in Manchester for a couple of years and know.   If she'd have played the role with her actual accent it would have been better.
Frasier,35k0kg,Twiggy3,3,Mon May 11 12:21:50 2015 UTC,If she could act it would have been better.
Frasier,35k0kg,sendmorekittens,4,Mon May 11 19:04:49 2015 UTC,Virtually no one cares if her particular dialect of a British accent is authentic. If that's your criticism then they did a bang-up job.
Frasier,35k0kg,Mocha_Hagotdi,1 point,Mon May 11 13:23:07 2015 UTC,"My criticism is that it's barely a British accent at all, it's akin to Dick van Dykes accent in Mary Poppins, one which has been ridiculed for years. I'm pretty sure I've never heard anyone anywhere in the UK speak with that harsh whine.   Admittedly it gets better towards the end of the series, but I still think it could have been cast better."
Frasier,35k0kg,Twiggy3,2,Mon May 11 13:41:12 2015 UTC,Totally agree.  It`s like her entire experience of a manc accent is someone else describing it to her...badly.

It's more like an American doing a southern accent, or a Boston accent, without being from there."
Frasier,35k0kg,CowsGoMooToo,3,Mon May 11 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"Her accent being from manchester was a running joke, look at when her brothers came to visit all with different acccents, not to mention all the people that referenced her being from Manchester just on the basis of her accent.  Everyone knows it wasn't genuine, and it doesn't even matter."
Frasier,35k0kg,Twiggy3,0,Mon May 11 17:29:01 2015 UTC,I think anyone could do a better Manc accent.  High pitched whining isn't how you do it.  Dick Van Dyke could do a better job!

Frasier,35k0kg,Mocha_Hagotdi,2,Tue May 12 12:15:57 2015 UTC,"If I remember correct, she starts whining at him because there is a draught and that she can't eat the food. While he runs around trying to sort everything.   That's her whole persona in the final 3 series."

One of his highschool mates mistook him for homeless, and gave him his wife's card who was involved in a charity of sorts for the homeless.  edit - My favorite part from that episode:  Frasier (to Roz, written on paper): YOU'RE FIRED  Roz (to Frasier, written on paper): I'M UNION  Frasier twitches and glares at Roz and Roz smirks back"

There are scenarios where him speaking Spanish to Marta would've helped things, but he didn't do so.

This ludicrous thing is ""painting our bottoms and running to the sandwich shop"". In this imaginary scenario, people would be showing others something new (their painted asses) and, presumably, getting free sandwiches from the sandwich shop (just like Niles getting free coffee from Cafe Nervosa.)

Says his gf and him only have sex in common  Caller: ""We have sex twice everyday and three times on weekends""  Frasier: ""well with every relati...three times you say?""  Caller: ""Why is that abnormal?""  Frasier: ""Abnormal? No....Not fair But not abnormal""  In the backround you can see roz crack up in her booth. Never feels like you're watching a show but watching how life is. Really one of the best shows ever."

Frasier,35a9kb,OutlawLaserRobo-Geek,2,Fri May 8 15:17:18 2015 UTC,"Fully agree with this. In addition to it having greater realism, it sort of feels more like you're there with them by getting to see their reactions. And while the acting is always very good, some of the smiles and laughs seem more authentic. Like when Niles is trying to get his dog to do something, Frasier really seems to be entertained. ""Girl! Come back here! Girl!....Okay!"" [Niles prances after her.] Evidence for some (certainly not all) instances can be found by watching bloopers where an actor can't keep it together and laughs. Then you watch the actual scene and can see they're genuinely entertained."
Frasier,35a9kb,K3R3G3,3,Fri May 8 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, often you'll see Martin smile while he sits in his chair and someone makes a witty remark. Often I can't but think it's a real smile and he simply can't hold it together."
Frasier,35a9kb,TheWorstNL,3,Fri May 8 23:41:23 2015 UTC,"The scene where Niles says "" I'm fine.  Just a little hot.  And foamy.""  is the best example for it. Watching the bloopers and then the actual scene again you can see how Martin just couldn't hold his laughter"
Frasier,35a9kb,Drusss,1 point,Sat May 9 04:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's a good one w/blooper evidence. Same with when Niles flips the coin. I think that was referenced in an interview (no footage of Martin laughing.)"

Frasier,3545go,ehabere1,5,Thu May 7 00:50:09 2015 UTC,"Best: I really liked Roger, but I'd probably go with Bulldog... when he was baby sitting Alice. Even though he wasn't her boyfriend then, I think they would have been a good couple. Donny was good too, though. I guess a tough call.   Worst: For Roz, Ben. My least favorite was probably Luke. Both Ben and Luke were scumbags."

I think I'll have to agree with what most are saying -- Bulldog and Roger were best, but it's a tough call between the two. Roz thought she was better than both, at least at some point, and ended up getting dumped by both, right? Although she was prepared to dump Bulldog.   It would've been interesting if she and Frasier ended up together, something I rarely (or never) see mentioned here. Call me crazy, but I think Kelsey may have had a thing for Peri in real life. There are two potentially controversial opinions."

Frasier,34x1wh,Beautifuldays,2,Tue May 5 21:11:49 2015 UTC,I don't think we ever needed a mod for this. Why not kick this off yourself with a weekly post?

The same is true of /u/K3R3G3's weekly quizzes. I remember when s/he first started doing those and even the first few stayed at the top of the sub for a good few days even without a sticky. If you're a regular contributor and do a weekly post, it'll probably be the same. I say go for it. :)"
Frasier,34x1wh,sublimesam,3,Wed May 6 02:08:23 2015 UTC,Ok!  I'll give it a shot and start it up this Saturday morning then.  Thanks for the support!
Frasier,34x1wh,richard-karn,2,Wed May 6 02:12:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's a good idea to keep the community active. The whole reason we have a new mod is that the sub has become really active in the past year or so and the original creator of this sub checked out of here a long time ago (they are also mod/creator of 90 different subreddits). This prompted a discussion between me and /u/K3R3G3 which resulted in the owner making them a mod. But the more people making regular contributions, the better."

You always have great contributions to this subreddit.  I love this subreddit because it's the only TV show subreddit I can tolerate. It's Always Sunny, Peep Show, The Office, all shows I like but the communities around them just post screenshots from the latest episodes - yes, I get it...I saw that too. Maybe it helps that Frasier is off the air but it seems like people in this sub actually love talking about the show rather than memes and other crap.  I was trying to explain this show the other day and I had a fun time doing so. It's such a smart show and I feel in many ways, the writing was much smarter than the audience. The biggest laughs for me were often things that the audience didn't go crazy for. I hope that doesn't sound pedantic. I just feel the writing was more clever than it ever got credit for and is the reason the show is still watchable today.  I'd be down for a community rewatch and discussion including favorite moment and or joke from each. Would be cool!"

Frasier,34ph4p,Drusss,3,Sun May 3 11:11:40 2015 UTC,Cool idea. I honeslty have no clue who any mods and they are who'd be able to do that. But you can pm me and I'll do my best with any questions you may have -- can't make any promises about French though! That's a language I know very little about.
Frasier,34ph4p,Drusss,4,Sun May 3 13:51:33 2015 UTC,You know what K3R3G3 I always assumed you were a mod here :) The amount of of time and effort you put in here is even more noteworthy now. I hope /u/dorkside takes the decision and makes you a mod here asap!   Yes will definitely ask you any jokes I did not get :) Thanks a lot!
Frasier,34ph4p,Drusss,3,Mon May 4 03:47:39 2015 UTC,"That is greatly appreciated. Thank you. He/she actually made me a mod late last night, which is awesome. So if stuff comes up, like the recent request for that sticky post, I can actually do it."
Frasier,34ph4p,solitaire3435,2,Tue May 5 04:03:03 2015 UTC,I think my previous reply didn't make it because of the reddit maintenance!   Congratulations man :) You deserve it absolutely! Hopefully when we make the sub more active than it is! You should totally start with the sticky posts especially for the weekly quiz !
Frasier,34ph4p,Drusss,1 point,Tue May 5 05:50:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I might, but not sure yet. I almost always view my subscribed subreddits as a mix, rarely alone. In that view, stickied posts don't show up. I've missed contests and stuff in other subreddits, as a result, and most of others may browse in the same fashion. With the small amount of posts that occur in /r/Frasier, it's likely unnecessary for visibility, but maybe I'll try it to see if it drives up participation."
Frasier,34ph4p,solitaire3435,2,Tue May 5 06:01:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed! K3R3G3 your Friday Frasier Trivia really adds a lot to this sub, I check it every week (although I miss a lot of the questions hahaha) and it would be awesome if you were a mod here. =)"

Frasier,34ph4p,MarkyMark8,3,Tue May 5 05:24:41 2015 UTC,"There's only one mod, /u/dorkside, and as far as I know they're not very active around here. Never seen him/her post or comment."
Frasier,34ph4p,sublimesam,3,Sun May 3 14:38:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've never seen him/her post here either. I wouldn't mind being made a mod here -- could do things like the sticky suggestion. There's likely no other sub I'd feel more comfortable or qualified to be one. Perhaps, he'll get your page and drop in."
Frasier,34ph4p,sublimesam,3,Sun May 3 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"Same here. When I noticed that there were no active mods, my first assumption was that this sub probably wasn't always as active as it is now and the mod is unaware that there is an active community here.   I've also been involved in one sub (/r/peacecorps) where there was one completely inactive mod who refused to give up ownership of the sub or even bring on any other mods, despite the fact that they hadn't posted anything on reddit in months and there were a lot of people who wanted to do a lot of positive things with the community. They ended up having to go off and create a new sub (/r/peacecorpsvolunteers) and try to get everyone to move over. They did a beautiful job and the new sub is awesome, but it was a huge mess.  But there's no reason not to message them and see what's up. I'd mod as well."

Frasier,346s3b,Sproose_Moose,3,Wed Apr 29 00:07:34 2015 UTC,Maybe I am wrong. But she did go on to star in her own show for 6 seasons. Whether or not Faye was supposed to continue as a character.

Frasier,346s3b,razrhead,0,Wed Apr 29 16:18:08 2015 UTC,I had this exact thought yesterday! An episode of judging Amy was on and from the season airing now to the one just before it looks like she's aged so much. From looking like Faye to looking like a 40 year old mother of 3.

She's the one who says, ""It wasn't us."" Does anyone know who she is? I swear she went on to become some well-known actress because she looks so familiar, but she isn't in the credits.

One slight thing - Just watching the episode and the bar isn't called ""The Sure Thing"" It's called ""Granville's"". Roz called it the sure thing cause every time she took a friend there they met someone. But Rodney refers to the bar as ""Granville's"" later in the episode.

Frasier,343838,besyuziki,2,Wed Apr 29 21:34:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you, glad you enjoyed it. It is true that Granville's is the actual bar name. Rodney calls it that when Niles catches him with Adele. Niles meets her there in his stead. Thanks for pointing this out. I should've been more thorough/specific in my question, stating I was seeking the nickname, not the actual bar name. I just thought back to the ""The Sure Thing"" joke with Frasier and went with it. Though I knew the actual bar name, I didn't think of it at the time. Good point, I've edited the question body."
Frasier,33ug3b,MyNightmaresAreGreen,20,Sat Apr 25 19:04:35 2015 UTC,"Frasier is probably a better written show, it's faced paced, witty, and has a more dynamic range of filming locations. However, Cheers is still excellent and as a the precursor to Frasier you can see the evolution of Frasier's character and it is quite enjoyable.  Stick it out and watch Cheers by the end of the show you will wish there was more"
Frasier,33ug3b,thecheesefinder,11,Sat Apr 25 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"HUGE Frasier fan here. And I feel exactly the same as you do about Cheers. I really wanted to like it. Watched several episodes. It just fell short for me.  I could be wrong, but it may be more generational.  I watched Frasier in prime time.  I was a bit too young to do the same with Cheers."
Frasier,33ug3b,SheGivesGreatHelmet,8,Sat Apr 25 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"I've watched all of Frasier multiple times and all of Cheers... well, at least once. I watched both on DVD / Netflix, so there's no real generational issue for me.  I think a large part of whether you'll like one show or the other is simply what you're looking for. In Cheers most of the humor is derived simply from the entire show being about the random losers you would see at the same time every night, year after year, in any average neighborhood bar (the Applebee's joke nearly writes itself...).  That's the main reason I didn't enjoy it a whole lot - there was nothing to inspire me, it's as if all the characters have settled for this life and will never make anything more out of themselves. I've never enjoyed shows like that because there's never anything to learn (and the fact that we're glorifying being the butt of every ""average American"" joke ever is disappointing, everyone should want to improve themselves in some way).  Conversely, who hasn't watched Frasier and Niles being snooty about the one little imperfection in an expensive dinner (just the way they like it) and thought it would be nice to live that life, at least just a little? The nice suits, the fancy dinner parties, the expensive apartments, the German cars... It's what I've always enjoyed about the show because it's the kind of life I'd like to live eventually.  For me it basically boils down to be the premise of the episode where Woody comes to visit and Frasier can't stand to be around him after the first day because no one at Cheers has ""grown"" in the last 15 years... and never will."
Frasier,33ug3b,MellerTime,4,Sat Apr 25 20:20:00 2015 UTC,"I watched Frasier first, then watched Cheers. It is a slower and simpler show for the most part, but the final season when it focused on Norm, Woody, and Frasier is when I loved it the most. I didn't care for Diane, so I was glad when she left.  I loved having Cheers for the back story to Frasier, it makes all of the Lilith episodes much funnier when you know how and why they divorced."
Frasier,33ug3b,Jereso,7,Sat Apr 25 22:36:40 2015 UTC,"With Cheers, you really have to find the best season for you depending on which characters you like:   I don't really care for Coach, and he's replaced by Woody in Season 4.  While Frasier is introduced in Season 3, he isn't part of the recurring cast until Season 5.  I definitely like Shelly Long over Kirstie Alley, and they switch in Season 6.    So for me the sweet spot is Seasons 4 and 5 (although it admittedly gets a bit repetitive and formulaic by then)."
Frasier,33ug3b,octafed,5,Sat Apr 25 20:37:27 2015 UTC,"Coach was great in my opinion.   He wasn't replaced though. Nicholas Colasanto died during filming of season 3. He was honored since then by the Geronimo picture on the set.  Even though he died before the season ended, he was a part of phone gags as excusing his presence. Also they had already filmed certain cold openings and they still were used after his death.  However, he wasn't replaced. Woody succeeded him."
Frasier,33ug3b,droopyGT,2,Tue Apr 28 06:26:36 2015 UTC,"For those that don't know, the Geronimo picture was from Colasanto's dressing room, in which he hung it previous to his death."

Frasier's Cheers episodes were a bit strange because the two shows were so different, so the characters seem a bit out of place in Frasier's world. Frasier is totally a different person on Cheers too."
Frasier,33ug3b,greenspeek,2,Sat Apr 25 20:43:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's what put me off Cheers. I think I was expecting something similar to Frasier humor- and atmosphere-wise and when the show didn't deliver on that, I was disappointed."
Frasier,33ug3b,Sproose_Moose,3,Sun Apr 26 09:27:31 2015 UTC,"I enjoy cheers, not as much as Frasier of course, but I like the ensemble of characters. They work well together, make fun of each other and come together sometimes in harebrained schemes like in a lot of sitcoms.   The introduction of Frasier and seeing his change from the snooty, elitist (worse than on either show, he even had an almost faux-British accent) to a grizzled bar fly and then back to being happier after finally snaring Lilith.   If you watch Cheers, even just selected episodes you'll be able to get an even better look at Frasier and Lilith's relationship which makes the show worth it.  However, there is one episode with Frasier's mother in it and she was an old rich bitch who threatens to kill Dianne. Obviously they changed Hester's character a lot, but the fact she threatened to kill Dianne is still mentioned in Frasier."

Incidentally, this was also the creepiest episode, since he was dressed as a giant baby and almost had sex in a prop used for children's entertainment.  Can't recall my favorite Niles moment. Favorite minor character is Maris. I loved all the things Niles said about her and the excuses for why she couldn't do something or be somewhere.  I think the earlier episodes are funnier than the later ones. The last season was especially bizarre and too many things wrapped up."

Frasier,33pw36,Lor-Zod,4,Fri Apr 24 15:10:45 2015 UTC,"They used the Mid-Atlantic Accent in the show. Common in early cinema (think Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn), upper class Americans would learn and use it. They are using it for comedic effect and as a way to show their ""elite"" status is Seattle society, especially when you compare it to their father's accent.   In the English accent we all know, they pronounce prefixes more (think pro-gress instead of prog-ress). So since the accent is a blend of both English and American accents, the result is /ˈɛkskwɪzɪt/ instead of the more common American /ɪkˈskwɪzɪt/  Also one last note - Frasier went to Harvard and Harvard medOxford, while Niles went to Yale and Cambridge. So knowing that tidbit just adds to the background.  Edit: Apparently he went to Oxford. Thought so"

E- Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning (Eye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?

THANK YOU. to everyone who provided a thoughtful answer. I LOVE YOU and have your back for eternity.  Through reading these answers I conclude Frasier and family was NOT an alcoholic but enjoyed embibement.

Frasier,33kagv,C_Brooks11,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:02:51 2015 UTC,I don't think so. Alcoholism is about dependence; someone can drink a glass of brandy every day and still not be dependent on it. Although I have this recollection of an episode where Frasier got drunk and almost killed himself or tried to kill himself (I remember this from years ago) but I can't find it in any plot summary. Maybe it's just some kind of mental malfunction going on.

Frasier,31x8n4,JoelQ,17,Thu Apr 9 01:04:10 2015 UTC,"I was born in 1986 but as a television dork, I can tell you that in the 1984 Cheers episode ""rebound,"" Frasier was introduced as Diane's love interest, and therefore the rival in the whole Sam and Diane ""will they or won't they"" dynamic. Intended to appear for only a few episodes, ""Frasier Crane"" was supposed to be the antithesis of Sam. He was an intellectual egghead and the exact opposite of what repulsed Diane about Sam, her fellow barkeep. But audiences fucking loved Kelsey, the pretentious psychologist,  so his role expanded, naturally. Then when the beloved Cheers was cancelled, producers went with the next highest rated character and that's my opinion of why Fraser was born. This coming from a 29 year old guy who has watched all of this on youtube and has no idea what the fuck he's talking about."
Frasier,31x8n4,bondfool,6,Wed Apr 8 23:50:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, Kelsey so enjoyed appearing on Wings, he asked that show's producers to create a new show for him. At the time, he didn't want to keep playing Frasier, but Paramount didn't like the idea that the new show would be unconnected to the wildly successful Cheers, so they relented."
Frasier,31x8n4,droopyGT,4,Thu Apr 9 01:26:02 2015 UTC,"Kelsey won an Emmy for his appearance on Wings. You're right though, he didn't want the new series to be about the Frasier character and had to be talked into it. A lot of the reasons Frasier, the show, is the way it is stem from Kelsey's reservations about this. Another interesting fact is that the whole premise came from one of the writer's own experiences of having to care for his ailing father."

Frasier,31x8n4,K3R3G3,3,Thu Apr 9 11:39:55 2015 UTC,"It's in the first season. Episode three IIRC. Fun fact, the reason Frasier is set in Seattle is the producers worried the network would try to force a bunch of Cheers reunion episodes down their throats so they set the new show as far from Boston as possible. They sought to purposefully make it difficult to explain any Cheers characters popping in to Frasier's world. Which they still did later but not to the degree it could've gone."
Frasier,31x8n4,thucy,3,Thu Apr 9 15:21:03 2015 UTC,"Last night, I read an interesting fact about Cheers/Kelsey/Shelley(Diane):  ""Kelsey Grammer has said that ""The Show Where Diane Comes Back"" is one of his favorite episodes. On Cheers (1982), Shelley Long didn't like the Frasier character and lobbied hard to get Grammer removed from the show. The producers disagreed, noting that the audience liked him. When Long's character of ""Diane Chambers"" appeared on this show, Grammer said the episode was an opportunity for him and Long to make peace with each other."""

Many people think The Simpsons has been declining in quality for years, and that it's gone way beyond its lifespan. I would prefer to leave Frasier as is, where nearly every episode is awesome (and even so, the last few seasons are not as funny as the earlier ones) than to revive it and beat it into the ground."
Frasier,31x4wc,electrobolt,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:15:31 2015 UTC,I think part of that is when you have a lot of excellent past episodes people will ignore the rate of good new episodes is not changing and instead reflect that the newest one isn't as good as a past favorite.

I kinda felt like I was spending some time with three friends who know what it's like to suffer in love:  The Crane men look over the balcony at Seattle.  Frasier: Well, it's Saturday night.  And here we are... again.   Martin: Wonder how many women are out there tonight without a date.  Niles: Thousands!  Thousands of opportunities for us to humiliate ourselves.  Frasier: [shouting] Well, come and get us, Seattle!  Three Cranes, no waiting!  Martin: We're desperate!  Frasier: We're ludicrous!  Niles: We're pathetic!

And what is it about the emptiness that frightens you?  Roz: It's... lonely, for one thing.  Frasier: Have you always felt this way? Roz: For a while I didn't.  Frasier: What was different then?  Roz: I had somebody. A guy I really liked. And then we broke up... [breaks down crying] Oh God, Frasier. I miss him so much. I-I don't know how I fell in love again. I mean, I swore I wouldn't. I knew better. I should have known better! And then, sure enough, six months in, he tells me there's no fireworks. And what am I supposed to say? [sobs]  Frasier: I'm so sorry. But listen to me. You can't blame yourself for letting someone into your heart. Love is always a risk. But you have to take it. The pain you're feeling now will pass in time, and you'll find yourself ready to take that risk again. Until then... take comfort in your friends. They want to help you. They love you.

Frasier,31toa5,Darclite,2,Wed Apr 8 06:38:21 2015 UTC,"""Objectivity gives you emotional distance. Distance makes you feel safe""  That hit me pretty hard. My brain breaks down everything into an equation or a model and I view everything dreadfully objectively and I could never tell why. That's why."

Frasier,31toa5,elizabeth92,2,Wed Apr 8 13:26:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly I find whichever one makes me laugh the best. But do try and stay away from the ones where everyone is getting married and having breakfast and niles has a panic attack.    I literally just had my breakup as well (who knew that lying and cheating was something I'd actually dislike lol!).  Frasier will cure all, laugh.  But best yet, make your own life better.  Set your goals, get outside, the gym and exercise makes a huge difference to your mental and emotional state. Hell I even cried a little at the shoulder press. But I breathed and moved on to start becoming a better me.  So I signed up for a Spartan race in July, off to see my friends a little more, try some solo adventures like tree top trekking, indoor rock climbing, something to challenge yourself. And no hiking and walks won't help cause it's to much time in your head.    Give yourself the time to grieve. It is just that. Don't hate or be resentful. Enjoy the time you had together and learn from it. And FYI getting a lap dance at a strip club, doesn't hurt lol ;)   But don't jump into dating right away, it will only upset you further if you happen upon rejection or frustration.  Wow sorry for this being long, I just feel yeah bro.  Hang in there.  Make yourself the man who she would love to take back. Reject her and date someone prettier and healthier. ;)"
Frasier,31toa5,lbeezy13,2,Sat Apr 11 12:37:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you of that. My boyfriend and I aren't officially broken up, but I feel like we're on the cusp, after 7 years. We both love Frasier, but I introduced him to it. I've been watching a couple episodes every night since he left for ""work"" two months ago, and the familiarity of Frasier just seems to help the loneliness."
Frasier,31toa5,lbeezy13,2,Tue Apr 28 06:03:55 2015 UTC,"You know, even though a lot of people say this, the right framing sometimes puts it all in perspective. You sir, have found that, for me at least. I started running again and am thinking of joining a gym to do just that; I'm not letting her depict my luck nor my happiness.  You create your own well being. I think it's important to do this for oneself though. I've been through this once before in a different relationship and found out that after a while, when we where in a club and she tried to kiss me, I rejected her and had found a new love for myself. I think a lot of it has to do with self respect and confidence.  It has been 2 weeks now and even though I often catch myself checking her Facebook and re-reading old whatsapp messages, I see the opportunities that lie ahead.  Thank you so much for your long response and any excuses are unnecessary. Reading about another broken heart softens the pain and puts things into perspective. I hope you are doing well and are able to wake up and let what you have lost not be the first thing you think about. Take care!"

Do it anyways.  The gym has helped me a lot. Getting a hobby, support system, and something you love to do will also eat up free time. Sadly the more time spent in your head the worst it can be.  I won't bullshit you. I hear you when it comes to checking out her facebook, somehow still being a apart of her life and keeping tabs from afar. But it will prolong your pain and can make moving on that much more difficult.  But I can say I have checked my exes as well. Until I saw something that really hurt and then I have to say to myself. What did I expect?  She moved on, I am trying to but still holding on a little.   Turn the corner and make this year the better you you can be. As I say the gym does help a lot, doing weights makes me feel better. I'm still no where near a fit looking guy, maybe just low average. But I feel the the changes, and that's a lot!

Or, you know, maybe he sabotaged that relationship the same way he sabotaged all the other ones. Charlotte left him, and then he fell down the stairs, broke his hip and had to move in with Freddy.   I mean, I can kind of picture Freddy attending Harvard, having this smallish dorm, filled with Ikea furniture. And then there's Frasier's Eames recliner right in the middle of it, pointed at the TV. Grumpy old Frasier spends his days draped over the chair, sipping sherry, watching recordings of the Metropolitan Opera. Hilarity ensues as Freddy tries to shape his college experience around this giant obstacle planted right in the middle of his room..."

Frasier,31scea,JohnQuigley,9,Tue Apr 7 21:52:13 2015 UTC,"I hope for Martin's sake there is some Moon in there, so he can finally have a child in the family who plays catch! First Frasier, then Niles, then Freddy... somebody throw the guy a bone!   Even better would be if David is another ""little Niles,"" but then Niles and Daphne have a girl next, and she ends up being an athletic, non-nonsense, street smart sort of gal who never really gets along with her brother and her father, but is super close to Daphne & Martin. She turns down early acceptance to Princeton to join the FBI academy. The great turnaround is when she ends up getting a PhD in clinical forensic psychology... And from then on, it's Special Agent Evelyn Crane, FBI, bitches.   I want to write this show now. There is a show here... she can start investigating all of Matrin's old unsolved murders...

The relationship with Charlotte was still in the honeymoon phase when she moved to Chicago, plus she entered into the relationship at a moment of extreme emotional vulnerability. This is not a solid foundation for a relationship that you can extrapolate this settling-down scenario from. She's way too down-to-earth of a woman for Frasier. When she started having to deal with his ego and neuroses she'd split."

Frasier,31scea,JohnQuigley,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:38:01 2015 UTC,"Ego and selfishness are two different things. The whole series, from the first season on, dealt with Frasier's constant search for self-aggrandized validation of his own inflated self-image."

Frasier,31scea,JohnQuigley,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:51:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, shows have themes and internal consistency. It's not obsession so much as noticing trends in a show I've seen a lot of.   I remember hearing Brian Cranston talking about how he approaches his various roles and the psychology of the characters he plays, such as the father in Malcom in the Middle and Breaking Bad. Frasier was on for 11 seasons and one of the central focuses was on this one character, Frasier, and his personal struggles.   For me, that theme of ego, validation, and self-aggrandizement were the central to that character and the show, and one of the reasons that over the decade which the show represents he miserably fails at dating dozens upon dozens of women."

Not to be a jerk, but given the fact that Qapla' is arguably the most well-known Klingonese word in the quadrant (second only to the incendiary petaQ!) you'd think the writers could have done five minutes of research and gotten it right...

Interestingly, though, the writers did consult Marc Okrand - creator of the Klingon language - for the episode Star Mitzvah, where Frasier recites a speech in Klingon.

Does it lock automatically? Is it always unlocked? Sometimes you need keys, sometimes you don't? And the ability to shout something right in front of the door: most of the time the person in the hallway can't hear, but I'm pretty sure Lilith heard on one occasion (possibly a supernatural ability she possesses?)."
Frasier,31q7nj,incompl337,2,Wed Apr 8 08:57:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are many inconsistencies, but fortunately none of them truly matter or mess anything up for the show (that I recall.) It's one effect of watching the show often -- seeing the minor logical issues.  The door lock thing: I never paid much attention to that.  It could be one that's lockable from inside as one leaves. Or it could just be whatever is convenient at the time is what the show uses. On that note, that's pretty much the deal with the sound through the door. I brought this up and someone told me that it's a common stage technique where whatever works, works. (Being heard at normal volume, not being heard at normal volume, whispering to not be heard, yelling and still not being heard.) Frasier is a very theatrical sitcom and they use this technique/device because, in an actual stage production, you'd always be able to hear what's on the other side of the door. Whatever the scene calls for, those are the conditions assumed, on an episode-to-episode basis."

Here's a damn wild and interesting one I just learned:  Kelsey Grammer used an acting method that he called ""requisite disrespect"". He would rehearse each scene only once and he would not learn his lines until moments before each scene was shot. Grammer felt that his method brought energy and realism to his performance. The cast and crew got used to it but guest stars did not like his method.  I have even more respect for his skills now."

And what did I watch during the commercials of the movie: Top Gear and guess what, they drive past that exact statue. Today I also went to the supermarket. The lady in front of me forgot to pack one of her items and I ran after her to give it to her, she already was in her car and I kinda startled her a bit, but she was thankful. I then proceeded on my bicycle to the citycentre to another store and who is standing next to me at the counter? The same lady, of all the hundreths of stores she is there.

He sees his own circle as understanding taste and class and the other circle as awaiting enlightenment, lost in a sea of their own lack of knowledge. While he has often talked with relish of the ""peasant cultures"" of other countries, when it's his own he is lost. So he walks up to a stranger in a rest stop and comes out with a line akin to ""I'd like to study you because you're different"" and gets an answer which goes against his world view.

I love Bulldog, Gil, Kenny, Bebe (who is a disliked character from what I've seen), and Lilith, but Noel is irredeemable.  I know everything he does is for laughs but his overall behavior, and especially his creepiness toward Roz is very annoying. Of course I have no quarrel with wonderful Patrick Kerr, in fact it's very admirable that he made the Noel character so believably despicable."

Frasier,2zxon1,_sundry,4,Mon Mar 23 04:01:08 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily prefer Mel to Daphne... but I really enjoyed it whenever Mel was around.   I thought that everyone was really hard on Mel for no reason. She was basically a female version of Niles, if Niles had more confidence and less substance. Mel was smart, sophisticated, successful, stylish and pretty. And loyal. She wasn't the devil everyone made her out to be.    What Niles did to her was really shitty. And Frasier was unfair to her from the get-go. To be honest, I actually enjoyed it when she made their lives hell later on. Eventually she went too far, and Niles was right to put an end to it. But for awhile there... hell, I was cheering her on."
Frasier,2zxon1,busydoinnothin,2,Mon Mar 23 04:17:19 2015 UTC,"I liked Mel too, however everyone had their reason to dislike her.  Always demanding things from Daphne because she was 'the help', she worked for Martin/Frasier, not Mel.  Putting the idea into Niles' head to be corkmaster undermining Frasier's efforts? You realize this was in the very beginning of their relationship, this is the moment Frasier stopped liking her."
Frasier,2zxon1,Crheine,4,Tue Mar 24 22:23:18 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, Frasier disliked her the minute he found out she had a reserved table on the terrace at chez Henri.   ""Oh, well, I guess you have to know the owner.""   Frasier looked like he'd eaten a bad clam."

Frasier,2zxon1,K3R3G3,3,Mon Mar 23 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"While David Hyde Pierce is probably the best part of the show, he doesn't do very well in more serious moments and has no chemistry with Jane Leeves. And not just because Daphne turns into a fairly unpleasant person after they get together.  The episode with the politician who thinks he was kidnapped by aliens is terrible.  I know it's not a particularly popular thing anyway, but the way Donny's character was handled after things fell apart was remarkably terrible. Don't know what the writers were thinking.  Martin's nostalgia for older values isn't commendable or charming, it's a flawed perspective and it's written rather unevenly and inconsistently."
Frasier,2zxon1,craneiyum,2,Thu Mar 26 06:21:33 2015 UTC,I hate the Valentine's Day episode with the three different scenarios.
Frasier,2zxon1,K3R3G3,14,Sun Mar 22 22:05:11 2015 UTC,The Niles segment is one of my favourite scenes in the whole series! I love that it relays so much emotion without words.

It's like if there were a Marx Brothers skit with only Zeppo.    Are we to assume that this part of the episode never actually happens?  It's never mentioned later that Niles burns Frasier's couch, the couch appears completely fine in following episodes.  Frasier's story line from this episode is continued though,  ""Frasier: When a Man Loves Two Women (#6.21)"" (1999)  Frasier: Say, Dad, you remember that woman I went out with on Valentine's Day but I wasn't quite sure if it was a romantic thing?

While Pierce is a great actor, including physical comedy, I just don't find it that funny at all. It's just overkill, I guess...too much stuff occurring consecutively."

The Alice storyline was great, but more episodes should've included the father. He wanted to be involved but Roz shut him out."

The x-ray shows her chest/lungs and was likely a follow-up appointment well after the initial diagnosis. This is what I always figured and it is in the wiki article posted by /u/stinktiere as well as this one for the minor characters. One could guess maybe it was breast cancer, but I don't think that's possible because, in the image, the breast is not flattened as is required in a mammogram. Additionally, I believe the x-ray would be focused on the breast in that scenario and there are many other diagnostic methods to determine and montior breast cancer. If you look at the screenshot, it does appear there is some mass on one side and not the other which I figured was supposed to be the tumor. I don't believe there is evidence for anything else in the series so lung cancer seems to be the only logical conclusion.  TL;DR - A5: lung cancer"

Frasier,2zsdqw,Stinktiere,6,Sat Mar 21 16:23:13 2015 UTC,I always thought it was lung cancer that;s what I put in the trivia quiz just now.  A quick check on the frasier wiki says lung cancer but doesn't explain why : http://frasier.wikia.com/wiki/Hester_Crane
Frasier,2zsdqw,autowikiabot,5,Sat Mar 21 08:37:36 2015 UTC,"Hester Crane (from Frasier wikia):       Dr. Hester Rose Crane (nee Palmer) was the wife of Martin Crane and mother of Frasier Crane and Niles Crane. Like her two sons, Hester was a psychiatrist. She met Martin over the outline of a body, as she was called by the Seattle Police Department to create a profile for a murder suspect. In Odd Man Out, Martin mentions that she commemorated the occasion on their anniversaries by baking gingerbread men shaped like the outline (Frasier and Niles thought they were dancing). She had an affair when her children were young, one summer at the lake. Though it was tough on their marriage, they were able to get past it and ultimately spend 30 years together before she died of lung cancer. It was revealed in Are You Being Served that she named her sons after two lab rats she observed while she was pregnant with Frasier. She was first seen on Cheers in 1984, played by Nancy Marchand, where she tried to break the relationship between Diane Chambers and Frasier. She died three years later in 1987, during the timeline of Cheers. Although her exact cause of death was never stated, a flashback Martin has implied she died from Lung Cancer. She died only two years before the birth of her and Martin's first grandchild, Frederick. A younger version of her appeared on Frasier in Momma Mia when Frasier dated a woman who looked very similar to her, and later in a dream sequence in Don Juan in Hell. On Frasier (Television series), she was played by Rita Wilson. Interesting: Niles Crane | Zora Crane | Walt Crane | David Crane    Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Here is a picture:  http://i.imgur.com/vlma1be.png  From this, I think a reasonable assumption is breast cancer. But I'd love it if somebody could find an actual mention of it somewhere."

Was this the name of the woman who drives a Bentley?   EDIT: I looked it up. Mitsy Gill.   And I can't sleep so I did some research on that car accident...   The accident where Frasier ends up in the hospital is from the episode ""The Late Doctor Crane."" Niles is riding shotgun and he complains that the car is too cold. Frasier tells him to put on some gloves, ""They're in the glove compartment.""   ""Oh really? I thought that's where you kept the butter and the eggs.""   Niles turns up the heat and Frasier, lamenting that now he's too warm, tries to remove his jacket while the car is still in motion. He rear-ends another vehicle and the airbags deploy just as Niles' hand is in the way.   Niles: ""Are you alright?""   Frasier: ""Yes. Thank heavens your fist softened the blow of the airbag.""   So there is the context. Anyway, now I'm sitting here watching the whole episode. It's the one where Niles meets Mel. It's so adorable.   Mel (donning a fresh white lab coat and tossing the smudged one in the trash): ""You must think I'm terribly fussy.""   Niles (voice quivering, weak at the knees with lust): ""Yes."""

We get an owl to eat the gecko? Then we get a tiger to eat the owl? What eats the tiger, Dad? Tell me that.  The second one. Frasier and Martin hunting the cricket with the Gecko. Frasier: It's asleep, Dad. Martin: No, it's not. Frasier: Really? He hasn't twitched his tail for two minutes. Martin: That's because he's lulling him into a false sense of security.

I take that back, the cop lady Frasier was interested in that ends up dating Martin appeared twice - the second being the episode that introduced Sherry.

She could assume it's just a lame excuse,  but a few moments later, he barges into Annie's room while she's naked and explicitly says he did it because he thought Annie was ""hot for him.""   I guess you could take the line that Daphne assumed Annie was his second choice after she ""rejected"" him, though.  Edit: But then again, Frasier was sending obvious signals all night to Annie, and none to Daphne, and it seems like she'd pick up on that and believe his ""wrong room"" excuse.

Frasier,2yc8a8,DoctorSteve,2,Mon Mar 9 02:01:24 2015 UTC,"Beloved Infidel from S1 was another really good episode that was actually very serious for a Frasier episode that was all about Martin. I can honestly say I like Martin the most out of all the characters in the show and he truly was a person I feel more people should strive to be like. My only complaint with him is I lost a little respect for him in that episode where he's tapping that widow of his buddy, The guy was not even buried yet and he was already in the door... I mean what the fuck!?"

Frasier,2y9lit,At-Amber,3,Sat Mar 7 19:31:38 2015 UTC,"That's brilliant, I can relate to that."
Frasier,2y9lit,K3R3G3,2,Sat Mar 7 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"I have an issue with this article: I don't believe Frasier was actually envious of Niles' getting together with Daphne. Envy is often displayed between them, but for social status, positions of influence, accolades, and antiques. I don't recall seeing any jealousy from Frasier, nor the standard flaunting from Niles that would occur in such a situation.   The only thing I could think of which could possibly be misconstrued as envy is Frasier's frustration with Niles and Daphne's ""honeymoon"" period in which they were very affectionate, Niles always talking about their activities, their website with photos of them (haha, Facebook), and his t-shirt with their photo inside a big heart. I believe Frasier was just sick of hearing about it much like how everyone was when Roz was doing the same regarding her relationship with Roger.  Also, the line “I hope one day to love a woman the way you love Daphne"" is actually said when Frasier expresses concern over Daphne's weight gain and Niles is unable to see it. Later on, it is revealed that the reason he didn't see the weight gain wasn't deep love, but because he kept an idealized image of her in his mind since he was first smitten by her upon their first meeting. This ended up being detrimental to their relationship and had to be overcome before they would become ready to sleep together. (Still, I'm not saying Frasier didn't want to be in love - of course he did. It's just an odd quote to cite as evidence for jealousy since that clearly wasn't the motivator for those words.)  I believe Frasier was actually very happy for them. He even says so explicitly. Also recall how he played a major part in getting them together. He told Niles how Daphne felt about him the night before her scheduled wedding to Donny. Frasier's actions split up one marriage and canceled another in order to get them together, which he knew was best for them. He saw them on the dance floor and couldn't sit idly by. Frasier even came near to suffering a vicious lawsuit due to his actions. If all this was to bring him envy of something he'd have to see day after day with his frequent encounters of Daphne and his brother, he may not have set it in motion and I'm sure we'd have very often seen his frustration and heard the verbal manifestations of it in the form of his sharp insults."
Frasier,2y9bbr,K3R3G3,5,Sat Mar 7 18:02:48 2015 UTC,"He didn't like the toreador painting Martin had bought him (by Cordoba).

The others just don't have enough pull to write an entire show about them.

Frasier,2xqy2i,Twiggy3,2,Tue Mar 3 23:39:47 2015 UTC,"Remember that Jane was coached on set to speak with such high pitch and the Manchurian accent, and if you watched any interviews or talk shows, her real voice is somewhere between Daphne's (almost whiny) high pitch and her fake American baritone ""suuuuuuure"" voice.  I agree, it does sound odd in that scene because she switches quickly, but I think it's all her."
Frasier,2xqy2i,MacGyver_Survivor,1 point,Wed Mar 4 14:00:06 2015 UTC,Unfortunately her accent was nothing like a Mancunian one.
Frasier,2xqy2i,droopyGT,2,Wed Mar 11 09:14:21 2015 UTC,"I reckon it would be her. It sounds different because it's lower than Jane's normal speaking range, while Daphne's voice is higher than her normal range. Sounds a bit bassy and breathier, as though they kept the same sound mix for both voices, so the difference is really noticeable and sounds punched-in in post.  Take a look at Helena Bonham-Carter's high pitched British accent in many roles compared to her deeper American accent in Fight Club. Very similar."

I mean, less ""sexy"" men. If I had to choose, I guess Noel Shempsky... jk! Though, he would be loads of fun to have as company for maybe a comic con. Probably Nikos Crane since I recently saw that episode and thought he was pretty decent. Also, definitely Niles but I can't get over the fact that David Hype Pierce is gay. It makes him less ""I wanna throw you on the bed"", more... I want to just hang out with you and talk about opera.   2) Niles Crane.  3) Ham Radio.

It's a great all around episode, the first scene ends in Bulldog saying ""I got to stop by my mom's house, I owe her 50 bucks and a case of Schlitz"" and goes right into the second scene opening with Niles hand-washing balloons. The caller that thinks his radio is talking to him. Full of great little jokes and scenes like those (""...and have bail appear on my statement?""), not to mention the scene with Martin, Frasier, and the transvestite hooker: ""It's ok Crystal, these things happen.""

Frasier,2x351c,thecheesefinder,4,Thu Feb 26 20:02:41 2015 UTC,What I never understood about that episode and the other Cheers guest episodes after I started thinking about it was they reacted like they had not seen Frasier even once since he left. Frasier states numerous times throughout the show that in addition to his son coming to Seattle to visit him he makes trips out to Boston to see him. You're telling me he made all of these Boston trips throughout the years and not even once did the man poke his head into Cheers to say hello? I realize his main visit was always to see his son of course but as he put it himself those people were an integral part of his past and that seems kinda low to not even make one effort in his many trips to at least stop in for a quick visit.
Frasier,2x351c,Axadarm,2,Sat Feb 28 01:34:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. Surely he would have had an opportunity to pop into cheers.

I guess it would have been difficult to recreate that set but I can only imagine how incredible a feeling it would have been to reunite the cast in the bar.  I get the feeling the producers wanted to do something like that for Cliff's retirement party but obviously were unable.  Still, that would have been so incredible"
Frasier,2x351c,Crheine,1 point,Sun Mar 1 07:30:27 2015 UTC,"I'm probably just looking into it too much. I hope so anyway, as Frasier reverted back to his snobby ways after returning to Seattle but I'd hate to think it got him to the point where he didn't even try to visit the bar even once in the 11 years since he left."
Frasier,2x351c,Axadarm,1 point,Sun Mar 1 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"From personal experiences I know that when I visit home, which is seldom, it's tough to make some trips and get people all together.  You got Carla with all her kids and could be out of work and the bar business runs at strange hours.  I could see it be that he may have seen Sam but woody was out etc.  But his snobby behavior could also play a role."
Frasier,2x351c,Crheine,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:44:39 2015 UTC,It's not outright stated he never has but I thought it implied he pretty much had never seen them since then. This is also supported in the Sam and Woody episodes where Frasier inquires about the place every time one of them visits. The only instance I recall Frasier reaching out to any of them was in the episode where he has 3 dates and calls Norm to brag about it.

Frasier,2x351c,Axadarm,2,Wed Feb 25 20:52:16 2015 UTC,"I just saw the two- or three-part episode that dealt with Niles having heart surgery (2002). Don't know if it's underrated, but I thought it was a great episode - particularly the part where Niles was being wheeled down the hospital corridor and we saw moments from the past when he, Martin, and Frasier were at the hospital.  It was moving for me, because I could really relate to that.  Edit: I also really like ""Don Juan In Hell"" - the episode where Frasier is interacting with visions of his old girlfriends. That's another fantastic episode.  Are there any bad Frasier episodes? I have yet to see one."
Frasier,2x351c,droopyGT,2,Thu Feb 26 15:54:25 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say any bad ones though I'm in the crowd that prefer to watch the first half of the show's seasons opposite the second half when Niles and Daphne are together.

Either there was an uncredited person in the bed, or ""Maris"" in said scene was just bandages wrapped around a mannequin or something.  But to get to the original point, they considered casting Maris before they made her way too grotesque to be played by a real actress, and I've given it some thought.  In Ask Me No Questions, there's a decoy character who enters Cafe Nervosa just as Frasier welcomes Marta, to give the audience a wrong impression that she's Maris. Short, pale, thin and blonde. She must be somewhat close to the vision of Maris in the show creators' mind for the decoy joke to work. Perhaps Kristin Chenoweth (the lovely actress who played Bebe's junior agent) could work with brutal training to become thin, VERY thin, and extensive powdering to make her Caucasian, VERY Caucasian.  Or, to go completely against the unseen character trope, they could show Maris once or twice a season, and always cast different actresses to emphasize her obsession with cosmetic surgery."
Frasier,2x18hm,besyuziki,5,Tue Feb 24 23:16:42 2015 UTC,"I like the last idea, that's clever. She would be dressed differently and completely unrecognizable every time and that would be the gag."

Friends was so tired after 10 years, the same old gags, it was just repetitive. all they could do was rehash the same character points, Monica's fussy, Ross has been divorced several times, Phoebe says ditzy things etc etc  But then Frasier kept going to new places right up to the end."

Something snaps in Niles' brain and he broods by day but does his usual routine, still sees his patients and attends the opera, but is an ultra violent super villain by night.  Because he can't resist a good mystery, Marty plays amateur detective and joins in on the active police case, pumping friends for details and information who are still on the police force. Niles is clever enough to throw enough clues to keep Marty temporarily off the trail, but Frasier can see it in his brother's eyes and his mentality, but refuses to allow himself to believe it, and is torn in being a good brother, a good psychiatrist and a good citizen."

Then she marries him and he cheats on her and leaves her for Daphne, who knew she had a crush on him well before his marriage/her wedding.

I remember that because when I watched it, I actually looked it up to see who was right. They were both wrong. It's played in several keys.

Fraiser hears the shatter and asks, ""Anne Boleyn?"" and Niles shouts back ""Catherine of Aragon!"" See, that was a was a subtle historical joke since Henry the VIII was infatuated with Anne Boleyn and dissatisfied with his cold marriage to Catherine of Aragon.

Also, dialogue from ""Enemy at the Gate"" (Season 10):  Frasier: ""My income, and the style of car which I drive, are irrelevant! Isn't that so, Niles?""  Niles: ""Yes, I drive a Mercedes, and I would have paid ten minutes ago.""  Edit (addition): While watching last night, I saw another example. In the ""Adventures of Bad Boy and Dirty Girl"" episode:  Niles: ""I listened to your programme as I was driving home last night.           [holds up two pieces of paper] Here's a bill to replace the           front wheel of my Mercedes, and the second to replace the back           bumper of some wretched little domestic car."""

Frasier,2vs11z,lozzie87,3,Fri Feb 13 22:15:32 2015 UTC,"I believe Frasier was calling an independent cleaner, not getting cleaning done at the dealership. Otherwise, it'd be redundant to say he needed his BMW cleaned if they were a BMW dealership. That's just my opinion on the matter, but the main matter being questioned:   Frasier always had a BMW 5 series (a 540i and possibly a 525i was shown/used for taping once or twice...he went from an E34 to an E39) then a 7-series (745Li, E65) (always black for all) in the later seasons. You guys gotta trust me here because I know BMWs (and Mercedes) well. The only car Niles ever mentioned having (other than that red hatchback in a couple episodes before he got his settlement via Donny Douglass) was a Mercedes. He mentioned the E320 in 'Seat of Power' then all other instances of mentioning were just the make, not the specific model. Always Mercedes. He never mentions another brand.   It was part of their duality: Frasier - Freud...Niles - Jung, Frasier - BMW...Niles - Mercedes, Frasier - Harvard/Oxford...Niles - Yale/Cambridge, and so on. They chose different things that were actually very similar (psychological schools of thought/role models, German luxury sedans, elite universities, etc.)"

Every time I think I know the characters like the back of my hand, there's always a new element or depth of development that totally escaped me the whole time.

Never argued that Niles did NOT own a Mercedes at one point (Seat of Power episode), just thought he may have owned a BMW at one point as well."

Frasier,2vnu6l,Crheine,10,Thu Feb 12 16:03:53 2015 UTC,I agree. Especially as Frasier did all the invites and made that phonecall: He is the more socially aggressive of the two. Niles is just too timid and awkward. He's still awesome though.:-)
Frasier,2vnu6l,falc0nwing,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:25:01 2015 UTC,Especially as Frasier did all the invites   Niles was the one that invited that particular couple.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekTxI4hReE4 Around 2 min.  But I also think it depends on whoever was first friends with that couple.

Frasier,2vnu6l,obsessivelyfoldpaper,3,Fri Feb 13 00:19:19 2015 UTC,Does this include numerous weird allergies and a profound love for PT'S named Daphne Moon? ;-)
Frasier,2vnu6l,falc0nwing,1 point,Fri Feb 13 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"He's smart, clean, a little silly and definitely a romantic. Plus who wouldn't love Daphne, she is ""a goddess""."

Frasier,2vmlo2,Crheine,11,Thu Feb 12 06:22:13 2015 UTC,"In cheers Frasier just seems overall more of an average man than he does in Frasier. He's gutsier, more down to earth, and more knowledgeable about ""normal"" things most men would know.  In Frasier, he's more sissy-ish, more stereotypically rich and snooty, and seems to be out of touch with everything his father knows and likes, despite having been much more like his father in Cheers.  If someone gave me a list of Frasier quotes throughout both series, I'd probably be able to guess which series he said it in with pretty fair accuracy."
Frasier,2vmlo2,Ayesuku,11,Thu Feb 12 17:02:49 2015 UTC,The quote is an interesting idea.  I might see what I can find and maybe post a little quiz :)
Frasier,2vmlo2,Twiggy3,12,Thu Feb 12 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"Wearing a similar hat in Cheers to the type he mocks Niles for wearing.  Ordering white wine Spritzers on Cheers, which he would be disgusted by as Frasier Frasier."
Frasier,2vmlo2,Jszanko,9,Thu Feb 12 09:44:11 2015 UTC,"Yea his drinking tastes are much different.  I remember him with a beer glass a few times.  He'd never drink a beer.  ""I'm getting a beer.  Anyone else want one?""-Martin.  ""just you."" -  Frasier"
Frasier,2vmlo2,kidmuaddib3,12,Thu Feb 12 11:11:59 2015 UTC,I think being around Niles has changed his drinking habits.
Frasier,2vmlo2,K3R3G3,7,Thu Feb 12 11:20:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I can totally see that.  Niles is way more stuffy in the beginning and think it had an influence in him for sure.
Frasier,2vmlo2,l23r,13,Thu Feb 12 11:28:09 2015 UTC,"It makes sense to me that he reinforces ""refined"" tastes in an attempt to distance himself from Martin. A flashback indicates he and Niles were used to drinking scotch together before Martin moves in. He also happily reverts to beer in more tender moments with his father."
Frasier,2vmlo2,sublimesam,6,Thu Feb 12 13:38:25 2015 UTC,"Also, when Frasier initially arrives in Seattle, he states that a black coffee is plenty good enough for him. Then, throughout the series, it's always lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, etc."
Frasier,2vmlo2,Jszanko,6,Fri Feb 13 16:50:14 2015 UTC,You would think that a psychiatrist would be more self-aware of things like that...
Frasier,2vmlo2,mhoner,6,Thu Feb 12 20:42:36 2015 UTC,"Not only that but realistically what happens when you pick yourself up and move to a new city, it allows you to get reacquainted with yourself. When you've been living in one place for a long time, you tend to get in the habit of just doing things because you hang around with a certain social circle, even if those aren't things that appeal to the true ""you."" When you pick up, move somewhere, and start over, you get to rediscover your own preferences, etc."
Frasier,2vmlo2,Spinetablet,2,Thu Feb 12 17:30:45 2015 UTC,Exactly. Back in Boston he was hanging out with blue collar guys in a neighborhood back. A bostonian McGinty's if you will.  He probably tailored his drinking habits around his company.
Frasier,2vmlo2,Spinetablet,11,Tue Feb 17 22:47:17 2015 UTC,They touched on that in a flashback at one point. It was the same with the coffee.  He chided Niles at first for such lavish taste in coffee.
Frasier,2vmlo2,Twiggy3,4,Thu Feb 12 18:29:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I think I remember he ordered a black coffee and said he hopes he doesn't get so pretentious that black coffee wasn't good enough :)
Frasier,2vmlo2,Twiggy3,7,Fri Feb 13 03:47:23 2015 UTC,"He drew a gun on Sam. You can't imagine him doing anything else quite like that. But this was season 3-4 stuff, of course he was going through changes.  Also, I don't think he likes Eddie because he stares at him."
Frasier,2vmlo2,Twiggy3,15,Thu Feb 12 11:03:58 2015 UTC,Could have been teaching Sam an etiquette lesson.
Frasier,2vmlo2,Spinetablet,4,Thu Feb 12 11:14:54 2015 UTC,"""You see Sam, one always holds a pistol with the thumb raised and the finger only slightly poised on the trigger"""

Frasier,2vmlo2,BigTall81,6,Thu Feb 12 14:27:03 2015 UTC,That's a good example of something I couldn't quite put into words before.  Erratic and goofy come to mind when describing Cheers Frasier too.
Frasier,2vmlo2,Stinktiere,2,Thu Feb 12 11:32:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, they really liked pulling guns on Cheers"
Frasier,2vmlo2,gethighbeforyoudie,4,Thu Feb 12 13:11:05 2015 UTC,Niles did have that starters pistol.
Frasier,2vmlo2,droopyGT,3,Thu Feb 12 14:01:20 2015 UTC,That's true.  Even Frasier's mother.
Frasier,2vmlo2,gethighbeforyoudie,3,Thu Feb 12 13:22:22 2015 UTC,I think Andy Andy had a gun. And what about the time Sam shot himself in the ass? And then there was Lilith's pod boyfriend.
Frasier,2vmlo2,cherieblosum,6,Thu Feb 12 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"Cheers Frasier liked sports, especially baseball. Frasier Frasier detests them.  I really think Cheers Frasier was a phase in his life where he tried to be more down to earth and average, and moving back to Seattle made him revert to his snooty self, triggered by his reacquantance with Niles"
Frasier,2vlbql,sublimesam,4,Wed Feb 11 23:27:40 2015 UTC,"It's been more than 20 years, and it's still the ideal response to people who just HAVE TO show off with their so-called problems."
Frasier,2vlbql,besyuziki,3,Wed Feb 11 23:50:19 2015 UTC,I pick an episode at random every night to watch before I go to sleep. What a weird coincidence that this is the very episode I am watching right this second!

Now, this microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons you can actually see images of the atom, the infinitesimally minute building blocks of our universe. Sappy16, if I were using that microscope right now, I still wouldn't be able to locate my interest in your coincidence."
Frasier,2vlbql,neszero,2,Thu Feb 12 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"I used to do random episodes before bed, then it got difficult to keep track of which one's I'd watched recently. Now I just watch the series sequentially and when I finish, start over again."
Frasier,2vlbql,__charles,3,Thu Feb 12 23:43:33 2015 UTC,That quote isn't done justice when read. It needs to be delivered by Mr. Grammer himself.

Eileen: Dr. Crane, I've been very happily married for twenty years and I wouldn't dream of cheating, but lately when we're  making love I find myself fantasizing about people... other than my husband.  Frasier: Well, that's perfectly normal.  It's quite normal to spice up           one's love life by imagining a tryst with, oh, a sports figure           or a movie star or...  Eileen: Or a radio psychiatrist?  Frasier: Excuse me?  Eileen: It's your voice, Dr. Crane.  You must have the most sensuous           voice on earth.  Frasier: [putting on a sensuous voice:] Oh, I don't know, Eileen.  Eileen: I've never seen your picture.  Would you mind describing           yourself?  Frasier: Oh, well I don't really think that's appropriate...  Roz: I'll do it.   Frasier: Roz, I don't think...  Roz: He's about six-one, with a granite jaw and the broad shoulders           of a marine.  He's been wearing his hair short lately but that           only accentuates his cobalt blue eyes, his chiseled cheekbones           and his full, provocative lips.  Eileen: Wow!  Thanks Roz, and thank you, Dr. Crane.  I'll be thinking           of you tonight - with any luck, twice!

Frasier,2vieps,sarah_cate1,5,Wed Feb 11 07:08:12 2015 UTC,Frasier was just a little too snobby and arrogant for my tastes. Niles was/is the better version of Frasier;if a little accident prone.
Frasier,2vieps,yaffamay,5,Wed Feb 11 17:43:52 2015 UTC,"He has a damn great career, a lot of money and an awesome apartment. Women always tend to date down in terms of looks so him dating beautiful women isn't really a stretch."
Frasier,2vieps,Pinklego,3,Wed Feb 11 20:07:32 2015 UTC,I guess I'm in the minority but I totally find Frasier attractive. I do find his voice suave and I'm attracted to guys with a stockier build.  Niles not so much but I do find him adorable like I would a puppy.
Frasier,2vieps,Britt_Solo,7,Wed Feb 11 22:23:07 2015 UTC,No. Kelsey's got weird features like thin lips and that fucking forehead. He had ungodly hair in season one and after a few seasons his mannerisms just came off as annoying and absurd. Also in his divorce to Camille he came off as an insensitive prick. Plus this photo:
Frasier,2vieps,RazzleThemAll,4,Wed Feb 11 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"I'd probably go out with him but he's not like ""eye candy."""
Frasier,2vieps,squishymarshmallows,2,Wed Feb 11 18:07:40 2015 UTC,Nope!   Certain episodes his facial expressions makes him look like BP Richfield and Earl Sinclair from Dinosaurs.
Frasier,2vieps,Twiggy3,2,Wed Feb 11 18:34:40 2015 UTC,makes him look like BP Richfield and Earl Sinclair from Dinosaurs.   This is easily the best comment in the thread.
Frasier,2vieps,Tabby888,2,Thu Feb 12 23:58:39 2015 UTC,"Nope, not attractive to me. Niles, on the other hand..particularly when he is shown wearing his cream linen trousers and rumpled shirt...I think it's because he is normally so buttoned up, and to see him relaxed in casual wear is attractive. Also his cricket whites...swoon! I never could resist a man with a floppy fringe wearing a crumpled white shirt!!"
Frasier,2vdc8s,sublimesam,12,Tue Feb 10 01:55:49 2015 UTC,One of my favorite parts of this show is how much of a jerkass fraiser can be.
Frasier,2vdc8s,BeforeTheRobots,12,Tue Feb 10 04:39:44 2015 UTC,my favorite example of this is when Frasier recorded the 1940s style murder mystery on the radio.
Frasier,2vdc8s,politicaldan,3,Tue Feb 10 05:37:57 2015 UTC,I don't think he's actually being a jerk here. I think for him it's a true case of cognitive dissonance.

Frasier,2v5g1h,Natrino,10,Sun Feb 8 04:45:14 2015 UTC,I think it was funnier the second time I saw it. Specially the first few seasons I got a few jokes I did not get the first time
Frasier,2v5g1h,Drusss,12,Sun Feb 8 09:44:06 2015 UTC,I found this out when it came out on Netflix. I watched it when it was on air and found it hysterical. But watching it older...good god. Even better in my opinion. SO many references flew right over my head during my teenage years. I've watched the series far too many times to count. It's like a fine wine; better with age. The Crane boys would approve.
Frasier,2v5g1h,bowa,3,Sun Feb 8 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better , that is exactly what I went through. I just appreciated it a lot more the 2nd time out"
Frasier,2v5g1h,Drusss,4,Mon Feb 9 05:40:52 2015 UTC,It's amazing how much you forget from the first seasons once you restart! I'm due for a rewatch myself :-)
Frasier,2v5g1h,TurboDisturbo,12,Sun Feb 8 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"If you really like David Hyde Pierce then check out The Perfect Host, it's available on Netflix. He plays an entirely different character than Niles. But he's a really talented actor and (IMO) it's cool to see someone so deeply associated with one character play a completely different one. Plus the movie is really good."
Frasier,2v5g1h,RealCraftyGuy,6,Sun Feb 8 02:29:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm I just might.  Thank you!  Yes, he is a very good actor and I would enjoy seeing more of his work.  Huge fan of Mr. Pierce."
Frasier,2v5g1h,squishymarshmallows,3,Sun Feb 8 02:36:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, and if you want more of Kelsey Grammer then check out Boss (also available on Netflix). Again, that's an entirely different character than Frasier. And the show is pretty good but not spectacular IMO; 4 out of 5 stars."
Frasier,2v5g1h,itsaboat,2,Sun Feb 8 03:08:12 2015 UTC,I saw Boss.  It was a very good performance by him.
Frasier,2v5g1h,casentlacoupe,2,Sun Feb 8 03:52:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely enjoyed it. But I didn't think it was Frasier-level or anything."
Frasier,2v5g1h,itsaboat,7,Sun Feb 8 03:54:33 2015 UTC,"I also just recently finished watching the entire series on Netflix.  It truly is a marvel of a show with a timeless humor and a classy vibe.  One of the few shows I've seen where all the main characters are enjoyable to watch, and are talented performers.  Although, I was fairly disappointed with how it ended.  Part of me wished Frasier had remained in Seattle or rekindled with Lilith since some episodes sure seemed to strongly hint at this possibility.  But alas, all good things come to an end..."
Frasier,2v5g1h,bender445,7,Sun Feb 8 07:21:36 2015 UTC,"I re-watch episodes all the time but I favour the earlier ones before daphne and niles get together, and I can't watch the last Ep because it feels like I'm losing my friends.  Tldr I'm a bit pathetic and generally available on Friday nights at short notice"
Frasier,2v5g1h,sublimesam,5,Sun Feb 8 12:44:33 2015 UTC,"If you haven't watched Cheers, give it try.   *Spoiler*  Frasier doesn't show up until the 3rd season  But it's a great show on its own and it will fill you in on all of the inside jokes. The episodes with former Cheers cast members will make a lot more sense too."
Frasier,2v5g1h,17Hongo,2,Sun Feb 8 16:18:39 2015 UTC,I tried Cheers after I finished Frasier. I couldn't do it. It was too different.  It's like watching the MAS*H movie after finally finishing the entire series. I couldn't do it because the characters were played by different actors.
Frasier,2v5g1h,setmehigh,2,Mon Feb 9 02:35:50 2015 UTC,That's too bad. I really liked Cheers. It was cool seeing how Frasier started and what he went through. I think it's a good show on its own.
Frasier,2v5g1h,TheWorstNL,4,Mon Feb 9 02:45:34 2015 UTC,"I don't have much to add except yes, you said it!"
Frasier,2v5g1h,Axadarm,4,Sun Feb 8 17:26:53 2015 UTC,And I would like to say that Niles was my absolute favorite.   There's really no contest in my book. By far the best character.
Frasier,2v6cv8,bitcoinfan87,4,Sun Feb 8 08:04:23 2015 UTC,"Is it the one where he transitions into it from a calm classical piece and back to classical before his family members come in? The classical piece is the Andante from Mozart's Piano Concerto No 21. The other piece is ""Great Balls of Fire."" If you're mistaken and thinking of Niles, it's the theme song from Wings. These pieces of music can quickly be found on YouTube - check them out and let me know. If it's none of these, I'll look further into it until it's found."

Good luck!"
Frasier,2v6cv8,MarkyMark8,2,Sun Feb 8 09:04:11 2015 UTC,"It could be Season 4 Episode 1 - The Two Mrs Cranes. Frasier plays what you describe at the 6 minute mark.  Alternatively, it could be Season 6 episode 1 - Good Grief. This isn't so much jazz, but rather an operetta Frasier is writing between jobs; but the music comes closer to the start of the episode.  Also, Season 1 episode 4 starts this way.  It's entirely possible that Niles is the one playing piano also.   Season 9 episode 7 - Bla Z Boy starts like this.  Season 6 episode 17 starts with Niles playing a classical piece - not jazz however.  Hope this helps :)  There is another brief smooth jazzy excerpt that I have in my head but I can't quite remember when it took place. :/"

Frasier,2ullqp,K3R3G3,5,Tue Feb 3 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I doubt it's the same. Martin wouldn't make an IPA his regular beer. Plus, he vowed to never drink another bottle."
Frasier,2ullqp,droopyGT,2,Tue Feb 3 16:53:10 2015 UTC,"It's the same brand! There's a lot of uncertainty due to the company's history which brew Martin actually drank, but at least one source says he drank the Ale ( IPA ).   Ballantine was an American brewery. It was best known for Ballantine Ale, a pale ale that is one of the oldest brands of beer in the United States.  Ballantine was the preferred beer of Martin Crane on the television show Frasier. He drinks the pale ale in almost every episode, usually from the can.   At first I thought the same thing, that Martin would drink more of a ""Beer's Beer"" beer, but considering the close association with baseball that Ballantine Ale has, now I think this might be it!"
Frasier,2ullqp,droopyGT,3,Tue Feb 3 17:07:23 2015 UTC,I...possibly...stand corrected...  What's your source on that quoted text?  (I don't see what the video and baseball prove.)
Frasier,2ullqp,autowikibot,3,Tue Feb 3 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"The source on that quote is practically nothing. It's just floating around the internet. So you're not really corrected, I'm just saying it's possible.  The video proves that Ballantine Ale is an IPA, but the reputations of current IPAs as hop-head drinks shouldn't be taken into consideration, since Ballantine IPA is a very old and extremely popular everyman drink, especially with sports fans. So I could easily see it being something Martin would drink, especially since it would have peaked in popularity when he was younger.  Edit: Found a few images of Martin's Ballantine cans. Might be ""Ballantine Premium Lager Beer""? Having a little trouble matching it.  Edit: Fixed link."
Frasier,2ullqp,ilavayou,4,Tue Feb 3 17:34:16 2015 UTC,"I gotcha - you're saying it's a possibility. I agree. Yeah, a Lager is different from an IPA and a Lager is certainly what I'd sooner expect Martin to drink regularly. If you go to 12 minutes in to season 6 episode 19 (the I.Q./dinner with the nobel prize winners episode), they show the first case of Ballantine's that Martin and Hester bought together. That could help in the search to determine if you want to look."
Frasier,2ullqp,ilavayou,2,Tue Feb 3 18:07:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Captured this. It looks like it probably says ""Premium Lager Beer"" but it's a tough read. Makes me miss HD! Hopefully Pabst will bring back the Lager if the IPA does well. Either way I'm happy to be enjoying a Ballantine :)"
Frasier,2ullqp,jo_maka,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"The video proves that Ballantine Ale is an IPA   I don't think so. In the three commercials in the video it clearly says ""Premium Lager Beer"" on the labels/cans, not ale, and certainly not an IPA.  Also,  ale != pale ale != india pale ale. Ballantine Ale was a pale ale, but there were other styles of ale that they made and that was separate from an india pale ale that they also made."
Frasier,2ullqp,illmaticDylan,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"I'm with you I don't think Martin would have drank an IPA on the reg. Ale possibly, Lager most likely. See my comment below.

Frasier,2uamjv,WaterStoryMark,17,Sat Jan 31 17:41:14 2015 UTC,"This, Lilith is the most attractive recurring character of the show.  Her intellectual mannerisms and her classy ensembles, her monolithic aura and her moments of weakness make her the most interesting female personality."
Frasier,2uamjv,RealCraftyGuy,5,Sat Jan 31 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"Fras: ""I'm famished""  Lilith: ""You should be. You've been a busy boy"".  Freeze frame here. Watch her eyes. Any man is putty in her hands at that very moment."

Frasier,2uamjv,k_rock923,5,Sat Jan 31 19:19:31 2015 UTC,"If I stay within the confines of your question, I would choose Daphne.  Daphne is no prude but she's not interested in going through men like it's a contest.  I'm more attracted to Roz (Peri Gilpin's voice is so hot) but Roz is someone you date.  I don't think she would be happy in a long-term marriage.  I think eventually she'd get the itch to move on.  Being middle-aged I've learned not to make choices like this that invite unhappiness.  If we were to think about other women on the show, two stand out for me.  The pastry chef that Fraser dated--Faye--or the character that Laura Linney played, because it's Laura Linney.  SPOILER:  He went to Chicago for that woman and I think that was the smart play."
Frasier,2uamjv,Pippen1984,4,Sat Jan 31 19:28:01 2015 UTC,"Great response! Laura Linney is stunningly beautiful, and her character is so lovely. Sweet and nurturing, which is really displayed in the episode where Frasier causes her to miss her train. I look at this episode more than any as a suggestion that Frasier and Her get married. We can only speculate due to the way the series ended, however the compatibility is strongly on display.  Thanks for this answer!"
Frasier,2uamjv,OneRainyNight,3,Sat Jan 31 19:47:53 2015 UTC,Yep!  I don't know how a straight man doesn't fall for Laura Linney's character.  Although one wonders if Frasier missed an opportunity with Aaron Eckhart's character.  They really seemed to have a connection :)
Frasier,2uamjv,greyconcepts,2,Sat Jan 31 19:51:06 2015 UTC,"For years, I have thought that Faye was the best woman Frasier ever dated.  I'm still annoyed, over a TV character mind you, that he ruined it."

Frasier,2uamjv,punchs,3,Sat Jan 31 18:46:02 2015 UTC,Daphne. This is much like the Jennifer or Bailey question. Speaking of the answer is always Bailey.

Frasier,2tth0f,Lars34,12,Tue Jan 27 12:44:48 2015 UTC,"I was looking at episode transcript and found this:   This is an inside joke.  Toward the end of last season, NBC contracted with NASCAR to carry some events.  They then began an ad campaign which spoofed another ad campaign (the product is unimportant) featuring an announcer describing the movie You've Got Mail and asking the audience if they had seen it.  The ad then showed a rough-looking western type of man and the announcer said ""This guy hasn't seen it.""  NBC's take on it went something like this: ""You know that show Frasier?  It has the two brothers who are psychiatrists and they go to operas and sit drinking Lattes.  You know that show?"" All the while, the picture showed shots of auto races and pit stops, etc. A NASCAR driver was then shown.  The announcer continued: ""It's on the same network as this guy!"" Kelsey was somewhat irritated at the ad, and this joke with Niles mispronouncing ""NASCAR"" is meant as a jab at NBC."

She has tighter and low-cut tops, wears shorter/slit skirts and boots, has her hair done in different ways, gets quite tan several times and wears better makeup.

One thing I remember was that John Mahoney requested that he finally said 'thank you' to Fraiser in the final episode, stemming right back to the first episode when Frasier complained about how Martin moving in had completely overhauled his life, and that, not once, did his dad say 'thank you'."

Frasier,2swixr,DoctorSteve,4,Mon Jan 19 10:08:39 2015 UTC,I felt exactly the same the first and second time I finished the show. Now I can go back and re-watch and enjoy without feeling too sad because I know everyone has their happy ending.
Frasier,2swixr,Sproose_Moose,3,Mon Jan 19 07:57:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree that everyone met a happy ending. Niles and Daphne did. Martin is happy with Ronnie and Eddie is still alive, but he would have been better off with Cora Winston. Based on an overwhelming amount of evidence it has to be assumed that Frasier will screw up his promising relationship. Roz has lost Rodger with no apparent replacement."
Frasier,2swixr,droopyGT,1 point,Tue Jan 20 01:59:48 2015 UTC,"Martin seemed over the top happy with Ronnie, and they get to enjoy things I doubt Cora would. Roz didn't need a man to be happy in the end, she had a daughter and a great career. Frasier's relationship with Charlotte was different to all of his other ones because they were both clumsy and insecure but for Frasier to go out of his comfort zone to be with her it might just work out."
Frasier,2swixr,Sproose_Moose,3,Tue Jan 20 02:05:40 2015 UTC,"Excellent discussion points. Martin's relationship with Ronnie was forced too fast. If he only lived 7 more years it would have been good, but I think he never truly let go of Hester and that combined with Ronnie's promiscuity would have taken its toll. Charlotte was quick to ditch Frasier for her former life, not a good sign. If she appeared as committed to Frasier as Claire was I would see the end differently.  Edit: I forgot to discuss Roz. Her breakdown in Tacoma showed how much she needed Rodger. Nothing bad about him is ever portrayed. He's the dad Alice needed. Yes, Roz was originally supposed to come across as a strong independent woman, but her relationships with Rodger and Bulldog undermined that. She was clearly hungering for a stable two parent household."
Frasier,2swixr,droopyGT,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:53:44 2015 UTC,I'll concede that Roz really should have stayed with Rodger. That made me sad that how they ended.

Frasier,2swixr,Axadarm,5,Wed Jan 21 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"I was never really happy with the ending, at least Frasier's part of it anyway. He did EXACTLY what he did with many women in his failed relationship streak - he drops everything, convinced that she is the one and forgoes all logic and instincts just because he's made a decision he feels he needs to go with all the way. He barely even knew Charlotte yet seemingly dropped all his plans just for that risk. I understand he does explain in the show through that brilliant end show reading about taking risks and regrets but anyone who has watched this show knows Frasier loves to do this kinda shit and always gets caught up in the thrill that blinds him to the truth.   The show doesn't exactly clarify what he did, for all we know he still took that job and was merely flying to Chicago to see if she wanted to be with him and if not he still has his new life but it seemed to heavily imply he didn't and was risking it all on that visit. Still, Frasier really didn't know that woman well, especially to throw all his life plans out the window and travel across the country to be with. I still feel by far the best women he was ever with was Claire or Faye. Claire, no question, was easily the best match he ever had and it was his own fault for blowing that (especially on goddamn Lana of all people). Faye would be my second choice, another he struck out on hard and had only himself to blame."
Frasier,2swixr,useless-knowledge,1 point,Fri Jan 23 13:21:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. At least the ending is true to Frasier's character, but it also shows that he hasn't really grown at all. It's realistic but also unsatisfactory."

I think it speaks to the strength of the writing that they can make such a great episode out of one scene: Frasier and Niles sitting in Frasier's apartment.

Frasier,2qr5vf,nevearz,4,Tue Dec 30 03:46:57 2014 UTC,I just watched an episode where he has dinner with his publisher (not Ros) and he doesnt know if its a business occasion or a date. The ending scene is absolutely hilarious.
Frasier,2qr5vf,nevearz,4,Tue Dec 30 03:48:14 2014 UTC,That's a really good one. He's losing his mind with all the signals from Cassandra going back and forth between platonic and romantic.  What's the end scene again?
Frasier,2qr5vf,buttonnose1,2,Tue Dec 30 04:31:25 2014 UTC,She gets into bed while he gets undressed and he's not sure if hes meant to get into bed with her. Finally he asks her but shes already fallen asleep so he calls Niels.   Have to watch it out
Frasier,2qr5vf,luminosite,3,Tue Dec 30 05:39:47 2014 UTC,"I remember -- saw it in the last week or two -- was just the scene to which you referred. I've watched the series many times and watch episodes daily. It's actually the last scene of the second act (first w/Niles, second w/Frasier and Cassandra, third w/Daphne and Martin)  Refresher for others:  [6.14 ""Three Valentines""]  She sits on the bed and so does he.  Cassandra: Oh, my God!  Frasier: [jumping up] What?  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Cassandra: I just can't believe it's so late.  What are you sorry             for?  Frasier: Oh, just for... keeping you up so late.  Cassandra: Oh, that's all right.  Aren't you coming to bed?  Frasier: Oh, yes.  Coming to bed.  Coming to... this bed.  Cassandra: Well, would you mind turning the lights out?  Frasier: Oh, no, no, not at all.  He turns out the light, and in the darkness can be heard slipping  into bed.  Frasier: You know, Cassandra, I know this may sound like a silly           question seeing as how we're... in bed together and...           nearly naked, and... I've just been wondering: Is this a           romantic date, or... a business thing?  There is the sound of snoring, followed by clicking noises.  Frasier: Roz, it's Frasier!

Frasier,2pr1en,theworldbystorm,17,Fri Dec 19 03:02:09 2014 UTC,Niles is a pretty bad person if we look at the show from not his viewpoint.
Frasier,2pr1en,DoctorSteve,14,Fri Dec 19 05:07:33 2014 UTC,And Frasier is incredibly shallow regardless of the viewpoint.
Frasier,2pr1en,Chanz,7,Fri Dec 19 14:17:35 2014 UTC,"by all accounts, if this were another show, frasier would be a comedic relief character we'd have to suffer through as he antagonizes the protagonist with his eccentricities and snobbery"
Frasier,2pr1en,onthefence928,19,Fri Dec 19 15:40:32 2014 UTC,It's almost as if he started that way on another show...
Frasier,2pr1en,Darclite,12,Fri Dec 19 22:26:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah it's kind of funny how if the show wasn't from the perspective we see, we'd realize how fucked up what Niles and Daphne did to Mel and Donny actually was. Niles basically saying ""if you wanna do this I could drop Mel in a second, no problem"" and Daphne leaving Donny at the altar are really sad. I don't think it was the wrong decision after reaching that point, but they probably shouldn't have rushed into things so much if there was a chance for these feelings to exist."
Frasier,2pr1en,jesus_fn_christ,8,Fri Dec 19 03:50:55 2014 UTC,After 9 seasons of watching Niles fawn over Daphne and hover on the edge of almost... Of course that's for whom we root.
Frasier,2pr1en,K3R3G3,11,Fri Dec 19 04:43:03 2014 UTC,"True, it sure seemed like a rough thing for him. But then him going after marriage with two more women in such a short time period didn't really show great judgement. He may have been similarly willing to just go after Daphne without any real love or at least great haste. Donny may have been the male version of Sherry with a wedding addiction."
Frasier,2pr1en,Darclite,12,Fri Dec 19 03:59:51 2014 UTC,That's actually something I thought they handled poorly. I would have rather they just showed his character ending up okay. Flipping out on Niles in front of his fiance seemed kind of out-of-place.
Frasier,2pr1en,C-Ride742,5,Fri Dec 19 05:35:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah. Above all, Donny seemed like a nice guy. When he sued everybody, that was understandable. That's what he does. But he got over it and it's just not in his nature to hold a grudge."
Frasier,2pr1en,C-Ride742,1 point,Fri Dec 19 22:30:51 2014 UTC,"I agree that being left at the alter was rough on him and may have influenced his willingness to marry other women so soon.    He may have been similarly willing to just go after Daphne without any real love or at least great haste   Do you mean his initial romance with Daphne or his actions when the main cast meet up with Donny at the courthouse and Donny claims he'll leave whoever he's marrying to be with Daphne?  If you mean the initial courtship, there's plenty of evidence that Donny was not furthering the relationship out of haste."
Frasier,2pr1en,doctorpogo,7,Fri Dec 19 07:35:11 2014 UTC,"Yes, I do feel bad for Donny just as I felt bad for Mel. One was left at the alter, while the other was left while planning their honeymoon.   Donny is set up to be the pitiful one: he at first lashes out with suing everyone he can, because he's a divorce lawyer, that's what he knows. But then he calms down and drops those lawsuits. Then he next times we see him, he's marrying some other woman.  I don't remember how long in the story it is, but it seems like a very short time after you've been jilted at the alter.  Mel is set up to be the scorned/vindictive side. She baits Niles around to do her bidding until the ""right"" time for her to divorce him arrives.  Finally, Niles has enough and says he's through, but has he really made up for breaking up with the women he married not even a week ago?  While the main theme may be ""true love conquerors all"", they do a good job showing how the ones left behind may deal with the main character's choices."
Frasier,2pr1en,guchi4life,4,Fri Dec 19 08:02:09 2014 UTC,"I think to some degree we're 'supposed' to feel bad for Donny and Mel. What happened to them was really awful, and I don't think either of their responses were as severe as they could have been given the situation.  I like that the show was willing to take some time to show the consequences of the main characters' actions and the effect on the people around them. And I like that with Donny at least they didn't completely make him a villain (they had kind of been setting up Mel as a villain all along, so she didn't get to be as sympathetic)."
Frasier,2pr1en,Darclite,5,Fri Dec 19 13:10:29 2014 UTC,"I do feel for him but what I really didn't like was how they made his character all bitter and sad that he lost daphne. In the episode where they're getting married (Niles and daphne) and donny shows up, the way they wrote his character was just awful. That's why I really felt bad for him and found it completely unnecessary to even bring him back."
Frasier,2pr1en,l23r,3,Fri Dec 19 18:02:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah that little tirade he went off on at Niles was one of the few parts of the series I thought was just plain bad. The premise, the writing, the acting, none of it was good or funny. Just sad and uncomfortable for everyone."
Frasier,2pr1en,morning_espresso,2,Sat Dec 20 06:16:17 2014 UTC,"I did feel bad for him, but I felt happier for Niles... Then how he acted afterwards just turned me off him, though I guess that was the writers intent."
Frasier,2pr1en,Sorryaboutthat1time,1 point,Fri Dec 19 05:23:12 2014 UTC,"I've always thought the writers failed at finally getting Daphne and Niles together. Admittedly it was time at this point in the series, but I've never understood why they had to make the circumstances so complicated. There were times where this storyline was just cringeworthy.  As for Donny, I think the writers were only left with the option to make the audience dislike Donny. They had to ensure that the audience would continue to like Niles and Daphne and sympathize with them."
Frasier,2pr1en,TheOmnomnomagon,1 point,Sat Dec 20 14:40:45 2014 UTC,"Why should 2 people be happy when 4 people can be ... eh nevermind, Niles is a homewrecker."
Frasier,2pr1en,setmehigh,1 point,Sun Dec 21 00:31:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I did feel sorry for him, which is what I love about the story line. Too many stories make the ""other guy/girl"" a dick/bitch to make it easier for audiences root for the main character. It's a pet peeve of mine cause it's boring and removes a lot of the tension.  They didn't acheive the same thing with Mel, unfortunately, but I think they were trying to make her Maria-esque. Still, I think they could've shown more intimate scenes with the two of them at least.  I can kinda forgive them making him a dick after the breakup since he was understandably pissed at the two of them."
Frasier,2ppali,sodasne,27,Thu Dec 18 17:57:14 2014 UTC,"Niles, I would offer you some Sherry, but I'm afraid I'm fresh out!"
Frasier,2ppali,Kel-Mitchell,6,Thu Dec 18 18:49:24 2014 UTC,Hahaha! Exactly. Some of the exchanges between Niles and Frasier about Sherry are so classic.
Frasier,2ppali,derpina_is_a_mermaid,3,Thu Dec 18 19:03:50 2014 UTC,One of my favorite moments...the way they celebrate just after this line...so funny.
Frasier,2ppali,K3R3G3,14,Thu Dec 18 21:10:30 2014 UTC,"I've always hated Sherry as well but I still like that she was on the show. Marty had to have someone he could feel young again with. I like Sherry solely for Martins benefit. Well, Frasier and Niles' jokes were pretty good too.   But if we're talking about ruining episodes, Dr. Mary takes the proverbial cake."
Frasier,2ppali,ChaosSpeed,10,Thu Dec 18 21:03:25 2014 UTC,It's unfortunate they tried to dress racism with a character that is in fact a caricature of racial stereotypes.
Frasier,2ppali,sendmorekittens,2,Thu Dec 18 21:15:32 2014 UTC,"I don't think she's caricatured, I just don't think Mary is well-developed."
Frasier,2ppali,theworldbystorm,24,Fri Dec 19 02:59:23 2014 UTC,"Heh....I really didn't mind Sherry, and I particularly like the break-up scene between her and Martin. It was so genuine and authentic.  Now, my vote for a character who ruins every episode she's in is Daphne's mother. Mrs. Moon is like nails on a chalkboard."
Frasier,2ppali,derpina_is_a_mermaid,6,Thu Dec 18 18:40:30 2014 UTC,I wouldn't upset Mrs. Moon. She has a license to kill.
Frasier,2ppali,FrozenRaider,3,Thu Dec 18 19:02:34 2014 UTC,"Both the mother and Daphne's brother, Simon were terrible characters. I thought these characters were much funnier in Daphne's dialogs rather than onscreen."
Frasier,2ppali,morning_espresso,2,Sat Dec 20 14:21:31 2014 UTC,"Agreed, I think she was a good fit for Martin and whoever that was  is definitely going to be irritating to Frasier and Niles, and as it is so much fun to see Frasier go into a tailspin, I think we all got a lot of proxy laughs out of Sherry."
Frasier,2ppali,kidmuaddib3,7,Wed Jan 7 22:32:50 2015 UTC,"Daphne hates sherry, the boys just whine."
Frasier,2ppali,squishymarshmallows,8,Fri Dec 19 06:33:54 2014 UTC,For me the character that gets on my nerves every time is Freddy. For some reason he just bugs the crap out of me.
Frasier,2ppali,Lucky_Locura,6,Fri Dec 19 02:54:35 2014 UTC,same here. fuck that kid
Frasier,2ppali,tarannum_n,6,Fri Dec 19 03:47:09 2014 UTC,for me it's Daphne's mom.. she was just so loud and always complaining.
Frasier,2ppali,teskedsgumman,2,Fri Dec 19 04:01:43 2014 UTC,I skip all the Freddy and Lilith episodes. Can't stand those two.
Frasier,2ppali,methodmayne,4,Fri Dec 19 03:53:53 2014 UTC,Even the one where she sleeps with Niles in the hotel?!  'breakfast... In the bathroom?' 'my God!' 'My goddess! '

Frasier,2ppali,morning_espresso,5,Fri Dec 19 03:54:08 2014 UTC,"Her character was annoying, but it seems to me that this was what the writers were going for....and they succeeded. The 'Daphne Hates Sherry' episode with its classic plot of Niles trying everything he can to get Daphne alone with him is one of my favorites."
Frasier,2ppali,Twiggy3,3,Sat Dec 20 14:27:23 2014 UTC,"Ronnie is a worse girlfriend for Martin. Hastily written in with a completely out of character Martin being a complete competitive dick to Frasier (see his guilt in the Maureen episodes, which doesn't apply all of a sudden).  In general she is a one joke character, she sleeps/slept with a lot of people.  At least Sherry had a bit more of a character going for her."
Frasier,2ppali,DoctorSteve,7,Mon Dec 29 18:17:58 2014 UTC,I loved the Sherry episodes.
Frasier,2pb8ol,Spinetablet,8,Mon Dec 15 00:59:31 2014 UTC,Double victory because it means you can watch with them and have great inside jokes with your friend about how awesome Frasier is
Frasier,2pb8ol,knifeyspooney3,3,Mon Dec 15 01:13:36 2014 UTC,"We've just gotten through 2 out of 4 discs on thhe first Season and we're already quoting it. And he always says ""Ah, good show man!"" It's gonna be sweet, I've been itching for another watch through."

Frasier,2pb8ol,droopyGT,3,Mon Dec 15 01:58:11 2014 UTC,"It's out of order on Netflix. At the beginning it makes almost no difference but later on when Daphne is pregnant it makes no sense when one day she looks like she's swallowed a melon and then other days she looks a track star.  Also it's easier to have it set up in his PS3 so we can just turn that on and play it instead of having to connect to netflix. Also I bought them, so might as well use them."
Frasier,2pb8ol,DoctorSteve,2,Mon Dec 15 02:01:16 2014 UTC,"It's out of order on Netflix.   You're not the first person I've heard say this, but in my experience it's not true. I've watched the entire series via Netflix several times and it's always in order. I'm watching through again and have gotten to the part where Daphne ""goes for her masters at the fat academy"" and the order was correct.  That said, DVD is a fine way to watch them, Netflix is just way more convenient for me, personally. As long as you aren't watching the cut-up censored version that is in syndication, you're good."
Frasier,2pb8ol,besyuziki,4,Mon Dec 15 20:08:24 2014 UTC,There's no resisting it. The show starts so strong you're hooked!
Frasier,2p44gx,Chanz,21,Fri Dec 12 21:16:33 2014 UTC,"The Christmas episode where Niles is dressed as Jesus in the bathroom has pretty big physical comedy. But it's tough, so much of Frasier's comedy is wordplay."
Frasier,2p44gx,were_only_human,2,Fri Dec 12 21:19:56 2014 UTC,Merry Christmas Mrs. Moskowitz. I gave the same answer. High five.
Frasier,2p44gx,ShinyDisc0Balls,21,Sat Dec 13 19:01:07 2014 UTC,"The one with the fencing instructor! It has a bit of german, and it will clue her in right away."

Frasier,2p44gx,hmblm12,2,Sat Dec 13 06:10:58 2014 UTC,"Didn't think of this one but, yeah, I think this would be the best bet."
Frasier,2p44gx,Stalked_Like_Corn,17,Sat Dec 13 15:38:54 2014 UTC,"I would recommend ""the Ski Lodge"" or ""High Holidays."" Both of them contain a bit of physical comedy mixed with the usual Frasier wordplay, but neither episode is particularly daunting nor difficult to understand the basic comedic premise. Love triangles and drug use thankfully transcend language barriers! My friends in Heidelberg very much enjoyed those two episodes when I showed it to them last summer and one of them has a somewhat shaky grasp on the English language, so I imagine you will have no problems. Viel Glück!"
Frasier,2p44gx,Oberst_Azrael,2,Fri Dec 12 22:04:34 2014 UTC,"I totally want to show my German housemates some Fraiser, and the winter season is the perfect time for these episodes. I hope they like it as much as your friends did... Vielen dank!"
Frasier,2p44gx,l23r,10,Sat Dec 13 03:32:22 2014 UTC,The Valentine episode is a cop out here :p  Just show her the pilot!
Frasier,2p44gx,DoctorSteve,8,Fri Dec 12 22:14:13 2014 UTC,"Non-native English speaker here, I've shown myself all episodes.  But if you're set on ""standalone"" episodes that don't rely on references, I can recommend The Matchmaker and Flour Child from S2 or Oops from S1. Other than that, Three Valentines from S6 has a great opening bit with David Hyde Pierce's great physical comedy performance. I wouldn't show her anything post S7 because of the Niles-Daphne subplot."
Frasier,2p44gx,besyuziki,3,Sat Dec 13 08:27:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, post S7 will ruin a lot but, I think everyone could see that coming together eventually.  They almost, always, do.  My favorite is Ham Radio and would recommend that one but someone else already suggested An Affair to Forget which has the German fencing instructor in it and might be funny for her, being German and all."
Frasier,2p44gx,Stalked_Like_Corn,3,Sat Dec 13 15:42:31 2014 UTC,Where Niles keeps fainting at the sight of his own blood and burns his clothes etc - not typically Frasier-esque but worthy of attention.
Frasier,2p44gx,Pleasant_Jim,3,Sat Dec 13 19:01:54 2014 UTC,Merry Christmas Mrs. Moskowitz was always one of my favorites
Frasier,2p44gx,ShinyDisc0Balls,3,Sat Dec 13 19:00:27 2014 UTC,"The Innkeepers, where Frasier and Niles buy a restaurant and hijinks ensue.  Or one of the gay trilogy, i.e. The Matchmaker, Out with Dad, or the Doctor is Out.  Edit: For some reason, there are some episodes where they cap on Germany.  Don't show her any of those."
Frasier,2p44gx,Sorryaboutthat1time,3,Mon Dec 15 16:06:31 2014 UTC,"Three Valentines.  It's a classic and displays all the characters' personalities well.  Apart from that, there's a lot of the comedy that can be gleaned without a perfect understanding of the language. This is of course true for the first scene with no dialogue whatsoever."
Frasier,2p44gx,sublimesam,2,Sun Dec 28 05:41:15 2014 UTC,Couldn't agree more with this. Niles's segment alone is a perfect.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, and maybe in the future I'll rewatch it, but I didn't love it. 4/5 stars. It just didn't have the je ne sais quoi that shows like Frasier/Chuck/Community/Psych/Seinfeld/Sunny/AD have.  I also watched The Perfect Host (2010 film) because it stars David Hyde Pierce. I definitely recommend that too! It's so cool to see an actor that you so strongly identify as a particular character playing a super different character. And the film was great, too."
Frasier,2ol695,ipretendiamacat,19,Sun Dec 7 23:02:33 2014 UTC,"je ne sais qoui   Yup, this man just finished watching Fraiser..."
Frasier,2ol695,Stalked_Like_Corn,12,Mon Dec 8 00:40:38 2014 UTC,"It's great, because using that phrase in most context makes you sound like a tool. But I think I can get away with it on /r/Frasier."
Frasier,2ol695,C_Brooks11,1 point,Mon Dec 8 00:54:40 2014 UTC,"Yes, yes you can.   And yes, it would typically make you sound like a gigantic douche outside of France but, here, it's okay."
Frasier,2ol695,OneRainyNight,3,Sat Dec 13 15:44:47 2014 UTC,Or a Sonic commercial.
Frasier,2ol695,thratty,5,Wed Dec 10 00:06:50 2014 UTC,"I absolutely loved it. Grammer is unreal in the role, and it's fascinating to see him take on a character like that. Totally nails it. It's really too bad that they cancelled it."
Frasier,2ol695,OneRainyNight,2,Mon Dec 8 05:26:27 2014 UTC,It's extremely impressive for an actor to not be typecast even after playing the same character for 20 years. Kelsey Grammer is incredible.
Frasier,2ol695,FoeHammer7777,3,Mon Dec 8 21:40:55 2014 UTC,I wouldn't have believed he could do it until seeing him succeed at it. Same with David Hyde Pierce in The Perfect Host. They are both amazing actors to move on from their roles as the Crane brothers.
Frasier,2ol695,echoswolf,1 point,Mon Dec 8 22:23:18 2014 UTC,"Grammer was the sole reason I could watch that show. His acting was amazing and fit the role perfectly. But the rest of the show... Eh. None of the other characters drew me in, and the story took more time than it needed to develop. I'd recommend it to a Grammer fan, but otherwise, don't bother."
Frasier,2ol695,thebuccaneersden,2,Fri Dec 26 21:47:19 2014 UTC,"It's great, but be warned it doesn't end neatly, 'cause networks and profit and shit. Grammer nails it, though, and it's fascinating to see him play such a different character, and such a complex one.  I'd compare it to Breaking Bad and House of Cards myself; not as good as either, but with the spirit of both."
Frasier,2ol695,itsaboat,3,Sun Dec 7 23:39:23 2014 UTC,"Yup. Totally enjoyed it. Was disappointed that it was cancelled so early on. I can see how it's not for everyone, but it's also disappointing that a show like the Kardashians and Honey Boo Boo can live on for so long while Boss was barely given a chance."
Frasier,2ol695,jesus_fn_christ,4,Mon Dec 8 18:48:44 2014 UTC,If you like House of Cards you will like Boss.
Frasier,2ol695,Stalked_Like_Corn,7,Mon Dec 8 19:12:29 2014 UTC,"I found it on Netflix the other day and considered watching it. But I'm always hesitant to get into a show that I know got canceled. You know, Firefly syndrome."
Frasier,2ol695,DisabledJew,2,Sun Dec 7 23:41:00 2014 UTC,"I watched half of the first episode when it initially aired but trying to disconnected the character of Frasier from suddenly being the Mayor of Chicago (Chicago right?) was just weird.  Though, he DID fly there at the end of Frasier so maybe he re-invented himself.  I, too, watched the first episode again just the other day and plan on trying to watch the show itself despite the fact it's cancelled already."
Frasier,2ol695,OldCleanBastard,3,Sat Dec 13 15:46:23 2014 UTC,Yeah! I saw it on Netflix and ripped through both seasons.  It's totally worth it.

Frasier,2ol695,K3R3G3,3,Mon Dec 8 06:19:21 2014 UTC,"Tom Cane is absolutely terrifying overall, even more so because I've met my fair share of real life ""Tom Canes"". You root for him, you hate him, you fear him, you respect him, and not even in the entirety of the 2 seasons but in a SINGLE episode. Is there anything Kelsey can't do as an actor?  Boss could ascend to one of my favorite dramas depending on how the plot moved on, but I guess we'll never find out. Now it's just depressing to rewatch thanks to the abrupt ending."
Frasier,2olyh4,SantosPhillipCarlo,3,Mon Dec 8 03:07:11 2014 UTC,"Imagine that! :D  This is extremely well written (at least chapter 1), hats off!"
Frasier,2olyh4,MeisterEder,2,Tue Dec 9 00:10:16 2014 UTC,For sure. Give it a shot throughout - you won't be disappointed! Frasier and Co. come in in about Chapter 13 when Jerry and Elaine travel to Seattle. It's a bit like Chapters 1-12 are a Seinfeld episode before it switches to a Frasier episode featuring Jerry and Elaine.

Frasier,2o9jho,Sorryaboutthat1time,3,Thu Dec 25 19:32:36 2014 UTC,"In the comments of this article, someone points out that in the episode with Frasier's mentor, they're drinking an ""Andalusian Amontillado"". Also mentioned is the fact that when they pour out the drink, it's normally pale coloured. While an amontillado isn't pale, neither is a cream sherry. I can't see Frasier drinking a cream sherry, even if it's not as bad when it's been laid down for a few years.  Given it's quaffability for Niles and Frasier at any time of the day or night, along with the lighter colour, I'd be much more inclined to suggest that they are drinking either a Fino (very dry) or Manzanilla (less dry, fruitier, more like a medium white wine).  Source: unashamed sherry-quaffer."

Frasier,2nuljr,Britt_Solo,7,Sun Nov 30 17:55:47 2014 UTC,"I believe that was a big reason they cast David Hyde Pierce in the role.  Sam even makes a comment about it in ""The Show Where Sam Shows Up"" in Season 2."
Frasier,2nuljr,ez_sleazy,6,Mon Dec 1 14:53:36 2014 UTC,"Yup, Frasier had no siblings and a dead father in Cheers, and the show was supposed to mostly center around KACL."

Frasier,2nuljr,SolarTea,5,Mon Dec 8 02:03:58 2014 UTC,"It was supposed to be a work base show, think of the Office, where most all takes place at work.   I believe it was changed to the way it turned out to be after casting David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney. Then they didn't want a British woman to play Daphne cause of another show that had a British actress in a similar role (The Nanny, I think?)

Frasier,2nuljr,Lairo1,4,Mon Dec 1 14:13:54 2014 UTC,Rumours were Shelley Long wanted Kelsey Grammer off but I just found this blog by Ken Levine who was a screenwriter on Cheers who refutes it  http://kenlevine.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/did-shelley-long-try-to-get-kelsey.html?m=1
Frasier,2nuljr,bwhale42,9,Mon Dec 1 15:58:22 2014 UTC,Diane just met Frasier's mother and she threatened her with a gun - so that's where the reference in Don Juan in Hell Pt2 is from!

Frasier,2njvcz,K3R3G3,5,Thu Nov 27 23:15:13 2014 UTC,"Generally, it's really not a big deal. But the writers on this show changed quite a bit and, as a result, it had a sort of evolution. For that reason, I prefer to move through that evolution via chronology so the nature of the material and intercharacter dynamics don't change drastically from one episode to the next.  TL;DR - It doesn't really matter, but I prefer chronologically.  (Also, the reason of Niles' relationships' storylines is a good one to watch in order.)"
Frasier,2njvcz,Stalked_Like_Corn,2,Fri Nov 28 05:44:49 2014 UTC,"There are some things that have a series long continuity that might be missed.  In order you watch the relationship grow between Frasier and his Father and you see the relationship grow between Niles and Daphne.  You hear the 'ol ""Kill the singing Santa"" joke a few times.  It's brought up probably 3 or 4 times in the series and it's funnier each time because you know it's like a recurring theme a bit.  Also you see all the failed attempts at the parties they throw.  This might be lost if you watch out of sequence as they may only show a couple and you don't quite grasp that they throw a dozen or more and they all go horribly wrong for one reason or another."

Daphne still loved her, despite these frustrations, so Frasier and/or Niles slapping a label on her wouldn't have gone well for either of them. Plus, I think doing that for the viewer, putting that heavy diagnosis on her, might even have made her more annoying than funny. It's a sitcom, after all, and laughs are better than resentment."

And yes, if it isn't obvious, it is pure fantasy, right down to pretending it's authentic and the actors portraying the ""characters."" The Maris one started off as a joke that sort of got out of hand. To be honest I never expected anyone to find the Wikia and I sort of cringe at the episode ideas themselves, but hopefully people can derive some sort of enjoyment out of it.

Frasier,2mlvay,Sorryaboutthat1time,6,Mon Nov 17 23:02:26 2014 UTC,"Absolutely not.  What pisses me off most about them is that they parade about as psychiatrists, but EVERY SINGLE PROFESSIONAL ACT they perform is that of a psychologist. They are psychologists. I have no clue why the writers decided to call them psychiatrists. Psychiatrists treats disorders and such, prescribing the right medicines and methods of treatment. Psychologists are more like very advanced therapists, delving deep into your issues with you to help resolve them (although some psychologists can prescribe, depending on the state).  Psychiatrist=medical doctor that treats mental disorders  Psychologist=doctor of psychology, dealing with the mind and helping you deal with your emotional issues  Many patients will see both of these doctors to treat their issues. Psychologists are usually seen far more frequently, they are a bit more hands on.  But to more accurately answer your question, Frasier is a fucking freudian. Freud's theories have been discredited for DECADES. At the time Freud was around, his theories seemed to ring true, because the culture of the time was sexually repressed, among other things.   Niles is, well, I forget what he was, started with an E, but I digress a follower of Carl Jung's postulates. I am sure his is pretty well outdated too. Jung is also very outdated.   TL;DR: Do not follow a damn word any of those two buffoons say. If you need real psychiatric or psychological advice, seek an actual psychiatrist or psychologist.  Edit: as far as how well they represent their psychological viewpoints, Frasier, I suppose does represent a Freudian, but I would need to ask a genuine professional who is also familiar with Frasier."
Frasier,2mlvay,magicfatkid,27,Tue Nov 18 00:59:39 2014 UTC,"Your definitions are correct, but your conclusion is wrong. They are Psychiatrists, because it's canonical that they both attended med school and earned MDs before specialising in Psychology. A few times in the show a plot point has relied on the fact that one or the other has been able to write a prescription for another character, which is, as you rightly say, one of the keys differences between a Psychiatrist and a Psychologist.  Part of the confusion can be attributed to the fact that the show has a very old fashioned take on the profession. This is fairly understandable when you consider the main character (and a few minor characters) were established back in the '80s. It is only recently that therapy has become the realm of Psychologists, traditionally it was practised by Psychiatrists. Don't forget that Freud was a doctor, and so were most of his followers. It was originally considered a legitimate branch of medicine, but now 'talking therapies' have been superseded by improved drug therapies, so the role of the Psychiatrist has shifted, and 'talking therapies' have been palmed off to Psychologists. When 'talking therapies' were the best thing going, it made sense for highly qualified, highly paid Psychiatrists to specialise in it, but now it doesn't so much. That's why the show doesn't square with reality - it's not wrong, it's outdated.  As for Freud being discredited, I think that's a little strong. One of the most popular forms of counselling (and the kind you're most likely to receive if you go through the NHS) is Transactional Analysis, which is a system developed by Dr Berne, M.D. in the '50s, and is heavily Freudian. The crazy thing is that it's popular now, despite being Freudian, but at the time he was worried about whether it appeared Freudian enough! In one of his books, ""What Do You Say After You Say Hello?"", he goes to the trouble of explicitly stating that his theories are Freud-compatible. Thomas A. Harris', M.D., book ""I'm OK, You're OK"" commits an entire chapter to defending the Freud-compatibility of the theory! Not being Freud-compatible at the time was as foolish as not being USB-compatible, now. And both are, of course, examples of how it used to be the norm (""Norm!"") for medical doctors to go Freudian/Psychodynamic if they wanted to specialise in Psychology.  Personally, I agree with Frasier that some of the core aspects of Freud's work will stand the test of time. It makes excellent evolutionary sense, for example, that a child will learn about romantic/sexual relationships by observing his/her parents. And although we've learned a lot about the dreaming brain in the past 100 years, I do not know of anyone who has proposed a better idea for explaining the content of dreams.  I agree with you that the vast majority of what Frasier advises should not be applied to real life, but not because he's a Freudian, but just because his advice is usually a constituent of a piece of humour. It would be like self-treating an ailment based on knowledge gained from 'Doctor, Doctor' jokes.  TL;DR: Lemme get out my pad and I'll write you a prescription for some Ritalin."
Frasier,2mlvay,daffodil_11,51,Tue Nov 18 15:49:29 2014 UTC,"This is Dr. Niles Crane, filling in for my ailing brother, Dr. Frasier Crane. Although I feel perfectly qualified to fill Frasier's radio shoes, I should warn you that while Frasier is a Freudian, I am a Jungian. So there'll be no blaming Mother today."
Frasier,2mlvay,octafed,2,Tue Nov 18 01:17:29 2014 UTC,"Ahh yeah, thats right.  Jung is pretty outdated I believe too."
Frasier,2mlvay,magicfatkid,13,Tue Nov 18 01:53:57 2014 UTC,"Judging from what's actually said on the show it does seem that Frasier is a practicing Freudian.  But as it isn't explicit, and it would be odd for him to be one, I've always assumed that he's simply a big fan of Freud's work rather than subscribing to outdated theories.  Just as a physicist could be a fan of Isaac Newton while still being aware and accepting of all the progress which came after.  I think the Freud/ Jung thing is largely just a way to show sibling rivalry, like them going to Harvard and Yale."
Frasier,2mlvay,no_prehensilizing,7,Tue Nov 18 03:07:20 2014 UTC,"I think it's pretty explicit that Frasier is a died in the wool Freudian. Reference the episode where Roz's cousin, played by Zooey Deschanel, comes to visit. She buys Frasier a bust of Freud trying to be ironic, but Frasier takes offense when she suggests Freud has been discredited and says that he ""likes to think Freud's theories will stand the test of time"". He then even goes on a rant on air defending Freud.    Edit for specific episode: S10E4 ""Kissing Cousins"""

Jen:  Really?  Have you read either of his books?  Frasier:  Excuse me, young lady...  Jen:  Uh-oh, here comes the lecture.  Frasier:  Yes, for once you are right, for a disquisition is indeed at hand.  And may I suggest you roll your eyes back into the forward  position, as I may actually employ some visual aids.

I know that Freud's work is still used today for critical analysis and has not been discredited. Of course his wilder theories no longer stand but to say that someone can't model their way of thinking after him is incorrect.

Frasier,2mlvay,squishymarshmallows,2,Tue Nov 18 22:30:24 2014 UTC,"Occasionally people see a psychiatrist weekly and speak to them for around an hour, similar to what people would do with a psychologist. The only difference is the shrink can also give them medicine, and they have privileges at a hospital so I assume it would be easier for them to get someone admitted.  I know someone who took a postpostgrad(?) course to become a Jungian therapist. It's not at a big school, but it's still an in-depth 1 or 2 year program, and he is currently doing private practice... Personally I think Jungs ideas are really intriguing, and you can find his teachings being used in Art therapy, which is often covered by insurance plans and is used in hospitals and schools."

Frasier,2lgc8x,Drusss,2,Sun Nov 9 08:43:34 2014 UTC,"That's understandable. Many writers came and went throughout the show's lifetime and it took on different characters as a result. I liked that the characters evolved over time and that different seasons have different feels. The events they experienced changed who they were. At least, that's one way to look at it."
Frasier,2lgc8x,K3R3G3,2,Mon Nov 10 02:49:55 2014 UTC,In one of those interviews they mentioned how not one of the original writers from Season 1 actually stayed on till Season 11!Which is amazing because I can pick up any episode from any season and see its consistency in quality writing and acting.  Actually Niles and Daphne both changed quite a bit. The quirky side of her was hardly tapped in the end. Frasier and Martin stayed mostly the same
Frasier,2lgc8x,Drusss,10,Wed Nov 12 15:08:13 2014 UTC,I love how they combined the no-dialogue farce with the sudden discovery that Maris was cheating--it went from hilarious to sad all at once and gave it that much more punch.  Niles was always my favorite.

Frasier,2kq513,Sorryaboutthat1time,6,Wed Oct 29 22:57:04 2014 UTC,"I guess I'd have to say niles would be the duchess because he is the more effeminate of the two overall, although frasier is pretty close. Then again, Frasier is more often on his father's and ronnie's nerves, so maybe they would call Frasier duchess because its the more derisive. Plus Frasier likes his baths an awful lot."
Frasier,2kq513,smellis45,5,Thu Oct 30 03:02:52 2014 UTC,"Generally, I'd say it really is a toss-up. The points you've made are good. Niles has a slimmer build and all that -- and Frasier can really get angry and scream like a man. But Martin and Ronnie are around Frasier more and he can be much more dramatic. I believe a strong case can be made for both. Without going down a huge list, here's an excerpt from ""The Ring Cycle"":  Frasier:  ""Chop, chop, Dad!  Let's get a move on!  The last time I was late for the farmer's market, I got the worst of the squash blossoms.""  [Martin comes in from the kitchen in his security uniform, carrying a bag.]  Martin:  [muttering]  ""Oh, whatever shall we serve the Duchess?""  Frasier: ""What?!""  I guess this could go either way, as well. While Frasier and Martin are the ones going to the Farmer's Market, Martin says ""serve the Duchess"" which could mean Niles or Frasier. What are everyone's thoughts on this? Would Daphne be serving the food in this late-season instance? If it'd be Frasier, then Niles would be the Duchess. I think breaking down and analyzing this reference would be more of a worthy venture than citing every effeminate thing they've each done throughout 11 seasons and weighing them against each other."
Frasier,2kq513,K3R3G3,1 point,Thu Oct 30 15:05:38 2014 UTC,"I think in this example, Martin was just making fun of Frasier's desire for fancy food, using a hypothetical ""duchess"" recipient to mock Frasier's pretentiousness. Basically saying, ""you're not making food for royalty, don't rush me."""
Frasier,2kq513,theworldbystorm,1 point,Thu Oct 30 19:02:22 2014 UTC,"I guess that's possible. But I personally believe it's much less likely, especially since Martin refused to elaborate in the scene I cited and later in the series refers to Niles and Frasier as ""the duke and duchess."""

Niles has a million eccentricities, but he's not a simple, one-dimensional character thrown in just because. It takes a special kind of talent to write a character like Niles and keep him interesting and relevant for 11 seasons. And of course David Hyde Pierce's unmatched talent in physical comedy makes Niles even more colorful and funny.  As for Roz? She is a single, attractive, independent woman who often puts Fras in his place with her street smarts, a character masterfully written in 90's before today's obnoxious ""YES I'M A WOMAN AND I'M STRONG"" trend in entertainment industry which unnecessarily rubs it in our face.

Frasier,2j186o,johnyutah,-5,Mon Oct 13 03:32:26 2014 UTC,He came out a long time ago. David Hyde Pierce is also gay.  Kelsey Grammar was the only straight actor in the family.
Frasier,2j186o,Spinetablet,5,Tue Oct 14 09:56:17 2014 UTC,I know DHP is gay but I thought it was just speculation with John Mahoney. Any chance you can find some source on this?
Frasier,2j186o,johnyutah,-4,Tue Oct 14 16:36:55 2014 UTC,"Haven't looked for a source but I've read it elswhere.  Also, Dan Butler (Bulldog) is gay.  Come to think of it, Frasier is basically the only actor on the show who likes women."

Frasier,2j0fwr,Twiggy3,-6,Fri Oct 17 16:35:30 2014 UTC,"Daphne becomes a complete bitch after they get together, completely overreacting to everything.  But I guess that's one way of covering the fact her character has no point any more."

Frasier,2hnoss,Axadarm,2,Wed Oct 1 23:07:42 2014 UTC,I was always curious as to why he was fired. Kenny was always shown to be a guy who did not like confrontations or someone that liked to fire anyone (as shown with Frasier) so I've always assumed the decision to off him had to have come from the higher-ups. Considering their future interactions together it just doesn't seem like it was something Kenny personally decided. I know we can just chock it up to plot reasons but his show was always stated to be in the same league as Frasier's in popularity but somehow it just sank at some point years later since they said his numbers weren't good anymore?
Frasier,2hnoss,Ccracked,1 point,Fri Oct 3 02:23:53 2014 UTC,"One of the great mysteries of Frasier, how Kenny could never stand up to the likes of Frasier but suddenly found the gall to terminate 'Bulldog' Briscoe's employment.

Frasier,2hcukv,FromZtoB,10,Wed Sep 24 19:04:55 2014 UTC,I imagine maybe they still had access to raw footage from the other cameras from the filming of the original episodes - or they were planning far enough ahead to specifically shoot those angles to use years later.
Frasier,2hcukv,waterboatman,6,Wed Sep 24 22:15:38 2014 UTC,Computer trickery to put present Niles and Frasier into old footage.  Old scenes seen from new angles were simply recreated and recorded specifically for this episode.

She's great in my eyes because you literally see her reinvent herself into a success.   She was going down a dead end career and took a chance to change. Frasier gave her the boost by being a guest producer sure, but everything else was all her.   I fucking love that. I love that this show features so many successful women."

Frasier,2h6i2c,beaucauchemar,1 point,Tue Sep 23 20:27:39 2014 UTC,Probably will be a while for it to wind up on a tap depending of course on how well the soft-launch goes.

Frasier,2fyx9p,Thomas_Wayne_,2,Wed Sep 10 11:25:49 2014 UTC,I was watching the same episode yesterday! So many funny moments. I believe they had two more episodes in later seasons with similar misunderstandings. One where Martin pretends to be gay with Niles as his lover to avoid dating a woman and later her gay friend and one episode where Frasier refuses to tell a famous director (played by Patrick Stewart) he's not gay because he loves the life he's experiencing with him.

Then there was this scene with this scruffy boy being handed a brand-new pair of shoes by the Salvation Army.  Frasier, if you saw the look on that boy's face.

So I bought what I really wanted - a forty eight foot cabin cruiser.  Want to know how much it cost me? I'll tell you how much it cost me: three hundred grand, not to mention the twenty thousand for the custom teak decking.  Now, here's my problem: the wife wants to call this incredible vessel Lulubelle, after her mother.  Lulubelle!  So I say,""no, we call it the Intrepid.""  So what do you think it should be called? Lulubelle or the Intrepid?  Frasier: [after a beat] Roger, at Cornell University they have an incredible piece of scientific equipment known as the tunneling electron microscope.  Now, this microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons you can actually see images of the atom, the infinitesimally minute building blocks of our universe.

Frasier was aired here in Australia very sporadically, so was hard to follow. Reading the lines in my head gave a very good experience because, as you said, I already knew what the actors looked like and how they would usually act physically and such, but because I could add my own inflections to their voices, or how I thought they would say them was a unique experience. Felt very much like a director working on their dream project where everything came out exactly as planned.  Your experience of listening to them reminds me of my own experience with them now, as I usually have it playing on one monitor while I am doing stuff on the other monitor - my vision is focussed on the other screen, but I am listening to Frasier at the same time. I guess playing it in the car makes it more like a radio drama... and we all know how those turn out ;)"

I don't watch the video since I'm driving, but I listen to it and since I've seen every episode many times, I can visualize it very well. I will say that a little something is lost because when I actually watch an episode on my TV I notice all of the little gestures made by the actors that do not come across in just the audio.

Frasier,2dp6tj,kinotek,7,Sat Aug 16 04:48:57 2014 UTC,"I never really liked Niles and Daphne as a couple to be honest. Mostly because of the fact that they really didn't have that much in common and were completely different people which made it hard to take their relationship serious. And the entire way they ended up together really bothered since I thought it was honestly poorly executed.  Daphne had zero interest in Niles other then seeing him as a good friend and showed no inklings of any romantic interest in him outwardly or inherently throughout the seasons leading up to them hooking up. Her whole big moment was finding out that he liked/loved her for all those years then she suddenly decided she feelings for him? Give me a break, there's an actual term for manifested feelings like that (the word eludes me regrettably) and it's something you would expect from a teenager or from a kid sitcom. She ended emotionally destroying a good guy (Donnie) who by all accounts was the best man she ever dated and they worked great as a believable couple.  To surmise it OMG HE LIKED ME ALL THESE YEARS...I THINK I LIKE HIM NOW IMG WHAT DO I DO!?  Niles - to put it bluntly in Frasier's own words when he called him out on the very subject of his suppose love for her - was ""in love at her"", not with her. I'm sure many will disagree but to me Niles was like many people in real-life who fancied a person from afar for so long that they built them up as someone they weren't since they really didn't know them that well in a romantic sense and was in love at the image he had conceived of her. It has been implied many times too in the series that before Maris Niles really hadn't been with many other women and certainly never in a serious relationship so honestly his entire devotion and so-called love for Daphne throughout the years is even more tainted since it was all coming from a man who really hadn't experienced much in dating, love or women in general.   I also didn't like how once they were together some of Nile's snobbishness started rubbing off on her. She changed from that upbeat, quirky home care worker that we all love into a much more arrogant and dry person once she shacked up with Niles. The only consolation was Niles started to lose some of his stiffness and self-entitled personality and very slowly became a more open-minded person much like the Cheers gang helped Frasier in his Boston years."
Frasier,2dp6tj,Axadarm,1 point,Sat Aug 16 12:11:50 2014 UTC,Both of those instances I am quite familiar with and both can be surmised as basic horniness. The one with Sherry she even said she just needed to do it to cool off (not literally since it was hot in that apt with the AC out) and the other took place in the very early seasons and there was no romantic interest there.
Frasier,2dpf5x,thratty,12,Sat Aug 16 07:02:47 2014 UTC,"I don't really hold that part in the hospital against her, I'd probably lose my shit as well. But in the later seasons, she does become a lot less of the lovable, quirky, kind hearted character everyone loved and turned into more of an entitled, impatient, shrill nuisance. The confusing and hilarious tangents she'd go off on, the way she communicated how she cared for everyone with the little things she did, and everything else that made her an awesome person seemed to appear less and less.  I think a good example is when she goes through Niles' patient's files because she thinks he's having an affair. That's seriously a fucked up thing to do to the patient who has placed so much trust in Niles, and reveals an unhealthy distrust for her husband. Also, the episodes where she puts on weight she's not exactly the most pleasant."
Frasier,2dpf5x,Darclite,11,Sun Aug 17 03:58:24 2014 UTC,"The thing you have to remember about Daphne is that, although its often referenced in jest, she came from a horribly dysfunctional and abusive household.  From what I can recall, her father had a stick that he'd hit the children with if they misbehaved.  He also crawled home from the pub drunk several nights a week.  Her mother once held her father's head under water during an argument.  They used to sing songs with names like ""Four Old Whores.""  One of her her brothers is a severe alcoholic.  Another was dropped as a child and has some sort of permanent speech impediment.  Daphne herself used to be a petty criminal, once shoplifting an entire frozen turkey.    Also, Daphne probably has a diva attitude from being a child television actor.    So cut Daphne some slack.  She's seen some shit."

He has just moved his other chair into Martin's old spot and sees it as a 12 year victory since it's finally out of the house so he stands back to take in the whole apartment now empty. He's elated at first because of the chair being gone but as he stands there alone just looking at the big, empty apartment it just dawns on him how alone he is now. Daphne is with Niles and they're starting their own little family and Martin is now living his new wife - every person that used to share his home with him are long gone. To me it's just a really sad moment for the character and the audience as both are so used to seeing a lively house that's been the setting for so many great memories over the years.

Frasier,2dfqtq,nooneastern,3,Wed Aug 13 15:11:08 2014 UTC,"I remember a heartbreaking example from the pilot, when Fras yells at his Dad for not saying thank you since he took him in, and there's this pause and a hesitated look on Martin's face. It's not long, and maybe it's not the best example for this discussion but please just think about what's on Martin's mind during that pause.  He used to be a proud and self-sufficient person, a cop who provided for his family and raised two great sons. Then he lost his wife and his badge, he is now dependent on his sons and a healthcare provider. Not the best turn of events for anyone.  It's not that he doesn't appreciate his single son who wanted a fresh start taking him in and giving him a room, but saying thank you at that particular moment would be like an admission of defeat.

This goes beyond romanticizing the work done of Frasier, the show's script lacks both the will and the creativity to expand upon the tried and true tropes of the past in an attempt to construct something genuinely entertaining.  Do not encourage this show, everyone on it deserves better. Use your power as a viewer to tell them that."
Frasier,2cn8pf,TheFridayKnight,5,Sun Aug 10 14:30:39 2014 UTC,"I watched the first two episodes and I'm not impressed.  It's simply not funny.  The characters are forced and the acting second rate.  Even the two stars look like they are going through the motions, they both deserve better."
Frasier,2cn8pf,pmwap,2,Sun Aug 10 16:52:50 2014 UTC,Grammar was on Craig Ferguson's show and didn't seem too thrilled in his two sentences about the show.

However, several words were left out, probably due to a transcription error, or maybe Grammer botched the line but it was good enough to keep.  Also, Kelsey Grammer's pronunciation was quite off, but part of the problem was probably the way it had been written down for him.

Each camera has a different shot, i.e. closeup, two shot, master. 'Frasier' is shot on film, not on videotape.""   If it was shot on film, there is a good chance it could be remastered to HD. If not, I still want the original quality on Bluray, just so I don't have to switch discs constantly. :P"
Frasier,2bciv0,tory_boy_,2,Tue Jul 22 11:23:07 2014 UTC,The last two seasons were shot in HD and are available on Netflix in the USA.  As I'm in the UK I have to access Netflix via a VPN to watch them.  I can't buy them in HD from Amazon USA and Amazon UK doesn't have them.  Very frustrating.
Frasier,2bciv0,chronaden,2,Tue Jul 22 16:07:21 2014 UTC,"I am pretty sure that, that's just upscaled material from the normal SD source."
Frasier,2bciv0,Axadarm,1 point,Tue Jul 22 06:41:43 2014 UTC,Not too many of the older sitcoms get a BR release so I wouldn't be too hopeful. Maybe a LE kinda set could come out sometime. I actually own the entire series but would definitely spring for it if one ever surfaced.

Frasier,2au5ry,DownvoteEqualsAgree,12,Wed Jul 16 06:18:44 2014 UTC,"Seeing your pretend girlfriend get married is no reason to kill yourself. In fact, it's a very healthy development which lets you break free from a hopeless fantasy and move on. If they were in a relationship at a time, and Daphne dumped him to get married with Donny, it would be way more devastating.  In Daphne Returns, where Fras dissects Niles and Daphne's relationship, he explains the situation perfectly in my opinion. From the moment he met her, Niles had genuine and unconditional feelings for Daphne, that goes without saying, but it was all in his mind. He loved her from a distance, never spoke to her about his feelings, never dated her, never slept with her. Only when Frasier let it slip did Daphne realize Niles' feelings, and developed feelings of her own."
Frasier,2au5ry,besyuziki,3,Wed Jul 16 09:57:58 2014 UTC,I would rather she marry Clive.

Frasier,2au5ry,Twiggy3,2,Wed Jul 16 12:17:40 2014 UTC,Jane Leeves who plays Daphne is actually British. Albeit not from Manchester which is the accent she has in the first few seasons before she goes to her normal voice.
Frasier,2au5ry,JoeyJo-JoJnrShabadoo,3,Wed Jul 16 12:22:28 2014 UTC,"I am British and her accent grates me. In fact all of the British accents on the show are truly terrible, but I guess they have exacerbated them to fit the cultural stereotype. John does a much better Mancunian accent in one episode, mainly because he's from Lancashire originally."
Frasier,2au5ry,DoctorSteve,2,Wed Jul 16 16:56:26 2014 UTC,And yet the show is incredibly popular in the UK. I wonder how the accent issue goes over there.

I mean, think about it....you can tell that he's being directed on some level throughout the series, and that includes when he's sitting still. Eddie (Moose) was a show business dog, point blank."
Frasier,2aim59,DarcyLefroy,3,Wed Jul 16 13:34:24 2014 UTC,I don't believe that. Of course it was a real dog.

Frasier,2aim59,setmehigh,2,Mon Jul 21 19:29:36 2014 UTC,"First, no there was no animatronic Eddie. IIRC, Eddie was primarily played by a dog called Moose from Florida. There were other dogs used as stand ins including one of Moose's sons in later years.  Second, I was going to write a long comment on the post about FrasierPhiles (but I no longer see it in this subreddit, am I missing it) about how disappointed I was with it, and you have illustrated my primary complaint. The creators had an awesome opportunity to make a really entertaining informative podcast, but instead they apparently want to use it for their own brand of ""humor"" which I assume they would describe as ""satire"" or something with Frasier as the background.  It's really disappointing to me because I was really looking forward to a show with good information about Frasier, but instead 80% of the crap they say is either made up or just plain wrong and it leads to people like OP not knowing what to believe since it's all presented as true. I feel sorry for people who might be Frasier fans, but don't know enough to know these guys are talking crap because they'll look like fools if they take the information at face value and ever repeat it.  I mean the crap about Kelsey living on set/wearing flesh colored rubber gloves, meeting DHP for the first time in real life, Jane Leeves practicing ocult, something about there being a statement about terrorism vs the Space Needle, an animatronic Eddie, ugh it's all complete rubbish.  Also unfortunate, is that the FrasierPhiles hosts didn't even include really good information when they could have, like why the show wound up set in Seattle, how the characters were cast, how the storylines were formed, heck, even how KACL got its call letters. With all the blabbering they did about ""the holy trinity"" they could have at least including some good information on them.  I was so excited when I heard about the podcast (envisioned something like Mission Log but for Frasier) and then so disappointed with what the show actually is, I almost want to make my own Frasier podcast now.  So I guess this turned into my long post, I'll probably repost something similar if I see a specific FrasierPhiles topic again in this subreddit.  TLDR; The FrasierPhiles podcast is terrible and a badly blown opportunity at a quality and informative show about Frasier. The hosts are spreading misinformation about Frasier. I can only assume they are doing this because they think they're being funny... but they're not."
Frasier,2aim59,droopyGT,4,Thu Jul 17 21:56:34 2014 UTC,"My sentiments EXACTLY. I'm SO glad someone else is calling them out on their bullshit/horrible humor. They even said John Mahoney is YOUNGER than Kelsey Grammer at one point, if my memory serves me well... Utter bullshit, the entire podcast. And the fact that it's just that sprinkled over the episode played in the background with nothing else is utterly disappointing.   Their Facebook posted a really bad photoshop of Eddie in Stan Winston's workshop. facepalm"

Granted, Niles and Frasier live in Seattle and enjoy its cultural events ect., but many episodes deal with the mismatch between them and 'ordinary people'. So Seattle could be a 'normal city' with people from every walk of life and still fit the show.

Frasier,28yhhs,Slawg3r_777,6,Tue Jun 24 11:44:36 2014 UTC,"Daphne had a history with Clive. They were going to get married, as made apparent when her fear of commitment was made known. This was when she found out Donnie was going to propose to her and she had her visions that cause second thoughts.  Anyway, Daphne and Clive obviously had very strong feelings for each other and what I can infer is that all of Daphne's feelings came rushing back when she saw Clive again after so many years. Those feelings temporarily overpowered her feelings for Joe. It can happen.   This is just my interpretation. I don't know if they put this much thought into it and just made a mistake or if this was actually their intention."

Frasier,28p220,sarah_cate1,6,Sat Jun 21 03:50:43 2014 UTC,"In reality, he wouldn't have heard Frasier, that's literally the definition of a sensory deprivation chamber. The thing is Frasier was produced as a stage play where in some circumstances characters can hear others, and sometimes they can't. The biggest example of this is Frasier's front door. Sometimes characters can hear what's going on inside the apartment (Lilith) and sometimes (often) they can't.  IMO, in the episode in question it would have been better if they called it some sort of dark/sauna/therapy box instead of a sensory deprivation tank which has a real meaning."

I always figured the only things on the left side were Frasier's bedroom and the main communal bathroom, with Daphne and Martin's rooms being located on the right side."

Frasier,2890jv,clarkee,-1,Fri Jun 20 18:38:34 2014 UTC,The laundry is downstairs. Any laundry that goes back that way is clean laundry going to Daphne's room.

It's probably the only episode I've skipped over during my many repeat viewings of the series.  I watch Frasier for comic relief and a happy escape. This episode is just a little too serious and slightly depressing.  Still, I do laugh everytime: Martin: ""We've got a stuck Chunky."" Roz: ""Well why did Chunky stick his arm in there?"""

Frasier,2827gn,Pleasant_Jim,10,Mon Jun 30 18:24:47 2014 UTC,Nope.  I never thought that at all.  What I do credit the writers for is allowing her character to adapt to her socioeconomic status.  She goes from a working class woman to wealth.  It's a classic British character arc.
Frasier,2827gn,sfvanlon5,4,Fri Jun 13 22:05:55 2014 UTC,"She certainly lost her edge in the later seasons. Once her mother came, it seems everything went downhill. Her quirkiness went away and she never smiled anymore. I think that the marriage to Niles also contributed to it; she seemed much more entitled. Regardless, I missed the old Daphne. I always enjoy re-watching the early seasons, because Daphne was one of my favourite characters. It really saddens me how much she changed, not only due to the enjoyment of her character, but also because the show took a downturn at the same time she changed."
Frasier,2827gn,uosa11,4,Tue Jul 1 08:45:03 2014 UTC,"Definitely, but well before the character got married. Becomes much more argumentative and insulting towards all three Cranes. Also did things like breaking into Niles' confidential files and hunted down after one of his patients."

Frasier,2827gn,droopyGT,2,Wed Aug 27 19:16:56 2014 UTC,"That's a perfect example. That episode had a horrible moral actually, she breaks into his private files which puts him at risk of losing his license to practice but he ends up apologising to her, forgiving her completely for irrational and selfish behaviour."

They keep bringing it up for weeks.  Similarly, Daphne alone gave Roz a really hard time about being in love with Santa Clause. If you watch that scene Roz seems really upset that Daphne wouldn't let it go."
Frasier,2827gn,Twiggy3,2,Wed Jun 18 16:31:28 2014 UTC,My girlfriend doesn't like that Santa Claus scene either. She said Daphne's character had completely changed by that point and it isn't the real Daphne.

The long brown haired woman behind him and to the right (actually ""Tina Dalton"", one fo Frasier's exes whom he suspects to be his secret admirer) is holding back laughter each time he says it.

Frasier,26q2e6,peanutismint,15,Wed May 28 19:58:59 2014 UTC,"A bit of background on this scene from Frasier co-creator David Lee was given over at Ken Levine's Blog:   Several thoughts from David Lee.  Prize goes to the poster who said it reminded him/her of Mr. Bean. I had recently been introduced to his work and loved a lot of it. I told DHP that I would like to do something like that for him on the show. Couldn't really come up with anything for a while (we didn't want to crib the ""turkey on the head"" bit,though that wasn't a concern of another sit-com on the air at the time. I do remember in the room having trouble breaking a Valentine story and hitting upon the idea of doing three short stories instead. Two of them involved every character except Niles, so the idea of something for him alone came up. Then the Mr. Bean thought, and then the fire idea. I remember distinctly that once we hit upon that, the details of it came together very, very quickly in the room.  Because of safety concerns, the scene was filmed without the usual studio audience. ( It was played to a studio audience later, and those are the laughs you hear). It also had to be done in bits and pieces. The problem is, when there is only one person on stage, what do you cut to? That's where the dog came in--not out of an attempt to be cutsie--but rather to be able to piece it all together.  And of course, as many have said, none of it would have worked without the brilliance of DHP. A wonder he is.  And to the poster who wondered who would make all those mistakes with an iron, fire extinguisher and cleaning materials: how about someone who never or seldom uses them? A side note now that my memory has been shaken: This was the episode that caused a showdown with the network. We had been complaining that they were giving away plot points and great jokes in their promos for quite awhile, and we knew that every promo would for this episode would be nothing but flames galore. So we did not deliver this piece of it until the day of broadcast. Apoplectic, they were. Lawsuits threatened, even. But they finally came up with a better promo that said something like ""The producers of Frasier think this episode is so special, they won't even let us see it.""  Now back to my couch."
Frasier,26q2e6,droopyGT,3,Wed May 28 20:03:04 2014 UTC,That is some great background information from a great source. Good find!
Frasier,26q2e6,Indydegrees2,3,Wed May 28 21:09:57 2014 UTC,Fun story: I laughed so hard the first time I seen this scene my neighbours called to my house to make sure everything was okay!

I put almost in quotations because now I'm not sure if the seller actually had a version with legit (not photocopied) autographs in the first place. Basically the auction ended and even though I technically didn't win (got sniped with <10 seconds to go) I almost immediately got a 'second chance' email with a link to a relisting of the item. However, the seller had changed the description to now say that he was selling a copy, not an original. I don't know about you, but having copies of autographs seems pointless to me, so I passed.  At this point I'm not sure if the original ever existed, or was actually for sale or what."

Frasier,24u7ls,pantsoff,22,Tue May 6 04:28:50 2014 UTC,"No. I think it ended well. Some shows stay on long past their best of date. Just toward the end, Frasier was getting there. There are only so many new and funny stories you can tell with the same cast of characters. They start to repeat after a while.   If you don't repeat stories, then you have to get even more and more outrageous situations. Look at The Simpsons for example. Had that show ended after the movie came out, it would have gone out as one of the best shows of all time. Instead, they've kept it on and torture it each week. It's not even funny or interesting any more. I watch it, but just because I'm so invested in it. It feels more like a chore.   Anyway, that's where Frasier would be if they brought it back. Plus, the show fit so well in the 90s. The beige colors, skinny ties and padded shoulder suits, the coffee shop motif of everything, talk radio, etc. It just wouldn't fit the modern era.   I love Frasier. I've binged watched it a few times all the way through over the years. But bringing it back would just water down what made it so good. It was a 90s show.   Plus, like I said, half the fun is gone. Niles married Daphney. The funniest episodes were him fawning over her and try to handle Merris at the same time. All of Frasier's hopeless romances and both of them trying to climb to Seattle social ladder to no avail. That's what made Frasier so good. But you can only beat that dead horse so many times before people turn it off.     I think they should make another ""smart"" comedy in the spirit of Frasier. The Big Bang Theory started out like that, but it's been watered down so much the last few seasons, it's just a lot of nerd jokes. It started out with a lot science and physic humor, but it's been reduced to just sex jokes. That happens with all good shows. They start by playing to a niche. Soon, they start water down the material so it appeals to a larger audience. Next thing you know, they're just playing to the lowest common denominator and the original charm is gone.   If you watch a lot of reruns, Frasier season 1 and 2 get played a lot. Why? Because those were the best. That's when the show still knew what it was and the whole concept was fresh. By season 9 and 10, it started to drag. Only the Niles/Daphney relationship is what kept it going. But by doing that, they killed one of the best parts. Like I said, Niles obsessing over her and her being oblivious was probably the best recurring joke of the whole show. Now it's gone.   No, Frasier is over. Bringing it back would just be painful I think. The actors are passed their prime and watching them trying to be funny and eccentric again would be awkward.   As I said before though, I'd like to see a ""Frasier inspired"" show though. A lot of shows are focused on DC and politics lately; House of Cards, Alpha House, Veep, etc. Maybe a high brow political comedy? Like, if you took the funny parts of The West Wing and made a show like that. Can't be about the White House though, that's been done to tears. Both Alpha House and House of Cards were about Congress. Maybe then local government? Shit... that's Parks and Rec. Maybe a legal comedy then. The Supreme Court or the DC Court of Appeals? Might work."
Frasier,24u7ls,weRborg,5,Tue May 6 09:30:13 2014 UTC,"I completely agree. Just been rewatching my season 1-4 disks and season 5 on youtube. It's exactly the underlying tension between Niles and Daphne that make so many episodes so brilliant. I fear the moment these two will get together (season 7? 8?) and see the source of all those misunderstandings gone. The show got pretty shitty after that. Iirc it was done to attract more female viewers, but it was a bad mistake if you liked the comedy."
Frasier,24u7ls,jippiejee,10,Tue May 6 13:20:11 2014 UTC,"I disagree; the show didn't get shitty when Daphne and Niles got together.  The nature of their relationship changed and there were plenty of great storylines exploring their new dynamic.  From a story-telling stand point, you don't lead an audience on for 7+ years without giving them some satisfaction.  I don't think they could have strung out Niles pining for Daphne any longer.  In my personal opinion, the show got stale because 95% of the character's problems were based on lying to each other.  I recently watched the series a couple times through and was astounded at just how many of their problems could be avoided by having one simple conversation."
Frasier,24u7ls,Mr_Boombalatty,1 point,Tue May 6 19:13:41 2014 UTC,"because 95% of the character's problems were based on lying to each other   This is not unique to Frasier. I realized several years ago that this is pretty much the basis of almost all sitcom episodes. It's because in real life people talk/work things out without going through far-fetched antics, but that's boring. Next time you're watching almost any sitcom, stop and ask yourself if this episode could take place if the characters were honest with each other? Probably not. Obviously some shows use this more or less than others, but the amount it pops up is huge. For me it's one of those things that I now recognize all the time, since I first noticed it."
Frasier,24u7ls,droopyGT,9,Mon May 19 22:25:50 2014 UTC,"As somebody who loved the show even more after Niles and Daphne got together, I'd love to have had a one-off reunion special about Frasier and Charlotte coming back to Seattle to have their wedding there. There's so, so much you can do without just focusing on will they/won't they romantic tension(many episodes reflect this)."
Frasier,24u7ls,Planet-man,4,Tue May 6 18:21:31 2014 UTC,No but a Niles spinoff wouldn't be so bad
Frasier,24u7ls,kevcops,3,Tue May 6 16:13:19 2014 UTC,That would make it a spin-off of a spin-off. I wonder if that has been done before.

Frasier,24u7ls,Drusss,2,Tue May 6 16:22:24 2014 UTC,I was surprised how few episodes or time was given to his relationship between Frasier and his son Fredrick. I thought since Frasier bonded with his father so late in their lives he would possible have his son stay with him during the holidays or whatever. I don't think the actor who played Fredrick had the talent really to play a major cast member but that relationship could or should have been given more screen time than they did.

Frasier,24l40p,amrith777,1 point,Sat May 3 13:30:08 2014 UTC,"That did cross my mind and it is pretty possible. I will listen to it tonight. Sutherland's work is just about universally liked and praised. And, as my more seasoned opera-loving friend stated, people either love or hate Callas. She has excellent emotion/expression, but does not have the most refined sound. This is why some really like her while others can't get over the fact that her voice isn't the typical definition of ""beautiful"". The same friend (I really trust his knowledge for good reason) also said that fans tend to be rather polarized on the matter. Specifically, those who love Tebaldi strongly dislike Callas and vice versa. This is kind of why I'm thinking it's not Callas - because they're in the same group in that respect. Also, in the same argument that is likely not Callas, though I'm not certain, I think Callas was somewhat more famous than Tebaldi, partially due to her extremely ""diva""-type personality, both on and off stage. Again, some people strongly liked this while others strongly didn't. If I happen to see the friend, though unlikely to happen anytime soon, he'll be able to identify the singer in about 2 seconds if I play that part of the episode."

I always found it to be odd and unnecessary when they were trying to inject stories into the same timeline we've already watched, knowing their hair didn't look that way at the time. I sort of understand for the men as Niles' thinned and Frasier's got cut short in early season 3, but the women's were never as dark as their wigs and I think it looked stupid."

Frasier,24iq5l,Pippen1984,1 point,Fri May 2 11:02:40 2014 UTC,I believe they wanted to emphasize the different looks the cast had had throughout the show.

The way he looks at Kelsey so seriously and straight-faced and with quite a bit of sincerity, and then you realise he's supposed to be Jeanne Tripplehorn, and you wonder just how Hoskins (or Kelsey for that matter) kept a straight face the entire time. Such a shame about his passing - a truly talented actor who had such great range (that clip of him acting entirely alone for Roger Rabbit was awesome). I loved that even for his most comedic roles, he could bring a certain gravitas to it without even trying (yes, even in Super Mario Bros).  On a side note: Frasier's comment about how when you're a kid, any attention to you feels like you're being singled out resonated with me quite a bit, also."

The fact that that is the second time he does it in that scene, when Niles returns with his Maris dilemma, and he does it with more gusto, makes it much better.   I don't think I can choose one, but the quickly spoken, almost staccato-like ""Very well, thanks for dropping by, off you go!"" with the blatant and deliberately dismissive hand gesture is just fantastic."
Frasier,23hqfj,JimmyAxel,2,Sun Apr 20 05:41:28 2014 UTC,"Can't remember the episode, but there's one when frasier is trying to brush off Roz and she finally gets the hint and says ""right... Off I go!""  I crack up every time."

Frasier,22e4rc,GuyWhoCallsYouBill,5,Mon Apr 7 02:52:59 2014 UTC,I noticed Season 11 was out of order and reported it via Netflix chat.  Hopefully they fix it soon.

Frasier,22e4rc,AgentMaxPower,4,Mon Apr 7 06:56:50 2014 UTC,I watch frasier on Netflix religiously and I can confirm this.  I try to watch the episodes tying into each other in order and I will start the first and then the second that showed up before is not there anymore.  It's weird how that works.  Sometimes I will watch really early episodes like season 1 or 2 and then after an episode only the later seasons are available (seasons 9 and on).
Frasier,22e4rc,Tabby888,3,Mon Apr 7 04:24:10 2014 UTC,I hadn't noticed until I saw this. I know it hasn't always been like this. I watch it on netflix nearly every day. I know the last time I was on season 7 (probably a few months ago) it was correct. Honestly though at this point I just hit play and enjoy whichever episode it happens to be. I don't even usually pay attention to what episode it is anymore.
Frasier,22e4rc,ingo174,3,Mon Apr 7 05:27:29 2014 UTC,"Lol, I just reported this to the Netflix team on Tuesday before I saw this post.

Frasier,22e4rc,bangwhimper,1 point,Tue Apr 8 01:08:55 2014 UTC,"I noticed this problem a few weeks ago. I can guarantee that it wasn't always like this because I've been watching Frasier for a few years on Netflix. It's hard to imagine how it would get broken after it was already correct.  There is also an episode that ends prematurely and does something weird like cut in a scene from another episode. I can't remember which one for sure, but it's around when they are at Kirby's graduation party at Lorna/Lana's house. I think it's when  Frasier is in her bedroom and asks her not to use the ""F"" word. This was also not broken originally, but it was the last time I watched. I'll post separately if I come across it again."

Frasier,20rkra,hrdputty,20,Wed Mar 19 00:03:05 2014 UTC,"If you mean Martin's seatbelt, I believe that should be accurate as depicted. Frasier usually drove a 7 series I think, and assuming it was the current model year (1995), the belts came from the middle and buckled on the outside. At least according to this  Imgur link for the specific photo: http://imgur.com/QP2N590  EDIT: haha gold? had no idea what reddit was talking about when it said I could go to the lounge. thanks!"
Frasier,20rkra,KingPing-SA,6,Wed Mar 19 00:35:10 2014 UTC,"That's close, but not exactly right. He actually had a newer generation 7-series in the late episodes like Enemy at the Gate, but in this episode he had an E34 5-series. Here is the back seat of an E34 5-series. Later in the show, he upgraded to the next generation, the E39 5-series. Finally, in the latest episodes, he got the biggest BMW and the next generation again, the E65 7-series.   I am quite sure all these have seatbelts that come from the center.   There's also a very good chance all BMWs have this, at least in the last 20 years or so. I'm pretty sure about that, but not 100%.  Sources: Google Images, I love BMWs, and I actually owned an E34 5-series, the car in the original post. It definitely had seatbelts coming from the center."
Frasier,20rkra,K3R3G3,3,Wed Mar 19 19:38:56 2014 UTC,"I think you're correct about Frasier having a 5-series in this episode, because in the scene with Kate ""Dirty Girl"" Costas, before she boards her plane for Chicago, Frasier tells her that his favorite color is, ""Arctic Silver. It's available on all the big BMWs."" If he had a ""big 7-series"" he probably would have said, ""... available on cars like mine.""   One has to wonder, then, why his later-in-the-series 12-cylinder 760 wasn't Arctic Silver."
Frasier,20rkra,K3R3G3,3,Thu Mar 20 04:53:35 2014 UTC,"That's interesting and I do remember that part. It's funny how he says arctic silver. The photo of the black one I posted, which is a screenshot from the same episode that you posted, is absolutely an E34 5-series. The 7-series he later has is probably not a 760. Probably, a 745 or 750. The 760 is the flagship model, tends to stand out more in appearance, and was very rare, especially early on when that episode aired in 2002 (the 1st year for that model). I could be wrong because I'm most familiar w/post-2005 7-series, but it'd be unusual for the show to opt for the most expensive one available."
Frasier,20rkra,K3R3G3,5,Thu Mar 20 08:01:53 2014 UTC,"I remember an episode where Martin and Frasier are chasing Niles in his rent-a-car during the time of Niles' separation, and Martin tells Frasier, ""Catch him, Mr. Twelve Cylinder German engineering!""  But, like a lot of things in this show, there were a lot of inconsistencies in the details that we fan(atics) like to pick apart!"
Frasier,20rkra,Kalimyre,4,Thu Mar 20 08:11:17 2014 UTC,"That's funny because I actually pointed that out in another thread as an error. At the time, he had the E34 540i, which is the 8-cylinder. That's the E34 he seems to have each time although it sounds much more like a 525i in the episode you posted (smaller 6-cylinder (2.5L), as opposed to a larger one (3.5L in the 535I) or a the 8 in the 540). They probably used a 525 just that once or added in another car sound. In summary, Martin was wrong because no 5-series has come with a 12-cylinder and Frasier was driving an E34 5-series."

Frasier,1zvlrs,Chanz,4,Sat Mar 8 20:40:59 2014 UTC,"Haha thank you, but there's a good chance other(s) on here know more than I do. Certainly, different stuff. I'm glad your comment is up top and, thus, the majority agrees. Faye is the one. The only reason they broke up is because of Frasier repeatedly calling her Cassandra by mistake, and Faye then meeting Cassandra. It's a damn shame. They had no issues and she was gorgeous, hot, fun, funny, a pastry chef at one of Frasier's absolute favorite restaurants (serendipity, indeed), knowledgeable about food and art, and got along well with everyone. Even Daphne took a liking to her, especially after Cassandra was disrespectful toward her.   Frasier often didn't know or do what was best for himself, especially in his love life. He should've quickly used some psychiatric techniques and exercises to nip the mistaken name problem in the bud, training himself to never say ""Cassandra"" again and call Faye by her correct name. He then should've avoided anywhere he might run into Cassandra while with Faye, like Cafe Nervosa, until a little time passed. Then, if Faye had met Cassandra, she likely would've thought nothing of it and just attributed it to the fabricated aunt. Poor Frasier. ""Forever Faye"" was an inacccurate prediction, but it sure would've been nice."

The brief exchange they had was really sweet IMO.  The Supermodel Frasier on the plane was great too! He spontaneously flies to Acapulco and she's on the plane! Don't remember her name though! Somebody?
Frasier,1zvlrs,K3R3G3,4,Mon Mar 10 04:46:36 2014 UTC,"One of my favorite episodes. Frasier decides that he is meeting Lorna soon to break it off with her, but when she arrives, she tells him she'll have to cancel their plans for tonight as she has to go to their high school Coach's reunion and wants Frasier to go with her. He, on the other hand, is trying to break it off with her but then realises all the popular students from his high school will be there. Frasier is relishing the look on their faces when they see 'Crane The Brain' walk in with the prom queen on his arm. How will Lorna react when Frasier tells her the truth just as they are about to go in....?  Lorna: You know, I thought you'd be a nice rebound fling, get my feet wet dating again, you don't want that, that's fine. But I'll tell you what we are going to do: you're going to take my arm, you're going to escort me in that room, we're going to dance, make out like freshmen and leave with your hand on my ass, you got it?   Frasier: Shall we?"

I personally actually like ""Beware of Greeks"". My favorite parts are the look/reaction by Niles when Frasier removes the wine bottles he's hiding behind and when Niles meets Yvon again, ""It's good to see your two again too...""  I do think having Martin have a brother in the episode is the major problem though. This part of the family should have been tied in some other way. Despite family squabbles, it's just not believable that Martin has a brother in the same city who he never talks to."

Frasier,1yydim,K3R3G3,3,Wed Feb 26 03:00:10 2014 UTC,"Since no one else has posted yet, I guess I can start by saying a few things. I felt that it was a well done, unusual movie with just the right number of plot twists -- not a film in which there are 20+ of them just for the sake of being there and become a chore to keep track of.  I really enjoyed seeing DHP in a different light and hope to watch some more stuff starring him and Kelsey in the future.  I think DHP did very well and I experienced some of the same things I experienced on my first, and only other, viewing. Specifically, I very quickly (almost immediately) stopped seeing him as ""Niles"". I didn't think of the Niles character more than a couple times throughout my viewing which, especially considering the large number of times I've watched Frasier, I see as a testament to his acting skills. Additionally, after watching The Perfect Host, I watched a few Frasier episodes and seeing Niles actually freaked me out! I found it unsettling because I felt like he was still Warwick and was hiding his true, very dangerous, and very mentally unstable character. I see this, again, as evidence of how well he did in the film.  I don't think it was one of the best movies I have ever seen, but I did enjoy it and felt it was quite well done. Regardless, I feel like this viewing was more about seeing DHP take on a different role.  The film was pretty stressful, which I think was one of its purposes. (IMDB Genres: Crime, Comedy, Thriller) I enjoyed how it was revealed that Warwick knew all along that John was full of shit and was in control of the situation 99% of the time. He didn't even need to let him into his home, but chose to do so to indulge his hobby of ""entertaining"". And I guess it doesn't hurt to have a real guest once in a while. I appreciate dark humor and this film had a good amount of it. One of my favorite comedic parts was when Warwick went to pick up John, who was tied to his chair, with the other side being manned by one of Warwick's imaginary/hallucinated friends. John knew he was going down, which he did, and the next camera angle was a close-up of his face as it was dragged, bouncing slightly and rapidly, across the floor. Probably the darkest humor part was when Warwick watched the Super 8 footage of him cutting himself, going on about what a great party it was, how he did his own makeup, etc.  Maybe that was a bit much for some people to see, but I won't know unless you comment!  So, what did others think of the film? David Hyde Pierce's role and performance? The ending? Your favorite parts? Etc, etc..."
Frasier,1yydim,darktask,2,Wed Feb 26 21:38:23 2014 UTC,"I really liked The Perfect Host!  I thought it was going to be Niles Crane crossed with Dexter but it wound up being so much better than that!   The dark humor aspects were well done, but the tension and then twist after delicious twist, it was all so original and smart. Really enjoyable movie, David Hyde Pierce was so impressive in that I forgot about Niles and was just fascinated by the farce."

Frasier,1yt3ac,hersheyboo03,11,Tue Feb 25 04:45:10 2014 UTC,"I agree with /u/thenepenthe. I've always figured Daphne did it on purpose because she wanted to stay.  I'm actually watching the episode right now. This is 6th season so she had been with them for 5 years and certainly felt close to them by then.  I think she spoke of her duty to care for someone who needed her more than Martin did rather spontaneously/rashly -- Ego, if we're going to go with Freud here -- and began looking for a new job. But then as time went on and she thought of it more, her desire to stay prevailed -- and her Id made Martin re-injure himself.   ""There are no accidents.""  -Frasier & Niles, throughout the series"
Frasier,1yrcbt,PoliticalGlutton,11,Mon Feb 24 02:55:29 2014 UTC,"I don't think that the boy's mannerisms, tastes and habits is inherited genetically. It's possible that since Hester was such a huge influence on both Leland and the boys that both picked up some common mannerisms."
Frasier,1yrcbt,17Hongo,4,Mon Feb 24 05:44:19 2014 UTC,The allergies is what makes it suspicious to me.
Frasier,1yrcbt,alchemeron,9,Mon Feb 24 06:31:07 2014 UTC,"Assuming, of course, that all of Niles' allergies are real and not mostly psychosomatic."
Frasier,1yrcbt,17Hongo,3,Mon Feb 24 17:34:31 2014 UTC,Hmm. I'm still sceptical.
Frasier,1yrcbt,knifeyspooney3,2,Mon Feb 24 06:39:59 2014 UTC,"Perhaps.  But the boys (particularly Frasier) look so much like Leland and so little like Martin, the tastes and mannerisms similarities add fuel to this fire."
Frasier,1yrcbt,busydoinnothin,17,Mon Feb 24 13:17:04 2014 UTC,"I don't believe Hester would have cheated twice with the same man and had 2 sons years apart. From what I understand, Martin knows who she cheated with, and by the end of the episode he believes that Leland did not have an affair with Hester. I wouldn't believe Hester to have had 2 separate affairs, one of which occurred twice after a few years, each consequently having Hester give birth to Frasier and Niles."
Frasier,1yrcbt,K3R3G3,9,Mon Feb 24 03:48:50 2014 UTC,"They reveal who she cheated with in the episode where Frasier/Niles see their father at the restaurant with the crying woman. It was from Season 1, Beloved Infidel. She has an affair with Marion Lawler's husband.   The OP's theory isn't that far fetched, IMO. Her admitted affair was with somebody her family knew, as is Leland."
Frasier,1yrcbt,alchemeron,1 point,Mon Feb 24 06:30:53 2014 UTC,"We don't know much about the early yeas of Martin and Hester's marriage. Yes, Martin is aware of one affair but that doesn't mean he knows about them all. Leland seems like a stand up guy who could keep the secret. He was young when working with Hester and as we learn kept many secrets about his sexuality. I believe it's quite believable he would also be able to remain quiet about this. Hester could have needed time to really fall in love with Martin. Remember, Frasier and Niles had a prickly relationship with him only getting closer as the years progressed."
Frasier,1yrcbt,K3R3G3,5,Mon Feb 24 13:23:18 2014 UTC,"I can understand Frasier, if you recall he was conceived before Martin and Hester got married. But to do it twice and have Niles as well?  It could be just Frasier, and Niles is really Martin's son...apparently they have more similarities than Frasier and Martin do..."
Frasier,1yrcbt,ADirtyHookahHose,2,Mon Feb 24 20:15:25 2014 UTC,"That's a good point. Although the similarity between Frasier and Niles is a big part of the charm of the show, Leland does match most closely with the elder Crane brother."
Frasier,1yrcbt,droopyGT,8,Mon Feb 24 20:53:18 2014 UTC,"Tho very possible, and perhaps true, I would argue that Martin still made a better father figure then Barton could ever hypothetically be for the Crane boys. Ultimately, i think this lends itself to why Hester marries Martin and keeps whatever the truth might be under the rug."
Frasier,1yrcbt,K3R3G3,1 point,Mon Feb 24 03:22:35 2014 UTC,"Agree. While I think she had a sexual relationship with Leland in the early years of their marriage, his homosexuality and Martins loyalty set up the family dynamic we all know and love."
Frasier,1yrcbt,alchemeron,3,Mon Feb 24 13:24:57 2014 UTC,"I've definitely thought this, think it every time I watch the episode, and believe it to be very possible. Leland is smart and just telling Martin that he's gay on his way out is a good idea. It's something that wouldn't hurt his reputation since he didn't even live nearby and no one can ask Hester to confirm (not that it'd matter because if she did cheat with him and were still alive, why wouldn't she cover it by lying again?)   Additionally, who is going to bother confirming it?  Only Martin was suspicious (and Roz but what's she going to do?) and he asked Leland in private in the hallway. Leland may not have said anything to Niles and Frasier about his sexuality and Martin probably wouldn't bring it up since he believed Leland right away and didn't really want to believe that Leland was their father. He was never one to discuss his feelings and get stuff that made him uncomfortable out in the open.  People who cheat tend to cheat repeatedly and maybe Hester just got better at keeping it under wraps. I saw someone comment, doubting they would've had an affair twice...they could have had sex 300 times and just got 2 kids out of it, passing them off as Martin's. It's not like tons of people were demanding paternity tests back in the 1950s. All the time they spent doing research together? Pair that with huge number of similarities, allergies, etc that you mentioned and I believe it is very, very possible.  Seriously, how are both he and Niles allergic to all those things like Jerusalem Artichokes? I've never even heard of them! Also, where did Frasier's baldness come from, considering Martin's full head of hair? And Martin is much shorter than Frasier and Niles, but Leland is tall.  Leland very well may have been attempting for many years to get up the courage to see his sons again, and not having seen them since their childhood, decided to pay them a visit which was that episode. He sure seemed to be very excited and happy throughout.   I think it's more likely that Leland is their biological father and is an interesting thing they put in the show. It gives an answer to why Frasier and Niles are so different from their father."
Frasier,1yrcbt,RPMcMikey,3,Mon Feb 24 16:35:11 2014 UTC,"Also, where did Frasier's baldness come from, considering Martin's full head of hair?   These traits are said to be inherited from the maternal grandfather."

And that despite how his life changed and all the progress he's made as a human being after being shot, he is still not at peace with what happened.  It is a one off, and rather out of place, but that's how I've always seen it."
Frasier,1y1fgk,DoctorSteve,5,Sun Feb 16 05:57:43 2014 UTC,"I always felt that there could be a story that could be expanded on there.  Like Martin coming to terms with what happened, or the guy redeeming himself some way."
Frasier,1y1fgk,Brontosaurus_Bukkake,4,Sun Feb 16 06:48:50 2014 UTC,I think the point is to show that but every issue in life can be made up for our gotten over. You don't always come to terms with some things completely no matter how much time has passed and not everyone deserves forgiveness.
Frasier,1y1fgk,Madzos,9,Sun Feb 16 20:35:47 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I always thought it was brilliant the way they dealt with Martin's plot in that episode. One of my favourite things the series has ever done.  It's obvious to say that his shooting was one of the worst experiences of his life (I hesitate to say ""the worst"" only because of losing his wife). It's something that he doesn't ever want to think about, and something that he avoids talking about in any real way with anyone, especially his sons - He doesn't want anyone to think about a time when he was ever scared or weak. He doesn't want to admit to himself that there was ever such a time. He hates the fact that this one day marked the moment that he went from being a real man - independent and strong, protecting the weak - to someone who need protection and help himself. And really, the boys don't want any of that emotional burden, either. But at the same time, it's there, it's unavoidable, it's had a massive effect on every aspect of his life. He just can't pretend it never happened. The boys may be able to tune it out, to get wrapped up in their own stories, but for Martin, it's always there. Always.  I love that the show took a moment to just hint at this. Giving us the full story, focusing an episode on it to make it a proper character arc, would have been too much. It would have felt crass, garish, after-school-special-y. But the subtle way it was done...just enough of a reminder of the brutal reality of his past...and of the way it's constantly suppressed...gives it more impact. It's haunting.  Martina can never really have closure to that part of his life, and the writers knew that. So we don't get it, either. We get the same unsatisfying, open-ended, rather hollow-feeling truth that Martin does."

I was convinced, the way to stay out of harms way was to walk the streets with me eyes cast down, never meeting anyone's glance. But, finally, I decided, that was no way to live. So, one day I just lifted up me chin and took it all in. Well, the change was amazing. There were sights I've never seen, sounds I've never heard. A tiny old man came up to me with a note in his hand. He needed help. I took his note, read it, and to this day I can remember just what I said to that man. ""That's not how you spell fellatio."""

Frasier,1wxmds,Chanz,2,Tue Feb 4 06:45:06 2014 UTC,Try reading the rest of them.
Frasier,1wp3ql,k_rock923,10,Sat Feb 1 02:14:34 2014 UTC,Don't forget she also cheated on Martin. It really seems like a case of someone dying and you forget all their faults.
Frasier,1wp3ql,bondfool,6,Sat Feb 1 08:33:38 2014 UTC,There are some plot differences. In later eps Frasier says that his dad always pushed him to by a psychiatrist and that he is dead.
Frasier,1wp3ql,purpleoceangirl,3,Sat Feb 1 03:36:22 2014 UTC,"There are definitely holes, including on Frasier (I've barely watched Cheers) like when Frasier feels inferior for Clint Webber having gone to Oxford (which Frasier also did) and many others.  I've probably watched the series more times than at least 90% of people on here, so I've caught quite a number of them."
Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,5,Sat Feb 1 04:43:27 2014 UTC,"On Frasier they cover the plot hole about the dad up when Sam comes to visit.  And as for the Clint Webber episode, do we know what Frasier did at Oxford? I think he says he is an Oxford graduate but it seems to have been a post-graduate degree. Harvard seems to be his main go-to school. In ANY case, Clint having gone to a very good school like Frasier certainly doesn't help Frasier feel superior. I don't consider this a plot hole."
Frasier,1wp3ql,DoctorSteve,5,Sat Feb 1 09:24:51 2014 UTC,"I should also add that there aren't a ton of errors. This is one of the best series of all time, imo. But the errors that do exist are more concentrated in the beginning few seasons."
Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,1 point,Sat Feb 1 10:16:46 2014 UTC,"Good point about the dad part being covered, but I didn't say that one.  When Clint says he went to Oxford, Frasier seems really frustrated. I would have thought, at that point, he would have been eager to say that he went there, as well, to not seem so inferior to him, which occurred repeatedly throughout the episode.  I'm not sure the best term is ""plot holes""...probably ""inconsistencies"" or ""minor errors"".    When spotting Niles in his hatchback, Martin says ""Well, catch up to him, Mr. 12-Cylinder German Engineering!"" Frasier is driving a BMW 540i, which actually has a V8.  When Frasier and Kate Costas argue about the key in which Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra was written/performed, they argue between 2 keys (I believe C and D-minor), but it actually changes keys throughout the entire piece and doesn't have one specific designation.  I'm trying to think of some more decent examples, but am having a tough time. I'm going to watch it now and maybe I'll catch or recall one or two more.  Don't get me wrong: I love the show. But I notice when this type of stuff happens."
Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,3,Sat Feb 1 09:44:42 2014 UTC,"When Frasier and Kate Costas argue about the key in which Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra was written/performed, they argue between 2 keys (I believe C and D-minor), but it actually changes keys throughout the entire piece and doesn't have one specific designation.   This adds extra weight to the scene. The whole point of the episode was Frasier being uncomfortable with a woman boss, and them being both right about that argument just makes it better."
Frasier,1wp3ql,sorin255,0,Mon Feb 3 20:35:24 2014 UTC,"Eh, I guess that's one way to look at it. Seems like a reach though. Frasier is supposed to be very knowledgeable in the Classical/Opera realm. They should've chosen one of the many thousands of pieces with a defined key and made one of them, preferably him, correct. I love classical music --- it's at least 98% of what I listen to -- and it bugs me when they get these things wrong. These types of things really take away from the perception that Frasier's character really knows his shit."
Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,3,Mon Feb 3 21:11:11 2014 UTC,"That's not a plot hole, it's not inconceivable that neither of them know the number of cylinders in the car. There's no way Frasier would have known - so it's possible he's made up something when telling Martin and Martin seems completely disinterested in German cars so I doubt he knows either."
Frasier,1wp3ql,HeikkiKovalainen,0,Tue Feb 4 04:49:41 2014 UTC,"This is a really good point. Considering the automotive class where Frasier and Niles ""coast"", it's likely neither of them know diddly about the cars they dive."
Frasier,1wp3ql,droopyGT,2,Tue Feb 4 07:48:26 2014 UTC,"I remember him driving a 7 series - was that later on in the show?  Thinking back, it might have been a V8 seven series anyway.  One hole that always bothered me was when how they refer to Frasier drinking Amontillado Oloroso sherry, which are just two different types."
Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,1 point,Sat Feb 1 13:02:03 2014 UTC,"Yes, the 7-series was in the latest season(s) of the show --- the last car they showed him having. Whether it was a 745 or 750, from that generation, it would've been a V8. The only V12 in that generation was a 760, which he certainly didn't have.  That's all extra info though because his previous cars were E34 and E39 540s...the 540i, each time. And that's what he was driving when Martin said that.  I really don't kniw sherries, but I can see why that'd be really bothersome."

Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,1 point,Sat Feb 1 09:33:03 2014 UTC,"He said it on multiple occasions. One I recall off the top of my head is when talking to Julia Wilcox  ""But what do I know? I'm just a Magic 8-Ball with a Harvard...and Oxford degree.""   I'm not rubbing it in --- he actually pauses and stresses those words."
Frasier,1wp3ql,Chanz,1 point,Sat Feb 1 09:52:12 2014 UTC,Weird. Sounds like you're right. Nice find.
Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,2,Sat Feb 1 10:22:20 2014 UTC,"A recurring error that always bugs me is hearing through doors, especially Frasier's condo front door, and from the kitchen. Whenever it's convenient to the plot to be heard or not heard, regardless of the volume of people speaking or yelling, that is what determines whether they hear the other people.   If some framework for deception is being laid out, the person cannot hear the speaking. But if it's a setup for a joke, like when they're talking about Lilith when they know she's outside, she hears them and replies.   Same with one time with Niles. Frasier urges everyone to not talk about something when he comes in and then Niles says through the door, ""Could you not talk about it a little more quietly?""   Of course, his normal speaking voice is perfectly audible, showing the door is not soundproof. But then there are all those instances in which people are nearly shouting in the living room about the person outside the door and the person outside somehow doesn't hear a thing.  These examples are plentiful for the front door and kitchen, which doesn't even have a door."
Frasier,1wp3ql,madfunk,2,Sat Feb 1 10:40:35 2014 UTC,"Sitcoms, especially when done in front of an audience, are basically comedic stage plays. Frasier is a very theatrical show, and I find if you accept that this is basically ""stage whispering"" in cases where they can't be heard, it's less of an issue."
Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,0,Sun Feb 2 17:47:28 2014 UTC,"This is true. Good point. It's actually one of the reasons I really like it - how theatrical it is. However, for the record, I believe I have only ever seen one play."
Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,1 point,Sun Feb 2 22:38:54 2014 UTC,"Came across another error, if you're interested.  In S10E09, when Frasier is shown praying to God to spare Niles during his heart surgery, he expresses gratitude, but says he still never saw the inside of The Empire Club. That isn't true. Both he and Niles went, Frasier with Daphney, and ended up trying to sabotage one another when they learned there was only one vacancy. Frasier was accepted and returned to try to give his membership to Niles, only to learn that Nile was supposed to have gotten it all along.   The whole episode revolved around the club, and Frasier was inside at least twice, yet he said in this prayer that he never saw the inside."

Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,1 point,Wed Feb 12 11:20:07 2014 UTC,"Here's another inconsistency:  In season 11, Frasier gives Charlotte $10,000 for the match-making service. When Frasier finds out she only has 5 clients, all of whom he has dated, he demands his money back. Breaking down upset, Charlotte admits she spent it on rent, food, etc and can't pay him back. She also goes on to say that she had to move in with her mother.  Very soon after, she takes a trip back to Chicago, where she had her original and highly successful matchmaking business, and then returns. She tells Frank (and later, Frasier) that she ran into her ex in Chicago and bought the business back from him.  This was just weeks after Frasier and Charlotte met. How the hell could she afford to purchase what she called the most successful matchmaking business in Chicago? Nonsense."
Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,1 point,Thu Feb 13 19:32:39 2014 UTC,"Thanks. I've watched every episode so many times, I really should start at the beginning and write down all the little errors I find.   About the Oxford thing, Niles went to Yale and Cambridge. Although he speaks of his universities less often than Frasier, most times they each cite just one at a time as though it was the only one they went to.  I definitely find that to be strange."
Frasier,1wp3ql,droopyGT,2,Sat Feb 1 10:28:53 2014 UTC,"Do you have a source on Niles going to Princeton? Yale I sure about, but Niles also says he went to Cambridge. I thought it was good symmetry that each brother went to one Ivy and one English university, but that they were different."
Frasier,1wp3ql,K3R3G3,1 point,Fri Feb 14 16:17:50 2014 UTC,I made a mistake! I don't know why I wrote that - Cambridge is correct. And I agree on the appreciation of American/English university symmetry. I always liked that touch and how it makes sense with the show and their characters.

Frasier,1wp3ql,amrith777,3,Sat Feb 1 02:43:24 2014 UTC,"Things I have noticed so far...  Niles says in one episode he has a super-tight pre-up with Maris. Later on, there is no pre-nup and everything is up for negotiation.  Martin does not talk in a stilted fashion when he endorses a political candidate for TV (in one take), but later when he appears on the antiques roadshow he talks one word at a time.  Martin calls out Bulldog by yelling that he has a gun, as an ex-cop he would never cause panic like that to prove a point, it was out of character."

Frasier,1w96fx,Chanz,2,Tue Jan 28 04:48:53 2014 UTC,Is it ever shown that he has paid for the wedding? I thought he got out of it by getting too involved against her wishes?
Frasier,1w96fx,droopyGT,2,Tue Feb 4 09:55:17 2014 UTC,"I don't remember them ever specifically saying he got out of it. Daphne did blow up at Frasier for meddling in the wedding plans, but Frasier was actually meddling so much because he was paying for it and wanted it to be great, and not as a plan to get out of paying for the wedding."

Frasier,1w96fx,Kalimyre,8,Mon Jan 27 14:52:47 2014 UTC,"Lilith cheated on him, why should he have to pay alimony?  Child support, I can see, but she's a full time psychiatrist and he has a radio show so she might make more than him."
Frasier,1w96fx,andreirublev,4,Mon Jan 27 12:17:11 2014 UTC,One would assume he's been fussy about his money since he was old enough to balance his checkbook. Thus he invested his cash properly early on and coasts on his investments. Like the series of episodes where he loses his job and literally gives zero thought to looking for another one.
Frasier,1w96fx,itsnotatoomer,5,Tue Jan 28 05:12:13 2014 UTC,"What does everyone suppose a semi-popular, non-sports talk radio host would make in a large city (in the 90s)?  I'm thinking $300,000 or so?  A 3000 sqft condo with a great view in pre-real-estate-bubble Seattle probably went for like $2 million.  BMW 750li was $100,000.  Bespoke clothing $1000-$2000 per garment.  A typical Frasier + Niles dinner including wine ranging from $200 - $500 unless they got an especially notable bottle.  First class flights transcon to Boston $2000-3000 each trip, business/first to remote island vacations and whatnot $5000-7000 each trip.  There were probably nontrivial expenses to be involved in being a proper patron of the arts (you don't get on the opera board by not giving them money).  He was probably living somewhat above his means, but not egregiously so.  Especially if he, as someone else mentioned, he had been investing his psychiatry money all long before buying the condo."

It works great with classic games and software which is it's main purpose.  It is also connected to my internet connection but I wouldn't recommend using it online.  Its more impressive it can load webpages than actually using it online.  Its a durable machine.

The brothers decide to throw a dinner party, and the episode explores their attempt at agreeing on what four couples to invite, how they should invite them, and finally their analytical nature and tendencies as they attempt to analyze what their society friends think of their close relationship as brothers when one of their guests displays lukewarm enthusiasm to the invite. A great episode to watch, and in the eleven seasons, my personal favorite. Top shelf writing. Set aside some time to view this episode, maybe twice to fully enjoy the spot on comedy. You will enjoy!"

It's the times you never even tried, when you           just lost your nerve.""  It's really no different than Carpe Diem, at the heart of it.

When Frasier meets Niles at his office and they begin to go back through some of my favorite Niles-Daphne moments, Frasier makes one of the most astute points ever: Niles has a serious psychological problem. The backbone of this show is that Frasier will offer advice on his show that actually ends up helping him through a crisis. One of the more subtle points is really minor psychological issues that the characters ignore. And this one is huge. This is 8 seasons of us enjoying Niles' quirky and lovable infatuation with Daphne, then come to realize this show was pulling the long con this whole time. That without the laugh track, Niles had a serious problem for which he needed therapy.  I can go on and on about this episode. Its fantastic.  BAD, BAD COOK"

Martin tells him that Fredrick's a kid you should get him one of those Robo Geek's instead. Frasier is all I know my son crap he won't like that.  There is a background storyline about how both Frasier and Martin have a hard time buying gifts for each other. When the mail order does come its the wrong package. Frasier runs to the mall to get something geeky for Fredrick again.  When Fredicks comes home he tells Frasier that hes been a good boy so Santa will get him what he wants which is a RoboGeek. Frasier is hugely disappointed since his son is home for Christmas and he doesn't have the gift his son wants.  Martin is all you might as well open your gift now .

However, I think it also stands to reason that if Frasier said ""It's a mixture of Cabernet and Merlot,"" he would have won.  The fact that he didn't say this suggests he didn't detect the Merlot.  So, while you could say Frasier detected the more subtle 45% of the wine, he conversely MISSED the 55%.  This is worse than Niles MISSING 45%. That's how I explain it, anyway."

I see where you would commend Frasier for having guessed the subtler wine, the majority of the blend was Merlot so the point went to Niles. Since Merlot was the primary wine of the blend, the answer they were looking for was Merlot.  I never thought too hard about the scenario, which is also, I think, the reason that many people misunderstand certain jokes, by over-thinking them."
Frasier,1s1dh3,JClarenceThornton,3,Wed Dec 4 07:44:12 2013 UTC,"Now I'm not very familiar with wine tasting, but could it not be that the cabernet would have a slightly stronger taste, therefore by blending less of it into the mixture it would still have an even taste?"

Frasier,1puz5i,Stuck_in_TN,2,Fri Dec 20 12:45:12 2013 UTC,I watched it quicker this last time through and got really involved with the characters.  Series finale nearly killed me.
Frasier,1puz5i,Drusss,1 point,Mon Nov 4 08:07:21 2013 UTC,"My wife and I still love to watch the show today. If it's on reruns, we watch. It comes on late night where we live but she usually goes to bed earlier than I and never catches it so I bought her several of the seasons on DVD. She will usually pop in a disc and fall asleep to Frasier."
Frasier,1puz5i,Stuck_in_TN,1 point,Mon Nov 4 15:28:23 2013 UTC,How good is the EXTRA content in the DVD's? Like interviews Bonus scenes etc. I was thinking of buying the whole series but then I thought its on netflix so why bother. If they have a lot of other content on it then I will definitely buy it.
Frasier,1puz5i,Drusss,1 point,Fri Dec 20 12:46:41 2013 UTC,"There's really not much, if any. The first season has a ""making of"" and a tour of the apartment. I don't think any of the other seasons we own have any extras, which is disappointing."
Frasier,1puz5i,Stuck_in_TN,1 point,Fri Dec 20 13:50:32 2013 UTC,So disappointing that. I saw a couple of interviews on youtube with the whole cast and I was surprised how ... ummm serious all of them were? I'm sure they like each other but they lacked that warmth people should have after working for 11 years. Did you notice that too?
Frasier,1puz5i,TheOnlyBoBo,1 point,Fri Dec 20 13:54:33 2013 UTC,I have noticed that.  I expected them to be more loose.

Frasier,1pqgir,i_have_reddit,9,Sat Nov 2 04:32:09 2013 UTC,"Lifelong Seattle resident here, there are places still similar to that lifestyle today but of course less caricatured. I believe he says in an episode ""i live in the elliott bay towers by the counter balance"" which would be describing parts of belltown along the waterfront, which has a mix of upscale condominiums and a large amount of homeless people. There are a lot of independent coffee shops a la cafe nervosa. Niles lives on Roosevelt if i remember hearing that correctly which would put him in north Seattle near the university district. The view from Frasier's apartment i have read was mainly based off the view from kerry park on queen anne hill. The main thing from the show absent from present day are Martin's beloved supersonics."
Frasier,1pqgir,bobbriscoe,3,Sat Nov 2 05:21:31 2013 UTC,Yea...as an Oklahoman...sorry about that.

Martin gets excited when he hears they are going to a football game until Frasier spoils his elation."

Frasier,1nq6gb,Beanchilla,17,Fri Oct 4 15:07:03 2013 UTC,I don't like the episode where they meet their Greek extended family. I felt that all those characters were very annoying and the whole storyline was silly.
Frasier,1nq6gb,Big_Yellow_Joint,5,Fri Oct 4 21:03:29 2013 UTC,I just watched that one the other day.  The mother was a total caricature.  I did love Marty's interaction with that old cousin of his haha
Frasier,1nq6gb,socrates_scrotum,3,Sat Oct 5 01:42:39 2013 UTC,I've said this before. That one felt like a pilot for a spin-off.
Frasier,1nq6gb,IATEEMMA,3,Sat Oct 5 03:24:35 2013 UTC,NOPE NOPE!  Inappropriate.
Frasier,1nq6gb,Frasier_Fan,5,Tue Dec 3 00:47:34 2013 UTC,I didnt care for the ones where the Cheers people returned. Especially the one with Diane.
Frasier,1nq6gb,Berkilak,2,Sat Oct 5 03:48:05 2013 UTC,I agree. It felt like they were just going through the motions in those episodes. And they weren't really that funny.
Frasier,1nq6gb,Big_Yellow_Joint,2,Sat Oct 5 05:43:19 2013 UTC,"I liked the Diane one when she put on the ""Cheers"" play. It was sort of sad/funny that she was dating the actor playing the Sam character. Sort of a bittersweet episode that she realizes how much she hurt Fraiser/she still cares about him. I don't really care for the Woody one or the one where they go back to Boston for Cliff's retirement. The Sam one was ok."
Frasier,1nq6gb,theworldbystorm,4,Mon Oct 7 17:35:05 2013 UTC,"Roz and the Schnoz was definitely a weaker episode. It's hard for me to think of a least favorite episode off the top of my head, though."
Frasier,1nq6gb,bobbriscoe,3,Fri Oct 4 18:39:21 2013 UTC,Yeah! I thought it was odd because the theme of the show is actually very sentimental. Roz worrying about her baby inheriting her worst traits and having to live a difficult life.   It ended up just being built around the nose jokes though! Bah!  I can't think of many others that are weaker though. I wasn't a huge fan of the episode where Marty writes a sinatra song but it has such a good ending that I can't help but like it haha.
Frasier,1nq6gb,sappy16,2,Fri Oct 4 18:48:36 2013 UTC,I completely agree. it's another episode where the theme seemed right for the show but the actual delivery wasn't that great.

Frasier,1nq6gb,Twiggy3,11,Thu Oct 24 16:18:31 2013 UTC,The best part about her was Niles's goofy reaction every time he ran into her
Frasier,1nq6gb,Twiggy3,2,Sat Oct 5 05:53:28 2013 UTC,The ones where Daphne was fat
Frasier,1nq6gb,NicTulp,7,Sat Oct 5 06:01:52 2013 UTC,I actually thought that episode was very powerful. That scene where Frasier visits Niles at his office to talks some sense into him when Niles doesn't realize Daphne gained weight.

Frasier,1ni9fn,TrueGrey,3,Wed Oct 2 00:46:52 2013 UTC,I literally just made my household play with this tongue twister for ten minutes last week when this episode came on my rewatch queue.  What a crazy random happenstance.
Frasier,1ni9fn,djrjr,2,Tue Oct 1 18:58:12 2013 UTC,I've often wondered if this was a blooper with him saying Flasier and they just ran with it...  One of the best shows ever!

Frasier,1nfyv0,OPR8R,5,Tue Oct 1 04:06:24 2013 UTC,"From the episode called 'Dinner Party', watch the full scene here for more context.  Basically Frasier is trying to get Martin to change his plans, and is calling his bluff that they could both do something at the same time, by suggesting the most artsy-fartsy, fancy, elitist thing which he knows his dad can't stand. And it works!  The joke is Agamemnon at Jacob's Pillow is the craziest and fanciest sounding thing ever, I don't even know what it is, just the way Frasier delivers the line is classic! He is manipulating his father with his sense of knowledge about just what will put his dad off."

How           much easier it’d be if we just could go straight over the           trees, over a building.  That’s what a giant would do.  They           should let everybody be a giant for a day."

Frasier,1jrb6j,xx-Felix-xx,15,Sat Aug 17 06:57:04 2013 UTC,"God, there are way too many.  If I'm watching it with other die hard fans, we usually point out every inaccuracy.  Off the top of my head:   Martin's extended family either existing or not, Walt or the ""mess of cousins"", which could be Hester's, but still. Eddie's, Frasier's and probably a few others birthdays On birthdays, on Martin's birthday, they ""go through the same nonsense every year"", despite Niles getting him a tux the year before (with very little one upping between him and Frasier) and the year before that they forget entirely. Daphne ""never had any serious boyfriends"", despite being engaged to Clive and the numerous lovers she mentioned to her mother on a later series. Frasier's knowledge of languages comes and goes, occasionally knowing Spanish, French, German etc but not knowing them at all when the plot calls for it. Martin's meeting Hester, being on shore leave, serving in Korea and Frasier being born don't quite add up, I can't remember the exact details at the moment, but I could look into it if anyone cares. Frasier from Cheers and Frasier on Frasier being different, Martin and Niles existing as well as various personality traits of Frasier himself and Hester etc. Crock Tales creates a number of plot holes to do with first meetings and current states of relationships etc (I think one clashes with Roger existing). Frasier not having a date since Christmas, despite going out with Kate Costas a few episodes ago (not during Christmas).   I'll add more when I think of them.   Placing when Maris and Niles were married and when Frasier and Lilith were changes.  Niles and Maris got divorced after 15 years (Series 5) of marriage and Lilith in series in 1 mentions being at the wedding, which would have been 1982, before Frasier met Lilith. Frasier is allergic to cats, but looks after Mr. Bottomsley and Niles is allergic to Spackle, but then later he doesn't know what it is! Niles mentions ""like drag queen at a tractor pull"" earlier, then in a later episode questions what a tractor pull is (while talking to Daphne). Frasier says, ""Rozalinda, a word"", in the episode ""sleeping with the enemy"" before the nickname is coined later in ""last time I saw Maris"". In ""Space Quest"" he dislikes fried breakfasts (Martin cooks it) but in ""Guess Who's Coming to Breakfast"" he likes that ""Heavenly Aroma"" of Daphne's fried breakfast. In ""Death becomes him"" Daphne mentions to Martin that patients have died on her before, yet in ""Roz Krantz and Goldenstein are dead"" Martin is shocked to find out that patients have died on her. Frasier for the sake of one episode has a problem with hugging, but doesn't before and after. Daphne's mother in one episode jokes about Daphne being pregnant, then later insists on her being a virgin. On ""Three Faces of Frasier"" Roz begs Frasier to go on a date for Daphne's wedding, then in ""Something Borrowed and Something Blue"" she snubs Frasier offer. Daphne's dad was at the wedding to Donny, which would mean that Niles would have met him before going to Manchester. In ""An Affair to Forget"", Niles is somehow able to hear Frasier despite the fact he's in a sensory deprivation tank. In ""Dukes we hardly knew yee"", Frasier and Niles meet Duke for the first time, despite in a later episode Frasier dates Duke's daughter, the one they used to call ""the ugly dukeling"" as children. Maris was both force fed and always fat as a child, ""To Thine old self be true"" and ""Burying a Grudge"", ""Always chubby as a child"" and ""usual childhood things...force feeding"". For the sake of ""Chess Pains"" Martin claims to never play chess, yet in an earlier episode he's playing chess, with a corn nut. Freddie's age either stays still across multiple seasons or accelerates across very few.  In season 8 and 10 he's 13 years old. When Martin gets a date with Mrs. Crowley, Daphne mentions ""how to get a date in two easy years"", where in fact a few episodes ago he was still dating Sherry."

Frasier,1jrb6j,Berkilak,11,Tue Aug 6 15:35:02 2013 UTC,"I thought the joke is that because of her lisp he wasn't sure if she had a problem with her ""monsieur"" or her ""masseur."""

Frasier,1jrb6j,TrueGrey,6,Sat Aug 17 04:57:34 2013 UTC,"Plot Hole Fixer Attempt #12-??  My greatest challenge yet ... okay here goes nothing.  Ladies and gentlemen and Frasierian afficionados, get your shovels ready!   Several of the bullets were redundant with other (likely subsequent) posts by others on this thread, which I have already made my (however clumsy) attempts to parry, individually.    On birthdays, on Martin's birthday, they ""go through the same nonsense every year"", despite Niles getting him a tux the year before (with very little one upping between him and Frasier) and the year before that they forget entirely.    There have been many years that may have met the pattern better, and the one upsmanship may have led to the tux off screen. Additionally, Martin could be remembering childhood primariliy and their youthful fighting for parental approval, which they were prone to.    Martin's meeting Hester, being on shore leave, serving in Korea and Frasier being born don't quite add up, I can't remember the exact details at the moment, but I could look into it if anyone cares.    I'm certainly curious what you mean on this one, as I've taken the personal challenge of patching each possible plothole with downright machiavellian rationalization.    Frasier from Cheers and Frasier on Frasier being different, Martin and Niles existing as well as various personality traits of Frasier himself and Hester etc.    People change over time, with major events in their life, and even with their surroundings.  Coincidentally, I myself was a very different person in my brief tenure taking residence in Seattle.  See the How I Met Your Mother episode on ""revertigo.""  Not to mention Frasier's not-too-infrequent remarks about his own personal changes and the influence of Niles etc. Martin's premature death announcement was attributed to a figure of speech, wrought from anger, distance, and/or uncaring.    Frasier not having a date since Christmas, despite going out with Kate Costas a few episodes ago (not during Christmas).    Well, it was a secret at first, and when the word DID get out, it was more hookups than actual dates.    Placing when Maris and Niles were married and when Frasier and Lilith were changes. Niles and Maris got divorced after 15 years (Series 5) of marriage and Lilith in series in 1 mentions being at the wedding, which would have been 1982, before Frasier met Lilith.    I have a few theories on this one, somewhat less reputable than my other posts:  1) Lilith knew someone else at the wedding and attended not as his date, 2) Lilith misspoke, 3) At no point in the show did they specifically write off the existance of The Doctor OR the Tardis.    Frasier is allergic to cats, but looks after Mr. Bottomsley and Niles is allergic to Spackle, but then later he doesn't know what it is!    People with cat allergies can stand them from time to time and can take pills/shots offscreen. Someone was mistaken about his spackle allergy and/or just simply told Niles that he was allergic to it without further explanation of what it actually was.  I'm allergic to ""Balsam of Peru"" according to my dermatologist, but I haven't the faintest Idea what it is, aside from the fact that it's neither the stone balsam or the wood balsa from the region of Peru.    Niles mentions ""like drag queen at a tractor pull"" earlier, then in a later episode questions what a tractor pull is (while talking to Daphne).    Niles appropriated a redneck event/expression without knowing what it was and/or he had just heard about it that day (people's seemingly random improvisations are most frequently mere mimics of thigns heard in passing that day) and didn't remember years later.    Frasier says, ""Rozalinda, a word"", in the episode ""sleeping with the enemy"" before the nickname is coined later in ""last time I saw Maris"".    Is Rozalinda really a nickname that need be coined?  Seems a straightforward affectation. Perhaps Noel got the idea for the character name from the nickname and not the other way around.    In ""Space Quest"" he dislikes fried breakfasts (Martin cooks it) but in ""Guess Who's Coming to Breakfast"" he likes that ""Heavenly Aroma"" of Daphne's fried breakfast.    Smells =/= taste? Or perhaps fried Breakfast is the one thing Daphne can cook well?    In ""Death becomes him"" Daphne mentions to Martin that patients have died on her before, yet in ""Roz Krantz and Goldenstein are dead"" Martin is shocked to find out that patients have died on her.    Martin's a drama queen and/or wasn't listening the first time.  Old people forget things?    Frasier for the sake of one episode has a problem with hugging, buesn't before and after.    Insert generic Frasierian explanation for why current events could have manifested themselves in a particular hug-aversion, which would have faded upon the stimulus' resolution.    Daphne's mother in one episode jokes about Daphne being pregnant, then later insists on her being a virgin.    She was just playing along with the drunken joke about the pregnancy, not taking it seriously since her daughter is obviously a virgin.  She DID offer her an alcoholic drink immediately thereafter.  Alternatively, the pregnancy could have burst her virgin bubble, but it reformed when she discovered the rumors to be false in the end.    On ""Three Faces of Frasier"" Roz begs Frasier to go on a date for Daphne's wedding, then in ""Something Borrowed and Something Blue"" she snubs Frasier offer.    The situation had changed, what with the seating chart placing next to her ex-boyfriend for whom she wanted to put on an envy-inducing show, a task not easily accomplished by escorting one's boss.    Daphne's dad was at the wedding to Donny, which would mean that Niles would have met him before going to Manchester.    They didn't meet on screen, and they likely didn't have time to meet off screen.    In ""An Affair to Forget"", Niles is somehow able to hear Frasier despite the fact he's in a sensory deprivation tank.    It's not completely sound-proof.  After all, that would be quite the safety hazard.  Plus Frasier is really quite loud.    In ""Dukes we hardly knew yee"", Frasier and Niles meet Duke for the first time, despite in a later episode Frasier dates Duke's daughter, the one they used to call ""the ugly dukeling"" as children.    Frasier and Niles didn't really know Duke as a kid, because perhaps he missed the trips or simply stayed inside or on the lake with Martin.  Maybe they met in passing as children, but not enough to make any real impression, so they had to re-meet him as adults.    Maris was both force fed and always fat as a child, ""To Thine old self be true"" and ""Burying a Grudge"", ""Always chubby as a child"" and ""usual childhood things...force feeding"".    The force feeding took place after she lost weight after the fat days.  The reason she had to be force fed was her inhuman aversion to food due to the desperation of never gaining weight again, a trait which served her all the way through season 7.  Alternatively, it could have happened PRE weight gain.   Finally, she could have gained weight due to a hormonal or glandular issue (since, resolved) but refused to eat anything at all, for fear of maintaining or even gaining more weight.    For the sake of ""Chess Pains"" Martin claims to never play chess, yet in an earlier episode he's playing chess, with a corn nut.    He never plays, but he's played before.  He asks frasier to remind him, not to teach him, IIRC.  Alternatively, Martin is sufficiently savvy and cagey to have trolled/sharked Frasier.    Freddie's age either stays still across multiple seasons or accelerates across very few. In season 8 and 10 he's 13 years old.    Freddie was conceived in the Tardis, and as such, energy from the time vortex causes him to behave oddly, temporally speaking.  He's neither completely human nor time lord, but we can't begin to comprehend the mysteries of the universe.  Alternatively, Frasier's just bad at keeping track of his age, since he never sees him and can tend to be self involved.   Aaaaand we're clear!  Please pardon my loquacity and the brobdingnagian scale of my rhetorical challenge to myself."

In less than half a second, he learns that her name is Maureen, where she hangs out after work, and that she is probably there right then.  In another episode we learnt that Martin met Hester at a crime scene. ""They hadn't moved the body yet."" In another episode Niles says that Mr. Wojydubikowski introduced Hester to Martin."

Even if he wasn't a cop, he could have known Hester and when Martin, having left the crime scene without learning her name, was in the same situation as Frasier, above, Mr. Wojydubikowski connected them with but a minor pluck of cupid's bow."

FRASIER: Quite right.  NILES: To impossible standards.   We learn in S07E17, ""Whine Club,"" that if it wasn't for Mr. W. (Stan), Martin wouldn't have made it through the academy. He also lent Martin the money for his first car and named a son Martin.  Martin's version of the story was revealed in S02E08, ""Adventures in Paradise, Part 1.""   MARTIN: It's like when I met your mother—it was at a crime scene. Hester was a psychiatrist, so every now and again the department would have her run up a profile of a suspect.  I remember the first time I met her. It was over the chalk outline of a murder victim. One look at her hair silhouetted against that flashing blue light of the coroner's wagon, and I was a gone-r. She drew a little smile on the head of the outline, and I drew a pair of eyes, and before you knew it we were laughing like a couple of kids.  FRASIER: Dad, you're a ghoul.  MARTIN: I was joking. We couldn't draw on the outline, they hadn't moved the body yet.   So, yes, we could fill in the hole with supposition, or we could leave it unfilled and explain the hole's presence by the 5-season passage of time and the resultant complete changing of the guard (the show's writers)."

I suppose he could be playing dumb to follow Daphne around but it genuinely seems like he has no idea what he is doing.  However, many times later over the course of the series, it is shown that Niles (& Frasier) are quite the gourmands who both know how to cook very well. Hell, they went to ""sauce camp"" as children for God's sake! I know it was probably just an in-continuity to make a funny scene, but it has always bugged me for some reason."

And, I'll be honest, even at the tender age of 10 (seriously, why did my dad let me watch that show at a young age) I remember thinking, ""There's no way Frasier is going to be good."" How wrong I was!!!  Cheers was an amazing show. Frasier was not featured heavily although he became more central (but not totally central) towards the end. I loved him on Cheers though. Cheers is one of the most well written sitcoms on television in my mind. But you need to watch it (if you do) without the expectation of it being like Frasier. It IS a different show and it's not about Frasier. However, it's so well written, it's so complex (although you don't realize it while watching immediately) and it's such an inspiration for a LOT of writers even to this day. I highly recommend it. Just go in with an open mind.  Also, I use too many parenthesis. :)"

These are all great sitcoms, and while they can be ranked by personal preference, you're not really going to be steered wrong going into any of them.  That said, Cheers and Seinfeld both took a little while to find their feet.  The first seasons of both these shows were different from the later seasons when they really hit their stride.  (Frasier, having the benefit of a well-established main character from another series, was a much better example of a show that hit the ground running.)"

It is a comic song sung by the Major General who, like most politicians in Gilbert and Sullivan shows, has a great deal of theoretical learning (the lyrics say: ""I know the kings of England and all the fights historical, from Marathon to Waterloo in order categorical) but no practical military experience.  This is not the only time Gilbert and Sullivan are referenced in regards to Frasier. ""Bulldog"" Briscoe once makes a bet that he can get Frasier to sing on air. To this end, he pretends to be an acquaintance of Niles and calls Frasier, asking him to help settle a bet by recalling the words to ""Three Little Maids"", a song from Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta The Mikado.

He was a detective and maybe he does some odd things to put the others on edge - regardless of who ends up looking like a fool. We only catch glimpses of what is otherwise 11 seasons of ups and downs.   2) Though the can is steel, it is more likely that the plastic cap busted off relieving all the pressure. The only caveat with this at all is that in order for shaving cream to dispense and puff up at all, it needs that nozel to adequately mix with the air. Otherwise it is a just sort of a slurry - as seen on mythbusters. However, even if it did explode, there physically isn't enough pressure to turn it into a real grenade. It would likely open like that if you explode soda cans. Grenades are designed for shrapnel - shaving cans are not.   3) UL?"

Frasier,1ihopd,DoctorSteve,6,Thu Jul 18 01:42:10 2013 UTC,"Also in the same vein, where did Frederick sleep while he was at the apartment?  He would run off down the hall, but I don't remember him having a bedroom there."
Frasier,1ihopd,SickTriceratops,3,Wed Jul 17 20:03:38 2013 UTC,"Good point.  Actually, when Freddy is trying to manipulate his parents to get a minibike, he's in a bedroom playing a videogame.  I don't think its Frasier's room.  It appears to be an unused bedroom where Freddy sleeps when he's there.    So it seems the show goofed by pretending there was no extra bedroom for Niles, when there was the other room for Freddy."
Frasier,1ihopd,DoctorSteve,3,Wed Jul 17 21:30:49 2013 UTC,It's possible Freddy would borrow his dad's room. We should compare the layout of that room in the Thanksgiving episode to the episode where the dad gets his security job and no one wants to walk Eddie.  :P
Frasier,1ihopd,kewriosity,10,Wed Jul 17 22:23:22 2013 UTC,"I think once a character has disappeared down that hallway, it's safe to assume they're no longer inhabiting the same physical plane as the rest of the apartment."
Frasier,1ihopd,Kyle-Overstreet,5,Thu Jul 18 01:16:53 2013 UTC,"Well in a sense, Frasier is a play, so every section of the apartment can be independent from the rest. Like how the very local and open-space kitchen is where they go to talk about people in the living room.  Or how no one in the corner bathroom can hear anything going on in the living room.  And that's why I love Frasier. I love plays."
Frasier,1ihopd,JohnQuigley,2,Thu Jul 18 01:18:02 2013 UTC,"Wow, that's a fantastic theory and it makes a lot of sense in both the style and context surrounding the show. I loved Frasier and I always found it mildly amusing when they'd run off into the kitchen for a secret conversation when there are people less than 10 feet away at the table  Makes me think of the trope where Frasier's front door is basically a sound proof barrier for the first couple of seasons (they will talk and yell literally right next to it). I think they finally played this off when someone waiting at the door goes ""I can hear you"""
Frasier,1ihopd,trazz3561,4,Sun Jul 21 08:18:08 2013 UTC,"And where did Freddy sleep?  EDIT: Someone pointed that out already, but seriously: I genuinely believed that Frasier had at least 4 bedrooms because he would know how important it was to give Freddy his own space."
Frasier,1ihopd,DoctorSteve,3,Wed Jul 17 20:34:24 2013 UTC,"I believe Freddy sleeps in Marty's room, I'm sure it's mentioned in one of the episodes. I always just assumed Ferguson lived off the premises like Frasier originally wanted Daphne to do. As for there being 3 doors in the hallway I always thought that was supposed to be the infamous hat museum with the outlets for the washer and dryer"
Frasier,1ihopd,sqrlsjustwannahvefun,5,Tue Jul 23 06:42:40 2013 UTC,This article might help. I believe it was posted here before.
Frasier,1ihopd,DoctorSteve,2,Thu Jul 18 00:58:09 2013 UTC,"Hadn't Daphne moved out at that point when Ferguson lived there?  And what proof do you have that Ferguson lived there? I believe at the end of the episode he simply departs, so he couldn't have had any belonging in the house."
Frasier,1ihopd,HappyTheBunny,6,Wed Jul 17 16:40:50 2013 UTC,"No, Daphne still lived there.  Interesting, I hadn't considered that Ferguson aka Lord Weirdo might live off the premises.  He'd have to get there early to wake up Frasier, but its certainly possible."

Frasier,1go7ol,ChainsawSam,3,Thu Jun 20 03:37:46 2013 UTC,"Frasier wasn't filmed in Seattle, so no.  It's all fiction unfortunately.  There is a cafe which is apparently the inspiration for Cafe Nervosa but I've never bothered with it.  There was a La Cigar Volant... in Santa Cruz, CA and it was named long after the show was on as a sort of joke.  It is now closed.  In fact, there isn't even a building which is even capable of having Frasier's iconic view.  Bummed out yet?  Don't be.  Seattle is still a pretty damned awesome place.  It is the cleanest big city I've ever seen and comparatively has only moderately terrible traffic (paradise compared to LA, Chicago, and New York!).  Pike's Place, the Space Needle, City Center, and the Marina are interesting enough tourist traps and there is enough good cuisine and local beers to keep you occupied for quite a long time.  You cannot do a ""Frasier Date Night,"" but Seattle is definitely worth seeing.  Oh but we do have an Opera house and it is pretty solid.  Could still hit up the Opera House and then visit one of many extremely fine dining options.  I'd definitely recommend giving Seattle a visit.  Edit:  Go ahead and do the fancy stuff, but I'd also definitely recommend a night hitting up Owl n' Thistle, an Irish pub roundabout Pioneer Square.  They've got an amazing irish stew and a pretty good atmosphere.  Couple glasses of good thick stout along with the stew, served with a really hearty bread, is a great way to spend the night."

Frasier,1glimj,darktask,18,Tue Jun 18 17:47:54 2013 UTC,I'd have had Bulldog in the final episode and given him his job back. Seemed unfair to his character to lose his job in the first place. Especially having won those Seabees and being a huge ratings guy in beginning.

Frasier,1glimj,Planet-man,7,Tue Jun 18 23:04:38 2013 UTC,"Oh yes! I liked the Cora plotline, especially what it did to Frasier's blood pressure. And Cora was lovely, Ronnie was a little too saloon singin' for me."
Frasier,1glimj,daffodilhill,4,Wed Jun 19 00:40:45 2013 UTC,"I think the problem with Martin marrying Cora is that Cora is very similar to Hester, i.e. an educated, cultured professional with a lot of letters after her name.  A theme on the show is that the men find happiness with women who are totally different than their former wives."
Frasier,1glimj,DraperWhite,2,Wed Jun 19 18:47:00 2013 UTC,"That would have been cool, since I don't think there were many interracial couples on TV back then."
Frasier,1glimj,daffodilhill,8,Wed Jun 19 01:02:09 2013 UTC,Roz is woefully underused. Sure she got the whole pregnant story line... but for the most part she was just used when they wanted to make a joke about her slutiness.
Frasier,1glimj,Beanchilla,-2,Tue Jun 18 22:23:16 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I learned about slut shaming a few years ago and now it's hard to watch reruns where they shame her for it. :("

Frasier,1glimj,daffodilhill,6,Fri Jun 21 15:04:30 2013 UTC,"The entire time I was watching the show all I could do was hope that any given situation would work out in his favor and he would not make a fool out of himself, and each and every time, eventually, ended with him doing the latter. However, looking back, I would not change a thing.  Outside of his character though, I would change the number of seasons from 11 to 22.   What a great show it was. While I enjoy other shows like Arrested Development and the like, there really is no other show like Frasier."

Frasier,1glimj,Kilbo1,2,Sun Sep 15 17:53:53 2013 UTC,Frasier should have stayed on the morning tv show.
Frasier,1glimj,DoctorSteve,2,Wed Jun 19 02:13:45 2013 UTC,"I'd want to give Frasier a little more often successful with his endeavors. He's a tragic character and in most episodes, rarely finds real, lasting happiness or success. This is why we love him but too often do I find myself sad for him. I would have liked to see at least one or two more happy relationships that weren't screwed up by his character flaws for a change."
Frasier,1glimj,Beanchilla,2,Wed Jun 19 14:52:15 2013 UTC,"I'd want to see more Mel. I really enjoyed her character and I felt like more of her and Niles would have been nice. Their dynamic was awesome to watch.  I'd want Frasier to have a couple of ongoing relationships. I feel like he fails too often. It'd be nice to see some blunders pay off for more than just two episodes.  I'd like to have gotten rid of the singing episodes. In fact, most of the Martin heavy episodes were always weak to me. I prefer him on the side. He's a great character but I think he's better at just having one liners.  I'd like Bulldog and Roz to be together.   I like having Niles end up with Daphne but I would have held off for another season or so.  Also, I would find a way to bring Donnie back periodically. I love that guy."
Frasier,1glimj,Beanchilla,2,Fri Jun 21 15:05:44 2013 UTC,I'd remove that plastic surgeon arc (Mel?).  It was obvious that she would become a bitch and she was only a plot device to move along Niles and Daphne.  Frasier was a better show than that story arc.
Frasier,1glimj,DoctorSteve,4,Tue Jun 18 18:52:52 2013 UTC,"Mel was the half-sane Maris, she represented progress. Besides, they had to give Niles something to do while Daphne dated Donnie."
Frasier,1glimj,Beanchilla,3,Wed Jun 19 01:01:06 2013 UTC,I thought Mel was good for Niles. The angle was a tad rushed but he seemed very happy with her. Niles and Daphne both come off as villains in that storyline.
Frasier,1glimj,hercules-rockefeller,3,Tue Jun 18 21:08:22 2013 UTC,Mel supported Niles more than anyone else I think. She tried to make him feel powerful and take what he wanted.  She was sadistic but I really liked her. I always remember how sweetly she spoke of Niles when Daphne was giving her that massage in one episode. I think we could have used more of her to be honest.
Frasier,1glimj,Kyle-Overstreet,3,Fri Jun 21 15:07:09 2013 UTC,"I was always waiting for the episode in which they find out that Mel is secretly Martin's age, as is hinted at when Niles first meets her and sees a picture of her adult son, but they never do."

Frasier,1glimj,Pippen1984,2,Wed Aug 14 21:21:31 2013 UTC,I like that Christmas episode with both her and Donny mixed into the Crane family. They were nice additions. Whenever someone stays over at the Crane household (not in secret) they fit in well.

Frasier,1gb59n,WhiskeyPope,3,Fri Jun 14 02:45:40 2013 UTC,"I think Dr. Phil's episode was pretty cool because of how forced it was. Really made me think of it as live theater. Kelsey Grammar also only rehearsed for each episode, once and alone, to heighten the drama of the show. This made being a guest star especially nerve-wracking.   As for the episode: Dr. Phil totally wasn't acting, which I thought was an interesting dynamic between the characters."

Frasier,1g5kwu,DoctorSteve,6,Wed Jun 12 14:01:41 2013 UTC,I think we can argue the Crane brothers ethics.
Frasier,1g5kwu,DoctorSteve,1 point,Wed Jun 12 14:02:23 2013 UTC,"One could argue about the exact makeup of the brother's ethics, but I don't believe one can argue that their ethics are not deeply engrained in their characters. Frasier gets nauseated whenever he comes to breaching his ethics and Niles gets nosebleeds when he lies."
Frasier,1g5kwu,DoctorSteve,3,Wed Jun 12 14:21:23 2013 UTC,That's a funny joke for one episode. An early one at that. I dare you to find another instance or that.
Frasier,1g5kwu,KelsayGrammar,3,Wed Jun 12 14:38:22 2013 UTC,"Youre right. Frasier's queesiness doesn't show up again. However, whenever Niles lies in the series you'll see him bring his finger to his nose."
Frasier,1g5kwu,KelsayGrammar,1 point,Wed Jun 12 14:55:54 2013 UTC,I don't believe that. And if you're looking for consistency then he should faint when he sees his nose blood.
Frasier,1g5kwu,runway,2,Wed Jun 12 15:12:37 2013 UTC,"Ah, but he usually catches his nosebleeds before he sees them. One example of Niles nosebleeds is in the episode ""And Frasier Makes Three"" in the final season. When Martin gives Ronee Lil' Cupid's ring and asks Daphne and Niles to corroborate his tale Niles indicates he has a bloody nose. It also happens in the next episode, ""Detour,"" when he tells Daphne in the elevator that he and Frasier are going to split a case of oloroso."
Frasier,1g3lpm,VirtualAnarchy,28,Tue Jun 11 04:26:41 2013 UTC,There is no worst season of Frasier ever.
Frasier,1g3lpm,DoctorSteve,3,Tue Jun 11 04:47:48 2013 UTC,Yeah these questions bother me. Why would I try and find flaws in a show I thoroughly enjoy? It's on TV right now!!
Frasier,1g3lpm,IconicIsotope,17,Tue Jun 11 21:08:23 2013 UTC,"The last one, for 2 reasons:  1.) Too many attempts to tie up loose ends.  Nearly all sitcoms do this, where they force every character to have a happy ending (unless you are supposed to hate them then something bad happens).  It's too contrived and predictable; Frasier should have been better than that.  2.) It was the last one :("
Frasier,1g3lpm,KateEJHS,6,Tue Jun 11 04:57:47 2013 UTC,"My husband refuses to watch any episodes with Mel, so I would have to go with season 7."

Frasier,1g3lpm,Indydegrees2,3,Tue Jun 11 13:20:21 2013 UTC,"I'd have to agree with IconicIsotope, many TV shows have a tendency to cover all unanswered questions, leaving the last season feeling a little forced."
Frasier,1g3lpm,darktask,5,Tue Jun 11 11:01:03 2013 UTC,"Last season, because it was the last yes, but also because the matchmaker felt so fake and didn't seem to suit Frasier at all. I had a real sense of his attraction to her being out of character, and more of a settling/desperation thing. Seemed like a shoddy last love for the show."
Frasier,1g3lpm,socrates_scrotum,5,Tue Jun 11 14:29:11 2013 UTC,"Seasons 9 and 10. Oh sure, there is a good episode or two. But overall the show was stale."
Frasier,1g3lpm,IAmFrasierCrane,1 point,Tue Jun 11 15:25:04 2013 UTC,I agree that 9 and 10 were perhaps the weakest of the bunch. In the majority of the other seasons there is an overall character narrative that ties all the episodes together. In 9 and 10 the episodes stand alone.
Frasier,1g3lpm,theworldbystorm,2,Thu Jun 13 13:32:22 2013 UTC,"I agree that there is no worst season of Frasier.  If I had to choose one, though... I'd say season 8. It was kinda weird. I didn't like Frasier's mentor all that much and I didn't like Lana Langley. Frasier can do so much better than her. And Kirby is a punk."
Frasier,1g3lpm,IAmFrasierCrane,2,Tue Jun 11 23:09:56 2013 UTC,"Fun Fact: they change Lana's name. The first time she appears in season 7 her name is Lorna. Then, when she shows up again in season 8 it's Lana.  http://www.frasieronline.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4802"

Frasier,1g3lpm,Twiggy3,0,Fri Jul 12 21:47:55 2013 UTC,"8, 9 and 10 are quite awful (compared to the rest).  The stories turn into typical sitcom situations, the characters are pastiches of themselves and Jane Leeves acting somehow gets even worse.  I'd probably say 10."

I racked my brain for hours before I literally said, ""Eureka! I'll do a PR about Frasier Crane returning to Seattle to do a call-in-for-advice radio show.""

Frasier,1evg3f,thratty,4,Thu May 23 03:30:31 2013 UTC,I love the Bebe character Darling.
Frasier,1evg3f,KelsayGrammar,3,Thu May 23 04:12:33 2013 UTC,"Her description of what is ""so great about smoking"" made me start again.   Niles: There's no need to be insulting just because you're wrestling with an unhealthy and disgusting habit.  Bebe: It isn't disgusting; it's wonderful!  Frasier: Now, Bebe, what is so wonderful about smoking?  Bebe: Everything! I like the way a fresh firm pack feels in my hand. I like peeling away that little piece of cellophane and seeing it twinkle in the light. I like coaxing that first, sweet cylinder out of its hiding place and bringing it slowly up to my lips. Striking a match, watching it burst into a perfect little flame and knowing that soon that flame will be inside me!  [Begins displaying innuendo]  Bebe: I love the first puff, pulling it into my lungs... little fingers of smoking filling me, caressing me, feeling that warmth penetrate deeper and deeper until I think I'm going to burst!  [Frasier raises his eyebrow]  Bebe: Then 'woosh!'... watching it flow out of me in a lovely sinuous cloud, no two ever quite the same!  Daphne: [Visibly aroused, as are the others] More potatoes, anyone?"
Frasier,1evg3f,IconicIsotope,8,Thu May 23 08:27:32 2013 UTC,I prefer the nonsense focused ones as opposed to the dramatic ones.
Frasier,1evg3f,Stalked_Like_Corn,8,Thu May 23 02:25:39 2013 UTC,"My least favorites are near the end with Frasier and his romantic interest episodes.  Was just uninteresting and i purposely avoid watching the later seasons which sucks a bit because i like the Niles and Daphne together episodes that are mixed in.  I'm not sure i have a favorite but my favorite episode involves Frasier, Niles, and KACL.  ""Ham Radio"" is where they are trying to do the murder mystery broadcast and things just fall to pieces.  I've seen it dozens of times and I still laugh myself to tears.  It is well paced, the jokes are just perfectly timed and just how it shows the whole thing going to shit is hilarious.  If you've not seen it, please, watch it.  I think though, now that i'm thinking hard, some of my favs are more Niles centric.  Where he hits the free-throw, where he helps the NBA Player by letting him rub his head, and I can't recall the episode but it's where he's finally free of Maris and Daphne is single and he finally is getting the courage to tell her how he feels.  Frasier tells him to wait a day and she winds up dating a guy JUST like Niles.  At the end when Niles and Daphne are in the bar drinking and they play the ""what if"" game and she so non-chalantly says ""I love you Doctor Crane"" and he just gets this whole look at him and says ""I love you too"".  There was a LOT of emotion behind that and he nailed it.  He didn't over sell the line that would make the normal person say ""Wait, why did you say it like that to me"" but he said it in a way that YOU knew what he meant by it.  Another favorite of mine was an opening he did that was completely silent when he's trying to press his pants and he starts a fire, cuts himself, burns himself, etc."
Frasier,1evg3f,Stalked_Like_Corn,4,Thu May 23 05:38:06 2013 UTC,"Yes, the more I watch Frasier the more I like the Niles character. I might even like him more than Frasier himself. David Hyde Pierce is very talented. You should check out a movie called 'perfect host' which stars him. It really shows the range of characters he can play.   The episode with the silent Niles in the begining is called 'three valentines' and it's definitely a fan favorite. Niles is so funny with all the fainting and setting the couch on fire and all.  And yeah, the last few seasons on Frasier were nothing compared to the earlier seasons. Season 6 has lots of gems though. I'm watching that again right now and I find that Dinner Party is one of my fav episodes."

Frasier,1evg3f,john7720,7,Thu May 23 05:58:02 2013 UTC,"I liked the series' earlier season enders: ""You Can Go Home Again"", ""My Coffee With Niles"", ""Dark Victory"" (Seasons 1–3). They tended to reveal more of characters' deeper beliefs and feelings.   I also adore the episodes where Niles filled in for Frasier on his radio show.   I always thought that a spinoff that starred ""Niles"" would have been tremendously successful."
Frasier,1evg3f,squishymarshmallows,3,Thu May 23 03:52:43 2013 UTC,I believe they tried to do just that.  DHP wasn't interested though.

Frasier,1evg3f,muumuufats,2,Thu May 23 06:40:36 2013 UTC,I recently started watching the series again (currently on season 5) and I find the episodes revolving around Frasier and his love life to be my least favourite.

Frasier,1bcap6,LeChatMarin,9,Sun Mar 31 03:47:10 2013 UTC,"I disagree with the review on a few points - first, the pairing of Niles and Daphne wasn't a ""veer toward disaster"" - it actually provided Niles' character with an opportunity for a new angle: we'd seen him lovelorn and hopeless, but watching him flounder in a relationship with someone who actually respected him gave him new ground to break, and it was fantastic to see him in a fresh situation. It was always Frasier who was the main engine of the ""loneliness of the road less travelled"", and he carried it beautifully, so Niles finally finding love wasn't exactly a crippling blow, so to speak.  The review was also unkind to the characters of Frasier and Niles: while they were petty and pretentious, they were both innately very good men, and they did have a deep seated sense of right and wrong - they sometimes needed Martin or their respective brother to remind them of it, but they were still righteous men; this was sometimes highly comedic: Niles' ""We may be barbarians, but we pay for our looting"" was delightful. Martin, in kind, was often brash, arrogant and judgemental: he often needed to be reminded that his sons were now men, not the little boys he was used to scolding. This actually provided some of the great comedy of the show: Martin's sometimes necessary, sometimes ill-placed parenting highlighted his wisdom and shortcomings brilliantly, and when Frasier or Niles brought him back to earth it was genuinely pleasing to see the character realise how his sons had grown, and how much of himself he saw in them, despite their pretension and sophistication.   The episode The Ski Lodge that you mention is actually a little bit meta for the show - Frasier sometimes refers to the playwrite Noel Coward, and that episode was very Coward-esque, with the farcical style, the constant movement of the characters and the misplaced attraction.   As the show progressed, the characters seemed to grow into each other a little more, and accepted the strangeness of their escapades. When Martin tells Niles he has to be his gay boyfriend, and all Niles says is ""alright, but for how long?"" I nearly died laughing. There was nothing sad about that episode either, if nothing else it was a celebration of the character's inter-play, and their understanding and loyalty to one another."
Frasier,1bcap6,17Hongo,4,Sun Mar 31 04:26:11 2013 UTC,"I related a lot to Frasier - I'm not exactly a man of conventional pursuits. My tastes in music, literature and various other hobbies are not popular pursuits, and I've been referred to as a snob or a geek before.   I'm also quite close with my brother, so the Niles-Frasier dynamic was very entertaining for me, and hit quite close to the bone. Generally speaking, the show's characters were all very deep, and very interesting, and I found I had quite a lot in common with them."
Frasier,1bcap6,17Hongo,3,Sun Mar 31 21:31:11 2013 UTC,There's many Frasier fans who dislike the show from when Daphne and Niles are together. This is clearly one of those persons. It's something you simply have to live with as a Frasier fan. Don't let their sour attitude towards some episodes or arcs or seasons ruin your enjoyment though!

Also there was one episode which kinda centered around him .The episode where they show he's never unpacked even though he has been working at KACL for a while now . Zooey Deschanel plays Roz's cousin in that one. Anybody remember what season and episode that is ?  I am always amazed that almost ALL the supporting characters are just VERY GOOD ACTORS !

Frasier,1a8h33,ShittyFieldTech,5,Wed Apr 3 14:46:03 2013 UTC,This won't count but I loved the episodes where the former Cheers cast members would show up. I watched Frasier long before I watched Cheers so I didn't understand any of the references. A few months ago I watched the entire series of Cheers and then started Frasier back up. When I got to the episode where Sam comes back everything he said made so much sense and was insanely funny.  To answer your question I really enjoyed the Cam Winston vs Frasier rivalry.

Frasier,18olzf,watchthecrone,9,Sun Feb 17 07:33:44 2013 UTC,"It depends on if you mean where the photograph was taken from, or where Frasier's apartment would have to be for that to have been his view.  This view shows Two Union Square on the left, and the Space Needle on the right.  They're pretty close, it's got to be pretty close to a line drawn from Two Union Square to the Space Needle, which runs due northwest.  First, let's assume this is the actual view from some building.  The diameter of the Space Center's halo is 138 feet, and it fills the width of Frasier's door (3 feet?).  If the camera is 15 to 25 feet from the door, then the door is between 690 and 1150 feet from the Space Needle.  690 to 1150 feet northwest of the Space Needle puts Frasier's apartment somewhere inside Seattle Center, roughly between the International Fountain and the Seattle Repertory Theatre.  His apartment number is 1901, suggesting he's on the 19th floor.  In a typical American building (10 feet per story, no #13, ground floor is #1), that means his floor is about 170 feet above the ground.  There's no building in Seattle Center except the Space Needle which is anywhere near 170 feet tall, nor has there ever been.  So Frasier's apartment would have had to be floating in the air.  Now, if you want to know where the photograph was actually taken from, note that the top of the Columbia Center is just below the halo of the Needle.  Since we have two points, we can determine a line, and if we assume it was taken from the ground, we just have to trace that point back to where it intersects the ground.  By eyeballing it on a 3D map, it looks like it hits the ground near the north end of Seattle Center -- not far from where the size estimate put us before (suggesting a ""normal"" focal length lens).  So the producers probably had somebody run over to the north edge of the Seattle Center, take a photo with the Space Needle as big as possible, and then blow it up to make it look cool on screen.  Never mind that it would mean Frasier's luxurious 19th floor Queen Anne apartment would actually have the view you'd have in a first-floor apartment, across the street from the KeyArena, if your building was built so off-kilter you were looking 20 degrees up from the horizon.  Makes you wonder why he'd need to take the elevator, or why his piano didn't roll across the floor!"

The first 2 women he has a rehearsed plan of attack a glass of wine music a toast and they leave way before the date was over. The last woman he starts his rehearsed line of attack then finally stops to help his dad and sherry and the third woman sees what a kind person he actually is and the date continues.
Frasier,12cqgc,bdunbar,5,Wed Oct 31 04:33:36 2012 UTC,"This is more or less what sets this sitcom apart. Frasier is massively flawed and actually quite a ridiculous person. How forgiving you are depends on your own personality.  Obviously the show is hilarious, but the constant questioning of Frasier's relevance as a human being makes it much more than just a comedy.  Regarding the creators' intent, I can not decide. There are many episodes that resolve showing Frasier in a very positive light or as the guy who gets the last laugh, but these endings always seem improbable. It's possible the creators' (even Kelsey Grammer himself, being the executive producer) intended for viewers to overlook all of Frasier's flaws, but if they did then they're as deluded as Frasier."

I don't like that he's so snooty, but it's amazing to watch him go through his little dramas. I loved the Frasier Crane Day episode. I especially loved that in the end, he brought himself back down to earth and listened to the driver tell his tale."

Frasier,yfbyx,HippieUndead,28,Sat Aug 18 12:26:44 2012 UTC,I think the episode where Patrick Stewart becomes Frasier's sugar daddy is my favorite.
Frasier,yfbyx,greatestcape,2,Sat Aug 18 15:30:29 2012 UTC,One of my favourite episodes.

Frasier,yfbyx,SolarTea,9,Wed Sep 5 00:28:34 2012 UTC,I loved John C. McGinley as the plumber.

We've done so many jokey bits about Frasier dinner parties escalating to insane, violent levels over the years that it was a ridiculously specific dream come true.  And the movie totally lived up to those expectations. Brilliant film."

I know that he is not playing the same character, but I can totally see this being Niles if things had been different and he never left Marris.   David Hyde Pierce is one of my favorite actors."
Frasier,xk3jb,Artem_C,7,Thu Aug 2 11:12:06 2012 UTC,"He is driven near madness trying to prove that she is real. Besides a psychiatrist, he is still human and not always above it all :)"
Frasier,xk3jb,CuriouserNdCuriouser,1 point,Thu Aug 2 12:25:20 2012 UTC,"Besides if its not obvious he is a bit crazy. Sometimes I do think they push his craziness over the line seeing as being a psychiatrist he would have had to pass a psychiatric evaluation, and sometimes that is hard to believe. Niles is crazy as well but it is much more easy to believe he passed that evaluation. Though they may be great psychiatrists they are also humans(as you said) who make really stupid decisions sometimes."
Frasier,xk3jb,bender445,4,Sat Jan 19 08:33:36 2013 UTC,"It pushes said boundaries every so often, and is occasionally a little hard to watch for that reason. Pretty sure you have to keep going at least through the Niles/Daphne stuff.   Tl;dr keep watching. It's not a big downward spiral, it remains consistent enough."
Frasier,xk3jb,7ian,5,Thu Aug 2 18:17:02 2012 UTC,I agree that that moment is pretty ridiculous.  But keep watching: there are some great Season 5 episodes.

Frasier,uvh4f,thratty,3,Tue Jun 26 20:46:50 2012 UTC,"I watched sort of a ""Making of Frasier"" TV special, and when the show was still in the earlier stages someone remarked something along the lines of ""What's the point of this character? He is exactly like Frasier."" But the interaction between Frasier and Niles proved to be an indispensable part of the show."

Frasier,umqay,Twiggy3,5,Tue Jun 5 21:14:26 2012 UTC,"I disliked all the cameo's from the Cheers cast despite loving Cheers too.  yes Beware of Greeks was horrid too.  A lot of my least favorite episodes come in the last few seasons when it just centers on him trying to date someone.  The Casandra and Faye angle was played out longer then I thought.  The one he slept with at the radio station, forget her name but ""dirty girl"".  I didn't care for her and the episodes with her were just blech.  Especially the one where she left.  Was bitter sweet.  Bitter she was in it, sweet to watch her in it."

Frasier,umqay,squishymarshmallows,1 point,Wed Jun 6 08:26:32 2012 UTC,"I actually kinda liked the 'dirty girl' episodes, mostly because the first one or two were really strong.  But i generally agree, the ones centering on his trying to get a date were the weak point of the series."
Frasier,umqay,prodijy,5,Wed Aug 1 20:26:27 2012 UTC,"All the episodes with Julia. Eeech! hated the character, the actress and every plotline including her. So abrasive and unrealistic. Seemed very out of character for Frasier to like her, and for Roz to react so strongly."
Frasier,umqay,darktask,3,Tue Jun 26 20:51:54 2012 UTC,"I agree with this.  I hated the julia episodes too.  I couldn't understand why, just this one time, Roz went so batshit insane over the whole thing.  Plus, the Roz flipflopping on her new job drove me nuts as well."
Frasier,umqay,analogorithm,2,Fri Jun 29 13:09:22 2012 UTC,"I think Frasier had bad writers at the time, which is why the old writers undid all that stuff at the beginning of series 11."
Frasier,umqay,analogorithm,2,Mon Aug 13 07:25:50 2012 UTC,"It's been awhile, but I agree with that.  I knew there was a complete or partial switch of the writing staff late in the run, but they switched back to the originals to finish things out.  It seems rather obvious when watching the episodes, the former wit was transformed into bland jokes, and all that beautiful irony was left behind for obvious plot devices.  Pretty much all of the niles in the hospital episodes were poorly written as well as several arcs as we mentioned before."

I used to think it was a ridiculous plot and the lines in that episode would make me cringe.  Plus watching them try to act like rebels in a class was much too hard.  But the more I watch it, the more it kinda grows on me."
Frasier,umqay,analogorithm,2,Tue Oct 23 14:19:15 2012 UTC,I'm with you with Beware of Greeks and the Woody one. But I also can't stand that one with the greeting card that keeps playing an annoying tune. Can't remember the title!
Frasier,umqay,SinatraFan77,2,Wed Jun 6 01:34:30 2012 UTC,"Flour Child?  I don't have too much against that episode, there are probably worse episodes from that series."
Frasier,umqay,Planet-man,2,Wed Jun 6 06:16:12 2012 UTC,"The one I always automatically skip when I'm re-watching the series is ""Coots and Ladders.""  If you don't remember, that is the episode where Fraiser steals the medal from his neighbour and has to try and return it.    While I feel that Frasier is easily the best sit-com I've ever seen, it had it's fair share of cringes as well.  Complete story arcs in the series drove me batty.  I hated the whole arc where niles has heart surgery.  The Julia arc was terrible, in and of itself, but also the writing for all the main characters was way off as well.  The greeks episode was interesting, but why did they bring in this entire side of the family for a single episode?  Flour child was a whole new level of uncomfortable for me, I don't even bother watching that episode anymore.  Also, the one where they go to auto repair class, for whatever reason I just hate that episode."
Frasier,umqay,Planet-man,2,Fri Jun 29 13:16:09 2012 UTC,"Wooo am I late to this. But I would say the one where Diane shows up. Grossly unfunny, and I hate her in pretty much everything so much it is a passion.  However, I think all the Lilith ones are very funny."

Frasier,umqay,LibraryGal,1 point,Mon Aug 13 07:27:54 2012 UTC,"I can't believe all the hate for ""Beware Of Greeks"". I think it's one of the funniest episodes. And War of the Words too.   My least favourites would probably just be the insanely frustrating ones like the one where he dates the model played by Sela Ward and his family is so distrusting of him that he ruins the relationship just trying to prove it. I can't watch that one now."
Frasier,umqay,es2812,2,Sun Jun 10 14:48:33 2012 UTC,"Well, Frasier is full of cringey moments, which are loved and hated at the same time (by me at least).  I think the one that I find equally cringey to the ""Frasier's Imaginary Friend"" is probably the scene from ""Ask Me No Questions"", when he completely misunderstands what his date is trying to tell him due his being distracted by Niles' question."

Frasier,txuih,squishymarshmallows,5,Tue May 22 18:53:32 2012 UTC,For me it started as a way to distract my mind from wandering as I was falling asleep. It's funny and well written so I find it entertaining indefinitely!

Frasier,txuih,AmericasHigh5,3,Tue May 22 18:54:25 2012 UTC,"I really can't get enough of it. I'm watching right now! It's such perfect farce! Even if I'm not constantly cracking up like I do with other shows, Frasier's structure is absolutely untouchable. (It was my 21st birthday today. I was drinking. Forgive my enthusiasm. :) )"
Frasier,txuih,Twiggy3,2,Sat May 26 07:23:00 2012 UTC,Happy belated bday!  21 huh? Glad Frasier appeals to newer audiences. Even the older eps hold up pretty well huh?
Frasier,txuih,HippieUndead,3,Tue Jun 5 17:39:25 2012 UTC,I'm currently watching it every day on my computer. Great as a study break :)
Frasier,txuih,bender445,2,Sun Jun 10 12:03:00 2012 UTC,I watched the original run and have seen a number of episodes in syndication but now I am rewatching the whole thing on Netflix.  Started three weeks ago and am on season 8 already.  Lots of free time now that school is out
Frasier,txuih,electornblu,2,Tue May 22 03:23:57 2012 UTC,It depends.  Sometimes I watch random episodes and other times I watch Frasier series in order.  As I go to sleep I watch them (but with a timer to turn off the computer at a certain time).  You are not alone!
Frasier,spb34,OPR8R,3,Tue Apr 24 02:39:25 2012 UTC,Just found this subreddit.  Don't know why I never looked. I believe Frasier said this when he diagnosed Kenny during therapy after his divorce.
Frasier,spb34,zyguy,3,Tue Apr 24 05:10:01 2012 UTC,"he did, and I loved this joke!"
Frasier,rnwni,rule_27,4,Sun Apr 1 13:49:06 2012 UTC,Why don't I remember this? ಠ_ಠ What's the episode about?
Frasier,rnwni,Artem_C,3,Mon Apr 2 13:09:32 2012 UTC,"It's the episode where Frasier and Roz are nominated for a CB. To celebrate, Frasier is ""teaching"" Daphne how to ""properly"" open a 200 year old bottle of champagne."
Frasier,rnwni,theswedishshaft,3,Mon Apr 2 13:15:24 2012 UTC,"It's not CB, but Sea Bee (or a variation like Seabee). It's a Seattle Broadcasting award."
Frasier,rnwni,neurorex,2,Wed Jun 20 09:45:55 2012 UTC,"Ha, thanks. I obviously had no idea."
Frasier,pnvae,Artem_C,3,Mon Feb 13 19:46:55 2012 UTC,Pretty much any scene would make a great comic :D
Frasier,pnvae,Twiggy3,2,Mon Feb 13 22:53:29 2012 UTC,SOMEONE MAKE THE FIRST FRASIER FACE INTO A RAGE FACE!
Frasier,pnvae,Delta_6,3,Tue Feb 14 01:45:45 2012 UTC,Where are my manners?
Frasier,pnvae,Twiggy3,2,Tue Feb 14 02:27:27 2012 UTC,I burst out laughing.  This was a genius scene.
Frasier,pnvae,malousbal,2,Tue Feb 14 09:21:18 2012 UTC,That's good ridin'
Frasier,p4xj2,Twiggy3,2,Tue Jan 31 19:33:46 2012 UTC,"Great series, great song, and also pretty sound dietary advice."
Frasier,ojvri,Twiggy3,3,Mon Jan 16 22:16:06 2012 UTC,"Via Google I've found quite a few copies.  They are all for pay though.  If you are good with music you may be ac.e to construct the sheet music using http://www.onlinesheetmusic.com/tossed-salad-and-scrambled-eggs-p384523.aspx , the sheet music is only 2 pages long and there are just over a page of the music on that page, it may be the whole thing but I have no idea how to read sheet musix."
Frasier,ojvri,Delta_6,1 point,Tue Jan 17 19:48:24 2012 UTC,"Thank you.  I tried Google myself, but only found the non-free versions, sans preview."

Frasier,nzrn9,Twiggy3,2,Mon Jan 2 13:59:29 2012 UTC,"Haha, I love the scene from the literary characters party; these were always the funniest parts of Fraiser-when one character thinks one thing and is talking to someone who thinks they're talking about something else, that episode was a great example of it!"
Frasier,m25em,raydove9,6,Sun Nov 6 05:28:35 2011 UTC,"Frasier has had a lot of troubles with women though, and a huge element of the show was the heartbreak his character endured at various points in his life. He's a guy you relate to and pity at times, but are genuinely happy for when he succeeds."
Frasier,m25em,LOLOLOLno,2,Sun Nov 6 05:38:44 2011 UTC,"Yes exactly, I found myself cheering him on when it seemed like he found a relationship that was working and then audibly cursing his existence while watching his self destructive behavior play out on screen thus ruining everything."
Frasier,m25em,calculuzz,5,Sun Nov 6 05:44:43 2011 UTC,"Well, he can be quite charming, to explain how he ""got"" so many women. He's also extremely intelligent and successful, something women tend to go for. And he's very cute sometimes albeit a bit older."
Frasier,lqrul,Twiggy3,9,Thu Oct 27 08:35:26 2011 UTC,"Off the top of my head and paraphrasing:     Frasier: If less is more, imagine how much more more is    Frasier: I would shave my head for you Niles. Niles: A gesture that becomes less significant with each passing year    Frasier: Aunt Zora, I made a promise to you and I will die before I break it Aunt Zora: Or soon after"

Frasier,lqrul,LOLOLOLno,5,Thu Oct 27 16:32:42 2011 UTC,"Well, you could always use the KACL website for the transcripts.  A few I've thought of recently (but not necessarily my all time favourite):   Back in prep school the existentialist club voted me most likely to be Dear God! You never fold cashmere, you'll misdirect the knap! I have cut back. Last month I told my masseur I could only see him once a week. All my life I have dreamed of one thing: the day I could go into a library, go to the card catalogue and see my name under ""Mental Illness."" I cut myself because I was shaving with no water, and why was there no water? Because I had to move your chair which gouged the floor which made me call for Joe who found bad pipes which called for Cecil who ate the cat who killed the rat that lived in the house that Frasier built! Do you believe this guys grandiosity! I'm God and he knows it! Don't get me started on rationalistic pantheism or there goes the whole three hours! ‎But those people are usually rigid little demagogues who don't know the difference between the kind of respect that is earned and the kind of respect that is irrespective... of what others expect."
Frasier,lqrul,speckledlemon,3,Thu Oct 27 17:08:10 2011 UTC,It's a shame when bad things happen to good sentences...
Frasier,lqrul,bigglesby,3,Sun Nov 13 03:58:03 2011 UTC,Niles: The man has community college written all over him!    Niles: She's managed to have her urinal cake and eat it too!

Frasier,lqrul,dumaa,3,Sat Oct 29 08:06:34 2011 UTC,"I frequently use a reserved, reproachful, bitter ""I see."" after a slight pause, when met with disappointing or mock-disappointing information."
Frasier,lqrul,nonstoppussypounder,2,Thu Feb 23 05:52:24 2012 UTC,"Frasier:  [dialing]  Oh, God.  Ah, it's her machine.  Hello, Tricia,            it's Frasier.  Look, I'm, I'm terribly sorry but it's just            my car battery went dead at a light, and I didn't have my            cell phone with me.  By the time I got a jump I realized I            couldn't go directly to the restauraunt because I was wearing            these ridiculous shorts, and I, I know how this sounds, but            it's the truth!  Here, just ask my brother.  [He holds the            phone out to Niles.]  Niles:  They're ridiculous shorts."
Frasier,jong0,darktask,2,Sat Aug 20 06:15:05 2011 UTC,I picture Frasier finding another bar to frequent in Chicago.
Frasier,jong0,palehorse864,2,Sat Oct 15 23:10:18 2011 UTC,"Hard to say, but Frasier was definitely going after Charlotte and I picture them eventually getting married and having a kid. Niles and Daphne would also have at least one more kid. It's a pity they haven't done a reunion show taking place during Frasier and Charlotte's wedding."
Frasier,jong0,Planet-man,1 point,Thu Feb 2 09:11:46 2012 UTC,"A while ago Kelsey Grammer tweeted a question, asking if anyone would be interested in watching a show about Frasier and Niles' children, with he and DHP popping in from time to time. It sounded like just an off-the-cuff idea, and hadn't been fleshed out at all... but I don't think it sounded like a good idea.  I'd like to revisit the characters, but not like that."
Frasier,jong0,yojumbo,9,Sun Mar 25 04:58:38 2012 UTC,"Hahaha, my best friend and I had the idea that they should do a series called Frederick, about a grown-up Frederick working as a radio psychiatrist in Seattle, with Kelsey Grammer playing Frederick, DHP playing his cousin/best friend/rival David, Peri Gilpin as Frederick's promiscuous producer Alice Doyle and John Mahoney as an elderly Frasier, who's taken a liking to dogs and is raising one of Eddie's puppies, Edison. As his housekeeper, old Frasier hires Daphne's niece(the cross-eyed four-year-old from England, mentioned when Daphne runs out on her wedding), whom David quickly falls in love with."
Frasier,jong0,Planet-man,3,Tue Mar 27 02:30:25 2012 UTC,This... This is brilliant!!
Frasier,jew6d,theearthvolta,3,Wed Aug 10 19:33:06 2011 UTC,"They play it for 3 hours every night here in Houston. Its on the Hallmark channel, I'm not sure how national that channel is. Love this show! Maris just murdered her Argentinian boyfriend.  I like the newer Frasier episodes better than the older ones. What about you?"
Frasier,jew6d,ivy627,3,Thu Aug 11 05:05:24 2011 UTC,Every season is hilarious. I'm guessing most of the people here are too young to remember the show.
Frasier,jew6d,easytiger,2,Thu Aug 11 16:06:13 2011 UTC,I'm watching it as I type this very sentence.
