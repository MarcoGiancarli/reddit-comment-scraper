ShittyMapPorn,3crhfd,Hominid77777,12,Fri Jul 10 15:10:43 2015 UTC,What I don't get is that there already are pretty well defined and agreed upon cultural regions in the United States. Why try and reinvent the wheel. The areas don't even make geographical sense so it's clear the creation was trying to make cultural distinctions that are even less reality-based. What pains me is I saw someone using this as a reference to cultural boundaries in America.
ShittyMapPorn,3crhfd,onthemile,10,Fri Jul 10 15:06:45 2015 UTC,"I can't even figure out what the cultural commonalities are supposed to be.  There are significant differences in economy, accent/dialect, religiosity, geography (and hence leisure activities—lake fishing/boating is very different from the sea) within several of those zones.    Also, the difference between urban/rural in so many of these places is gigantic.  For instance, the liberal, gay-friendly, high tech, ethnically diverse metros of Denver and Salt Lake City are seen as heathen hellholes by the conservative rural areas surrounding them.  Hell, the difference between the mountain towns of Colorado and the plains towns is more than enough to warrant different divisions."

I live in one of the ""midlands"" counties and it's one of the 10 most affluent in the country and incredibly liberal. Yet he describes it as ""organized around the middle class. Government intrusion is unwelcome.""   Unfortunately, it almost makes the logic behind the map make even less sense and certainly doesn't answer your question."

I'm assuming that you're taking up this fight against conservatism not as an act of hate but as an act of love for those you perceive them to be harming.

The implicature, correct me if I'm wrong, is that he is not a trukult conservative, because he is lamenting bigots giving conservatives a bad rap. Am I correct thus far?"

ShittyMapPorn,3bapop,truthseeeker,2,Sun Jun 28 02:14:47 2015 UTC,"Your comment led me to do some research. The current numbers back you up. Nigeria(2013) was $522 billion while Hawaii is listed at $78 billion for 2015. However, that map is at least 8 years old, and things have changed very quickly. In 1997, merely 18 years ago, Hawaii actually topped Nigeria $38 billion to $35 billion. Most likely this 2007 mapmaker used 2000 statistics that had the 2 economies very close. I hadn't realized until now how much the Nigerian has skyrocketed recently. In 2009 it was $170 billion, meaning it basically tripled in 4 years, which does sound unlikely."

However, in this particular case, I don't see an immediate reason why that would be a desirable thing to avoid.  I wish this map preserved spatial relations, I think that might be somewhat interesting.  As an aside, I think I've seen this type of chart a few times before, and I think it can make sense, when you want to think of each state as an equal unit.  Where I've seen this chart most successfully deployed is looking at the legal status of some issue state by state.  That's a situation where we often care about specifically the number of states, because that's the increment in which things change.  This chart can give you quick idea of the number of states doing a given thing, and a general idea of the geographic distribution, although without a lot of precision. That said, there might be simpler, less stylized way to do a uniform state cartogram."

Believe it or not, I actually found Sibera to be a land of stunning natural beauty, thriving industry, and fascinating cultures.  There are several cities with more than a million people, and one, Novosibirsk, is actually huge and quite cosmopolitan, often called the Chicago of Siberia. There's also Yekaterinburg, Irkutsk, Ulan Ude and some others that are all actually very large.  Ulan Ude in particular is fascinating, as it is the capital of the Buryat Republic -- the Buryats are a deputy branch of Mongols, and there are hundreds of thousands in the Buryat Republic (like a US state) alone. They comprise one of many ethnic groups in Siberia, and fascinatingly, there are also thriving communities of 'indigenous' people, the largest group being the Chukchis, who are related to the Inuit/Eskimos of Alaska and Canada. The Russians, if you'll believe this, were actually much more tolerant of natives than the colonisers of the New World, so there are plenty of them to be found today.  Vladivostok isn't technically in Siberia, but it's still in the Russian Far East, and it reminded me of nothing so much as San Francisco.  If you get the chance, check it out -- or just do some reading. Siberia is a fascinating place!"

ShittyMapPorn,38tmql,strolls,8,Sat Jun 6 19:16:48 2015 UTC,"But is that really a point?  Data like maps are used to convey some sort of message through them, or to just give detailed information in context.  If we knew what the languages were, the second would be true, and it would be interesting to know something about what these languages are and a little about them.  But this map is just terribly vague and pointless.  Is it trying to convey that some countries are suppressing native languages?  I don't know, there are a lot of aboriginal languages dying in Australia, but is that active suppression or just aboriginals assimilating into Australian society?  I assume that there is a little of both throughout the map, but who knows, all this map tells is how endangered it is.    Telling ""where"" these languages are endangered is nothing.  You need ""what"" and ""why"" to make a meaningful map."

Technically Bosnia shouldn't be independent, since it didn't formally declare independence until '92, but the Memorandum on Sovereignty was declared on October 15, so I'd wager this map was made after that.

If a majority of Americans (or people - the link only addresses Americans) don't look at maps and don't know much about geography, it doesn't make it an inaccurate statement to say that the person who drew this map is one of them."
ShittyMapPorn,37nvml,Von_Kissenburg,2,Fri May 29 06:57:37 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't.  Your point seemed to be that anyone who ISN'T 8 years old or anyone who has seen a map more than a couple times should be able to do this, or better. This shows that is not the case. Fully functioning adults have very low geographic skills. You can debate the necessity of these skills, because honestly with GPS how often to people use maps to navigate any more? If not for navigation, maps become more niche, used for personal interest, and how many Americans' daily lives depend on being able to locate Qatar or Vanuatu, or even Mexico, on a map? Probably not many."

Not where. What.   That strikes me as an unacceptably low level of knowledge for an educated, aware, and most of all, voting grown-up, especially given that whole ""World War Two"" dustup we had, somewhere in the apparently misty past. Either explain to us why this is okay, or get the hell off his case.   Or I guess you can downvote me and move on without giving it another thought, but I still find it pretty scary that this is an acceptable standard for people who pick their own leaders."

So they got a C- in a 10th grade world history class. They seem to have a stronger understanding of where more relevant locations, like Iraq, Iran, and the general area where ISIS has influence are. These are more likely to impact their daily lives, but even in that case the concept of these places is more paramount than their geographical location.  As far as mixing up Rome/Italy and Tokyo/Japan, it's only anecdotal but I knew several people in college who were unaware that Chicago isn't a state. That's more relevant than another country."

I was responding to someone who said this wasn't a poor attempt.  It's a very poor attempt.  Anyone over 8 years old who looks at maps and remembers what they learn in geography class could do a better job.  If you asked me to draw a map, would it be perfect?  No, far from it, and I'm someone who's casually interested in maps and geography, but I would do a damn sight better than this.  If this flies as ""not bad"" we're setting the bar way too low."

Everyone knows that the Southern Island is the location of Rome, and it can be explained very simply; You see that Italy is shaped like a large Boot that -kicks- Rome? Well, Rome [/ˈroʊm/] was previously known as ""Rømme"" which is an old Latin-skandi word for ""Sour-Cream"" which was a very popular Side-dish/dip in the early Roman history [500bc-500ac] (We know this from excavations-work done around Napoli and Pompeii in recent times). The Boot kicks Rome (or ""Rømme"") and in ancient Roman history, Kicking a bucket of sour-cream (Or Kicking Rømme [rome]) is a sign of Luxuriance and charity. So figuratively; Italy is Kicking Rome [signalizing the richness/lavishness of the years to come] and that is how Rome got its location, hence; its name! It is common knowledge!  yes The relative length of a country is the size of a country relative with it's theoretical position [which in this case is Norway and Rome] I could elaborate on this, but i don't want to waste your time ;)"

ShittyMapPorn,34sqd6,bilscuits,16,Mon May 4 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they have full service stations in New Jersey and Oregon, and they have attendants who fill the tank for you. You aren't allowed to just get out and do it yourself. It's stupid."
ShittyMapPorn,34sqd6,ArttuH5N1,13,Mon May 4 16:12:04 2015 UTC,That sounds really dumb. Why make such a law?
ShittyMapPorn,34sqd6,bilscuits,8,Mon May 4 16:33:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I think it's a relic from a time when your average person probably couldn't be trusted to pump their own gas. It's been pretty idiot-proof for decades now, but these two states haven't changed their archaic laws on this because there are people whose jobs depend on it. It's just dumb since people in those states are being forced to pay for something they have no interest in buying.   Give people a choice between having someone pump their gas and saving a few cents a gallon doing it yourself, and people will overwhelmingly choose self-service. That's why you never see full service stations anywhere except where they're legally required."

ShittyMapPorn,34sqd6,MaxCHEATER64,4,Mon May 4 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"It's also a convenience thing. Here in NJ you can roll up to the pump, tell the attendant to fill it up, go into the store, buy a snack, pay for the pump at the register, and then leave the store and just get in your car and drive off.  If you're not buying anything, you can just give the attendant your money and sit in your car for a few minutes. It gets rather cold in Jersey during the winter - it's nice to not have to exit your vehicle, even for just a small amount of time."
ShittyMapPorn,34sqd6,ArttuH5N1,3,Tue May 5 00:18:54 2015 UTC,"I guess that's more convenient, in a way. How is paying with a card handled with attendants? Here in Finland majority of stations and/or pumps are cold ones, so no attendants or paying with cash. To me it's convenient in the way that I don't have to be paying for someone's work I don't really need. Cold weather hasn't really been a problem for me, but I can see how it could be easier and nicer to just stay in your car. But it really seems like a such an outdated thing and a solution to a problem which doesn't really exist. Especially when the wast majority of people seem to be in favor of cold stations in places where the law allows them."
ShittyMapPorn,34sqd6,MaxCHEATER64,4,Tue May 5 00:24:20 2015 UTC,You just give them your card and they'll swipe it for you.
ShittyMapPorn,34sqd6,ArttuH5N1,3,Tue May 5 00:27:34 2015 UTC,"What about the PIN? Is it like in bars, you give them the card and they hand back the machine for the PIN? In your experience, which are faster, the cold stations or the ones with an attendant? Seems like, if fully manned, the ones with an attendant would be faster, but if it's similar to cashiers vs. self checkout situation, cold stations would ""win"" in that regard. And that's the most important part for me, how fast the whole thing is. (I hate it when I'm not on a cold station and some asshat just leaves their car on the cash pump, goes in and has to stand in line to pay. Wastes everyone's time!)"
ShittyMapPorn,34sqd6,MaxCHEATER64,3,Tue May 5 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"What about the PIN? Is it like in bars, you give them the card and they hand back the machine for the PIN?   You really can't use debit - not that anybody really wants to.   It's also worth saying that the card swipes are part of the pumps themselves, not separate machines. If you pay in cash, the attendant just puts the cash in their money belt and takes it back to the register which is usually located in a locked glass room near the center of the gas station.   In your experience, which are faster, the cold stations or the ones with an attendant?    Comparing the manned stations in NJ to the unmanned stations in NY/PA I really can't say there's much of a difference. It might be a little bit slower but most of the time comes from waiting for the attendant to first arrive.   (I hate it when I'm not on a cold station and some asshat just leaves their car on the cash pump, goes in and has to stand in line to pay. Wastes everyone's time!)   That's never a problem here. There's always more 'open' pumps than there are attendants, so you just pull up to the first pump you see and wait for one of the attendants to come over. The only time there's ever lines at the gas station is when there's a ridiculous amount of people going there at once, and this only really happens before natural disasters."
ShittyMapPorn,34sqd6,FearTheZ,4,Tue May 5 00:49:31 2015 UTC,That is not entirely true.  I live in New Jersey and you can pump your own gas in certain circumstances.  If the attendant is swamped and is taking a while to get to your car people often start the pump themselves.
ShittyMapPorn,34sqd6,bilscuits,5,Mon May 4 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"Well from what I understand that's not exactly legal, but since it's something the entire rest of the country manages to do without any problem at all they're probably lax on enforcement."

IMO there should be a prohibition on posting wikimedia content here, though, unless you've fixed it.  I'm going to sound self-righteous writing this, for which I apologise, but if you can do a better job of any map on wikimedia, all you have to do is click the ""edit"" button and upload an improved version.  Any ""shitty"" maps you see on wikipedia are the result of volunteers doing their best. The publishers of maps and atlases pay professional cartographers and proof-readers, whereas wikimedia only has people like you and me."

ShittyMapPorn,347zlm,legitstickman,31,Wed Apr 29 00:53:05 2015 UTC,"I actually don't mind this style of map. It makes every state the same size, making it easier to tell what % of states support/do not support an issue. When they're different sizes, it can make it look like the majority of the states upport an idea, when that is not the case. The 2012 election is a good example of this. It looks like Romney has more support because the states he won are bigger than the staes Obama won.  The lack of a key, on the other hand, is annoying."
ShittyMapPorn,347zlm,TDenverFan,15,Wed Apr 29 05:22:29 2015 UTC,"Such a worthy point. It's not really a map, or even cartogram - it's just a communicative tool.

It just needs to represent the physical space well enough so a reader can find the state you want near where you expect it to be, and it does that fine.

ShittyMapPorn,349vm6,E-werd,2,Wed Apr 29 13:31:41 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of questions that can't be answered by looking at the map.  Sometimes Google Maps will make assumptions and label something as a road under a certain name when it is actually just a service road that continues in what would otherwise be the same path of a legitimate road.  Make sure you're using Earth/Arial view.  It looks like the legitimate part of Elvira Rd stops at the train tracks, the rest is service road.  If you follow the trails in the woods, you can see where it crosses over Scout Creek and comes up the hill to meet Stadium Trace Pkwy.   As for the police shooting range, sometimes municipalities have to give something a name.  The town I live in has about 4 instances of ""Hazel Avenue"" in the ~6 square miles it exists.  They're generally in different boroughs, but even still they separate the lot numbers so that they can't overlap."

Europe would end at the Carpathians.   Unless there was a river capable of supporting trade between the Mediterranean and the Ukranian Sea, Troy would've never existed, for one. The Ancient Persians would've probably swept the Balkans, the Ottomans definitely would've.

ShittyMapPorn,33r4rt,Happy_SAP,5,Fri Apr 24 20:51:59 2015 UTC,"Okay, could someone explain what's wrong with the Trans-Pacific Partnership? I looked it up on Google and found a site that looked quite anti-ttp, just to see the worst of it and they seem to be making arguments which, though valid, seem to have a lack of understanding of economics and international relations. There arguments are quite short term, at least in my opinion. If anyone could argue a case against it please do. The website I went to was Exposethettp.org."
ShittyMapPorn,33r4rt,Happy_SAP,2,Sat Apr 25 09:53:02 2015 UTC,"The copyright angle gets a lot of discussion around here, but there's way more to it than that. Here's a good rundown. See also the original source of the shitty map. Not all economists support it, not by a long shot. There's also the fact that it has been negotiated in secret and that the ""fast track"" proposal Congress is being asked to approve makes it impossible to make any amendments. The whole idea is unapologetically anti-democratic.  Libertarians love to argue that they are the only ones who understand economics and that everyone else is an idiot. Here is a TPP-specific explanation of the problems with that. See also /r/TPP."
ShittyMapPorn,33r4rt,whitepalms85,3,Sat Apr 25 17:23:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting,  Thank You for giving me the other side of this. Now I have to mull it over. I, myself, am usually for liberalizing economics and world trade so I'm still on the fence and have to read into it more. I also believe the China scare is also over done and over simplified, so any argument that goes after that I usually discount. I actually was going to stop reading the comic after a bit because his arguments seem oversimplified but then he caught me and acknowledge that, which I respect and he also account for them. So, I have to think about it more and make a decision for what side of the fence I stand on.  Thank You"
ShittyMapPorn,33r4rt,Happy_SAP,3,Sat Apr 25 22:51:42 2015 UTC,You're welcome.
ShittyMapPorn,33r4rt,slibsirk,7,Sat Apr 25 23:59:54 2015 UTC,"I have yet to meet a person that is against the TPP and not an idiot. It's mainly far left wingers with no understanding of economics. They are pretty much on the same level as climate change deniers. Pretty much every economist agrees that free trade is a positive thing. I think the main problem is that they don't understand the difference between 'making the cake bigger' and 'who gets how much of the cake'. Free trade makes the cake bigger and if they are unhappy with the distribution, which might be a legit concern in some areas, then that's another issue and not reason to reject free trade. They are basically saying that nobody should get anything if they don't get what they want. It's morally totally wrong and unethical. Also they are usually more concerned about some special interest groups than general public. E.g. farmers are often indirectly subsidized by the public as they can charge higher prices because they operate in protected markets. Opening up markets would put pressure on them, some would even loss their jobs but the public would be better off."
ShittyMapPorn,33r4rt,Happy_SAP,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:58:33 2015 UTC,"That was the feeling I was getting from it. The site tried to argue that NAFTA was bad for the US even though the country that got the least out of it was Mexico and they still wanted it and have done better because of it and will continue to now that Mexican wages are lower then Chinese ones. Overall I see nothing wrong with TPP, though I do wish the negotiations were more open but I can see why they would be secret, as many of those States have large trade relations with China too."
ShittyMapPorn,33r4rt,TheRumpletiltskin,2,Sat Apr 25 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"From my understanding this is like SOPA and PIPA because it fucks over pirates big time and strengthens the shitty parts of copyright law, for example corporations like Disney holding Mickey Mouse for ever.   On the EFF I read that just for pirating, without a claim from the corporation who owns it you can get jail time or your property seized from you."
ShittyMapPorn,33r4rt,Professor-Reddit,5,Sat Apr 25 12:51:51 2015 UTC,"The website I looked at, was trying to argue this but it made it seem that it would be bad in terms of copyright but only to the extent that companies could exert their influence overseas. This more calls for a reform of copyright law then to shut down the trade agreement."

Edit: now I understand you were saying that Tokyo is the larger by metropolitan area, not saying shanghai was. When shanghai is a larger city proper. Two different things.  The definition of city population is way to arbitrary, there needs to be a far more well defined category. Having a city proper vary so widely from one city by the next due to distracting and stuff like that skews things.

So if we say full time were lookin at 15,360 in a year before taxes.  That's 1280.00 a month,  before taxes.  My apartment rent pending waste tax and water was roughly 750.00. Electric bill was 40 to 80 pending if I had company over to hangout or watch TV. My phone was about 50.00 a month.  That leaves us about 440.00 a month, again with out taxes. Usually with the tax bracket I was in,  the government usually took the rest of that.  I'd be lucky if I had 100 to 150 left.  In which case I'd be lucky enough to buy groceries. In my area to have a 1 bedroom apartment on min wage in a relatively safe area is close to impossible. You could live fairly comfortable in a studio in a super sketchy area."

ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,TheSouthernBelle,3,Sat Apr 11 16:33:23 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I didn't have a choice at the time.  I was homeless prior so I was just trying to find a place to live.  I wasn't really in a good position to search for roommates.
ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,FSMonToast,2,Sat Apr 11 21:52:19 2015 UTC,Craigslist and the public library. I too played that game once.
ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,TheSouthernBelle,5,Sat Apr 11 22:19:27 2015 UTC,I did that too.  $7.25 minimum wage and a one bedroom apartment not even a mile from campus in a large college town.
ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,Kaffiene6,4,Sat Apr 11 22:37:36 2015 UTC,College towns are an exception as I was able to get a 4 Bedroom 2 bathroom apartment for $1000 a month ($250 per person)
ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,pezdeath,3,Sat Apr 11 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. In my college town, housing prices are massively inflated. However, I think that has something to do with the fact that basically every apartment is controlled by one of only 4 or 5 different companies.

ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,IWugYouWugHeSheMeWug,3,Sat Apr 11 23:59:43 2015 UTC,I agree. Near campus though is terrible. $650 a month for 1 bedroom in a 4 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment. 1 mile away I'm getting a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom for $750 a month plus utilities (estimated to be about $450 per person)

ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,numb3red,5,Sat Apr 11 16:53:23 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to why people think you can make a living off of the least amount of money you can possibly earn from a full-time job.
ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,allthediamonds,2,Sat Apr 11 22:36:49 2015 UTC,There are many countries where you can.

ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,Vhers_Vysca,4,Sun Apr 12 01:08:15 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I spent quite some time trying to develop a response involving the differences between the sizes, population, and job availability between the two countries but concluded that I didn't know enough about this topic to make a definitive point about it.   What I do have, though, is anecdotal evidence. I don't know where you're from, or how you live, or what you've been through. But as someone from America whose family spent ~5 years dancing over and under the poverty line, I can tell you that it sucks.  There's a difference between 'surviving' and 'living,' and when you make 8 dollars an hour, that difference is painfully clear."
ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,numb3red,3,Sun Apr 12 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm curious as to why people think you should always be able to make a living off of the least amount of money you can possibly earn from a full-time job."

ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,numb3red,6,Sun Apr 12 00:41:35 2015 UTC,"Emphasis on the least amount of money you can possibly make.  It's ridiculous to think that every single job, no matter how insignificant, can pay for an average-priced apartment. If every job payed out that much the unemployment rate would skyrocket. You can't expect businesses to just pay more and not get anything more, they would just hire less people."
ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,kkjdroid,4,Sun Apr 12 00:43:06 2015 UTC,"Why would businesses pay more for positions with lots of people available, and why should people working 40 hours/week be homeless?"
ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,numb3red,2,Sun Apr 12 00:48:25 2015 UTC,Why would businesses pay more for positions with lots of people available   A high minimum wage makes them pay more... That's the entire point of this conversation.   and why should people working 40 hours/week be homeless?   It depends on the job. 40 hours a week of burger flipping isn't necessarily going to make you a living.
ShittyMapPorn,327mzb,kkjdroid,2,Sun Apr 12 05:20:20 2015 UTC,"A high minimum wage makes them pay more... That's the entire point of this conversation.   Exactly. They wouldn't do it otherwise.   It depends on the job. 40 hours a week of burger flipping isn't necessarily going to make you a living.   Why shouldn't it? You're employed, you're getting up at the same time as everyone else, working all day, and going home.

Wikimedia hosts a variety of blank maps available to be coloured in, including ones centred on the pacific or, to preserve a consistent style, you could cut that one apart in an SVG editor.  I probably spent the best part of an hour today editing just one wikipedia page, trying to be precise and lucid, and including 3 or 4 good citations. I don't think many people appreciate the amount of work it takes to make wikipedia as useful as it is.

It allows each state to be represented in equal area and it's much easier to see the actual progression of gay marriage laws in the US.  For instance, if you present a normal map of the US with only the largest 8 states banning gay marriage, you'd think ""wow most of the US has banned gay marriage!"" when in fact it's only a few of states that take up a significant portion of the surface area.   Using this format, each state has an equal area and it's easier to get a better sense of the actual numbers being presented. It's more about the percentage of states banning gay marriage than the size of the states involved.  That said, they really should have used a different color..."

I don't know how a more complicated Border should be faster. For example Kentucky/Virginia is a straight line, thats 2 clicks. In this case there is absolutely no need to be exact since it probably targets Tourists who dont know the borders anyway.  Whats remarkably though is the Country-Border which is way more accurate than the states."
ShittyMapPorn,304qnk,normanhome,25,Tue Mar 24 16:52:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think the sweeping borders are the central problem. Heck, I actually like them for a summary map.  The problems and their substantiations:  1) You give visitors invalid names for regions. Ohio is not in the Northeast, let alone Minnesota. If a visitor said ""I want to visit the Northeast. What's in Minnesota?"" We Americans would consider these unrelated statements. It's like that craptastic 2008 song ""American Boy"".  The USA is huge. Visitors show up at JFK and think they can hike to New England they way they'd hike in Europe (towns every few miles, no tent). It's a huge shock when they learn Chicago is 1500 km from NYC. The map needs to convey ""this bit isn't a damn lick near that bit and you will need a flight"". Putting a bunch of random states into the Northeast exacerbates the situation.  2) The map mentions Atlantic City as a place to go but DITCHED ITS STATE. This is the kind of problem that sets off a lot of people. It would also make it hard for the visitor to get to Atlantic City, which can be confusing enough.  New Jersey is a small but populous state. It has a surprising level of tourism. To blur it out is like having a map of Europe without Belgium."

In fact it can be fun to explain using the examples you provided:  Before the age of railroads, it took one week to get from London to Edinburgh. In the modern day, it takes a week to drive from New York to Anchorage.  In both cases, you may say ""then get on a plane!"" Precisely. You're traversing biomes, not just distances.  I can shock my coworkers in India when I tell them I drove the 5000 km (five megameters) from our Boston office to Los Angeles. It means nothing to them if I say ""3000 miles"". It means something real to say that I did this drive, that I still drive the same car, that it took six days (I spent a day in Denver), that I covered the last 800 miles (1300 km) in one day, that I never reached a border control until I came across the fruit inspection station after I entered California."

Everyone just complained about the borders which are ok in my eyes. Invalid names and places are horrible I agree. I'm still unsure about the Northeast, etc since I don't know the concept behind them. Maybe in the more detailed text it gets cleared up"
ShittyMapPorn,304qnk,normanhome,16,Tue Mar 24 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"The northeast of the US has two parts: New England (the six states east of New York state) and the Mid-Atlantic (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware). This area encompasses a huge amount of the historical US, lots of the battle sites of the American Revolution, and a huge amount of the population. It's famously liberal in its politics, it's one of the few parts with working trains, it's where I grew up.  The Northeast ends with two very explicit borders: the Mason-Dixon Line (the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland as well as PA and Delaware) and the Penn/Ohio border.  Ohio is the beginning of the Midwest, as it was one of five states carved out of the Northwest Ordinance of 1785 (Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin). Whereas the northeast was English colonies (except for New Jersey and Delaware), this near portion of the Midwest (the Midwest itself continues into the eastern Plains states -- Iowa, Minnesota...), these had been French turf that never got settled. Thus they got surveyed into square-mile regions suitable to the flat territory.  The Mason-Dixon Line is exceedingly important. The South begins after it. Maryland did not secede from the Union during the Civil War, but it still had slaves and thought wicked hard about leaving. The South is not the Northeast, and each side is still... defensive.  Side note: When Americans from the South visit England and get clumped into the term ""Yanks"", expect fights. Southerns fought the pernicious Yankee hordes and are willing to fight again. Even non-Southerners get angry: ""I'm from Queens. I don't root for the stupid Yankees. Go Mets!"" (Translation: just because you live near Arsenal doesn't mean you cheer for Arsenal.)  Clumping South Dakota into the Northeast is like clumping Yorkshire into metro London or Bayonne into metro Paris. You're on crack."
ShittyMapPorn,304qnk,pseydtonne,2,Tue Mar 24 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but New Jersey and Hawaii.  There's loose tracing then there's guessing."
ShittyMapPorn,304qnk,SpaceOdysseus,9,Tue Mar 24 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"These are just opinions: Well if we are calling Wyoming ""the west"" then so is Idaho and Montana (especially since Montana has an airport and national park listed). Also it should really be ""The Northeast and Midwest"" if you are going that far into the interior. Finally calling Kentucky part of the south is just bad for your health. Also, as a native of Washington there are multiple major national parks they don't mention. One of which is the largest goddamn (temperate) rainforest in the world.  Now for facts: missing states include New Jersey (not that anyone would want to visit it) and Alaska (which is actually decently nice to visit). Also those state boarders are atrocious, and end up misplacing a number of cities. Portland is on the edge of Washington (like actually on the border), not like a 100 miles from it. Also Seattle is like at least 50 miles off. California's cities are just oddly placed due to the relative size of California with the wacky borders. The capital is just on the wrong goddamn half of Virgina, it's in completely the wrong place and has nothing to do with how the borders are drawn. I'm sure locals of the other cities would agree they are poorly placed in some respect or another."

Generally in states with decriminalization you are able to posses small amounts (under an ounce or something like that) without being prosecuted.  You still might face a citation (similar to a traffic ticket) and confiscation of your cannabis.  It varies by state so that was some broad strokes but again, decriminalized does not mean legal."

Looking at the map again, Kashmir may even be part of Afghanistan. Algeria and Mali are one country, as are the Sudans.

It might have even been deliberate, for some reason of graphic design or test difficulty.   And calling some of the discrepancies culturally ""offensive"" is just ludicrous, IMHO, since there's absolutely no reason to think these abstractions were ever intended to be read as a political statement or a serious assertion of territorial boundaries.

ShittyMapPorn,2wx2g6,SirCharlesTupperware,7,Tue Feb 24 07:42:09 2015 UTC,You mean sorta like this?  The reason for blocks/blockishness is that it makes it easier to visually compare the states with each other (as well as to draw the thing in the first place).

Grass on a soccer field is really not a measure of how much a group of people love the game.   While it's true that in the World Cup and richer places the field is grass, it's really not a necessity. A big reason that football is so popular all around the world, including in developing countries, is that all you need to play is a ball and an open area to play.   Grass is  a luxury that much of the world can't afford, and wouldn't bother with even if they could--the game's a lot faster on dirt."

Also, in your original comment you said that US soccer fields are well maintained and hardly used... you kind of proved your own point. If you're not running around on the field all the time, then the grass tends to stay nice a clean. I imagine these fields are used constantly, with no time for the grass to heal itself. Ever seen a football field after a rainy game? Even the NFL can't keep the grass maintained in those conditions.   Why don't you get on a plane and go down there and install a sprinkler system for them?"

There's, like, San Jose too, or is that in New Mexico?  As I said, I really don't know where anything in California is."
ShittyMapPorn,2v4vx4,adanndyboi,12,Sun Feb 8 03:55:18 2015 UTC,"The big cities in California are in two main clusters - Greater LA (18 million people) in the south, and the San Francisco Bay Area (7.5 million) in the ""north"" (although it's south of Washington, DC). Those two regions are about 400 miles apart, both on the coast. There's still about another third of the state north of SF Bay, but apart from Sacramento (state capital, 450k people) there's not much up there but trees, lakes, and mountains.  LA proper is the second-biggest city in the country by population, and by far the biggest by area, and that's not even counting the other cities surrounding it. A lot of well-known place names in California are in greater Los Angeles, especially the ones known for being sunny. Such places include: Hollywood, Riverside, Orange County, Long Beach, Malibu, Beverly Hills. San Diego is also sort of in the neighborhood, about 100 miles south of LA.  Where SoCal is the land of endless sprawl, the Bay Area has more well-defined cities with relatively dense clusters of suburbs between them. The big cities in the Bay Area are San Francisco (west of San Francisco Bay), San Jose (south), and Oakland (east, just across the bridge from SF). Berkeley, Santa Clara, Palo Alto, and Mountain View (Google HQ) are other Bay Area towns you may have heard of."

However, when comparing whole countries, its best to use GDP, which will tell you how much that country can influence bond markets, how much oil they use or how many aircraft carriers they could afford.

Using the definition you provided, killing someone is pretty antithetical to ""having or showing compassion or benevolence"". How is ending someones life not unnecessary pain or misery? If I gave you a lethal injection while you were sleeping is that humane? Perhaps the method of execution is, but the act of deliberately and arbitrarily murdering you is inherently violent and inhumane."
ShittyMapPorn,2st06h,ctr1a1td3l,4,Sun Jan 18 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you look at killing animals. Vegans take the position that killing animals for the benefit of yourself is not humane.

Virtually all farms, even ""free range"" farms, inflict a lot of unnecessary suffering.  I encourage you to do your own research, and you will likely come to the same conclusions."
ShittyMapPorn,2st06h,Party_Wolf,5,Sun Jan 18 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"Well, we do know that. The conditions of factory farms, which the overwhelming majority of meat comes from, are well known.  From wikipedia:   Close confinement systems (cages, crates) or lifetime confinement in indoor sheds Discomfort and injuries caused by inappropriate flooring and housing Restriction or prevention of normal exercise and most of natural foraging or exploratory behaviour Restriction or prevention of natural maternal nesting behaviour Lack of daylight or fresh air and poor air quality in animal sheds Social stress and injuries caused by overcrowding Health problems caused by extreme selective breeding and management for fast growth and high productivity Reduced lifetime (longevity) of breeding animals (dairy cows, breeding sows) Fast-spreading infections encouraged by crowding and stress in intensive conditions[60] Debeaking (beak trimming or shortening) in the poultry and egg industry to avoid pecking in overcrowded quarters[61] Forced and over feeding (by inserting tubes into the throats of ducks) in the production of foie gras[62]    Confinement and overcrowding of animals results in a lack of exercise and natural locomotory behavior, which weakens their bones and muscles. An intensive poultry farm provides the optimum conditions for viral mutation and transmission – thousands of birds crowded together in a closed, warm, and dusty environment is highly conducive to the transmission of a contagious disease. Selecting generations of birds for their faster growth rates and higher meat yields has left birds’ immune systems less able to cope with infections and there is a high degree of genetic uniformity in the population, making the spread of disease more likely.  Confinement and overcrowding of animals' environment presents the risk of contamination of the meat from viruses and bacteria. Feedlot animals reside in crowded conditions and often spend their time standing in their own waste.[64] A dairy farm with 2,500 cows may produce as much waste as a city of 411,000 people, and unlike a city in which human waste ends up at a sewage treatment plant, livestock waste is not treated.  Confining hens and pigs in crates no larger than the animal itself may lead to physical problems such as osteoporosis and joint pain, and psychological problems including boredom, depression, and frustration, as shown by repetitive or self-destructive actions  In an effort to prevent injury leading to infection, their beaks, tails and teeth are removed.[74][75] Many piglets will die of shock after having their teeth and tails removed, because painkilling medicines are not used in these operations."

Since we don't need to eat meat to survive (anymore) raising and killing animals for our pleasure would constitute unnecessary pain and misery."

We knew it had rings and all that, but didn't have any high quality enough pictures of it so they didn't know how to make it look for the film.

ShittyMapPorn,2rj4se,romulusnr,1 point,Wed Jan 7 03:04:43 2015 UTC,It's shitty mainly because it goes too deep. If it stayed at top level divisions (blue) it would be fine.  I never quite followed why the U.S. was the only part of the typical world map that had it's top level divisions differentiated when so many other countries have them as well.
ShittyMapPorn,2rj4se,Antwelm,2,Fri Jan 9 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"Well I meant that I thought it was really interesting because it goes so deep.  If it was a really high resolution then it would probably work.    Hmm that's a good point, maybe its because the states have more power than provinces?  In the early days of the US, the states were thought of more like individual countries (which is what ""state"" actually means but I digress) so that could be why."
ShittyMapPorn,2rj4se,anditsonfire,2,Fri Jan 9 03:14:07 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking though that was really only true for a few years between 1778 and 1789.  In Canada, provinces are quite similar to states in terms of their amount of home rule, and in some senses perhaps even more powerful over their own domain than U.S. states, in that they have nullification powers."

An alternative is to use approximate Voronoi diagrams, where the Voronoi cells have a fuzzy boundary, which can be approximated.    This is what an approximate Voronoi diagram looks like.

How else could you explain the recent Ebola scare that kept two children who had moved from Rwanda to New Jersey from attending school, despite the fact the East African country is Ebola-free (and further from West Africa than New Jersey is to Texas)? Or the resignation of a teacher in Kentucky due to a backlash to her traveling to Kenya? Or the significant cancellation of tourist trips to places like Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa?  These countries are nowhere near the West African countries where Ebola is actually a problem. Frustrated by this, Anthony England, a British chemist who earned a doctorate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has spent a significant amount of time in sub-Saharan Africa, decided to make a map to help explain what countries currently have Ebola cases and which don't.

ShittyMapPorn,2kcsag,sadfister,17,Sun Oct 26 17:35:27 2014 UTC,"So this is a map of the different ""beats"" that legal reporters from Westlaw may be assigned to.  This is a company that is responsible for reporting on court cases. No matter what beat you're on, most of your work is going to be near the big cities on the coasts. For example, a reporter on the ""Pacific"" beat is going to have most of their time spent in LA, SF, Denver, Seattle, Phoenix, Vegas, Salt Lake, in loosely that order.  The inner portion of the country is going to be mostly arbitrary. You don't hear about a lot of major court cases coming out of OKC, or Nashville, or Wichita, or Omaha. They then divvy those areas among the beats, in terms of how much each state is going contribute to a beat's workload. Since Kansas and Oklahoma are not going to add a whole lot to a Pacific beat Westlaw reporter's workload, they get thrown in to Pacific. Meanwhile, Texas would add way too much, so it gets its own region. But Texas on it's own isn't going to provide as much legal activity as the other beats, so some states are added to from the ones left over after the high-workload states have already been allocated.  TL;DR: This isn't a cultural map, it's a map of dividing workloads evenly among national law reporters."

That's why Madagascar is listed as 9,653,353. Out of countries with less than 10 million head of cattle, it has the most.

Evidence of geomagnetic reversals can be seen at mid-ocean ridges where tectonic plates move apart and the seabed is filled in with magma. As the magma seeps out of the mantle the magnetic particles contained within it are oriented in the direction of the magnetic field at the time the magma cools and solidifies.[19]"

Wat natuurlijk onzin is, want dit is een Amerikaanse website. Een van de dingen waar ze over zeiken is dat bij alle kaarten enzo de data altijd zo gedraaid en geschroefd wordt dat Amerika een kutland lijkt; bijvoorbeeld kijken naar Welvaart door te kijken wat educatie kost, wat in Amerika heel hoog is, maar op zich niks met welvaart te maken heeft. Dus dan lijkt het alsof Amerika een kutland is. Dat wordt bedoeld met onderrepresentatie of overrepresentatie (als het iets negatiefs is, zoals aantal wapendoden).   Als grap heb ik dus een kaartje gemaakt met ieder land van rood naar groen over hoe ondergerepresenteerd Amerika in die landen is. De grap is dat Amerika helemaal niet gerepresenteerd is op deze kaart; helemaal overgeslagen. Dat is dus bijzonder ondergerepresenteerd.  Maar ja, omdat ik Nederlands ben, ben ik er dus schuldig aan dat ik Amerika niet goed neerzet op kaarten. Oftewel, Nederland krijgt een rood kleurtje. Met n = 1 wordt bedoeld hoe groot de testgroep is. n = 1 is een testgroep van 1 persoon, en normaal gesproken dus best wel not done (alsof je naar Duitsland gaat, vraagt aan iemand wat hij van Nederlanders vind, en dan zegt; Ik sprak iemand die niet van Nederlanders houdt, dus Duitsers hebben een hekel aan Nederlanders). Maar dit is een grap, dus hier mag het."

ShittyMapPorn,2j97ks,BelugaBoy,3,Tue Oct 14 22:11:39 2014 UTC,"This is actually more automobile traffic efficient than grid patterned streets, as fewer wider arterial roads are far simpler to coordinate lights and lanes on than a larger grid of square crossed through-ways. Although it is true what the article says about pedestrian and bike traffic."
ShittyMapPorn,2j97ks,PuddleOfMud,3,Tue Oct 14 22:46:42 2014 UTC,"It depends what you mean by ""efficient."" It certainly isn't efficient for traffic, as cars are funneled into few roads and forced to travel indirect routes.  If you look at this map, the entire stretch from ""A"" to the intersection of Golfway Blvd & Woodbury Road only have one exit from their neighborhood."
ShittyMapPorn,2j97ks,benadreti,2,Tue Oct 14 23:44:45 2014 UTC,"Ah yes. It does take longer to leave the neighborhood, and short trips may take longer. I mean efficient from the perspective of commuting halfway across town. When traffic is funneled to just a few thoroughfares, those roads can be designed for a high flow of traffic, with many lanes, few lights, and high speed limits. Whereas in grid-like road networks, there are more intersections, and the lanes are divided among many roads, so each individual road is more narrow and usually needs a lower speed limit to be safe.  I've lived in both a maze-like thoroughfare based suburbs (similar to the picture), and a grid like suburbs. In the thoroughfare based suburbs, I could drive 5 miles to a shopping center in about 10 minutes. In a grid like suburb, a similar trip would usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes due to additional stoplights and lower speed limits.  Though, when I've been in areas with grid layouts, I usually walk rather than drive anyway, because things tend to closer by in a grid. Grids tend to be better for local neighborhoods, while thoroughfare mazes tend to be better for commuting, I suppose."

Martin Van Buren was ''dutch'' by the same logic that Obama is from Kenya. And according to /u/PancakeRepublic the presidents James Buchanan, Chester Arthur, Wilson and Hoover aren't American either.  And like /u/bluebook13 pointed out. If every president born before 1776 is English then  George Washington  John Adams  Thomas Jefferson  James Madison  James Monroe  John Quincy Adams  Andrew Jackson  William Henry Harrison  Aren't American neither. Therefore the first 9 presidents of the US weren't even American. Plus Obama that makes 14 presidents of the 44 that aren't American. more than 1/4"

I grew up in Mumbai which is like a microcosm of the nation- the locality I lived in was as good as any you can find in a 1st world east Asian country (lived in or been to most of them since, so can confirm). 2-3 km to the west of it were absolute wretched slums, 5 km to the west of that shithole (across a creek on the coast) were people living in settlements and villages straight from the British Raj. On the eastern side were typical 3rd world middle class housing societies... and beyond those, about 6-7 km away were highlands covered in a goddamn conserved tropical forest with tigers and leopards and shit, twice the size of Manhattan, all of it within the municpal boundries of the city. There were also a lot of ruins and cave art made by the Portuguese 400 years ago, Hindus in the 8th century AD and Buddhists  ~1st century BC in and around the area.   You could ride a bicycle from one extreme to the other in 2 hours or so, taking in all the sights and feel like you've been to mutiple countries."

ShittyMapPorn,2hcwm4,dashenyang,1 point,Mon Oct 13 13:06:22 2014 UTC,"Yes, which doesn't actually corroborate anything you were saying, of course. The only thing that comes even close is this claim that some governors under the Yuan dynasty were Muslim, the single source for which is a 13th century Persian historian who never went to China in his life, and you know (I'd hope?) how unreliable medieval authors were especially when reporting about areas they'd never come close to personally.   ""Genghis Khan, and the following Yuan Emperors forbade Islamic practices like Halal butchering, forcing Mongol methods of butchering animals on Muslims, and other restrictive degrees continued. Muslims had to slaughter sheep in secret.[17] Genghis Khan directly called Muslims and Jews ""slaves"", and demanded that they follow the Mongol method of eating rather than the halal method. Circumcision was also forbidden. Jews were also affected, and forbidden by the Mongols to eat Kosher.[18][19] Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim Generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim Generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had the name in Chinese which meant ""barracks"" and also mean ""thanks"", many Hui Muslims claim it is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was named in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them.[20]""  Yeah, sure sounds like they accepted Islam into their lifes."
ShittyMapPorn,2hcwm4,270-,1 point,Mon Oct 13 13:18:01 2014 UTC,"Genghis Khan wasn't the one who supported it.  It was those who followed after his death.  Kublai especially.  In the Yuan Dynasty section, Kublai had 8 of the 12 district governors were Muslim, and the Muslim population in China was 4 million in the 14th century.  Islam flourished in China during the Yuan.  Genghis was dead before the Yuan started, so I don't know why the article makes it seem like he was alive during that time.  The Mongols of the early Yuan brought many Muslim scholars to China, and also adopted many war machines that they had encountered in their battles with Muslims in the west.  Sure, persecution began later, but it was the Mongols who brought a lot of it in.  Zheng He, in the Ming, was Chinese and spread Islam to SE Asia."

ShittyMapPorn,1wfl55,AnB85,15,Thu Jan 30 07:20:29 2014 UTC,"Okay.  According to this organization headed by a person summoned to work by a dream,    Christians in a rural area of  Columbia live in fear of guerrilla militants who have banned worship services. Things have grown steadily worse since July and an estimated 150 churches have been closed since then.    &   As Christians are victimized by violent acts of persecution at the hands of armed rebels, in the politically charged climate of Colombia; the future does not look good for one of the most vulnerable groups in the country.   &    Communist rebels in Colombia purge their own ranks of men secretly converted to Christianity.   Source  No mention is made, of course, that    more than 95% of the population adheres to Christianity, the vast majority of which (between 81% and 90%) are Roman Catholic;    or that   While Colombia remains a mostly Roman Catholic country by baptism numbers, the 1991 Colombian constitution guarantees freedom and equality of religion   Source"

ShittyMapPorn,1wfl55,MOAR_cake,6,Sun Jul 6 12:03:55 2014 UTC,Ethiopia? Really?   And what the hell do they think is going on in Kazakhstan?
ShittyMapPorn,1wfl55,iwsfutcmd,2,Sat Apr 5 16:41:24 2014 UTC,I've seen this map hung up outside churches several times. Where exactly are the getting their data from? I know there aren't a ton of Christians in China but is it really so rough for those that live there?
ShittyMapPorn,1wfl55,brebun,6,Thu Jan 30 00:27:01 2014 UTC,In China its tough if you aren't part of a state sanctioned church. But I find it hard to believe that Colombia is as severe as Egypt. Seems a bit hyperbolic.
ShittyMapPorn,1wfl55,jmartkdr,2,Thu Jan 30 00:59:49 2014 UTC,"Egypt isn't, or at least wasn't until recently, very hard on Christians most of the time. They're not a small minority there, though the country is officially Islamic.  source: Egyptian Coptic co-worker."
