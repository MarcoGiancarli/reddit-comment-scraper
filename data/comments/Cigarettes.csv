Cigarettes,3e4n2a,marho,3,Tue Jul 21 22:39:45 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that american cigarettes are generally way stronger than any other ones. That includes marlboro reds. I've never had the Mexican marlboros but if it's not from the us, it's probably way weaker than what you're used to in SoCal.  American spirits are good and really strong, but they're also expensive. The main draw to them is that they last forever (you can make one cig last like 15 minutes if you want) and they have no additives. Try the perique pack (black) or the regular full flavors (light blue I think?). Also the US reds should still be pretty damn strong. You could try those out again."

Cigarettes,3e4n2a,fatgirlchaser69,5,Wed Jul 22 00:05:58 2015 UTC,"OK man, prepare to get your mind blown:  There's a theory out there that states that the act of crying opens up the lungs and relieves the body of stress hormones.  When a person is under severe stress, his/her body engages in ""survival"" mode, where he/she is less affected by either positive or negative physical stimuli (nicotine, pain, disease).  So that's why you don't feel the cigarette's hit, as your lungs' reception is obstructed in order to favor your body's survival.  I'm in the same boat, so that's how I know. I've had severe PTSD for more than two years now. Cigarettes don't do ANYTHING for me."

I'd say look for what makes sense for you. Personally I don't like flashy cases (so plain silver), and I don't smoke that much in a day (so a smaller case, not many cigarettes fit). If you smoke a lot, get a larger case (maybe one you can just slide your pack info), maybe get a design of something you like, and so on. Just like different people have different tastes in cigarettes, different people will have different tastes in cases.  I'd suggest you check around on Amazon or eBay for something, or check out your local smoke shops. Even though it's not an extremely expensive item, shop around a bit and see what's out there."

As far as I know most people leave it on for some reason or another, but I just do it out of laziness. At first I hated it because I love pack designs; I wanted to see the designs in all their glory. So the first pack I ever bought (marb 27's, I think it's ironic because marlboro packaging is very streamlined and simple) I took all of the cellophane off. But after that I just kind of stopped bothering to do it and ever since then I've just kept the bottom cellophane on.  But enough about that. OP, that looks amazing. It was 96 degrees here today, nearly 40% humidity. I take lots of breaks from smoking to keep myself from becoming addicted/to keep getting enjoyment out of every cig but sometimes the breaks are hard to maintain. I know in this heat I'd make a beeline straight for marlboro smooths, which I'm desperately trying to save from trying until december since I heard they taste like candy canes. Enjoy those menthols!
