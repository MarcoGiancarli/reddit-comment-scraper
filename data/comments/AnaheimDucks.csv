AnaheimDucks,3e4pwz,Cacawbirds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:09:55 2015 UTC,Hah! I was going to do this too 8(
AnaheimDucks,3e4pwz,WhiskyTango3,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:20:45 2015 UTC,Mine. Picked all three up at the team store. The Beauchemin stick is signed by Lindholm for some reason.
AnaheimDucks,3e551d,bigben929,4,Wed Jul 22 01:03:46 2015 UTC,He's going to have a big role on the San Diego Gulls this season.
AnaheimDucks,3e551d,thesuperbro,3,Wed Jul 22 01:47:30 2015 UTC,He's got Theodore and Manson in front of him and we already have a pretty solid 6 in front of them.   So not likely.
AnaheimDucks,3e551d,IFightClouds,2,Wed Jul 22 01:18:14 2015 UTC,Thank you both!
AnaheimDucks,3e551d,Todrick,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:22:47 2015 UTC,Somewhere between slim and none.  We're too deep.
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,ElliottWaits,6,Tue Jul 21 20:36:09 2015 UTC,"Kariya - Getzlaf - Selanne  Kunitz - Rucchin - Perry  Lupul - McDonald - Ryan  McInnis - Federov - Kesler(you're a winger now. Figure it out.)  Niedermayer - Pronger  Salei - Beauchemin  Tverdovsky - Visnovsky  Giguere  Hebert  This probably isn't perfect, but it's the best I could come up with in a rush before heading to the gym."
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,adiabolicidiot,9,Tue Jul 21 21:22:15 2015 UTC,I would switch Getzlaf and Rucchin because nostalgia/chemistry.   That Tverdovsky pick doe.
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,sweetwattah,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:25 2015 UTC,Plus you have the line chemistry on the first line and then you keep the twins together!
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,WuTangWizard,5,Tue Jul 21 21:38:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had thought about that too, but then again I just really wanted to imagine what it would be like to see Getzy playing between prime Kariya and Selanne."
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,aerospace_engineer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:43:00 2015 UTC,"I love Rucchin, he was one of the first players I've ever loved, but man he would get eaten up as a 1C"
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,adiabolicidiot,3,Tue Jul 21 22:04:37 2015 UTC,"Kunitz never really became relevant until he went to the pens. I'd probably put freddy over Hebert, and you gotta put parros on the 4th line, cause fuck it."
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,sweetwattah,2,Tue Jul 21 21:32:33 2015 UTC,Haha I was definitely considering throwing Parros on the 4th line. You gotta have that duster on the team.
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,okaywhatnowred,3,Tue Jul 21 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yes to Parros, no to Freddy. Not yet."
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,Thenarek,2,Tue Jul 21 21:48:57 2015 UTC,"Hebert is an anomaly. His numbers were a lot better than his W/L record, but it is cool to see Freddy ""Fuck You"" there on nickname alone."
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,fsbassister,3,Tue Jul 21 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"Where's Moen-Pahlsson-Niedermayer? That would be my fourth line, because we're not claiming anyone who's on the fourth line you have.  Also Visnovsky played like what a year with us? I feel someone like Vishnevsky would be a more appropriate choice"
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,Thenarek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:05:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Visnovsky is kind of more of a King, but he did put up 50 assists for us in 2011."
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,yankeeken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:36:10 2015 UTC,I was wondering the same thing. That was one of the most solid checking lines we've had.
AnaheimDucks,3e45rk,Thenarek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"I was just trying to put together the most talented roster, not the most practical."
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,tynman777,5,Mon Jul 20 20:22:44 2015 UTC,"I think he is done for the most part. I have been vocal on this sub that I don't think we did enough. I look at our roster now compared to the end of the season and I see generally the same level of talent. I won't go over all the ins and outs again but even if you think our roster is better today you could only argue it was very slightly better.   Once again my contention is that we were the 2nd best team in hockey last year. The first best team was significantly weakened IMO. I think we should have added a big proven piece. I think we should have developed a strength (be it offense, defense or special teams) that we do better than any other team. When I see how much Phil Kessel went for, how much dougie Hamilton went for (although that may have been Boston messing that up), the fact that as you mentioned okposo is available, this angers me as a fan. Even signing a guy like Michael frolik who would have instantly upgraded our special teams would have made me happy.   The general response I get to this is ""But we absolutely must resign every single rfa next year!"" I just don't agree with this philosophy. I am of the opinion that when you are on the doorstep, you kick the fucking door down. You go for it all this year, win the cup, and sort it out later. They're Rfas after all, they are very tradeable assets and we have prospects ready in the minors. /rant"
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,4niner,3,Mon Jul 20 20:46:59 2015 UTC,"You are short-sighted if you thought Kessel was worth the asking price. He would have crippled this team financially for years to come. Next year is gonna be a clusterfuck for signings. Add dougie hamilton into it? Same thing. Who are you willing to dump for him? At least two of our beloved youngsters on the blue end would have been gone.   And if you honestly believe this team isn't better than last year's team, your opinion isn't worth much. Stewart is better than Beleskey, Hagelin is better than etem, horcoff is better than thompson. Bieksa is better than Beauchemin. palmieri didn't have a direct replacement but someone will step up in his place.  And let's not forget another year for all the young players who will play better. What if Silf has finally hit his stride and matches his playoff output?   That last paragraph really drives home how limited your hockey knowledge is though so I dunno why I am bothering"
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,74three1989,2,Tue Jul 21 14:16:33 2015 UTC,"Kessel went for a very reasonable package and had part of his salary retained. He's a 40 goal scorer playing with Kesler. You're telling me that wouldn't help us? As for Hamilton, absolutely hard decisions would have to be made but he would be our best defenseman. Maybe we don't trade for Bieksa and extend him until he's ancient.   Stewart is better than Beleskey,   Very marginally in my opinion. This is a guy who has had attitude problems in the past. He certainly wasn't a playoff performer with the blues either.  Hagelin I am excited about, but look up his playoff stats, they don't exactly set the world on fire.  Bieksa better than beauchemin? I think this is a wash. Bieksa is a very different player obviously, but beauchemin was very underrated for our team the last few years. Ya he had a Terrible series against the Hawks but bieksa had a far worse series against the flames.  The last paragraph shows how stupid I am huh. Ok well since I am talking to grand master explain this to me: let's say we extend every single rfa next year. When does Shea Theodore get to play? How about Montour? Manson? Ritchie? Are they just waiting in the minors until they're 25? How do we keep both Andersen and Gibson? Who gets paid more? Isn't Kesler's contract theoretically handicapping us financially for years to come? The point is there are going to be hard decisions that have to be made regardless. If Chicago, LA, Boston, DET, Pitt etc. had the team we have and the cap room we have you can bet your ass they would have made a big move. We could have the best roster in the league hands down. I know we're not cap teams like them, but as a fan I can't help but wish we were."
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,4niner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see at least two of the RFAs getting traded rather than re-signed. It would be nice to use that as a tool at the deadline, as crushing as it would be to lose any of those guys.   I'd rather watch 20-30 games before judging our lineup too much though."
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,SpacedDeep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:29 2015 UTC,don't get me wrong I still think we have an excellent team. But when you compare our cap space with the other semi-finalists we have a huge amount.  Obviously I'm a ducks fan so I hope I'm wrong and that GMBM is making the right moves.
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,4niner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the fact that a few prospects are sure to become every day guys. There's nothing quite like adding talent from your own system. With Ritchie and Theodore sure to have a legitimate shot at a roster spot this year, we shouldn't assume this team isn't better because we didn't go after players with contracts that would handcuff GMBM.  And I for one am not a fan of ""kicking the door down"" for a win now mentality. The Philadelphia Flyers did that and had to trade valuable prospects, depleting their prospect pool, because they were unable to resign them. They've been rebuilding for the past 3 years and look to remain in it for the next 2 years."
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,Shabotly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:29 2015 UTC,The Philadelphia Flyers did that and had to trade valuable prospects   True. I would also argue that the Blackhawks and kings did that as well though.
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,4niner,4,Tue Jul 21 00:42:35 2015 UTC,"Once Silfverberg and Hagelin are signed, We'll be at 49/50 contracts. Safe to say we're done."
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,Johnnystan69,3,Mon Jul 20 21:42:07 2015 UTC,"We had the skill level to win last season we just choked in that game 7 again, I don't think that had anything to do with skill. I think we will definitely be a shot this year again."
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,SixxSwiggs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:48:41 2015 UTC,"no more trades are going to happen. our forward core is fine, and unless a #1 Dman becomes available (hint: there won't be) our defense core isn't changing."
AnaheimDucks,3dzk13,dracomaster01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:03 2015 UTC,He's most likely done making moves. He's going to focus on retaining all of our RFAs.
AnaheimDucks,3dwiyx,JustinIsCool,3,Mon Jul 20 03:03:44 2015 UTC,"We signed Chris Mueller so I guess that replaces his production for the Gulls this season. Unfortunate our center depth (prospect wise) had to take another blow, but he did have a pretty bad defensive season last year for Norfolk."
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,EtemAll,32,Sun Jul 19 06:16:23 2015 UTC,I thought it was agreed upon that our series was the real Stanley Cup Finals. The whole East vs West thing was just customary.  Edit: /s just a joke guys.
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,DBacon1052,8,Sun Jul 19 08:29:57 2015 UTC,"This. I was there for game 6, my first ever game i went to. was waaaaay more intense than any moment in the finals."
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,Loki364,5,Sun Jul 19 16:06:20 2015 UTC,"That says a lot, because I'm pretty sure our boys stopped playing after Beleskey's goal in Game 5"
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,sweetwattah,2,Sun Jul 19 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"I don't wanna talk about that game. Worst sporting event experience I've ever had.   Edit: worse than staples, by far."
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,KershawsBabyMama,2,Sun Jul 19 19:19:42 2015 UTC,What happened?
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,Latentk,2,Sun Jul 19 21:30:50 2015 UTC,"People around us yelling in mine and my friends' faces when they scored, guys turning around and taking snapchats of us after they scored a goal, smacking me in the face with their rally towel, throwing random shit at us, offensive name calling. I have pretty thick skin but going through that for over 3 hours was almost too much for me.   In case there is doubt to whether any of it was warranted, I can assure you it was not. There was nothing to fucking cheer for or be a pompous ass in the first place!!! ... Which was probably the worst part of it all :( I can handle a two way road trash talk all in good fun night, even with a loss. But not that. Fuck.   Actually, no. The worst part is that my gf is a bandwagon Hawks fan (I'm from LA/OC, moved to Chicago 3 years ago).   Fuck my life."
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,KershawsBabyMama,4,Mon Jul 20 08:08:17 2015 UTC,Break up with her and move back.
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,noroadsleft,2,Mon Jul 20 08:14:30 2015 UTC,My hawks fan bosses pay me really good money otherwise I'd be back next week.
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,KershawsBabyMama,2,Mon Jul 20 09:20:56 2015 UTC,Break up with her and stay there.
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,noroadsleft,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:31:58 2015 UTC,"Damn man, sorry to hear that. The Madhouse isn't even one of the more rowdy stadiums or so I have heard. I have not yet been to either the Ponda or The Madhouse but perhaps one day. It sucks things have to get so hostile like that. It'd been better had a single Hawks fan tried to regulate the amount of shit they were flinging your way.   From what I hear the Pond can be just as bad just depending on which Cholos decide to show up and just how many Kings fans decide to troll. The best story I heard was of the dude who sucker punched a dad in the back of the head at the Pond that was chased down and was equally shit on by a few Ducks fans who watched it go down.   Hockey brings out the best and the worst of people. Also, get out of Chicago, bro!"
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,Latentk,3,Mon Jul 20 14:58:45 2015 UTC,I was at game 4...best and worst at the same time

AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,Firebitez,11,Sun Jul 19 07:19:35 2015 UTC,The most important take away I got was when Toews commented that we were such a tough team in goaltending. Kinda an awesome thing to hear from a player and leader of his caliber. Added some external validation for me that Freddy is a heck of a goaltender.
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,Reanimated_Nerd,5,Sun Jul 19 15:36:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was nice of him to say."
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,thesuperbro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:46:37 2015 UTC,Idk about that. 19 GA in the last 4 of the series. Yeeesh.
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,tnt6656,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:00:13 2015 UTC,But the Hawks did that to every goaltender
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,FuntCision,9,Mon Jul 20 21:52:53 2015 UTC,"To all that keep commentating how this is super obvious, i know, but its nice to hear from the guy say it, as well as some teamates saying its the toughest hockey they've played, it feels good to get respect."
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,meatboitantan,2,Sun Jul 19 20:22:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, sorry guys. How silly of him to post something in the Anaheim Ducks subreddit pertaining to the Ducks. How dare we keep it active during the offseason with news that actually is pretty cool to hear.   I thought this was a cool thing to share. Don't listen to the jerks."
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,albinogoron,15,Mon Jul 20 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems like everyone forgot that Tampa Bay wasn't at its best during the Stanley Cup Finals. Tyler Johnson had a broken wrist and bishop had poo poo problems. But yeah, it was obvious we gave them a harder fight than Tampa, and frankly that's gonna be Chicago's last cup if their off-season continues to be this bad."
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,MonkeyWithMachete,11,Sun Jul 19 09:33:57 2015 UTC,"I feel, in the deepest of my heart, that it is the Ducks year this year. No bloviating. No typical hard core fan saying cliche shit. I'm telling you. 2016 Stanley Cup champs:Anaheim Ducks. If anybody wants to take me up on this we can figure something out. This season it's us."
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,atheistpiece,8,Sun Jul 19 12:49:48 2015 UTC,"I'm going to Vegas next month and I'm putting down a futures bet. The odds are 10/1 right now, so I figure I'll make a $100 bet and next year in June my investment will turn into a nice Catalina vacation."

AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,MonkeyWithMachete,5,Sun Jul 19 13:39:05 2015 UTC,Look at you... ugh...
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,batRam,3,Sun Jul 19 13:42:53 2015 UTC,"even if we were to win in 2017, a game 7 loss in the finals next year would DESTROY me"

AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,Demilict,-14,Sun Jul 19 21:16:27 2015 UTC,Hey that's really nice but you're missing a solid d group to take you there. Problem is your defense needs a few more years of experience and that window is closing
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,Shabotly,9,Sun Jul 19 14:44:56 2015 UTC,Our window is closing for our defensemen to get more experience? Sounds logical........
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,Demilict,-5,Sun Jul 19 16:10:55 2015 UTC,Troll harder. You know I meant your playoff window. Unless you think the ducks will still be in the WCF 3 to 4 years from now
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,Shabotly,9,Sun Jul 19 19:22:56 2015 UTC,No I didn't know what you meant since you refused to put together a coherent thought.
AnaheimDucks,3dta2c,Veranique,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:35:45 2015 UTC,"So, the Kings have a pretty great defensive line - what was the excuse for not making it to the playoffs?"

Theyve been out of the mediums of the whites for a few months now.  its seriously frustrating because none of the shops that actually stitch their player kits seem to be able to get consistent access to the aways.  i dont get it.  every other team seems to have plentiful stock - except us.
AnaheimDucks,3dufcq,Thepickleweed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:49 2015 UTC,I am a medium as well. And some players had Medium and some didn't. Worth a shot.
AnaheimDucks,3dufcq,Thepickleweed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:15:15 2015 UTC,some of them are the old 3rds too.  just something to be aware of edit:  just chatted with them.  those were old photos that needed to be updated.  so there are a few M's around for certain guys in the homes.  the aways are still picked clean
AnaheimDucks,3dvio9,trippymane9,4,Sun Jul 19 21:44:39 2015 UTC,I've seen him get lit up in the ECHL a few times. He's proof that just being gigantic doesn't make a person an amazing goalie.
AnaheimDucks,3dvio9,Bryseroni,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:51 2015 UTC,At one time he was actually really good.  He was named best goalie at the U18 world championships.   I don't know what happened.
AnaheimDucks,3dvio9,IFightClouds,2,Mon Jul 20 01:04:54 2015 UTC,Maybe he just couldn't keep up with the rise in competition.
AnaheimDucks,3dvio9,Bryseroni,3,Mon Jul 20 01:08:00 2015 UTC,Yea probably.   I think a lot of those naturally gifted physical monsters just coast on their size and athleticism and don't put the work in that's required at the higher levels.   You see that a lot with top college football guys going to the NFL.
AnaheimDucks,3dvio9,IFightClouds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:11:28 2015 UTC,or guys who make it in the nfl then get a huge pay day and stop working...aka haynesworth (spell check) and chris johnson
AnaheimDucks,3dvio9,muldin,4,Mon Jul 20 01:41:28 2015 UTC,Yes he's done.  We didn't tender a RFA contract so he's a UFA now.

AnaheimDucks,3dsj18,MonkeyWithMachete,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:40:33 2015 UTC,I think having Ritchie and Theodore so close in San Diego is going to be great for player development. I think Ritchie can play LW for any line on the big club.

AnaheimDucks,3doh9e,ashtonstine,2,Sun Jul 19 16:35:14 2015 UTC,Ahem /u/coolhockey.... lol
AnaheimDucks,3doh9e,justanotherotaku,3,Sat Jul 18 00:19:56 2015 UTC,"As a noob to coolhockey, what is the quality like? Is it comparable to jerseys bought on Chinese sites where the coloring and stitching is shotty at best, or is it closer to team store quality (obviously not expecting perfection)?"
AnaheimDucks,3doh9e,ashtonstine,5,Sat Jul 18 05:08:18 2015 UTC,"All of /r/hockeyjerseys loves coolhockey as a reputable place with good quality, even better than ordering from nhl itself because the kits are actually sewn on rather than pressed. If you have any questions you can actually ask /u/coolhockey as well!"
AnaheimDucks,3doh9e,smokeey,4,Sat Jul 18 05:43:09 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I thank you for sharing. My wallet doesn't thank you, but my heart does."
AnaheimDucks,3doh9e,Aceoangels,2,Sat Jul 18 07:45:12 2015 UTC,"Never ordered from them but have heard awesome things about them from /r/hockeyjerseys. They are definitely not Chinese site knockoffs and they actually stitch on lettering/numbers as opposed to heat pressing like the team store. PM /u/coolhockey for more substantive questions, they answer lots of questions through reddit."
AnaheimDucks,3doh9e,amper,2,Sat Jul 18 14:31:31 2015 UTC,Jersey quality is the exact same as the team store or NHL.com  Stitching quality is great. Ordered 2 jerseys from them and couldn't ask for better.

Surprise, she's a Kes fan too and I ordered one of our home darks in #17... Looking forward to the /u/coolhockey quality that I've heard about."

AnaheimDucks,3doh9e,Gionta1222,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:48:05 2015 UTC,Oh I know... I pulled the trigger on a large since I don't mind the slight difference. Plus $125 for a Kesbae sweater? Can't beat that!

AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,sweetwattah,25,Thu Jul 16 21:44:16 2015 UTC,Ouch. Hurts even more because it's true...
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,sweetwattah,11,Thu Jul 16 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"I will be the happiest guy on this sub when we get back to the Cup, but as of right now this rhetoric is just rhetoric to me. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times...?"
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,bmiller85,25,Thu Jul 16 22:00:15 2015 UTC,Three times and we become the like the Sharks
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,dodgerblue1212,4,Thu Jul 16 22:33:09 2015 UTC,Kind of... they've never won a cup.
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,bm97,3,Fri Jul 17 03:39:56 2015 UTC,"Ya, but they were Western Conference Regular Season Champs once"
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,dracomaster01,6,Fri Jul 17 10:52:45 2015 UTC,"-Ryan Getzlaf, Saku Koivu, and Teemu Selanne, June 2013"
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,dracomaster01,21,Fri Jul 17 07:12:16 2015 UTC,"To me, this has to be our year. It's most likely our last year that our defensive core will stay with these players, and Getz/Perry/Kesler will still be elite players, instead of just really good.  I hope after another bad loss, the team will get that killer instinct Kesler was talking about, because that's really all this team needs to go all the way."
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,sweetwattah,13,Thu Jul 16 21:25:06 2015 UTC,"I dunno...  I still think a top-tier defensemen is still the x-factor we are missing.  Our defense is still a bit inexperienced and/or past their prime.  We still have a few good years from our elite forwards too.  But, goddamn, we are running out of excuses!  There will never be a perfect team that can automatically win the cup.  It takes the perfect combination of gelling, getting hot, and confidence to bring home the cup."
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,Slappamedoo,11,Thu Jul 16 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that, but we have to stop thinking we can get a top-tier defensemen anymore. If we want one, it's gonna have to be one that's already in our system; Lindholm, Fowler, Vats, or Despres."
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,Fowlin4you,3,Thu Jul 16 21:53:48 2015 UTC,Good thought. I would love for this to be the year one of our young d-men breaks out and earns the right to be called elite.
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,Slappamedoo,3,Thu Jul 16 21:57:15 2015 UTC,It's gonna be Lindholm. Fowler has fallen off that trajectory.
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,Fowlin4you,12,Thu Jul 16 21:56:23 2015 UTC,"He's what 22, 23? He hasn't even hit his prime yet. He looked great in the playoffs."
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,Slappamedoo,0,Thu Jul 16 21:59:47 2015 UTC,Minus game 7 of the WCF...
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,TheBlueEagle,15,Thu Jul 16 22:12:08 2015 UTC,One bad game doesn't preclude you from having top pairing potential
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,EddieEh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:10 2015 UTC,"Fowler was our top pair guy for years but he's been outshined by Lindholm, with good reason."
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,KershawsBabyMama,2,Sat Jul 18 00:03:33 2015 UTC,"That doesn't mean Fowler can't deliver top pairing quality defense and puck movement. Even if Lindholm ends up our number one and he doesn't play on the same pairing with Cam, that doesn't make Cam any worse of a player. Niedermayer and Pronger rarely shared the same ice together, but they were both easily number 1 defensemen. Not to say I expect these two to reach their legendary heights, but my point is, you can be a great defenseman on a second pairing.   Point is, defensemen hit their prime in their mid to late twenties typically. Same with goalies. Guys like Karlsson, Pietrangelo, Ekblad, etc. they're the exceptions not the rule. Neither Fowler or Lindholm is even close to their best hockey yet."
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,Slappamedoo,9,Sat Jul 18 00:18:24 2015 UTC,Who did look good that game? Minus maybe Kesler.
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,dracomaster01,7,Fri Jul 17 01:14:51 2015 UTC,Fowler was our best defencemen in the playoffs and IMO the best defenceman on the team.
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,EddieEh,2,Thu Jul 16 22:54:15 2015 UTC,"Eh. I don't know. I still think that Lindholm was the strongest defenseman overall last season. However, in the postseason the Depres/Fowler pairing looked really, really strong most of the time."
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,rambleonfreddy,2,Fri Jul 17 08:43:49 2015 UTC,"First half of the year yes, Lindholm was far and away our best defenseman. But Hampus starting trending down around February while Fowler started trending up at the end of that month. Hampus kind of leveled out at what I'd call ""average"" play for him and took that level of play into the playoffs IMO. I really wanted more out of Hampus in the playoffs and he was reliable for the most part but we've all seen him at his best and he didn't show it often in the postseason. Cam on the other hand, especially after getting Despres as a partner, seemed to be back in Olympic form and was clearly our best defenseman in the postseason. If he can bring that same work ethic and reliable defensive play next year I'll be satisfied with him. Hampus I fully expect to smooth out the sophomore kinks and hit a whole new level. His development curve has always been crazy."
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,OnlyBiasedSometimes,2,Sat Jul 18 00:24:57 2015 UTC,"yeah I agree, just wanted to post the guys who have the potential to be that. It's gonna be Lindholm though"
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,sweetwattah,2,Thu Jul 16 21:59:03 2015 UTC,A top defenceman would definitely be a huge piece to add but I don't really see the chance for us to get one. I still think we can win with the group we have now. There may not be superstar back there but it's pretty solid from 1 to 6. And our defence is still very young so expect them to keep improving.
AnaheimDucks,3djtgk,Firebitez,9,Thu Jul 16 23:01:45 2015 UTC,The new sidebar picture is making this sub really hard to look at at work...
