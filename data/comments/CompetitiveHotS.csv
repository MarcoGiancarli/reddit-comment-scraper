He is a good lane bully with his non-heroic bonus damage and his high sustain. Basically he can tank an entire wave plus attacks from enemies to push out the lane and then just sit back and sustain all that life back.  He has high mobility which can be used defensively but also aggressively and it helped me a ton when trying to get out of sticky situations.  I just don't think he has much pressure in teamfights. He has good damage, but he needs CC to stick to targets and his Q is not enough for that. His Entomb can be used to secure 1 or 2 kills which can be good but it can also be easily avoided by heroes with mobility. The only heroes with mobility spells that can't escape Entomb are Valla, Tychus, E.T.C and Kerrigan.  His trait is interesting but I haven't seen anyone using it effectively  so far. It makes it so he can stay in lane practically forever early game so he can soak a lot of experience. However he doesn't get any exp while he is dead."

CompetitiveHotS,3d9oxh,RedRhino671,3,Tue Jul 14 16:22:17 2015 UTC,"As an investor, you're likely going to want to find a team that's already running under some form of online community if you're searching for up and coming since they'd likely already have some form of connections with sponsors that can help the team grow. If you were looking to own a team, then it's a totally different story as you would have to invest in a staff to help the team grow both with sponsors and in competition. This would normally include a marketing manager (for sponsors), a coach/analyst/player manager (to make sure the team you're spending money on is improving and working towards making your money back), and possibly a co-owner who knows the ins and outs of the esports business world (with a preference on Heroes of the Storm experience.)  For new teams, getting sponsored works much how you would imagine it does. You or your marketing manager send out e-mails upon e-mails upon e-mails with your team's numbers, goals, accomplishments and prior experience in competitive gaming to convince organizations that sending free gear/providing some sort of financial investment is good for that company. In League of Legends, professional teams receive a salary from Riot, but Heroes of the Storm is still a bit too new for that, so depending on how good your team is, sponsorships, streaming and tournament winnings are going to be the primary source of funding in this game.   Because this game is so new however, if you find a group of 5 people that you feel confident in, most of the time they'd be thrilled just to be a part of an organization that's looking out for them in providing a staff to help them improve their gameplay and to give them something that they belong to. It's a motivational boost and lets them know that their hard work is starting to pay off so it wouldn't be hard to find a team that would work for you for free, however if you aren't paying salary, individual/team earnings should have a higher percentage go to the team than to you off tournament winnings, streaming revenue, etc. Your marketing manager/co-owner/player manager however might request some form of compensation depending on the amount of time you're expecting them to put in. If you want an analyst/coach working 16 hours a day studying top gameplay and your team's replays, the nice thing to do is to give them some form of payment.  This is the best way I can answer how starting an organization would work for someone that hasn't worked in the industry before.

Also, dont let people tell you tassadar is the perfect counter to him. Did you know that Zeratuls highest win rate is in fact vs. Tassadar? This is because once Zeratul has wormhole, he can be uses to poke as well as finish. It doesnt require as much risk vs. A tassadar as a build without wormhole. Knowing that Zeratul has an abathur means that he will be running closer to you and exposing his shimmer more as opposed to harassing with wormhole"
CompetitiveHotS,3cxzqa,plzpigglywigglyplz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:20:56 2015 UTC,"High CC comps are always safe, especially with a good burst hero or two. As soon as he shows: uther stun, mur stun, and burst down. If you have some good cc heroes already, any burst assassin would be a good pickup. I agree with Jaina being a strong pick. Valla is also really strong vs stealth in my opinion, her Q and W make it easy to reveal and give her strong burst, and her e gives her an escape.  Also, with them having those 2 heroes roaming, their lane presence will be weak, requiring them to have 3 heroes solo laning on a 3 lane map. What I like to do early is have 2 people solo lane, preferably the tank and a range who can safely solo. With that, have the other 3 shove a lane in hard. You can get gates and towers pretty easily this way, and force the zeratul to focus primarily on that lane as well. After you take gates and towers, you can swap the 3-man to another lane to push, as going for the fort that early can be risky.  Other than that, just keep your eyes peeled, and ping him when you see him."

If you're playing competitive games, adjust your ban/pick strategy to not allow them to have it. If you're playing hero league your best bet is to try and pick early game and snowball hard with a fast push tri lane composition. Abathur/zeratul isn't that strong in a straight up fight if they have to 3v3 you in the lane to try and keep their buildings alive."

I love playing range assassins and specialists, but I've found, since I almost exclusively solo queue when playing HL, that I had to broaden my role and hero pool to meet the needs of the team.  To that end, I've gotten to a really high level with tanking, and a reasonably high level with some of the main healers.  I do not play every hero for these roles, but I'm open to getting good at any character in the game to WIN.  I'm all about winning.  Practice hours:  I can play every day except Saturday, from 3pm to 1am.  I'm flexible, but a consistent schedule is really important to me (I think it's an important element to being successful in anything, ESPECIALLY in competition).  Rank: I've been hovering between rank 4 and 7, here's my hotslogs:  https://www.hotslogs.com/Player/Profile?PlayerID=4001754 -  solo queuing is pretty difficult.    Additional Info:  I'm 27.  I'm reliable.  I've been playing games competitively for a LONG time (Brood War, CS1.6, HaloPC, WoW).  I've been at the top of a couple of those games.  I've competed in big tournaments and placed high.  I've experienced winning, I know what it takes to win, and I want to win some more.  Other than that, I live a pretty active lifestyle.  I'm super competitive when its game time, but otherwise I'm pretty easy going.  I don't get angry and yell like a punk ass bitch.  I'm capable of taking criticism and of criticizing constructively without being a cunt.  I expect some or most of these things out of you.  Also, I admire Gregg Popovich.    Get at me."

Rank/link to hotslogs: https://www.hotslogs.com/Player/Profile?PlayerID=2099487  I am forming a competitive team to compete in the weekly esls, heroes hype amateur and the august blizzcon qualifiers. Eventually hoping to qualify for the esl major league, aswell as any other na tournaments that pop up. Here's what i'm looking for.   Be available at least 5 days out of the week to practice/scrim. Still figuring out the exact times but i'd want atleast a bare minimum of 4 hours of practice a session. You must want it bad and be dedicated, i have had teammates who are just passing the time or messing around. If you just want to hero league with friends, don't apply. I want people who will dream of something big like winning blizzcon or the major league and work to achieve it. Someone who isn't forced to practice but wants to. Obviously we're not going to win everything immediately out of the gate. That's why you have to work for it. Attitude, this is one of the biggest things for me. Speak up if you have a issue or a idea, but be able to take criticism. I don't want you to be afraid to disagree with my ideas or decisions because you think you'll be booted or something, however i don't want you to be unable to accept that you could be wrong. No one's a perfect player, not myself or any member of the team. Of course, some things shouldn't be said during the game that may cause arguing, bring it up after. This isn't just game problems, this is people problems too. If you straight up dislike someone on the team then tell them and fix it. Otherwise, resentment will just grow and cause problems.   Have myself and one other locked in. Have a 3rd in mind.  So i'm looking for three players who are atleast Rank 1 and over 3k mmr.   Jingle is a support main.   I can play anything, but i'll likely be looking to fill either the warrior role or a flex role.   That leaves us with the warrior, two flex roles and the assassin role open.

You basically just confirmed why I should be salty...they made me wait a week after providing the notion that I would be tried out day after day.   And what would I be apologizing about? Holding them accountable to wasting hours on hours of my time?"

It's actually slander to say that I'm slandering them as you're creating a conversation about how I purposely went out of my way to destroy these guys. These are backed up claims about a team wasting my time by offering a try out, and then making myself available for a week and wasting a lot of time waiting for that try out (literally stayed in on a night or two to wait for a try out spot). I would've called out any team that held me up in limbo for a week to not even give me a try out after offering it, and THEN blaming me for being the issue because of being upset.  There are many teams out there that have greater respect for players. I have no desire to play on teams like these."

CompetitiveHotS,3cdyww,tehfez,0,Tue Jul 7 13:59:29 2015 UTC,"Not 2k. I won't explain to you the failure of mmr or rank to convey skill because you clearly wouldn't understand with your non-stop childish banter and following me around the forum.   For those that care though, a system like starcraft 2 is a fair representation of your rank/mmr mainly because you're playing as a solo player. You're accountable to your losses. I've heard the argument in that it averages out over time and I'm sure it does, but that's over infinite amount of games."
CompetitiveHotS,3cdyww,TrackRJackR,-3,Tue Jul 7 14:29:33 2015 UTC,MMR in HOTS is perfectly fine and often accurate (Talking about hotslogs here). If you have 1600 games and are low mmr then you probably just are not that great at the game. I played solo to over 3.8k mmr easily. If you have a high game knowledge you can make decisions to allow you to win a majority of your games.

Half the battle of being a journalist or writer is finding content to write about. Start by seeking out those teams or tournaments needing coverage, and just do a piece on them of your own accord.  If you want something to model yourself after, Travis Gafford from the League of Legends scene started out when League was super small. He started out doing a State of the League thing (modeled from a similar deal in the Starcraft scene) where he basically talked to pro players and teams and made a podcast out of it.  Another idea is to find a unique thing that's done in other competitive gaming scenes (LoL, SC2, CS:GO) and put your own twist on it for the HotS scene."

CompetitiveHotS,3bozaz,huntert1220,2,Tue Jun 30 23:43:46 2015 UTC,"there's a lot of potential for growth....  look up heroes of the dorm.  there are already sponsored top teams in eu and na that have established fan bases (i'm not as familiar with the asian scene).  you should play this game and follow it if you like it.  hero league has 50 ranks where each rank is intended to contain roughly 2% of the population.  all of the pro players easily reach rank 1, of course, so they're going to add some sort of grand master type league above rank 1."
CompetitiveHotS,3bozaz,cowvin,2,Wed Jul 1 05:33:14 2015 UTC,"I was also a diamond league player and started playing casual in season 1 and ranked in 2. I have to say at first I hated Heroes now I love it and it is hard to play league which is much slower paced.   However, I do not think it will ever be a LOL huge but that remains to be seen because it takes years to expand into that type of scene. There are already tournaments and there is going to be a big tourny in a few months and the qualifiers are actually going on now.   However, even though the game is ""simplified"" as compared to other mobas it has a depth that is hidden through the champion pool/talents. Blizzards artistic/mechanical/strategic scope in creating characters is amazing. There are already all sorts of comps and it is fun to see them in action. This will only expand with the constant creation of heroes which they have already said will be released at a constant rate of 1 per 3 weeks. Also i love the fact that the maps have differing strengths for example black hearts is a super fast map, meaning you don't want a late game carry in most cases like kael (not that he is bad) but i have seen many games just run over him because he needs time to ramp up.   Also the ranked system is a bit weird in my opinion, because there is a huge difference in ranked 1 standards. I often find myself wondering why people are that high because they just seem to not be mechanically strong."
CompetitiveHotS,3bozaz,smokebaca,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:19:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight? Do you play the ranked mode in HotS and if so how much do you think your league skill attributed to your HotS ability?
CompetitiveHotS,3bozaz,smokebaca,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I play ranked in both because people tend to take the games a bit more seriously instead of experimenting or goofing off like in quick match. Currently I am rank 1 and in master tier on hotslogs and I do attribute this a little bit too league because they are fundamentally the same genre, but I always had horrible ping in league like 80-120, I do not have the same problem in heroes"
CompetitiveHotS,3bmw3v,merkwerk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:36:15 2015 UTC,"Nice video. About the boss fights - a few competitive guides I read say that you should never take a boss when the other team is down or you have the objective (such as curse especially) and instead you should just use that time to push yourself as a team as you will get almost similar benefit for much less risk. However I see many teams try to get the boss right away and I see it sometimes work and sometimes doesn't.  After analyzing this game, what are you thoughts on boss captures? Is it still a good strategy to take right after a team fight/getting tribute as long as it's later in the game (so respawn timers are longer)? Or is it something that you take to counter an objective that the other team almost certainly has over you?"
CompetitiveHotS,3bmw3v,leuthil,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:11:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's really a case by case basis. For instance let's say you have a team fight top and you kill a couple of them and top and mid forts are already down. Well in that case you have to look at how long they are dead for and how close you are to the top keep. If your team is so far that by the time you get to the wall and begin sieging I think it's better in that instance to just back off and take boss. It's not going to down the keep, but it causes the other team to have to leave at least one or two people to clean up the boss so it doesn't get too much free damage. The important part here is using that to your advantage elsewhere on the map, by taking other camps or even rotating to try to steal their boss quickly if you see the majority of their team is staying to clean up boss.   It's interesting that the guides mention to not take boss when you down their team. I understand the logic behind pushing while they are down but a competent team will always contest you trying to take boss unless you have a numbers advantage over them. I'll have to look into that myself.   But yeah during this game I think there were some points where pushing would have been a better play than going for the boss."
CompetitiveHotS,3bmw3v,leuthil,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:28:03 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely case by case basis. I think that's the reason why pushing is recommended over taking boss because it is standard the any team will try to contest you taking boss right away.  Again though it was one or two guides I saw and I don't know how common that type of strategy is.
CompetitiveHotS,3bjn6n,abrAaKaHanK,21,Mon Jun 29 19:37:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. There's a recruitment thread for a reason. As long as it is updated on maybe a weekly basis there should be no reason for individual posts. I'm speaking as someone that only checks this subreddit once a week for top posts with discussion. I have friends to play with and don't need a team, but if I do at some point I'll know where to look.   Edit: I think it would be wise to put categories in the weekly thread. Mods should make parent comments in bold for different categories such as ""casual"" ""HL"" ""Tournaments"" etc.."

While I'd like this subreddit to mirror the success of r/CompetitiveHS, there are a few significant barriers for HOTS that don't exist for Hearthstone.  I'd like to go through them all if I had time!  One kind of post I liked from r/CompetitiveHS was the Legend decklist posts that described an individual's climb to high MMR, his deck strategy vs the META, etc.  Those kinds of posts are much more difficult to come by in HOTS, but it is possible. I've seen for example abathur mains who only played 1 hero through solo queue to Rank 1. Steady standalone content like this is what I'd really like to see from this subreddit. It doesn't necessarily need to be a carbon-copy of the mold from hearthstone's community, but something w/ the same concept of individual experience w/ something very focused that the community can learn from."

CompetitiveHotS,3b29pk,tentacoolz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:07:24 2015 UTC,"This all the way, I do hope that Illidan will be a little less picked and powerful (with good coordination). I would like a day when Sonya is a good hero, but I also agree that it probably wont be this patch.  Saying that Sonya has seen a pretty good winrate increase without any changes made to her as a result of some heroes getting buffed/changed/nerfed."

CompetitiveHotS,3ayznl,essillore,3,Wed Jun 24 17:07:26 2015 UTC,Tempostorm.com is up and coming. I love it. Reynad and his team are solid.  HotsLogs is invaluable.

Reddit: some good tricks and news, but few informations about strategies and pro gaming  Blizzard forum: 90% of threads are NERF THIS / BUFF THIS!!1!  Heroes Nexus: Some builds and guides are nice, but nothing more  Heroes Fire: Same as Heroes Nexus  Team Liquid: top level strategies and guides, but not too many posts  Hotslog: only viable replay database (searchable by heroes), but not well organized  Gousgamers: good replay database (but NOT searchable by heroes, argh!)  Thus, I am missing  a good forum (divided by heroes would be great!) with a lot of info,   an easy to use replay database,  a good strategy site with videos."
CompetitiveHotS,3ayznl,Nablavector,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:54:36 2015 UTC,a good forum that is divided by the hero.   Super smash bros does a great job of this on their forums and I'm going to build this into my site. This was a great idea and really needed. Thank you!
CompetitiveHotS,3ayznl,Skill874,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"I really like watching Khaldors youtube channel.  https://www.youtube.com/user/KhaldorTV He commentates a lot of matches throught the week for various tourneys and often puts the best/most interesting ones on the channel which results in having 1-2 fresh vids everyday with a great commentary that is both entertaining and educating. Ofc at some point you won't learn as much by listening to him, but you then should be able to make your own thoughts about why the pro teams play this particular comp or choose those (uncommon) talents. Especially focusing on the players that play your role is really a great way to get better. Other than that i have to agree with Nablavector - there aren't really awesome sites for guides and such, but i have hopes teamliquid will soon open a full Hots section.

CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,SpongeyStiffRat,2,Wed Jun 24 07:01:16 2015 UTC,The intention is for competitive discussion to be held here. That's why I have a weekly LFT post and the submission text clearly says not to post LFT threads
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,abrAaKaHanK,2,Wed Jun 24 15:02:15 2015 UTC,Looks like it might be time to brandish that ban-hammer

I can't figure out what gives the impression that it's okay, but 75% of posts here are from new people posting them. Most of our good content is posted by a very small group of people who I can only hope will stick around"
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,abrAaKaHanK,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:09:14 2015 UTC,LFT threads are the only thing keeping this sub alive. If there was discussion being clogged up by these threads I could see an issue but there have been 4 posts in the last 3 days. 2 of those are advertising for tournaments (which I would argue contribute to the competitive discussion just as much as recruitment threads). Now I don't want to see those tournament threads gone but the only threads that should be removed are non-related ones including asking for advice and asking for HL teams.
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,FitzyGG,0,Mon Jun 29 15:45:24 2015 UTC,"The stated purpose of this subreddit is discussion. That's what I made it for and that's the service I'm attempting to provide for the community. If people want recruitment they can use the sticky thread or start their own subreddit for that purpose.  To illustrate this point, look how many comments are in the sticky every week. Who would subscribe to a subreddit that spammed their feed with that many threads?"
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,abrAaKaHanK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:37:16 2015 UTC,48 threads a week isn't very many...  On top of that the last post in that thread was 4 days ago.

CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,abrAaKaHanK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:44:33 2015 UTC,You are moderating something for the community not for yourself. If you aren't going to support the community you should get a different mod to do so. It does't matter if you made it or if someone who quit the game has - its a community driven place.
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,FitzyGG,0,Mon Jun 29 19:16:06 2015 UTC,You're assuming you're in the majority and you're not.
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,abrAaKaHanK,0,Mon Jun 29 19:17:37 2015 UTC,Why would your opinion matter - mods are there to support the community. Just because something was created with a different goal in mind doesn't mean it can't serve a desired purpose.
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,Mercylas,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:23:15 2015 UTC,Look at the front page of this sub. Only 10 threads follow this rule. Thats under 50%. Clearly people are coming to this sub for other purposes. 1 Post is this META post and 3 are tournament advertisements. So that leaves us with 6 posts on the front page that follow the service you want.
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,Mercylas,6,Mon Jun 29 18:06:54 2015 UTC,I made this subreddit as a place to discuss the game on a competitive level. However I can only do so much to make that happen. People insist on posting looking for team threads and I can only delete them so often.
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,abrAaKaHanK,5,Wed Jun 24 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to help you develop a strategy akin to /r/CompetitiveHS . They didn't have a plan, but then they developed one, and now it's amazing."
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,tilde_tilde_tilde,2,Wed Jun 24 23:54:28 2015 UTC,Do you have anything specific in mind? You can PM me if you'd like.
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,abrAaKaHanK,0,Mon Jun 29 16:40:01 2015 UTC,I think this is worth doing for sure. It feels like one of the only ways to improve in the game at higher levels is to do scrims with other players of equal or higher skill since the matchmaking isn't reliable at all for producing high quality matches.  There needs to be some kind of vehicle for this and Blizzard hasn't released clan support yet (not that it would replace the use of a forum anyway).  I think the initial strategy that makes sense is moderation (to just clean up the LFG posts) and the producing some regular content to drive more traffic / focus on competitive HotS. Most guides are posted on /r/hots directly so people end up going there for the one stop shop instead of being directed as a crosspost.
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,tiger_ace,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"Can I suggest that you limit team recruitment to the weekly megathead? I see that you're already doing that, but it needs to be more heavily enforced if people are going to adhere to it.

I feel like most of the community would be on your side (seeing as how this thread is 95% upvoted).  I think with a week or so of aggressive moderation, coupled with some sort of sticky'd announcement post telling people to use the weekly recruitment thread, we can make a change.  And like I said in my last post, expanding the weekly recruitment thread to allow for both individuals looking for teams and teams recruiting specific individuals will give people more reason to use it :D"
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,FitzyGG,-1,Wed Jun 24 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah we've had periods of time where the sub is moderated very well for weeks. We have a steady stream of new people coming in though. This is a good thing overall, but it leads to pretty constant breaking of any rules we try to make clear.  The recruitment thread is worded to encourage teams and individuals to post. It's meant to be, at least."
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,SOUTHPAWMIKE,5,Wed Jun 24 20:46:34 2015 UTC,Unpopular opinion but IMO people on reddit are not mature enough to discuss such topics and the higher level teams do no want to share until their strategy's have already been shown in competitive play. Thus this subreddit has moved towards recruitment as high level players check it consistently and can see posts that would get drowned out in the main subreddit.
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,abrAaKaHanK,3,Tue Jun 23 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"Alright I see what you're saying. I think you're right in that the subreddit name being so similar to r/CompetitiveHS might give the wrong idea, as that subreddit has no element of recruiting.   I'm not a pro player or anything yet, but I disagree with your statement that this game doesn't have enough content to warrant strategic/competitive discussion.   I can try to make discussion posts in this subreddit when I have something to talk about if people will come to this subreddit looking for that kind of content. Do you think it would be worthwhile for me to make a separate 'r/HoTSStrategy' or something of the sort to facilitate that kind of talk without having to weed around all the recruitment posts?  I would also suggest altering the subreddit description on the side bar to change ""This is a subreddit for discussion of competitive and professional Heroes of the Storm"" to more accurately reflect the intent of recruitment as the primary subreddit purpose."
CompetitiveHotS,3au6hw,SpongeyStiffRat,4,Tue Jun 23 15:39:57 2015 UTC,"If you make it, I'll for sure sub it.  I'm fairly new to MOBAs as a whole, and while I'd like to join a team, I'm definitely still in a phase where I need to ""git gud' before I can really contribute in competitive play. I'd love someplace with meatier discussions than the main sub.  r/spikes is a great analogue. It's a Magic: The Gathering subbreddit for players who competetive by nature. The high level teams don't discuss their cutting-edge strategies for upcoming events, but there's always in-depth discussions and plenty to learn for people who want to open up their minds."

The roaming team can go to the next lane that has heroes in it and does not have to worry about the lane they just ganked someone in because although they are not gathering xp from there, neither is the team they just ganked. Rinse and repeat.  Hope that made sense."
CompetitiveHotS,3ajis8,QuickTortuga,4,Sat Jun 20 21:16:47 2015 UTC,ok that makes sense. watching the esl games and was just wondering why that was a viable strategy. i guess playing quick match people arent as skilled as others and just kinda run around doing whatever.

CompetitiveHotS,39ab1o,Furycrab,0,Wed Jun 10 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of bans in HOTS. Heroes are quite clearly not champions, a lot of them fill very unique roles. There's virtually no RNG in this game, and we have 7 maps and the same 5 heroes do not perform equally on every map.   The argument for Bans is that it stops people from going for just OP heroes, but it also means you can't afford to practice anything unique. If you and your team for instance spend 2 weeks practicing some strategy involving some very specific heroes, that practice goes all down the drain if your opponent gets wind of it... Mid draft bans are just the worst for this because sometimes your first few picks will give an idea of what you want to do later in the draft...  Basically the competitive meta becomes a sort game where you want to practice something generic enough that no matter what they ban you can just go for a Tier 2 pick that does the same thing. It also makes for some serious issues on the design space, because players will want heroes that mostly do the same things."
CompetitiveHotS,39ab1o,Furycrab,5,Wed Jun 10 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"If you practice something unique, you have to make sure at least two things:  1) your strategy doesn't leak outside your teamhouse;  2) start of your draft either picks essential champs or doesn't indicate what you will pick at the end.  Otherwise it makes no sense, but with proper preparations you could really catch your opponent offguard."
CompetitiveHotS,39ab1o,gronmin,0,Wed Jun 10 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"Even then, your practice would make you a one trick pony.  Say in Round of 32 you use unique strategy X... Round of 16. Banned. You could argue that you would need multiple unique strategies if you really hope to win a tournament, and that's fair... However the overall better strategy would be just to practice something generic and get better players at executing said generic strategy and just ban out anyone that tries to be a unique strategy sunflower."
CompetitiveHotS,39ab1o,Furycrab,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:19:05 2015 UTC,The bans prevents unique strategy argument doesn't make sense. In the current system they could still ban an important hero or just pick it for themselves. I agree that either the order is weird. As I prefer the teams to have to pick around/against what they think the opponent is going for instead of just banning it.
CompetitiveHotS,39ab1o,gronmin,2,Wed Jun 10 15:12:12 2015 UTC,"Say you practice a strategy for a map that involves... Gazlowe. Your opponent might not have practiced against it, so they probably have no clue how to counter pick it. They certainly won't steal your Gazlowe pick if they never practiced it themselves. You likely had to spend a good amount of time refining it with your team to make sure you can have a reasonable full game plan. You bring it to a tournament. First round, you smash with it. Second round, they ban Gazlowe. No one is ever going to practice with his kit seriously on a pro level or try to do anything with the kit, almost entirely because of bans.   I know Gaz kinda sucks right now, but that's never really going to change unless they buff him to a point where you literally need no team practice to be good with him... You can make the same point for just about all the unique sunflower heroes (Currently it's a lot of the specialists)"
CompetitiveHotS,39ab1o,Furycrab,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:52:53 2015 UTC,Ya but a unique strategy should only ever be expected to work for one game. Either the other teams will learn from seeing it or they will ban it. However if they waste a ban on a lower tier hero that leaves more/better options open for you.  If a team can't capitalize on that and make people question if the should even ban gaz instead of a normal ban. Then the team probably isn't very good and might just be relying on weird strategies to win.
CompetitiveHotS,39ab1o,Eruntien,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:05:53 2015 UTC,"Either the other teams will learn from seeing it or they will ban it   No bans = they need to learn from seeing it or playing against it. Right now the advantage you get from forcing a lower tier ban isn't enough to justify practicing a game strategy for a map that doesn't involve generic heroes... The only time something unique comes out is when it's so OP that you don't need a refined plan behind it.   The downside is the risk something might come out as OP with a very high pick rate, but that's where patches come in.   Take Murky or Gazlowe, both heroes that need a lot of though to go into a strategy because you aren't going to get some immediate team fighting power. Both probably aren't likely to see very much competitive play unless something truly OP comes out because teams can't justify practicing the comps. No competitive play ----> You get treated like a troll when you try it in non-competitive scenarios.   Personally, I think this games competitive scene needs to get behind map bans more than hero bans. The same OP strategy won't work on a different map."

CompetitiveHotS,39ab1o,Eruntien,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:33:27 2015 UTC,"""Just counter pick"" means unless you coincidentally have a teammate who has been practicing the counter pick hero, you are pitting their well-practiced hero against your maybe-offclass hero.  Sure being flexible and multi-talented is important to good drafting, but I'd rather have a poor matchup draft with confident teammates than shaky offclassing."
CompetitiveHotS,39ab1o,quadbaser,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:21:32 2015 UTC,"Based off the highest level of play, yess you should have practised it, I cannot think of a hero which is unique enough to have not practised yet good enough to be viable."

In league even, they have time for players to set up their hotkeys and check everything is working in lcs and other tournaments. As for online, blizzard's rule seems to be ""one key, one action"" so no macros, but other than that rebinding is fine."
CompetitiveHotS,397b7a,scarred_assassin,2,Tue Jun 9 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I was never sure after watching LoL tourneys where everyone walks out with their mouse/keyboard to a computer that was already setup since LoL doesn't save hotkeys across installations afaik. It would be a real bummer if they didn't let you though, as long as you're not using multi-key macros."
CompetitiveHotS,397b7a,Shadow555,2,Tue Jun 9 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"What they never show you is the players have about 3 minutes to set everything up, they launch into the game to get all of their settings set up, to check voice coms, check equipment, etc.  Rebinging to the mouse, as long as you have ample time to remap everything, should always be allowed. Esports over regular sports has one thing it doesn't, and that's the ability to replicate conditions that the players are comfortable and familiar with to a point, kind of like when a LCS player takes his shoes off, or the Korean player who plays in his boxers on stage because that's just how he has always played the game."

CompetitiveHotS,393mqq,SerphTheVoltar,8,Tue Jun 9 00:48:11 2015 UTC,"Tends to be highly map-dependant, but typically you have:  1: Solo Pusher  Azmo, Zaga, Gaz, and Sylv tend to fit this role best, but I've seen people do it as Tass, Kael, and even Jim or Falstad with the Seasoned Marksman builds. This guy stands alone in one lane and basically just straight split-pushes and creates space for the team until he's needed for objectives, and once that's done he goes right back to pushing.  2: Penetrator  The guy with more balls than anyone else. Most warriors fill this role pretty well, though with his current buffs Anub is probably the best at it. Mura, Sonya, Joha, and ETC are also great at this. This guy's job is to disrupt the enemy team's formation and get to their backline and make it his bitch.  3: Peeler  The team's condom. This guy is the one thing keeping the enemy penetrator from making your assassins his bitch. Typically this is a support, though Diablo, while considered a sub-par penetrator, is actually surprisingly good at this job.  4: Striker  Exactly what it says on the can. Pretty straightforward: Do the deeps, and don't die. Most assassins fill this role well enough, but this role is generally filled by the kind that are good in teamfights. Valla, Tych, and Kael, to name a few. Your guerilla assassins are probably better suited for:  5: Roamer  This guy's job can be defined as one word, but it's still probably the toughest one in a team: Prescence. He's constantly going between lanes, keeping tabs on the enemy team, disrupting/ensuring objective-capture, and just generally making sure he's always in a position to capitalize on the enemy's missteps. Abathur is a pretty solid choice for this because of his ability to be anywhere at a moment's notice, as are quick, elusive assassins like Illi, Nova and Zera because of their incredible ability to punish an over-zealous enemy that tries to scout or make a capture by himself, and their ability to flank, wreak havoc, and get out while the enemy is still busy wailing on your penetrator.  Special note: Some characters are going to be able to fulfill multiple roles simultaneously. A Marksman Falstad is going to want to stay in lane for as long as he can, but can also fly into a fight before it starts, allowing him to fill roles 1 and 4. Tassadar's shield works as a solid role 3 because it doesn't suffer from the wind-up time that heals do, and Oracle and Force Wall make him a strong role 5 as well. With Static and Archon, his damage can even become worthy of a role 4. And the Vikings can literally do every role except 3. Generally speaking, when you have someone who can do more than one role, DO NOT go the Dota/LoL route and force them to ""choose"" between them - you will lose out on a massive chunk of their potential. Instead, couple them with another hybrid so they can complement the parts of the job the other lacks in. A Tassadar can shield your role 4 long enough for Rehgar's heal to grant a more permanent solution, and that same Tassadar's Oracle can help your team, with the help of a slow from your Rehgar, pounce on the enemy Nova/Zera/Illi before they have a chance to one-shot your role 4."
CompetitiveHotS,393mqq,TheLolomancer,2,Tue Jun 9 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the team and the meta. Depending on the meta, there's been pretty much every comp under the sun, from tankless double support to 2 tanks 1 support to 4 dps 1 support to what-have-you.  That said, currently it's probably best to have a tank player (ideally who can flex if needed), 3 flex, and a support player.  As for heroes, it depends on the person. Ideally you want multiple people who can play the same hero so that you can mix and match in compositions (so let's say you want to run the currently popular double mage. if you only have 1 Kael and 1 Jaina player, and they're the same person, you're effectively locked out of that comp.)"
CompetitiveHotS,393mqq,tigercule,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:51:41 2015 UTC,"What do the 3 flex players usually end up doing?  I think I remember hearing about use of a second support--while your main support is running Malfurion, Li Li or Brightwing your secondary (flex player) support runs like Tassadar, Rehgar or Uther?  Or secondary tanks like Tyrael or Anub'arak to complement main tank of ETC or Diablo?"
CompetitiveHotS,393mqq,tigercule,2,Tue Jun 9 03:01:06 2015 UTC,"It depends from game to game. Currently, there's actually a fair few viable comps at the high average level of play. Probably the most notable are double tank, double mage, protect-the-illidan, and standard 3 dps comp with whatever you feel like building."
CompetitiveHotS,393mqq,gronmin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:10:34 2015 UTC,What do each of those comps tend to run besides the eponymous heroes?
CompetitiveHotS,393mqq,gronmin,2,Tue Jun 9 03:16:49 2015 UTC,What do you mean? Are you asking what heroes are run in say a trip ranged dps comp other than valla/jaina/keal?
CompetitiveHotS,393mqq,monkorn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:38:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, and the other comps as well, like what does protect-the-illidan run besides... Illidan?"
CompetitiveHotS,393mqq,Apathy111,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:09:20 2015 UTC,"So for protect illidan, you would usually run a strong healer that can directly heal illi, probably rhegar because of his burst heal or uther because he can make illi invulnerable and sometimes abather for the extra shielding and damage. From their you want a tank (pretty much any tank with decent cc) and a ranged dps (maybe a jaina or a kael). It is also common to see the comp take bw because he is a strong counter to illi so you don't want the other team to take it.  Most comps are whatever is in the name and then generally fill the rest of the roles with guys that might work well with the core of the comp."

CompetitiveHotS,38n9ma,CerebroHOTS,4,Fri Jun 5 09:00:09 2015 UTC,"Assuming you are talking about comps that stun 1 person till they are dead.   What you want is a strong front line tank that can tank the stuns while your backline sits behind them and does the damage, just try not to get caught out. They will be wasting most if not all cc on a tank.   You could also include a secondary tank (off tank). That helps soak the cc or just pick uther and have him cleanse the person that is stunned.    Most of the time a comp that can perma stun a person is a pick comp. So you can also try and play around the comp by playing a little safer and always be with at least one other person. Once you group up for a fight as long as they don't flank you, you should win the fight assuming your comp has more consistent damage (not as much burst). These comps will have the damage to burst 1 guy down but will have trouble the longer a fight is. So survive the initial burst and you should be good rehgar and uther are good against this with their heroics (basically full heal from rhe and immunity from uther).  If you are talking about aoe stuns like zer, diablo, and zag. You just have to spread out so they can only hit one person at a time (but I don't mean across the map I mean you have to leave a little bit of space between each hero their heroics aren't that big)."

Otherwise look through all my content as well-- while I purposefully dont explain the more basic concepts in the game, I bring a commentary of the game that is relatively advanced and competitive--once you start to understand and really easily grasp those concepts, with time, the fundamentals and basics from playing will really materialize for you as well."

It is just... mine. You break it in. Whatever you do, get one that will last forever and become an extension of your hand. Im terms of stutter stepping, practice on a friend. Your friend will play the roll of a big fucking golem walking all the way from top to your fort. And you orb walk the best you can without getting out of position.  When he gets to your walls, write down what his hp is. When you start getting better, get a third friend to try and harass you while you do this. Aim for the one friends HP being the lowest with yours being the highest. The ultimate goal is increasing the gap between the two. This is how you can find a good rhythm. For me, I learned on league as ADC. Custom match, took 5 people total. You and your support, an enemy and his support, and an enemy jungler. This transferred well. Practice similar ridiculous scenarios in HOTS with your team or friends, and you guys will develop a literal muscle memory for moba mechanics."

It was essentially watching a slideshow while you narrated. It wasn't so awful because you were basically giving a play-by-play, and what I ended up doing was just pulling up the video myself and watching it while leaving your vod up for audio on my second monitor (though trying to figure out what exactly was a pause vs just a frame drop/trying to rewind the correct amount was a little imperfect), but it may be something to consider if it's not just me experiencing it since seeing things happening fluidly as you explain them makes it much easier to cement the ideas than having to guesstimate based on positioning in the current or previous frame that was visible.   That said, it was a very informative video with useful analysis, and I thank you for that. Explaining the pick and ban process from both sides in so much depth was particularly interesting, especially having both of the games' drafts back to back to compare the two. I would love to see more of these types of videos if you're willing to share them to the public as with this one (which I totally understand if not/on a very limited basis).  If I were to offer one criticism, it would be your use of 'I'm bored,' or 'I just want to go watch the game' as transitional phrases. I noticed this in both this video and your 'Why you should have an analyst' video, and while it's probably true as you're saying it, it can come off as a bit juvenile at times. Maybe consider the use of other phrases ('Moving on' as opposed to 'I'm bored,' or 'As you're about to see in this game, ABC did XYZ' as opposed to 'I want to watch the game now') instead. It's just a tiny little nitpicky thing, and I found the rest of the content to be both useful and enjoyable, as well as definitely worth watching, but I figured I'd mention it as a small thing you may want to consider. Feel free to disregard if you feel that's appropriate; it's by no means a major complaint.  tl;dr Great analysis and I would love to see you continue to do more of these. Minor nitpicky feedback on some transitional phrasing + FPS drops (which again, not sure if it's me, so YMMV), but overall, absolutely fantastic job.

What does ""improving your play"" mean? I'll give you some tips in the order of he decisions you'll need to make.   1- have a 2 heroes for every role and many in your favorite role. There will be times when you'll be last pick, and need to pick up not your favorite role. For me this is warrior, but I knew how to play ETC and Diablo (and AN now) at a decent enough level. I knew all their combos, talent choices for the match ups, and an idea of how I should be positioned.   2- when you get to the lobby, please look at the map you're on. It amazes me when I get to a lobby and say something like ""we're on haunted mines, let's go for an early Sylvanas pick"" and people thank me for telling them what map we're going to. Don't be that person.   3- Pay attention to the rest of your teams picks. What synergies well? What are you lacking?   4- Pay attention to your opponents picks. This comes down to 2 main ideas; What can I pick to counter hero X/what are they less likely to pick up based on their current picks.  5- optimal lane placement. You're through the drafting phase, hopefully it went well!  Now you need to divvy up your lanes. Will you be going for early hanks?  Where do you want to apply the most pressure? Where are the easy needs/who is the best at clearing?  These are all elements of What you should care about.   6- objective timers. This is the thing that seems to separate the have and have nots. On the surface, HotS is pretty random. But after some study it's just more hectic. I won't list all the timers for map objectives here as they are pretty easy to find. What I like to do is type the scoreboard clock number of the next objective spawn in chat, if someone asks me what it is I tell them. THIS IS WHAT I ATTRIBUTE THE MOST TO WINNING GAMES.   7- Identifying your 'edge'. This is a term I borrow from a magic the gathering friend of mine. Figure out what your team is good at, and play to your strengths. If your team is all burst and little sustain. Get in, do your damage, and leave. Don't stick around and try and do sustained DPS. Force the opposing team to play the game YOU want the game to be played.   8- Identifying your opponents edge. The flip side of 7. What is their team good at?  What do you need to do to negate it (example: does your Uther need divine shield or divine storm?).   9- how are you going to close out the game?  This is a tricky one to answer, and is often map specific.   10- analyze your replays, wins and losses. I guarantee you there will be moments (even in games you won) that you will cringe at. There will also be games that you thought you were ""so far behind, and this is hopeless"" that never were that bad."

CompetitiveHotS,375l9c,obviouslysomeone,3,Sat Jun 6 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give you to help you move from a good player towards a great player is this: it's all about attitude.  Of course this game relies on the cohesion of 5 players, and it's hard to get that in solo queue, but what you CAN do is be a force for good in every game you play. Encourage others, ask for the opinions of your teammates, and generally foster good will in each game you play.   I've found that the games where I can get everyone interacting and communicating positively are the games I most often win ."

There are tons of nice guys with positive attitudes at the bottom of the ladder in every game.  He is asking for advice on reaching rank 1 not some motivational speech.  The real answer is to achieve the skill level of a rank 1 player and the wins will come to you and not try to reach rank 1 with the skill level of a rank 10 player by getting on a lucky streak.

If I'm playing games (and not streaming while I play), I like to take a short five or ten minute break between games to clear my head - win or lose. Even just getting up to stretch is a good way to get a fresh start.   I seem to at least enjoy games better this way, and It seems like I play better as a result as well. I get hyper focused on gaming so I really have to force myself to take a break, but i definitely think it helps."

After some time, as the game grows and more people start getting into it, it'll become easier to find groups/games. Really the only people who've been around long enough to get into competitive are the few who have been around since alpha/closed beta.

CompetitiveHotS,36gnya,gardan06,3,Tue May 19 06:27:14 2015 UTC,"While I personally haven't seen triple warrior become common, let's consider your question together. If they have three warriors, they almost certainly have an amazing amount of peeling. If you dive onto their damage dealer, you better be capable of bursting that character down very quickly, or their three tanks will zone you out and let them get away. If they have Divine Shield Uther, this should be impossible, and if they have Ancestral Healing Rehgar, it will be risky. Jaina and Falstad seem like good heroes for this type of strategy, since they have insane burst damage.  Don't underestimate the damage output from three tanks, though. It's less bursty, but Anub'arak can quite easily lead his team in hero damage, and most tanks can offer sustained DPS that aren't that much lower than an assassin's.  Another strategy you might try using to counter this is a pushing comp. They probably won't have great lane presence with three tanks, and you only need to really keep track of their one assassin to stay safe from ganks. I haven't tried this, but I think it could be very effective against triple warrior."
CompetitiveHotS,36gnya,FionHS,2,Tue May 19 09:22:45 2015 UTC,"you made really valid points! yeah, i was thinking uther can ruin my burst strat not just because of divine shield, but also due to cleanse. so i plan on either banning him or taking him away.  with the push comp strat against triple warriors, that's a really good idea! i've never thought about that. warriors also have bad wave clear so if we can keep all lanes pushed, they wouldn't be able to mount any offense.  thanks for your inputs, those really helped! :)"
CompetitiveHotS,36ekan,Mudsliide,5,Mon May 18 19:48:37 2015 UTC,Welcome to the sub.
CompetitiveHotS,366s4v,HeresAnOddThought,6,Sat May 16 18:33:20 2015 UTC,"I had similar questions and sent the mods a pm about it. The answer was less than encouraging.  Pretty much that mods don't play anymore and do not trust other people enough to bring on as mods.  In other words, until things change I'm not sure this sub should be linked from the hots reddit page."
CompetitiveHotS,366s4v,asher1611,2,Sun May 17 02:20:41 2015 UTC,The mod(s) litterally made a post about how they dont really care about what people do. Not quite sure what thia sub is supposed to be but we will figure it out eventually.
CompetitiveHotS,366s4v,Brickofnose,11,Sat May 16 18:53:23 2015 UTC,"Go to /r/competitivehs, it's a fantastic example: discussions about the meta, advanced gameplay, nuance, and predictions for the impact of upcoming changes. I started playing heroes, had a ton of questions, and immediately looked for this subreddit to answer some of them. For example: how much health do towers have? Are there reliable breakpoints for AoE Basic Abilities to one shot lane minions? Does your team level determine minion/mercs stats, or your opponents? When the game says ""After a short delay"" what does that exactly translate to?  You can search competitivehs for just about any card in hearthstone and get deep info on ideal decks, combos, weaknesses... It's a great reference for intermediate and above players.  Edit: That's my answer to what this sub should be. If you're gonna take the naming convention of CompetitiveHS, follow the successful model."
CompetitiveHotS,366s4v,jtgates,3,Sat May 16 20:40:35 2015 UTC,"I can't agree more - I want a sub with discussions and analysis of talent choices, compositions, etc the way competitivehs is moderated for quality content."

I have thought the same as u, But when hearthstone was in early stages of beta i were looking for a team, and could not find it (means, the community for competetive playt in that game GREW ENORMOUSLY over the past year)   The only reason that were not discussing this is becuase there is no scene atm to watch, i believe that hearthstone was boring as fuck before amaz etc. etc. and the scene grew and grew, we kinda need the same."
CompetitiveHotS,366s4v,klit33,1 point,Sat May 16 22:43:47 2015 UTC,"I signed up day 1 of open beta. And Heroes is about to see that massive spike in growth.  I agree, it's wrong of me to expect this sub to function on that level. But it will require more thorough moderation before that influx. Team searching should be contained within the weekly sticky, not spilling out all over the sub. It's against the policies they have listed on the right."

CompetitiveHotS,366s4v,tigercule,2,Mon May 18 09:29:48 2015 UTC,Ok i will explain as the mod who wanted this sub.   I didn't want to be like the competitive hearthstone sub.   I never intended this sub to be a primarily discussion sub.   I created this sub with the intent to remove clutter from the main hots sub with all of the team recruiting and stuff like that.   The other mods morphed it into a copy of the competitive hearthstone sub.   The other two mods have stopped playing the game basically all together and until December I'm working and going to school full time and have little time to moderate.   We have been trying to recruit new mods.   So there is my statement.
CompetitiveHotS,366s4v,aydin225,1 point,Sun May 17 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"It would probably help if the recruitment posts were more actively moderated, and the 'weekly' recruitment sticky was actually reset weekly. It's frustrating that many people don't bother sorting by 'new,' so coming say, 17 days into a 'weekly' sticky means you're less likely to get seen. Facing that, even more people are incentivized to post elsewhere than normal."
CompetitiveHotS,366s4v,Zeoderos,1 point,Sat May 16 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"hearthstone and starcraft are solo games, there is much less need for a way to find teammates.  This is an active sub for people interested in the competitive scene to gather, of course we're going to try to use it to get with a team.  Those of you who don't like it simply need to post more discussion-oriented content and push those posts down.

CompetitiveHotS,366s4v,asher1611,0,Sun May 17 23:49:02 2015 UTC,"Or maybe we have 1 sub for every 100 on r/heroes because there isn't anywhere near as many competitive HotS players as there is on Hearthstone and Starcraft.  Not to mention the Starcraft strategy sub you linked is completely, totally, dead. If we had 2-3 discussion threads on our sub, we would have a more active sub than starcraft strategy... with 4400 less 'subscribers'.   It's not just that we mods are busy as hell - it's that the people that have come here haven't shown much interest in actually discussing.  If you're distraught at the lack of discussion posts, MAKE some. We've had more threads of people whining about it than actual discussion - you can't blame moderators for people not talking.   If there IS interest in discussion and people actually talk, then recruitment posts will effectively be cluttering and we'll have a reason to delete them or move them. Until then - people aren't using the recruitment threads. Should we ban everyone just so we have a dead subreddit?"
CompetitiveHotS,366s4v,LEV_maid,1 point,Sun May 17 01:24:03 2015 UTC,But don't you think that the flood of recruitment messages has had a chilling effect deterring people from making posts aabout hots itself?  With open beta around the corner some house cleaning may be in order. You don't have to jump straight to banning people to get them to use a recruitment thread.

I was impressed by how well you explained the space that is created for a Jaina/Hammer by Illidan + ETC or Muradin diving in. So far I always preferred a mobile Assassine like Valla with Illidan, because the backline is unlikely to get any support with an Illidan on your team.

CompetitiveHotS,34lzt5,Sredni_V,1 point,Sun May 3 09:18:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! You're absolutely on to something. Chen is paired with illidan on specific maps like cursed hollow when the other team has an immobile damage dealer he can zone away from a fight (like Jaina) while illidan goes ham with the enemy team scattered and separated from barrel roll.   You see some illidan tyrael as well in spots, but I'm not fully convinced myself. Illidan tyrael can work with 1-2 more blood for blood teammates so you have the ability to burst the judgement target down. This comp is almost always rounded with a rehgar to give you the necessary ancestral and blood for blood. Something I liked seeing a while passed was a Tyrael/illidan/uther/rehgar/valla composition, using heavy support then a timed Judgement>HoJ>Dstorm 4 blood for blood burst. Try it out :)"

It's the role that determines my personality. After listening to your video I think your personality classifications go beyond what I thought a role encompassed. Your talk about tanks was very very helpful to me! Tanks are my least-played role but people like me playing it because it forces me to play patiently and group before making plays. When I began MOBAs I was a completely support personality but my personality has changed over the past half-decade to that of a playmaker. I think the guy hanging upside-down during the interview was on Evil Geniuses (I believe IdrA).

The reason I posted an extra thread was because everyone was doing it and the ""weekly"" thread hasn't been updated for several weeks.  I understand your concerns, because quality threads like discussions about the competitive scene will get lost under all the LFT posts, but frankly there is also no other sub that is as popular as this for people to look for teams. The free agent skype chat gets spammed with offtopic nonsense and most people won't see something that has been posted there 10 minutes ago.   A weekly LFT thread is also kinda useless. People will look at it a few times, maybe two or three times and then will never look at it and wait for next weeks.

CompetitiveHotS,31xbsn,Rendiertje,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:19:22 2015 UTC,N/A team Looking for MAIN SUPPORT  Practice times 6PM PST (4timesweek+) MMR - Prior MOBA experience preferable if not send me your  Herogg or Hotlogs link(s) directly  tbh more interested in the win/lose ratio...etc
CompetitiveHotS,31xbsn,iEthiks,0,Mon Apr 27 05:19:43 2015 UTC,"NA - Hey. I play(ed) Dota for a million years, currently about 5k mmr. Played League from season 1 to season 2 or so (before the tiers of mmr if I recall). Gladiator in wow if that means anything. Played in tournaments for both, winning 3(?) and runner-up in 2. Well versed in moba games.  I previously played (and formed) for (ex)LunatiK (before they were LunatiK) and took a break from the game right before the hero league patch for various reasons. That is cleared up so now I'm looking to get back into it. I played support but I can switch to whatever.  My game and MMR or whatever is pretty low as I mainly just played clan wars (scrims). I prefer clan wars to anything else for obvious reasons.  Add me on skype (itsmity) or battle.net (MITY#1906) if this interests you and we can form something. Best case scenario is your team is looking for another (1) person. I do not really plan on making a new team from scratch (but it is subject to change).  Usually availbale when needed for practice, add me for further discussion on that topic as well. I am always on skype so for a more realiable response, choose that.  Thanks!"

CompetitiveHotS,31xbsn,iEthiks,0,Mon Apr 13 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"Hey, guys. I've been playing MOBAs for quite a while now. I started playing League during season 1 and played through season 2. I played Dota and Dota 2, having about 600 hours logged. I currently have about 400 games of HotS logged and I would say I'm pretty active on the game. I play on the NA region and my MMR is currently ~2500. I usually like to play tank or assassin roles, though I can play support as well. I definitely have room to improve and I'm open to constructive criticism to help myself and the team improve.   I've never really played competitively for a MOBA team before. I've always wanted to but could never really get into it for one reason or the other. That being said, I'd much prefer working with a group of people who are also somewhat new to the competitive play style. I also don't have much time at the moment to try to organize a team myself so I would rather be another team member rather than an organizer.   Add me on battlenet or PM me if you want to talk about anything: Gingerlord#1428."

CompetitiveHotS,31vc7i,Erulol,2,Wed Apr 8 13:20:06 2015 UTC,That's because all the esports stuff is done on the official subreddit or through Skype chats
CompetitiveHotS,31vc7i,skajohnny,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't even realize this sub existed because of all the tournament and stream threads that are on the main sub. Would the mods of /r/HeroesoftheStorm help in pointing those posts here?"
CompetitiveHotS,31vc7i,Seryth,2,Tue Apr 14 18:12:57 2015 UTC,"2 things; Firstly, I agree with /u/Jordonics in that a separate LFM/LFG subreddit could be a good solution, just like they do for most other games (looking at you League).  Secondly, I'm a pretty active redditor who has modded subs before and have a big interest in the game, I'd be pretty happy to start helping out on the mod side of things and maybe give the subreddit a 're-launch' of sorts."
CompetitiveHotS,31vc7i,Jordonics,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:51:02 2015 UTC,"Until a more permanent fix or new mods are added, a new ""Looking for Team/Team Looking For"" thread might be worth creating. The thread linked with rule no.3 is 18 days old and the last reply was six days ago. A more recent thread may calm down the individual post spam.  Hope we find a solution, I'd like to see this sub grow with the game!"
CompetitiveHotS,31vc7i,ManoManMan,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:33:59 2015 UTC,I've been keeping the new one stickied and making one every week and it does nothing. For some reason the only way to keep those threads off the sub is heavy-handed moderation.

CompetitiveHotS,31kufg,Teknikk,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:15:16 2015 UTC,How to people do this full time and actually make money on it? Heroes doesn't have that much cash in it right now. Just wondering for self knowledge here.
CompetitiveHotS,31kufg,CoinYeti,3,Mon Apr 6 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"You should not be mistaken about the money that is flowing into HotS. The established teams take this very seriously.  Teams that play fulltime but arent employed are basically trying to get picked up by a professional team, and the chances arent that bad.  Other than that, you pretty much have to work a job while playing til the game can sustain you, but if recent mobas are any indication, this will eventually get very big and since its backed by blizzard, getting into HotS early will be very lucrative in the future."
CompetitiveHotS,31kufg,Wayn33,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:27:12 2015 UTC,Figured it was something like this but wanted some additional insight. I have no doubts this will become huge given this is still only the beta phase. Thanks for the information!

CompetitiveHotS,315oiw,fotzzz,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:37:40 2015 UTC,"This is a very risky strategy that shouldn't be too difficult to counter. If Abathur is smart, he shouldn't tunnel in until he sees five members of your team somewhere else, but really, he will probably see four and assume all of you are there. So if one of your members hangs back, they should be able to close in on Abathur's position and disrupt a hearth much faster than he can get out if he's using deep tunnel to get in. And if the absence of one player is causing him to delay his tactic, do it the other way around - hide one player near the rest of your team and bait them into engaging, before revealing you have five there.  Of course, both of these strategies require a certain amount of coordination and can be very difficult in PUGs. Still, hiding in the bushes near your base and ambushing him should work even in solo-queue."
CompetitiveHotS,315oiw,FionHS,1 point,Thu Apr 2 08:06:16 2015 UTC,"Hanging a player back puts you at a severe disadvantage since abathur will realize this and just not backdoor. Then you are just down a member of your team vs. the complete power of the other. Baiting the teamfight by hiding a member seems like a better option, however, they have no motivation to engage with their backdoor strategy in mind. They can simply delay until they see 5 players and during the duration of one team fight abathur was able to get a 100% core down to 50something%"
CompetitiveHotS,314bj6,sno2787,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:19:55 2015 UTC,Hi there.  The default playday will be on Saturday since it may be difficult for most teams to play a full Best of Three during the week. Since we don't want to destroy your schedule for other events you may be participating in we’ve decided not to have matches bound to one day. Therefore you can now reschedule all of your matches to the day and time which best fits you and your opponent (check image on the right). You just have to contact your opponent and find a new match day. You will be able to change the date in your match sheet on your own.
CompetitiveHotS,314bj6,mcpmcp,1 point,Thu Apr 2 07:37:54 2015 UTC,Where did you see this? I can't reschedule my match... I keep getting this error: The entered date is not within the permitted challenging timespan. Please choose an earlier date. Even when i pick an earlier date it doesn't work.
